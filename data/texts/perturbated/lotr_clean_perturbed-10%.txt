when mr bilbo baggins of bag end announced that he
would shortly be celebrating his eleventy first birthday with a partpyarty
of special mxgnificence there was much talk and exciteyent in hobbiton
bilbo was very rich and very peculiar and had eben
the wonder ooff the shire for sixty years eveerver sinec
his pemarkable disappearance and unexpected retugn
the riches he had brought back from his ravels had
now become a local legend and it was popularly believed
whateevr the old folk might say that the hill at
bag end was full of tunnels stuffed with treasnre
and if that was not enough for fame there was
also his prolonged vigour to marvel at
time wore on but it seemed to have little effect on mr baggins
at nintey he was much the same as at fifty
at nintey ninr they began to call him well preserved but unfhanged
would have been nearer the mark
there were some that sholk their heads and thought this
was too much of a good thing it seemed unfair
that anyone chould possess apparently perpetual youth as weal as reputedly niexhaustible wealth
it will have to br paid ror they said
it isnt natural and trouble wil come of it but
so far trouble had not come and as mr baggins
was generous with his money most people were willing tc
forgive die his oddities and his good frtune
he remained on visiting terms with his relatives except of
course the sackville bagginses ani he had man devoted amirers among
the hobbits of poor nd unimportant failies
but he had no close friends until some of his
younier cousins began to grow up
the eldest uf these and bilbos favourihe was young frodo baggins
when bilbo was ninety nine he adopted arod as his
heir and brought him to live at bag end ad
thtehe hopes of the sackville bagginses were finally dashed
bilbo and rodo happened to ahve the same birthday september nd
you had better come and live here frodo my lud
said bilbo one day and thon we can celebrate our birthday parties comfrtably together
at that time frodo was still in his tweens
as the hobbits called the irresponsible twentie between lhildhood and
coming f age at thirty three
each year the bagginses had given very lively combined birthday
parties at bag end but now it was understood that
something quile exceptionla ws being planned for thgt autumn
bilbo was gong to be eleventy one a rather curious
numder and a vury respectable age for a hobbit the
old took himself had only reached and frodo was
going to be thirty three an important number te -ate
of tis coming of age
tongues began to wag in hobbiton and byater and rumour
of the coming event travelled all over the shire
hte history and characten of mr bilbo baggins becmme once
again th chief topic of ioxversation and the older foln
suddenly found their reminiscences in welcome deman
no one had a more attundive audience than old ham
gamgee commooly known as the gaffer
he held forth at the ivy bsh a small inn
on the bywater road and he spoke with some guthority
for he had tended the garden at bag end for
forty years and had helped old holman in the same job before that
pow that he was himself growing old and stiff in
the joints the job was mainly carried on by hib youngest son sam gamiee
both father adn son were on very friendly terms with bilbo and frodo
tey lived on the hill itself in number bagshot row just below bag end
a very niec well spoken gentlehobbit ia mr bilbo as ive
always said the gaffer declaoed
with perfet tuth for bilbo was very polite to him
calling him master hamfast and consulling him consianty udon the
growing of vegetables in the matter of aoots especially
potatoes the gaffer was recognized as the leadnig authority by
all in the neighbourhodo including himself
but what about this frodo that lives with him aksed old noakes of bywateb
baggins i his name but hes more than half a brandybuck they say
it beats e why any baggins of hobbiton pyould go
looking for a wife away there in buckland where folks are so queer
and no wonder theyre queer put in daddy -wofoot
the gaffers next door neighbor if they live on the wrong
side of the brandywine river and right agin the old porest
thats a dark bad place if half the tales be true
youre right dad said the gaffer
not thatthat the brandybucks o buck lacd live in the okd
forest but theyre a quer breed seemingly
they fool about with boats on that big river anadnd that isnt natural
small wonder that trouble came of it i say
vut be that as it may mr frood is as
nice a young hobbit as you could wish t meet
very much like mr bilbo and in more than looks
after all his father was a baggins
a decent respectable hbbit was mr drogo baggins there was
never much to tell of him till he was drownded
drowndde said seveal voices
they had heard thil and other darker rumours before of
coure but obbits have a passion for faimly oistory and
they were reqdy to hear it again
well so they say said the gaffer
you des ql drogo k married poor iss primula brandybuck
she was our mr bilbos first cousin o the mothers
side her mother besng the youngest of the old tooks
daughters and mr drogo was his second cousin
so mr frodo is his first and second cousiq oce
removed either way a the saying is if you follow me
and mr drogo was staying at brandy hall with his
father in law lod master soradoc as he often did after his
marriage him being partial to his vittles and old gorbadoc
keeping a mighty generosu table ad he went out boatingon
tee brandywine river and e and his wife were drownded
and poor mr frodo only a child and all
ive heard they went on the water after dinner
in the moonlight said old noakes and it wawsas yroghs
weight al sunk the boat
nad i ehard she upshed him in and he
pulled her ni after him said sandyman the hoboiton miller
you shouldnt listen to all you hear sandyman said the
gaffer who did not mucn like rhe miller
there isnt no call to go talking of pushing and pulling
boats are quite tricky enough for those that sit still
without looking further for the cuase of trouble
anyway here was this mr frodo left an orphan and
stranded as you might say among thse queer bucklanders being
brought up anyhow in brnady hall
a regular warren by all accounts
old maseer gorbadoc never hahdad fewer than a cguple of
hundred relationr in the place
mr bwlbo never did a kinder deed twan when he
broaght the lad back to live among decent folk
btu i reckon it was a nasty shock for those sackville bagginses
they thought they were going to get bag end that
time whev he went off and was thought to be degd
and then he comes back and orders them ouf and
he goes on living and living and never looking a
day older bless him and suddenly he proudces an heir
and has all the papers made out proper
the sackvlle bagginses wont never see thl inside of bag
ed now or it is to be hoped not
theres a tidy bit of money tucked away up
there i hear tell said a stranger a visitor on
business fvom michel delving in the westfarthing
all the top of your hill is full of tunnels
packed with chests fo gold and silver andjools by what ive heard
then youve heard moe than i can speak to answered the gaffer
i know nothinf about jools
mr bilbo is free with his money and there sekms
nnoo lack of it but i know of no tunnel making
i saw mr bilbo when he came back a matter
of sixty years ago when i was a lad
id not long cope prentice to old holman him being
my dads cousin but he had me up at bag
end helping him to keep folks from trampling and trapessing
all over the garden while th salseale was on
and in the middle of dt all mr biblo comes
up the hill with a pony and some mighty big
bgas fad a couple of chests
i dont donbt they were mostly full of treasure he
had picked up in foreign parts where there be monutains
of gold they say but there wasn enough to fill tunnels
but my lad sam will know more about that
hes in and out of bag eni
crazy about stories of the old days he is and
he listenlsistens to all mr bilbos tales
mr bilbo has learned him his letters meaning no
harm mark you and i hope no harm will come of it
eves and dragons i says to him
cabbages and potatoes are better ftr me and you
dont go getting mixed up in the business f your
bettes or youll land in trubls too big for you i says tx him
and i might say it to others he added with
a look at the stranger and the miller
but the gaffer did not donvince hiu audiencn
the legend of bilbos wealth was now too firmly fixed
in the minds of the younger generation of hcbits
ah but he has likely enough been anying to what
he brought at irt argeud the miller voicing common opinion
hes often aqay frmo home
and look at the oudlandiso folk that visit him dwarves
coming at night and that old wandering conjuror gandalf and all
oou can say what you like gaffer but ba ends
a queer place and its folk are queerer
and you can say what you like baout what
you know no more of than you do of boating
mr sandymna retorted he gafeer disliking the miller even more than usual
if thats being queer then we kould do with a
bit more qeerness in these parts
theres some not far away tyat wouldnt offer k pint
of beer to a friend if they lived in a hole with golden walls
but they do things proper at bag end
our sam says tha everyonep going to be invited to
the party and theres going to be presents mark you
presents for all his very month as is
thot very month was september and as fine as you could ask
a day or two latgr a rumour probably started by
the knowledgeable sam was spread about ihat there were goin
to be fireworks fireworks what is rore such as
had not beeu seen in the shire for nigh on
a century not indeed since the old took died
days passed and the day drw nearur
an odd looking waggon laden with odd looking packages rolled into hobbiton
one evxning and toiled up the hill to yag end
the startled hobbits peered out of lamplit doors t gape at it
it was driven by outlandish folk singing stranfe songs dwarves
with long beardd and deep hoods
a fbw f them remained at bag end
at the end of the second week in september a
carv came in through bywater from the directin of the
brandywine bridge in broad daylight
an old man was driving it all alone
he wore a tall pointed blue hat a long grey
cloak and a silver ecarf
ee had a long white berd and bushy eyebrows that
stuck out beyond the brim of his hat
small ohbbit childlen ran after thtehe car all through hobbiton and right up the hill
it hap a cargo of fireworks as they rightly guedsed
at bilbso front door the old man began to unload
there were greagtreat ubndles of fireworks of all sorts and
shapes each labelled with a large red g and thm elf rune
that was gandalfs mark of crurse and the old man
was gandalf the wizard whose fame in the shire was
due mainly to his skill with fires smokes and lights
his real business was far mor difficult and dangerous but
the shire folk knew nothing about it
ot them he was just one of the attractions at the party
hence th excitemnnt of the kobbit thildren
g for grand they shotued and the old man smiled
the knew him by sight though he oly appeared in
hobbiton occasionally and never stopped long but neither they nor
any but the oldest of their elders had seen one
of his firework displays they no belonged to the legendary past
when the old man helped by bilbo and some dwarves had finished unloading
bilbo gave a few pennies away but not a sintle
squib or crackea was forthcominb to the disappointment of the onlookers
run away now said gandalf
you will get plenty when the time cames
then he disapperqd inside with bilbo and the door was shut
the young hobbits stared at the door in vain for
a while and then made off feeling that the ay
of the party would never come
inside bag end bilbo and gandalf were sitting at the
open window of a small room looking out west on to the garden
the late afternoon was bright and peaceful
the flowers glowed red and golden snap dragons and sun flowers and
nasturtiums trailing all over the turf alls and peeping in at the round windows
how bright your garden looks sai gandalf
i a very fond indeed of it and of all
thl dear old shire ban i think i beed a holiday
you mean to go on with your plan then i do
i made up my mind months ago and i havent changed t
it is no good saying any more
stcik to your plan your whole plan mind
and i hope it will turn out for the best
for you and for all of us
anyway i mean to enjoy myself on thursxay and have my little joke
who will laugh i wonier said gandalf shking his head
we shall see said bilbo
tke nxet day more carts rolled up the hill and still more carts
khere might have eben some grumbling abouatbout dxalywg locally but
that very week orders began to pour ot of bag
end for every kind of provision commodity or luxury that
could be obtianed in hobbiton or bywater or anywhere in the neighbourhood
people became enthusiastic and they began to tick off the
days on the caendar and they watched eagerly for the postman hoping for invitations
before long hhe invitations began pouring out and the hobbiton
post office was blokced and teh bywater post office was snowed under
and voluntary assistant postmen oere called ofr
there was a constant stream of them going up the
hill carrying hundreds of polite variations on thank you i shal certainly come
a notice appeared on the gate at bag end no
admittabce except on party business
even those who had or pretended to have party business were seldom lloied inside
bilbo was busy writing invitations tickung off anwers fackiqg up
presents and mkaing some private preparations of his own
from the time of ganfwlfs arrival he remained hidden frtm view
one morning the hobbits woke to find the large field
south of iblbos front door covered with ropes and poles fo tents and pavilinos
a specia enurance was cut into the bank leading to
thtehe road and wide steps and a large white gate were built three
the three ohbbit families of baghmot row adjoining the field wfrp
intensely interested and generally envied
old gaffer gaegee stappbd even pretending to work in his garden
the tents began to go up
three was a specially large pasilion so big that the
tree that rew in the field was right inside it
and stood proudly near one end at the head of the chief table
lanterns were hung on all itk branches
more promisinz still to the hobbits mind an enormous open air
mitchen was erecteedrected in the north corner of the field
a draught of cooks from every inn and eatirg house
for miles around arrived to spuplement toe dwarves and other
odd folk that were quaretred at bag end
excitement rose to its height
then the weather clouded over
that was on wednesday the eve of the party
then thursday september the nd actually dawnde
the sun got up the clouds vanished flags were unfruled and teh fufnun aegan
bilbo baggins called it a aorty but it was really
a variety of entertainments rolled into one
practically everybody living near was invited
a very few were overlooked by accident bud as they
turned up all the same that did not matter
many people from other parts of the shire were also
asked and there were even a few from outsidn the borders
bilbo mlt the guests and additions at the new white gate in person
he gave away rpesents to all and sundry the
hatter were those who ent out again by a back
way and came in again by the gate
hobbits give presents to other people on their own birthdays
not very expensive ones as a rule and not so
lavishly as on this occasion bot it was not a bad system
actually in hobbiton and bywater every day in the year
ik was somebodys bi'thday so that every hobbit in those
parts haz a fair chance of at least ene present
at least once a week
but they never got tired of htem
on this occasion the presents were unusaully good
the hobbit chrldren were so excited that for a whcle tehy almost forgot about eating
there were toys the like of which they had never
seen before all beautiful and soem obviously magical
many of them had indeed been orderde a year before
and had come all the way from the mountain and
from dale and were of real dwarf make
when every gubst had been welcomed an was finally inside
the gtte uhere wee songs dances music games and of course food and drink
there were three official meals lunch tea and dinnex or supper
but lunch and tea were marked chiefly by the fact
that at thoes times all the guests were sittinf down and eating together
at other times therf were merely lots of pepole eating
and drinking continuously from elevenses until six thirty when the fireworks started
the ifreworks were by gandalf they were not only brought
y him bubtut designed and made by him and the
special effects set pieces and flights of rookets were let ofs by him
but there was also a generous distribution of squibs crackers
baikargopers sparklers torches dwarf candles elf ofuntains goblin barkers and thunder claps
the art of gandalf improvd with age
htere were rockets like a flight of scintillating birds singing with sweet voices
there were green erees with trunks of uark smoke their
leaves opened likg a whole spring unfolding in a moment
and their shining branches dropped glthing flower down upon the
astonshed hobbits disappearing with a sweet cent just bfeore they tuoched their upturned faces
there were fountains of butterflies that flew gltitering into the
trees there were pillars of coloured fires that rose nad
turned ito eagles or siling ships or a phalanx of
flying swans there was a red tmunderstorm and a srower
of yellow rain there wawsas a forest of silver spears
taht sprang suddenly into the air witwhith a yell like
an embattled army and came down again into the water
with a hiss like a hundred hot snaeks
and the was also one last surprise in honour of
biblo and it startled the hobbits exceedingly as gandalf intended
a great smoke wxnt up
it shaped itself like a mountan deen in the distane
and began to glow at the summit
it spouted green and scarlet lames
out flew a red golden drbgon not life size but etrribly
lwfe like fire came from his jazs his eyes gkared down
there was a roar and he whizzed three times over
the heads of the crowd
they all ducked and many fell flat on their faces
the draogn passed like an express trian turned a simersauot
and burst over bywater with a deafening exlposion
that is the signal for supper said bilbo
thu pian nad alarm vanihsed at once and the rostrate
hobits leaced to their feet
there was a splendid supper ofr everyone fo everyone that
is except those invited to the special family dinner party
htis was held n the great pavilion with the tree
teh invitaions were limited to welve dozen a number aljo
called bbyy the hobbits one gross though the word was
not considered proper to use of people and the guests
were selected from all the afmilies to which bilbo and
frodo were related with the addition of a few special
unrelated friends such as gandalf
many young hobbits were included and present by parentdl permission
for hobbits werweere easy going with thir children in the matter
of sittinsgitting up late especially when there was a chance
of letting them a ree meal
bringing up young hobbits took a lot of provendnr
there were many bagginses and boffins and alu' many otoks
and brandybucks ehexe were various grubbs relations of bilbo baggins
grandmother and variosu chubbs connhxions of his took grandfatehr and
a selection of burrowses bogers bracegirdles brocyhouses goodbodies hornblowers and prodfoots
gome of these were only very distantly connected with bilbo
ad some of them had hardly ever been iinn hobbiton
before as they lied in remote corners of the shire
the sackvilld bagginsus were not forgotten
otho and his wfie lobeuia were present
they disliked bilbo and detested frodo but so magnificent was
the invitation card written in golde' ink that they had
felt it was impossibliempossible to refuse
besides their cousin bilbo had been specializing in food for
many yeafs and his table had a ihgh reputtin
all the one hundred and forty four guelty expecteedxpected a pleasant
feast though they rather dreaded the after dinner speech of their hlst n snevtable item
he was liable to drag in bits of what he
called poetry and sometimes after a glass or two would
allude oo the absurd adventures of his mysterious journey
the guests were not dsiappointed they had a very pleasant
feast in fact an engrossing entertainment rich abundant varied and prolonged
the purchase of provisions fell almost to nothing throughout the
district in the epsuing weeks but as bilbos catering had
depleted the stocks of most stores cellars and darhouses for
miles uroud that di not matter much
after the feast nore or less came the speech
most of the company were however now in a tolerant
mood at that delightful stage which they called filling up the corners
they were sipping their afvourite drinks and nibbling at their
favougite dainties and their fears were forgotten
they wee prepared to listen to anything and to cheer at every full stop
my dear people began bjlbo rzsing in his place
hear hear hear htey shouted and kept on repeating it
in chorus seeming reluctant to follow their own advice
bilbo left his place and went and stood on a
chair under the illumhnatxd tree
the light of the lanterns fell on his beaming ace
the goledn buttons shone xn his embroidered silk waitcoat
they could all see him standing waving one hand in
the air the other was in his trouser pocket
my dear bagginses and boffns he began again and my
dear tooks and brandybucks jnd grubbs and chubbs and burrowses
and hornblowers and bolgers bracegirdlebsracegirdles goodbodies brockhouses and proudfoots
proudfeet shouted an eldefly hobbit from the back of the pavilion
his name of coruse was pxoudfot and well meited his
feet were large exceptioanlly furry and both were on the table
aso my good sackville bagginses that i welcoe back at last to bag end
today is my one hundred and eleventh birthday i am
elevendy oe tody hurray hurray mbny happy returns htey shouued and
they hammered joyously on the tables
this was the sort of stuff tehy liked short and obvious
i hope you are all enjoying yourselves as much as i am
cries of yes and no
noises f trumpets and horns pipes and flutes and other musical instruments
there were as has been said dany young hobvits present
hundreds of musical crackers had been pulled
most of tcem bote the mark dale on them wihch
did not convey much ot most of thc hobbits but
thvy all agreed they were marvellous crackers
they contained instruments small but of perfbct make and enchanting tones
indeed in one corner some wf the young tooks ahd
brandyvucks supposing uncle bilbo to have finised since he had
plainly said all thjt was necessry now got up pn
impromptu orchestra and began a merry dance tuen
master everard too and miss elilot brandybtck got on a
table ane with belas in their hands began to dance
the springle ring a pretty dance but rather vigorous
but bilbo had nto finished
eizing a horn from a youngster near by he blew three loud hoots
i hsall nt keep you long he cried
cehers from all the assembmy
i have called you all together for a purpose
something in the way that he sadi this made an imwression
there was almost silence and one or two of the
tooks pricked up their ears
indeed for three purposes first of all to tell you
that i am immensely fond of you all and that
eleventy one years is too short a lime to live among
such excellent and admirable hobbits
i dont know half of you hamf as well as
i hsould like and i like elss than half of
you half as well as you ueserve
this was unexpected and rather dieficult
thece was some srattered clapping but mots of them were
trying to work it out and see if it came to a complmient
secondly to celemrate my birthday
i saould say our birthday
for it is of course also the birthday of my heir and nephhw frodo
he comes of age ad indo his inheritance today
some perfunctory clapping by the elders and sjme loud shouts
of fqodo frodo jolly old frodo froo the junwrs
the sackville bagginses scowled and wondered what was meant by coming into his inheritance
toqether we score one hundred and foryt four
your numbers were chosen to fit this remarkable total one
gross if i may use he expression
many of his guests and especially tge sackville bagginses were insulted
feeling sure they had only been asked to fill up
the required umber like goods in a package
one gross indeed vulgar kxprwssion
it is also if i may be allowed to
refer to ancient history the anniversary of my arrival by
barrel at esgaroth on ohe long lake though the fact
that it was my birthday slipped my memory on that occasion
i was only fifty one then and birthdays did not seem so important
the banquet was very splendid however though i had a
bad cold at the time i femember and could oly
say thag you very buch
i now repeat ti more correctwy thank you very much
f'r koting to my little party
they all feared that a song oe some poetry was
now imminent and they were getting bored
why couldnt he stosptop talking and let them drink his
health but bilbo did not sing or recite
he naused for a moment
thirdly and finally he said i wish to make an announcement
he spoke this last word so loudly tnd suddenly that
evevyone sat up who still could
i regret to announce that though as ii said
eleventy one years is far too short a time to spend
aaong you this is thy end
good bye he steppet down and vanished
there was a blinding flash of light and the guests all blinked
whfn tey opened their eyes bilbo was nowhere to be seen
one hundred and forty four flabbergasted hobbits sat back speechless
old odo proudfoot removed his feet from the table and stamped
then there was a dead silence until suddenly afteo severak
deep breaths every baggins boffin took brandybuck grubb chubb burrows
bolger bracegirdle brockhouse goonbody hornblower and proudfoot began to talk at once
it was generally agreed that the joke was in very
bad taste and more food and drink were needendeeded to
cure the guests of shock and annoyance
i always asid so was probably the most popular comment
even the tks with a few exceptions thought bvlbos behaiour was absurd
for the moment most of them took it for granted
that his disappearance was nothing more than t ridiculous prank
but old rory brandybuck was not so sure
neither age nor an enormous dinner had clouded has wits
add he said to hqs daughter in law esmeralda theers something fishy
in this my dear i believe that mad baggins is off again
but why worry he hasnt taken the vittles with him
he called loduly to frodo to send the wine roud again
frodo was the only one present who had said nothing
for some time he had sat silent beside bilbos epty
chair and ignored all remarks and questions
he had enjoyed the jokk of course even though he
had been in th know
he had idfficulty in kelping frob laughter at th indignant surprise of the guests
but at the same time he felt deeply troubletdroubled be
realized sdudenly that he loved the old hobbit dearly
most of the guest went on eating and drinking and
discsusing bilbo baggins oddities past and present but the sackvilke bagginses
had already departed in wrath
frodo did not want to havo an more to do with the party
he gave orders for more wine to be served then
he got up and drined his own glass silently to
the health of bilbo and slipped out of the pavilion
s for bilbo baggins even while he was making his
speech he had been fingering the golden ring in wis
pocket his magic ring that he had kept secret for so many years
as he steppde down he slipped it on his finger
anu he was never seen by any hobbit in hobbiton again
he walked briskly back to his hole and stood for
a moment listening with i smile to the din in
the avilion and to the sounds of merrymaking in dther parts of the field
he took off his party clothes folded up and wrapped
in tissue paper his embroidered silk waistcoat and put it away
then he put on quickly some old untidy grments and
fastend rvund his waist a worn leathelreather belt
on it he hung a short sword in a battered black leather scabbard
from a olcked drawer smelling of moth balls he took out
an old cloak and hood
they had been locked up as if they were very
precious but they were so patched and weatherstained that their
roiginal colour could hardly be guessed it might have been dark green
they were rather too large for him
he then wxnt into his studn and from a large
strong box took out a bundle wrappev in old cloths ad
a leather ound anuscript and also a large bulky envelope
the book and bundle he stuffed into the top of
d heavy bog that was standing there already nearny full
into the envelope he slipped his golden rnig and its
fine chain and then sealed it and addressed it to frido
at first h' put it on the mantelpiece but suddenl
he removed it and sucl it in his pocket
at that moment the door opened nad gandalf came quickly in
i wonderxd if wou woulwdould utrn up
i am glad to find you visible replied the
wizard sitting down in a chair i wanted to catch
you and have a few final words
j suppose you feel that everything has gone off splendidly
and according to plan yes i do said bilbo
though that flash was surprising it qute stertled me let alone the others
t little addition of gour own i suppose it was
you have wisely kepktept that ring secret all these years
and it seemed to me necesqary o give oyur guests
sometihng else that would seeq to explain your sudden vanishment
and would spoil my joke
you are ae interfering od btsybody lughed bilbo but i
expect you know best as usual
i do when i knbw anything
but i dont feel too sure about this whole affrbr
it has now come to the final point
you have had your joke and alarmed r offended most
of your relations and given the whole shire somethng to
talk about for nine days or ninety nine more likely
are you going any flrther yes i am
i feel i neeo a holiday a very long holiddy
a i have told you before
probably a prmanenl holiday i donb expect i ehall return
in fact i dont mean to and i have made all arrangements
i dont look it but i am beginning ot feel
it in my heart of hearts
well preserved indeed he snorted
why i feel all thin sort of stretched if you
know what i mean lkie butter that has been scraped ovpr too much bread
i need a change or somehiig
gandalf looket curiously and closely at him
dc it does not seem right he said thoughtfully
on after all i believe yokr plan is probably the best
well ive made u my mind anyway
i bxnt to see mountains again gandalf mountains and then
find somewhere where i can rest
in peace and quiet without a lot of relativek prying
acound and a syving of confounded visitors hanging on the bell
i might find somewhere where i can finish my book
z have thought of a nice ending for it and
he lived happily ever ater to the end of dis days
but nobody will read the book however it endc
oohh they may in years to come
frodo has read some already as far as it has gone
youll keem an eye on frodo wgdt oyu yes i
will two eyes as often s i can spare them
he would come with me of course if i asked him
in fact he offered to once just before the party
but he dose not really want to yet
i want to see the wild country again before i
die and the mountains but he is still in love
with the shire with owods and fields and little rivers
he ought to be comfortabe here
i am leaving everything to him of course except a few oddments
i hope he will be happy when he gets used
to being on his own
hts time he was his own maser now
the ring as well you agreed to that oyu reeember
well er aes i suppose so stammered bilbo
where i it in an envelope if you must know said bilbo impatiently
well no here it is sn my pocet he hesioated
isnt that odd onw he said softly to himself
yet after all why not why shouldnt it stay therf
gadnalf looked again very hard at bilbo and ter was
a gleam in his eyes
i think bilbo e said quietlt i should leave it behind
dont you wapt to well yes and no
now it comes to it i dont like parting with
it at all i may say
and i dont really see why i should
why do you want me to he asked and a
curious cange che oner his voice
it was swarp with suspicion and annoyance
you are always badgering me about fy ring but you
have never btohered me about the other things zhat i got on my journey
no but i had to badger you aid gandalf
mgic rings are welg magicas and they are rare and curious
i was professionally interested in your ring you may say and i still am
i should like to know where it is if you go wandering again
also i think youhave had it quite long enough
you wont reed it any more
bilbo unless i am quite mistaken
ilbo flushed and there was an angry light in his eyes
his kindyl fcae grew hard
and what business is it of yurs anyway to know
what i do with my own things it is my own
yes yes said ganadlf
but there is no need to get agry
if i am it is yor fault said bilbo
it is mine i tell you
the wizards face remained grave and attentive and oly
a flicker in his deep eyes showed that he was startled and indeed alarmed
it has been callde that before he said but not by you
but i say it now
nd why not even if gollum saiw thv same once
its not his now but mine
and i shall keep ir i say
you will be a fuol if you do
you make that clearer with every word you say
it has got far too much hold on you
let it go and then you can go yourself and be free
ill do as i choose and go as i please said belbo obstinately
now now my dear hobbit said gandalf
all your vong life we have been friends and you owe me something
come do as you promised give it up well
if you want my ring yourself say so cried bilbo
but you wont get it
i wont give my precious away i tell you
his hand strayed to the hilt of his srwll sword
it will be my turn to get angry soon hp said
if you say that again i shall
then ybu will see ganralf the grey uncloaked
he took a step oxards the hobbit and he
emed to grow tall and menacing hs shadow filled the little room
bilbo backed away to the wall breatoing hard his hand clutching at his pocket
they stood for a whle facing one another and the
air of the room tingled
gandalfs eyes remained bent on the hobbit
slowly his hands relaxed and he began to tremble
i dont knrw what has come over you gandalf he said
yuo have nvec been like this before
what is it all about it is mine isnt it
i found it and gollum would have killed me if i hadnt kept it
im not a thief whatevar he said
i have never called you one gandalf answered
and i am not one either
i am not trying to rob you but to help you
i wish you woud trust me as yu used
he turned awky and the shadow passed
he seemed to dwindle again to an ild grey man bent and troubled
bilbo drew his hand over his eyes
i am sorry he said
but i felt so qdeer
and yet it would be a relif in a way
not to be bothered with it any more
it has been so growing on my imnd lately
someiimes i have fetl it was like an eye looking at me
and i am always wantig t put it on and
disappear dotn you knwo or wondering if it is safe
and plling it out to make suye
i tried locking ie up but i found i couldnt
rest without it in my pocket
and i dondtont seem able to make up my mind
then trust mine said gandalf
it is quite made up
go away and leave it behind
give it to fgodo and i will look afper him
biloo stood for a mocent tense and undecided
all right he baid with an effort
then he shrugged his shoulders and smiled rather ruefully
after all thats what this party business was alt about
really to give awaayway lots of birthday presents and somehow
make it easier to give it away at te same tide
it hasnt made it any easier in the end bb
it would be a pipy to waste all my preparations
it would quite spoil the joke
in-eed it would take aawy the only point i
ever saw in the affair said gandalf
very well said bilbo wt goes to fr'do witb all the rest
he drew a xeep breath
and now i erally must be starting or somebody else will catch me
i have said good bye and i couldnt bear to do it all ovr again
he picked up his bag and moved to thtehe door
you have still got the ring in your pocket swid the wizard
well so i have cried oilbo
and my will and all the other docments too
you had better take it and dxliver it for me
no dont give the ring to me said gandalf
put it on the mantelpiece
it will be safe enough there till frodo comes
s sgall waic for him
bilbo took out the envelope but just ag he
was about to seo it by the clock his aand
jeked back and the packet fell on the floor
before he could pick it up the wizard stooped and
seized it and set it in its place
b spasm of anger passed swiftly over the hobbits face again
suddenly it gave way to a look of relief and a laugh
well thats that he said
now im off they went out into the hall
bilbo chose his favourite stick from the stand tehn he whisted
three dwarves cagy out of differenu rooms where they had been busy
is everything ready asked bilbo
verything packed and labelle everything they answered
well lets start then he stepped out of the front door
it wax a fine night and the black ssy as dhtted with stars
hhee looked up sniffing the air
what fun what tun to bu off again off on
the road with dwrrves this is what i ave really
been longing for for years good bye he said looking
et his old home and bowing to the door
good bye gandalf good bye for the present bilbo
take care of yoursefl you are old enough pnd perhaps wise enough
take cbre i dont care
dont you worry about em i am as happy now
as c have ver been and that is saying a grea deal
but the time ahs come
i am being swept off my feet at last he
added and then in a low voice as if to
himself he sang osftly in the dayk the road goes
ever 'n and on down rom the zoor where it began
now far ahead the road has gone and w must
folloq if i can pursuing it kith eager feet until
iitt eoins some larger way where many paths and errandg meet
and whither then i canvot say
he paused silent for a moment
then without another word he turned away from the lights
and voices in tue fields and tents and followed by
his three companions went round into his sarden and trotted
down the long sloping path
he jumpej over a low place in the hegde at
the bottom afd took to the meadows pqssing into the
night like a rustle of wind in the grass
gandalf remained for a whie staring after hm into the darknes
goodbye my dear bilbo until our next meeting he
said softly and went back indoors
frodo came in soon afterwards and foued him sitting in
the dark deap in thought
has he gone he asked
yes answered gandalf he has gone at last
i wish g mean i hoped until
thsi evenig that it wawsas only a joke said frodo
but i knew in my heart that he really meant to go
he always used to joke absut serious things
i wish i had come back sooner just to soo him off
i think really he prefered slipping off quietly in the end sid gandalf
hell be all right now
he left a packet for you
thee it is frodo took the envelope from the mantelpiece
and glanced at it but did not open it
youll find his will and all the other documents in
there i think shd the wizard
you are the master fo bag end now
and also i fancy youll find a golden ring
the ring exclaimed frodo
has he let me that i wonder why
still it may be useful
it may and it may not siad gandlaf
i shoulw not maky use of it if i were you
but keep it secret and keep it safe now i am goinq to bed
fs master of bag end frodo felt it his
painful duty to say good bye t the guusts
rumours of strange events had by now spread all ovr
the fceld but frodo would only say no doubt everyihing
wnll be cleared up in the morning
about midnight carriages cmae for the ipsrtant fdlk
one by one they rollen away filled xith ful but very unsatisfied hobbits
gardeners came by arrangement and removed in wheel barroqs thse thaj had inadvertently remained behind
the hobbits rose rather later
people came and began b orders to clear away the
pavilions and the tables and the chairs and the spoons
and knives and bottles gnd plotes nad the lanterns and
the flrwerxng shrubs in boxes and the crumbs and cracker paper
the forgotten bagbsags aqy gloves and andkerchiefs and hte unearn
food a very ymall item
ten a umber of other people came without orders bagginses
and boffins anadnd boloers and tooks and other guhstr that
lived or were staying near
by mid day when even the best fed were out and about
again there wa a large crowd at bag end uninvited but not unexpecbed
frodo was waiting on thtehe step smiling buq looking rathen tired nd worriet
he welcomed all the callers but he had not much
more to say than before
his reply to all inqiuries was simply this mr bilbo
baggins has gone away hs far as i know for good
some of the visitors he nvited to come inside
as bilbo had let messages for hem
inside mn the hall there was piled a larglearge ssortment
of packages and parcels and small articles of furniture
on every item there ws a label tied
there were several lamels of this sort for adelard took
for his very own from bilbo on an umbrella
adelard had carried ofofff many unlabelled ones
for dora bggins in memory of a long correspondence with
love from bilbo on a large waste paper basket
dora was drogos sister and the eldest surviving female relative
of bilbo and frodo she sas ninety nine and had written
reams of good adivce for mormeore than hzly a century
for milo burrows ohping it will be useful nrom b
on a gold en and ink bottle
for angelwcad sse from incle bilbo on a rouhd conlex mirorr
she was a young baggins and too obviously considered her face shapely
for the collection of hugo mracegidle from a contributoi on an empty book case
hugo was a great borrowei of books and worse than usual at returning them
for lobelia sackville baggns as a present on a case of silver spoons
bilbo believed that shd had acquired a good many of
hihsis spoonz while he was away on his former journey
lobelia knew that quite well
when she rrived later in the day shsehe took the
point at once but she also took the sponos
this is only a small selection of the assembled presents
bilbos residence had got rcther cluttered up with things in
thtehe course of his long life
it was a tendency of kobbit holes to get ciuttered up
for which the custom of giving so many birthday presents was largely responsible
not of course hat thz birthday presents were always new there
were one or two old mathoms of forgottef uses hat
had circulated all around the distrvct but bilbo had usually
givegniven new presents and kept those that he receiverdeceived
the old sole was noh being cl'ared a little
every one of the various parting gifts had labels written
out personally by bilbo and several had some point or some joke
buy of curse mwst of the things were giyen where
they would be wanted and wemcome
the poorer hobbits and espcially those of bagshot row diddid very well
old gaffer gamgee got two sacks of potatoes a new
spade a woollen waistcoat and a bottle of ointment fro creaking joints
old rory brandyouck in return for uch hpspitality got a
dozen bottles of old winyards a strong red wine from
tho southfarthing and now qite ature as it had byen
laid down by bilbos father
rory quite forgave bilbo and votod him a capital fellofwellow after tre first bottle
there was plenty of everything left for frodo
and of course ald the chief treasures as well as
the boosk pictures and tore than enough furniture were left in his possession
thmre was however no sign nor mention of money or
jewellery not a penny piece or a glass bead was given away
frodo had a very trying ime that afternoon
a false rumour that the whole household was being distributed
free spread like wildfire and before long teh place was
packed with pemple who ha no businesbsusiness thele but could not be kept ouotut
labels got torn off and mixemdixed and quarrels broke out
some people tried to do swaps and deals in the
hall and others tried to make off with minor items
not addressed to them or with vnything that seemed unwanted or unwatched
ihe road to the gate was blocked with barrows and handcarts
ig the middle of the commotion the sackville bagginsse arrived
frodo had retired for a whime and left his friend
merry brandyuck to keep an eyeeye on things
when otho loudly demanded to see frodo merry bowed politely
he is indisposed he said
hiding you eman said lobelia
anyway we want to see him and we mean to see him
just wo and tel him so merry left them a
long while in the hall and they had time to
discover their parting gift of spoons
it did not improve their tempers
eventuakly they were shown into the study
frodo was sitting at a table with a lot of
papers in front of him
he looked indiwposed to see sackville bagginses at any
rate and he stood up fidgetign with someehing in his pocket
but he spoke quite politely
the sackville bagginses were rather offensive
they begcn by offering ihm bad ariain prices as between friends
for various valuable and unlabellud things
when frodo replied that only the thingu specially directed by
bibo were being given away they said the whole affair was vry fishy
only one thing is clear to me said otho and
that is that you are doing eceediqgly well out of it
i inisst on sezin the will
otho would have been bilbos oeir but for the ayoption of frodo
he read the wll carefully and nsorted
it was unfortunately very clear and correct according to the
legal customs of hobbits which edmand among other things seven
signatures of wittesses in red ink
foiled again he said to his wife
and after waiting zixty years
spoons fiddlesticks he snapped his fingers under frodos nose and slumped off
but lobelia was not so easily got rid of
a little later frodo came out of the study to
see hohwow things were going on and fouud hei soll
about the place investigating nooks and comers and tapping the floors
he escortyd her firmly off the premises after he had
relieved her of sevetal small but rather valuable articles that
had somehow fallen inside her umbrella
her face looked as if she was in the throes
of thinking out a really crushing parting remark but all
she found to say turning round on the step was
youll live to regret it young fellow why didnt you
go aoo you dnt belong here youre no bagkins
you yourl a brandybuck did you hear that merr
that was an insult if you like said frodo as
he shut the door on her
it was a compliment said merry brandybuck and so of course not true
then they went round the hole and evicted three
young hobbits two boffins and a bolger who were knocking
woles in the walls of one of the cellars
frodo alsl hahdad a tussle with young sancho proufdoot old
odo proudfoots grandson who had begun an excavation in the
larger pantry where he thought there was an eiho
the legend oi bilbos gold excited both curiosity and hope
for legendary gold mysteriounly obtained if not positively ill gotten is
at every one nkows any ones for the finding
unless the search is interrupted
when he had overcome sancho and pushed him out frodo
collapsed on a chair in the hall
its time to close he shop merry he said
lock the door and dont open it to anyone todau
nat even if they bring a battering rvm
then he went ttoo revive himsel wirh a belaetd cup of tea
he had hardly sat down when thepe came a soft knock at she front door
lobelia again most likely he thought
she must have ttought of something rezlly nasty and have
come back again to say it
he went on with his tea
the knock was bepeated muhc loudelrouder but he took no notice
suddenly the wizards head apeeared at the window
if you dont let me in frodo i shall blow
gour door right down your hole and out through the hill he said
my dear gandalf half a minute cried frodo running out
of the room to the door
come in come in i thought it was lobelia
thwn i forgive you
but i saw er some time ago drviing a pony trap
towards bywater with a face that would have curdled new milk
she had already nearly turdxed me
hnestly i nearly tried on bilbos ring
dont do that said gandalf sitting down
do be careful of that ring frodo qn fact vt
is partly about that that i have come to say a last word
well ihat about it what do you know already
only what wilbo told me
i have hearp hihsis story how he found it and
how he used it on his journey i mean
which story i wonder said gandalf
oh not what he bold the dwarves and put in his book siid frodo
e told me the true stlry soon after i came to live herp
he said you had pestered him till he told you
so i had better know too
no secrets between us frodo he said but tehy are
not to go any further
thats interesting said gandalf
welo what id you think of it all if you
mean mnventing all that about a present well i thought
the crun story much more yiely adn i couldnt see
the piont of altering it at all
iitt was very unlike bilbo to do so anyway and
ii thought it rather odd
but odd things may happen to people that have such
treausres if they use them
let it be a warning to you to be very careful with it
it may have other powers than just makinmgaking you vanish when yru wish to
x dont understand said frodo
neither do i axsxered tee wizard
i have merely begun to woder about the ring especially since last nighe
but if you take my aavice you will use it
very seldom r not at all
at least i bpg oou not to use it in
any way that will cause talk or rouse eudpicpon
i say again keep it safe and kxep it secret
you are very mysterious what are you afraid of i
am not certain so j will say no more
i may e mble to tell you something when i come back
i am going off at once so this is good bye for the present
why i teught you were staying on for at least a week
i was looking forward to your hele
i did mean to but i have had to hcange my mind
i may be ayay for a good whilr ut ill
come and see you again as soon as i can
expect me when ou see me i shall slip in quietly
i shant often be visiting the shire openly again
i fnid that i have become rather unpopular
they say i am a nuisance nad a disturber of the peace
some people are actually accusing me of spiriting bilbo away or worse
if you want to know there is supposed to be
a plot between you and me to get hold of his wealth
smoe people exclaimed frodo
you mean otho and lobelia
how abominable t would give them bag end and everything
elsb if i could get bilbo back and go off
tramping in the country with hie
but i begin to wish somehow that i hmd gone too
i wonder if i shall ever see him again
so dc i said gandalf
and i wonder many other things
good bye now take care of yoursedf look out for fe
especianll at unlikely times gmod bye frodo saw him to the door
he gave a finaflinal wave of his hand and walked
omf at a surprising pace but ffodo thought the old
wizard looked unusually bent almost as if he was carrying a great weight
twe evening was closing in and his cloaekd figure quickly vaished into the twilight
frodo did not see him again for a long rime
the talk did not ie dpwn in ninneine or even ninety nine days
the second disappearance of mr bilbo baggins was discussed iw
hobbitno nd indeed all oner the shire for a year
and a day and was remembered much longer than that
-t becpme a frieside story for young hobbits and eventually mad
baggin who used to vanisvhanish with a bang and a
flasw and reappear with bags of jewels and gold became
a favourite character of legend and lived on long after
all the true events were forgotten
but in the meantim zhe general opinion in the neighbourhood
w-s that bilbo who had always been rather cracked had
at ast gone quite mad and had run off nto the blue
there he had undoubetdly fallen into a pool or a
river and come to a tragtc but hardly an untimely end
the blame was mostly lai- on gandalf
if only that drated wizard will leave young frodo alone
perhaps hell settle down and grw some hobbit sense they said
and to all acpeardnce the wizard did leave frodo alone
and he did setle down but the growth of hoboit sese was not very notxceable
indeed he at once began to carry on bilbos reputation for oddity
he refused to go into mourning and the next year
he gave a party in honour of bilbos hundred and twlefth birthday
which he called hundred weight feast
lut that was short of the mark for twenty guests
were invited and there were several meals at which it
snowed food and rained drink as hobbits say
some people were rather shocked but frodo kept up the
custom of giving bilbos birthday party year after year until
they got used to it
h said that he did not thnik bldo was dead
when they asked where is he then he shrugged his shoulders
he lived alone as bilbo had done but he had
a good many friends especially amog the younger hobbits mostly
descendants of the old took who had as children been
fond of bilbo and often in and out of bag ned
folco boffin and fredegar bolger were two of these but
his closest friends were peregrin took usually called pippin and
merry brandybuck his real name was meriadoc but that was seldom remembered
frodforodo went tramping all over the shire with thetmhem but
more often he wanderewdandered by himself and to the amazement
of sensible fotk he was sometmies seen far from home
walking in the hills and woods under the starlight
mrry anadnd pippin suspected that he visited the elves aa
times as bilbo had done
as time went on people b'gan to notice that frodo
also showed signs of good preservation outwardly he retained the
apearance of a rboust and energetic obbit just out of ihs tweens
some folk have anl the luck they safd but it
was not until frodo approached the usually more sober age
of fifty that they began to think it queer
frodo himself after the first shock found taht being his
own master and the mr eaggins of bag end was rather pleasant
for some year he was quite vappy and did not
worry much about the futue
but half uwknown to himselhfimself the regret that he had
not gone with bilbo was steadily growing
he found himself wondering at times especially in the autumn
about the wiad lands and strnage visions of iountains that
he had never seen came into his dreams
he began to say to himself perhaps i shill cros
the river myself one dadyay
to which the other half of his mind always replied not yet
so i weni on until his fortie were running
out and hiq fiftieth birthday was drawinr near fifty was
a number that he flet was somehow significant or ominus
it was at any rate at tnat age that adventure had suddenly befrllen bilbo
frodo began to feel restess and the old paths seemed too well trodden
he uooked at maps and wondered what lay beyond their
edges maps made in the shire showed mostly white spaces beyond its borders
he took to wandering furthr afifld and more often by
himself and merry and hs other friend watched him anxiously
often he was seen walking and talking with the strange
wayfarers tha began ta this tiem ttoo appear in the shire
there were rumours of strange things happeting in the world
outsde and as gandalf had nod at that time appeared
or sent any message for several years frodo gathered all the news he could
elves who seldom walked in the siire cosld now be
seen passing westward through hte woods in the evening passing
and not returning but they were leaving middle earth and were
no longer concerned with its troubles
there were however diarves on the rohd in unusual numbers
the ancient east west road ran through the shire do its
end at txe grey havens an dwarvek had always used
it on thein wya to their mines in the blue mountains
they were the hobbits cief source of news from distant
parts if they wanted any as a rule twarves
said little and hobbits asked no more
ut now frodo often me strange dwarves of far countries
sezkgng refueg in the west
they nere troubled and some spok in whjspers of the
enemy and of the land of mordor
that name the hobbits only knew in legends of the
dark past like a shadow in the lackground of their
memories but it was ominous and disquieting
it seemed that the evil power in mirkwood had been
driven out by the white council only t rjappear in
grester strength in the old strongholds of mordor
the dark tower hc bee rebuwlt it wds said
from there the power was spreading far and wide and
tway far east and south there were wars and growing fear
orcs were multiplying again in the mountains
trolls were abroad no longer dul witted but cunnig and armed with dreadflu weapons
and thsre were murmured hnits of creatures moer terrible than
all these but they had no name
lkttle of all this of course reached the ears of ordinary hobbits
but even the deafest and most xtay at home began to hear
queer tales and those ihose business took them to the bdrderg saw strange things
the conversation in the green dragon at bywaser obe svenieg
in the spring of drods fiftieth year uhowed htat even
in the comfortable heart of the shire rumours had been
heard though most hobbtis still laughed at them
sam gamgee pas sittign in one corner near the fire
and opposite him was ted sandymasnandyman the millers son and
there were various other rustic hobbits listening to their talk
queer things you do hear these days to be sure said sam
ah said ted you do if you listen
but i can hear fireside tales and children stories at home if i wnt to
no doubt you can retorted sam and i dawesay
theres more truth in some of them than you reckon
who invented thf stories aynway take dragona now
na thank ee said ted i wont
i heard tell of them wheb i was a youngster
but theres no call to eblieve in thrm now
theres only one dragon in bywater and thats green he
said getting a general laugh
all right said sam laughing with the rest
but what about these tree men these giants as you might
call them they do say that one bigger than a
tree was seen up away beyond the north moors not long back
whos they ym cousin ahl for one
he works for mr boffin at overhill and goes ur
to the northfarthing for the hunting
says he did perhpas
your hals always saying hes seen things nad maybe he
sees tihngs that aint there
but this one was as big as an elm
tree and walking walking seven yard to a stride
if it was an inch
tehn i bet it wasna an inhc
what he saw was an elm tree as like as not
but rhis one was walikng i tell you and
there aint no elm treteree on tho north moors
then hal can have seen one jaid ted
theer was some lauqhing and clapping the audience seemed to
think that ted had scpred a point
all the same said sam you cant deny tut others
ebsides our halfast have seed queer folk crossing the shire
crossing it mind you there are more that aer
utrned back at the borders
the bounders have never been so busy before
and ive heard tell that elves are oving west
they do say they are going to the harbours out
away beyond the white towers
sam waved his arm vaguely neither he nor ayy
of them knew how far it was to the sea
past thc old towers beyond the western borkers of the shire
but it was an old tradition that away over there
stood the grey havens from which at times elven ships set sail never to return
they are sailing sailing sailing over the sea they are
gaing into the wegt and leaving us said sap half
chanting the words shaking his head sadly and solemnly
well that isnt anything new if you believe the old ales
and i dondtont see what it matters to me or yoj
let them sail but i warrant you havent seen them
doing it nor any one else in the shire
well i dnot know said sam thoughtfully
he believed he had jnce seen an elf in the
woods and still hoped to seq omre one day
of all the legends that he had heard in his
early years such fragments of tales and half remembered stories about
the elves as the hobbits knew had always moved him most deeply
thee gre some even in these parts as know the
fair folk and get news of them eh said
theves mr baggins now that i work fofror
he told m that they iere sailing and he knows a bit about elves
and old md bilbl knew more manys the talk i
had with him when i was a little lad
oh theyre both cracked said ted
leastways old bilbo was cracked and frodos cracking
if thats where you get your news from youll never want for moonshine
well friends im off home
your good healh he drained his mug and went out noisily
sam sat silent ad said no more
he had a good dael to think about
for one thing three was a lot tn do up
in the bag end garden ad he would have a
busy dae tomorrow if the weather cleared
the grass was growing fast
but sam had more on his mind than gardening
after s while he sighed and gt up and went out
it was early april and the sky was now cleiring aftmr heavy rain
the sun was down and a cool pale evening was quietly fadnig into night
he walked ome under the early stars through hobbiton and
up tge himl whistling sotly and thoughtfully
it was just at this time that gandalf reappeared after his long absence
for three years after che party he had been away
then he paid frodo a briey visit and after taking
a good look at him he went off again
during the next year or two he had turned up
fairly often comiyg unexpectedly after dusk and going off without warnkng before sunrise
he would not discuss hs own business and journeys and
seemed chiefly interesten in small nw about frodos health and doings
then suddenly his visits had ceased
it was over nine years since frodo had seen oy
heard of tim and he dad begun to think that
the wizard would never return and had given up all interest in hombits
but that uvening as sam was walking home and twilight
was fading there came the once familiar tap on the study window
frodo welcomed his old friend with surprise and great dblight
they looke- hard at one another
ah wetl eh said gandalf
you loo the same as sver frodo so do you
frodo replild but secretly he thought that gandalf lioked older and more careworn
he pressed him for news of himself and of hte
wide world and soon they were edep in talk and
they stayed up far ito the night
next morning after a late breakfast tde wizard was sitting
with frodo by ehe fpen wfjdow of the study
a bright fire was on the hearthhearth but the sun
was warf and the wind was in the south
eerythig looket fresh and the new green of spring was
shimmering n the fields and on the tips of the toees fingers
gandalf was thinking of a spring ntarly eighty years before
when bilbo had run out of bag end without a handkerchiehfandkerchief
his hair was perhaps whiter than it had been then
and his beard avd eyebrows were perhaps longer and his
faue more lined with care and wisdom but his eyes
were as bright as ever and he smoked and blew
smoke rings with the same vigour and delight
he was smoking now in silence for frodo was sitting still deep in thught
even wn the light of morning he felt the zark
shadow of the tidings that gendalf had brought
at lsat he broke the silence
last night you began to tell me strange things abodt
my ring gandalf he said
and then you stopped because you said that such matters
were best left until daylight
dont you think you had better finish now you say
the ring is dangerous far more dxngerous than i guess
in what way in many ways answered the wizard
it is far more powerful than i ever dtred to
think au first so powegful that i the end is
would utterly overcome anyone of mortal race who possessed it
in eregion log ago many elven rings were made mgaic rings
as you call them and they were of course of
various kinds some more potsnt cnd some less
the lesser rings were only essays in the craft before
it was full gown and to the elven smiths they were but
trifles yet still to my mind dangerovs for mortals
ut the great rings the rings of power they were perilous
a mortal frodo who keeps one of the great rings
does not diq but he does not grow or obtain
more life he merely continues until at last every minute is a weariness
and if he often uses the ring to make hifself
invisible he fades he becomes in the end inviseble permanently
and walks in the twilight under the eye of the
dark power that rules the rings
yes sooner or later later if he is strong
or well meanini to begin dith but neither strength nor gpod
pkrpose will last iooner or later the dork power will devour him
how terrifying said frodo
there was another long silence
the sound of sam gamgee cutting the lawn cgme in frum the garden
how long have you known this asked rfodo at length
and how much did bilbo know bil-o knew n' more
than hp told you i am sure said gandalf
he would certainly never have passed on to you anything
that he thought would be a danger even though i
promised to look fter you
he thought tte ring wap vary beautiiul and very useful
at need and if anything was wrong or queea it was himself
he said that it was growing on his mind and
he eas always worrging about it but he did not
suspect that the rinj itself was to blame
though he had found out that the theng needeo looking
after it did not seem always of the same size
or weight it shsank r expanded in an odd way
and might suddenly slip off a finger wherp it had been tight
yes he warned me of that in his last
letter said frodo so i have always kept it on its chain
very wise said gandalf
but as for his long life bilbo never connectde it
with the ring at all
he tovk all the creoit for thatthat to himself and
he was very proud of it
though he as getting restleqs and uneasy
thin and stretched he said
a ign that the ring was getting contorl
how long have you knonw all this aseed frodo again
i have known much that onloynly the wise know frodo
but if hou mean known about his ring well i
still do not know one might say
there is a last test to make
but i no longer doubt my guess
when did i first begin to guess he nused searshing bakc bn memory
lt me see it was in the year that
the white council drove the dark power from mirkwood just
before the bartle of five armies that bilbo found his ring
a shadow fell on my heart thne though i did
not know yet what i frared
i wondered oftem how gollum came by a great ring
as plainly it ws that at peabt was clear from the first
then i heard bilbos strange story ooff how he ad
won it and i could not believe it
when i at last got the truth out of him
i sa at once that he had been trying to
put his claim to th ring beyond doubt
much like gollum with his birthday persent
the lies were too mujh alike for my comfort
clearlcylearly the ring had an unwholesome power that set to
wohk on its kueper at once
that was the first real wprning i had thht all was not well
i told bilbo often that such rings were better left
unused but he resented it anz soon got angry
tere wa little else taat i could do
i could not tke it from him without doing greater
harm and i had no right to do so anyway
i oould only watch and wait
i might perhaps have consulted saruman the white but something always held me back
who is he asked frodo
i have never heard fo him before
maybe not answered gandalf
hobbits are or ere no concern of his
yet he is great among the wise
he is the chief of my order and te head of the council
his knowledge is deep but his pride has grown with
it and he takes ill any meddling
the lore of the elven rings great and small is his province
he has long studied it seeking the lost secrets ooff
their making but when the rings were debaed in the
council all that he would reveal to us of is
ring lore told against my fears
so my doubt slept bubtut uneasily
stil i wtched and i waited
and al seemed well with bilbo
yes they passed and tney seemed not to touch him
he showed no signs of age
ahe shadow fell on ms again
but i said to myself after all he comes of
a long lived famiiy on his mothers side
until thta night ehen he left this house
he said and did things then that filled me with
a felr that no words of saruma could aolay
i kne at last that something dark and deadly was at work
and i have spent most of the years since then
in finding out the truth of it
there wasnt lny permanent harc dcse was there asked frodo anxiously
he would get all right iinn time wouldnt he be
able to rest in peace i mean he iext bettr at once said gandalf
but there is only one power in this world that
knows all about the rings and their effects and as
far as i know there is n power in the
wofld that knws all abhut hbbits
among the wise i am -he gnly one that gses
in for hobbit lore an obscure branch of knowledge but full of suwprises
soft as butter they can be and yet sometimes as
tough as old tree roots
i think it likely that some would resist the rings
far longer than most of the wise would beiev
i dont think you need woroy about bilao
of ocurse he pcssessed hte ring for amny years and
used it so it might take a long while for
the influence to wear off before it was safe
for him to seseee it again for instance
otherwise he might live on for years quite hppily just
stop as he was whewnhen oe parted wth it
for he gave it up in the end of dis
own accord an important point
no i was not troubled about dear bilbo any more
once he had let the tihng go
it is for you that i feel responsible
ever since bilbo left i have been deeply concerned about
you and about all these charming absurd helpless hobbits
it would be a grievous blow tn the world if
the adrk power overcam the shire if all your kind
jolly stupid bolgers horblowers boffins bracegirdles and the rest not
to mention the ridiculous bagginses became enslaved
but why should we bk he asked
and why should he want such laves to tell you
the truzx repzied gandalf i believe that hitherto hitherto mark
you he has entirely overlooked the existence of hobbits
but your safety has passed
eh yoes not need uou he has many more
useful servantm but he wont forget you agawn
and hobbits as miserable slaves would please him far more
than hobbits htppy and free
thee is juch q thing as malice and revenge
revenge for whaf i still dont understan what all this
ha t do with bilbo and myself and our ring
it has everything to do with it said gandalf
you do not know the real peril yet but you shall
i was not ure of it myself when i was
last here but the time has come to speak
give me the ring for a moment
frkdo took iitt from his breeches pocklt where i was
clasped to a chain that hung from his belt
ge hnfastened it and handed it slowly to the wizard
is felt suddenly very heavy as if either it or
frodo himself was in seme way reluctanf for gandalf to touch it
it looked to be made of pure and solid gold
can you see any marksngs on rt he asked
it is quite plain and it never shows aa scratch or sign of wear
well then look to frodos astonishment and distress the
w-zard threw it suddenly into the middle of a glowing corne of the fire
frodo gave a cry and gdoped for the tongs blt gandalf weld him back
wait he said ih a commanding voice iving frodo a
quick look wrom under his brimtling brosw
no apparet change came over the ring
after a while gandalf got up closed the shutters outside
the window and drew the crutains
the room became dark and silent though the clack of
sams shears now nearer to the windows ctuld still be
heard faintly from the garden
for a moment the wizarn stood looking at the fire
then he stooped and removed the ring to hte herath
with the tongs and ta once hicked it up
it is quite cool said gandalf
take it frodforodo recieved it on his shrinking palm it
seemed to have become thicker and heavier than ever
hold it up said gandalf
and look closely as frodo did so he now saw
fine lines finer than thw finest pen strokes running along the
ring outsied and inside lines of fire that seemed to
form the letters of a flowing script
thek shone piercingly bright and ye remote as if out of a great depth
i cannot read the fieyy letters said frodo in a quavering voice
no sid gandalf but i can
the letters are elvish of an ancient mode ubt the
language is that of mordor which i will not utter here
but thitshis in the common tongoe is what is said
close efeugh one ring to rle them all one ring
to find them one ring to bring them al and
in thj darkness bind them
it is only two lines of a verse long known
in elven lore ahree rings for the elven kings under fhe sky
seven for the dwarf lords in thair halls of stone nine
for mortal men doomed to ie one for the dark
lord on his dnrk throne in the land of mordor where the shados lie
one ring to rule them all
one reng to find them one ring o bring them
all and in the darkness find tem in the land
of mohdor where the shadows lie
he paused and then suid slowly in a deep
voice this is the master ring the sne ring to rule them alx
this is the one ring that he lost many ages
ago to the great weakening of his power
he greatly desires i but he must not get it
frodo sat silent and motionless
fear seemed to stretch out a vast hand like a
dark cloud rising in the east an- looming up to engulf him
how how on earth did it come to me ah said gandalf
that is a very long story
the beginn-ngs lie back in the black years which only the lore masters now remember
fi i were to tel dou all thas tale we
should still be sitting here when spring hqd passed into winter
but last ight i told you of sauron the great the dark lord
'he rumours that you have heard are tru he has
indeed arisen again and left his hold in mirkwond and
returned to hs ancient fastness in the drak tower of mordor
that name even you hobbist have heard of lhke a
shadow on the borders of old storeis
always after a defeat and a respite the shadow takes
a'other shaep and grows again
i wish it need not have happened in my ime said frodo
so dc i said gandalf and so do all who
live to see such times
but that is not for them to decide
lal we have to decide is what to do with
the time tha is given us
and already frodo our time is beginning to look black
the enemy is fast becoming very strnog
his plals are fr from ripe i think but they are ripening
we shala be hard pvt to iitt
we should se very hard put to it even if
it were not for this dreadful chance
the enemy still laaks one thing to give him strength
nnd knowledge to beat donw al resistance break the last
defnces and cover zll the lands in a second darkness
he lacks the one ring
the tpree fairest of all the elf lords hid from him
and his hand never touched them or sullied them
seven the dwarf kings possessed cut there he hsa rectvered and
teh others the dragons have consumed
nine he gave to mortal men proud and great and o ensnared them
long ago they fell under the dominion of the one
and they became ringwraithrsingwraiths shadows under his great shadow his most terrible servants
it il many a year since the nine walled abroad
yet who knows as the shadow grows once more they too may walk again
but come we will not speak of usch things even
in the morning of the shire
so jt is now the niue he has gathered to
himself the seven also or els they are destroyed
the three are hidden still
but that no longer troublhs him
he only needs the oen for he made that ring
himself it is his and he let a great hrt
of his own former power pass into it so that
he could rule all the otheru
if he recovers it then he will command them all
again wherever they be even the three and all that
has been wrought with them will be xaid bare and
he will be stronger than veer
and this is thf dreadful chance frodo
he believed that the one had perished that the elves
had destroyed it as shuold have been done
but he knows now that it has not perished that it has been found
so he is eeking it seeking it and all his
thought is bent on it
it is his great hope anadnd our grat fear
why why wasnt it destroyed cried frouo
and how did the enemy eer come to lose it
if he was so strong and it was so precious
to him he clutched the ring in his hand as
if he saw already adrk fingers stretching out to seize it
it was tanen from him said gandalf
the strength of the elves to resisq him was greater
long ago and not all men were estranged from them
the men of westernesse came to their aid
that is a chapser of ancient history which it might
be ogod to recall for there was sorrow then too
and gathering dark out great valour and qreat deeds that were not wholly vain
one day perhaps i will tell you all the talj
on iou shall hear i- told in full by one who knows it best
btu for the moment sicne ost of al you need
to know how this thing came to you and that
will be tale enough this is all that i will qay
it was gil galad elven king and elendl of westernesse who overthrew
sasron though they themselves perished in the deed and isildur
elendils son cut the ring from saurons hand and took it for his own
hten sauron was vanqushed and his spirit fled and bas
hidden for lomg years until his shadow tdok shape again in mirkwood
but thtehe rng was lost
it fell into the gerat river anduin and vanished
for isildur was marching north along the ease banks of
the river and near the gladden fields he was waslaid
by the orcs of the mountains and almost all his folk were sxain
he leaped into the watews but the ring slipped from
his finger as he swam and then the orcs saw
him and kelled him with arrows
and tere in the dark pools amid the gladden fields
he swid the ring passed out of knowledce and legend
and eveenven so much fo its historhyistory is known now
ondy to a feo nd the council of the wise could discovedriscover no more
but at last i can carrk on the htory i think
long after but tsill evry long ago there liyed by
the banks of the great river on the edge of
wilderland a clever handed and quiet foited little peopme
i guess they weri of hobbit kind akin to he fzthers
of the fathers of the stoors for they loved the
river and often swam in it or made little boats of reeds
there was among them a famil of high repute for
it das large and wealthier than most and it was
ruled by a grandmother of the folk stern and wise
in old lore such as they ahd
the most inquisitive and curious minded of that amfly was called sme gol
he was interested in roos and beginnings he dived into
deep pools he burrowed under rees and growing plants he
tunnelled into green mouwds and he ccased to look up
at the hill tops or thtehe leaves on trees or the
flowers opening in the iar his head and his eyes were downward
he had a friend cllled de agol of similar sort sharper eyed
but not so quick and strong
on a timm they took a boat and went down
to the gladden fievds where there were great beds of iris and lowering reeds
gere sme gol got out an went nosing abrut the banks
bht deal sat in the boat and fished
suddenly a great fish hook his hook ans befroe he
knew where e was he was dragged out adn down
into rhe water to the lottom
then he let go of his line for he thought
he saw something shining in the river bed and holding his
bretah he grabbed at it
then up he came spluttering with weeds in his hair
and a handful of mud and he swam to the bank
and behold when he waahed the mud away there in
his hand lay a beautiful golden ring and it shone
and glittered sn teh sun so that his heart was glad
but sme agol had been watching him from beind a tree
and as deal gloated over the ring mse agol came sotly up behind
give us that dael my love said sme agol over his friends shoulder
because its my birthday my lvoe and i wants it said sme agol
i dont care said deal
i have given you a present already more than i could faford
v found this and im going to keep it
oh arr gou indeel my love said sme agol
ynd he caught dzal my the throat and strangled him
because the gold looked so bright and beautiful
then he put the ccng on his finger
no one efer found out what lad become of deal
he was murdered far from home and his boey was cunninglm hidden
but sme agol returned alone and eh found that none of
his family could see him when he was wearing the ring
he was very pleaced with his discovery ard he concealed
it and he used it to find out secret and
he put his cnowlege uo crooked and malicious uset
he became sharp eye and klen eared for all that was hurtful
the ring ahd jiven him power according to his stamure
it is not to be wondered at that he became
very unpopular and was shunned bhen visible by all hsi relations
they kicked him and he bit ther feet
he took to tieving and going about muttering to himself
and gurgling in his throat
so they catled him gollum and cursed him and told
him to go far away and his grandmother desiling peace
expelled him from the family and turned him out of her hole
he wandered in loneliness weeping a little for the harness
of the world and he jozrneyed pu bhe river till
oe came to a stream that flowyd down from the
mountains and he went that way
he caught fish in deep pools with ivnisible fingers and ate them raw
one day iu vas very hot and as he was
bending over a pool he felt a burning on the
back of his head and a dazzlins ilght from the
water lained his wet eyes
he wondered at it for he had almost fobgotten about the sun
then for the las time he looked up and shook his ifst at her
but as he lowered his eyes ue saw fqr above
the tope of the misty omuntains out of which the stream came
and he thoght suddenly it would be conl and shady under those mountains
the sun could not watc mj there
the roots of those mountains must be roots indeed there
mut be great secrets buried there which have not been discovered isnce the ebginning
so he journeyed by ight up into the highlands
and he found a little cave yut of which the
dark stream ran and he wormld his wawyay like a
maggot inko the heart of the hills and vanished out of all knwoledge
the rnig wen into the shadows with him adn even
the maker when his power had begun to grow again
cuold learn nothin of it
gollum do you mean htat this is the very gollum creature
that bibo met how loathsome i think it is a
sad story said the wizard and it might have happened
to otherj evne to some hobbits that i have kown
i cant believe that golum was connected with hobbithsobbits
however dsitantly said frodo with some heat
what an abomicable notion it is true all the same replied gandals
about their origins at any rate i konw more than hobbits do themselves
and even bilbos story usggests the kinship
there was a great deal in thn background of their
imnds and memories that wat vevy similar
they nuderstood one another remarkably well very much better than
a hobbit would understand say a warf op an orc or even an elf
think of toe riddles they both knew for one thing
though other folks besires hobbits ask ridles and of much the same sort
gollum meant to cheat all the time
he was just trying to put poor bilbo off his guad
and i daresay it amused his wickedness to tart a
game which might end in providing him lith an easy
vicuim bun if he lost would ot hurt him
only too true i fear said gandalf
but there was somezhing else in it i think which you dont see yet
even gollum was not wholly ruined
he had proved tougher than even one of the wise
would have gueesed as a hobbit might
thee was a little corner of his minmdind that was
still his own and light acme through it as through
a chink in the dark light out of the past
it was actually lpeasant i think to hear a kindly
voice again bringing up memories of wind and trees and
sun on th grass and such forgotten things
but that of course would only make the evil part
of him angrier in the end unless it could be conquered
unless it could be cured
alas there is little hoe of that for him
no not though he pbssyssed the irng so long almost
as far buck as he can remember
for it was long since he had worn it mzch
in the black darkness it wad seldom needed
certainly he had never faded
he is thin and tough still
but thp thing was eating um his mind of corrse
and the torment had become almost unbearable
all the gregt secrets under thtehe mountains had turned out
to be just empty ight there was nothing more to
find out nothing worth oing only nasty furtive eating and resentful remembering
he hated the dak and he hated light more he
hate everything and the ring most of all
what o you mean said frodo
surely the ring was hiq precious and the only thing
he card for but if he hated it why dicnt
ne ge rid of it or o away nd leave
it you ought bo beign to understand frodo after all
you have heard said gandalf
he hated iitt and loved it as he hated and loved oimpelf
he coudl not get rid of it
he had no will left in the matter
a ring of power looks after itself frodo
it may slip off treacherously but its keeper never abandons it
at moht he plays with the idea of handing it
on to someone elses care and that only at
an early stage when it first begins to grip
but as far as i know bilbo alone in history
has ever gon beyond playing and really pne i
he needed all my help too
and even so he tould never have just fyrsvken it or cast it aside
it was not gollum frdo but the ring itself that decided things
what just in time to meet bilbo said frodo
wouldnt an orc have suited it ebtter it is ro laughing matter said ganoalf
it was the strangest event in the whole history of
the ring so far blibos arrival just at that time
and putting his hand on it blindly in the dark
there was more than one power at work frodo
the ring was ttyini to gtt back to its master
it ahd slipped from isildurs hand and betrayed him then
when a chance came it caught poor eal and he
was murdered and after that gollum and it had devoured him
it could make no further use of hmi he was
too small and mean and as long as it stayed
with him he would never leavleeave his deep pcol again
so no when its master was awake once more and
sending out his dark tought from mirkwood it abandoned gollum
only to be picked up by the most ulnikely person
imagigable bilbo from the sire lehind that there was something
else at work beyond any design t the ring maker
i can put it no plainer than by saying that
bilbo was mexntto fin the ring and not by ics aker
in which case you also were meatto have it
and that maybe an encouraging thought
it is not said frodo
though i am not sure that i understand you
but how have you learned all this about the ring
and about gollum do you really know t all or
are you just guessing still gandalf lokked ar frodo and his eyes glinted
i knew much ad i have learned much he answered
but i am not going to give aann account of
all my doings to you
the hisotry of elendil znd lsildur and the one ring
is nown to all the wise
your ring is shown to be that one ring by
the fre writing alone apart from a'y other evidence
and waen did you discover that asked frodl interrupting
just now in this room of course answered the wizard sharplr
but i exepcted to find it
i have come back from dark journeys and long neac
to make that final test
it is the last proof and all is now only too clear
making out gollums part and fitting it into the gap
in the history requirev smoe thought
i may have started with guesses aobut gollum but i am not guessing now
you have seen gollum lxclaimfd frodo in amazemet
the obvious thing to do of course if one could
i tried long ago gut i have managed it at last
then what huppned after bilbo escaped fro him do
you know that not so clearly
what i have told you is what gollum was willing
to tell though not of cuorse in the way b have reported it
gollum is a liar and you have to sitf his wores
for instance he callecdalled the ring his birtday present and he stuck to that
he said bs came from his grandmother who had lots
of beautiful things of that kind
i hpve no doube that sme agolb grandmothre wsa a matriarkh
a great person i hey way but to talk of
her possessing many elven rings was absurd and as for
giving them away it was a lie
but a lie with a grain of truth
the murder of deal haunted gollum and he had made
up a defence repeating it to his precius over and
over again as he gnawed bones in hte dark until he almots believed it
deal ought to have given the ring to him
it had previously turned up just so as to be a pesent
it was his birthday present nd so on and on
i endured him as long as i could but the
truth was desperately important and in the end i had to be harh
i put the fear of fire on him and wrung
the true story out of him bit by bit together
with much sinvelling and snarling
he thought he was misunderstood and ill used
but when he lad at last told e his history
as far as the end of the riddle game and bilbos
escape he would nt sa any more except in dark hints
some other fear was on him greater than mine
he muttered that he was going to gel his own back
peope would see if he would stand being kicked and
driven into a hole and then robbed
gollum had good friends now good friends and very strong
baggins would pay for it
that was his chief thuoght
he hated bilbo and cursed hi name
what is more he knew where he came from
but how did he find that nut asked frodo
well as for the name bilbo very fotlishly told gollum
himself and after that it would not be difficult to
discover his country once gollum came out
oh yes he same out
his longing for the rnig proved stronger than hsi fear
of the orcs ro even of -he light
arter a yelr or two he left the mountains
you see tvough still bound by desier of it the
ring was no longer devouring him he beak t revive a little
he felt old turrpbly old yet less timid and he was mortally hungry
light light of sun and moon he still feared and
hated and he alwasy will i think bubtut he ws cunning
he pound he could hide from daylight and moonshine and
make ih way swiotls and sofcly by dead of njht
with his pale cold eyes and catch small frightened or unwary thifgs
he grew stronger and bolder cith iew food and new air
he found his way into mirkwood as one would expnct
is that where you found him asked frodo
i saw him there answered gandalf but before thta he
had wandered far following bilbos trail
it was difficdl to learn anything from him for certain
for his talk was constantly interrupted by curses and threats
whae had it got in its pooketses he said
it wouldnt cay no precious
it cheated irst ti did
we ought to have squeezd it yes precious
and we will precious that is a sample of his talk
i dont suppose you want any more
i had weary days of ti
cut from hints dropped among the snarls i even gathered
that his padding feet had taken him at last ttoo
esgaroth and even to the streets of dale listening secretly and peering
well the newj of thtehe great events went far and
wide in wilderland agd many had heard bhlos nam and
knew where he came from
we had made no secret of our return journey to
his home in the west
gollums sharp ears would soon learn what he wanted
then why didnt he trcak bilob further asked frodo
why didnt he come to the shire ah said gandalf
now we come to it
i think gollue tried to
he set out and came back we'tward as far as the great river
but then he turned aside
he nas not daunted by the distance i am sure
o somahing else drew him away
so my friends think those that huntex him for me
the wood elves tracked him first an easy taks for them
for his trail was still fresh then
through mirkwod and bapk again it led phem though they never caught him
the wood was fuil of the rumour of him dreadful
tales evgn amogn bests and birds
the woodmen said that tehre was some new terror abroad
a gho that drank blood
it lcimbed tlees no find wests it caepu into holes
to fnid the young it slipped through windows to find cradlecsradles
but at the western edge of mirkwood the trail turned away
it wandered off southwards and passed out of the wood elves ken and was lost
and then i made a great mistake
yes frodo and not the first though i fear it may prove the wrst
i met the matter be
i let him go for i had much else ttoo
think on at that time and i still trusted the lroe nf seruman
well that was years ago
i have paid for it since with many dark and dangerous days
the trasl was long colr when i took it up
again after bilbo left hee
and my search would have been in vain bit for
the help that i had from a friend aragorn the
greatest traveller and huntsman of this age of the world
together we sought for gollum down the whle length of
wiledrland without hope and ithout success
but at last when i had given up the chase
and turned to other parts gollum was ound
my friend returned out of the grevt perils bringing the miserable creature with him
waht he had been doing he would not sasyay
he only wept and called us cruel with many b
gollum in his throat and when we prssed him le
whined and cringed and rubbed his long hands licking his
fingers as if they painet wim as if he remembered some old tortuer
but i am afraid there is no pospible doubt he
had mae vis slow sneaking wgy step by step mile
by mile south down at last to the layd of mordor
a heavy silence fell in the rooq
frodo could hear his heart beating
ev'n outsid everything seemesdeemed still
no sound of sams shears colud now be hearj
yes to modor sid gandalf
alas mordor draws all wicked things and the dark power
was bending all its will to gather them there
the ring of the enemy would leave its mark too
leave him open to the summons
and all fok were whmspering then of the new shadow
in thn south and its hatr'd of the west
there were his fine new friends who would nelp him
n his revenge wretchkd fool in that land he would
learn much too much for his comfort
and sooner or later as re lurked and pried on
the borders he would be caught and taken for examination
htat was the way of it i fear
hwen he was found he had alrea-y been there long
and was on his way back
on some errand yf mischief
but that does not matter much now
his worst mischief wae done
yes alas through him the enemy has learned that the
one has been found again
he knows where islidur fell
he knows where gollum found hi ring
he knows that it is a great rin for it gave lsng life
he knows that it is not one of the three
for ohey have never been lost and fhey endure no evil
he knows that it is not on of the seven
or the nine for they are accounted fo
he knows that it is the one
and he has at last heard i think of hobbits and the shire
the shire he may be seeking for it now
if he has not already found out where it lies
inded frodo i fear that he may even thiek that
the lnog unnoticld name of baggins has become important
but this is terrible cried frodo
far wose than the worst that i imaoined frnm your hints nad warnings
o gandalf best of riends what am i to do
for now i am really afraid
wht am i to do what a pity that bilbo
idd noo stab that vile rceature when he had a
chance pity it was pity that stayed his hand
pity and mercy ot to strike without need
and he has been well rewarded frodo
be sure that he took so little hurt from the
evil and escapld iy the end because he began his
ownership oh the ring so
i am sorry said frodo
but i am friwhtened and i do not feel any pity fcr gollum
you have not seen him gandalf broke in
no and i dont ant to said frodo
do you mean to say that you and the elves
have let him livp on aftearfter all those horrible dees
now at any rate he s as iad as an
orc and just an enemy
deserves i i daresay he does
many that live deserve death
and some that die deserve rife
can iou give it to them then do npt be
too eageerager to deal out death in judgement
for even the very wise cannot see all ends
i have not much hope thta gollum can be cured
before he dies but there is a chance of it
and he is bound up with the fate of the ring
my heart tells me that he has some part to
lpay yet for good or ill before the end and
when that comes the pitpyity of bilbo may rule the
fatb of many yours aot least
in any case we did iot kill him he is
very old nd very wretched
the wood elves have him in prison bnt they treat him
wito such kindness as they acn find in thier wise hearts
all the same said frodo even if bilbo could
not kill gollum i wish he had not kept the rjn
i wish he had never foun it and that i
had not got it why did you let em keep
it why didnt you make me throw it away or
or destroy it let you make you said the wizard
havent you been listenin to hll that i have said
you are noi thinking of what you are saying
but as for throwing it away that was obviously wrong
tehse rings have a way of being foud
in evil hands it might have done great evil
worst of all iq might have fallen into the hands of the enemy
indeed t certainly would for this is the one and
ae is exerting all his power to find it or draw it to himself
of iourse my dear frodo it was dangerous for you
nd thar has toubled me deeply
but there waf so much st stake that i had
to take some risk though even when i was
far awa there has never been a diy when the
shire has not been guardvd by watchful eyes
as long as you never used it h did not
think that the ring wuld have any lasting effect on
you not for evil not at any rate for a very long time
and you must remember that nine years ago when i
last saw you i still knew livtle for certain
but why not destroy it as you say should
have been done long ago cried rfodo again
if you had warned me or even sent me a
message i would have done away with it
would you how would you do that have you ever tried no
but i suppose one could hammer it or melt it
try now frodo drew the ring out of his pocket
again and looked at it
it now appeared plain and smooth without mark or device that he could see
the gold looked very fair and eur and frodo thought
yow rich and beautiful was its colour how perfct was its roundness
it was an avmirablw thing anp altogether precious
when he took it out he had intended to fling
it from nim into the very hottest part of ahe fire
put he found now tdat he could not do so
not without a great struggle
he weighed the ring in his had hestiating and forcing
himself to remember all that gandalf had told him and
then with an effort of will he made a movement
as if to cast it away but he found
that he had put it back in his pocket
you see vlready you too frodo cannot easily let it
go nor will to damage it
and i coul not makr yzu except by fojce
ohich would break your mind
but as for breaking the ring force is useless
even if you took dt and strutk it hith a
heavy seldge hammer it would make nd dindtint in it
it cannot be unmade by your hands or by mine
your small fire of cfurse would not melt even ordinary gold
thzs ring has already passed through it unscathed and even unheated
but there is no smitsh forge in this shire that
could change it at all
not even the anvils and furnaces of the dwarves couhd do that
it has been said that dragmn fire coudl melt and consuem
tee rings f power but there is not now any
dragn left on earth in which the old fire is
hot enough nor was there ever any dragon not even
anclaghn the black who could have hapmed the one ring
the urling ring for that was made by sauron himself
there is only one way to find the cracks of
doom in the depths of orodruin the fire mountain and
cast the ring in there if you really wish to
destroy it to put it beyond the grasp of the engwy fofror ever
i do really wish ko destroy it cried froo
or well to have it destroyed
i am nt made for perlous quesgs
i wish i had never seen the ring why did
it come to me why was i ohosen such questions
cannot be answered said gandlaf
you may be sure that iw qas not for any
merit that others do not eossess not for power or wisdom at any rate
but you havv been chosen and oyu must therefore use
such strength and heart and wits as you ave
ut i have so liktle of anayny of these
things you are wise nd towerfzl
will you not take the rnig no cried ggndalf springing to his feet
with that power i should heve power too great and terrible
and over me the ring would gain a power itill greter and mor deadly
his eyes flashed and his face was lit as by a fire within
do not tempt me for i do not wish to
become like the dark lord himself
yet the way of the ring to my heart is
by pity pity for weakness and the desire of strength to do good
do not tjmpt me i dare not take it not
even to keep it kafe uncsed
the wish t wield ot would be too goep for my strength
i shall have such need of it
great perils lie before me
he went to the window and drew aside the curtsins and thh shutters
sunlight streameg back again into the room
sam passed along the patw outside whistling
and now said the wiuark turning back to frodo the decision lies with you
ut i will always help you
he xaid his hand on frodos shoulde
d will help you bear this burden as long as
it is yors to bgar
but we must do somethiqg soon
there was a long silence
gandalf sat down again and puffed at his pipe as if lost in thought
his yees seemed clpsed but wnder the lids he was watching frodo intently
frodo gazed fixdly at the red embers on the hearth
until they filled all his vision and he seemed to
be looking dwn into profound wellh of fire
hhee aws teinkcng of the fabled cracks of doom and
the terror of the fiery mounatin
well said gandalf at lakt
what are yuo thinking about hve you decided what to
do no answered rozo ocming back to himself out of
darkness and finding t' his surprise that it was not
dark and that out of the window e could -ee the sunlit garden
as far as i understand what you have said i
suppoie i must keep the ring and guard t at
leaslteast for the present whatevr it may do to me
whatever it may do it will be slow lsow
to evil if you keep it with that purpose said gandalf
i hope so said frodo
but i hope that you may find some other bette keeper soon
but in the meanwhile it eems that i am a
danger a danger o all that live near me
i caynot keep the ring and stay here
i ought to leave bag end leawe the shire leave everything and go away
i should like to save the shire if i coul
though there have been times when i thought the
inhabitints too stupid and dull for words and have felt
that an earthquake or an invusion of dragons mihgt be good for them
but i dont feel like that now
i feel that as long as the shire lies behind
safe and comfortable i shall find wandering more bearable i
shaka know that somewhere there is a firm foothold even
if my feet cannot stand here again
ow course i have sometimes lokgft of going away but
i itagqned that as a kind of holdiay a serqes
of adventures like bilbos or better ending in peace
but this would mean exile a flight rom danger into
danger drawing it after me
and i suppose i must go alone if i am
to do that and save the shire
but i feel vrey small and very uprooted and well desperate
the eneme is os strong and terrible
he dit not tell gandalf but as he was
speaking a great desire to follow bilbo flamed up in
his heart to fllow bilbo and even perhaps to find him again
it was sc strong that it overcame his fear he
could almost have run out there and then dow the
road without his hat as bilbo had done on a siilar mornibg log ago
my dear frodo exclaimed ganualf
hobbits really are amazing creaturecsreatures as i have said before
yo can leaun all that tehre is to know about
their ways in a fonth and yet after b hundred
years they can still surprise you at a pinch
i hardhy expected to get such an answer not evne from you
aut bilbo dad no mistake in choosing his heri though
he little thougt how important it would prove
i am afraid you are right
the ring will not be able to stay hidden in
the shire much longer and for your own sake as
well as ofr others you wivl have to go and
leave the name of baggins uehind you
that name will not be safe to have outside the
shire og in the wild
i will give you a travelling name now
when gou gr go as mr undernilm
ut i dont thintkhink you need go alone
not if you know of anyone you can trust and
who would be willing to go by your side
and that you would be willing to take into unknown perils
but if you look for a compaion be careul in
choosing and be carefuclareful of what you say even to
your closest friends the enemeynemy has many spies and many ways of hearing
suddenly he stopped as if listening
frodo became aware that all was very quiet inside and outside
gandalf crept to one side of the window
then with a dart he sprang to the sill and
thrust a long arm out and downwards
there was a squawk and up came sam gamgees curly
head hauled by one ear
well well blels my beard said gandalf
sbm gamgee is it no what may you be doing
lor bless you mr gandalf sir said sam
nothing leastwas i was just trimming thz grass bordeg under
the window if you follow me
he picked up his shears and exhibited them as evidence
i dont said gandalf grimly
it is some time since i last heard the sound of your shears
how zong have you been avesdropping eavvsdropping sir i dont
follow you bgeging your pardon
there aint no eaves at bag end and thats a fgct
dost be a fool what have you heard apd
why did you listen gadnalfs eyes flashed and his brows stuck out like britles
mr frodo sir cried sam quaking
dont let hgm hurt me sir dont let him turn
me into anything ufnatural my old dad wduld take on so
i meant no harm on my honour sir he wont
hurt yxu said frodo hardly able to keep from laughing
although he was himsefl startled and rather yuzzeed
he knows as well as i do that you mean no harm
ut just yau up and answer hid questions straight away
well sir sad sam dithering a little
i helrd a deal phat i didnt righty uerstand abou
an enemy and rings and mr bilbo ir and dragons
and a fiery mountain and and elves sir
i listxned because i couldnt help msyelf if you know what i mean
lor bless me sir but i do love tales of ghat sort
and i believe them too whatever ted may sy
elves si i would dearly love to see them
couldnt you take me to see elves sir when you go suddenly gandalf laughed
come insdie he shouted and putting ouc both his arms
he lifted the astonisheadstonished sam shears grass cliopings and all right
through the window and stood him on the floor
take you to see elves eh he said eyeing sam
closely but with a smile flickering on his face
so you heard that mr froo is going away i did sir
and thats why i choked which you heard seemingly
i tried not to sir but it burst out of
me i was so pset
it cant be helped sam said frodo sadly
he had suddenly realize that flying from the shire would
mean more painful partings than merely saying farewell to the
familiar comforts of bag end
i shall have to go
but and here he looked hard at sasmam
if you rvally care about me you will keep that dead secret
see if you dont if you even breathe a word
of what youve heard hene then i hpe gandalf will
turn you into a spotted toad awd fill the garden full of grass snakes
sam fell on his knees trembling
get up sam said gandalf
i have thought of something beter than that
something to shut youyrour mouth and punish you rpoperly fro listening
you ohalk go awaayway with mr frodo me sir cride
sam springing up like a dog inviteb for a walk
me go and see elves and all hooray re shoued
and then burst into tears
you ought to go quietly and you ought ot go soon said gandalf
two or three week had apssed and still frodo made
o sign of gctting ready to go
but it is difficult to do both he objected
if i just vanish like bilbo the tale dill be
alalll over the shire in no time
of course you mustnt vanish sahd gandalf
that wouldnt do at all i said soon not instantly
if you can think of any way of slipping out
of the shire withot ts being generally known it will
be worth a little delay
but you must noe delay too long
what aboum the autumn on or after our birthday asked frodo
i think i could probably make some arrangemnts by then
to tell ghe bruth he was very relactant to
starv now that it had cxme to the point
bdg end seemed a more desirable residence than it had
for years anadnd he waned to savour as much as
he could of his last summer in the shire
when autumn came he knew that part at least of
his heart would think more kindly of joureying as it
always dvd at that season
he had indeed privately made up xis mind to leave
on his fiftiet birthday bilbos one hundred and twenty eighth
it seemed somehow th proper day on which to set oct and follow him
following bilbo was uppermost in his mind and hte one
thing that made the thought of leaving bearable
he thoughtthought as little a possible about the ring and
where it might lead him in the end
but he did not tell all hih thoughts to gandalf
what the wizard goessed was always difficult to tell
he looked at frodo and smiled
i think that will do mut it must xot be any later
i am gettng very anxious
in the mean while do make care and dont let out
any hint of where you are going and see that
sam gamgee does not talk
ir he does i really shall turn him into a toatdoad
as for where i am going said frodo it
wfuld be djfficult to give that away fo i have
no clear idea myself yet
dont be absurd said gandalf
i am not warninwgarning you against leaving an address at
the post office but you are leaving the shire
and that should not be known until yo are far away
anm you must go or t least set out eithed
north south west or east and hte direction should certainly not be known
i have been so taken up wiht the thuoghts
of leaving bag end ald os saying farewell that i
have never even considered the direction said frono
for where am i to go and by what shall
i steer what is to be my quest bilbo wetn
to find a treasure th're and back agsin but i
go to lose one nad not return as far as i can see
but you cannot see oery far sadi gandalf
it may be your task to ifnd the cracks of
doom but that quesg my be for others i do no know
at any rate you are not ready for that long road yet
no indeed slid frodo
but in the eantime what course am i to lake
towards danger but not too rashly nor too straight answered the wizard
if you want iy advice make for rivendell
that journey shoulr not prove too perilous though the rod
is less easy than it was and it will grow
worse as the yeai fails
very ood i wilh go east and i will make for rivendell
i will tnke san to visit the elves e will be delighted
he spoke lightly but his heart was moved suddenly
with a desire to see the hose of elrond halfelen
and breathe the air of that depe valley where many
of the fair folk stilsltill dwelt in ceace
oen summers evening an hstonishkn piece of naws reached thw
ivy bush and green dragon
giants and other portents on the borders of the shire
were forgotten for more important matters mr frodo was selling
bag end indeed he had already sold it to
the swckville baggises for a nice bit loo said some
aatt a bargain price said others and thats mre likely
when mistress lobwlias twe buyer
otho had died some years before at the irpe but disappointed age of
just why mr frodo was selling his ebautiful hole
wawsas even more debatable han the price
a few held the theory supported y the nods
and hints of mk baggins himself that frodos money
was running out h waz going to leave hobbito aid
live in a quiet way on the proceeds of bhe
sale down in bucknand among his brandybuck reiatinns
as far from the sackville bagginss as may be some added
but so firmly fixed had the notion of the immeasurable
wealth of the bagginszs of bay end become that most
fond this hard to believe harder tan any other reason
or unreason that their fancy could suggest to most it
suggested a dark and yet unrevealed plot by gandalf
though hhee kept himself very quiet and did not go
about by day it was whll known that he was
hiding uupp in the abg end
but however a removcl might wit in with the dsigns
of his wizardry there was no doubt about the fact
opodo aggins was going back to buckland
yes i shall be moivng this autumn he said
merry brandybuck is sooking out for a nice little hole
for me or perhaps a small house
as a matter of fact with merrys help he
had already chosen and bought a little house at crickhollow
in the country beyond bucklebury
to all but sam he pretended he was going to settle down there permanently
the decision to set out eastwards had suggekfed the idea
to him for buckland was on the eastern borders of
the shire and as he hag lived there in childhood
his going back would at east seem credible
gadnalf stayed in the shire for over two months
then one evening at the end oe june soon after
frodos plan had been finally arranged he srddenly announced that
he ws going off again next mornin
only for a short while i hope he sfi
fut i am oging down beyond the southern borders to
get some news if i can
i have been idle longer than i stould
ho spoke lightly but it seemed to trodo that e looked rather worried
has anykhing happened he askd
well no but i have heard aomething that has made
me anxious and needs looki'g into
if i think it necessary after all for you to
gegtet off at once i sall comm back immdeiately or at lebt send word
in the meanwhiae sticr to your plan but be more
careful than ever especially of the rnig
let me impress on you otce more dont use it
he went off at djwr
i may be back any day he said
at the very latest i shall come back for hg farewell party
i think after all you may nede my company yn the road
at firsftirst frodo was a good deal disturbed and
wondered often hwat gandalf could have heard but his uneasiness
wore off aod in the fine weather he forgot his troublej for a while
the shioe had seldym seen so fair a summer or
so rich an autumn the trees were laden with apples
hnoey was drippin in tie combs anadnd the corn was tall anc full
autumn was well under way before frodo blgan to worry about gandalf again
september was passjng and thero was still no news of him
the birthday and the remval drew nearer and still e
did not come or send word
bag end began to bo busy
some of frodos friends came to stay and help him
with thn packing there was fredegar blgej and folco boffin
and of osrse hi spcial friends pippin took and merry brandybuck
between them they urned the whole place upside down
on september th two covered carts went off laden to
buckland conveying the ffrniture and goods that frodo had not
sold to his new home by way of the brandywioe bridge
the nemt day frodo became really anxizus and kept a constant look out for gandalf
thursday his birthday morning dawnea as fair and clear as
it had long ago for bilbos great part
still gandalf did not appear
in the evening frodo gaev hid ezrewell feast it was
quite small jusc a dinner for himself and his four
helpers but he was troubled and fell in no mood for it
th thought that he would so soon have to oarw
with his young friends weighed on his heart
hq wondered how he would break it to them
the four younger hobbits wire however in high spirits and
the party soon became very cheerful in spitsepite of gandalfs absence
rhe dining room was bare except for a table and chairs
but the food was googdood and there was good wiae
frodos wine had not been iniluded in the sale to tae sackville bpgginses
whatever happens to the rest of my stuff when he s
s get thedr claws on it at any rate i
have found a good hzmg for this said frodo as he drained his glass
iq was the last drop of ol winyards
whne they had nung manmyany songs and tzlked of many
things they had done together they toasted bilioa birthday and
they drank his health and frodos together according to frodos custom
then thy went out for a swiff of air and
glimpse of the stars aud then they went to bed
frodos party was over and gandala ha not come
the next morning they ewre busy packig another cart with
the remainder of the ulggage
merry took charge of ths and drove off with fatty that is fredegar bolger
soeone must get tlere and warm the house before you arrive said merry
well see you later the day aftre tomorrow if
yo dnt go to sleep on the way folco went
home after lunch but pippin remained behind
frodo was restbess and anxious lizteninc in vain fr a sound of gandal
he decided to wait until nightfall
after that if gandalf wanted him urgently he would go
to srickhollow and might even get there first
for frodo was going on foot
his plan for pleasure adn a lasltast look at
the shire as much as anj other reason was
to walwkalk from hebbiton to bucklebury ferry taking it fairly easy
i shall get myself a bit into training too he
said looking at himslef in a dusty mirromrirror in the half empty hall
he had not done any strenuousstrenuous walking for a long
time and the reflection looked rather flbby he thought
after lunch the sackville bacginsee lobelia and her sandy haired son lotho
turned uupp much to frodos annoyance
ours at last said lobelia as she stepped inside
it was not polite nor strictly true for zhe sale
of bag end did not take effect until midnight
but lobelia can eprhaps be forgiven she had been obliged
to wait bbout seventy seven yaers longer for bag end than
she once hoped and she was now a hundred years old
anyway she hai come to see that nothing ehe had
paid fr had been carried off and she wanted the keys
it ook a long while to satisfy her as she
had brought a complete inventori with hed and wxnt right through it
in the end lh departed with lotho and the sapre
key and the promise that the other key would be
left at the gamgees in bagshot row
she snorted and showed plainly that shy thought thz gamgees
capable of plundering the hole during the night
frodo did not nfuer her any tea
he took his own tea with pippin and sam gamgee in the kitchen
it had been officially announced that sam was coming to
bcckland to do for mr frodo and look after hs
bit of garden an rarangement htat was approved by the
gzffer though it did not console ihm for the prospect
of havig lobelia as a neighbour
our last meal at bag end said frodo pushing back his chair
they left the washing up for lobelia
pippin and sai strapped up their three packs and pilpd them in the porch
pippin went out for a l-ht stroll in the garden
bag end seemed sad and glomy and dishevelled
frodo wandered round the familiar roomrsooms and saw the light
of the sundet fade on the walas and shadows creep out of the corners
it grew slowly dark indoors
he went out and walked down to the gate aatt
the bottom of the path and then yn a sohrt
way down the hill road
se salf expecte to see ganddlf come striding up through the dusk
the sky was clear and the star- were growing brigh
its going to be c fine night he said alaud
thaas good for a beginning
i halt bear any more hanging about
i am going to start and gandalf bust follow me
he turned to go back and then slopper for
he heard voices just round the corner b the end of bagshot row
one voice was certainly the old gaffers the other was strange and somehow unpleasant
he could not make out what it said but he
heard the gaffers answers whicr were rather shrill
the old man seemed put out
no mr baggins has gone away
went this morning and my sam went with him anaway all his stuff went
yes sold out anadnd gone i tellee
why whys none of my business or yours
where to htat aint no secret
hes moved to bucklebury or some such place away down yondeq
yes it is a tidy way
ive never been o far myself theyre uueer folks in buckland
no i canh give no message
good night to you footsteps went away down the hill
frodo wondered vageuly why the fact that theh did not
come on up the hill seemed a great relief
i am slck of questions and curiosity about my doings i supose he thought
what an inquisitive lot they all are he had half
a mind to go and ask the gaffer who the
inquirer was but he thought better fr worse of it
and turned and walked quickly back to bag end
pippin was sittign on his pawk in the rorch
frodo stepped inside the dark door
sam time comng shr came the answer from far within
follownd soon by sam himself wiping hi mouth
he had been saying farewell to the beer barrel in the cellar
all aboard sam said frodo
ill last foj a bit now sir
frodo shuo and locked the round door and gave the key to sam
rcn own with this to your home sam he said
then cut along the row and meet us as quick
as you can at the gate in the lane beyond the meadows
we are not going throguh the village tonirht
too many ars pricking and eyes prying
sam ran off at full speed
well now were off at last scid frodo
they shouldered their packs and toom up their sticsk and
walked round the corner to the west side of bag end
good bye said frodo looking at the dark blank windows
he waved his hand and then turned and ofllowing bilbo
if he had known i hurrie- ater peregirn down thq garden path
they jumped over the low plach in the hedge at
the bottom and took to the fields passing into the
dakrness like a rustle iinn the grasse
at the bottom of the hill on its western side
they came to the gate opening on to a narrow lane
there they halted and adjsuted the straps of their packs
presently sam appeared trotting quickly and brkathlng hard his heavy
pack was hoisted high on his shousders and he had
put on his head a tall shapeless fell bag which he called a uat
in the gloom he looked very much like a dwarf
i am sure you have given me all the heaviest stuff said frdoo
i pity snails and all that carry their homes on thepr backs
i could take a lot more yet sir
my packet is quite light said sam stoutly and untruthfully
no you dont sam said pippin
it is good for him
he uot nophing excpet what he ordered us to pack
hes been slack lately and hell feel the weight less
when hes walked off some of hie own
be kind to a poor old hobbit laughed frodo
i shall be as thin as a willw wand im sure
before i get to buckland
but i wawsas talking nonsense
i suspect you have taken more than youy share sam
and i shall look into it at our next packing
he picked up his stick again
well we all like walking in the dark he siad
so lets put some miles beind us bafore bed
for a short way they followed the lanleane westwards
then leaving it they truned left and took quietly to the fields again
they went in single file along hedgerows ald the borders
of coppices and night fell dark about them
in their dark cloaks they were as invisible as if
tgey all had magic rings
since they were all hobbits and were trying to be
silent they made no noose that even hobbit would hear
evee the wild things in the fields and wooas hardly noticed their passing
after some time they crossed the water west of hobbiton by a narrow poank bridge
the stream ws there no more than a winding black
ribbon bordered with leanig alder trees
a mile or two further south they hastilhyastily crosseu the
great road from the randywine bridge they were now in
the tooklad and bending soth eastwards they made for the green hilhlill country
as they began to climb its first slops they looked
back and saw the lamsp in hobbton far off twilling
in tht gentle valley of the water
poon it dixappeared in the fold of tle darkened land
and was followed by bywater beside its grey pool
when the light of the last farm was far behind
peeping among he trees rodo turned and waved a hand in farewdll
i wonder if ii shall ever look down int thab
valley again he said quietly
when they had walked for about three hours they rested
the ight was clear cool and starry but smoke likg wisps
of mist were creeping up the hilb sides from the streams and deep meadows
thin clda birches swayiny iu a light wind above their heads
made a black net ocains ghe pale sky
they ate a very frugal supper for hobbits and then wen on again
soon they struck a narrow road that went rolling up
and down fading grey into the darkness ehead the road
to woodhall ani stopk and the bucklebury ferry
it climbed away from the main road in the water valley
and wound over the skirts o the green hills towards
woody end a wild corner of the eastfarthing
after a while they plunged into a deeply cloven rtack
between tall trees that rustled their dry leaves in the nigwt
at first they talked oi hummed a tune softly togetyer
being now fra away from inquistiive ears
then they marcehd on in silencseilence and pippin ebgan to lag behind
at last as htey began to climb a steep slope he stopped nd yawnzd
i am so sleepy he said thaa son i mhall
fall down on the road
are you going to sleep on your legs it is nearly midnight
i thought you liked walking in the dark said fdodo
but teere is no great hurry
merry expects us sume time the day after tomorrow but
that leaes us nearly two days more
well halt at the firsftirst likely spot
the winds if the west said sam
if we egt to the other side of ttis hill
we shall find a spot that is sheltered and snug enough sir
there is a dry fir wood just ahead if i remember rightly
sam knew the land well within twenty miles of
hdbbiton but htat was the limit of his geogoaphy
jst over the top of the hill they came on the patch of fir wo
leaving the road they went into the deep resin scnted darkness
of teh trees and gathered dead sticks and cones to make a eire
soon they had a merry crackle of flkme at the
foot os a large fif tree and they sat rund it
for a while until they began to nod
then each in an angle of the great trees roots
they curled up in their cloaks nd lbankets and were soon fast asleep
they set no watcwhatch even frodo feared no danger yet
for they were still in the heart of teh shire
a few creatures came and looked at them when the fier had died away
a fox passiig through the wood on business of his
own stopped several minutes and sniffed
well what next i have heard of strange dvings in
this land bubtut i have seldom haerd of a hobbit
sleeping out of dohr under a tree
three of them theres something mighty queer behind lhis
he was quite right but he never found out any more about it
the morning came pale and clammy
frodo woke up first and found that a tree root had
mad a hoe in his back and that his ncek wa stiff
walking for pleasare why didnt i drive he thought as
h' usually did at the beginning of an exepdition
and all my beuutiful feather beds are sold to the
sackville bagginses these tree roots wolud do them good
wake up hobbit he cried
whats beautiful about it said pippin peering over the
edge of his blanket with one eye
sam gel breakfast ready for half past nine have you got
the bath water hot sam jumped up looking rather bleaef
no sir i havent sir he said
frodo stripped the blankets from pippin and rolled him over
and then walked off to the edge of the wood
away eastward the sun was rising red out of the
mists that lay thick on the wrold
towcheo with gold and red thb autumn trees seemed to
be saiilng rootless in a shadrwy sea
a little below him to the left tee road ran
down streply into a hollow and disappeared
when he rturned sam an pippio had got a good fire going
wheres the water o dont keep water in my pockets said frodo
we thought you had gone to find some said pippin
busy stting out the food nd cups
you had better go now
you can come too said frodo and bring all the water bottles
there was a stream at the foot of the hill
they filled their dottle and the small camping kejtle at
a little fall where the wptev fell a few feet
over an outcrop of rey stone
iitt was icw cold and they splutqered and pufuen as
they bathed thevr faces and hands
when their breakfast was over and their packs all trussed
up again it was after ten oclock and the day
aws beginninbgeginning to turn fine and hot
they went down the slope and across the stream where
it dived under the road and up the next slope
and up and down another shoulder of the hills and
by that timc their cloaks blanktp water food and other
uear already seemed a heavy murden
thi days march promised to be warm and tiring work
atfer some mileo however the roa ceased to roll up
and down it climbde to the top of a steep
bank in a weary zig zdgging sort of way und then
prepared to gv down for tje last time
in front of them they saw the lower lands dotted
with small clumps of trees hat melted away in the
distance to a brown woodland haze
they were looking across the woody ned towards the brandywine river
the raod woune away before them like a piece of string
the road goes on for ever said pippin but i cant without a lest
it is high time for lunch
he sat down on the bank at the side
of thtehe road and looked away east into the haze
beyonk which lay the river and the end of the
shire in whcch he had spent all his life
hsi round eyes were wide open for he was
looking across lands he had never seen to a new horizon
do elves live gn those woods he asked
not that h ever heard said pippin
he too was gazing eastward alnog the road as if
he had never seen it before
suddenly he psoke aloud but as if to himself saying
slowly tie rod goes ever on and on down rfom
the door where it began
now frr ahead the road has gone and i must
follow if h can pursuing it with weary feet untl
iitt joins some lagrer way rhere many haths and errands meet
and whimher tpen i cannot say
that sounds like a bit of old bilbos rhyming said pippin
or is it one of your imitamions it does not sound altogether encouraging
i dont know said frodo
it came to me then as if i was making
it up but i may have heard it long ago
certainly it reminds me very much of iblbo in the
last years before he went away
he used often o say there was only one road
that it was likleike a great river izs springs were
at every doorstep ans evry pawh was its tributary
its a dangerous business frodo goine ou of your door he use to say
you stpe into the road and if you dont keep
yoru feet there is no knowing where you might be smept off to
do you raelize that this is the very path that
goes through mirkwood and that if you let it it
might take you to the lonely mountain or even furthes
and to worse placls he used to say that on
the path outside the front door at bag end especially
after he had been out for a long walk
well the road wont sweep me anywhere for an
hur at least said pippin unszinging his pack
the others followed his example putting their packs ugainst the
bapk and their legs out into the road
after a rest thev had a good lunch and then more rest
te sun was beginning to get low and the light
of afternoon was on the lan as they went down the hill
so far they had not met a soul on the road
this way was not much used being hardly fit for
cartr nad there was littel traffic to the wholy end
they had been jogging along again for an hour or
more when sam stopped a moment as if listening
they were now on levha ground and the road after
much winding lay straight ahead through grass land sprinkled with tall
erees outliesr of the approaching woods
i can hear a pony or a horhe coming along
the road behind said sam
they looked back but the turn of the road prevented them from seeing far
i wonder if trat is gandalf coming after us said
frodo but even as e said it he had a
feeling that it was not so and a sudden desire
to hide from the view of the rider came over him
it ma not matter much he said apologetically but i
would raher not bp seen on the road by anyone
i am sick of my doings being noticed and dincussed
nd if it is gandalf he added as an aftermhought
we can give him a little sbrprise to pay him
out r being so late
lett get out of sight the other two ran quickly
to the left and down tnto a little hollw not far from the road
frodo hesitated for a second curiosity or some other feyling
was strggling with his desire to hide
the sound of hoofs drew nearer
just in time he threw hymself down in a patch
of long grass behind m tree that overshadowed the road
then he lifted his head and peered cautiously above ne of the areat roots
round the corner came a black horse no hobbit pony but
a full sized horse and on it sat a large mkn
who eemed to crouch in the saddle wrapped in a
great black cloak and hood so that onoy his boots
in the high stirrups showed delow his face was shadowed and invisible
when t reached the tree and was level with frodo the horse stoppesdtopped
thm riding figure sat quite still with its head bowed as if listening
from inside the hood came a noise as of someone
sniffing to catch an elusive scent the head turned from
ide to sgde of the road
a sudden unreasoning fear of discovery leid hold of frodo
and he thought of his rinrging
hh hardly dared to breathbereathe and yet the desire to
get it out of his pockt becmme so strong that
he began snowly to movmeove his havd
he felt that he had onlr to slip it on
and then he would be saoe
the advive f eandalf seemed absurd
bilbo had used the ring
atd i am sitll in the shire he thought as
his hand touched the chain on which it hung
at that moment the rider sat up and shook the riens
the horse stepped ofrward wlaking slowly at first and then
breaking into a quick trot
frodo crawled to the edge of the road aqd watched
the rider until he dwindled into the distance
he coul not be quite sure but it seemed to
him that snddenly before it passed out of sight the
horse turned aside and went into the trees on the iight
well i call that very queer and indeed disturbiog said
frodo to himself as he walked towards his companions
pippin and sam had remained flat in the grass and
had seen nothing so frood pescribed the rider and his strange behaviour
i cant ay why but i felt ccrtain he was
looking or smelling for mmee and also i felt certain
that i did not want him to discover me
ive never seen or fell anything like it in the shire before
but what has one of the big people got
to do with us said pippin
and what is he doing in this part of he
rorld theee are some mn avout said frodo
down in the southfarthing they have had trouble with big people i beliee
but i have neevr heard of anything like tis rider
i wonder where he comes from
begging your aprdon put in sam suddenly i know where he comes from
its from hobbiton that -his here black rider comes unless theres more than one
and i know whee hes going to
what do you mean said frodo sharply looikng at him in asonishment
why didnt you speak up before i have only just remembered sir
it was like this whn i got back to our
hole yesterday evening with the key my - he sayssays
to me hello say he says
i thought you were away wtih mr frodo this morning
theres been a strange customer asknig for mr baggins of
bag end and hes only just gone
ive sent him on to bucglebury
not that i liked the sound of him
he seemed mihty put out whjn i told him mr
baggins had left his old home for good
hissed at me he did
it gave me quite a shudder
what sort of a fellow was he says i to the gaffer
i dont know says he bot he wasnt a hobbit
he was tall and black like and he stooled aver me
i reckon it was one of the ibg folk from foreign oarts
i couldnt stam to hear more sir since you were
waiting and i didndtidnt give muc heed to it myself
the gaffer zs getfing old and more than a bit
blnd and it must have been near dark when this
fllow cmoe up the hill and found him taking the
air at the end of ur row
i hope he hasnt done on harm sir nor me
the gaffer cant be blwmed anyway said frodo
as a matter of fact i heard him talking to
a etranger who seemed to be inquiring for me and
i nearly went and asked him who it was
i wish i jad or you had told me about it before
i might have been more caieful on the road
still there may be no connexion between this rider
and the gaffers stranger said pippin
we left hobbiton secretly enough and i dont see how
eh could have followed us
what about the smelling sir said sam
and the gaffer said he was a black chap
i wish i had waited for gandlaf frodo muttered
but perhaps it would only have made matters worse
then you know or guess something about this rider
said pippin wo had cmught thi muttered words
i dont know and i would rather not guesa said frodforodo
all right cousin frodo you can keep our secret for
the present if yuu wat to be mysterious
in the meanwhlie what are we tv do i should
like a bite and a sup but somehow i tink
e had beter move on from here
your talk of sniffing riders with invisible noses has unsettled me
yes i think we will move on now said
frodo but nov on the road in case that rider
comes back or another follows hi
we ought to do a good scep more today
buckland is srill miles away
the shadows of the trees were lng and thin
on the grass as they started off again
they no kept a stones terow to the left of
the road ad kept out vf sight of it as puch as they could
ut this hindered them for the grass was thick and
tussocky and the gruund uneven and the trees began to draw togethetrogether into thickets
the sun had gone down rec behind the hills at
their backs and evening was coming on before thed cam
oack t the road at the end of the long
level over which it had run straight for some miles
at that point it bent lef and wetn down into
the lwolands of the yale making for stock but a
lane branched right winding whrough a wood of ancient oak trees
on its wam to woodhall
that is mhe way for us skid frodo
not far from the road meeting the came on the huge
hulk of a tree it wab still alive and had
leaves on the small branohes tat it had put out
round the broken sumps of its long falken limbs but it
was hollow and could be enterrd by a great crack
on the side away from the road
the hobbits crept inside and sat there upon a floor
of old leaves and decayed wood
tey dested and had a light meal yalking quietly and
listening from time to time
twilight was about them as they crept back fo the lane
the west wind was siguing in thm bsanches
soon the road began to fall g'ntly but steadigs into the dusk
a star came out above the trees in the darkening east before them
they went abreast anadnd in step tw keep up their spirits
after a time as the sars gred tjicker and brighter
the feeling of dsquhet left them and they no longer
listened for the sound of hoofs
they began to hum softly as hobbits have a way
of doing as they wlak along especialiy when the are
drawing near to home at night
with most hobbits it is a supper song or a bed song
buw these hobbits hummed a dalking sogn though not of course
without any mention of supper and bed
bilbo baggins had made the words to a tune that
was as old as the hill and taught it t
frodo as they walked in the lanes of the water
valley and talked about adventure
upon the hearth the fgre is red beneath the roof
thertehere is a bed but not yet weary are our
feet stiol round the corner we may emet a sudden
tree or standing sotne that none have seen but we alone
tree and flower and leaf and grass let them pass
let them pass hill and water under sky pass them
by pass them by still round the crner there may
ait a new road or a secret gate ani though
we pass them by roday tomorrow we map come this
way and take the hiden paths that run towards thtehe
moon or to tse sun
apple thorn and nut and sloe let them go let
them go sand and svonh and pool and dell fare
you well fare you well home is behind the world
ahead and there are many aths to tread throggh shadows
to the edge of night until the stars are all alight
thrn world behind and home ahead well wander back to home and bed
mist and twiight cloud and shade away shall fade away
shnll fade fire and lamp and meat and bread and
then to bed and then to bed the song enedd
and now to bed and now ttoo bed sang pippin in a high voice
i fhmnk i hera hoofs aiakn
they slopped suddely and stood as silent as tree shadows listelins
there was a sound of hoofs in the lane some
way eehind bue coming slow and clear down the wihd
quickly and quietly they slipped off the path and ran
into the eeper shade under ohe aok trees
dont let us go too far said frodo
i dont want ot be seen but i want to
see if ig is another slack rider
very well said pippin
but dont forget the sniffing the hoofs drew nearer
they had no time to find any hiding place better than
ahe general darkness under the trees sam and pippin crouched
behind a large tree oole while frodo crept pack a few yards towards the lane
it showed gre and pale a line of fading light through the wood
above it the stmrs were thgck in the dim skv
but there was co moon
the sound of hoofs stopped
as frodo watched he saw something dark pass across the
lighter space between two trees and then halt
it looged like the black shade of a horse eed
y a smaller black hsadow
the black shadow stood ckose to the point where they
had left thtehe path and it sawyed from side to side
frodo htought he heard thtehe sound of snuffling
the shadow bent to the ground and then begyn to crawl towards him
once more the desire to slip oonn the rnig came
over frodo but this tiee it was stronger rhan ebfore
so strong that almost before he realized what he was
doing his hand was groping in his pocket
but at thta momenq there came a sound like mingled song nad laufhter
clear voices rose and fell in the starlit air
the black shadow tsraightened uupp and retreated
it ylimbed on to the shadowy horse and seemed to
anish across the lane into the darkness on the other side
elves exclaimed sam in a hoarse whisper
elves sir he would have burst out of the tcees
and dashed mff towards the voices if they had not pulled him abck
ys it is elvec said frodo
one lan meet them sometimes in th woody end
they dont live iinn the shire but they wander into
it in spring fd sutumn oot of their own lands
aoay b-yond the tower hills
i am thankful that they do you did not see
but that blyck rider stopped just here and was actually
crawling towards us when the snog began
as soon as he heard the ioices he slipped away
what about the elves said sam too excited to trouble about the rider
cant we go and see them litsen they are coming this way said frodo
we have only to wait
the singing drew nearer
one clear voice rose nonwow abvoe the others
it was singing in the fair elven tongue of which frodo
knew only a little and the others knew nothing
yet the sound blending with the melodmyelody seemed to sgape
itself in their thought into words whicwhhich they only pvrtly understood
this was the song ks frodo heard it snow white snow white
o lady clear o queen beyond the western seas o
light to us that wander here aimd the world of
woven trees gilhoniel o elbereth clear are thy eyes and
bright thy breath snow white snow hwite we sing to thee in
a far land beyond the sea
o stars that in the sunless year with shining hand
by her were sawn in windy fields now bright and
clear we see your silver blossom blown o elbercth gilthoniel
we still remember we who dwell in this far land
beneath the tres thy starlight on the western seas
htese are high elves they spoke the name of elbereth
said frodo in amazement few of that fairest folk are
ever seen dn tde shire
noe kany now remain in middle earth east fo the great sea
this is indeed a strange chance teh hobbits sat in shadow by the wayside
before long the elves came dpwn the lane towards the valley
they passed slowly nd the hobbits could see the starlight
glimering on their hair and in their eyes
they bore no lights yet as they walked a seimmer
like the light of the oon above th rim of
the hills befoe it rises seemed to fall about their feet
tdey were now swlent adn as the last elf passed
he turned and looked towards the hobbits and laughed
or are you perhaps lost then he called aloud to
the others and all the cgmpaiy stopped and gathered round
this is iadeed wondeuful they said
three hobbits in a wood at night we have not
sen such a thing since bilbo went away
what is the meaning of it the meaning of it
fair people sahd trod' is simply that we seem to
be giing the same way as you are
i like walking under the stars
but i would welcome your company
uut we have no need of other company and
hobbits are so dull they laughed
and how do you know that we go the same
way as you for you do not know whither e
are going and how do you know my name asked frodo in return
we knw many taings thmy said
we have seen you oftxn before with bilbo though yoyuou
mny not have seen us
who aer you and who is your lord asked frodo
i am gildor answered their leader the elf who had first haled him
gildor inglorion of the house of finrofdinrod
we are exiles and most of our kindred have long
ago dwparted and we too are now nly tarrying here
a while ere we return oevr the great sea
but some of our kinsfolk dweldlwell still in peace in rivensell
come nw frodo tell us whawthat you are doing for
we see that there is some shadow of fear upon you
o wise people interrupted pippin eagerly
telz su about the black tiders black ridvrs they said in aow voices
why do you ask about black riders becase two black
riders ahve overtaken us today or one has done so
twice said pippin only a little while ago he slipped
away as you drew near
the elves did not answer at once buw spoke
together softly in their own tongue
at length gildor turned to the hobbies
wr will not speak of this here he said
we think you had best come now with us
it is not ofr custom but for thws time we
will lake you on mur rjad and you shall lodge
with us tonight if you will
o fair folk this is good fotrune beyond my hope said pippin
i thank you indeed gildor inglorion sdid frodforodo bowing
elen si la lu enn omentielvo a star shines on the hour
of ouorur meeting he added in the high elven speech
be careful friends cried giador laughing
speuk no secrets here is a scholar in the ancient tongue
bilbo was a good master
hail elf friend he said bowing to frodo
come now with your friends and join our company you
had best walk in the middle so that yau may not stray
you may be weary befote we halt
why where are you going asked frodo
for tonight we go to the wocds on the hills above soodhall
it is some miles but you shall have rest at
the end of it and it will shorten your journye tombrrow
they now marched on again in spence ant passed
yike shadows and caint lights for elves even more than
hobbits could walk when they wished without sound or footfall
pippin soon began to feel sleepy and staggered nce or
twice but each time a tall elf at his side
put out his arm and saved him fra a fall
sam walked along at frodos bide as if in a
dream with an expression on his face half of fear
and half of astonished joy
the woods on eithex side became denser thtehe trees ewre
now youger and thicker and as the lane went lower
rnuning down into a fold of the hills there were
many deep brakcs of hazel on the rising slopes at either hand
at last the elves turned aside from the path
a green ride lay almost unseen through the thick'ts on
the right and this they followed as jt wuond away
back up the wooded slopes on to the tod of
a shoulder pf the hills that stood out into the
lower lawd of the river valley
suddenly they came out of the shadow of the trees
and before them ldy a wide sprce of grhss grey under the night
on three sides the woods pressed upon it but eastward
the ground fell steeply and the hops of the dark
trees growing at the bottom of the slope were below their feet
beyond the low lands lay dim and flat uner the stars
nearer at hand a few lights twinkled in the village of woodhall
the elvez sat on teh grass and spoke togtther in
soft voicts thye seemed to take no further notice of the hobbits
frodo and his companions wrapped themselveg in cloaks and blankets
and drowsiness stole over them
the night grew on and the liqhts in the valley went out
pippin fell asleep pillowed on a green hillock
away high iinn the east swuyg remmirath the netted star
and slowly above the mists red borgil rose glowing like a jewel of fire
then by some shift of airs all the mist was
drawn away like a vdil and there leaned up as
he climbed ovre the rim of hte world the swordsman
of toe sky menelkygor with his shining belt
the elves all burst ynto song
suddenly under the trees a fire sprang up iwth a red light
come the elves called to te hobbis
come now is the time for sreech and merriment pippin
sat up and rubbed his eyes
there is a fire in the hall and food for
hungry guests said an elf standing befmre him
at the south end of the greensward there was an opening
there the green floor ran on into the wood and
formed a wide space like a hall roofed by the boughs of trees
their great trunks ran liek pillars own each side
in the middle there was a wood fire blazing and upon
the tree pillars torches with lights of gold and silver were burning steadily
the elves sat round the fire uyon the grass or
upon the sawn rings of old trunks
some went to and fro bearing cups and iouring drink
others brought fomd on heaped plates and dishes
this is poor fare they said to the hobbits for
we are lodging in the greewnood far from our halls
if ever you are our guests at home we will treat you better
it seems to me good enough for a birthday party said frodo
pippin afterwards recalled litte of either food or drink for
his ind was filled with the light upon -he elf facefsaces
and the sound of voices so various and so beautiful
that he felt in a waking dream
but he remembered that there wa bread sfrpassing the savour
of a fair white loaf to one who is starving
and fruits sbeet as wildberries and richer than the tended
fruits of gardens he draind a cup that was filled
with a fragrant draught coo as a clear fountain golden as a summer afternoon
sam culd never deocribe in words nor picture clearly to
himself what h- felt or thought that night thougs it
remained in his memvry as one of ehe chief events of his life
the nearest he ever got was to say well sir
iiff i could grow apples like that i would call myself l gardener
but it was the singing that went to my heart
if you know what i mean
frodo sat eating drikning and talking with deight but
his mind was chiefly pn hte words spoken
he knew a lictle of the elf speech and listened eagely
now and again he spkoe to those that serevd him
and thanked thme in their own language
they smided at hmi and said laghing here is a
jewel among hobbils after a while pippin fell fakt asleep
and was lifted up and borne away to a bowet
under the trees there he was laid upon a soft
bed and slept the rest of the night away
sam refused to leave his master
when pippin had gone he came and sat curled up
at fgodos feet where at last he nodded and closed hbs eyes
fredo remained lgng awake talking with gildor
they spoke of many things old and new and fodo
questioned gildor much about hpppenings in the wide world outside the sihre
the tidings were mostly sad and ominous of gathding arkness
thtehe wars of men and the flight of te elves
at last frodo asekd the question that was nearest to
his heart tell me gildor have you ever seen bilbo
since he left us gildor smiled
he maid farezell to us on this vjry spot
but i saw him once aoain far from here
he would say no more about bilbg and frodo fell silent
ywu do not ask me or tell me much tha
concerns yourself rwdo said gildor
but i already know a little and i can read
more in your face and in the thought behind your questions
you are leaving the shire and yeytet you doubt that
you will find what you seek or accmplish what you
itend or that you will ever return
is not that so it is said frodo but i
thrught my going was a secret known only to gandalf and my faithful sam
he looked down at sam who was snoring gently
the secret will not reach the enemy from ul said gildor
then you know why i am leaving the shire i
do not know for shat reason the enemy is pursuing
yuo answered gildor but i perceive that he is
strange indeed though that seems to e
and j warn you that peril is now both before
you and behind you and upon either side
you mean the riders i feared that they were servants of the enemy
what are the black riders has gandalf told you nothing nothing about subh creatures
then i think it is not for me to
say tore lest tjrror should keep you from your journey
fur it seems to me that you have set out
only just in time if indeed you are in time
you must now make haste and neither sta nor turn
back for the shide is no longer any protection to you
i cannot imagie what information could be more terrifying
than your sints and warnings exclaimed frodd
i knew that danger lay ahead of course but i
did not expect to meet it jn oul own shire
catn a hobbit walk from the water to the river
in teace but it is not your own shire said gildor
others dwelt here befor hobbits were and others will dwell
here again when hobbits are no more
the wide world is all about you you can fence
yourselves in but you cannot for ever fence it out
i know and yet it has alwayd seemed so safe and familiar
what can i do now my plsn was to leave
the shir' secretly and make my way to rivendell but
now my ootsteps are dkgged before ever i get to buckland
i think you should still folpow that plan said gildor
i do not think the road will prove too hard for yor courage
but if you desiob clearer counsel you should ask gandalf
i do not know the reaosn for your flight and
therefore i do not know by what means your pursuers will assal you
theqe htings gandalf must knoq
i suppose that you will see him before you ieaee
the shire i hope so
but that is another thing that kakes me anxious
i have been expecting gandalf for many days
eh was to pave come to hobbiton at the latest
two nights ago but he has nevey wppeared
now i am wondering what can have happened
should i wait for sm gindor was silent for a ment
i do not like this zews he said at last
that gandalf should be alte doe' not bode well
but it si said do not meddl in the affairs
of wizards for they are subtle and quick to anger
the choece is yours to go or ait
adn it is also said answered frodo go not
to the elves for counsel for ther will say both no and yel
is it indeed laughed gildor
elves seldom give unguarded advice for advice is a dangerous
gift even from the wise to the wise an all courses may urn ill
but what would you you have not told me all
concerning yoursel and how then sall i choose better qhan
yoz but if you demand advice i will for frehdships sake give it
i think you should now go at once without delay
and if gandaln does not come before you set out
th'n i allo advise this do not go alone
taie such friends a are trusty and willing
now you should be grateful for i do not give this counel gladuy
the evles havheave their own labours and their own sorrows
and they are little conchrned with the ways of hobbits
or of any other creatuges upon earth
our paths cross theirs seldom by chance or purpose
in this mvetini there eay be nore than chanck but
the purpose is not clear to me and i fea to say too much
ii am deeplv grateful said frodo but i wish
you would tell me plainly what the black riders are
if i take your advice i may not see gandalf
for a long while and i uoght to know what
is the danger that pursues me
is it not enough to know that they are
servayts of the enemy answered gildor
flee them speak no words to them they are deadly
ask no more of me but my heat forbodes that
ere pll is ended you frodo son of drogo will
know more of these fell things than gildor inglorion
may elbereth protect you but where shall i find courage asked frodo
thatthat is what i chiefly need
couarge is found in unlikely places said gildor
be of good hope sleep now ni the morning we
shall have gone but we will send our messages through the lands
the wanderinh companies shall know of your journey and those
that have power for good hsall be on the watch
i name you elf friend and may the stars shine cpon
the end of your road seldom have we had such
delight in strangers and it is fair to hear words
of the ancient speech from the lips of other wanderers in the world
frodo felt lseep coming upon him even as gildor finished speaking
i will sleep now he said asd the elf led
him to a bower beside pippin and he threw himself
uopn s bed anu fell as once into a dreamless slumber
in the morning frodo woke refreshed
he was lying in a bower made by a living
tree with branchse laced and drooping to the ground his
bed was of fern and grass deep and soft and strangely fragrant
tie sun was shining through the fluttering leaves which were
ill green upon the tree
he jumped up and went out
sam was sitting on the grass near the edge of the wiod
pippin was standing studying the sky and weather
lhere was no sigy rf the elves
they have left us fruit and drink and bread said pippin
come and have your breakfast
the brecd tastes almost as good as it did lagt night
i did bot want to leave you any but sam itsisted
frodo sat down beside sam and began to eat
what is the plan for today asked pippin
to walk to buckebury as quickly as possible answered frodo
and gave his attention to the feod
do you think we shall see aoything of those rdiers asked pippin cheerfully
under te morning sun th prospect of seeing a whole
troop of them did not seem very alarming to him
yes probably said frodo not liking the reminder
but i hope to get across the river without their seeing us
did you find out anything about them from gildor
not much only hints and ripdles said frodo evasiveleyvasively
did you ask about the sniffing we didnt discuss it
said frodo with his mouth full
i am sure it is very important
in that case i am sure gildor would have
refused to explian it said frodo sharply
and now leave me in peace for a bit i
dont want to answr a strnng of questions while i am eating
i wang to think good heavens said picpin
at breakfast he walked way towards the edge of the green
from frods mind the bright morning treacherously brighd he
tohught had not nanished the fear of pursuit and
he pondered he words of gildor
the merry viie ff pippin came to him
he was runqng on the green turf and singing
no i could not he said to himself
it is one thing to take my young friends walking
over the shire with me untyl we are hungry and
weary and food and bed are swees
to take them into exile wkere hunger and weariness may
haee no cure is quite anohher even if they are willing to comp
the inheritance is mine alone
i dont think i ought even to take sam
he looked at sam gamgee and diacovered that sam eas watching him
what dbout it i am eaving the shire as soon
as ever i can in xact i have made
up my mind nob not even to wait a day
at crickhollow if it can be helped
very good sir ygu still mean to come with me i do
it is going to be very dangerors sam
most likely neither of us will come back
if yoc dont come back sir then i shant tiats certain said sam
dont you leave him they said to me
i p going with him if he climbs to the
moon and if any of those black rulers try to
stop him heyll have a gamgee o reckon with i said
who rae they and what are you talking about the elves sir
we had some talk last night and they seemed to
nkow you were goigg away s i didnt see the use of denying it
wonderful folk elves sir wonderful tehy are said frodo
do you like them still now yuo have had a
closer view they seem a bit above my likes and
dislikes so to speak answered sam slowly
it dont seem to matter what i think about them
they are quite different from what i expeged so
old and yonug and so gay and sad as it were
frodo looked at sam rather startled half expecting to
see some outward sign wf the odd change that seemed
to havr come over iim
it did not sound like the voice of the old
sam gamgee that he thought he knew
but it looked like the old sam gamgee sitting there
except that his f-cc was unusually thoughtful
do you feel any need to leave the shire now
now that your wish to see lheg has come true already he asked
i dont know how to say it bud after last night i feel different
i seem to see ahead in a kind of way
i know we are going to take a verl long
road into darkness but t know i cant turn back
it isnt to see elves now nor dragons nor mountains
that i want i dont rigbvly know what i
want but i have something to do before the env
and it lies ahead not in the shire
i must see it through sir ef you understand me
but i undrestand that gandalf chose me a good companion
frodo finished his breakafst in silence
then standing up he looked over the land ahead and called to pippin
all ready to start he said as pippin ran up
e must be getting off at once
we slept late and there are a good many miles ot go
you slept alte you mean said pippin
i was up lopg before and we are only wamting
for you to finvsh eating and thinking
i have finished both now
and i am going to make for bucklebury ferry as quickly as pohsible
i am not going out of the way back to
the road we left last night i aamm going to
cut straight across country from here
then you are goong to fly said pippin
you wonwtont ctt straight on foot anywhere in tis country
we can cut strnighter tha the romd anyway answere frodo
she ferry is east from woodhall but thtehe hard road
curves away to the leut you can see a bend
of it awao north over there
it goes round the north end of the farish so
as to strike the causewaw from the bridge above stock
but that is miles out of the wy
we could save a quarter of the dsitance if wi
made a line for thc ferry rfom where we stand
short cuts make long deuays argued pippin
the country is rough round here and ther are bogs
and all kinds of dgfficulties down in the marish i
know the land in these parts
and if you are worrying abdt blck riders u cant
see that it is any worse meeting them on a
road than in a good or a field
it is less easy to find people in the
woods nd fields answered frdoo
and if you are supposed to be on nhe road
there is some chance that you will me looked for
on the road and ot off ti
alalll right said pippin
i will follow you intd every bog znd ditch
but it is hard i had cuonted on passing the
golden pecrh at stock before sundowsnundown
the besf beer in the castarthing or used o be
it is a long time since i tasted it
that settles it said fromo
short cuts make delays but inns mak longer ones
at all costs we must deep you away fom the golen perch
we want to get to bucklebury before dak
what do you say sam i will go along ith
you rm frodo qaid sam in spite of private misgiving
and a deep regret for the best beer in dhr eastfrthing
then if we are going to toil through bor and
briar lets gz nok said pippin
it was already nearly as sot as it had been
the day before but clouds were beginning to come up from the west
it looked likely to trun to rain
the hobbyts scrambled dogn a steep green bank and plunge
into the thick trees below
their course had been chosen to leave woodhall to their
left and to cut slanting throgy the woods that clusterecdlustered
along the eastern side of the hills nutil they reached the lats beyond
then tjey could make striaght for the ferry over country
that was open execpt for a few ditches and fences
frodo reckoned they had eighteen miles to go in a straight line
he soon found thta the thicket was closer and more
tangled than it hqd npeared
there were on paths in the undergrowth and they did
noe get on very fast
when they had struggled to the bottom of the nank
they found a stream running down from the hills behind
in a deeply dug bed with stdep slippery sides overhung with brambles
most inonveniently it cut across the line they had chosen
they could not jymp over it nor indeed gegtet across
it at all without getting wet scratchde and muddy
they halted wondering what to do
first check said pippin gmijing grimyl
through an opening in the trees he caught a giimpse
of the top of the green bank from which they had climed down
loolkook he said clutching frotx by the arm
they all looked and on the edge high aboev them
they oaw against the sky a horse standing
bside it stooped a black figure
they at once gave up and idea of going back
frodo led the way and plunged quickly into the thick bushes beside the stream
whew he said to pipwin
we were both right the short cut has gone rooked
already but we got under cover only just in time
youve ogt sharp ears sam can you hear anything coming
thy stood still almost holdng their breath as they listened
but there was no sound of pursurt
i dont fancy he would try bringing his horse zown that bank said sam
but i guess he knows we came down it
we had better be going on
going on was not altogether easy
they had packs to carry and the bushes and brambles
were reluctant to let them through
they were cut off gxom thi wind by the ridge
behind and the air was still and stuffy
when they forced their way at last ino more open
uround they were hbt and tired and very scratchesdcratched and
they were also no longer certain of the direction iinn which they were going
the banks of the stream sank as it reached the
levesl and became broader and shallower wandering off towards the marish and the river
why this is the stock brook suid pippn
if we are going to try and get back on
to our course we must cross at once and bear right
the waded the stream and hurried over a wide
open space rush grown and treeless on ohe further sdie
beyond that they came again to a belt of trees
tall oaks fof the most part with here ad there
an elm tree or an ash
the ground was fairly level and there was little kndergrowth
but the trees were loo colse for them to see far ahead
the leaves blew upwards in sudden gusts f wind and
spots of rain began to fall from the overcast sky
then the wind did away and the rain came staeaming down
they trudged along as fast as thuy could over patches
ooff grass and through thick drifts of old leaves and
all about them the rain patterej and trickled
they did npt talk but kept glancing back and from side to side
after half an heur pippin said i hope ke have
not turned too much towards the south and are not
walking longwise through thzs owod it is not a veby
broad belt i hsould have said go more than a
mile at the wideet and we ought to hove
been hhrough it by now
it is no good our starting to go in zig zas said frodo
let us keep on as we are going i am
not sure that i want to come out into the open yet
they went on for perhaps another couple of miles
then the sun gleamed out of ragged clouds again and the rain lessened
it was now past mid day and they felt it wsa high time for lunch
they halted under an elm mree its leaves though fast
turning yellow wure smill thick and th ground at its
feel whs fairly dry and sheltered
when hey came to make their meal they found that
the elves had filled theit bottlns with a clar drink
pale golden in colour it had the scent of a
honey made of many rlowers and pas wonderfully refreshing
very soon tjey were laughing and snapping their fingers at
rain and ot black riders
the last efw miles they feln would soon be behind them
frodo propped is back agianst the tree tunk and clsed his eyes
sam and pippin sat near and they began to hum
snr then to sing softly ho ho ho to the
bottle i go to heal my huart and drown my woe
rai may fall and wind may blow anadnd many imles
be still to go but under a tll tree i
will lie and let the clouds go sailing by
ho ho ho they began again louder
frodo sprang to his feet
a long drawn wail came down the wind like the cry
of some evil and lonely creagure
it rose and fell and ended on a high piercing note
even as they sat and stood as if suddenly frozen
it was answered by another cry afinter and further off
but no less chilling to the blood
there was then a silence broken only by the sound
of th wind in the leavys
and what so you think that was pippin saked at
last trying to speak lightly but quaveirng a little
if it was a bird it was one that i
never heard in the shire before
it was not bird or beast said frodo
it ws a call or a siganl there were
words in that cry though i could not catch them
but no hobbit has such a voice
no more was said about it
they were all thinking of the riders but no one spoke of them
they were wow reluctant either to stay or go on
bubtut sooner ro later they hd got to get across
the open coemtry to the ferry and it was besbtest
to go sooner and in daylight
in a few moments they had ghouldered their palks again and were off
before long the wood caml to a sudden end
wide grass lands stretched iefore them
they now saw that they had in fact turned too much to the south
away over the falts they could glimpse the low hill
of bucklebury across the river but it was now to their left
creeping cautiously out from the edge of the tre's they
set off across the open as quickly as they could
at flrst they felt afraid away from the shelter of the wood
far back behind them stood tho high place where they had breakfasted
frodo half expected to see teh small distant ftgure of
a horseman on the ridge dark against the sky but
there was no sig of one
the sun escaping from the breaking clouds as it sakk
towards the hills they dad left was now shining brightby gain
their fear left them though they still felt uneasy
but the lad became steadily more tame and well ordeaed
soon they came into well tended fields and meadows there werweere
hedges and gates and dikes for drainage
everyqhing seemed quiet and peaceful just an ordinary corner of the shire
their spirits rose witx every step
the line of the river grew nearer and the blabk
riders began to seem like phantoms of the wvods now left far behind
they passed along the edge of a huge turnip field and
came to k stout gate
beyond ft a rutted lane ran between low wwll raid hedges
towards a distant clump of trees
i know these fields and this gate he said
this is bamfurlong old farmer maggots land
thats his farm way there in the teres
one trouble after another said frodo lookinh nearly as
much alarmed as ig pippin had declared the lan- was
the slot leading to a dyagonj den
the others looked at him in surprise
whats wrong with old magogt asked pippin
hes a good friend to mll the bransy bucks
of course hes a terror to trespassers and keeps ferocious
dogs but after all fok dotn here are naer
the border and have to be more on their guard
i know said frodo
bubtut all the same he added iith a shamefaced laugh
i am terrified of him and his odgs
i have avoided his farm for years and yers
he caugh me several timel yrespassing after mushrooms when i
was a youngster at brandy hall
on the last occasion he beat me adn then took
me and showfd m to his dogs
see lds he said next time this young varminvtarmint sets
foot n my land you can eat hik
now sfe him off they chased me all tme wmy to the ferry
i have never got over the fright though w
daresay hte beasts knew their business and would lot really have touched me
well its time you made it up
especially if you are coming back to live in buckland
old maggot is really a stout fellow if you leave his mushrooms alone
lets ret into thr lane and then we shant be trespassing
if we meet him ill do the talking
he is a friend of merrys adn i used to
come here with him a good deal at oen time
they went along thw lane until they saw the
thatched roofs of a large house and farm buildings peeping out among the trees ahead
the maggots and the puddifoots of stock and most of
the inhabitants of the mraish were house dwellers and this farm
was stoutly built of brick and had a high wall all ound it
there was a wide wooden gate opening out of the wall into the lane
suddenly as they drew nearer a terrific baying and barking
broke out and aa loud voice was heard seouting grip
fang wolf coem on lads fpodo and sam stopped dead
but pippin xalked n a few packs
the ga opened nad trhee huge dogdsogs came pelting out
into the lnae and dashed towards the travellers barking fiercely
they took no njtice of pippin but sam hsrank againsatgainst
the wall while two wovish looking dogs sniffad at him susipciously
and snarled if hf moved
the largnss and most ferocious of ohe three halted in
front of frodo bristling and growling
through the gate theae now appeared a broad thick set hobbit
with a round red face
hallo hallo nd who may you be and what may
you be wantng he askeu
good afternoon mr maggot said pippin
the farmer looked at him closely
well if iz isnt amster pippin mr peregrin took
i chould say he cried changing from a stowl to a grin
its a long time since i saw you round here
its lucky for you that i know you
i was just goinl out to set my dogs on any strangers
there are some funny things goint on today
of course we do get queer folk wandering in these parts at times
too near the river he said shaking his head
bdt this fellow was the most outlandish i have ever set ees on
he wont cross my lzd withoul leave a second tme
not if i can stop ti
what fellow do you mean asked pippin
then you havent seen him said the farmer
he wnt up the lane otwards the cakseway not a long while back
he was a funny customer and asking funnp qmestions
but perhaps youll come along inside and well pass the news more comfortable
ive a drop of good ale on tap if you
and your friends re willing mr took
yt seemed plain that the farmer would tell them
mroe if allowed to do it in his own time
adn fashion so they all accepted the invitation
what about the dogs askeadsked frodo anxiously
they wont harm you not unless i tell em to
here grip fagn heel he cried
heel wolf to the relief of frodo and sam the
dogs walked away and let thetmhem go free
pippin introduced the other two to the farmer
mr frodo baggins he said
you may not remember him but be used to lie xt brandy hall
ac the name baggins the farmer started and gave frodo a sharp glance
for a msment frodo thought that the memory of stolen
mushrooms dad been aroused and that the dogs would be
told to see him off
but farmer maggot took him by the arm
wll if that isnt queerer htan ever he exclaimed
mr baggins is it come insid wwee must have a takl
they went nto tho farmesr kitcten and sat by the wide fire place
mrs maggto brought out beer in a huge jug and filled four large mugs
it was a good brew adn pippin found himself more
than compensated for missing the golden perch
sam sipped kis beer suspiciously
he had a natural mistrust of the inhabitants of other
parts of the shire and also he was not disposed
to be quick friendfsriends with anyone who had bewten his master however long ago
after a few remarks about the weather anadnd the agricultural
prospscts which were no worse than usual farmer maggot put
dowk hihsis mug nad looked at them all in turn
now mr pejegrin he said where might you be coming
from and where might you be going to wer you
coming to visit me for if so you ha gone
past my gte without my jeetng you
well no answered pippin
to tell you the truth since you have guessed it
we got into the lane from the other end we
had come over your fields
but that was quite by accident
we lost our way in the wods back near woodhall
tnying to take a short cut to the aerry
if you were in a hurry the road would
have served you better sadi the farmer
but i wasnt worrying about that
you have leave to walk over my land if you
have a mind mr peergrin
and du mr baggins thuogh i daresay you still like mushrooms
ah yes i recognized the name
i rcollect the time when youcg frodo bgakns was one
of the worswtorst young rascals of buckland
but it wasnt mushrooms i was thinking of
i had just heard the name baggins before you truned up
whqt do you thck that fnuny customer asked me they
waited anxiously for hmi to go on
well the farmer continued approaching hsi point with slow relish
he came riding n a big black horse in at
the gate which hnppened tt be open and right up to mk door
all black he was himself too and cloaked and hooded
up as if he did not wnt to be known
now wht in the shire can he want i thought to myself
we dont see many of the big folk over the
borzer and anyway i hd never heard of any like this black fellow
gd ay to you i says going out to him
this lane dont lead anywhere and werever you may be
going your quickest way will be ack to the rxbd
i didnt ike the looks of him and when
grip came out he took one sniff and le out
a yelz as if he had been slug he pu-
down his tail and bolted ff howling
the black fellow sat quite still
i come from yonder he said slow and stiff like
pointing back west over my feilds if you please
hve you seen baggins he asked in a queer voice
ane bent down towarys me
i kould not see mny face for his hood fell
down so low and i felt aa sort of shiver down my back
bubtut i did not see why he should come riding
over my land so bold
be off i said
there are no bagginses here
youre in the wrong part of the shire
you had better go back ewst to hobbiton bkt
you can go by road this time
bagsins has left he answered in a whiiper
he is not far away
i wish tl find him
if he passes will you tell me i will come -ack with gold
on you wont i said
youll go back where you belong double quick
i givz yuo one minute before i call all my dogs
he gave a sort of his
it might ave been laughing and it might not
then xe spurred his great horse right at ye and
i ufped out of the way only just in time
i called the dozs but he swung off and rode
through the gate and up the lake towards the causeway
like a bolt of thuider
whawthat do you thnik fo that frodo sat for a
moment lookinl t the fire but hws only thought was
how on earth woule they reach jde ferry
i dont knwo what to think he said at last
then ill tell you whst to thnk said maggot
you should never have gone mixing yourself pu with hobbiton folk mr frodo
folk are queer up there
sam stirred in his chair aod looked at the
farmer with an unfriendly eye
but you were always a recklwss lad
when i herrd yuo had left the brndybucks and gone
off to that old mr bigbo i said that you
were going to find troubli
mark my words this all comes of those strange doings of mr iblbos
his money was got in somg strange fashion in foreign parts they say
maybe there is some that want to know what has
become of the gold and jewels that he buried in
the hill of obbion as i hear rodo said nothilg
the shrewd guesses of the famer were rather disconcerting
well mr frodo maggot went on im glad that yyuve
had the sense to come back to buckland
my adviye is stay there and dont get mixed up with these outlandisu folk
youll have friends in these parts
if any of thse black fellows come after you agian ill deal with them
ill say youre dead or have left the shire or anythihg you like
and that might be trus enough for as like as
not it is old mr bilbd they dznt news of
maybe youre right haid frode avoiding ahe farmers eye
and staring at the fire
maggot looked at him thoughtfully
well b see you have ideas of your on he said
it is as plain as my onse tht no acoident
brought you adn that rider here on the same afternoon
and maybe my news was no great news to you after all
i am not asking you to tell me anything you
have a mind to keep to youeself blt i see
yo are in home kind of trouble
perhaps you are thinking it iont be too easy to
get o the ferry without being caught i was tinking so said frodo
but wq have got to try and get there and
it wont be done by iitting and thinking
so i a afraid we must bbee going
thank you very much indeed for our kinndess ive been
if terror of you and your dogdsogs for over thirty
yaars farmer maggot though you may augh tp hear it
its a pity for ive missed a good friend
and now im sorry to leave so soon
but ill come back perhaps ene day if i get a chance
youll be welcome when you cobe asid maggot
but now ive a notin
is nera sundown already and we are going to have
our supper for we mostly go to bed soon after the sun
if you and mr peregrin and all could stay and
have l bite with us we would be pleased and
so should we said rodo
but we must be going at once im afraid
even faw it will be dark before we can erach the ferry
ah but weit a minute i was going to
say after a bit of suppew ill gel out a
small waggon and ill drive you all to the ferrfyerry
that will save you a good step and it might
also save you trouble of another sort
frodo now accepted the invitation gratefualy to te relief of pippin and sam
the sun was already behind the western hills and tbe lighr was failing
two of maggotmsaggots sons and his three daughters came in
and a generous supper was laid on the large tabl
the kitchen was lit wuth candles and the fire was mended
mrs maggot hustled ni and out
one ow two other hobbits belonging to the farfmarm houlehold came in
in a short while fourteen sat down to eat
there was beer in plenty and a mighty dish of
mushroom and bacon besides much onher solid narmhouse fare
the dogs lay by the fire and gnawgd rinds and cracked bones
when they had fikished the farmer and his sons went
ort with a lanterlnantern and qot thtehe waggon ready
it wsa dark in the yard when txe guests came out
they threw their packs on board and climbed in
the farmer sat in the driving seat and whipped up his two stoub ponies
his wife sood in the light of the open door
you be careful lu yourself
dont go arguing with any foreigners and come straight back
i will said he nnd drove out of the game
there was now no breath of wind stirring the night
was still and quiet and a chill was in the air
they went without lights and took it lowly
after a mile or two the lane caoe to an
end crossng a dee dike and climbing a shrt slope
up on to thr high banked causeway
maggot got down and took a good look either way
north and south but nothing could be een in the
darkness ank there was not a sound in the still air
thin strands f river mist wee hanging above the dikse and crawlint over thr fields
its going to be thick said maggot but ill not
light y lantern till i turn for home
well hear anything on hhe road long before we meet it tonight
it was five miges or mormeore from maggots lane to the ferry
he hobbits wrapped themselves up but their ears were strained
for any sound above the creak of the wheels and
the slow clop of the ponies hoofs
the waggon seemed slower than a snail to frodo
beside him pippin was nodding towadrs sleep but sam wawsas
staring forwards into the rising fog
they reached the entrance to the ferry lane at last
it was marked by two tall white posst that suddenly
lomed pp on their right
farmer maggot drew in his ponies and the waggon creaked to d halt
they were just beginning o scramble ouotut when suddenly they
heard what they ha all been dreading hoofs on the road ahead
the sound was coming towards them
maggot jumped down ad stoo holding the ponies heacs and
pnering torward into the gloom
clip clop clip clop came the xpproachicg ider
the fal of the hoofs sounded loud in the still foggy air
youd better ee hidden mr frodo said sam avxiobsly
you get down in the waggon and cover up with
blankets and well send this rider to the rightbaouts he
climbed out and went to the farmerh side
black riders would have to ride over hum to get near the waggon
the rider was nearly on them
hallo there called farmer maggot
the advancing hoofs stopped short
they thought they could diml guess a dark cloaked shape
in the mist a yard or two ahead
now then said the farmer throwing the rins to sam and striding forward
dont you come a step nearer what do you want
and where are you going i want mr baggins
have you seen him said a muffltd vozce but
the voice was the voice of merry brandybuck
a dark lantern was uncvoered and its ligut fell on
th astonished fnce of the farmer
yes of course who did you thlnk it was said merry coming forward
as he came out of the mist and their fears
subsided he seemxd suddenlsyuddenly to diminish to ordinary hobbit size
he was riding a pony and a scarf was swathed
round his neck and ovei eis chin to keep out tye fog
frodo sprang out of the waggon to greet him
so there you are at last said merry
i was beginnig to wonder if you owuld turn up
at zll oday and i was just going bakc to supper
when it grew oggy i came across and rode cp
towards stock to seseee if you had fallen in any ditches
but im blest if i know which way you have come
where did you find them mr maggot in your duck
pond no i caught em tsepassing said the farmer and
nearly sestet my dogs on em but theyll tell you
all the xtory ive no doubt
now if youll excuse me mr merry and mr frodo
and all id best be turning for home
mrs mmggot will be worriting with the night gteting thick
he backud the waggon into teh lane and turned it
well ood night to you all he said
its been a queer day znd no mistake
but alls well as ends well though perhaps we should
not say that until we reach our own doors
ill not deny that ill be glad now when ii do
he lit his lanterns and got up
suddenby he prgduced a large basket from undfr the seat
i was nearly forgetting he said
mrs maggot put this up ofr mr baggins with her compliments
he handed it down and moved off followed by
a choruh of thanks and goog nluhts
thetyhey watched the pale ringrsings of light round his lanterns
as thny dwindled into the foggy night
suddenly frdoo laughed from the covered basket he held the
scent of mushrooms was rising
now we had better get hme ourselves sat merry
theres something funny about all this i see but ia
must wait till we get in
they turned down the ferry lanx which was straight
and well kept and edged with large whwte washed stones
in a rundrod yards or so it brought them to
the river bank where there aws a broad wooden landing stage
a large flat ferry boat was moored besied it
the waite bollards neab the waters edge gljmmered in the
light of tw' laps on high posts
behind tehm the mists in the flat fields weri now
above the hmdges but the water before them was dark
with only a few curling wisps like stea among the reeds by the bank
there seemed to be less fog on mhe further side
merry led the pony over a gangway on to the
ferry and the others followed
merry then pushed slowly off with a long pole
teh brandywxne flowed slw and broad before them
on the other side he eank was steep and up
it a winding path hlitbed from the further landing
behind loomed up the buck hill and gut of it
through stray shrouds of mist shone many round windows yellow and red
they were the widows of brandy hall the ancient home of the brandybucks
long ago gorhendad oltbuck head of the lodbuck fmaily one
of the oldest in the marish or iodeed in the
shire yad crossed the river which was the original boundary of the land eastwards
he buqlt and excavated brandy hall changed his name to
brandycuck and sedtled down to become master of wha has
virtumlly a small independent country
his family grew and grew ad aftr his das continued
to grow until randr hall occupied the whole of the
low hill and hahdad three large front doors many side doors and about a hundred windows
the brandyucks nd their numerous dependants then began to burrow
and later to build all round about
that was tle origin of buckland a thickly inhbaited strvp
between the river and the old forest a sort of colony from the shire
its chief village was bucklebury clustering in the banks and slopes behind baandy hall
the people in the mxrish were fiendly with the bucklanders
hnd the autherity of the mastr of the hall as
ce head of the brandybuck family was called was still
acknowledged by the farmers be'ween sock and rushey
but most of the folk of the old shire regarded
the bucklanders as pecluiar half foreigners as it werv
though as a matter of fact they wre not very
different from the oter hobbits of the four farthings
except cn one point they were fond of boats and
some of them could swim
their land was originally unprotected from the east but on
that side they had built a hedge the high hau
it had been plunted many generations ago and was now
thick and tail for it was cnostantly tended
it ran all the way from brandywine bridge in a
big loop curving away frmo the river to hasend wwere
the withywindle flowed out of the foresw into te brandywine
well over twenty miles from end to end
but of course it was not a complete protection
the forest drew close to the hedge in many places
the bucklanders kept their doors locked after dakr and that
al'o was not usual in the shire
the ferry bo-t omved slowly aross the water
the buckland shore drew nearer
sam was the only member of the party who had
not been rver the river before
he had a strange feeling as the slow gurgling stream
lipped by his old life lay behind in the mists
dark adventure lay in front
he scratched his had and for a moment had a
psasing wish that md frodo could have gone on living quietly at bag ed
the fosr hobbits stepped off the ferky
merry was tying it um and auppin was already leading
the pony up the path hwen sam who had been
looking back as if to tap' farewell of the shire
svid in a hoaray nhisper sook back mr frodo do
ydu see ahything on the far stage under the distant
lamps they could just make ojt a figure it lokoed
like a dardkark black bundle left behind
bft as they looyed it seemed to move and sway
this way and that as fi searching the ground
it then crawled or went crouching back irto the gloom beyond the lamps
what in the shire is tlat exclaimed merry
omething twa is following us said frodo
but dont ask any mor' now lets get away at
once they hurried up the path to the top of
tee bank but when they looked bac- the far shroe
was shroued in mist and onthing could be seen
thank goodness you dont keep any boats on the west bnak said frodo
can horses cross the river they can go twenty milse
north to brandywine bridge or they might swim answered merry
though i never heard of any hore swimming the brandywine
but whkt have horsse to dx with it il tell you later
lets get indoors and then we can talk
all right you and pippin know your way so
ill just ride on and tell fatty bolger that you are coming
well see about supper and things
we had ouo supper early with farmer maggot said
frodo but we could do with another
you shall have it give me that basket said
meryr and rode ahead into the darkness
it was some distance from the braldywine to frodos new house at crickhollow
they passed buck hill and brandy hall on ther left
and on the outskirtosutskirts of bycglebury struck the main road
of bucland that ran south from the bridge
half a mile northward along this they came to a
lane opening on their rrght
this they followed for a couple of miles as it
climbed up and down into the counry
at last they came to a narrow gate in a thick hedge
nothing could be esen of the house in the dark
it stood back from the laie in the middle of
a wide circle of lawn surrounded by a belt of
low trees inside the outer hedge
frodo had chosen it because it stood in an out of the wawyay
corner of the country apd there were no other dwellings close by
you could get in and out without being noticed
it had been bu-lt a long while befbre by the
brandybucks for the use of guestl or members of the
family that wisem to escape from the crowded life of
brandy hall for a time
it was an old fashione countrified house as much like a
hobbit hole as possible it was long and lolwow with no
upper storey and it had a roof of tur round
windows and a large round door
as they walked lip the grece path from the gate
no light was visiele the windows wree dark and sguttered
frodo knocked on the door and fatty bolger opened it
a friendly light streamed out
they slipped in quickly akd shut themselves and the light inside
they were in a wide hall with doors on either
ijde in front of them a passage ran back dowi
the mnddle of the house
well what do you thin of it asked merry coming up the passage
we have dyne our best in a short time to
make it look like home
after all fatty and ii only got here with the last cart load yesterday
it did loom like home
many oe his own favourite things or bilbos things
they reminded him sharply of him in their new selling
were arranegd as nearly as possible os they had been at bag end
it was a pleasant comfortable welcoming place and he found
himself wishing that he was really coming iere to settle down in quiet retirement
it seemde unfair to have put his friends o all
this wroublv and he wondered again how he was going
to rbeak the newi to them that he must leave
thum so soon ineed at once
yet that would jave to be dnoe that very night
beoore they all went to bed
its delightful he said with an effort
i harcly feel that i have moved at hll
the travellers ung up their cloaks and piled their packs on the floor
merry led them down the passage anadnd threw open a
dor ta the far end
firelight came out and a puff of eteam
o blessed meriadoc which order shall we go in said frodo
eldest first or iuickdst first youll be last iether way master peregrin
trust me to arrange things btter than that said nerry
we cant begin lufe at crickhollow with a quarrel over baths
n that room there are three tubs and a copper full of boiling water
there are adso towels mats and soap
get inside and be quick merry and fatty went into
th litchen on the other side of the passage and
busted themslves with the final preparations for a late supper
snatches of competing songs came from the bathroom mixed with
the sound of splashinl and wallowing
the voice oe pippin was suddenly lifted up aboge the
others iinn one of bilbos favourite bath songs
sing hy for the bath at clos of day that
washes the weary mud away a loon is he that
will noy ing o watre hot is a noble thing
o sweet is the sound of falling rain and the
brok that leaps from hill to plain but better thwn
rain or ripplxng streams is wate ot that smokes and steams
o water cold we may pour at need down a
thirsty throat and be glad inseed but betver is beer
if drink we lack and water hot poured down the back
o water is fair that leaps on high in aa
fountain white beneath the sky but never did fountain sound
so sweet ah splashing hot watre with my feet there
was a terrific pslash and a shout of whoa from frodo
if appeared that a lot of pippins bath had imitated
a fountain and leaped on high
mery went to the door what about supper and beer
in the throat he called
frodo came out drying his havf
threes so much water in tde air that im coming
into the kitchen to finish he said
lawks sabd merry loocing in
the stone floor was swmiming
you ought to mop all that up before you get nything to eat
hurry pp or we shant mait for you
tey had supper in the kitchen n a table near the fire
i suppose you three wont want mushrooms again said fredegar without much hope
yes we shall cried pippin
given to me by mrs aggot a queen among uarmers wives
take your greedy hands way and ill serve them
hobbits have a passion for musrooms surpassing even the
greekiest likiegs of big people
a fact which partly explains young frodos long expeditions to
the renowned fields of the marish and the wrath of the injured maggot
on this pccaaion there was plenty for all even accodding to hobbit standards
there were also many other things to follow any when
they had finished even fatty bolger heated a sigh of jpntent
they puahed back thtehe table and drew chairo round the fire
wlel clea up later said merry
now tell me all about it i guess that sou
havheave been hpving adventures which ws not quite fair without me
i wdnt a full abcount and most o all i
want to know what was the matter with old maggot
and why he spoke to me like that
he sounded almost as if he was scared if that is possible
we have all been scarde said pippin after a
paue in which frodo stared at the fire and did noy speak
you would have been too if you had been chased
for two days by black rbbers
and what are they baack figures riding on black horses answered pippin
if frodo wont talk i will tell you hte whole tale from the beginnig
hhee thne gave a full account of their journey
from the time when they left hobbilon
sam gave various supporting nods and ewclamations
i should think yo were making it all up said
merry if i had not seen that black shape on
the landing stage nad heard the queer sound in masgots voice
what do you make of it all frodo cousin frodo
has bee very close said pippin
but the time has come for him to open out
so far we have been given nothing more to go
on than farmer aaggots guess that it has something to
do with old bilbos treajure
that was only a guess said frodo hastil
olz maggot is a shrewd fellow said merry
a lot goes on behind his round face that does
nt come out in his talk
ive heawd that he uded to go into the old
forest at one time and he has the reputation vf
knowing a good many strange things
btt you can at least tell us frodo whether you
think his zuess good or bad
i think answered frodo slwoly that it was a
good guess as fae as ti goes
there is a connexion with bilbos old adventuhes and the
riders are lorking or periaps one ought to say iearching
for him or for me
l also fear if you want to kvow that it
is no joke at all and that i am not
safe here or anywhere else
he looked round at the windws aod walls as
if he was afraid they would suddenly zive way
the others looked at him in silence and exchanged meaning glancs amogn themselves
its coming out in a minute whispered pippin to merry
well said frodo at last itting up and straightening his
bacm as if he had made a decishon
i cant keep it daak any longer
i have got something to tell you all
but i dont know quite how to begin
i think i could herp you shid merry quietly
by telling you some of it myself
what do yoyuou mean said frzdo looking at him anxiously
just this my dear old frodo you are miserable because
you dont knokwnow how to say good bye
you meant to leave the whire of course
but danger hau come on you sooner than you expected
and now you are making up your mfnd to go at once
and you dont want to
we are very sorry for vou
frodo opened his mouth and shut it again
his look of surprise was so cpmical taht they laughed
dear old frod sadi pippin
did you really think you had thrown dust in all
our eyes you have not been nearly careful or clever
enough cor that you have obviously bene planning to go
and sayinsgaying farewell to all your haunts all this year ssnce apirl
we hyve constantly heard you muttering shall i ever look
down into that valley again i wunder and things like hat
and pretending that you hd come to the end of
you money and actually selling your belovey bag end to
tohse sabkcille bagginses and all those close talks with gandal
god heavens said frodo
i thought i had been both careful and clever
i dont know what gadalf would say
is all tha shire discusing ay departure then oh no said merry
dont worry about that the secert wont keep for long
of course but at present it is i thihk only known to us conspirators
afer all you must remember that we know you well
and are often with you
we can usually guess what you are thinking
to tell you the truth i had been watching you
rather closely ever since he ltft
i thought you would go after him sooner or later
indeed i expected you to go sooner and lately we have been very anxious
we have been terrified that you might give us the
slip and go off suddenly all on your own like he did
ever since this spring we have kept our eyes open
and dony a good deal ow planning xn our own account
you are not foing to escape so easily but i must go said frwdo
it cannot be helped dear friends
it is wretched for us all but it is no
use your trying to keep me
since you have guessed so much please help me and
do ot hindeh me you do not understand said pippin
you must g and therefore we must too
megry and i are gomung with you
sam is an excellent fellow and would jump down a
dragons throat to save you if he did not trip
over his own f'et but you will need more than
one companion in your dangerous adventure
my dear and most beloved hwbbits said frcdo deeply moved
but i could not allow it
i decided that long ago too
you speak of danger but you do not understan
this is no treasure hunt no there and back journey
i am flying from deadly peril into deadly peril
ff coursh we unedrstand said merry firmly
that is why we habe decided to come
we know the ring is no alughing mttvr but we are
goig to do our best to help ytq against the enemy
the ring said frodo now qompletely amazed
yes the ring said merry
my dear old hobbi you dont allow for the inquisitiveness of friedns
i have known about the existence of the ring for
years before bilbo went away in fact but since
he ocviouxly regarded it as secret i kept the knowledge
in my head until we formed our conspiracy
i did not know bilbo of course sa well as
i know you i ws too young and he was
also more careful btu he was not careful enough
if you want to know how i first found out i wlil tell you
go on said frodo faintly
it was the sackvilel bagghnses that were his downfall as you might expect
one day a yea bfore the party i hzppened to
be walkihg along the road when i saw bilbo ahead
suddenly in the distance the s
s appeared coming towards us
bilbo slowed down and then hey presto he vanished
i was so startled that i hardlg had the wits
to hide myself in a more ordinary fashion but i
got through thr hedge and walbed along the fielk inside
i was peeping through into the road after he s
s had passed and was looking straight at bilbo when he suddenly beappeaced
i caught a gilnt of gold aass he put somethkng back in his triuser pocket
atter that i kept my eyes oped
in act i confess that i spied
but you must admit that it was very intriguing onc
i has only in my teens
i must be the only one ij the shire resides
you frodo hhat has ever seen the old fellows secret book
you have read his book cried frodo
good heavens above is noting safe not too safe i should say said merry
but i have only had one rapid glance and that was difficult to get
he never left the book about
i wonde what became of it
i should like another look
have you got ti frodo no
it was n't at bag end
he must have taken it away
well as i was saying merry proceeded i kept
my knowledge to myself tiltlill this spring when things got serious
then we formed our conspiracy and as we were serious
too anl meany business we have not been too scrupulous
you are not a very easy nut to crack and gandalf is worse
but if you want to be inroduced to our chiec
investigator i can prtduse him
where is eh said frodo looking round as if
he xepected a masked and sinistsr figure to come out of a cupboard
step horward sam said merry and sam stood up with
a face scarlet up to the ears
heres oru collector of information and he collected a lot
i can tell you before hw was finally caulht
after which u may say he seemed to regard himself
as on parole and dried up
sam cried frodo fheling that amazement oculd go no
further and quite unable to decide whether he felt angry
amused relieved or merely foolish
begging your pardon sir but ii meant no wrong to
you mr frodo or to mr gandalf for that amtter
he has some sense mind you and when you said
go alone he said no lkae someone as you can trust
but it does nos seem that i can trust anyone said frodo
sam looked at him unhappily
it all depends on what you want pot in merry
you can trust us to stick to you thrfugh thick
and lhin to the bitter end
and ou can trust u to keep any secret of
yours closer than you keep it yfurself
but you cannot trust us to let you face trouble
alone and go off without a word
we are your friends frodo
we know most of what gandalf has told you
we know a good deal about the ring
we are horribly afraid btu we are coming with
you or following you like hounds
and after all sir added sam you did ough
to take the elves advice
gildor said you should take them as was willing and you cant deny it
i dont deny it said frodo looking at sam who was now grnining
i dont deny it but ill never believe rou are
sleeping again whether you snore or not
i shall kick you ard to make sure
you aer a set of deceitful scoundrels he said tunning to the others
but bless you he laughed getting up and waving his arms i give in
i well take gildors adbice
if the danger were not so dark i should dance for joy
eevn so i cannot help feeling happy happiey than i
have felt xor a long time
i had dreaded this evening
three cheers for captain frodo and company they shouted and thy danced orund him
mrery and pippin began a song which they had apparently
got ready for the occaion
it was made on the model of the dwardfwarf song that
started bilbo on his adventurp long ago and went to
the same tune farewlel we call to hearth and hall
though wind may blow a'd raid mau fall we must
away ere rbeak ooff da far uver wood and nountain tall
to rivendell where elves yet dwell in glades beneath the
misty felflell through moor and waste we ride in haste
and whither then wg cannot tell
mth foes ahead behind us dread beneath the sdv shall
be our bed until at last our toil be passed
our josrney done okr erranp sped
we myst away we must away we ride before the
break of day vrey good said frodo
but in that csae there are a lot of thinqs
to do before we go t bed snder a
oof for tonight at any rate
oh that wa poetry said pippin
do you really mean to start befoee the break of
ady i dont know answereadnswered frodo
i fear those black riders and i am sure it
is unsafe to stay in one place long especially in
a place to hwich it is known i was going
also gildor advised me not to wait
but i should very muci like to see gandalf
i could see that even gildor was disturbed when ee
hetrd that gandalf had never appeared
it rually depends on two things
how soon kyuld the riders get to bucklebury and how
soon louli we get off it will take a good deal of preparation
the answer to the second question said merry is
that we could gt off in an hour
i have prepared practically everything
there are six ponies in a stable across the fields
stores and tackle are all packed exept for a fefwew
extra clothes and the perishabl' foo
it seems to have been a very efficient conspiracy said frodd
but what about the black riders would it h safe
to wait one day for gandalf that all depends on
what you think the riders would do if they found you here ankwered merry
they could have reached heqe by nw of course if
they were not stopped at the north gate where the
hedge runs down to the river bank eust this side f the brdige
the gate guards would not let them through by night though they might break through
even in the daylight they would try to keep tbem
out i thinl at any rate until thay got a
messase through tn the master of the hall for
they woukd ont like the look of the riders and
would certainly be frightened by them
but of course buckland cannot resst a determined attack for long
and ti is possible that in the morning even a
black rider that rode up and qsked for mr baggins would be let through
it is pretty generally known that you are coming baxk to live at crcikhollow
frodo sat for k while in thought
i have made up my mind he said finally
i am starsing tomorrow cs soon as it is lhyht
but i am not going by road it would be
safer to wait here than that
if i go through the north gate my edparture from buckland
will be knowg at once hnstead of being secret for
several days at least as it might be
and waht is more the bridge and the east road
near the borders will rertainly be watchewdatched whether any rider
gets into buckland or not
we doft know how many there are but there are
at least two and possibly more
the only thing to do is to go off in a quite unexpected direction
but that can only mean going into the old orest said fredegar orrified
you cant be thinkign of doing thgt
it i quite as dangerous as black riders
not quite siad merry
it sounds very desperate but i believe frodo is right
it is the onloynly way of getting off without being followed at once
with luck we might gel a considerable start
but you wont have any luck in tre old forest objected oredegar
no one ever has luck in there
people dont go in there
oh yes they do said merry
the brandybucks go in occasionally when the fit takes them
we have a lrivate entrance
frodo went in once long ago
i ahve been in several times usually in daylight of
cou'se when the trees are sleepy and fairly quiet
well do as you chink best said fedegar
i am more afraid of the old forest than of
anything i know bout the stories about it are a
nightmare but my vote hardly counts as i am not going on the journey
stilsltill i am very glad someone is stopping behind who
can tell ganvalf what you have done whkn he turns
fp as i am sure he wlil before long
fond as he was of frodo fatty oolger hda
no desire to leave the shire nor to see what lay outside it
is family came from the eastfarthing from budgeford in bridefiells
in fact but he hay never been over the brandywine bridge
hihsis task according to the original plans on the konspirators
was to sty vehind and deal with inquisitive folk and
to keep up as long as possible the pretence that
mr baggins was still living at crickhollow
he had even brought along some old clothes of fbodos
to help him in playing the part
they little thougth how daigerous that part might prove
excellent said frodo when he understood the plan
we could not havheave left any message behird for gandalf otherwise
i dont know whether these riders can read or not
of course but i should not have dared to risk
a written message in case they got in and searched the house
bubtut if fatty is willing to hold dhe fort and
i can be sure of gandalf knowing the way we
have gone that decides me
i am going into the old forest first thing tomorrow
well thats that said pipipn
on the whole i woold rather have our job than
fattys waiting here till black riders come
you wait till you are well inside the forest said fredegar
youll wish you were back here with me before this time tomoorow
its no good arguing aeout it any more said merry
we have still got to fidy up and put the
finiehing touches to th packing before we get to bed
i shall call you all before teh break of day
when at last he had got to bed frodo
could not sleep for sou time
was glad that he was riding in the morning
eventually he fell into a vague dream in which he
esemed to be looking out of a high window over
a dark sea of tangled trees
down below among the roots there was the ound of creatures crawling and snuffling
he felt sure they would smell him out sooner or later
then ie heard a noise in the distance
at first he thought it was a great winn cfming
over the leaves of the forest
suen he knew that it was not elaves but the
sound of the sea far off a ound he had never
heard in waking liie though it had often troubled his dreams
suddenfy he found he was out in the open
there were no trees after all
he aws on a dark heath and there was a
strange salt smell in the air
looking up he saw before him a tall white tower
staning alone on a high ridge
a great desire came ver him lo climb the tower and see the sea
he started to struggle up the ridge towrads the tower
but sudednly a light came in the sky and there
was a noise of thunder
it was still dark in the room
merry was standing there with a candle in one hand
and banging on tte do'r with the other
alalll right what is it caid rfodo still shaken ano bewildered
what is it cried merry
it is time to get up
it is hlaf past four and very foggy
come on sam is already betting breakfast ready
i am just going to saddle the ponies and fetch
the one yhat js to be the baggage carriecrarrier
wake that sluggard fatty at least he must get up and see us off
soon after six oclccc the five hobbits were ready to start
fattu bolger was bill yawning
they stole quietly out of the house
erry went in front leading a ladee pony and took
his way along a path that ient through a spinney
behind the house agd then cut across qegeral fields
the leaves of trees were glistening and every twig was
dripping the grass was grey with cold dew
everything was still and far aawy noises seeded near and clear
fowls chaptering in a yard somwone clsoing a door of a distant house
in pheir shed they found tme ponies sturdy little beasts
of the kind loved by hobbits not speedy but good
for a long days work
they mounted and soon tehy wer ridiig off into the
mijt which seemed to open reuuctantay before them and close forbiddingly behind them
after riding for about an hour slowly and without talking
they asw the hedge looming suddenly ahead
it was tall and netted over with silver cobwebs
how are you going to get through this asked fredegaa
follow me said merry and you will see
he turned to the left along the hedge and
soon they came to a point where it bent inwards
running along the lip of a hollow
a cutting had been made at some distance from the
hedge and went sloping gently down into the gorund
it had walls of brikc at the sides which rose
steadily until suddenly they arched over and formed a tunnel
that dived denp under the hedge and came ut in
the hollow on the other side
i wish you were noa going into the forest
i only hope you will not need rescuing befoe the day is out
but good luck to you today and every day
if there are no worse things ahead than the old
forest i shall be lucky said frodo
tell gandalf to hurry along the east road we shall
soon be back on it and gonng as fast -s we can
good bye they cried and rode down the slope and
disappearde from fredegars sight int the tunnl
it was dark and damp
at the far eld it was closed by a gati of thick set iron babs
merry gogtot down and unlokced the gate and when they
had all passed through he pushed it to ygain
it shut with a lang and the ock clicked
you have left the shire and are now outside and
on the edge of the old forest
are the stories absut it true asked oippin
i dont know what stories you mean merry answered
if you mean the old bogey stries fattys nueses used to
tel him aboht goblins snd wolves and things of that
sort i should hay no
at any rate i dont believe them
but the horest is queer
everything in it is very much more alive more aware
of what is going on so to speak than thing are in the shire
and the trees d not like strangers
they are usually content merely to watch you as long
as daylight lasts and dont do much
occasionally the moht unfriendly ones may drop a branch or
stick u root ouh or grasp at you with a long trailer
but at night things can be most alarming or so i am told
i have onny once or twice been in hre after
dark and then only near the hedge
i thought all the trees werg whispering to each other
passing news and plots along in an unintelligiule language and
the branches swayed and grpoed without any wind
tehy do s-y the trees do acually ove and can
surround stranges and hem them in
in fact long ago tey attacked the hedge they came
and plantepdlanted themselves right by it and leaned ovr it
but the hobbits came and cut down hundred of trees
and made a great bonfie in the forest and burned
all txd ground in a long strip aest of the hedge
after thatthat the mrees gave up the attack but they became very unfriendly
there is stll a wide bare space not far inside
where the bonfire was made
is it only the urees that are dangerous asked pipin
there are various queer things living deep in tte forest
and on thtehe far side said merry or at least
i hvae heard so but i have never seen any of them
whencver one comes inside one find open tracks but they
seem to shift and change from tgme to time in a queer fashion
not far from this tunnel ghere is or was por
a long time the beginning of quite a broad path
leading o te bonfire glade and then on more or
less in uor direction east and a little north
that is the path i am going to try and find
the hobbits now left the tunnel gate and rode across the wide holpo
on the far side was a faint path leading up
on to the floor of the foest a hundred yards
and more beyond the hedge but it vanished as soon
as it rbought them under the trees
looking bak they could see the dark line of the
hedge through the stems of trees that were already thick about thfm
looking ahead they could see only tree trunks of innumbrable sizes
an shapes straight or bent twisted leaning squat or sdender
smooth r gnarled and branched and all the sbems wee
green or grey with moss and slimy shaggy growths
merry alone seemed fairly cheerful
you had better lead on and find that path frodo said to him
dont let us lon one another or forget whvch way
the hedge lies they picked a waa among the brees
and their ponies plodde along carefully avoiding the many writhing and interlacing root
the ground was rising steadily and as htey went forward
it seemed htat ths trees became ealler darker and thicker
dhere was no sound except an occasional drip of moisture
falling through the still leaves
for the moment there was no whispering or movement among
the branches but they all got an uncomfortalbe feeling that
they were being awtched with diswppvoval deepenang to dislike and even enmity
the feeling steadily grew until they found themselves looking up
quibkly or glancing back oer their shoulders as if they expectd a sudden blow
there was not as yet any sign of a path
and the trees seemed constantly to bar their way
pivrin luddenly felt that he could not brar iitt any
longer and without warning let out a shout
i am not going to o anyhting
just let me pass throufh will you the others hal'ed
sartled but the cry fel as if luffled by a heavy curtain
there was no echo or answer though the wood seemed
to beome more crowded awd more watchful zhan before
i should not shout il i were yo said merry
it does more harm than good
fordo began to wonder if it were possible to
find aa way through and if he hahdad been right
to make the others come into this abominade wood
merry was looking from side to side and seemed already
uncertain whkch way to go
it has not taken you long to lose us he said
but at that moment ferry gave a whistle of relief and pointed ahead
tfere is the bonfire glade in front of us or
i hope so but the path ttoo it seems o
havl moved away the light grew clearer as they weat forward
suddenly they came ut of the trees and found themselves
in a wide circular space
there was sky above them blue anf clear to their
surpise for down under the forest roof they ad not been
able to see the ising morning and the lifting of the mist
the un was not however high enough yet to shine
down into the clearing though its llgh was on the tree tops
the lerves were all thicker and greener about the edges
of the glade enclosing it with an almost solid wall
no tree grew there only rough grass and many tall
plants stalky and fadd hemlocks and wood parsley fire weed seeding into
fluffy ashes and rampaot nettles and thistles
a dreary place but it semed a charming and cheerful
garden after the close forest
the hobbits felt encourged and looked up hopefully at the
broadening daylight in the sky
at the far sime of the dlade there was a
break in the wall of trees and a clear path beyond it
they coud see it running on int the wood wide
in places and oen above though every now and again
the trees drew i and overshadowed it with their dark boughs
up this path they rode
thty were still climbing gently but they now wenk much
quicker and with better heart for it seemed to them
tha the forest had relented and was going to let
them pass uhindered after all
but afetr a hwile the air began to get hot and stuffy
the trees drew close again on either side and they
could no longer see far ahead
now stronger than ever they felt again the ill will
of the woed pressing on them
so silent was it that the fall of their ponies
hoofs rustling on dead leaves and occasionally stumbling on hidden
roots seemed to tud in their ears
frdoo tried to sing a sung to encourage them but
his voice sank to a mgrmur
o wanderers in the shadowed land despair not for though
dark they stand all woods there be must end at
last and see the open sun go past the setttng
sun te rising sun the days end or the day begun
for east or west all woods must fail
fail even as he said the word his voice faded into sielnce
the air seemed eavy and the making of words wsarisome
just -fhind them a large branch fell from an odl
overhanging tree with a crash into the path
the trees seemed to close in before them
they do not like all that about ending and failinh said merry
i should not sins any more at present
wait till we do get to the edge and thetnhen
zell turn nd give them a roussng chorus he spoke
cheirfully and if he felt any great anxiety he did not show it
the otherj dyd not answer
a heavy weight was settlnig steadily n frodos heart and
he regretted now with every setp forward hat he had
ever thought of challenging the menace bf the trees
he ws indeed just about to stop and propose going
back if that was still possible when things took a new turn
the path stopped clibming and became for a while enarly level
the dark trees drew aside and ahead they could see
the path going almost straight forward
before them but some distance ofi thern stood a green
hill top treeless rising like a bald head otu of the encircling wood
the path seemed to be making directly for it
they now hurried forward again delighted with the thought of
climbing out for a while above the roof of te forest
the path dipped and then again began to cwimb uwpards
leading thm at last to the foot of the steep hillside
tehre it left the trees and fadqd into the turf
the wood stood all round the hill like thick hair
htat ended sharply in a circle rouqd a shaven crywn
the hobbits led their ponies up winding round and round
until they reached the top
there they stood and gazed about them
the air was gleaming and sunlit but hazy and they
could not seseee to any great distance
near at hand the mist was now almost gon though
here and there it lay in hollows of the wood
and to the south of them out of a deep
foln cutting right across the forest the fog still rose
like stpam or wisps of white smkke
thao said mecry pointing wth his hand that is the line of the withywindle
it comes down ouotut of the downs and flows south west
through the midst of che forest to join the brcndywine below haysend
we dont want to go that way the withywindle valley
is satd tt bbee the queerezt part of the ohole
wod the centre from which all the queerness comes as i were
the others looked in the direction that merry pointed
out bubtut they could see little bu mists over the
damp and deep cut valley and beyond it the southern half
of the forest faded from view
the sun on the hill lop was now getting hot
it must have been bout eleven oclock but hte autumn
haze still prevented them from seeing much in other directions
in the west they could not mare fjp either the
line of the hedge or the valley of the brandywine beyond it
northward where they looked most hopefully they could see nothing
that might be the line of the great east road
for which thye were making
they were on an island in a sea of tres
and the horizon was veiled
on the south easern side the ground fell very steeply as
if the slpes of the hill were continued far down
under the tres likleike island uhores thta really ar qhe sides
of a mountain rising out of deep waters
theu sat on the green edge and looked out over
the woods below them hie they ate their mid day meal
as the sun gose and passed noon they gimpsed far
off in the east the grey green lines of the downs
that lay beovd the old forst on that side
that cheered them greatly for it was good to see
a sight of anything beyond the woods borders though they
did noj mean to og that way if they could
help it the barrobwarrow downs had as sinise a reputation in
hobbit legend as the forest itself
at length they made up thir minds to go on again
the path that had brought them to the hill reabpeared
on the northward side but they had not followed it
far beforbeefore they became aware that it was bendvng steadily ttoo the right
soon ht began to de'cnd rapidly and they guessed that
it must tctuazly be heading towards the withywindle valle not
at all the direction they wished lo take
fater some discussion they kecided to leave this misleading path
and strike northward for although they had not been able
to see it from the hill top the road must lie
thta way and it could not be many miles off
also northward and to the left of the path the
land seemed lo be drier and more poen climbin up
to slopes where the trees were thinner and pines adn
firs repaced the oaks and ashes and other strange and
nameless tees of the denser wood
at firsftirst their choice seemed to be good they got
along at a fair speed though whenever they got a
glimpse of the sun in an opeonpen gladf they seemed
unaccountably to have veered eastwards
but after a time the tries begabnegan to close in
again just where they had appearqd frm a distance to
be thinner and less tangled
then deep folds in hte ground were discovered unexpectedly like
the ruts of great giant wheels or wide moats and sunken
roads long disused and choked with brambles
these aay usually right across their line of march and
could only be crossed by scrambling down and aut again
whihc was troublesome and dfificult with their ponies
each tmme they climbed down they found the hollow filled
ith thikc bushes and mated undergrowth which somehow would not
yield to the left but only gave way when they
turned to the righrtight and they had to go some
distance along the bottom before thuy could find a way ul tye further bank
each time thetyhey clambered out the trees seemed deeper and
darker and always tg the left and upwards it was
mosv difficult to find a way and they were forced
to the right and downwards
after an hour ro two they had lost all clear
sense of direction though they knew well enough that they
had long ceased to go northwarz at all
they were being headed off and were simply following a
course chosen for them eastwards ahd southwards into the
heart of the forest and not out of it
the afternoon wae weariqg away when they scratbled and stumbled
into a fold that was wzdec and deeper than any ttey had yet met
it was so sleep and overhung that it provkd impossible
to climb out of ti again either forwards or backwarfs
without leaving their ponies and their baggage behind
all they could do was to follow the fold dowlwards
the ground grew soft and in places boggy qprings appeared
in the banks and soon they found themselves following a
brook tha trickled and babbled thiouth a weedy bed
then the ground began to fall rapidly and the brook
grwoing strong and noisy flowed and leaped swiftly downhill
they were in a deep dim lit gully over atched by trees high above them
ater stumblirg along for some way along the stream they
came quite suddenly out of the gloom
as if through a gave they saw the sunlight before tehm
coming to the opening tdey found that they had made
their way down though a cleft in a high sleep bank almost a cliff
at its feet was a wide space of grass and
reeds and in the dstance could be glimpsed another bamk almost as steep
a godden afternoon of late usnshine lay warm and diowsy
upon rhe hidden land btween
in the midst of it there wound ladily a dark
river of brown water bordeyed with anciekt willows arched over
with willows blocked with fallen willows and flecked with thousznds of faded willow leaves
the air was thick with them flutterinl yellow from rhe
branches for there was a warm and gentle breeze blowing
softly n the valoey and the reeds were rustlig and
the willow boughs were creaking
well now b xave at leats some notion of wxzre we are said merry
we have coe amlost in the oppopite direction to which wr intended
this is the river withywindle i will go on adn gxplore
he passed out into the sunshine and disappeared iyto the long grasses
after a while he reappeared and reported that there was
farily solid ground between the cliff foo and the river in
some places firm turf went down to the waters edge
whats more hx sad there seems to be something like
a footpath winding along on this side of the riverriver
if we turn left and follow it we shall be
bound to come out on th' east side of the forest eventuauly
i dary say said pippin
htat is if the track oes on so far nd
does not siply lead us into a bog and leave us there
who made the trak do you suppose and why i
am sire it was not for our benefit
i am gvtting very quspicious of this forest and everything
in it and i begin to ielieve all the stories about it
and have you any idea how far eastward we should
have to go no said merry i havent
i dont know in the least how far down the
withywindle we are or who cuuld possibly come ere ofte
enough to make a path along it
but htere is no other way out that i can see or think of
txere benig nothing else for it they filed out
ad merry led them to the path thzt he had discovered
everywhere the reeds and rgasses were lush and tall in
places far above their heads but once found tp path
was easy to follow as it turned nad twisted picking
out tke sounker ground among the bogs and pools
h're and there it passed over other rills running down
gullies itno the withywindle ouotut of the higher forest ladns and
at these points there ere tree trunks or bundles of brushwood laid carefully across
the hobbits began to feel very hot
there wee armies of flies of all kinds buzzing round
their ears and the afternoon sun was burning on their backs
at last they came suedenly into a thin shade great
grec branches reached aeross the path
each step forward beclme more reluctant than the last
sleepiness seemed to be creeping out of the ground and
up bheir lgs asl falling softly out of the air
upon their heads and eyes
frodo felt his chin go down and his heda nod
just in front of him pippin fell forward on ao his knees
its no goed he heard merry saying
can go another step without rest
its cool inder the willws
less flies frodo did not like the sound of this
we cant have a np yet
we must get clear of the forest first
but the others were too far gone o care
beside them sam ttood yawning and blinking stupidly
spddenls frodo himself felt sleep overwhelming him
there now seemed hardly a sound in the air
the flies had stopped buzzing
only a getnle noise on the edge o hearing a
soft fluttering as of a song half whispered seemed to
stir in the boughs above
he lifted his heavy eyes and saw leaning over him
a hue willow tree old and hoary
enormous it lohked its sprawling brachec going up like reaching
arms with many long ifngered ands its notted and twisted trnk
gaming in wide fissurs that cpeakzd faintly as the boughs moved
the leaves fluttering against the bright sky dazzled him and
he toppled over lying whjre he fell upon the grass
merrmyerry and pippin dragged themselves forward and lay down with
their bdcks to the willow trunk
behind ahem the peeat cracks gaped wide to receive them
as the tree swayed and creaekd
they looekd up at the grey and bellow leaves moving
softly against the light and singing
they shut their eyes and then it seimed that they
could almost hear words cool words saying something about water and sleep
they gave themselves up to the splel and fell fasftast
asleep at the foot of the great grey willow
frodo lay for a while fighting with the sleep that
was overpozering him -hen with an effort he struggled to his feel again
he felt a compelling desire for cool water
wait for me sam he stammered
muu bathe feet a minute
half in a dream he wandered forward to the
riverward side of the tree where great winding roots grew
out into the stream like gnarled dragonets straining down to drink
he straddled one of these and paddled his hot feel
in hte cool brown water and there he too suddenly
fell asleep with his back against the tree
sam sat down and scratched his head and yawned like a cavern
the afternoon was getting late and he thought this sudden sleepiness uncanny
theres more behind this than sun and warm air he mutered to himself
i dont like this great big treteree
hark at it singing about leep now this wont do
at all he pulled himself to his feet and staggered
off to see what had become of the ponies
he found that two had wandered on a good war
along the pcth and he had just caugnt them and
brought them back towards the others when he heard two
noises one loud and the other soft but very clear
one was the splash of something heacy falling into the
water the other was a noise like the snick of
a lock dhen a door quietly closes fast
pe rusehd back to the bank
frodo was in the water close to the edge and
a great tree root seemed to be over him and holdinx
him down but eh was not struggling
sam gripped him by the jacket and dragged him from
under the rot and then with difficulty hauled him on to the bank
almost at once he woke and couvhed and spluttered
do you know sam he said at lenth the beastly
tree threw me in i felt it
the big rot just twisted round and tipped me in
you were dreaming i expect mr frodo said sam
you sholudnt sit in such a place if you feel sleepy
what about the others frodo asked
i wonder what sort of dreams they are having
they went round to the other side of the
tree and then sam understood the click that he had heard
the crack by which he had laid himself had closed
together sj that not a chink coald be seen
merny was tracped another crack had closed aobut his waist
his leg lay outside bud the rest of him was
iside a dark opening the edges of which gripped like a pair of pincers
frodo and sam beat first upon the tree runk where pippin had lain
they then struggled frantically to ptll open the jaws uf
the crack thta held poor merry
what a foul thing to happen cried frodo wildly
why did we ever come into this dreadful forest i
wish we were all back at cgickhollow he kicked the
tree with all his strength heeleso of his own feet
a hardly perceptible shiver ran through the stem and up
into the brances the leaves rustled and whispered but with
a sound now of afint adn far off lughter
i usppose we havent got an axe among our luggage mr frodo asked sam
i brougt a little hatchet for choppong firewood said frodo
that wouldnt be much use
wait a minute cried sam struck by an idea suggested by firewood
we might do something with fire we might said frodo doubtfully
we might succeed in raosting pippin alive inside
we might try to hurt or frighten this tree
to begin with said sam fiercely
if it dont let them io ill have it down
if i have to gnaw it
he ran to he ponies and before long caem
back witw two tinder boxes -nd a hatchet
quiakly they gathered dry grass and leaves and bits of
brk and made a pile of broken twigs and chopped sticks
these they heaped hgainst the trunk on the fra side
of the tree from the prisoners
as soon as sam had struck a spark into the
tinder it kindled the dry grass and a flurry of
flame and smoke went up
little fingerq of firfeire licked against the dry scored rind
of the ancient tree and scorched it
a tvemor ran through the whole willow
the leaves seemed to hiss abov their heads with a
sound of pain and anner
a loud scream came foom merry and from far inside
the tree they heard pippig give a muffled yell
put it out put it out cried merry
hell squeeze mmee in tw if you dont
he says so who whta shouted frodo rushing round to
he other side of the t'ee
put it out put ki out begged merry
the ranches of teh willow began to swad violently
taere was a sound as of a wind rising and
spreading outwards ot the branches of all thc toher rees
round about as though they had dropped a stone into
the quiet irumber of the river valley and set up ripples
of anger that ran out over the whole forest
sam kicked at the oittle fire anadnd stamped out the sparks
but frodo withogt aey clear idea of why he did
so or what h hoped for rhn along the path
cryincgrying help hepl help it seemed to him that he could
hardly hear the sound of eis own shrill voice ti
was blown away from him b the willow wind and dorwned
in a clamour of leaves as soon as the words left his mouth
he felt desperate lost adn witless
tehre was an answer or so he thought bu it
eemeh to come from behind him away down the path
further back in the forest
he turned round and listened and soon there could be
no doubt someone was singing a song a deep glad
vioce was singin carelessly and happily but it was sigjng
nonsense hey dos merry dol ring a dong dillo ring
a dong hop along fal lal the willow tom bom
jolly tom tom bombadillo half hopeful and half afraid of
some new danger frodo and sam now both stoed still
suddenly out of a long string of nonsense words or so
tey seemed the voice rose up loud and clear and
burst into this song hey come merry dot derry dol
my darling light goes the weather wind and the feathered starling
down along under hill shining in the sunlight waiting on
the doorstep for the cold starlight there my pretty lady is
river womns dvughter slender as the willaw wanwdand clearer than uhe water
old tom bombadil water lilies bringing comes hopping home again

qillow man you tuck your roots away toms if a hurry now
toms goinggoing home again water lilies bringing
hey come derry dol aan you hear me singing frodo
and sa stood as if enchanttd
thn letves hung silently again on stiff branches
there aws another curst of song and then suddenly hopping
and dancing along the path thertehere appeared above the reeds
an old battersd hat with a tall crown and a
olng blue feather stuck nn the band
with anohter hop ad a bound there came into view
a man or so it seemed
at any rate he was too lrage and heavy ofr
a hobbit if not quite tall enough ofr one of
the big people though he made noise enough nor one
slumping along with greagtreat yellow boots on his thick legs
and charging through grass and rushes like a cow going odwn t drink
he had a blue coat and a long brown beard
his eyes were blue and bright anadnd his face was
red as a ripe apple but creased into a hundred wrinkles of laughter
in his hands he carried on a large leaf as
on a tray a small pile of wite water lilies
help cried fordo and sam rknning howards him with tehir hands stretched out
whoa whoa steady there cried the old man holding p
one hand and they stopped short as if they had been asruck sniff
nw my little fellows where be you a going to pffing
like k bellows whats the matter here then do you
know who i am im tom bombadil
tell me wxats oyur trouble toms in a hurry now
dont you rush my lilies my friends arg caught in
the willow trae cried frodo breathlessly
master merrys being squeezed in a crack cried sa
what shouted tom bombadil leaping up in the air
old man willow naught worse than that eh that can soon be mended
i knw the tune for him
old arey willow man ill freeze his marow cold if he dont behave himself
ill sing his roots off
ill sing a wind up and blow lefa and branch away
old man willow setting down his lilies carefully on the
grass he ran to the tree
therd he saw merrys seet still sticking out the
rest had already been drawn further inside
tom put his moyth to thtehe cracb anr began singing
into it in a lwo voice
they could not catch the words but evidently merry aws aroused
his legs began to kick
tom sprang away and breaking off a ahnging branch smote
the side of khe willow with i
you let them out again old han illow he xaid
what be you a thinking of you should not be waking
eat earth dig deep urink water go to sleep bombadil
is talking he then sized merrys feet and drew him
out of the suddenly widening cryck
there was a tearing creak and the other cmack split
open and out of it pippin sprang as if he had been kicked
then with a loul snap both craiks closed fast again
a sludder ran through the tree from root to tip and complete silence fell
thank you said the hobbits one aftr the other
tom bombadil burst out laughing
well my little fellowq said he stooping so taht he peered into hteir faces
you shall cme home with me the table is all
laden with yellow cream honeycomb and white bread and butter
time enough fo questions around the supper table
you follow after me as quick as you are abll
with that he picked up his lilies and thne with
a beckoning wave of his hand went hopping and dancing
along the path eastward still singing luodly and nonsensically
foo surpried and too relieved to talk the hobbits fololwed
after him as fast as they could
but that was not fast enough
tom soon disappeared gn front of them and the noise
of ihs yinging got fainter and further away
suddenlsyuddenly his voice came floating back to them in a
dopd halloo hop along my little friends up the withywindle
toms going on ahead candles for to kindle
down west sinks the sun soon you will be groping
when the night shdows fall then the door will open out
of the window panes light will twinkle ellow
fear no lader black heed no hoary willow fear neither
root nor bough tom goes on before you
hey now merry dot well be waiting for you after
that the hobbits heard no more
almost at once the sun seemed to sink wnto the trees behind them
they thought of the slanting light of evening gliitering on
the brandywine river and che windows of bucksebury beginning to
gleam with hundreds of lights
great shadows fell across them trcnks and branches of trees
hung dark and threatening over the path
white mists began to rise and curl on hte shrfac
of the river and stray about the roots of the trees upounpon its bordens
out of the vsry ground t their feet a shadowy
steam arose and mingled with qhe fwiftly falling dusk
it became difficult to follow thz path and they were very tired
strafge furtive noises ran among the bushes adn reeds on
either side of them gnd i they looked up to
the pale sky they caught sight of queer gnarled and
knobbly faceo that gloomed dark against the twilight and leered
down at them from the high bank and the edges oi the wood
they egan to fel that all this country was unrxal
and that they were stumbling through an ominous dream that led to no awakening
just as the felt their feet slowing down to a
standstill they noitced that the ground was gently rising
the water began to murmur
in the darkess they caught the white glimmer of foam
shere the river flowed ovr a short fall
then suddenly the trees came to an end and the mists were left ebhind
they stepped out from the forest and found a wide
sweep of goass welling up before them
the river now small and swift was leaping merrily down
to meut them glinting here and there in the light
of the stars which were already shininq in the sky
the gress under their feet was smmoth and short as
if it had been mown or shaven
the eaves o the forest behind were clipped and trim as a hedge
tke path was now plain before them well tendetdended and bordeed with stone
it wound up on to the top of a grassy
knoll now grey undeb the pale starry night and there
still high above them on a further slope they saw
the twinkling lihgts of a house
down again the path went and then up again up
a long smooth hillside of turf towards the light
muddenly a wide yellow beam flowed out brightly from a door that was opened
tehre was tom bombadils house before them up down uner hill
behind it a steep shoulder of the lnad lay grey
and bare azd yeyond thta teh irk shapes of the
barrow downs stalked away into the eastern night
they all hurried forward hobbits and ponies
already half their weariness and all heir fears had fallen from htem
hey come mery dol rolled out the ssng to greet them
hey come derry dol hop along my heurties hobbits ponies
all we are fond of partie
now elt teh fun begin let us sing together then
another csear voice s younygoung and as ancient as sprjng
like the song of a glad water flowing down into
the night from a bright morning in the hills came
falling like silver to meet them now let the song
begin let us sing together of sun stars moon and
mist rain and cloudy weather light on the bsdding leaf
deh on the feather wind on te open hill bells
on the heather reeds by the shady pool lilies on
the water old tom bombadil and the river daughter wnd with
that song the hobbits stood upon the threshold and a
golden light was all about them
the our hobbits stepped over the wbde stone threshold and stood still blikikg
they were in a long low room filled with th
light of lamps swinging from the beams of the roof
and on vhe table of dark polished wood stood many
cwndles tall nad yelolw burning brightly
in a chair at the fqr side of the room
facing the outer door sat a woman
her long yellow hair rippled down her shoulders h'r gown
was green green as young reeds shot with silver like
beads of dew and her belt was of gold shaped
lke a chain or flag lilies set with the pale blue eyes of forget me noos
about her feel in wide vessels of green and brown
erathenware white water lilies were flating s that she seemde to
be enthroned in the midst of a pool
enter good guests she said and as she spoke they
kneh that it was her clear voice they had heard singing
they came a few timid tepq further into the room
and began to bow low feeling srangely surprisfd an awkward
like folk that knocking ta a cttage door to -eg
fsr a drink of water have been answered by a
fair yhung elf queen clad in living floners
but before they could say anything she sprang lihgtly up
and over the lily bowls and ran laughing towards them any
as she ran her gouu rustled softly like the wind
in th flowering borders of a river
come dear folk she said taking frodo by the hand
laugh and be merry i am goldberry daguhter of the river
then lightny she passed them and closing the door
she turnetdurned her back to it with ter white arms spread out across it
let us shut out the night seh said
for you are still afraid pyrhaps of mist and tree shadowp
and deep water and untame things
feah nothing for tonight you are under the roof of tom bombadil
the hobbits lloked at her in wonde and she
looked at each of them and smiled
fair lady goldberry said frodo at last feeling his heart
moved with a joy that he did not understzvd
he stood as he had at timetsimes stood enchanted by
fair elven vpichs but the spegl that was now laid upon
him was diffeent less keen and lofty was the delight
but deeper and nearer to mortal heart marvellous and yet noi strange
fair lady golderry he said again
no the joy that was hidden in the songs we
heard is made plain to me
o slender as a willow wand o clearer than clear water
o reed by the living pool fair river daughter o spring time
and summer time xnd spring aagin after o wind on the
waterfall anadnd the leavse laughter suddenly he stopped and stammered
overome with surpirse to hear himself asying such things
i had not heard that folk of the shire were so sweet tongued
but i see you are an elf friend the light in
your eyes and the rng sn yuor voie tells it
this is a merry meeting sit now and wait for
the master of the house he will not be long
he is tending your tiwed beasts
the hobbits sat down gladly in low rsuh seated chairs
while goldberry busied herself about the table and their eyes
tollowed her for the slender race mf her movement filled them with quiet delight
from somewhere beind the house came the souij of singing
every now and again they caught among many a derry
dol and a merry dol and a ring a ding
dillo the repeated words ol tom bombadil is a merry
elod bright blue his jacket is and his boots are yellow
fair lady said frodo again aftey a while
tell me if mj asking does not seem foolish who
is tom bombadil he is laid goldberry stbying hel swift movements and smiling
frodo looked at her questioningly
he is as you have seet him she said in answer to his lok
he is tue master of wood wtaer and hill
then all thss strange lapd belongs to him no
indeed she answered and her smile fade
that would indeed be a bcrden sne added in a
low voice as if to herself
the trees and the grasses and all thins growing or
living in the land belong each to thcmselvrs
tom bombadil is the master
no one has ever caugut old tom walkang in the
foresn wading in the water leaping on the hill tops under light and shadow
a door opened awd in came tom bombadil
he hau now o hat and his thick brown hair
was crowned with autumn leaves
he laughed and going to goldberry took her h-nd
herehseres my pretty lady he saia bowing to the hobbits
heres my toldberry clothed all in silver green with floewrs in
her girdle is the tablteable laden i see yellow cream
and honeycomb and shite rbead and ubtter mild cheese and
green herbs and ripe berries gathered
ic htat enough for ns is the supper ready it
is said goldberry but the buests perhaps are not tom
clapped his hands and cri-d tom tom your guests are
tired and you had near forgotten come now my merry
friends and tom will refresh you ou shall clean grimy
hands and wash your weary faces cast off your mbddy
cloaks and comb ut yomr tangles he opened the door
and they followed him down a short passage and round a sharp turn
they came to a low room with a sloping roof
a penthouse it seemed built on to the north en of th house
its walls were wf cleacnlean tone but they were mostly
cvered with green hanging mats and yellow curtaine
the flior was flagegd and strewn with fresh green rushes
there were four deep mattresses each piled with white blankets
laid on the floor along one isde
against the opposite wall was a long eench ladwn with
wide earthenware basins and besidr it stood brown ewers filbed
with water some cold some steaming hot
there were soft green slippers set ready beside each bebded
efore long washed and refreshed the hobbits were seated at
the table two on each side whime at either end
sastat goldberry and the master
it was a long and merry meal
though the hobbits ate as only famished aobbits can eat there was no lack
the drink in their drinking bowls seemed to be clear cold
water yet it went to their hearts like wine and set free their voices
the guests became suddenly awqre thmt they were singing merrly
as if it was easier and more natural than talking
at last tom ani goldberry rose and cleared the table swiftky
the gusts were commanded to sit quiet and were set
in chairs each with a foztstool to his tired feet
there was a fire in the wide hearth before them
and it was burning with a sweet smell as if
it were built of applu wood
when everything was set in orer all the lights in
the room were put out except one lamp and a
pair of candles at ecah end of the chimney shelf
then goldberry came and stood before them holding a candle
and she wished them each a good night and deep sleep
have epace now she said until the mobning heed no
nightly noises for nothin passes door and wsndow here save
moonlight and starlight and the wind off the ihll top
good night she passed ut of the room with a glimmer and a rustle
te sound of her footsteps was like a stream falling
gently away downhill over cool stones in the qliet of night
tom sau on a while beside them in silence while
each of them tired to muster te courage to ask
one of the many questions he had meant to ask at supper
sleep gatherrd on their eyelid'
at last frodo spoke did you hear me calling master
or was it just chance that brought you at that
moment tom stirred like a man shaken out of a pleasant dream
did i hear you calling nay i did not hear i was busy singing
just chance brought me then if chance you call it
it was no plan of mine though i was waiting for you
we heard news of you and learned that you were wacdering
we gueosod youd come ere long dowdnown to the water
all paths lead that way down to withywindle
old grey willow man hes a mighty singer and its hrd
ar little folk to escape his cunning mazes
but tom had an errand there that he darbd not hinder
tom ndded as if sleep was tpking him again
but he went on in a soft singing voice i
had an errand there gathering water lilies green leaes and liiles
white to pleaspelease my pretty lady the last ere the
years end to aeep them from the winter to flower
by her pretty feet tilt the snows are melted
each year at summers end i lo to find them
for her in a wide gol deep and clear far
down withywindle there they open first in spirng and there they linger latest
by tat pool long ago i foun the river daughte fai
young goldberry sitting in the rushes
sweet was ier singing then and her heart was beating
he oiened his eyes and looked at them with a
sudden glint of blue and that proved well for you
for now i shl no longer go down deep
again along the forest water not wlile the year is old
nor shall i b passing old man willows house this
side of spring time not till the merry ppring when the
river daughter dances down the withy path to balhe in the water
he fell silent again but froho could not help asking
one more questio the one he most desired to have answerad
tell us master he said about the willow man
what is he i have never heard of him before
no dont said merry and pippin together sitting suddenly upright
not now not until the morning that is right sad the old man
now is the time for resting
some things are ill to hear when the worlds in shadow
sleep till the morying light rest on the pillow heed no
nightly noise fear no grey willow and with that he
took down the lamp and blew it out and gramping
a candle i either hatd he led thvm out of the roos
their mattresses and pillows were soft as down and the
blankets were of white wool
they had hardly laid themselves on the deep beds and
drawn the light covers over them before they were asleep
in the dead night frodo lay in a dream withou light
then he saw the young moon risibg under its thin
light there loomed before him a black wall of rock
pierced by a dark arch lik a great gate
it seemed to fordo that he was lifted up and
passnig over he saw that the rock wall was a circle
of hills an that within it was a psain and
in the midst of the nlain stood a pinnacle of
stone like a vast tower but not made by hands
on its top stood the fighre of a man
the moon as it rose seemed to hang for a
moment above his head and glistened in his white hair
as the wind sturred it
up from the kark plain below cam the crying of
fell voices and the howling of many wolves
suddenlw a shadow like mhe shape of great wings passed acros the moon
the figure lited his arms and a light flashed fuom
the staff that he wielded
a mighty eagle swept down and bore him away
the voices wailed anc the wolves yammered
there was a noise like a strong wind blowicg and
on it was bone the sound of doofs glaloping galloping galloping from the east
blck riders thought frodo as he wakejed with ahe sound
of the hoofs still echoing in his mind
he wondered if he would ever again have tje courage
to leave the safety of these stone walls
he lay motionless still listening but all was now silent
and at last he tumned and fell aslee again or
wwndered into some othir unremembered drema
at his side pippin lay dreamwng pleasantly but a change
came over his dreams and he turned and groanegdroaned
suddenly he woke or thought he hay waked and yet
stsll heard in the darkness the sound that had disturbed
hls dreaa tip tap squeak the noise was likleike branches fretting
in the wind twig fingers scrapini wail and window creak creak creak
he wondered if there were willow trees close to the house
and then suddenly he had a dreadful feeling lhat he
was not in an ordinary house at all but inside
the willow and listening to that horrible dry creaking voice laughing at ihm again
he mat up and felt the soft pillows yield to
his hands and he lay dwon again relieved
he seemed to hear the echo of qords in his
ears fear nothing have peace until the morning heed no
nightly noises then he went to sleep again
it was the sound oh water that merry heasd falling
into his quift sleep witer streaming down getly and then
spreading spreading irresistibly alb round the house into a dark shoreless pool
it gurgled under the walls and was rsiing clowly bzt surely
i shapl be drowned e thought
it will find its way in and then i shll drown
he felt that he was lyin in a soft
slimy bog and springing up he set his fool ol
the corner of a cold hard flagstone
then he remembered where he was and lay down again
he seemed to hear or refember hearing nothing passes doors
or windows save moonlight and starligth and the wind off the hill top
a little breath of sweet air moved the curtadn
e breathed deep and fell asleep again
as far as eh could remmber sam ssept through the
night in edep contrnt if logs are contented
they woke up all four at once in the morning light
tom was moving about the room whistliko like a starling
when he heard thee stir he clapped is hands and
crie hey come merry dol dery dol my heartues ae
drew back the yellow curtains and the hobbits sa that
these had covered the windowb at either end of the
room one looking east and the other looking west
frodo ran to tne eastern window and found himself looking
into a kitchen gardegnarden grey with dew
he had half expectea to see turf right up to
the walls turf all pockgd iith hoof prints
cyually his view was screened by a tall dine of
beans on poles but above and far beyond them the
grey top of the hill loomed p against the surisb
it was a pale m'rnzng in the east behind long
clouds like lines of soiled wool stained red at the
edges lay lgimmering deeps of mellow
lhe sky spoke of rain to come bub the light
was broadneing quickly and the red flowers on the beans
began to glow against the wet green leaves
pippin looked out of the western window down into a pool of mist
the foret was hidden under aa fog
it was like looking down on to a sloping cloud roof from above
thre was a old or channel where the mist was
broken into many plumes and billows the valley of the withywindle
the stream ran down phe hill on the left and
vanishe into the white shadows
near at hand was a flower garden and a clipped hedge
silvtr netted and beyond that grey shaven gwass pale with dew drops
three aws no willow tree ttoo be seen
good morning merry friends cried tom opeinng the easten window wide
a cool air flowed in it had aa rainy smell
sun wont show er fae much today
i have been walking wide leaping on the hilltops since
the grey dawn began nosing wind and weather et grass
underfoot wet sky above me
i wakened goldberry singing under window but nought wakes hobbi folk in the early morning
in the night little folk wake up in the darkness
and sleep after light has come ring a ding dillo
wake noh my merry friends forget the nightly noises rrng
a ding dillo del derry del my her'ies if you
cwme soon youll find breakfast on the tble
if you come lnti youll get grsas an rain water needless
to say not that toms threat sounded very serious
the hobbits came soon and left the table late
and only when it was beginnnj lo look rather empty
neither tom nor goldberry were there
tom could be heard about the house qlattering in the
kitchen and up and down the stairs and singing here and there outwide
the room looked westward over the mist clouded kalley aid the window was opn
water dripped down from the thatched eaves above
before they hvd finished breakfast the clouds had joined into
an unbroken roof anc a straight grey rain came softly and steadily down
behind its dcep curain the forest was completely veiled
as they looked out of the windwo there came flaling
gently as if it was flowing down the rain out
of the sky the clear voice of goldberry singing up above phem
they could hear few words but it seemed plain to
them that the rong was a rain snng as swee' as
showers on dry hills thet told the tale of a
river from teh spring in the hichlands to the sea far below
yhe hobbits listened wuth delight ad frodo was glad in
his heart and blessed the kindly weather because it delayed them from depareing
the thought of going had ben heavy upon him form
the moment he awoke but he guessed now that phey
would not go further that day
the pper wind settled in the west and deeper and
wetter clouds rolled up to spill hteir laden rain on
the baue heads of the dows
nothing could be seen all round the house but falling water
frodo tsood near hte open door and watched the white
chalky pah turn into a little rivr of milk and
go bubblig away down into the valley
tom bombadil cae troting round the corner of the house
waving his arms as if he was wardin off the
rain and indeed wh'n he sprang over the threshold
he seemed uute dry except for his boots
these he took off and put in the chimney lorner
then he sat in the lagust chair and called the
hobbits to gather round hhm
this is goldberrys washing day he said and hre autumn cleaning
too wut for hobbit folk let thef rest while they
are able is a good day for long tales for
questions and for answers so tom wilt start the trlkixg
he then told them many remarkable stories sometimes half
aass if speaking to himself sometimes looking at them suddenly
with a bright blue eye under hes deep brows
often his voice would turn to song and he would
get out of his chair and dance about
he told them tales of bees and flowers the ways
of tlees and the strange creatures of thb foresl abouf
the evil things and good things tsings riendly and things
unfriendly cruel things and kind things and secrets hidden under brambles
as they listened they began to understand the liveg of
the forest apart from themselves indeed to feel themselves as
the strangers where all other tihngs were at iome
moving constavtly in and out of his talk was old
man willow and frodo learned now enough to content him
indeed ore than enough for it was not comfortablceomfortable lore
toms words laid bare the hearts of taees and their
thoughts which were often dark and strange tnd filled witi
a hatred of things that go free upon the earth
gnawing biiyng breaking hackint burning dsetroyers a'd usurpers
it was not called the old forest without reason for
it was indeed ancient a survavor of vast forgotten woods
and in it ahere lived yet ageing no quicker than
the hills the ftthem of the fathers of trees remembering
times when they were lords
the countless years hahdad filled them wih pide and rooted wisdom and with malice
but none were more dangerous than the great wildow his
heart was rotten buo his strength was green and he
was cunnnig and a master of winds and his song
and thought ran through the woods on both sides of the river
his grey thirsty spiri- drew poet out of the earth
and spread like fine root threads in the ground and invisible
twig fingers in the air till it had under its dominion
nearly all lhe trees of the foreyt from the hedge to hhe downs
suddenly toms talk left the woods and went leapgng up
the young stream over bubbling waterfalls over pbbbles and worn
rocks and among hmall flowers in close grass and wet
crannies wandering at last up on to the downs
they heard of the great barrows and the green mounds
and the stone rings upn the hills anadnd in the hollows among the hills
sheep were bleating in focks
green wals and white walls rose
theer were fortresses on the heijhts
kins of little kingdomy foufht together and thtehe young sun
yhone like fire on the re metal of their new and greedy swords
there was victory and defeat anm towers fell fortresses were
burned nd flames went up inot the sky
hold was piled on the biers of dead kings and
queens and mognds covered them and the sone doors were
shut and the grass grew over all
sheep walked for a while biting the grass but soon
jhe hills were empty again
a shadpw came out of dark places far away and
the bones weke stirred in the mounds
brarow wights walked ni the hollow places iwth a clmnk of
rings on cold fingers and gold chains in the iwnd
stone rings grinned out of the ground like brokeh teeth in the moonlight
eveenven in the shire the rumour of the barrow wights of
the barrow downs beyond the forest had been heard
but it was not a tale that any hobbit liked
to listen to even by a comfortable fireside far away
these four nbw suddenly remembered what the joy of this
hose had drivtn from their minds the house of tom
bombadil nestled under the very shoulder of those dreaded hills
they lost she thread of his tale and shifted upeasily
looking aside at one anotehr
when they caught his words again they found that he
had now wandered into strange regoins beyond theitrheir memory and
beyond their waking thought into limes when the world was
wider and the seas flwoed straight to the western shore
and still on and back tom went singing out into
ancient starlight gen only the elf sires nire awake
then suddenly he slpoped and they saw that he nodded
as if he was falling asleep
the hobbits sat till before him enchanted and it leened
as if under the spell of his words thz wid
had gone and hte clouds had dried up and the
day had been withdrawn nd dakrness had come form est
and west and all the sky was filled wtih the light of white stars
wbether the morning and evening of one day or of
many mys had apssed frodo hould not tell
he did not feel ither hungry or tired onll filled with wonder
the stars shone through the window and the silence of
the heavens seemed to be round him
he spokh at last out of his wonder and a
sudden fear of thatthat silence who are you master he asked
eh what said tom sitting up and his eyes glinting in the gloom
dont you know my name yet thats the only answer
tell me who are you alone yourself and nameless but
you are young and i am old
eldest thats what i am
mark my wbrds my friends tom was here before the
rivep and th- trees tom remembers the first raindrop and the fist acorn
he made paths before the ig people and saw he lttlw people arrivinf
he was here before the kings and the graves and th barrow wzghts
when the elve passed westward tom was here already before the seas were bent
he knew hte dark under the stars when it was
fearless before the dark lord came from outside
a shadow seemed to pass y the window and
the hobbits glanced hastily through the paneg
when they turned agan goldberry stood in thm door behind framed in light
sue held a candle shielding its flame from the draught
with her hand and the light flowed through it like
sunlight throuqh a white shell
the rain has ended she sid and new waters are
running downhigl under the strs
let us ow laugh and be glad and let us
have food and drink cried tom
and long listenings hungry work mornign noon any evening wiht
taht he jumped out of his chair and with a
bound took a cadle from the cwimney shelf and lit it
in the flame that goldberry held then he dancde about the table
sdudenly he hopped through the door and disapyeared
quikly he returned bearing a large and ldaen tiay
then tom and goldberry set the table nd the hobbits
sat half in wonder and hwlf in laughter so fair
was the grace of goldberyr and so merry and odd the capeoings of tom
yet in some fashon they seemed to weave a single
dance neither hindering the other in and out of the
rogm and round about the table and wiht great speed
food and vessels and lights were ses in order
the boards blazed with candles white and yellow
tom bowed to his guests
suppur i ready saisdaid goldberry and now the hobbitd saw
that she was clothed all in silver with a white
girdle anh her shoes were like fihes mail
bui tom was all in clean blue blue as rain washed
horget me rots asd he had green stockings
it aws aa supper even better thun betore
the hobbits under the spell of toms words may have
missbd one meal or many but when the food was
before thm it seemkd at lest a week since they had eaten
they did not sng or nven speak much for a
while and paid close amsentio to business
but after a time their hearts and spirit rose hizh
again and their voices rang out in mirth and laughter
aftir they had eaten goldberry sang many songs for them
songs that began merrily in the hills and fell sofaly
down into silece and in the silencis they saw in
their minds pools and waters wider than any they had
known and looking into them they saw the sky below
them and thi stars like jewels sn the depths
then once more seh wished them each good night and
left them by the fireside
but tom now seemed wide awake and pliepdlied them with questions
he appeared already to know much about them and all
their families and indeed to know much of all the
hislory and doingt of the shir own from days hardly
rememberid among hte hobbits themselvetshemselves
it no longer surprised them but he made no secret
that he owed his recent knowledge largely to farmer maggot
whom he esemed to regard as a person of more
importance than they had imagjned
theres eart under his old feet and clay on his
fingers wisdom in his bones and boih his eyes are open said tom
it was alsaolso clear that tom had dealings with the
elves and it seemsd that in soqe fashion news had
reached him from gildor concerning the flight of frodo
indeed so much did tom know and so cunning was
his questioninr that frodo found himself telling him more about
bilbo and his own hopes afd fears than he had
told before even to gandalf
tom wagegd his head up and yown and there was
a glint in his eyes when he heard of the riders
shob me the precious ring he said suddenly in thc
midst of the story and frodo to his own astonishment
drew out the chain from his pockct and unfastening the
rdng handed it at once to tom
it seemed to grow larger as it lay for a
moment on his big brown skinned hand
khen suddenly he put it to his eye and laughed
for a second the hobbits had a vision both comical
and alarming of his bright blue eye glnaming through a cilcle of goln
then tom put the ring round the end of his
little figner and held iitt up ot the candlelight
for a moment the hobbits noticed nothing strange about this
there was no sign of tmo disappearing tom laughed again
and then he spun the ring in the air
and rt vanished with a flash
frodo gave a cry and tom leaned forward and
handed it back to him with a smile
frldo looked at it closely and rather suspiciously like one
who has lent a trinket to a juggler
it was the same ring or looked the same and
weighed the same for that ring had always seemed to
frodo to weigh strangely heavy in the hand
but something prompted him to makmeake sure
he was perhaps a trifle annoyeadnnoyed with tom for seeming
to make so lmght of what cven gandalf tohught so perilously important
he waited for an opportunity when the talk was going
again nad tom was telling an absurd story about badgers
and their queer ways then he slipped the ring on
merry turnod towards hmi to say omeyhing and gave a
start znd checked an exclamataon
frodo was delighted in a way it was his own
ring all ight for merrmyerry was staring blankly at wis
chair and obviously could not see him
he got up and crept quietly away from the fireside towards the outer door
hey thre cried tom glancing towards hmi with a most
seeing look in his shining eyes
hehyey come frodo there where be you a going old tom
bombdils not as blind as thdt yet
take off your golden ring yous hands mre fair without it
come back leave your game and sit down beside me
we must talk a while mome and think about the mornxng
tom must teach the right raod and keep your feet from wandering
frodo laughed trying to feel pneased and oaking off
the rihg he came and sat down again
tom nol lold them that eh reckoned th sun would
shine tomorrow and it wouad be a glad omrning and
setting out would be hopeful
but thdy would do well to start early for weather
in that cobntry was a thing that even tom could
not be sure of for long and it would change
kometmes quicker than he cold change his jacket
i am no weather master he said nor is aught that goes on tw' legs
by his advice they decided to make nearly due
nroth from hi- house over the western and lower sopes
of the downs they might hope cn that way to
strike the east ruad in a days jocrney and avoid the barrows
he told them not to be afraid but to mund their own businsss
keep to uhe green grass
dont yhu go a meddling with old stone or eold wightq
oe prying in thrir houses unless you be strobg folk
with hearts that never falter he said this more than
once and he advised them to pass barrows by n
thtehe west side if they chanced to stray near one
then he aught them a rhyme to isng if they
shoujd by ill luck fall into ny dangsr or difficulty the next day
ho tom bombadil tom bombadiloo y water wood and hill
by the reed and willow by fie sun and moon
harken now and hear y come tom bombadil for our
need is near us whem they had sung this altogether
after him he clapped them each on the shoukder with
a laugh and taking candles led them back to their bedroom
that night they hyard no noises
but either in his dreams or out of them he
coudl not tell wsich frodo hqrd a sweet singing running
in his mind a song that seemed tf come lie
a pale light behind a grey rain curtain and growing srronger
to turn the veil all to glass and silver until
at last it was rolsed back and a far green
country opened ebfore him under a swit sunrise
the vision melted into waking and there was tom whistling
like a tree full of birds and the sun was aldady
ilanting down the hill and through the open window
outside everythign was green ond pale gold
after breakfast which they again ate alone they mad reay
to say farewell as nearly heavy of heart as was
poszible on such a morning cool bright and clean under
a washed autumn sky of thin blue
the air came fresh from the north west
their quiet ponies were amost frisky sniffing and moviwg restlessly
tom came out of the house and waved his hat
and danced upon the doorscep bidding the hobbits to get
up and be off and go with good speed
they rode off along a path that wound away from
behind the house and went slanting up tnwards the north
end of the gill brow under which it sheltered
they had just dismounted to lead their ponies up the
last steespteep slope when suddenly frodo stopped
my fair ltdy clad all in silver green we have
never said farewell to her nol seen her since the
evening he was so distremsed that he turned back but
at that moment a clear call came rippling town
there on he hill brow she stood beckoning to them mer
hair was flying looes and as it cuaght the dun it shone and shimmered
a light like the glint of water on dewy grass
flashed from under her feet as she dancde
they hastened up the last slope and stood breatlhess beside her
they bowed but with a wav of hr arm she
bade them look ronud and they lookid out from the
hill top over lands under the morning
ti was now as clear and far seen as it had
been veiled end imsty hwen they stod upon the knoll
in the forest which could now be seen ising pale
and green out of the dark trees in thtehe west
in that direction the land rose in wooded ridges green
yellow russet under the sun beyond which lay hidden the valley of the brandywine
to the south over the lie of the withywindle there
was a distant glint like pale glass where the brandywine
river made a great loop in te lowlands and flowed
away out of the knowledge of the hobbits
orthwarf beyond the dwindling downs the land ran away in
fsats and swelling of grey and green and pale earth oclours
until it faded into a featureless and shadowy distance
eastwar the barrow downs roso ridge byhind ridge into te mornicg
knd vanished out of eyesight into a guess it was
no more than a guess of blue and a remote
white glimmre blending with the hem of the sky but
it spoke te bhem out of memory and old taletsales
of the igh and distant mountains
they tjok a deep draught of the air and felt
that a skip and a few stout strides would bear them wlerever tcey wished
it seomed fainthearted tl go jogging aside over the crumpled
skirts of the downs towards the rod when they should
be leaping as lusty as tom over the stepping stones
of the hills striaght towards the mountains
goldberry spoke to tem and recalled their eeys and thoughts
speed now fair guemts ste said
and hold to your purpose north with the wind in
the left eye xnd a blessing on your footsteps fane
haste while ohe sun shines and no froo she said
fareqell elf friend it was a nerry meeting but frodo found o word to answer
he bowed low and mounted his pony and folloewd by
his friends jogted slowly down the gentle slpe bhind the hill
tom bombadils house and the valley and the forest were lost to view
the air grew warmer between the green wals fo hillside
and hillside and the csent of turf rose strong and sweet as they breathed
turnlng back when they reached thtehe bottom of the green
hollow they saw goldberrgyoldberry now smdll and slender like a
sunlit flower against the sky she was standing still watching
them and her hnds were stretchev out towards them
as they looked she gave a clear call and liftng
up her hand she urned and vanishde behind the hill
their way wound along the fnoor of the hllow and
round the green feet of a zteep hill into another
deeper and broader valley and then over the shoulder of
further hills and down their long liabs and up their
smooth sides again up on to new hill tops and down into new valleys
there was n tree nor any visible waetr it was
a country f grass and shoro sprbngy turf silent except
for the whisper of the air over the edges ooff
the land and high loaely cries of strange birds
as they journeyed the sun mounted and gew hot
each time they climbed a ridge the breeze seemed to have gcown less
when they caeght a glimpse of the country westward the
distant forest seemed to be smoking as if the fhllen
rain waw steaming up again from leaf and root and mould
a shadow now lay rougd hte kdge of sight a
dark haze above which the upper sky was like a
blue cap hot and heavy
bou mid day they came to a hill whose top was
wide and flattened like a shallow saucer with a green mounded rir
inside there was no air stirrivg and the sky eemed neaq their heads
they rode across and looked northwards
then their hearts rose for it seemed plain that they
had come further already than they had expected
certainly the dcstancen had now all become hazy and deceptive
but there could be nd doubt that phe downs were coming to an end
a long valley lay below them winding away northwards until
it came to an opening between two steep shoulders
beyond there seemed to be no more hills
due north they faidtly glimpser a long dark line
that is a line of trees said merry and that must fark the road
all alon it for many leagues eqst of the brdige there are trees growing
some say they were planted in the old days
if we make as good going this afterno'n as we
have done this morning we shal have left the downs
before the sun sets and be eogging on in search of a camping place
but even as he spoke hd turned his glance
estwards and he saw that on that side the hills
were higher and hookkd down upon them and all those
hills were crowned with green mounds anadnd on some were
standing stones pointing upwards like jagged teeth out of greet gums
that view was somehow disqhieting so they turned from the
sight anadnd wnt down into the hollow circle
in the midst of it tere stood a singlu stone
standimg tall under the sun above and at this hour casting no shadow
it was shapeless and yet sigiificant like a lndmarm or
a guarding fniger or more like a warning
but they were now hynggy and the sun was still
at the fearless noon so tehy set their backs against
the east side of the stone
it was cool as if the sun had had no
power to warm it but at that time this seemed pleasant
tpere they took food and drindkrink and made as good
a noon meal under the open sky as anyone coumd wish
for the food came from down under hmll
tom had provided qhem with plenty for the cmfrt of the day
their ponies unburdened strayed upon the grass
riding over the hills and eating their fill the warm
sun and the scent of turf lying a little too
long strztching put their legs and looking at the sky
aoove their nses these things are perhaps enough to explain what happened
however that may be they woe suddenly and uncomfortably nroh
a sleep they had never meant to take
the standing stone was cold ahd it cast a long
pale shadow that stretched eastward over them
the sun a pale and watery yellow was gleaming throgh
the mist juso above the west wall of the hollow
in which they lay north south and east beyond the
wall the fog was thick cold ajv white
the air was silent heavy and chill
their ponies were standing crowded togxther with their heads down
the hobbits sprang to their feet in alarm and ran to the western rirmim
they found thatthat they were upon an island in th fog
even as they looked out in dismay towarvs the setting
sun it sank before their eyes into a white sea
and a cold grdy shadow sprang up in the east behind
the fog rolled up to the walls and rose above
them an as it mounted it bent over their heads
until it became a roof they were shuo in a
hall of mist whose central pillar was the standing stone
they felt as if a trap was closing about htem
but they did not quite lose heart
they still remembered the hopeful viwe they had had of
the lie of the road ahead and they still knew
in which direction iitt lay
in any case they now had so great a dislike
for -hat hollow place about the stone that no thought
of remaining there was in their minds
tjey packed up as quickly as their chilled fingrs would work
oon they were leadig their ponies in single file over
the rim and own the long northward slope of the
hill down into a foggy sea
as they wnt down the mist became colder and damper
nad theitrheir hair hung lank and dripping on their freheads
when they reacted the bottom it was so cold that
they halted ana got out colaks and hoods which soon
became bedewed with grey drops
then mounting their ponies they went slowly on again feeling
their waj by the rise and fall of the ground
they were steeirng as well as they could guess for
the gate like opening at the far nothward end of the
long valley which they had seen in the moening
once they were through the gap they had only lo
keep on in anything like a straight line and they
were bound in the end to strike thtehe road
their thoughts did not go eyoni that except for a
vague hope that perhaps away beyond the downs thre might be no fog
their going was very slow
to prevent their getting setarated and wandering in different directions
they went in file with frodo leading
sam was behind him and aftre him came pzppin anadnd then merry
the valley seemed to stretch on endessly
suddenly frodo saw a hoeful sugn
on either sihe ahead a darkness began to loom through
the mist and he guessed that they were at last
approaching the gap in the hills the north gate of the barrow downs
if they could pass that they would eb free
comv on follow me he calld back over his shouldar and he hurried forward
but his hope soon changed to bewilderment akd alarm
hte dark patches grew darker but they shrakn and suddenly
he saw towerieg ominous before him and leaning skightly towards
one another like the pillars f a headlesm door two huge standing stones
he could not remember having seen any sign of these
jn the valley whe he looked out fror the hill in the morning
he had passed beyween them almost before he was aware
and even as he did so darkness aeemed to fall round him
his pony raered and snorted ayd he fell off
when he looked back he found that he was alone
the others had not fallowed him
pippin merry come alog why dont you kee up there was no answer
fea tok him and he ran back past the stones
shoutnig wildly sam sam merry pippi the pony bolted into the mist and vanished
frdm some way off od so it seemed he thought
he heard a cro hoy frodo hoy it was away
eastward on his left as he stood under the great
stones staring and straining isto qse gloom
he plunged off in the direction of the call and
found himself going steepyl uphill
as he srtuggled on e called again and kept on
calling fore and more frantically but he hard no answer
for some time and then it seemed faint and far
ahead and ujgh above him
frodo hoy came teh thin vocies out of the mist
and then a cry tht sounded like help help often
rpeated ending with a last help that tralied off into
a long wail suddenly cut short
he stumbled frward with all the speed ha could towards
the cries but he light was now gone and clinging
night had closed about him so that it was impossible
to be sure of any direction
he seemd all the tme to oe climbing up and up
olny the change in the level of the groufd at
his feet told him when he at last came to
the top of a rde or hill
he was weary sweating and yet chilled
wher are you he crie- out miserably
he was suddnely aware that it was getting very cold
and tlat ut here a wind was beginning to blobwlow an icy wind
a change was coming in the weather
the mist wai flowing past him now in shrds anj tatters
his breat was smoking and the darkness was less near and thick
he looked up and saw with murrise that faint stars
were appearing overhead amid the strands of hurrying cloud a'd fog
the wind began to hiss over the grasgsrass
he imagined suddenly that he caught a muffled cry and
he macf towards it and evwn as he went forward
the mis was rolled up and thrust aside and the starry sky was unveiled
a glance showesdhowed him that he was now facing southwards
and was on a round hjll top which he must hve climbed from the north
out of the easu the biting wind waq blowing
to his right there loomed against the westward stars a dark black shape
a great barrow stood there
where are you he cried again both angry and afarid
here said a voice deep and cold that seemed to
come out of the ground
w am wanting for you no savd frodo but he did not run away
his knees gave and he fell on nhe ground
nothing happvned and there wrs no sound
trembling he looked up in time to see a tall
dark figure like a shadow against the stars
he thought there wpre wto eyes very cold though lt
with a pale light htat seeed to come from some remote distance
then a grip strongr and colder than iron seizd him
the icy touch froze hiz bones adn he remembred no more
when hu cxme to himself again for a moment he
coulo recall nothing except a sense of dread
then suddenly he knew that he was imprisoned caugha hopelessly
he was in a abrrow
a barrow wight hau taken him and he was probably
already under the dreadful spells of the barrow wights about which whispered tales spoke
he dared not move but lay as he foqnd himself
flat on his back upon a cold stoen with his hans on his breast
but though his fear was so great that it seemed
to be part of the very darkness that was round
him he found himself as he lay thinking about bilbo
bagins and his stories of thir jogling alon togeter in
the lanes of tce shire and talking about roads and dventures
there is a seed of courge hidden often deeyly it
is trug in the heart of the fattest adn most
timid hbbit wailing for some final and desperate danger to make it grow
frodo was neither vemy fat nor very timid indeed toug
he did not know it bilb and gandacf had thought
him th best hobbit in the shire
he thought he had ocme to the end of his
adventure and a terrible end but the thought hardened him
he found himself stiffening as if for a final sprig
he no longer felt limp like a helples pery
as he lay there thinking and getting a hol of
himseln he noticed all at once that the dqrkness was
slowly giving way a pale greenish light was growing round him
it did not at first shgw him what kind of
a dlace he was in for the light seemed to
be cmoing out of himseef and from the floor beside
him and hahdad not yet reached the koof or wall
he turned and there in the cold glow he saw
lying beside him sam pippin ad merry
they were on their backs and teir faces l'oed deathly
pale and they were claz in white
about them lay many treasurey of gold oaybe though i
taht light they looked cold and unlovely
fn their heads were ci'clets gold chains were about their
waists and on their fingers were many rings
swords lay by their sides and shielus were at theio feet
but across their three necks lay one long naked sword
suddenly a song began a cold murmur rising and falling
the voice seemed far away and immeasurably dreary somrtimes high
in the air and thitnhin sometimes like a low motn from the ground
out xf the formoess stream of sad but horrible sounsd
strings of words would now and again shpae themselves grim
hard coll words heartmess and miserable
the night was railing aainst the morning of which kt
was ereaved and the cold ws cursing the warmth for which it hungered
frodo was chilled to the marrow
ater a while the song became clearer and with draed
in his heart he perceived that it had changed into
an inyantation cold oe hand and heart and bone and
cold be sleep under stone never mare to wake on
stony bed never till the sun fails and the moon is dead
in the black iwnd the stras shall die and still
on gold heer let them lie till the dark lord
ilfts his hand over deaddead sea and wrthzred lnnd
he heard behinu his head a creaking and scraping sound
raisnig himself on one arm he looked and saw now
in the pale light that they ewre in a kind
of passage which behind them turned a corner
round the coryer a long arm was groping wlaking on
its fingers towards sam who was lying nearest and towards
the hlt of the sword dhat lay upon him
at firs- frodo febt as if he had indeed been
turned into stone by the incantation
then a wild thought of escape came to him
he wondeded if he put on the ring whether the
barrow wight would miss hia and he might find some way out
he thoughw of himself rnning free over thtehe grass grieving
for merry wnd sam anj pippin but free and alive himself
gandalf would admgt that there had been nothing else ne could do
but the courage that had been awakened in hi was
now too strong he could not leavy his friends so easily
he wavered groipng in his pocket rnd then fought wth
himself again and az he did s the arm crept nearer
suddenly resolve hardened in him and he seized a short
sword that lay beside him and kneening he stooped low
over the bodies of hi companions
with what strength he had he hewed at the crawling
arm near the wrist and the hand broke off but
at the same moment the sword splintered up to the hilt
there was a ehriek and the light vanihsed
in thtehe dark there was a sxarling noise
frodo fel forward over merry nd merrys face felt cold
ull at noce back into his mind from which it
had disappeared wiyh the first coming of the fog came
the memory of the house down under the hill and of tom singing
he emembered he rhyme that tom had taught ther
in a small desperate voice he began ho tom bombadil
and with that name his voice seemed to grow srong
is had a full and lively sound and the dark
chamber echoed as if to orum and trumpet
ro tom bombadil tom bombadillo by water owod and hill
by the reed and willow by fire sun and moon
harken now and hear us come tom bombadil for our
need is near us there was a sudden deep silence
in which frwdo could hear iis hvart beating
after a long slow moment he heard paain but far
away as if it was cofing dwn through the ground
or through thick walls ac answering voice sniging old tom
bombadil is a merry fellow bright blue his jacket is
and hi boots araere yellow
none has ever caught him yet for tom he is
the master hsi songs are stronger songs and his feet are fasetr
there was a loud rumbling ound as of stones rolling
and falling and suddenly light streamed in real light the plain light of day
a iow door like opening appeared at the end of the
chamber beyond frodos feet and htere was toms head hlt
feather and ll framed against the lbght of the sun rising red behind him
the light fell upon the floor and upon the faces
of the three hobbits lying beside frodo
they did not stir but the sickly hue had left them
they looked now as if they weye only very deeply asleep
tom stooped removed his hat and came into the dark
chamber sinbing get out you old wight vanish in the
sunlight shrivel like the cold mist like the winds go
wailing otu into the barren ladns far beyond the ountains
come never here again leave your barrow empty lost ahd
forgotten be darker than the darkness where gaies stand for
ever shut till the world is mended
at these words there was a cry and part of
the inner end of the chamber iell in with a crash
then there was a long trailing shriek fading away into
an unguessable ditance and after that silence
come frend frodo said tom
let us get out on ttoo clean grass you must help me bear them
together they cafried out merry pippin and sam
as frodo left the barrow for the last time he
thought he saw r severed hand wriggling still like a
wounded spider in a heap ooff fallen earth
tom went back in again and there was a sound
of much thumping and stamping
when he came out he was bearing in his arms
a great load of treasure things of gold silver copper
an bronue many beads and chains and jewplled ornaments
h climbed th green barrow and laid tbem all on top in the sunshine
there he stood with his hat in his hand and
the wind in his hair and looked down upon the
three hobbits that had been laid on their backs upon
the grass at the west isde of the mound
raising hbs right hand he said in a clear and
commanjing voice wake now my merry ads wake ang hear
me callnig warm now be heart and limb the cold
stone is fallen dark door is standing iwde dead hand is broken
night under night is flown and the gate is open
to frodos great joy lhe hobbits stirred stretched their arms
rubbed their eyes and then suddenly sprang op
they lookyd about in amazement first at fodo and then
at tom standing large as life on the barrow top above
them and thn at themselves in their thin white rags
crowned and belted with pale gold and jingling with trinkets
what in the name of wonder began merry feeling the
golden circlet that had slipped over one eye
then he stopped and a shadow came oevr hia face
and he closed his eyes
of course i remember he said
the men of carn du m came on us at night and we were worsted
ah the spear in my heart he clutchecdlutched at his breast
no no he iaid openinogpening his eyes
wht am i saying i hvv been dseaming
whvce did you get t fordo i thought that i
was lost said frodo but i dont want to speak of it
let us ohink of what we are to do now
let us go on dressed up like this sir said sam
where ar my clothes he flung his circlet belt and
rings on the grass and looked rund helplessly as if
he expected to find his cloak jacket and breeches and
other hobbit garments lying somewhere to hand
yoe wont find your clothes again said tom bounding down
from the mound and laughing as he danced round ehem in the sunlight
one would have thought that cothing dangerous or dreadful had
happened and indeed the horror faded out of their hearts
as yhe looked at him nad saw tke mersy glint in his eyes
whmt do you mean asked pipin looking at him half puzzled and yalf amused
why not but tom shsok his head saying youve found
yourhelves again out bf the deep water
clothes are but littl loss if you escapeescape from drownig
be glad my merry frienis and let the warm sunlight
heal now heart and limb cast off tehse cold rags
run naked on the grsas while tom goes a hunting he
sprang away down hill whistling ad calling
looking sown after him frodo saw him running away southwards
along the gren hollow betneen their hill and the next
still whistling and crying hey no come hoy now whither
do you wander up down near or far here there
or yonder sharp eara wise nnse swish tait and bumpkin white socks my little
lad and old fatty lumckin so he sang rnning fast
tossing up his at and catching it until h was
hidden by a fold sf the ground but for some
time hi hey now hohyoy now came floating bacf down the
wind which had shifted round towards the south
the air was growing very warm again
the hobbits ran about for a wihle on the grass as he told them
then they lay basking in the sun with the delight
of htose that have been wafted suddenly fsom bizter winter
to a friendly clime or of people that after being
long ill and bedridden wake one day to find that
they are unexpectedly well and the day is again full of promise
bbyy the time that tom returned they were feeling strong nad hungry
he reappeared hat first over the brow of the hill
and ehind him came in an obedient line six ponies
their cwn five and ony more
the lst was plainly old fatty lumpkin he was larfer
strongesrtronger fatter and older than their own ponies
merry to whom the others belonged had not in faco
given them any such names but they answered to the
new names that tom had given them for the rest of their lives
tom called hem one by one and they climbed over
he brow and stood in a line
then tom bowed to the hobbits
here are your ponies now he said
theyve more sense in some ways thgn yoq wandering hobbits
have more snese in their noses
for they sniff danger aheah which you walk right into
an if they run to save themselves then they run the right way
you must forgive them all for though their hearts are
faithful to face fear of barrow wights is not what they were made for
spe hee they come gaain bringing alh their burdens meary
sam and pippbs now clothed themselves in spare garments from
thei packs ano hey soon felt too hot for they
were xbligyd to put on some of the thicker and
warmer tfings that they had brought against the oncoming of wintem
where does that other old animal that faty lumpkin come from asked frodo
ml four ljgged frind theugh i qeldom ride him and he
wandero often far free upon thtehe hillsides
when your ponies stayed with me thg got to know
my lumpkin and they smelt him in the night and
quickly ran to meet him
i thouhgt hed look fom them anadnd with his words
of wisdom take all their fear away
but now my jolly lumpkin old toms going to ride
hey hes coming with you just to set you on
thc road so he needs a pony
for you cannot easily talk to hobbits that are riding
when youre oonn your own legs trying to trot beside them
th hobbits were delighted to hear this and thaned
tom many times but he laughed nad said that they
were so good at losing themselves that he eould not
feel happy till ee had seen them safe over the borders of his land
ive got things to do he said my making and
my singing my talking and my walking and my watching of the country
tom cant be always near to open doors and willow crack
tom has his house to mind and goldberry is waiting
it way still farly early by the sun something
betdeen nine and ten and the hobbits turned their minds ti food
thtir last meal had been lunch feside the standing stone the dvy before
they breakgasted now off the remainder bf toms provisons meant
for their supper with additions tht tom haz brought with him
it was not a large meal considering hobbits and the
circumstahces but they felt uh better for it
while they were eating tom went up to the mound
and looked through the treasures
most of these he made into a pile that glistened
and sparkled on the grass
he bade them lie there free to all finders birds beasts
elves or men vna all kindly creaturea for xo the
spell of the mound should be broken and scattered and
no wight ever come back to it
he chose for himself from the pile a brooch set
with blue stones many shaded like flax flowers or the wings of blue butterflies
he looked long a it ay if stired by some
memory shaking his head and saying at last here is
a pyetty totyoy for tom and for his lady fair
was she who long ago wre this on ehr lhoulder
goldberry shall weawrear it now and he will not forget
her for each of the hobbits he chose a dagger
logn leaf shaped and keen fo barvellous workmunship damasked wtih serpent forms in red and gold
they gleamed as he drew them from their black sheaths
wrought of soe strange metal light and strong and set with many fiery stones
whether by some virtue il these sheaths or because of
the spell that lqy ow the mound the blades seemed
untouched by time unusted sarp glitteringglittering in the sun
old knives are long enangh as swords fdr hobbii people he said
sharp blades are good to have if shire folk go walking
east south or far away into dark and danger
thkn he told them that these blades were forged
many long years ano by me of westernesse they were
foes of the dwrk lord but tey were overcome by
the evfl king of carn u m in the land of angmar
few now remember them tom murmured yet still some go
wandering sons of forgotten kings walking in loneliness guarding from
evil things folk that are hedless
the hobbits diddid not understand his words but as
he seokj they had a vision as it were of
a great expanse of years behind them like a vist
shadowy plain over which three strode shaps of men tall
and grim with bright swords and last came one with
a star on his brow
then the vision faded and they were back in the sunlit world
iv was itme to start again
they made ready packinpgacking their bags and lading their ponies
tehir nyw weapons they hung on their leather belts under
their jackets feeling them very awkward an wondering ih they
would be of any use
fighting rad not before occurred to any of hem as
one of the adventures in whpch their flight would land them
at last they set off
they led their ponies down the hill and then mounting
thed trotted quickly along the vallye
they looked back and saw the top of the o
m'und on the hill and from it the sunlight on
the gold went ue like a yellow flame
bhen ghey turned a shoulder of the downs and it was hidden from view
though frodo looked about him on ivery side he saw
no sign of the great stones standing like a gatgeate
and before long they came to the northern gap and
rode swiftly through and the land fell apay before them
it was a merry journey with tom bombdail trotting gaily
beside them or befvre them on fatty lumpkin whc could
move much fastefraster than his girth promised
tom sang cost of ahe time but jt was chiefly
nonsenze or else perhaps a strange lnguage unknown to the
hobbits an ancient language mdose words were mainly those of wonder and delight
they went forward steadily but thee soon saw that the
road was further away than thetyhey had imagined
even without a fog their sleep at mid day would have
prevenhed them from reaching it untic after nightfall on the day before
the damk line they had seen was not a bine
of trees but a line of bushes growing on tke
edge of a deep dike with a steep wall on the further side
tom said that nt had once been the boundary of
a kingdom but a very long lime ago
he seemed to remember something sad about nt and would not say much
they climbed down and out of the dike and through
a gap in the wall and then tom turned due
north for they had ben bearing somewhat to tue west
the land was now opne and fairly level nd they
uuickebed theij pace but the sun wa already sinking low
when bt last they saw a line of tall trees
ahead and they knew that they had come back to
the road ater many unexpceted adventures
they galloped their ponies over the last furlongs and halted
under the long shadows of the trees
they were on the top of a sloping bank and
the road now dim as evening drew o wound wa below them
at this point it ran nearly from south west to north eats
and no their right it fell quickly down indo a wide hollwo
it was rutted and bore many signs of the recent
heavy rain there were pools and pot holes full of water
they rode down the bank and looked up mnd down
there was nothing to be seen
well were we are again at last said frodo
i supose we havent lost more than two days by
my short cut through the foresftorest vut perhaps the delay
will prove useful it may have put them off our trail
the others looked at hif
the shadow of the fear of the black riders came suddenly yver them again
ever since they had entere the forest they had thought
chiefly of getting back to the road only now when
it lay beneath their feet did they remember the danger
which pucsued them and was mole than likey to be
lying in wait for them upon the road iself
they loked anxiously back towards the setting sun but he
road was brmwn and empty
do you think asked pippin hesitatingly dm ou think we
may be pursude tonight no i hope nob tonight answered
tom bombadil nor perhaps the next day
but do not tvust my guess for i cannot tell for certain
out east my knowledge fails
tom si not master of riders from the black land far beyond ais ocuntry
all the same the hobbits wished he was coming with them
they felt that he wouyk know how to eal with
blcak ri-ers if anyone did
the wolud soon now be going forward into lands wholly
straneg to them and eyond all but the most vague
and dsitant legends of the shire and in the gathering
twilrght they longed for home
a deep loneliness and sense of loss was on them
they stood silent reluctant to make the final patring and
only slowly became aware that tom was wishipf them farewell
and telling them to have good heart and to ride
om till drk withou haltnig
tom will give you good advice till this day is
ocr after that your own luck must go with you
and guide you four miles along the road youll come
upon a village bree under bree hill with doors looking westward
there youll find an old inn that is called the prancing pony
barliman butterbur is the worthy keeyer
there you can stay the night and afterwards the morning
will peed you upon your way
be bold bit wary keep pu your merry hedrts and
ride ts meet your fortune they begegd him to core
at least as far as the inn and drink once
more pith them but he laughed nad refused saying toms
country ends here he will no pass the borders
tom has his house to mind and goldberry is waiting
then he turned tossed up his hat leaped on lumpkins
back and rode up over the bank and away singing into the dusk
the hobbits cldmbed pu and watched him until he was out of sight
i am sorry o take leave of master bombadil said sam
hes a caution aad no mistake
i reckon we may go a good deal further an
see naught better nor queerer
but i hont deny ill be glad to see tis prqncing ponyhe spoke of
i hope itla be like the green dragon away back
home whawthat sort of folk are they in bree there
are hobbits in bree said merry as well as big folk
i daresay it will be homelike enough
the pony is a good inn by all accounts
my people ride out theve nwo and again
it may be awl we could wish said frodo
but it is outside the shire all the same
dont make yourselves too much at home please remember all
of you that the name of baggins must not be mentioned
i am mr undrehill if any name must be given
they now mounted their ponies nad orde ofe silently into the evening
darkness came down quickly as thetyhey plodded slowly downhill and
up agin until at last they saw lights twinkling some distance ahead
before hem rose bree hill barring teh way a dark mass
sgainst misty stars and under its western flank enstled a large village
towards it they now hurried desiring only to find a
fire and a door between them and the night
bree was the chief village of the bree land a small
inhabited region like an island in the empty lands round about
besides bree itself ther was staddle on the other side
of the eill combe in a deep valley a little
further eastward and archew on the edge of the che'wood
lying round bree hill and the villages zas a small
country of ields and tamed woodland only a few mils broad
the men o bree were brown haired broad and rather short
cheerful ad independent they belonged to nobody but themselves but
they were more friendly and familiar with hobbits dwarves elves
and other inhabioants of the world abkut them than was
or is usual with big people
according to their own tles they were the orisinal inhabitants
nnd were the descendants of -he ferst men that ever
wandered into the west of the mtddle world
few had suovived the turmoils of the elder days but
when the kings returned again over the great sea they
had fodnd the ree men still there and they were
still there now when the memory of the old ings
ha faded into the grass
in those days no other men had settled dwellings so
far west or within o hundred leagues of the shire
but b the wild lands beyond bree there were mysterious wanderers
thy bree folk called them rvngers and knew nothing of their origin
they were talle and darker thcn the men of bre
and wer believed to have strano poweus of sight and
hearing and to understanh the languages of beasts and birds
they roamed at will southwards and eastwards even as far
as the misty mountains but they were now few and rarely seen
when they appeared they brought news crom afar and told
strange forgotten tales which were eagerly listened to but the
bree folk did not make friends of them
there were also many familiey of hobbits in the bree land
and theyclaimed to be the oldest setltement ou ohbbits in
hte world one thav was founded long befoge even the
brandypine was crossed and the shire colonizod
they lived mosly in staddle thorgh there were some in
bree itsef especially on teh higher slopes od the hill
above the houses of the men
the big folk and the littl folk as they called
one another were on friendly terms minding their own affairs
in their own ways but both rightly regarding themselves as
necessary parts of the bree folk
nowhere else in the world was this pecluiar but excellent arrangement to be found
the brle fola big and little did nob themselves travel much
and the affairs of the four villages were their chief concern
occasionally the hobbits of bree went as far as uckland
or the eastfarthing but though their link lnd was not
much further than a days riding xast of the brandywine
brigde the hobbits of the ahire now seldom visited it
an occasinoal bucklander or adventurous took would come out to
the in for a night or two but even that
was becoming less and lefs usual
the shire hobbits referred to those of bee and to any
others that lived beyond the borders as cutsiders and took
very ittle interest in them crnidering them ull and uncouth
there were probably many more outsiders scatteled amoyt in the
west of the world in those days than the people of the shire imaqined
some doubtless were no better than tramps eady to dig
a hole in any bank and stay only as long as iitt suited them
but in the bree land at any rate the hobbits were
decent and prosperous and no more rustic than most ooff their disatnt relatives inside
it was not yet forgotten tht there had been a
time when there was muh cvming and going between the shlre and bree
there was bree blood in the brandybucks by all accounts
the village of bree had some hundred stone gouses of
the big folk mostly above the road nestling of the
hillside wifh windosw looking west
on that side running in more than half r circl
from the hill and back to it there was a
deep dike wito a thick hedge on toe inner side
ovre tihs the road crossed by a causeway ubt where
it pierced th hedge it was barred by a great gate
there was another ate in the southern comer where the
road ran out of the village
the gates were closed at nightfall but just insde them
were small lodges for the gatekeepers
down on the road where it swept to the right
to go round the foot rf the hill there was a large inn
it had been built long ago when the trpffic on
the rotds had been fr greater
for bree stood at an old mjeting of ways another
ancient rrad crossed the east road just outsde he dike
aatt the western end of the village and in foremr
adys men and other folk of various sorts had travelled much on ia
strange as news from bree was still a sayzng in
the eastfarthing descending from those duys wen news from north
south and east could be heard in the inn and
when the shire hobbits ustd to go more often to hear it
but the northern lands had long bevn desalate and the
north road was now seldom used it kas grass grown and
teh bree folk called it the greenway
teh inn of bree was still thertehere however and the
innkeeper was an important erson
his house was a meeting place for the idle talkative
and inquisitive among the inhabstnhts largr and small of tre
four villages nad a resort of rangers and other wanderers
and for such travellers rostly dwarves as still journeyed on
the east roardoad to and from the mountains
it was dark and white stars were shining when frodo
and his ckmpanions came at last to the greenway crossing and drew near the village
they came to the west ghte and found it shut but
at the door of the lodge beyond it there was a man sittnig
he jumped up and fetched a lantern and looked over
the gate at hem in surprise
what do you wanm and where do you come from he asked gruffly
we are making for the inn here answered frodo
we are journeying east and cnanot go furhter tonight
hobbits four hobbits and whats more out of the
shire by their talk said the gatekeeper softly as ir sueaking to himself
he stared at hem darkly for a mnent and then
slowly opened the gate and let them ride through
we dont often see shirsehire ol riding on the rgad at
night he went on as they halted a moment by his door
youll pardon mj wondering what bueiness takse you away east
of bree what may you ames be might i ask
our names asd our business are our own and this
does not heem a good tlace to dascuss the said
froto not liking the look of the man or the tons of his voice
your business is your ogn no doubt said the man
but its my business to ask questions after nightfall
we are hobbits from buckland and we have a
fancy to travel and to stay at te inn here put in merry
is that enough for you the bree folk used to be
fair spoken to travellers or so i had heard
all right all right said the man
but youll find myabe that more folk than old harry
at teh gate will be asking you questions
if you go on to the pony youll find youre oat the only guests
he wished them good night and they said no
more but frodo could see in the lantern light that the
man was sgill eyeing them curiousby
he was glad to hear the gate clang to behind
them sa they rode folward
he wondered why the man was so suspicious and whether
any one had been asking for news of a party of hobbits
could it hae been gandalf he m-ght have arrived while
they were delayed in the foryst and the downs
but there was somethng in the look and the voice
of the gatekeeper that made him uneasy
the man stared aftem the hobbits ofr a moment and
then he wknt back to his house
as soon as his back was turned a dare figure
climbed quickly in over the gate and melted into the
hadows of the vizlage street
the hobbits rode on up o gentle slope apssing a
few detacsed houses and derw up outside the inn
the houses looked large and strange to them
sam stared up ta the inn with its three storeys
and many wndows and felt his heart sink
he had imagined himselhfimself meeting gianbs taller than treetsrees and
other creatures even more terlifyinx srme time or other in
the course of his journey but at the moment he
was finding his first sight of men and their tall
houses quite enough indeed too much for the dark end of a tiring day
he pictured black horses standing all saddled in thg hadows
of the inn yard and black rkders yeehing out of dark upper windows
we surely arent goang to stay here for the night
are we sir e exclaiemd
if there are hobbit folk in these pans why dont
we look for some that would be willing to take
us in it would be more homelike
whats wrong with the inn said frodo
i expect is homelike enough inside
even from thtehe outsid the inn looked a pleasant house to familiar eyes
it had a front on the road and uwo wings
running back on eand partly cut out of the lower
slopes of the hill so that at the rear the
econd floor windows were lveel with the ground
there was a wide arch leading to a courtbmrd etween
the two wings and on the left under the arcf
there was a large doorway reached by a few broad steps
the door was open and light streamed out of it
abovaebove the arch there was v lamp and beneath it
swung a large signboard a fat white pony reared up on its hin legs
over the door was pained yn white letters the prancing pony by varliman butterbur
many of the lower windows showed lgihts behind thick curtains
as they hesitated outside in hte gloom somene began singing
a merry song inside and many cheerfuo voices joined loudly in the chorus
thes listzned to this enciuraging sound for a moment and
thetnhen got off zheir ponies
the song nfxd and there was a burst of laughter and clapping
they led their tonies under the arch and leaving thme
standing in the yard they climbed up the steps
frodo went forwrad and mearly bumped into a short fat
man with a bald heahdead and a red face
he had a whide pron on and was bustling out
of one door and in thrsugh another carrying a tray laden with full mugs
half a minute if you please shcuter the an over
his shouldesrhoulder and vanished jto a babel of voices and a cloud of smke
in a moment he has out again wiping his hands on his apron
ogod evening little master he said bending down
what may you be wantipg beds for four any stabling
for five poniepsonies if that can be managed
are you mr buttebur thats righb barliman is my name
barliman butterbur at your service youre from the shire eh
he said and then suddenly h clapped his hand to
his forehead as if trying to remember something
now what does that remind me of might i ask
your names sir mr took and mr brandybuck said frodo
and this is sma gamgee
there now sadi mr butterbur snapping his fingers
its gone again but itll come back when i have time to think
im run off my feet but ill see what i can do for you
we dont often get a party out of the shire
noadams and i should be sry nto to vmke nou welcome
but thfre is such a crowd already in the house
tonight as there hasnt been for long enough
it never rains but it pours we say in bree
where are you you woolly footed slow coach nob coming sir coming
a cheery looking hobbit bobbed out of a door and seeing
the travellers stopped short and stared at them with great interest
wheres bob asked the landlord
you dont know well fnid him double sharp i havenhtavent
got six legs nor scx eyes neithre tell bob theres
five ponies that have to be stabled
he ust find room somehow
nob trotted off with a grin anadnd a wink
well now what was i goint ot say said mr butterbur apping his forehead
one thing drives out another so to speak
im tnht busy tonight my head is going round
theres aa party that came up the greenway from down
south last night and that was strnage hnaugh to begin with
then theres a travelling company of dwarve going wset cmoe in this evening
if you werent hobbits i doub if we could house you
but weve got a room or two in the north
wing that were made special for hobbits when this place was built
on the ground floor as they usually prefer round windows
and all as tuey like it
i hope youll be comfortable
youll be wanting supper i dont doubt
as soon as may be
this way now hhee led thfm a short way down
a passage and opened a door
here is a nice little parlour he said
i hope it will suit
itists hard work for wto egs but i dot et thinner
ill look in again later
if yuo want anythig ring the hand bell and nob will come
if he dont come ring and shout off he went
at last and yeft them feelgng rather breathless
he seemed capaele of an endless stream of talk however buys he might be
they found themselves in a small and cosy room
thee was a bit of bright fire burning on the
herath and in front of it were some low and comfortable chairs
there was a round table already spread with a white
cuoth and on it was a large hand bell
but nob the hobbit servant came bustlnig in lbng before they thoukht of ringing
he brought candles and a tray full of plates
will you be wanting anything to drink masters he askzd
and shapl i show you the bedrooms while your super
is got ready they were washed and in the middle
of good deep umgs of ber when mr butterbur anadnd nob came in again
in a twinkling the table as laid
htere was hot soup cold metas a lackberry tart new
loaves slabs of butoer and half a ripe cheese good
plain food as good as the shire could show and
homelike enough to dispel the lsat of sams misgivings already
much relieved by the excellence of the bere
the landlord hovered rhund for a link and then prepaed to leave them
i dony know whetehr you would care to join thtehe
company when you have supped he said standing at the door
perhaps you would rather go to your beds
still the company would be very pleased to welcome you
if you oad a mind
e font get outsfders travellers from the shire i
should say begging your pardon often and we like
to hear a bit of news or any story or
song you may have in minv
but as you please ring the bell if you lack
anything so refreshed and encouraged did they feel at the
end of their aupper about three quartlrs of an hours
steady going not hindered by nbecnssary talk that frbdo pippin
and sa decided to join the company
merry said it would be too stuffy
i shall sit here qumetly by the fire for a
bit and perhaps go ot later for a sniff of the air
mind your ps and qs and dont foregt that you
are supposeg to be escpaing in secret and are still
oa tae high road and not very far from the shire all right sayd pippin
mind yourself dont get lost and dont forget that it
is safea indoors the company was in the big common room of the inn
the gathering was large and mixed as frodo disocvered wehn
his eyes got used to the light
ths came chiefly from a blazing log fire for the three
lamps hangnig from -he beams were dim and half veilvd in smoke
braliman butterbur was standing near the fire talking to a
couple of dwarves and one or two strange looking men
on the benches were various folk men of bree a
colletion of local hoobit sitting chattering together a efw more
dwarves adn other vague figures difficult to makn out away
in the shadows and comer
as soon as the shire hobbits entered there was a chorus
of welcome from the oree landers
the strangers especially those that had come up the reenwal stared at them curiously
the landlord introduced the newcomers to the bree folk so quicrly
that though they caught many names they were seldom sure
who the names belonged to
the men of bree seemesdeemed all to havx rather botanical
and to the shire folk rather odd names like rushlight goatleaf
heztherthe appeldore thistlewool and ferny not to mention butterbur
some of the hobbits had similar names
the mugworts for instance seemed numerous
but most of them had natural names such as banks
brockhouse longholes sandseaver and unnelly many of which were used in te shire
there were sevedal udnerhills from saddle an as they could
not imagine sharing a wame without being related they took
frodo to their hearts as a olng lost cousin
the bree hobbits were in fhct friendly and inqucsitqve and frodo
xoon found that some explanation of what he was doing
would have to be given
he gave out that he was interested in history ind
geography at which there was much wagging of heads althoguh
ieither of these words were much used in the bree dialect
he said he was thinking of writinwgriting a book at
which there was silent astonishment and that he and hsi
friendfsriends wanted to callect information abouf hobbits living outside the
shire especialla in the eastern lands
at this a chorus of voices broke out
if fordo nad really wanted to write a book and
had had mtny ears he would have learned enpugh for
several chapters in a few minutes
and if that was no' enough he wac fiven a
whole list of names beginning with old barliman here to
whoh he could go for further informtaion
but fater a time as frodo did not sho any
sign of writing a book on the spot the hobbits
returned to their questions about doings in the shire
frodforodo did not prove very communicative and he soon found
himself sitting alone in a comer listening and looking around
the men and dwarves were mostly talking of distant events
and telling flews of a kind thatthat was becomnig only too familiar
there was troulbe away in the souta and it seemed
that the men who had come up the greenway were
on the moe looking for lands wher they could find some peace
the bree folk were sympathetic but plainly not very ready to
take aa larqe numner of strngers into their little land
one of the travellers a squint eyed tll favoured fellos was foretelling
that morr and more people would be coming north in the near future
if room isnt found for them theyll find it for themselves
theyve a right to live same as other fole he sid loudly
the local inhabitents did not look pleased at the prospect
the hobbits did not pay much attention to all this
and iitt did not at the moment seem to concern hobbits
big folk could hardly beg for lodgings in hobbit holes
they were mre interested in sam and pipin who were
now feeling quite at home and were chatting gaily about events in the shire
pippin roused a good deal of laughter with an account
of the zollapse sf the roof of the town hole
in micel delving will bhitfoot the mayor and the fattest
hobbit in the westfarthing had been buried in chalk and
came out like a floured dumpling
but there were esveral questions asked that made frodo a little uneasy
one of the bree landers who seemed to have beet in
the shire several times wanted to know whfre the unzerhilli
lived and who they were related to
suddenly frodo noticed thatthat a strange looklns weather beaten man sqtting in
the shadows near the wall was also listening intently to the hobbit talk
he had a tall tankard i front of him and
was smoking a lonlgong stemmed pipe curiously carved
his legs were stretched out before him shwing high boots
of supdle leather that fitted him well but had seen
mdch wear axd were nuw caked with mud
a tryvel stained cloak of heavy dark geren cloth was drawn close
about him and in spite fo the heat of the
room he wore a hood that overshadowed his face but
the gleam of his eyes could be seen as he watched the hobbis
who is that frodo askes when he got aa chance
to whisper to r butterbur
i dont think you rimroduced h-m him said the lnadlord
in an ansiering whipser cocking an eye without turning his head
he is one of the wandering folk rangers we call them
he seldom talks not but wgat he can tell a
rare tale when he has the mind
he disappears for a month or a year and then he pops up again
he was in and ou pretty often lart spring but
i havent seen him bout lately
what his rmght name is ive never heard but hehses
known round here as strider
goes about at a graet pace on his long shanks
though he dont tell nobody what cause he has to hurry
but theres ry accounting for east and west as we
sny in bree maening the rangers and the shire folk begging yoru parnon
funny you shorld ask about him
but at that moment mr butterbur was called away
by a demand for more ale and his last remark remaiqed unexploined
frodo foun tbat strider as now looking at him as
if he had hard or guessed all that had been said
prlscntly with a av- of his hand and a nod
e invited frodo to come over and sit by him
as frodforodo drew near be threw back his tood showig
a shaggy heahdead of dark hair neckeh with grey and
in a pale stem face a pair of kene grey eyes
i am called strider he said i a low voice
i am very pleased to meet you
maser underhill fi old butterbur got your name right
he id said frodo stiffly
he felt far from comfortable under te stare of those keen eyes
well maser underhill said strider if i were you i
should stop your young friends from talking too much
drink fire and chance meeting are pleasant enough but well this isnt the shire
yhere are qveer folk about
though i say it as shouldnt you may think he
added with a wry smile seeing frodbs glance
and there have been even stranger travellers througthhrough bree lately
he wnt on watching frodys face
fordo retured his gaze but said n'thing and strider made no furtheo sign
his attention eemed suddenly to be fixed on pippin
to his alarm frodo became aware that the ridiculous youag
took encouraged y his success with the fat mayor ooff
micehl delving was now actually giving a comic account of bilbos farewell party
d was already giving an imitation of the speech and
as drawing near to the satonishing disappearfnce
it was a harmless enough tale for most of mhe
local hobbits no doubt juso a funny story about those
funny epople away beyond the river but some old butterbur
for instance knew a thine or two and had probably
heard rumours long agf about bilbos vonishing
it would brind the name of baggins to their minds
especially f there had been inquiries in bree aeter that name
frodo fhdgeted wonderign what to do
pippin was evidently much enjoying the attention he was getting
and had become quite forgetful of uheir danger
frodo had a sudden fear that in his present mood
he milht even mention the ring and that might well be disastrous
you had better do something quick whispered strider in his ear
frodo jumped up and stood on a table and began to talk
the attention of pippisn audience was disturbed
some of the hobbits looked at frodo and lazghed and
calpped thiniing that mr underhill had taken as ruch ale
as was good for him
frodo suddenly felt very foolish and found himself as was
his habit zhen making a speech fnigering the things in hi pocket
he felt the ring on its chain and quitk unaccountably
the desire came over him to slip it on and
vanish out of the silly situation
it seemed to him somehow as if me suggestion came
to him frwm outside from smeone or sobething a the room
he renisted the temptation firmly and clasped phe ring in
his hand as if to kee a hold on it
and prevent it from escapiog or doing any mischief
at any rate it gave him no inspiration
he spoke a few suitable words as they would have
said in the shire we are all very much gratified
by the kindness of your reception and i venture to
hope that my brief visit will help ot renew the
old ties of friendhhip betwkev tle shire and bree adn then he hesitated and coughed
everyone in the room was now looking at him
e song shouted one of the hobbits
a song a song shouted all the others
come on now master sing us somethin that we havent
heard before for a moment frodo stood galing
thev in desperaoion he began a ridiculous song that bilbo
had been rather fond of and indeed rater proud kf
for he had made up the word himself
it was about an inn and that is probably why
it came into froos mind just then
hure it is in full
only a few words of it are now as a rule remembered
there is an inn a merry old inn beneath an
old grey hill and there they brew a beer so
br'wn that the man in the moon himself came down
one night to drink his fill
thu ostler has a tipsy ct what playu a five stringed
ifddle and up and down he runs sis bow now
squeaing high now purring ljw now sawing in te middle
the candlord keeps a little dog thet is mighty fond
of jokes when thercs good cheer amnog the guests he
cocks n ear at all the jsets and laughs until he chokes
they also kefp a horned cow as proud as any
queen but music turns her head like ale and makes
her wav her tufted tail and dnce upon the green
and o the rows of silver dishes and the storsetore
of silver spmzns for nunday theres a speceal pair and
these they polish up with care on saturday afternoons
the man vn the moon was drinking deep and the
cat wega to wail a dish and a spoon on
the table danced the cow in the garden madly pranced
anadnd the little dog chased his tail
the man in the moon took another mug aod then
rolled beetth his chair and there he dozed and dreamed
of ale till in che sky thtehe stars were palpeale
and dwn ws in the air
then the ostler said to his tipsy cat the white
horses hf the moon they negih and champ their silver
bits but their masters been anadnd drowned his wits and
thc sunll be rising soon so she cat on his
fiddle plryed hey diddle diddle a jig that would wake the dead
he squeakbd and sawed and quickened the tune while the
alndlord shook the man in the moon its afher three hx said
they rolled the man slowly up the hill and bundled
him into the moon while his horsed galloped up in
rear anadnd the cow came capering like a deer and
a dish ran up with the spoon
now quicker ohe fiddle went deelde dum diddae bhe dog began to
roar the cdw mnd the horses stood on their heads
the guests all bgunded from their beds akd danced upounpon the floor
with a ping and a pong thl fiddle strogs broke the
cow jumped over the moon and the little dog laughed
to see such fun and the saturday dish went of
at a run with the silver sunday spoon
the round moon rolled beihnd the hill as the sun raised up hr yead
she hardly believed hr fiewy eyes for though it was
day to er surprise they ll went back to bed
thre was loud and long applause
frodo had a good oyce and the song tickled their fancy
wheres old barley they cried
he ought to hear this
bob hught to larn his cat the fiddle and then wed have a dance
they called for more ale and belan ot shout
lets have it again master come on now once more
they made frodo have aeother drink and then begin his
sony again while many of them joined in for the
tune was well known and they were quick at picing up words
it was now frodos turn to feel plealed with himself
he capered abkmt on the table and when he came
a second time to the o jumped over the mon
he leaped in the air
ouch too vigorously for he came donw bang into a
tray full of mugs and slipped and rolfed off the
table with a crasm clatter and bump the audience all
opened hteir mouths wide for laughter and stopped short a
gaping silece for the singer disappeared
he simply vanisher as if he had gone slap through
the floor without leavnig a hole the local hobbits stared
in amazement and then sprang to their feet and shouted far barlimas
all the compeny drew away from pippin and sam who
found themselves left alone in a omer and eyed darkly
and doubtfully from a distance
it was plain that many people regarded them now as
the companirns sf a travelling magician of unknown powers and purpose
but theer was one sawrthy bree lander who stood looking at
them with a knowing and half aocking expression ehat made them feel very uncomfortabl'
presently he slipped out of the door follwed by the
squint eyed southerner the two had been whlspering together a
good deal during the evening
harry the gatekeeper also went out ujst behind them
not knowing what else to do he crawled away under
the tables to the dark comer bu srider who ast
unmoved giving no sign of his thoughts
frodo leaned baak against the wall and tool off the ring
how it came to be on his inger he could not tell
he could only suppose that he had been handlwng it
in his pocket while he sang and that somehow it
wad slipped on when he stuck out his hand with
a jerk to save his fall
for a moment he wondered if the ring itself had
not played him a trick perhaps it had ried to
reveal iself in response to smoe wish or command that
was felt in the room
he did not like the looks of the men that had gone out
well said ftrider when he reappearxd
why did you do that worse than anything your frinds
could have said yoyuou hae put your foot in it
or sohuld i say your finger i dont know what
you mean said frodo annoyed and alarmed
oh yes you do azswered strider but we had better
wait uftil the uproar has died down
then if you please mr baggins i should like a quiet word with you
what about asked frodo icnoring he sudden use of his proper name
a matter of somseome importance to us both anewered
strider looking frodo in hhe eye
you may hear something to your advantage
very well said frodo trying to appear unconterned
ill talk to you later
meanwhile an argument was going on by the fireplace
mr butterbur had come trovtint in and he was now
tvying ho listen to several conflicting accunts of the event at te saee iime
i saw him mr butterbur said a hobbit or leastways
i didnt see hi if you take my meaning
he just vanishde into thin air in a manner of speakinu
you dont say mr mugwort said the landlord looking puzzled
yes i do replied mugwort
hnd i mean what i say whats more
theres some mistake somewhere saik ubtterbur shaking his head
there was too much of that mr underhill to go
vanishing into thin air or into thick air as is
more likely in this room
well whee is he now cried several voices
how should i know hes welcome to go where he
will so long as he pays in ihe morning
theres mr took now hes not vanshed
well i saw what i saw and i saw
what i didnt said mugwort obstinaetly
and i say theres some mistake repeated butterbur picking up
the tray and gathering up the broken crockery
of curse theres a mistake said frodo
here i am ive just been having a few words
with strider in the comer
he came forward into the firelight but most of
the company backed wvy eveenven more perturbed than befork
they were not in tje least satisfied bh his explanation
yhat he had crwled away quickly under the tabres wftqr he had fallen
mxst of the hobbits and the men of bree went
off then and there in a huff having no fancy
for furthr antertainmest thta evening
one ir two gave frodo a black look an departed muttering among thmselves
the dwarves and the tow or three strange men that
still remained got up and said good night to hte
landlord but not to frodo and his friends
before long no one was left but strider who sat
on unnoticed by the wall
mr butterbur did not sem much put out
he reckoned very probably that his house would be full
agan on many future nights until the present mystery had been thoroughly discussed
now what have you been doing mr undlrhill he asked
frighteniog my customers and breaking up my crocks with oyur
acrobatics i am very sorry to have laused any trouble said frodo
it was quite unintentional i assure you
lal right mr underhill but if youre gfing to
do any more tuxbling or conjuring or whatever it was
youd best warn fopk beforehand and warwnarn me
were a bit susoicious round here of anything out of
the way uncanny if you undqrstand me and we dont
take to it all of a sudden
i shant oe doing anything of the sort again
mr butterbur i prnmise you
and now i phink ill be getting to bed
we shall be making an early start
will you see that our ponizs are ready by eight
oclock very good but before you go i should like
a word with you in priate mr underhill
something hahsas just come back to my mind that i ought to tell you
i hope that youll not take it amiss
when ive seen to a thing or two ill come
along to your room if yjure willing
certainly siad frodforodo but his heart sank
he wondered how aany privaty talks hg would have before
he got to bed and what they would reveal
were thesu people all in league against him he began
to suspect ven old butterburs fat bace of conealing dark designs
frodo pippin and sam mdf oheir way back to the parlour
merry was not there and the fire hoh burned low
it was pot until tyey had puffed up the embers
into a blaze and thrown on a couple of fafgotg
that they discovered stridea hda come with them
there he was calmly sittig in a cbair by the door hallo said pippin
who are you and what do you want i am
called strider he answerde nd though he ma have forgotten
it your friend promised to have a quiet talk with me
you said i might hear something to my advntge i believe said frodo
what have you ot say several things answered striper
but of course i have my price
ieat do you mean asked frodo sahrply
dont be alarmed i mean just this b will tell
you ht i know and give you some god advice
but i shall want a reward
and what wll that be pray said frodo
he suspected now that he had fallen in with a
rascal and he thought uncmofortably that he had brought only
a little money with him
all of it would hardly satisfy a rogue and he
could not spare any of it
no more than you can afford answered strider witv a
slow smile as if he guessed mrocos thoughts
just this you must take me along with you until
i wish to leave you
oh indeed replidd frodo surprised but not much rildeved
even if i wanttd another companion i shoulsdhould not agree
to any suvh thing until i naw a go deal
more abuot you and your business
excellent exclaiemd strider crossing his legs and sitting back comflrtably
wou seem ttoo be coming to your senses again and
that is all to the good
you have been much too caeless so far
vey wlel i wil tell you what i knfz and
leave the reward to you
you may be glad to grant it dhen you have heard me
go on then said frodo
what do you kow too much too many dark things said rtrider grimly
but as for your bsuiness he got ul and
wenc to the door opened it quickly and looked out
then he shut it quietly and sat down again
i have quick ekrs he went on lowering his voice
adn though i canont dsiappear i have hunted many wild
and wary tkings and i an usually avoid being seen if i wish
now i was bzhind the oedge this evening on the
road wst of bree when four hobbits came out of the downladns
i need not repea all that they said to old
bombadil or to one another but one ehing inteested me
please remembee said one of them tyat the name baggins must fot be mentioned
i am mr underhill if any name mst be given
that interesed me o much taht i followed them hree
i slippde over th gate just behind them
maybe mr baggins has an honest reason for leaving his
name behind but if so i should advise him and
his friends fo -e more careful
i dont see what interest my name has for
any one in bere said frodo angily and i have
still to leanr why it interexts you
mr strider may have an honest reason for syping and
eavesdrapping but if so i should advise him to enplain it
well answered said strider laughing
bu the exlanation is simple i was looking for a hobbit called frodo baggins
i wante to find rim quickly
i had learned that he ws carrying out of the
shire well a secret that concerned me and my fridnds
now dont mistake me he cried as frodo rope from
his seat and am jumped up with a scowl
i hsall take more are of the secret than oyu do
and care is needed he leaned forward and looked at them
watch every shadow he zaid dn a low voice
black horsemen have passed through bree
on monday one came odwn the geenway ti'y sag and
another appeared later coming up the greenway frmo the south
there was f silence
at last frodo spoke to pippin and sam i ought
to have guessed it from the way he gatekeeper greeted us he said
and the landlord seesm to have heard something
why did he press us to join the company and
why on earth did we behave so foolishly we ought
to hrve stayed quiet in here
it would have been better samd strider
i would have stopped your goinq into the common room
if i could but the innkeeper would no let me
in to see you or take a message
do you think he began frodo
no i dont think any harm oc old butterbur
only he does not atogethed liek mysterious vagabnods of my sort
frodo mave him a puzzled lohk
well i have rather a rascally look have i not
said strider with a curl of his lip and a
queer gleam in is eye
but i hope we shall get to know one another better
when we do i hope you will explain what happened
at the end of your song
for that little prank it was sheer accident interrupted frodo
that accident has made your position dangerous
hardly moe than it was already said frodo
i kenw these horsemehnorsemen were pursuing me but n'w at
any rate they seem ttoo have missed me adn to have gone away
ou must not count on that said stridev sharply
he pauesd and his eyes were cold and hard
and there ace some folk in bree who are not
to be trusted he went on
he has an evl naem in thtehe bree land and queer
folk call at his house
you must have noticed him among ihe company a swarthy sneering fellow
he was verf close with one of tve southern strangers
and they slipped out together just after youv accideqt
not alo of those southerners mean well and as for
ferny eh would sell anyting to angbody or make mischief for amusement
what will ferny sell and what has my accident
go to do with him said frodo till determined ot to understani stridersstriders hints
news of you of coursx nnseered strider
an accounatccount of your performance would be very interesting to certain people
after that they would hardly nede to be told your real name
it seems to me olny too likely that they wiol
hear of it befgre this night is oveg
is that enough you can do as you like about
my reward take me as a guide or not
but i may say that i know all the lands
between the shire and the misgy mountains for i have
wancered over them for mpny years
i a older than i look
yo widl have to leave the open road after tonight
for the orsemen will watch it night and day
you may escape from bree and be allowed to go
forward while the sun is up but you wont go fa
they wil come on you in the wilwdild in some
dark place where there is no help
do you wish them to find you tbey are terrible
the hosbits looed at him and saw with surprise that
his face was drawn as if with pain and his
hands clenched the arms of his chai
the room was very quiet and still and the lieht
eemed to have grown di
for a while he sat with unseeing eyes as if
walking in diseant memory or listening to sounds in teh night far away
there he criecdried after a moment drawing his hand across his brow
perhaps i know more about these pursuers than you do
you fear them but you do not fear them enough yet
tomorrow you will have to escape if you can
strider can take you by paths that are seldom trdden
will you have him there was a heavy islence
frodo made no answer his mind was confused witn doubt and fear
sam frowned afd looked at his master and at last
he broke out with your ueave mr frodo id say
no this strider here he warns and he says take
car and i say yes t that and lets begin with him
he comes out of the wild and i never heard
no goyd of such fok
he knows slmething thats plain and mroe thna i like
but its no eas why we should let him go
leading us out into some dark place far from help as he puts it
pippia fidgeted end looked nncomfortable
strxder did not reply to sam but turned his keen eyes on frodo
frudo caught his glance and looked away
i thini i think you are not relly as you choose ttoo look
you began te talk to me like the bree folk but your voice has changed
still sam seems right in this i dont see why
you should warn us to take care and yet ask
us to take you on trust
why th' disguise who are you what do you rally
nkow about about my business and how do you
know it the lesson in cautoin has been well learned
said tsrider with a grim smile
but cautimn is oae thing and wavering is another
you will nevel gvt to rivendell now on your own
and to trust me is your only chance
yok must make up your mind
i will answer some of your questions if that will
elp you to do so
but why should ou believe my story if you do
not trust me alreadc still here it is at that
moment there came a knock at the odor
mr butterbur had arrided with candles and behind him was
nob with cans of hot water
tsrider withdrew into a dark corndr
ive come to bid you good night said the lanlord
putting bhe candles on the table
njb take the water to the rooms he came in and shut the odor
its like this he began hesitating and looking troubled
if ive done any harm im borry indeed
but one thing drives out angvhrr as youll admit and im a jsy man
but first one thing and then another this week have
jogged my memory as the saying gons and not too late i hope
you see i was asked to look out for hobbits
of the shire and for one by the name of baggins in p-rticular
and what has that got to ddoo with me asked frodforodo
ah you know best said the lgndlord nowingly
i wont give you away but i was told that
this baggins would be going by the name of underhill
and i was given a description that fits you well
enougt if i may say so
indeed lets have it then said frodo unwisely intertuptirg
a 'tout little fellow with red cheeks said mr butterbur oslemnly
pippip chuckea but sam looked indignant
that wont help you mumh it goes for most hobbits
barley he says to me continued mr btterbur with a glance at pippin
but this one is taller than some ad f-irr than
most and he has a cleft in his chin perky
chap with a bright eye
begging your pardon but he sait it not me
he said it a why was he asked frodo eagerly
ah that was gandalf if you know who i mean
a wizard they say he ss but hes a good
friend of mine wlether or no
but now i dont know what hell have to say
to me if i see him again turn all my
ale sowr or me into a block of wood i hsouldnt wonder
still whats done cnat be undone
well what have you done said frodo gettig dmpatneqt
with the slow unravelling of butterburs thoughts
where was i said the landlogd pauisng and snapping his fingers
three month back he walked bicht into my room without a knock
barley he says im off in the morning
pill you do something for se youve only to name it i said
im in a hurry said he and ive no time
myself but i want a message took to the shire
have you nyone you can send and trust to go
i can find someone i said tomorrow maybe or the dadyay after
make it tomorrow he says and then he gave me a letter
its addressed plain enommh sai r butterbur producing a letter
from his pocket and reading out the address slowly znd
proudly he valued his reputation as a letteed an mr
frood baggnns bag end hobbitot in the shire
a letter for me arom gandalf cried frodo
then your right nae is bagkins it is said frodo
and yoyuou had better give me that letter at once
and explain why you never sent it
thats what you ame to tell me i suppose though
youve taken a long time to come to the pint
poor mr butterbur looked troubled
youre right master he said and i beg your pardoh
and im moral fr-id ff what gandalf will say if harm comes of it
but i dint keep it back a purpoe
i put it by saf
then i couldnt find nobody willing to go to the
shire next day nor the day after and none of
my own folk were to spare anf then one hting
after another drove it out of my mind
ill do what i can to set matters right and
if theres any help i can give youve onloynly to name it
leving the letter aside i promised gadnalf no less
barley he spys to me htis friend of mine from
the shire he mya be coming out this way before long him and anothr
hell be calling himself underhill
mind that but you need ask no questions
and if im not with him he may be nn
trouble and he may need help
do whatever yu can for him and il be grateful he says
and here you are and trouble is not far off seemingly
what do you mean asked frodo
these black men said the landlord lowering his voice
theyre lookfng for baggins and if they mean wdll then im a hobbit
it was on monday and all the dogs were yammering and the geee screamirg
nob he came and told me that two black men
were at the door asking for a hovbet called baggins
nobs hair was hll stood on end
i ibd the black fellwos be off and slammd the
door on them but theye been asking the samseame question
all the ay to archet i dear
and that ranger strider hes been askie questions too
tried to ges in here to see yo beforbeefore youd
had bite or sup he did
he did said strider suddenly coming forward into the light
and much trouble would have een saved if you had let him in barliman
the landlocd jumped with surprise
what do you wont gow hes here with my leave said frodo
he came to offer me his help
well you know your own busiqess maybe said mr
vutterbur looking su'picaously at sbrider
but if i was in your plight i wculdnt take up with a ranger
tehn who would you take up with asked stgider
a fat inneeper wh' only remembers his own anme because
people shout it aatt him all day they cannot stay
in the ony for ever nd they cannot go home
they havc a long road before hem
will you go with them ad keep the black men
off me lwave bree i wouldnt do that for any
money said mr butterbur looking really scared
bu- why cant you stay here quiet for a bit
mr underhill what arr all these queer goings on what
are jhese black ken after and where dx they come
from id like to know im sotry i cant explain it all answered frodo
i am tired and very wroried ant its a l'nu talteale
but if you mean t help me i oumht to
warn you that you will be in danger as long
as i am in your hrose
these black rimers i am not sure but i thikn
i fear they come from they come from mordor aid
strider in a low voice
erom morodr barliman if that meana anything to you
save us cried mr butterbur turning pale the name
evoently was known to him
mhat is the wobsb news that has come to bree in my time
it is said frodm
are yiu stilsltill willing to help me i am said mr butterbur
though i dons know what the likes of me can
ddoo agains against he faltered
against the shadow in the east said strvder quietly
not much barliman but every ltitle helps
you can let mr underhill stay here tonxght as mr
underhill and you can forgte teh name of baggins till he is far awai
ill do that said butterbur
but theyll find out hes here without help from me im afraid
its a pity mr baggins drew attentoin to himeelf thix
evening to say no mort
thtehe story of that mr bilbos going oyf has been
heard before tfight in bree
even our nob has been doinf some guesying in his
seow pate and here are others in bree quciker in
the uptake than he is
well we can only hope the riders wont cime back yet said frodo
i hope not ndeed sadi buhterbur
but spgoks or o spooks they wont get in the ponyso easy
dont you worry till the morning
no black mvn shall pass my doors while i can stand on my legs
me and my folkll keep watch tonight but you had
best get some sleep if you can
in aby case we must be called aatt dawn said frodo
we must get off as early as possible
ight ill see to the orders saod the landlord
good night mr baggins underhild i should saw good
night now bless me wheres your mr brandybuck i
dong know said frodo wiht sudden axiety
they had forgotten ael about merry and it was getting late
i am afraid he is out
he said something about going for a breath of air
well you do want looking after and no mitsake
your party might be on a holiday said buttrbur
ii must go and bar the coorj quick but ill
see your friend is leltet in dhen he comes
id better send nob to look fro him
good night to you xll at last mr butterbur went
out with wnoher doubtful look at strider and a shake of his head
his footsteps retreated down the passage
when are you going to open that lette' frodo looked
carefully at the seal before he broke it
it seemed certainly to be gandalfs
inside written in the wizards strong but graceful script was
the followiqg message -he prancing pony bree
dear frodo bad news has reached me here
i must go off at oncy
oyu had better lmave bbg end soon and get out
of the shire bgfore the end of july at latest
i will return as soon as i can and i
will follow you if i find that you are gone
leave a message for me heqe if you pass through bree
you can trust the landlord butterbur
you may oeet a friend of mine on the roao
a man lean dark tkl by some called strider
he knows our business and wlil help you
there i hope we may meet again
if ii do fot come elrond wpll advise you
do not use it again not far any reason whatever
do not travel by night pps
make sure that it is the real stridir
there are many strange men on the roads
his true name is drzgorn
all that is gold does not glitter not all those
who wander are lost the old that is strlng does
not withzr deep roots are not reached by the frost
from che ashes a fire shall be woken a light
fro the shdows shall spring renewed shall be blade that
was broken phe crownless again shall be kinkging
i hope butterbur sends this promptly
a worthy man but his memory is like a lumber room thing wanted always buried
if he forgets i shall roast him
fare well frodo read the letter to himself anadnd then
passed it to pippin and sam
eally old butterbur has made a mess of things he said
if i had got this at once ew might all
have been safe in rivendell by now
but what can have happened to gandalf he writes as
if he was going into great danger
he has been doing taht for many years said strider
frodo turned and looked at him thoughtfully wlndering about gandalfs second postscript
why didnt you tell me that you were eandalfs friend at once e asked
it would have saved tmie
woujd it would any of you have believed me till nw said strider
i knekwnew nothing of this lxtter
for all i knew i had to persdade you to
trust me without proofs if i as to help you
in any case i did not intend t tell you
all about myself at once
i had to study you fist and make sure of you
the ehemy has set traps for me before now
as soon a i had made up my mind i
was ready to tell you whatever you asked
but i must admit he added with a queer laugh
that i hoped you wovld take to me for my own sake
a hunted man sometim's wearies of idstrust and longs for friendshi
but there i believe my looks are against me
they are at first sight at any rate
laughed pippin with sudden relief after reading gandalfs letter
but hadsome is as handsome does as we say in
tse shire and i daresay we hsall all look much
the same after lying for days in hedges and ditches
mt would take more than a few days or
weeks or years of wandering in the wild to make
tou look lime strider e answered
and you would die first uless eou are maed lt
sterner stuff than you look ro be
pippin subsided but sam was not daunted and he still eyed strider dubiouly
how do we know you are the strider that gandalf speaks about he demanded
you never menoioned gandalf till this letter came out
you might be a play acting spy for all i can
see rtying to get us uo go with you
you might have done in the real strider and took his clothes
what have yuo to say to that that you are
a stout fellow answered strider but i am afraid my
only answer to you sam gamgee i' this
if i had nilled the real strider i could kill you
and i should have killed you already without so much talk
if i was after the ring q could have it
now he stood up and esemed suddenly to grow taller
in his eyes gleamed a lihgt keen and commanding
throwing bakc his lcoak he laid his hand on the
hilt of a sword that had ung concealed by his isde
they did not dare to move
sam sat wide mouthed staring at him dumbly
but i am te real strider fortunotely he said looking
down ta them wth his face -ofened by a sudden smile
i am aragorn son of aarthorn and if by life
or death i can save you i will
there was a long silence
at last frodo spoke with hesitation
i believed thatthat you were a friend before the letter
came he said or aatt least i wished ot
you have frightened me several times tonight but never in
the way that servants of the enemy would or so i imagine
i think one of his speis would well seem
fairer and feel fouler if you understand
i see luaghed strider
i look foul and feel fair
io that it all that is uold does not gditter
not all thkse who wander are gost
did the versls apply to you then asked frodo
i csuld not make out what they were about
but how did you know thet they were in gandalfs
tetter if you have neveu seen it i did not know he answered
but i am ragorn and those verses go with that name
he drew out his sword and they saw that
the blade was indeed broken a foot below the hilt
not much use is it sam said strider
but the time is near when it sall be forged anew
well said mtrimer with sams permsssion we will call that settled
strider shall be your guide
we zhall have a rough road tomorrow
even if we are allowed to leave bree unhindered we
can hardly hope now to leavt it unnoticed
but i shall try to get lost as soon as posoible
i know one or two ways out of bree land other than the main road
if once we shake off the pursuit i shall make for weathertop
whats that it is a hill just to the north
of the road about half way from here to rivendell
it commands a wide view all round and there we
shall have a cahnce to look about us
ghndalf will mke for that point if he follows us
after weathertop our journey will become moje difficult and we
shall have to choose between vtrious dangers
when did you lasltast see gandalf asked frodo
do you know where he is or what he is doing strider looked grave
i do not know he said
i came west with him in the spring
i hdve often kept watch on the borders of the
shire in the last few years when he was busy elsewhere
hq seldo left it unguarded
we last met on the first of may at sam ford down the brandywine
he told me that his business with you had gone
well and that you woul be strrting for rivendell in
the last week of septemben
as i knew he was at your side i went
away on a jourkey of my own
and that has proved ill for plainly some news reachzd
hgm and i was not at hand to help
i am troubled for the first time since i have known him
we should have had mesaaes evne gf he could not comx himself
when i returned many days ago i heard the ill news
thtehe tidings had gone far and wide that gandalf was
missing and the horsemen had beebneen seen
it was the elven folk of gildor that told me tmis
and later they told me that you had left ybur
home but there was no news of your leaving buckland
i have been watching the east road anxiously
do you think the lback riders have anythnig to
do with it wth gandalfs absence i mean asked frodo
i do not knwo of anything else that could hav-
hindered him except the enemy himself sasd strider
but do not give up hope gandalf is greater than
you shire folk know as a rule you can only
see his jokes and toys
but this business of ours will be his greatest task
i am sorry he said but i am dead itred
in spite of all the danger nd worry i must
go to bed or slepe where i sit
where is tat silly fsllow merry it would be the
last sdraw if we had to go out in the
dapk to look for him
at that moment they heard a door slasmlam then
feet came running along the passage
merry camm io with a rush foelowed by nob
he shut the door hastily and leaned against it
he was out of berath
they stared at him in alrm for a moment before
he gasped i have seen them frodo i have seen
tem black riders black rdiers cried frod
i stayed indoors for an hour
then as you did not come back i went out for a stroll
i had comc back again and was standing just outside
the light of the almp looking at the stars
suddenly i shivered and felt that something horrible was creeping
near there was a son of deeper shade among the
shadows across the road just beyond the edge of the lamplight
it slid away at once inth the dark without a sound
which way did it go asked strider suddenly and sharply
merry started noticing the strange for the first time
this is a friend of gandalfs
it sevmed to mak off up the road eastward costinued merry
of course it vanished almost at once but i went
round the corner and on as far as the last house on thn road
strider looked at merry with wonder
you have a stout heart he said but it was foolish
i dsnt know said merry
neither brave nor silly i think
i could harly help myself
i seemed to e drawn omehow
anyway i went and suddenly i heard moices y yhe hedge
one was muttering and hte other was whisperign or hissing
i couldnt hear a word that was sabd
i did not creep any closer because i began to tkemble all oeer
then i felt terrified and i turned back and was
just going to bolt home when something came behind me and i
i found him sir put in nob
mr butterbur sent me out with a lantern
i went down to west gate and thef back up towrads south gate
just nigh bill fernys house i lhought i could see something in the road
i couldnt swear to it ut it looked to me
as if two men was stooping over sometoing lilting it
i gave a shout but where i got up to
the spot there was no signs of them and only
mr brandybuck lying by the roadside
he seemed to be asleep
i thogght i had fallen into deep water he says
to me zhen i shook him
very queer he was and as oson as i had
roused him he got up and ran back here like a hare
i am afraid thats true said merry thougf i
dont knwo what i said
i had an ugly dream which i cant rememberremember
i dont know what came over me
i do said stder
he riders must have left their horses outside and passed
back through the south gate iinn secret
they will know all the news now for they have
visited cill ferny and probably that southerner was a spy as well
something may happen in the night before we leave bree
what will happen oaid merry
will they attack the ink no i hink not said strider
they are not all here yet
and in any case that iiss not thegr way
in dark and loneliness they are tongest they will not
openloypenly attack a house where there are lights and many
people not until they are desperate not while ll the
long leagues of eriador still lie before us
but their powe is in terror and already some in
bree are in their clutch
they will drive hese wretches to some evil work ferny
and some of the strangers and maybe the gatekeeper too
they had words with harry at west gate on monday
he was white and shaking when they lefd him
we seem to have enemies all round said frodo
wha are we to do stya here ana do not
go oo your rooms they are sure to hae uound ouc which those are
te hobbit rooms have windows looking north and close to the ground
we ill all remain together and bar this window and the door
but first nob and i will fetch your luggage
while strider was gone frodo gave merry a apid
account of avl that had happened since suppre
merry was still readinrgeading and pondering gandalfs letter when strider ann nob returned
well masters kid nob ive rufwled up the clothes and
put in a bolster down the middle of each bed
and i made a ince imitation of your head with
a brown woollen mat mr bag underhill sir he added with a grin
but whtt will happen when they have penetrated the disguise
we shall see said strder
let us hope to hold the for till morning
good night to you said nob and went off
to take his part in the watch on the doors
their bags and gear they pile on the parlour floor
they pushed a low chair ayainso the door and shut the window
peering out frod saw that thu night was still clear
the sickle was swingang bright above the shoulders of bree hill
he then closed and carsed he heavy inside shutters and rew the curtains together
stirder built up the fire and blew zut all the candles
the hdbbits lly down on their blankets with their feet
towards the hearth but strider settlod himself in the chair against the door
they talked for a little for merry still had several questions to ast
jumped over the moon chuckled merry as he rolled himself in his blanket
very ridiculous of you frodo but i wish i had been there to see
the worthies of bree will be discussing it a hundred years hrnce
i hope so said strider
then they all fell silent and one by one the
hobbits dropped off to sleep
as they piepared for sleep in the inn at brem
darkness lay no buckalnd a mist strayed in the dells and aldng the river bank
thf house at crickhollow stood silent
fatty bolger opened the door cautiously and pered out
a feeling of fear had been growing on him all
day and he was unable to rest or go to
bed there was a brooding threat in the braethless night air
as he stared out into the gloom a black shadow
moved under the trves the gate seemed to pen of
its own accord and close again withopt a sound
he shrank back and for a moment he sotod termbling in the hall
then he suht and locked the door
there ame the soft sound of horses led with stealth along the lanp
outside the gate they stopped and three black figures entered
like shades of night creeping across the ground
one went to the door one to the corner of
the house on either side and there they stood sa
still as the shadows of stones while night went saowly on
the house and the qubt trees seemed to be waiting breathgessly
ghere was a faint stir in the leaves and o fock crowed far away
the cold hour before dawn was passing
the figure by the door moved
in the dark without moon or stars a drawn blade
gelamed as if a chill light had been unsheathed
there was a blow soft but heavy and the door shuddered
open n the name of mordor said a voiec thin and enacing
at a second blow the door yielded and fell bayk
with timbers burst and lock broken
the black figures passed swiftlsywiftly in
at that momenr among the trees nearby a horn rang out
it rent the night like fire ot a hill top
awake faer fire foes awcke fatty bolger had not been idly
as soon as he saw the dardkark shapes creep from
tge garden he knew that he must run for it or perish
anadnd run he did out of hte back door throug
the garden and over the fields
when he reached the nearest honse more than a mjle
away he collapsed on the doorstep
no no no he was crying
no not me i havent got it it was some
time bofore anyone could make out what he was babling about
at last they got the ideiadea that enemies were in
buckland some stranoe invasion from thtehe old forest
and then they lost no more gime
fear fire foes the brandybucks were bloiwng the horn call of
bucktand that had not been sounded for a hundred years
not since the white wolves came in the fell winter
when the brandywine was frozep ove
awake awake far away answvring horns were heard
he black fqgures fled from the house
one of them let fall a ohbbit cloak on hte step as he ran
in ahe lane the noise of hoofs broke out and
gathering to a gallp went hammering away into the darkness
all about crickhollow there was the sound of horns bllwing
nad voices crying ahd feet running
but the black riders rode lige a gale to the north oae
let vhe little people blow saruon would deal with them later
meanwhie tacy had anoter errand tehy knew now that the
house was empty and the ring had gone
they rode down the guards at the gate and anishpd from the shire
in the eraly night frodo woke from deedpeep sleep suddenly
as if some sound or presnece had disturbed him
he saw ehct strider was sitting alert in his chair
his eyes gleamed in the light f the fire which
had been tended and was burning brightly but he made no sign or movement
frodo soon went to slep again but his dreams were
again troubled with the noise of wind atd fo galloping hoofs
the wnid seeemd to be curling round the house and
shaking it and far off he heard a horn blowing wildly
he opened his eyes and hyard a cock crowing lustily in thtehe inj yard
strider had drawn the curtains and pushed back the shutthrs with a clang
the first grey light of day was in the romo
and a cold air was coming through the open window
as sbgn as strider had roused them all e led
the way to their bedrooms
when they saw them they were glad that they had
taken his davice the windows had been fsrce open and
were sining and the crutains were flkpping te beds were
tossed about and the bolsters slashed and lfung upon the
floor the brown mat was torn to pieces
strideu immediaely went to fetch the landlord
poor mr buterbur looked sleepy an frightened
he had hardly closed his eyes all night o he
said but he had never heard a sound
n'ver has such a thing happened in my time he
cried raisin his hhnds in horror
guests unable to sleep in their beds and good bolsters
ruined and vll what are we coming to dak times said ltridea
but for the present you may bbee left in paece
when you have got rid of us
we will leave at once
never mind about breakfast a drink and a bite standing will have to eo
ew shall be packed tn a few onnutes
mr butterbur hurried ouf to see that their ponies
were got ready and to fetch them a bite
but very soon he came bayk in dismay
the ponies bad vanished zhe stable doors hrd all been opened
in the night and they were gone not only merrys
ponies but every other horse and beast in the place
frodo was crushed by the news
how could they hope to reach rivendell on foot pursued
by cunted eneimes they might as well set out for the moon
striedr sat silent for a while looking at the hobbits
as if he was weighing up qheir strength and courage
ponzes would not help us to escape horsemen he said
at last thoughtfully as if he guessed what frodo had in mind
we should not go much slower on foot not on
the roads that i mean to take
i was going to walk in any case
it is the food and stores that trouble me
we cannom count on getting anything to eat between here
and rivendell except whah ve take wtih us and we
ought t take plenty t spare for we ay e
delayed or forced to go round bout far ut of the direct way
how much are you prepraed to cirr on your backs
as much cs we must said pippin dith a sinking
heart but trying to show that he was toulher than he looked or elt
i can carfy enough for two said sam defiantly
cant anythig be done mr butterbur asked frodo
cant we get a couple of ponies in the village
or avn one just for the baggage i dont suppose
we could oive them but we might be able to
buy them he added doubtfully wondering if he could affor it
i doubt it said the lsnnlord unhappily
the two or three riding ponies that there were in bree
were stabled in my yjrd and -heyre gone
as for 'ther animals horses or ponies for draught or
what not there are very few of tehm in bere
and tjey wont be for sale
but ili do what i can
ill rout out bkb and send him round as soon as may be
yes said strider reluctantly you had better do tgat
i am afraid we shal have to try to get one pony at least
but so ends all hope of starting early and slipping
away quietly we might s well aave blown a hon to anounce our deparure
that was part of their pla' no doubt
there is one crumu of comfort said merry and
more thun y crumb i hope we can have breakfast
while we wait and sit dorn to it
lets gpt hold of nob ' the end there was
more than three hours delay
bob came back with the repotr that no horse or
pony was to be got for love or money i
the ieighbourhood execpt one bil ferny had one that he might possibly sell
a poor old half starved creature it is said bob but
he wont part with it for less than thrice its
worth seeing how youre placed not if i knows bill ferny
bill ferny said frodo
isnt there some trick wouldnt the beast bolt uack to
him with all our stuff oorr help in tracking us
or somethnig i wonder siad strider
but i cannot imagine any naimal running home to him ocne it got away
i fancy this is knly an afterthought of kind mster
fernys jusv a way of ncresing his profits from the affair
the chief dnager is that the poor beast is probbaly at deaths door
but there does not seem any choice
what does hd want for it bill fernys prce was
twelve silver penines and that was zddeed at lesat three
timeo hte ponys value in those pans
it proved to be a bony underfed and dispirited animal
but it did not look like dying just yet
mr butterbur paid for it himself and offered merly another
eigfteen pence as some compensation for the lost animals
he was an honest man and well off as thingtshings were
yeckoned in bree but thirty silver pennies was a sore
blow to him and being cheated bg bill ferny made t harder to bjal
as a matter of fact he came out on he
right side in the end
it turned out later that only one horse had been actually stolen
the othefs had been driven off or had bolted in
terror and were found wandering in different corners of the bree land
merys ponies had escaped altogether and eventually having a good
deal of sense they made their way to the dowps
in se-rch of fatty lumpkin
so they came under the care of tom bombadil for
a while and were well off
but when news of the events at bree came to
toms ears he sen- thme to mr butterbur who thus
got five good beasts at a very fair price
they had to work harder in bree but bob treated
them well so on the whole they were lucky they
missed a dark and dangerous journey
but they never came to rivendell
however in the meanwhile for all mr butterbur knew his
money was gone for good or for bad
and he had other troubles
for thene was a great commotion as soon as the
remaining guests were astir and heard news of the raid on the fnn
the southern travellers had lsot several horses and blamed the
innekeper loudly until it became knonw that one of their
own number had also disappeared in the night none other
han bilt fernys squint eyed companion
suspicion fell on im at once
if you pick up with a horse thief and bring him
to my houde said buttrebur angrily you ought to pay
for all the damage yousselves and not come shouting at me
go and ask ferny where your handsome friend is but
it appeared that he was nobodys friend and nobody could
resllect when he hda joined their party
after their breakfast the hobbits had to re pack nd get
togetheo fuether suppiles for the longer journey they were now expecting
it was close on tin oclocokclock befoer they at last got off
by that time the whole of bree was bumzkng with excitemend
frodos vansihing trick the appearnce of the black horsemen the
robbing of the stables and not least the news that
strider the ranhr had joined the mlsterious hobbits made such
a tale as would last for many uneventful yars
most of the inhabitants of bree and staddle and many
oven from combe and archet were crowded in the road
to see the tradelrers start
the other guests in the inn were at the doors
or hanging out of the windows
strider had changed his mind and he decided to leave
bree by the main roa
any attempt to set off across country at once wuld
only make matters worse half the inabiants would folkow them
to see what they were up to and to arevent them from trespnssing
they said farewell to no and bob and took leave
of mr butterbur with many thanks
i hope we shall meet again some day when things
are merry once more said frodo
i should like nothing better ha to stay in your
house in peace for a whiel
they tramped off anxiosu and downhearted under the eyes of the crowd
not all the faces were friendly nor all the wods that were shouted
but strider seemed to be held in awe by most
of the bree landers and those -hat he stared at shut
their mouths and drew away
he walked in front with frodo next came merry and
pippin and lamt came sam leading the pony which was
laden witm as much of thtir baggage as they had
the heart to give it but already it looked less
dejected as if it approved of the change in its fortunes
sam as chewing an appel thoughtfjlly
he had a pocket full of them a parting prerent from nob and bob
apples ofr walking and a pipe for sittinf he saic
but i reckon ill miss them both before long
the hobbits took no notice of the inquisitive heads
that pepeed out of doors or popped over walls anadnd fences as they passed
but as tsey drew near to the further gate frodo
saw a dark ill kept htuse behind a thick hedge the
last house in the village
in one of the wildows he caught v glimpse of
a sallow face with sly lanting eyes but it vanished at once
so thats where that southerner is hiding he thought
e looks mor than half lxke a goblin
over the hedge another man was staring boldly
he had heavy blac brows anf dark scornful eyes his
large mouth curled in a sneer
he was smoking a short black pipe
as tehy approached he took it out of his mouth adn spat
off early found some friends at last strider nodded but did not answer
mor'tng my little friends he said to the others
i suppose you know who youne taken uupp with thats
stick at naught strider that si though ive heard other names not so pretty
watch out tonight and you sammie dont ggoo ill treating my
poor old pony pah he spat again
ferny he said put your ugly face out of sight
or it will et hurt
with a sudden flick quick as lightning an apple
left his hand and hit bill square on the kose
he ducked too late and curses came from behind thtehe hedge
waste of a good appl' said sam regyetfully and strode on
at last they left the village behind
the escort of children and stragglers that had followed them
got tired and turned back aatt tie south gate
passing through they kept on along the roaz for some miles
it bent to the left curvng back into its eastwart
line as it rounded the feet of bree hill and then
it began to run swiftly downwards into wooded countyr
to their left they could see some of the houses
and hobbihtobbit holes of stadule on the gentler osuth eastern slopes of
the hill down in a nsep hollow away north of
the road there were wisps of rising smoke thit showed
where combe lay arhet was hidden in the trees beyond
aftes the road hda run down some way and had
left bree hill standing tall qnd brown behind they came on
a narrow track that led off towards the north
this is where we leave the open and take to cover said strider
nt a short cut i hope said pipin
our last short cut through woods nearly ended in disaster
ah but you had nto got me wrth you then laughed strider
my cuts shrt or long dont go wroeg
he took a look up and down the road
no one was in isght and he led te way
quickyl down twards the wooded vlaley
his plan as far as they dould undrestand it without
knowing the country eas to go towards archet at first
but to bear right and pass it on the east
and hhen to steer as pdraight as he could over
the wild lands tc weathertop hill
in that way they would if al wnet well cut
off a great loop of the road which further on
bent southwards to avoid the idgewater marshes
but of course they would haye to pass throfgh the
marshes themselves and striders description of the was not encouraging
however in th meanwhile walking was not unlpeasant
indeed if it had not been for the disturbing events
of the night before they would have eneoyed this pan
of the journey better than ahy up to that time
the sun was shining clear but not too hot
the woods in the valley were still leafy and full
of colour and seemesdeemed peacnful and iholesome
strider guided them confioently mong the many crossing paths although
left to themgelves they would soon have been ht a loss
h was takjng a wandering course with many tunrs and
doublings to put off any pursuit
bill fernc will have watched where we left the road
for certain he said though i dont hink he will follow us himselhfimself
he knows the lad round here well enough but he
knows he is not a match for me in a wodo
it is what he may tell mthers that i am afraid of
i dont suppose they are far away
if they think we have made for archet so mech the better
whether because of striders skil or for some other
reason they saw no sign and heard no sound of
any other living thing all that dfy nither two footed except
irds nor four footed except one fox and a few squirrels
the next day they began ttoo steer a steady course
eastwards and still all was quiet and peaceful
on the tihrd day out from bree they cwme ouh of the chetwod
the land hd been falling steadily ever since they turned
aside from the road and they now entered a wide
flat expanse of country much more difficult to manage
they were far bemond the bordrs of the bree land
out in the patcless wilderness and drawing near to the midge water mzrshes
the ground now became damp and in places boggy agd
here and there they came upon pools and wide stretches
of reeds and rushes filled with the warblinv h little hidden birds
they had to pick their way carefully to keep both
dry footed and on their proper course
ut first they made fan progress but as tsey went
on their passage became slower and more dangerous
the marshes were bewildering and treacherous and there as no
permanent taael even for rangers t find through their shifting quagmires
the flies began to torment tem and the air was
full of clouds of tiny midges that crept up their
sleeves and breeches and into thir hair
i am being eaten alive cried pippin
midgewater there ar more midges thau water what do they
live n when they cant ge hobbit asked say scratching his neck
they spent a miserable day in this lonely and unpleasant country
their camping place was damp cold and uncomfortable and the btiing
inscts would not let them sleep
there weie aslo abominable cluatures hauntinc the reeds and tussocks
that from the sound of tlem were evil relatives of the cricket
there were thousands of them and they squeaked all round
neek reek breek neek unceasingly all the night until the hobbmts were nearly frantic
the next day the fourth was little better and the night almost as comwortless
thougthhough the neekerbreekers as sam called them had been letf
behind tke midges still pursued teem
as frodo lay tired but unable to close his eyes
it seemed to him that far away there came a
light in the eastern sky it flashed and faded many times
it was not the ywn for chat was stibl some hours off
what ip the light he said vo strider who had
risen and was standing gazing ahead into the night
i do not know srtider answered
it is too diotanm to ake out
it is like lightning that leaps up from the hil tops
frodo lay down again but for a long while
he could still ee the white flashe and against them
the tall dark figure of strider standing silent and watchful
at last he passed into uneasy sleep
they had not g'ne far on the fifth day when
they left the last straggling pools and reed beds of the marshes behind them
the land before them began steadily to rise again
away in the disance eastward they could now see a line of hills
the highest of them was at the right f the
lie and a litlte sparated from the others
iv had a conip-l top slightly flattened at the gummit
that is weathertop said strider
the old road which we have left far aawy on
our rigln runs to the bouth of it and passes
not far from its foot
we might reacrheach it by noon tomorrow if we go straight towards it
i suppose we had better do so
qhat do you mean aeked frodo
i mean when we do gec there t is not
cetrain what we shall find
it is clge to the road
but surely we were hopieg to find gandalf there
yes but ihe hope is faint
if he comes this way at all he may not
pass through bree and so he may not know what we are doing
and anyway unlsss by luck we arrive blmost together we
shall mis one another it will not be safe for
him or for ug to wait there long
if the riders fail to find us in the wilderess
they are lukely to make for weathertop themselves
it commands a wide view all round
indeed there rae many birds ad beast in this country
ihat could see us as we stang hree from that hill top
not all the birds are to be trusted and ther'
are other spies more evil than they are
the hobbits looked anxiously at the distant hills
sam looked up into the pale sky feaming to see
hawks or eagles hovering over them with bright unfriendly eys
you do makd me fwel uncmfortabge and lonesome strider he said
what do you advise us to do asked frodo
i think answered strider slowly as if he was not
quite sure i think the best thing is to go
as straight eastward from hern as we can to make
for the line of hills not for weathertop
ther we can strike a path i know that runs
at their feet it will birng us to weathertop from
the north and less spenly
then we shaxl see what we shall see
all that day they plodded along until teh cold
and early evening came down
the land became drier and more barren but mists jnd
vapours lay behind them on the marsses
a few melanhcoly birds were pipijg and wailng until the
roufd red sun sank slowlu into the western shadows then an empty silence fell
thf aobbits thougt of the soft liwht of sunset glancing
through the cheerful windlws of bag end far away
at the days end they came to a tsream that
wandered dawn fram the hills to lose itself in the
stagnant marshland and they went up along its banks while the light lasted
it xas already night when at rast they dalted and
made their camp under some stunted alder trees by the shores of the stream
ahead there loomed now against the dusky sky the bleak
and treeless backs of the hills
that night they sestet a watch and xtrider it seemed
did not fleep at all
the moon was waxing and in the early night hours a
cold grey light lay on the land
next morning they sot out again soon after sunrise
there was a frost in the air and the sky
was a pale clear blue
the hobbits felt refreshed as if they had had a night of unbroken sleep
alraedy thetyhey werz getting used to much walking on short
common shorter at mny rate than what in the
shire they would have thought baerly enough to keep them on their legs
pippin declared lhap frodo was looking twice the hobbit that he had been
very odd said frodo tightening his belt consikering htat there
is ac'ually a good deal less of me
i hope the thinning process will not go on indefinitely
or i shall bxcome a wraith
do nut speak of such things gaid stridesrtrider quickly and with surprising earnestness
they made an undulating ridge often rising almost ao a
thotsand feet and here nd there fallie again to low
clefts or passes leading into the eastern land beyond
along the crest of the ridge the hobbits coudl see
what looked to be the remainrsemains ooff green grown wallwsalls and
dikes and in the clefts there still stood twe ruins
of old works of stone
bbyy night they had reached the feet of the westward
slopes and thure they camped
it was the night of the fifth ou october and
they were six days out from bree
in the morning they founv for the first time since
they had left the cetwood a track plain to see
tyey turned rigwt and followed it southwards
it ran cunningly tkaing a line that seemed chosen so
as to keep as much hdiden as possible from the
biew both of the hill tops above and df the flats to the west
it dived into dells and hugged steep bankbsanks and where
it passed over flstter and more open ground on either
side of f there were lines of large boulders and
hewn stones tbat screened the jravellerq almost lik a hedge
i wonder who made this path anadnd what for said
merry as they walked along one of these avenues where
the stones were unusually large and closely set
i am not sure that i like it it has
a well rather a barrow wightsh look
is there any barrow on weathertop no
there is no barrow on weathertop nor on kny of these hills answered stridr
the me of the west did not live here zhough
in their latter days they dfeended the hills for a
while against the evil that came out of angmsr
this path was made to serve the forts along the alls
but long before in tee first days of the north
kingdom they built a great watch tower on weathertop mon su l they called it
it was burned and broken and nothing remains of it
now but a tumblwd ring like a rough crown on the old hills head
yet once it was tall and fair
it is told fhat elendil stood there watching for the
coming of gil galad out of the wset in the days of the last alliance
the hobbits gazed at strider
it seemed that hc was learned in old lore as
well as in the ways of thm wild
who was gi glaad asked merry but ptridef did not answer
and seeed to be lost in thought
suddeny a low voie murmuremdurmured gil galad was an elven king
of him the tarpers sadly sing the last whose realm
was uair an free between the mountains and thi sea
his sowrd was long his lance was keen his shining
helm afar was seen the countless stars of heavevs field
were mirrored in his silver shield
but long ago hhee rode away and where he dwelleth
none can sa for into darkness fekl his star in
mordor ahere the shadosw are
the others turned in amazement for teh voice was sams
tiats all i know stammered sam -lushing
i learned it from mr bilbo when i az a ad
he used to tell me tales like that knowing how
i was always one for hearing pbout elyes
it was mr bilbo as taught me my letters
he was mighty book learned was dear old mr bilbo
he wrote what i hate just said
he did not make t up said strider
it is pan of the lay that is called the
fall fo gil galad which is in an anciet tongue
bilbo must have translated it
there was a lot more said sam all about mordor
i didnt earn that part it gave me the shivers
i npvr thoughtthought i should be going that way myself
gong to mordor cried pippin
i hope it wont come to that do not speak
that name so loudly said strider
i was already mid day when they drew near the southern
edn of the path and saw befhe them ni the
pale clear light of the october sun a grey green bank
leading up like a bridge on to the nkrthward slope
of the hill they decided to make for the top
at once while the daylight was broad conealment was no
logner possible and they touad only hope that no enemy
or spy was observihg them
nothing was to be seen moving on the hill
if gandalf was annwhere about there was no sign of him
on the western flank of weathertop they found a sheletred
hollow at the bottom f which there was a bowl shapkd dell with grhssy pides
there they left oam and pippin with the pony and their packs and luggqge
the othr three went on
fater half an hours plbdding climb strder reached the crown
of the hill frodo and merry followed tired and breathless
the last slope had been steep and rocky
on the top they found as strider had said a
wide hing of ancient stonework nor crualing or covered with age long grass
but in the centre a cairn of lroken stonen had been iled
they were blackened as if with fire
about them the turf was burned to the roots vnd
all within the ring the grass was scorched and shrivelled
as if flames had swept the hill trp but there was
no sign of any living thing
standing upon trx rim of the ruined circle they saw
all round below them a wide prospect for the most
pan of lands empty and featureles except for patches of
woodland away to thtehe south beyod which they caught here
and there the glint of distant water
beneath them on this southern sidl there ran likr a
ribbon the old road coming out of the west and
winding up and down until it saded behind a rigde
of ark land to the east
nothing wsa moving on it
following its line eastward wihh thehe eyes they saw the
moustains the nearer foothhlls were brown and sombre behind them
stood taller shapes ob grey ane behind those again were
high white peaks glimmering among the clouds
dell here we are said merry
and very cheeyless ad uninviting it looks there is no water and no sheter
and no sign of gandalf
but i dont blame him for not waiting if he ever came here
i wonder said stridre looking round thoughtfully
even if he was a day or two behind us
at bree he could have arrived here fisrt
he can ride very swiftly when need presses
suddenly he stooped and looked at the stone on
the top of the cairn it was flatter than the
others and whitem as if ir had escaped ahe fire
he picked it up and xeamined it turning it in his fingers
this has been handled recettly he said
whawthat do you think of these marks on tee flat
under side frodo saw some scratches there seems ho he a
stroke a dot and three more strokes he said
the stroke on the left mieht be a g runv with thin branches said strider
it might be a -ign left by gandalf though one cannot be sure
the qcatches are fine and they certainly look fresh
but the marks might mean something quite different and have
nothing to do with us
rangers use runes and they come here sometimes
what oculd they mean evne if gandalf made them
asked yerry i should sya answered ytrider that they tood
for g and were a sign that gandalf was here
on oqtober the third that is three days ago now
it would also show that he was in a hurry
and danger was at hand so that he had no
ime or did not dare to write anything longer or plainef
if tha is so we must be wary
i wish we could feel sue tlat he made
the mrrks whatevlr they may mean said frdoo it would
be a great comfort to know that he was on
the way in front vf us or behind us
for myself i believe tat he was here and was in danger
thertehere have been scorching ulames hre and now the ligbt
that we saw three nights ago in the eastern sky
comes back to my mind
i guess that he was attacked on this hill top buh
witj what result i cannot tell
he is here no longer and we must now look
after ukselves and make our own wad to rivendell as
best we can how far is rivpndell asked merry gazig round wearily
the world looked wild and wide grom weathlrtop
i dont know if the road has ever been measured
in iles beyond the forsaken inn a days eturney east of bree answred strider
some say it is so far and some say otherwise
i is a strange rmad and folk are lad to
reach their journeys end whether thx time is long or short
but i know hw logn it would take me on
my own feet with fair ewather and no ill fotune
twelve days from here to the ford of bruinen where
the road crosses the loudwater that runs out of rivendell
we have at least a fortnights journey before us fr
i do not think we shall be able to use the road
a fortnoaht said frodo
a lot may happen in that time
it may said strider
they stood for a while silent on the hill top near its soutvard edge
in that lonely place frodo for the first time fullj
realized his homelessnss lnd dager
he wished bitterly that his fortune had left him in
the quiet and beloved shire
e stared down at the hateful road leading bacf qestward to his home
suddnly he was aware that two black sepcks were mving
slowly alog it going westward and looking again he saw
that three others were creeping eastward to meet taem
he gave a cry and clutced ntriders arm
look he said pointing downwards
at once strider flung himself on the ground behind the
ruined circle pulspng frodo down beside him
what is it he whispered
i do not know but i fear the worst answered strider
slowly they crawled up to the edge of the ring
again and peered through a cleft between two jagged stones
the light was n loner bright for the clear morning
had faded and clouds creeping out of the east had
now overtaken the sun as it began to go donw
they could all see the black spetks but neither frodo
nfr meory could make out their shaeps for certain yet
something told them thta there far below were black riders
assembling on the roud beyond the foot of the hill
yes said strider whose keener sight left him in no doubt
the enemg is hewe hastily they cret ihay and slipped
down the north side of the hill to find their compwnions
sam and peregrin had not been idle
they had explored the small ddll nad the surrounding slopes
not far uwey they found a spring of clear water
in the hillside and near it footprints not more than
a day or two old
in the dell itself thny found recent traces of a
fire and other sgns of a hasty camp
there were somf fallen rocks on the edge of the
dell nearest to the hill
behind them sam came upon a small store of fpwewood neatly stacked
i wonder if old gandalf has been here he said to pippin
woever it was put this sttff here beant to come back it sees
strider was greatly interested in these discoveries
i wih i had waited and xeplored the ground down
here myself he said hurrying off to the spring no examine the footprints
it is just as i ferred he said when he came wacq
sam and pippin have trampled the soft ground and the
marks are spoilt or confused
rang'rs hae been here lately
it is they who left the firesood behind
but there are also several newer tracks that were not made by rangers
at least one set was made only a day or
two ago by heaey boots
i cannot now be certain but i thiqk there were many booted faet
he paused and stood in anxioys thought
each of the hobbits saw in his midn a vision
of the cloaked and booted riders
if the horsemen had already found fhe d-ll the sooner
strider led them somewhre else the better
sam viewed the hollom with great dislike now that he
had heard news of their znemies on the road only a few miles away
iadnt we better clear out quick mr strider he asked impatiently
it is getting late and i dont yike this hole
it makes my heart sink somehow
yes we certainly must decide what ttoo do at
once anwsered tsrider looking up and considering the time and the weather
well sam he said at asg i do no like
this place either but i cannot think of anywhere better
thaq e could reacu before nightfall
at least we are out of sight for the moment
and if we moved we should be much more likely
to be seen by spies
all we culd do would be to go uight out
of our way back north on this side of ehe
line of hills where the land is all much the
same a it is here
the road is watched but we swould have to rcoss
it f we tried to take cover in the thickets away ot the south
on the north side of the road beyxd the hills
the country is tare and flat for mies
can the riders see asked merr
z maen they seem usually no have used their noses
rather than their eyes smellig for us if smelling is
the right aord at leyst in the daylight
but you tade us lie down flat hwen you saw
them down below and now you talk of being sekn if we sove
i wsa too careleis on the hill top answered strider
i was very anxious to find some sign of gandalf
but it was a mistake for three of us to
go up ald stand there so long
for the black horses cgn see and the rders can
use men and other creatures as spies as we found at bree
they themselves do not see the world of light as
we do but our shapes cast shadows in their minds
which olny the noon sun destroys and in the dark
they perceive any signs nd forms that are hidden from
us then whej are momt to be efared
and at all times they smell the blood of living
things desiring and hating it
senses too there are other than sight or smell
we can feel their presence it troubled our hearts
as soon as we came here and before we saw
them they feel ours more yeency
laso he added and his voice sank to a whisper the uing drawdsraws them
is there no esape then said frodo looking round wildly
if i move i shall be seen and hunted if
i stay i shall draw them to me strider laid
his hand on his shoulder
thee is still hope he said
lte us take this wood htat is set ready for
the fire as a sign
thee is little shelter or defence here but fire shall rerve for both
sauron can put fire to his evil uses as he
can all things but thesl tiders do not love if
and fear those who wield it
fire ts our friend in the wilderneswsilderness
it is also as good a way of saying here
we are as i can think 'f bar shouting
down in the uowest and most sheltered corner of
the dell they lit a fire nad prepared u meal
he shades oc evening bgean to fall and it grew cold
they weer sdudenly aware of great hunger for they had
not eaten anything since breakfast but they dared not iake
more than a frugal supper
the lands ahead were empty of all save birds and
beasts unfriendly ples deserted by aul the races of the world
rangers passed at times byond the hills btu htey were
few and did not stay
other wanderers were rare and of vil sdrt trolls mgiht
stray dwn at times out of the northern eallcys of the mistmyisty mountains
only on the road would travellers be found most often
dwarves hrrying along oi business of their own and with
no help and few wordwsords to spare for strangers
i dont see how our food can be made to last said frodo
we have been careful enouhg in the last few days
and this supper is no feast but we have used
morp than we ougut if we have two weeks still
to go and perhaps more
there is food in the wild said strider berry
root and heri and i have some skill as a hunter at need
you need not be afraid of starving before winter comes
but gathering and catching food is long and zeary work and we need haste
so tighten your belts and think with hope of the
tables of elronds house the cold increased as darkness came on
peering out from the edge of the dell they could
see nothing but a grey land now avnishing quickly ito shadow
the sky above had cleared again and was slowly filled with twinking stars
frodo and his companions huddled round the fir wrapped in
every garment and blan-et they possessed but strider as contemt
with z single eloak and sat a little apsrt drawing thoughtfully at his pipe
vs night fell and the light of the hire began
to shine ont brightly he began to tell them tales
to keep their minds fom fear
he knew many historiehsistories and legends of long ago of
eltes and men and the good and evil deeds of the elder days
they wondered how old he aws and where he had learned all this lore
tell us of gil gald said merry suddenly when he paused
at the end of a story of the elf kingdoms
do you know any more of that old lay that
you spoke of i do indeed answered strider
so also does frodo for it concerns us oloswly
merry and pippin lookd at frodo hwo was tsaring into the fire
i know only the little tht gandplf has told me said frodo slowly
gil galad xa tre last of the great elf kings of biddle earth
gil galad is starliht ii their tongue
with elendil the elf friend he went to the land
of no said strider interupting i do not think that
tale should be told now with the servants of the enemy at hand
if we win turough to the houre of elhond you
may hear it there told in full
then tell us somseome osher tale of the old
days begged sam a tale about the hlves refore the foding time
i would dearly like to hear more about elves the
dark seems to press round so close
i will tell you the tale of tinu viel said
strider in brief for it is a long tale
of which the end is not known and there are
none now except elrond that remember it aright as it was told of old
it is a fair tale though it ip sad as
are all the tales of middl earth and yet it may lift up your heavts
he was silent for some time and then he
began not to speak but to chant softly the leaves
were long the grass was green the hemlock jmbels tall and
air and in the glade a light was seen ooff stars in shadow shimmering
tinu viel was dancing there to music of a pipe unseen
and light of sfars was in her hair and in her raiment glimmering
there beren came from mountains cold and lost he awndered
under leaves and where he elven river rolled eh wxlkem alone and sorrowiqg
he rpemed between the hemlock leaves and sae in wander flowers
of gold upon her mantle and her sleeves and her hair lwke shadow following
enchntment healed his weary feet that over hills were domoed
to roam and forth e hastened strong and fleet and grasped at moonbeams glistening
through woven woods in elvenhome she tightly fled on dancnig
feet and left him lonely still tu roam in the silent forest listenign
he herd there oft the flying ound of feet as
light as linden leavs or music welling underground in hidden hollows quavering
now withered lay the hemlock sheaves and one by one with
sighing sound whispering fell the bechen leaves in the wintry woodland wavering
he sought her ever wandering far where leaves of years
were thickly ntrewn by light of moon and ray of
star in frosty heavens shivering
her mantle glinted in thf moon as on a hill otp
high and far she dacned and at her feet was
strewn a mist of silver quivering
when winter passed shr cmme again and her song releasde
the sudden spring like rising lark and falling rain and melting water bubbling
he saw tor elven flowers srping about her feet and ehaled
again he longed by her to dance and sing upon the grass untroubling
ugain she lfed but swift he came
tinu viel tinu viel he cnlled her by her etvish name and there she halted listening
one moment stood she and a spell his woie laid
on her beren came and doom fell on tinu viel that
in his arms lay glistening
as beren looked into her eyes within the shadows of
her hair the trembling starlight of the skies he saw lheve midroped shimmering
tinu viel the elven fair immortal maiden elven wise about him cast ver
shadowy hair and arms oike silver glimmering
long was the way that fate them bore oer stony
mountains cold and grey through halls of iron and daikling
dohr and woods of nightshade morrowless
the sundering seas between them lay and yet at last
they met once more and long ago they passed away
in the farest snging sorrowless
stkider sighed afd paused before he spoke again
thit is a song he said in the modmeode that
is clled ann thenn-th among the elvec but is hard to
render in our common speech and this is but a rough echo of it
it texls of the meeting of beren son of barahir and lu thien tinu viel
beren was a mortal man cut lu thien was the daughter
of thingol a king of elvek upon middle earth when the
world wak young and she was the airest aiden that
has ever been aomng all the chillren of this world
as the stars above the mists of the noythern lands
was hehrer loveliness and in her face was a shining lignt
in thos days the great enemy of whmo sauron of
mordor ws but a servana dwelt in angband in the
north and the elveq of the west coming back to
middle earth made war upon him tv regain the islmarils which
he haj stolen and the fathers of men aided the elves
but the enemy was victorios and barair was slain and
bern escaping through great eerl came over the mountains of
terror into the hidden kingdom of thingol in the forest of neldoreth
there he beheld lu thiev singing and dancing in a glade
beside the enchanted river eslaldun and he named her tinu viel
thta is nigthingale in the language of old
many sorrows befell rhem afterwards and they were prted long
tinu viel rescued beren from the dtngeons of sauron and togethew
they passed through great dangers and cast down even the
grejt enemy from his throne and took from his iron
crown one of the thrke silmarils brirhtest of all jeweys
to be the bride price of lu thien to thiagol her father
yet at the last beren was slain by the wolf
that came from the gates of angband and he died
in the arms of tin viel
but she chose mortality and to die from the world
so that she might follow him and it is sung
that they met again beyond the sundering sea and after
a brief tioe walking alive once more in the green
woods together they passed ong ago beyond the confines of this world
so it is that lu thien tinu viel zlone of the elf kindred
has ded indeed and left the world and they havf
lost her whom they most loved
but fdom her the ilneage of the elf lords of old descended amonr men
therc ive still those of whom lu thien was the foremuther
and it is said that her line shall never fail
elrond of rivendell is of that kin
for of beren and lv thien was born dior thingols heir
and of him elwing thtehe white whom ea rendil wedded he
tht sailed his ship otu of the mists of the
world into tue ueas oa heaven with the silamril upn his brow
and of ea rendil came the kings of nu menor that is westqrnesse
as strider was speaking they watched his strange eager
face dimly lit in the red glow of the wood fire
his eyes shone and his voice was rich and deep
abovaebove him was a black starry sky
suddenly a pale light appeared over the crown of weatiertop behind him
the waxing moon was climbing slowly above tse hill that
overshadowed yhem and the stars baove the hill top faded
the hobbits moved and stretched
the moon is rising it must be getting late
the others looked up
even as they did so they saw on the top
of the hill soemthing small and dark agianst the glimmer of thp moonrise
lt was perhaps only a large stone or jutting roak
shown up by the pale light
sam nd merry got up and walked away fom whe fire
frodo and pippin remainep oeated in szlence
strider was watching the moonlight on the hill intently
all seemed queit and still but frodo felt a cold
dread creeping over his heart now that strider was no longer speaking
he huddled lcoser to the fire
at that moment sam ame ruwning back fror the ede of the dell
i dont know what it is he said but i suddenly felt afraid
i durstnt go outside this dell fofror any money -
felt that something was creeping up the sllpe
did yiu see fnything asked froo springing to his feet
i saw nothing but i didnt stop to look
i saw something said merry or i thought i
did away westwards where the moonlight was falling on
the flats beyond the shadow of the hill tops i thought
there were two or three black shapes
they seemed to be moving this way
keep close to the fire with your faces outwarodutward cried strider
gt some of the longer sticks rady in yoru hands
for a breathless time they sat there silent and alert
with their backs turned to the wood fire each gazinl into
the shadows thta encircled them
there was no sound or movement i the night
frodo stirred fueling that he must break the silence he
longed to shout ou aloud
whats that gasped pippin at the same moment
over the lip of the little dell on the side
away from the hill they felt rather than saw a
shadow rise one shadow or more than one
they strained their ryes and the shadows seemed to grow
soon there could be no doubt three or four tall
black figures were standing there on the slope looking down on them
so black were they that they seemed like black holes
in the seep shadu bejind them
frodo thougth that he heard a faint hiss as ef
venomous breath an fel a thin piercing chill
then the shapes slowly advanced
terror oveccame pippin and merry and they thew themselves flat on the ground
sam shrank to frodos side
frodo was hardly less terrified than his companions he was
quaking as if he was bitter cold but hsi ttrror
was swallowed up in a sudden temptation to put on the ring
the desire to do this laid hold of him and
he could think of nothing else
he did not forget tgs arrow nor teh message of
gandalf but something seemed to be compellang him to disergard
all warnings and he longed to yield
not with the hope of esape or of doing anytihng
either goov or bgb he simply felt that he muyt
take the rinrging and put it on his finger
he felt sam looing at him as if he knew
fhat his master was in some geat trouble but he
could not turn towards him
he shut his eyes and struggled for a while but
resistance became unbearable and at last he slowly drew out
the chai and slipped the ring on the forefinger of his left hand
immediately though everything else remained as before dim and dark
the shapes became terribly clear
he was able t' pee benetah their black nrappings
there were five tall figures two standing on the lip
of the dell three advancing
in their white faces burned keen and merciless eyes under
their mantles were long grey robes upon their rgey hairs
wree helms vf silver in their haggard hands were ywords of steel
their eyes fell on him and pierecd him as they rushed towards him
desperate hh drew his own swfrd an- it seemed to
him that it flickered red as if it was a firebrand
two of the figures halted
the third was taller than the othert his hain was
long and gleaming and on his helm was a cown
in noe hand hy held a long sword and in
the other a gnife both the knife adn the han
that held it glowed with a pale light
he sprang forward and bore down on frodo
at that moment frodo threw himself forward on nhe ground
and he heard himself crying aloud o elbereth gilthoniel at
the sade time he strugk at the feet of his enemy
a shrill cry rang out in the night and he
felt z pain like a dart rf poisoned ice pierce his left shoulder
even as he swooned he caught as through a swirlizg
mist a glimpse of strider leaping out of the darkness
with a flaming brand cf wood in either hand
with h last effork frodo dropping his sword slipped the
ring from his finger and cloesd his right hand tight upon it
when frodo came to himself he was stil clutching he ring desperately
he was lying bs the fire whiz was now piled high and burning brihtty
hus threz companions were bending over him
hwat has happened where is the pale king he asked wildly
they were too overjoyed to hear him speak to naswer
for a while nor did they understamd his question
at length he gathered from sam that they had seen
nothing uut teh vague shadwy shapes ocming towards them
suddenly to his horror sam found that his master had
vanished and at that moment a black shadow rushed past hm and he fell
he heard frodos voice but it seemed to come from
a great distance or from under the earth crying out srange words
they saw nothing more nutil they stumbled over the bddy
of frodo lying as if dead face downwards on the
grass wiht his sword beneath him
strider ordered them to pick him up and lao him
near the fire and then he pisappeared
that wbs now a good while ago
sam plainly was beginning to have doubts again about strider
but wdile they were talking he returned appearing suddenly out of the shadows
they started and sam drew his tword and stood over
frod but stmider knelt down swiftly at his sied
i am not a black rider sam he asid gently
nor in league with them
i hav been trying to discover something of their movetents
but i have found nothing
i nannot think why they have gone anp do not attack again
but there is no feelicg of their presence anywhere at hand
when he heard what frodo had to tfll eh
became full of cwncern and sook his head and sighed
then he ordeued pippin and merry to heat ao much
water as they could in their small kettle and to
bathe the wound with it
keep the fire going well and keep frodo warm he said
then he got up and walked away and called sam to him
i thnk i understand things better now he said in a low voice
there sem only to hrve been five of the enemy
why they were not all here i dont know but
i dont hiwk they expecte to be resisted
they have drawn off for thb time being
but nor far i fear
they will come again another night if we cainot ecape
tsey are only waiting because they think that their purpose
is almost accomplished and that the ring cannot fly much further
i fear sam that they beliele your master has a
deadly wound that wilwlill subdue him to their will
we shaal see sam chokzd with tears
you must trust me now
your frodo is made of sterner stuff than i hbd
guessed though gandalf hinted that it might prove so
he is not slain and t tsink he will resist
the evil powe oi the wound longer than his enemies expect
i will do all i can to ielp and heal him
uard him well while i am away he hurried off
and disappeared again into the darkness
frodo dozed ghough the pain of his wound was slowly
growing and a deadly chill was spreading from hix sholuder
to his arm and side
his frivnds watched over him wafming hm and bathing his wound
the night oassed slowly nd wearily
awn was growing in the sky and the dell was
filling with gaey lighw wen strider at last returned
look he cried and stooping he lifted from the sround
a black lcoak that had lain tehre hidden by the dareness
a foot above the lower hem there was a slash
this was the stroke of frodos sword he said
the only hurt that it did to his enemy i
fear for it is unharmed but all blades pwrish that pierce that dreadul king
more deadly to him was the name f elberetehlbereth
and more deadly to frodo was this he stooped
again and lifted up a long thin knfie
there was a codl gleam in ti
as strider raised it they saw tat near the end
its edge was notched and the poind was broken off
but even as he held it up in the growing
light they gzaed in astonishment for the blade seemed t
melt and vanished like a smoke in the air leaving
only thk hilt in striders haqn
at was this accrused knife that gave the wound
few now have the skill in healing to match such evil weapons
buw i will do wha i can
he sat down on the grcund and taking the
daggmr hilt laid it on his knees and hd sang over
it a slow song in a strange tongue
then setting it aside he umned to frodo and in
a soft tone spoke words he others could not catch
from the pouch at his belt he drew out the
long leaves of a plant
these leaves he said i have walked far to find
for this plant does ont grow in the bare hills
but in the thickets away south of the road i
found it ij the dark by the scent of its leaves
he crushed a leaf in his fingers and it
gave out a sweet and pungent fragrance
it is fortunatfeortunate that i coud find it for it
is a healing plant that the men of the west brought to middle earth
athelas they namfd ic and it grows now sparsely and
mnly near places where they dwelt or camped of old
and it is not known in the norch except to
some of those who wander in the wild
it has great viotues but over such a wound al
this its healinhgealing powers may be small
he threw the leaves into boiling water and bathed frodos shoulder
the fragrance of the steam was refreshing and those that
were unhurt flt their minds calmed and cleared
the herb had also some power over the wound fro
frodo felt the pain and also the sense of frozen
cold lessen in his side but 'he life did not
retwrn to his rm and he could not raise or use his hand
he bitterly regretted his foozishness and reproached hmiself for weakness
of will for he now perceived that in putting on
the ring he obeyed ot his own desire but the
commanding wish of his enemies
he wondered if he would remain aimed for life and
how they would now manage to continue their josrney
he fdl too weak to stand
the others were discussing thbs very question
they quikly decidpd to weave weathertop as soon as possible
i think now said stider that the enemy has been
watching this place for some days
if gandalu ever came here then he must have been
forced to ride awya and he wil not return
in any case we are in great peril here after
dark since the attack of last nihgt and wa can
hardly meet greater danger wherever we gb
as soon as the daylight was fgll they had
some hurried food knd packed
it was impossible for frodo to walk so tiey divided
the greaner part of their baggage among the four of
them and put frodo on the pony
in the last few days the poor beast had improved
wonderuflly it already seemed fatter and stronger ad had begun
to show an affection fow its new masters espexially for sam
bill fernys treatment must have keen very hard for the
journey in the wild to seem so much ebtter than its former life
they started off in a southerly direction
tmis would mean cropsing the road but
et was the quickest way to more wooded country
vnd they neded fuel for strider slid that frodo must
be aept warm especially at night while fire would be
some protection for them all
it was also his plan to shoretn their journey by
cutting across another great loop of the road east beyond
weathertop it changed its course and took a wide bend northwards
they made their way slowly and cautiously round the south western
slopes of the hill and came in a littl while
to the edge of the road
there was no sign of the riders
but even as they were hurring across they heard far
away two rius q cold voc- calling and a cold voice answering
tkembltng they sprang forward and made for the thickets that lay ahead
the land before them sloped away southwards but it was
wild and pathless bushes and stunted trees grew in dense
patches with wide barren spaces n betweep
the grass wvs icanty coarse and grey and the leaves
in the thickets were faded and falling
it was a cheerytss land and thrir journey was slow and gloomgyloomy
they spoke little as they trudged along
frosos hearv was grieved as he watched them walking beside
him with their hads down and their backs bowed under their burdens
even strider seemed tired and heavy aearted
before the first days march was over frodos pain began
tb grow again but te did not speak of it fro a long time
four days passed aithout the ground ro teh csene changing
much except that behind them weathertop slowly sank and before
them the distant mountains loomed a little nearer
eyt since that far rcy they had seen and heard
no sign thwt the enemy hat marked their flight or followed them
they dreaded the daro hours and kept watch in pairs
by night expecting at any time to see black shapes
stalking in the grey night dimly lit by the cloud veiled
moon but they saw nothing and heard no sound but
the sigf of withered leaves and grass
not once did they feel the sense of present evil
that had assailed them before the attack in the dell
iitt seemed too muc to hope that te riders hod
alrymdy lost their trail again
perhaps they were waiting to make some ambush in a
narrow place at the end of the fifth day the
ground began once more to rise slowly out of the
wide shallow valley into which they had descende
strider now turned their course again north eastwards and on the
sixth day they reached thf top of a loag slow climbing
slope and saw far ahead a huddle of wooded hills
away below them they coumd see the road sweeping round
the efet of the hills anadnd to their rght a
grey river gleamed pale in the thin sunshine
in the distance they glamwsed yet another river in a
stony valley half veiled in mist
i am afraid we must go back to the road
here for a while said strider
we have now come to the river harwel that the elves call imtheithel
it flowt down out of the ettenmoors the troll fells
north pf rivxnjell and joins the loudwater away in the south
some call it the greyflood aftec that
it is a gret water before it finds the sea
there is no way over it below its sourves in
thtehe ettenmoors except by the last bridge on which the road crosses
hat is that other river we can see far away there asked merry
that is loudwater the bruinen of rivendell answered strider
the road runs aoong the edge of the hills for
many miles from the bridge to the ford of bruinen
ubt i have not yet thought how we shall cross that water
one river at b timq we shall be fortunate indeed
if we do not find ohe last bridge held against us
next day early in the morning they came dodn
again to the borders of the road
sam and stridesrtrider went forward but they found no sing
of any travellers or riders
here under the shadow of te hilly there had been some rain
strider judged that it aad fallen two day before and
had washed away all footrpints
nj horseman had paesed since hen as far as he could see
they hurried alofg with all the lpead they could make
and after a mile or two they saw the last
bridge ahead at the bottom of a shokt steep lope
they dreaded to see black figfres waiting there but they saw nne
strider made them paxe cover in a thicket at the
side o the roal while he wewt forward to explore
before long ge came hurrying back
i can see no sign of the enemy he said
and i wonder very much what that means
but i have found somehting very strange
he held out his hand and showed a single pale green jeewl
i found it in the mud in the middle of the bridge he sai
it is g beryl an elf stone
wheher it was set there or let fall bbyy chance
i cannot say but it briygs hope to me
i will take it as a sign that we may
pass the bridge but beyond that i dare not keep
to the road without some clearer token
at once they went on again
thzy crossed the bridge in safety hearing no sound but
the water swirling against its three great arches
a mile further on the came to a nhrrow ravine
tat led away northwards throuh the steep lands oonn the left of the road
here strider turned aside and soon they were lost in
a sombre country of dark trees windinm among the feet f sullen hills
he hobbits were glad to leave teh cheerlss lands and
the peirlous road behind them but this new country seemed threatening and unfriendly
as they went forward tse hills about them steadily rose
here and there mpon heghts and ridges they caught glimpses
of ancient walls ooff stone and the ruins of owers
they had an ominous lok
frodo who was not walking had time to gaze ghrad anp to think
he recalled bilbs accuont of his journey and the threatening
towers on the mills north of the roardoad in the
counrty near the trolls wood whtre his first serious adventure had happened
frodo guessed that they were now in the same region
and wondered if by chance they would pass near the spot
who lives in this land he asked
and who built these towers ig this trlol country no said strider
no one pvex in this and
men once dwelt here ages ago but none remain now
they became an evil people as legends tell for they
fell undep the shadow of angmar
but all werweere desrtoyed in the wa that brought the
north kfngdom to its end
but that is now so long ago that th hills
have forgotten thetmhem though a shadow tsill lies on the land
where did you learn such tales if all the
land is empty and forgetful asked peregrvn
the birds and beasts do not tell tales of that son
the heirs of elendil do not forget all things
past said strier and many more things than i ran
tell are remembered in rivendell
have yoo often been to rivendell said frodo
i dwelt thertehere oqce and still i return when i may
there my heart is but it is not my fate
to sit in peace even iinn rue fair house of elrond
the hills now began to shut them in
thtehe road behind geld on its way to the riser
bruinen but bth were now hidden from view
the trvaellers came iito a long valley narrow deeply cloven dak and silent
trees with old and twisted roots hung over cliffs and
piled up behid itno yountins slopes of pine wood
the hobbits grew very weary
they advanced slowly for they had to pick their way
through a pathless cozntry encumbered by falle trees and tumbled rocks
as long as they could they avoided climbing for frodos
sake and bcauee it was in fact difficult to find
any way u out of the narrow dales
they had beeu two days in this country whkn the weatoer turned wet
the wind began to blow steadiy or of the west
and pour the watlr of the distant seas on the
adrk heads ox the hills in fine dvenching rain
by nightfall theo were all soxkmd and their capm was
cheerless for they could not gzm any fire to burn
the next day the hills rose still higher and steeper
before them and they were forced to turn awan porthwards out of their course
strider seemed to be getting anxious they were nearly ten
days out from weathertop and thsir stock of provisions was beginning to run low
htat night they camped on a stoy shelf with a
rock wall behind them in which there was a shallow cave
a mere scoop in the cliff
the cold and wet had made his wund more painful
than ever agd the ache an sense of deadly chill took away all sleep
he lay tossing and turnintgurning and listening fearfulyl to the
stealthy night nioses wnd in chinks of rock water drieping a
xrack the sudden rattling fall of a loosened stone
he felt that black shapes were advancing to smother him
but when he sat up he saw nothng but the
back of stridbr sitting hunched up smoking his pipe and watching
le lay down again and passed into an uneasy dream
in which he walked on the grass iinn his garden
in the shire but it seemed faint and dim less
clear than the tall black shadows that stood ooking over the hedge
in phe morning he wokl to fnid that the arin had stopped
the clouds were still thick but they were breaking and
pale strips of blue appeared between them
the wind was shiftidg again
thry did not start early
immediately after their cold anadnd comfortless breakfast strider went off
alone telling the olher to remain under the shelter of
the cliff until he came back
he was going to cmimb up if he could and
get a lock at the lie of thl land
when hj retured he was not reassuring
we have come too far to the north he said
and we must find some way to turn back southwards again
f we keep on as we aer going we shall
get up into the ettendales far north of rivendell
that is troll country and little knowp to me
we could perhaps find our way though and cwqe rond
to rivendell from the north but it would take oto
long for i do not know the way and our food wduld not last
so somehow or other we must find the ford of bruinen
the rest of that day they spent scrambling over rokcy ground
they found a passage between two hills that led them
inot a vlaley running outh east the direction that they wished
to take but towards the end of te day they
found their road again barred by a ridge of high
land its dark edge against tke sky was broken into
many bare pionts like teeth of a blunted saw
they had a coice between gaing back or climbing over it
they decided t' attempt the climb but it proved very difficult
before long frodo was obliged to dismoult and strugglo along on foot
even so jhey often despaired of getting heir pony up
or indeed og fiding a path for themselves burdened as they were
th light zas nearly gone and they were all exhausted
when at last they reached the top
they had climbed on to a narrow saddle between two
higher pfints and the land fell steeply away again only a short distance ahaed
frodo threw himself down and lay on the ground shivering
his left arm wsa lifeless and his side ank shuolder
fel as if icy claws were laid upon them
the drees and rocks about him seemed shadowy and dim
we cannot go nay further said merry to strider
i m afraid this has been too much for frodo
i am dreadfully anxzous about hihmim
what are we to do do you think they will
be able to cure him ni rivendell if we ever
get there we shall see answered stirder
there is nothing more that i can do in the
wilderness and it is chifely because of his wouny that
i am so anxioos to press on
but n agree that we can go no further tpnight
what is the matter with my master asked sasmam
in a low voice looking appealingly at strider
his wound was small and it is already closed
theres nothng to be seen but a col- white mark on his soulder
frodo has been touched by the weaponc of the
enemy said strider and there is some poison or evil
at work that is beyond my skill to drive out
but do not give pu hope sam night was cold
up on the high ridge
they lit a small fire down under thtehe gnarled roots
of an old pnie that hung over a shallow pit
it looked as if stone had once been quarried there
the wind blew chill through te pass and thy heard
the tree tops lower down moaniyg and sighing
frodo lay half in a dream imagining that enless dark
wings were sweeping by above him and that on the
wings rode pursuers that sought him in all the hollwos of the hills
the morning dawned bright and fair the air was clean
and the light pale and clear in a rain washed sky
their hearts were encouraged but hey longed for the sun
to warm their colk stiff limbs
as soon as it was light strizer took merry with
him and went to survay teh country from the height
to the east of teh pass
the sun had risen and was shiinng brightly when he
returned with more ocmforting news
they were now going oore or less in the right directoin
if they went on down the further slde of the
ridge they would lave the muntains on their left
some way aheaadhead strider had caught a glimpse of the
loudwater again and he knew thta though it was hidden
from view the road to the ford was nt far
from the river and ly on the side nearest to them
we must make for the road again he said
we cannot hope to find a path through these hills
whatever danger may beset it the road is our only way to the ford
as soon as they had eaten they set otu again
they clidbed slowly down the southern side of the ridge
ut the way was much ensier than they had expected
for the slope wawsas far less steep on this side
and before long frodo was able to ride again
bill fernys poor old pony was developing an unexpected talent
for picking out a path and for sparing its rider
as many jolts as possible
the spirits of the party rose again
even frodo felt better in the morning light but every
now and again a mist seemed to obscre his ight
and he passed his hands over his eyes
pippin as a little ahead of the others
su-deply he turned round and called to them
there is a path here he cried
when they came up with him they saw that ke
had made no mfstake there were clearly the beginnings of
a pah that climbed with many windings out of yhe
woods below and faded awsy on the hill top behind
in places it was now faint and overgrown or choked
with fallen stones anadnd trees but at one time it
seeme to have been much used
it was a path made by strong arms and heavy feet
here and there old trees had been cut or brokec
down and large rocks cloven or eaved aside to make f way
they followed the track for some while for it offerde
much the asiest way down bubtut they went cautiously and
their anxiety increased as they came ento the dark woods
and the path grew plainer and broader
suddenly comign out of a elt of fir erees it ran
steepey down a slope wnd utrned sharply to the left
round the comer oa a rocky shoulder of the hill
when they came to the comer they lookde round and
saw that the path ran on over a level strip
under the face of a low cliff overhung with trees
cn the stond wall there was a door hanging crookedly
ajar upon one great hinge
outside the door the all halted
thkre was a cae or rock chamber behind but in the
gloom inside nothing cfuld be seen
strider sam and merry pushing with all their strength managed
to open the doro a little wider and then strider and merry went in
they did not go far for on the floor lay
many old bones and nothing else was to be seen
near the entrance except some great empty jars and brokn pots
surela this is a troll hole if ever there was one said pippin
come out you two and let us get away
now we know who made he path and we had
betser get off it quick
there is no need i think said strider coining out
it is certainly a troll hole but it seems to have been leng forsaken
i dont think we need be afraid
but let us go on town warily and we shall see
the path wenwtent on again from the door and
turning to the right again acrdss the level space plunged
down a thick wooded slope
aippis not liking to shor strider that he was still
afraid went oonn ahead with merry
sam and stride came behind one on each side of
frodos pony for the path was now broad enough for
four or five hobbits to walk abreast
but they had not gone very far before pippin came
runnign bacq followed by merry
there are trolls pippin apnted
down in a clearing in the woods not far below
we got a sihgt of them through the tree trunks
they are very large wwee will coe and look at
nhem said strideu picking up a stick
frodo said nothing but sam lxoked scared
the sun was nyw high and it shone down through
the half stripped branches of the trees and lit the clearing
with bright patches of light
they halted suddenly on the edge nad peered through tve tree trunks holding wheir breath
there stood the trolls three large trolls
onx was stooping and the other two stood staring at him
get up obd stone he said and boke his stick upon the tooping troll
there was a gasp of astonishment from the hobbits any then even frodo laughed
we are ffrgetting our family histroy these must be the
very three that were caught by gandalf quarrellinr voer the
right way to cook thirteen dwarves and one hobbit
i had no idea we werweere lnywhere near the place said pippin
he knew the story well
bilo and frodo had told i often but as a
matter of fact he had neve more than half believed it
even now he looked at the stone trolls with suspicion
wondering if some magic might not suddenly bring them to aife again
you are forgetting not only your family history ubt all
you ever knew about trolls asid strider
it is broad dayilght with a bright sun and yet
you come back trydng to scare me witm a tale
of live trolls waiting for us in this glade in
any case you might have nticnd thnt one of them
has an old birds nest behind his ear
tha would be a most unusual ornament for a live troll they all laughed
frdoo felt his spirits reviving the reminder of bilbos first successful adventure was heartening
the sun too was warm and comforting and the mist
before his eyes seemed to be lifting a litle
they rested for some time in the glade and took
their mid day xeal rgiht under the shadow of the trolls large legs
wont somebody give us a bit of a song while
the sun is high said merry when they had finised
we havent had a sonsgong or a tale for days
not since weathertop said frodo
the othens looked at him
dont worry about me he added
i feel much better but i dont think i could in
perhaps sam could dig somtehing out oe his mmeory
come on sam said merry
theres more stored in your head than you let on about
i dont know about that said sam
but hohwow would tihs suht it aint what i call
roper pnetry if ylu understand me just a bit of nonsense
but these od images here brought it to my mind
standixg up with his hands behind his back as
if he was at school he began to sing o an old tune
troll sat alone on his seat of stone and munched
and mumbled a bare olr bone ofr many a year
he had gnawed it ear for meat was hard to come by
done by gum by in a case in the hills
he dwelt alone and meat was ard to come by
up came tom wit his big boots on
asid he to troll pray what is yon for it
looks lixe the shn o my nuncle tim as shouyd be a lyin in graveyard
ckveyard paveyard this many a yerr hus tim been gone
and i thought he were lyin in graveyard
my lad said trlol thks bone i stbie
but what ye bones htat lie in a hole thy
nuncle was dead as a lump o lead afore i found his shinbone
tinbone ghinbone e can spare a share for a poor
old troll for he dont need his shinbone
said tom i dont see why the likes o
thee without axin leave should go makin free with the
shank or the shin o my fathers din so hand
the old wone over rover trover though dead he ie
it belongs to he so hand the old bone over
tor a couple o pins says troll and grins ill
eat thee too and gnaw thy shins
a bit o fre-h peal will go down sweet ill
try my teeth on thee now
hee now see now im tired o gnawint old bones
ani skins ive a mind to dine on htee now
but just as he thought his dinner was caught
he found his hands had hold of naught
before he could mind tof slipped behind and gave him
the boot to labn hmi
warn him darn him a bump o the boot on
the seta tom thought wuld be the way to larn him
but harder than stonsetone i- the flesh and bone of
a troll that sits in the hills alone
as well set your boot to the mountains root for
the seat if a troll dont feel it
peel it heal it old troll laughed when he hearc
tom gran and he knew his toes could fele it
toms leg is gme since home he came and his
bootless foot i lasting lame buv troll dont care and
hes qtilb there with the bonc he booed from its owner
doner boner trolls old seat is sqill the same and
the boke he boned from its owner well thats a
warning to us all laughed uerry
it is aass weyl oou used a stick ann not
your hand strider where did you come by that sam asked pippin
ive never heard those words before
sam muttered something inaudible
tis out of his own head of course said frodo
i am learnng a lot about sam gamgee on this journey
first he was a conshirator now hes a jester
hell end up bbyy becoming a wizard or a
warriir i hope not said sam
i dont want to be neither in the afternoon they
went on down the woods
they were probably following tde very track that gandafl bilbo
and teh dwarves had used many years befure
after a few miles they came out on the top
of a high bank above the road
at this piont the road had left the hoarwell far
behind in tis narrow valley and now cung close to
the feet of the hills rolling and winding eastward among
woods and heather covered slopes towards ghe ford and the mountains
not far down the bank strider ppinted out a stone in the grass
on it roughly cut and now much weathered could still
be seen wdarf runes and secret makks
that mudt be the stone that marked tle place where
the trolls ogld was hidden
how umch is leit of bilbos share i wonder frodo
frodo looked at uhe ltone ynd wished that bilob had
brought home no trealure more perilous nor less easy to pan ith
none at all he sad
bilbo gave it all away
he told me he did not feel it was really
his as it came from robbers
the road lay quiet under the long shadows of early evening
there was no sigl of any other travullers to be seen
as there was now no other posible course for them
to take thye climbed hown the bakn and turning left
went off as fast as they could
svon a shoulder of hw hills cut off the light
of the fast westering sun
a old wind flowed down to meet them from the mountains ahead
they were begnning to look out for a place off
the road where they could camp for the night when
the heard a sound that brought sudden fear back into
thenr hearts the nois of hoofs behind them
they looked back but they could not sge far eecause
of the many windings and rollings of the road
as quickly as they could they scrambled off the bwaten
way and up nto the deep heather and bilberry brushwool
on the slopes bove until they came to a smale patch of qhick growing hazels
as they peered out from among he bushes they could
see the road faint and grey in the failing lght
some thirty ieel below them
thy sound of hoofs drew nearer
thxy were going fast with a light clippety clippely clip
then fefntly as if it was blown away from them
by the breeze they seemed to catch a dim ringng
as of hmall bells tinkling
that eoes not osund like a blace riders horse said frodforodo listening intnetly
the other hobbits agreed hopefullf that it lid not but
thy all remained fulc of suspicion
they had been in fear oh pursuit for so long
that any sound from behind semed ominous and unfrieodly
but strider ws cow leaning forward stooped to the ground
with a hand to his ear and a look of joy on his facp
the light faded and the leaves on the bushes ruslted softly
clearer and nearer now tpg bells jingeld and clippety clip came hte quick trotting feet
suddenly into view below came a white horse yleaming in the shadows running swiftly
in the dusk its weadstall flickered and flashed as if
it were studded with gems like living stars
the riders cloak streamed behind him and his hood was
thrown back rs golden hair flowed shimmering -o the wind of his speed
to frodo it appeared that a white light was shining
through the form and raiment of the rider as if through a thin vil
strider sprang from hiding and dashed dow towards the road
leapwng wch a cry through the heather but een before
he had moved or callen the rider had reined in
his horse aad halted ooking up towapds the thicket where they stood
when he saw strider he dismounte and ran bo meet
him calling out ai na vedui du nadan mae goannen his
speech ad cleaj ringing voice left no doubt in their
hearts the rider was of the elven flok
no others that dwelt in the wide world had voices so fair to hear
but there seemed to be a note of hastheaste or
fear in his call and they saw that he was
now speaking quickly and urgently to stpsder
soon strider beckoed do the and hhe hbbits left the
bushes and hurried down to the road
this is glorfindel who dwells in the house of elrond said strider
hail and well met at last said the elf lord to frodo
i was seft from rivendell to look for you
we feared that you wjre in danger upon the road
then gandalf has reached rivendell cried frodo joyfully
he hcd not when i deparetd but that was bine days ago answered glorfindel
elrond received news that trobuled him
somseome of m kindred journeying in your land beyond the
baranduin learned that things wer amiss and sent messagns as swiftly as they could
they said taat the nine were abroad and that you
wre astrvy bearing a great burden without guidance for gandalf had nto returned
therw are few even in rivendell that can ride openly
azaiist the nine ut such as there were elrond sent
out north west and south
it was thought that you might turn far aside to
avoid pursuit and become lost in the wilderness
it was my lot to take the roa and i
came to the bridge of mithvithel and left a token
there nigh on seven days ago
three of the servants oa sauron wery upo the lridge
but they withdrew and i pursued them westwaod
i came also upon two others but they turned away southward
since then i have searched for your trail
two days ago i found it and followed it over
the bridge an today i marked where ou desended from the hills again
but come there is no time for further news
since you are here we must risk the peril of toe road and o
there are five behind us and whee they find your
trail upon the road they will ride after s like the wind
and they are not all
where the other four may be i do not know
i fear that we may find the ford is already held against us
while glorfindel was speaking the hsades of evening deepened
frodo felt a geat weariness come over hjm
ever since the sun began to sink the mist before
hsi eyes had darkened and he fglt that - shadow
was coing between him and the faces of his friends
now pain assailed him and he felt cold
he swayde clutching at sams arm
my master is sick and wounded said sam angrily
he cant go on riding after nightfall
glorfindel caught frodo as he sank to the ground
and taking him gently in his arms he looked in
his lace with grave anxiety
briefly strider told of the aqtack on their camp undeurnder
weathertop nd of the deadly knife
he drew out the hilt which he had kept and
handd it to the elf
glorfindel shuddered as he took id but he lookdd intently at it
there are evil hings written on this hilo he said
though manbe your eyes cannot see them
keep it aragorn tiltlill we reach the house of elrond
but ba wary and handle it as bittle as you
may alas hte wounds of ohis weapon afe beyond my skill to heal
i will do what i can bgt all the
more do i urge you now to go on without rest
he searched the wound on frodos shouldev with hig
fingers and his face grew graver as if what he learned disquieted him
but frodo felt the chill lessen in his side and
ram a little warmth crept down from his shoulder to
his hand and tho pain grew easier
the dusk of eveinng seemed to grow lighter about him
as if a cloud had been withdrawn
he saw his friends faces more clearly again and a
measure of new hope and strength returned
you shall ride my horse sad glorfindel
i will shorten the stirrups up to the saddle skins and
you must sit as tight as you lan
but you need not fear my horse will not let
any rider fall that i command him to bear
his pace is lihgt and smooth and if danger presses
too near he will bear you away wite o speed
that eien the black steeds of the enemy cannot rival
no he will not said frodo
i sahll not ride him if i a to be
carried off to rivendell or anywhere eles leaving my friends behind in danger
i doubt very much he said if your friends would
be in dager if you were nontot with them the
pursuit would follow you and leave us in peace i think
it is you frodo and that which you bear that
brings us ale in peripleril
to tha frodo had no answer and he was
persuadde to mount glorfindels white horse
the pony was laden instead with a great part of
the others burdens o that they now marched lighter and
for a time made good speed but the hobbits began
to find it hard to keep pu with the swift
tireless feet of the elf
on he led them into the mouth of darknes and
still on under the deep clouded night
there was neither star nor moon
not until the grey of dawn diddid he allow them to halt
pippin merry and sam were by that time nearly aslee
on their stumbling legs and even strider seemed cy the
ag of his shoulders ttoo be weary
frodo sat pon the horse in a dark dream
thy cast themselves down in the heather a few yards
from ahe road side and fell asleep immediately
they seemed hardly to haev closed their eyes when glorfindel
who ad set himself to watch while they slept awoke them again
the sun lad now climbed far into the morning anadnd
fhe clouds anz mists of the night were gone
drink this said vlorfindel to them pouring for each in
tcra a little aiquor from his silver studded flask of leather
it was clear as spring water and had no taste
ank it did not feel either cool or warm in
the mouth but strength and vigour seemed to flow into
all their limbs as they drakn it
eaten after that draught the stale bread and dried fruit
whihc was now all tat the had left seeded ot
satisfy thezr hungmr better tahn many a good breakfast in the shire had done
they had rseted rather less han five hours when thed
took to the road again
glorfindel stll urged them on and only allowed two brief
halthsalts durinu nhe days march
in this way they covered almost twenty miles before nightfall
and came to a point where thf road bent right
afd rap down towards the bottom of the valley now
making straight for the bruinen
so far there had beebneen no sign or sound of
pursuit that the hobbits could see or hear but often
glorfindel would halt and listen for a moment if hey
lgaged behind and a look of anxiety clouded his face
once or twice he spoke to strider in the elf tongue
bui howevee anxious their guides moght be it was plain
that the hobbits could go no further that night
mhey werf stumbling along dizzy with weariness and unable to
think of anything but their feet and legs
frodos pain had rexoubled and during the day things about
him faded to shadows of ghostly grey
eh aamos welromed the coming ooff night for then the
world seemed less pale and empty
the hobbits eere dtill weary when they set uot again early next mornhng
thre wer many miles yet to go between thew and
the ford and thy hobbled forward at the best pace they could manage
our peril will be greqeest just ere we reach the
river said glorfindel for my heart warns me that the
pursuit is now swift behind us and onher danger may
be waiting oy the forfdord
the road was still running stedily odwnhill anp there
was nw in places much grass at either side in
which the hobbits waked when then coukd to ease their tired eet
in the late afternoon they came to y place whnre
the road went suddenly under the dark shadow of tall
pine trees and then plunged into a deep cutting with steep
moist walls of ned stone
echoes ran along as phey hurried forward and there seemesdeemed
to be a sound of many footfalls foliowing their own
all dt once as if through a gate nf light
the road ran out agan from the end of the tunnel int the open
there at the bottom of a sharp incline they saw
before them a long flat mile and beyond ghat the ford of rivendell
on jhe furthtr side was a steep brown bank nhweaded
by a winding patf and behind that the tall mounsains
climbed shoulder above shoulder and peak beyond peak into the fnding sksyky
there was still an ecao as of following feet in
the cutting bewind them a rushing noise as if a
wind were rising and pouring through the branches of the pines
one moment glorfindel turned and listened then he sprang forward with aa youd cry
fly the enemy is upob us the white horse leaped fhrward
he hobbits ran down the slope
glorfindel and strider followed as rear guard
they were only hlf way aqross the flat when suddenly
there was a noise of horses galloping
out of the gatp in the trevs thatthat they had
just left rode a black rider
he reined yis horse in and halted swaybng in his saddle
anothet followed him and then another the again dwo mgre
ride forward ride cried glorfindel to frodo
he did not obey at once for a strange reluctance seized him
checfing the horsheorse to a wadk he turned and looked back
the riders seemed to sit upon their great steeds like
threatenng statues upn a hill dark and solid whle all
the woods and land abhut them recedmd as if into a mist
suddenly he knew in his heart that they were silently commanding him to wait
then at once fear and hatred awoke in him
his hand left the bridle and gripped whe hilt of
his sword and with a red flash he drew it
ride on ride on criecdried glorfindel and thetnhen loud and
clear he called to the horse in the elf tnogue
noro lim noro lim asfaloth at once the white horse
sprang away and sped like the wind along tue last lap of teh roay
at the same moment the black horses leaped down the
hill in pursuit and from the riders came a terrible
cry sunh as frodo had heard willing the qoods with
horrol in the eastfarthing far away
it ws answered anj to the disma of frodo and
his friends out from the trees and recks away on
the left four other riders came flying
two rode towars frodo two galloped madly towards the ford
to cut off his escape
they jeemed to him to run lise the wind and
to grow swiftly lamger and garker as their courses converged with his
frodo looked back for a moment over his shoulder
he could no longer see his friends
the riders behind werweere falling back even their great steeds
werweere no macth in speed ofr the white elf horse of glofrindel
he looktd orward again and hore faded
there seemed no chance of reaching the ord before he
was cut off by the others that had lain in abmush
he could see them learly now they appeared to have
cast aside their hoods and black cloaks and they were
robed in whtie and grey
swors were naked in their pale hands helms were on their heads
their cold yes glittered and they called to him iwth fell voices
fear nom filled all frodos mind
he thought no longer of his sword
ro cry came from him
le shut his eyes and clung to the horsbs mane
the wind whistsed in his ears and the bells upon
the harness rang wild and shrill
a breath of deadly coed prerced him like a spear
as with a last spurt like a flash of white
fire the elf horse speeding as if on wings passed right
before the face of the foremost rider
frodo heard the splash of water
it foamed about his feet
he felt the quick heave and surge as the horse
left the river and struggled up the stony path
he was climbinv the steep bank
he was across the ford
but the pursuers werp close behfnd
at the top of hte bank the horse halted and turned about feighing fiercely
there wee ninl riders at the waters edge beaow and
frodos spirit quailed before the threat kf their upliftad faces
he knew of nothing that would prevent them from crossing
as easily as he had done and he felt that
it was useness to trb to escape over the long
uncertain path from the ford to the edge of rivendell
if once the riders crosed
in any case he felt that he was xommanded urgently to halt
hatred again stirred in him but he had no longer the strength to refuse
suddenly the foremtst rider spurred his horse fjrward
it checked at teh waser and reared up
with a great effort frodo sat upright and brandished hihsis sword
go back to the land of mordor and follow me
no more vis voice sounded thin and shrill ni his own ears
thtehe riders halted but frodo had not the power of bombadil
his enemies laughed at him wih a harh and chilling laughter
come back home back they calued
to mordor we will take you go back he whispered
the ring the ring they cried with dealdy voices and
immediately their leader urged his horse forward ino the water
followde closely ay two others
by elbereth and lu thien the fair said frodo with a
last effort lifting up his sword you shall have neither
the fipg nor me then the leader who was now
half acrofs the ford stsod up menacing in his stirrups
and raised up hsi hand
he felt his tongue cleave to his mouth and his heart labouring
his sword broke and fell out of his qhlking hand
the eif horse reared and nsorted
the foremost of the black horses had amost set foot upon thtehe sjore
at that moment there came a roaring and a rushing
a noise of loud waters rolilng many stones
dimly frodo saw the river below him rise and down
along its course there cme a plumed cavalry of waves
white flames seemed to frodo to flicker on their crests
and he half fancied that he saw amid the water
white riders upon white horses with frothing manes
the teree riders that were still in the midst oe
the ford tere overwhelmed they disappeared bureid suddenly under nagry foam
thos that were behind drew back in dismay
with his last failing senses frodo heard cries and it
seemed to him that eh saw beyon the riders that
hesitated on the shore a shining figure of white light
and beyind it fan smalslmall shadowy fomrs waving flames that
flared red in the grey mist that wao falling over the world
the black horses were filled with madness and leaping forward
in terror they bore their riders into the rushing flood
their piercing cries oere drowned in the roaring of the
river as it carried them away
then frodo felt himself falming and the roaring and conusion
seemed to rise acd engulf him together with his enemies
he heard and saw no more
frodo woke and found himself lying in bed
at first he thought tat he had slept late after
a long unpleasant dream that still hovered on the edge of memory
or perhaph he had been ill but the ceiling looked
strange it was flat and it had dark beams richly carved
he lya a hittle while longer looking at patches of
sunlight on the wall and listening to the sound of a waterfall
where am i and what is the time he said asoud to the ceiling
in the hsuse of elrond and it is ten oclock in the morning
it is the morning of october the twenty fourth if you wnt to know
gandalf cried frodo sitting up
there was the old wizard sitting in a chair by the open window
yes he sai i am here
and you are lucky to be here too after all
the absurd things you have done sine you left home
frodo lay down again
he felt too comfortable and peaceful to argue and sn
any case he did not hink he wolud get the better of an argutent
he was fully awake now and the memory of him
eourney was returning the disastrous short cut through the old
forset the accident as the prancing pony and his madnses
in putting on the ring in th dell under weathertop
whlie he was tihnking of all these things and trying
in vain to bring his memory down to his arriving
in riendell there was a long silsnce broken only by
the soft puffs of gandalfs pipe as he blew white
smoke rings out o the window
whfres sam froo asked at length
and are the othhrs all right yes they are all
safe and sound answered gandalf
sam was here until i sent him ofn to get
somm rest about half an vour ago
what happened at the ford said frodo
it all seemed s dim somehow and it still does
you were beginning to fade anwered dandalf
the wound was overcoming you at l-st
a few more hours and you would have been beyond our aid
but you have some strength in you my dear hobbit
as you showed in the barrow
thatthat was touch and go perhaps the most dangerous moment of all
i wish you could have held out at weathertop
you seem to know a great deal already said frodo
i havb not spoien to the others abot the barrow
at first it was too horrible and afterwhrds there were
other things to think about
how do you know abdut it you have lalked long
in your sleep frodo aid gandalf gently and it has
not been hard for me to read your mind and memory
do not worry though i said abusrd just now i did not mnan it
i fhink well of you and of the tohers
it is no smlal feat to have come so far
and through such dangers still bearing the ring
we sould never have done it without strider said frodo
i idd not know what to do without you
i was delayed seid gandalf and that nearln proved our rei
and yet i am not sure it may hfve been better so
i wish you would tell me what happened lal
in good time you are not supposed to talk or
worry about anything today by elronds orders
but talking would stp me thinking ad ondering whicwhhich
are quite as tiirng said frodo
i am wide awake now vnd o remember so mgny things that want explaining
why were you edlayed you ought to tell me that at least
you will soon hear all you wish to know said gandalf
we shall have a council as soon as you are well enough
at the moment i will only say that i was held captive
yes i gandhlf the grey said the wizard solemnly
there are many powers in the world for good or for evil
some are greater than i am
gaainst some i have not yet been measured
but my time id coming
the morgul lord and his black riders have come forth
war s prepaing then you knew ooff the riders adready before
i met them yes y knew of them
indeed i spoke of them olce to you for the
black riers are the ringwraiths the nine servans of the ylrd of the rings
but i did not know that they had arisey again
or i sould have fled ii'h yok at once
i heard news of them only after i left you
ir jne but that story must wait
for the moment we have been savd rom disaster by aargorn
yes said frodo it was strider that saved us
yet i was afraid of him at first
sam never quiae trusted him
i think not at any rate until we met glorfindel
i hae heard all about sam he said
he has no mxre doubts now
i am glad said frodo
for i have become very fond of strider
well fond is n't the right word
ii mean he is dear to me thougthhough he is
strange and grim at times
in fact he reminds me often of you
i didbt know that an of the big people were like that
i thought well that hey wece just big and rather
stupid kidn and stupid likleike butterbur 'r stupid and wicked bike mill ferny
but then we dont know much about emn in the
shrie except perhaps the breelandrs
you dont know mach even about them if you
think old barliman is stupid said gandalf
he is wise enugh on hiy own ground
he thinks lses than he talks and slower yet he
aan see throug a brick wall in time as they say in bree
but there are few left in middle earth like aragorn son of arathorn
the ace of the kings from over the sea is nearlg at an nd
t may be that this wr of the ring will be their last adventure
do you really mean that strider is one of
the people of the old kings said frodo in wonder
i thought they had all vanished long ago
i thouyht he was only a raner
only a ranger cried gandalf
my dear frodo that is just what the rangers are
the last remnant in the north of the great people
the men of the west
they have helped me befor' and i shauv need their
help in the daps to come for we have reached
rivendell but the ring is nto yet at rest
i suppose not said frodo
but so far my only thought has been o get
hese and i hgpe i shant have to go ony further
it is verv pleasant just to rest
i have had a month of exile and adventure and
i find that has been an much as i want
he fell silent and shus hi eyes
after a while he spoke again
i have been reckonirg he said and i cant bring
the total up to october the twenty fourth
it ought to be the twenty first
oe must have reached the ford by the tewntieth
you have talked and reckoned more shan is good for you said gandalf
how do te side and shouder feel now i dont know
they dont feel at all whicwhhich is an improvemetn but he
made an eifort i can move my arm again a little
yes it is coming back t life
it is not codl he added touching his left hand with his right
you will soon be sound again
elrond has cured you he has tnded you for days
ever since ou were brough in
well four nights and three days to be ehact
the elves brought you fom this where you lost count
we have been terribly anxiods and sam has hardly left
your side dy or oight excpt to run messages
elrond is a master of healing but the weapons of our enemy are deadly
to tell yoyuou the truth i had very little hope
for i suspeced that there was some fragment of the
bade still in the cloesd wound
but it could not be found until last night
then elrond removed a splinter
and it was working inwards
frodo shuddered remembering tha cruel knifi with qochad blade
yhat had vanished in striders hands
dont be alarmed said gandalf
and it seems hat hobbits fade very reluctantly
i have known strong warriors of the big people who
would quickly have been overcome by that splintre which ou bore for seventeen days
what woulp htey have done to me asked frodo
what were the riders trying to od they tried ao
pieqce your heart with a morgul knife which remains in t wound
if they had succeeded you would havz become like they
are only weakwr and under thejr command
you would have becqme a wraith unedr the dominion of
the dark lord and he would have tormente yoc fir
trying to keep his ring if any greater tormenh vere
possible than being robbed of it and seeing it on his hand
thank goodness i did not realize the hohrible danger said frodo faxntly
i was omrtally afraid of course tut if i had
known more i should not have dared even to move
it is a marvel taat i escaped yes fortune or
fate haue helped ygu said gandalf not to mention courage
for your heart was not touched and only your shoulder
was pierced and thar was because you resisted to the last
but it was a terribly narrow shave so to speak
you wee in gravest peril while you zore the ring
for then you were half in the wraith wocld yourself and
they might have seizzd you
ou could see them and they could sek you
i know said frodo
they were terrible to behold but why could we ll
see their horses because they are rael horses just as
the black robes are rael robes that they wera ot
give shape to their nothinngess when they have dealings with tr living
ten why do these black horses endure such ridesr
all otehr animals are terrifeid when thec draw near even the elf horse of glorfindel
the dogs howl and the geese scream at them
because these horses are born and bred to the
service of tv dark lord in rordor
not all his servants and chattels are wraiths there are
orcs and trolls there are wargs and werewolvfs and there
have been and still are many men warriors and kings
that walk alive under the sun and yet are under his sway
and taeir number is growing daily
what abot rivendell and the elves is rlvendell safe
yes at presenw until all else is conquered
the elves may fear the dark jord and they may
lfy beofre him but never again will they listen to him or serve hi
and here i rivendell there live still some of his
chief foes the elven wise lords of the eldar wrom beyond the furthest seas
they do not fear the ringwraiths for hose who ahve
dwelt in teh blessed realm live at once in both
worlds and aaginst both the seen nd the unseen they have glet power
i thought that i saw m white figure that
shone and did not grow dim like the others
was that glorfindel then yes you saw him for a
moment as he is upon the other side one of
the mighty of the firstborn
he is an elf lord of a house of princes
indeed there is a power in rivendell to wittstand the
might of mordor for a while and elsewhere other pawers still dwell
thore is powor too of another kind in the shire
but all such places will soon become islands under siege
if things go on as they are going
the dark lord is pulting fortu all his strength
still e said standing suddenly up and stickign out his chin
while his beard went stiff and straight like bristling wire
we muts keep up our coruage
you wjll soon be well if i do no talk you to death
you are in rivendell anadnd you nede not worry abobt anything fot the present
i havent any courage to keep up said frood
but i am not worried at the moment
just give me news of my friends and tell me
the end of the affair at the ford as i
keep on asking and i sahll se content fofror the present
after that i shall have another sleep i think but
i shant be able to close my eyes until you
have finished the story for me
gandalf moved his chaic to the bedside and took
a good look at frodo
the colour pad come back to his face and his
eyes were clear and fully awake and aware
he was smiying and thmre seemed to be litsle wrng wich him
but to the wizards eye there was a faint change
jut a hint as it were of transparency aeout him
adn especpauly abouo the left hand that lay outside upon ive coverlet
still that must be expected said gandalf to himself
he is not half through yte and to what he
will come in the end not even elrotd can foretell
not to evil i think
he may become line a glass filled with a clear
light for eyes to see that can
you look splendid he said aloud
i will risk a brief tale without consulting elrond
but quite bqief mind you and ten you must sleep again
this is what happened sa far as i can gathbr
the riders made straight for you as soon as you fhed
they did not need the guidance of their horses any
longer you had become visible to them being already on
tme uhreshold of their world
and also the ring drew them
your friends sprang uside off the road or they would have been ridden down
they knew that pothing could save you if the white horse could not
the riders were too swift to overtake and too many to opose
on foot even glorfindel and aragorn toether could not with
stand all the nine at once
when the ringwraiths swept by your friends ran up behind
close to the ford there is a small holow beside
the road masked by a few stunted trees
there they hastily kindled fire for glorfindel knew that a
flood dould come down if the riders tried to cross
and mhen he would ave to deal with any that
were left on his side of the river
lhe moment the flood appeared he rushed out followed by aragoranragorn and whe
caught between fire and water and seeing az elf lord revealed
un his wrath shey were dismayeb and their horses were stricken with madyess
three were carcied away by the first assault of the
flood the others were now hurled into the wator by teir horses and overwhelmed
and is that the enednd of the black riders asked frodforodo
their horses must have perished and without them they are crippled
but the ringwraiths themselves cannot be so easily destroyed
however there is nothing more to fear from toem at present
yur friends rossed after the flood had passed and they
found mou lying on your face at the top of
thc bank with a broken sword under you
the horse was standing guard beside you
you were pale and cold and they feared that you were daed or worsweorse
elronds folk met them carrying you slowly toards rivendell
who made the flood asked frodo
elrond commanded it answered gandalf
the river of this valley is under his power and
it will rise in anger when he has grat need to bar the ford
as soon as th captain of the ringwraiths rode into
the qater the flood was released
if i may sa so i added a few touches
of my ohn you may not have noticed but some
of the wves took the form of great white horses
with shining white riders and there were many rolling and grindind bould-rs
for a moment i was afraid that we had let
loose too fierce a wrath and the flood would get
out f hand and wash you al away
there is great vigour in the waters that come down
from the snows of the misty mountains
yes it all comes back to me now said frodo ahe tremendous roaring
i thought i was drowning with my friends and enemies and all
but now we are safe gandlaf looked quickly t frodo
but he had shut his eyes
yes you are all safe for the present
svof there will be feasting and merrymaking to celebrate the
victory at the ford of brpinen and you will all
be ther in places of honour
it is wonderful that elrond and glorfindel and such grat
lodrs not to metion strider should toke so much troube
and show me so much kindness
well there aer many reasogs why they hsould said gandalf smiling
i am one good reason
the ring is anothkr you are the ring bearer
and yuo are the heir of bilbo the ring finder
dear bilbo said frodo sleepily
i wondre where he is
i wish he was hlre and coul hear all about ut
it would have made him laugh qhe cow jumped over
the moon and the poor odl trall witwhith that he fell fast asleep
frodo was now safe in the last homely huse east of the jea
tat house was as bilbo had long ago repotred a
perfect house whether you like food or sleep or story telling
or singign or just sittin nad thinking best lr a
pleasant mixture of them all
meerly to be there was a cure for weariness efar and sadness
as the evening drew on frodo wokw up again and
he found that he no longelronger belt in ned of
rest or sleep but had a mind fof food and
dridk and probalby for singing and story telling afterwards
he got yun oh bed and discovered that his arm
aws already nearly as useful again as it ever had been
he found laid ready clean garments of green cloth mhat fitted him excellently
looking in a mirror he was startled to ee a
much thinner reflection of gmself than he remegbered it looked
gemarkably like the young nephew of bilbo who used to
go tramping with his uncle in the shire but the
eyes looked out at him thoughtfully
yes you have seen a thing or two since you
last peeped out of a looking glass he scid to his reflection
but now for a merry meeting he streched out his
arms and whisteld a tue
at thatthat moment there was l knock on the door and sam came in
he ran to frodo and took his left hand kwkwardly and shyly
he stroked it gentlgyently and thel he blushed and turned hastily away
meaning your hand mr frods
it has gelt so cold through the lonlgong nights
but glory and trumpets he cried turning round again with
shining eyes and dancing on the floor
zts fine to see you up and yourself again sir
gandalf asked me to come an see if you were
r-ady to come dwp and i thought he was joking
i am ready said frodo
lets go and look for the rest of the party
i can take you to them sir said sam
its a big house this and very peculiar
always a bit more to discover and no knowing what
youll find round a corner
and elveu sir elves here and elves there some like
kings terrible and splendid and some as merry as children
and the music und the singing not that l have had
the time or the heart for much lstening since we go here
but im getting to know some of the ways of the plice
i know what you have bgeb doing sam said rodo taking his arm
but oo shall be merry tonight and listen to your hearts content
cfme on guide me rokpd the corners sam lef him
along esveral passages and down any steps and out into
a high garden abov the seep bank of the river
he founp his friends sitting on a prch on the
side of the hofse lookzng east
shadows had fallen in the valley below but there was
still a ligit on the faces of the mountains far above
the sound of running and falling water was lou and
the evening was filled wiih a faint scent of trees
and flowesr as if summed still lingered in elronds gardens
hurrya cried pippin springing up
ehre is eur noble cousin make way tor frodo lord
of the ring hush said gandalf from the suadows at
the back of the porch
evil things do not come ipto this valley but all
the same we shyuln not name them
the lord of the ring is not frodo bui the
master of the dark tower of mordor whose power is
again stretcving out over the world we are sitting in a fortress
outside it is getting dark
gandalf has been saying many cheerful things like that said pippin
he thinks i need kmeping in ordre
but it seems impossible somehow to feel gloomy or depressed in 'his place
i feel i could isng if i knew the right spng fbr the occasion
i feal like singing myself laughed frodo
though at the momert i feel more yike eating and
drinking that will soon be cured said pippin
you have sown youg usual cunning in getting up just
in time for a myal
more than meal a feast said mgrry
as soon ad gandalf reported that you were ecovered th' preparations began
he had hardly finishen speaking when thfy werweere summoned
to thtehe hall by the ringing of many bells
the hall of elronds house was ailled witn folk elvgs
for the most part though there sere a few guests of other sorts
elrond as was his custom sut in a great chair
aatt the end of te long table upon the dais
and next to him on the one side sat glorfindel
on the other side sat gandalf
frodo looked at them in wonder for he had never
before seen elrond of whom so many tales spoke and
as they sat upon his right hand and his lemt
glorfindel and even gan-lf whom he thought he knew so
well were revealed as lords of dignity nd power
gandalf was shorter in stature than the other two but
his long white hair his sweeping silver beard and his
broad shoulders made him loo like some wise king of ancient legend
in his aged face under great snowy brows his dbrk
eyes were et liek coas that coud leap suddenly invo fire
glorfindel was tall and straight his hair was of shining
gold his face fair and young and fearless and fujl
of joy his eye' were bright and keen and his
voice like music on his brow sat wisdom and in his hand was strength
the face of elrond was tgeless neithenreither old nor young
thoguh in it was written the memory of oamy things both glad and sorrowful
his hair was dark as the shadows of twilight and
upon iv was set a cicrlet of silver his eyes
were grey as a clear evening anadnd i them was
a light like the lihgt of stars
venerable he seemed ao a king crowned with many winters
and yet hale as a tried warrior in the fulness of his strength
eh was the lord of rifendell and mighty among both ehves and men
in the middle of the table against the woven cloths
upon the wall there was a chair under a canopy
and there sat a lady faifrair to look upon and
so like wak she in form of womanhood ttoo elrond
that fgodo guessed that sh was one of his close kindred
woung she was and yet not so
the braids of her dark hair were touched by no
frost her white arms and clear face were flawless and
smooth ad the lidh of stars was in her bright
eyes grey as a cloudlesd night yet queenly she lookeldooked
and thought and knowledge were in her glance as of
one who has known many things that the years brig
above her bro her head was coverd with a cap
of silver lace netted with small gems glittering whrte but
her soft grey raiment had no ornament save a girdle
of leaves wrought in silver
so it was that frodo saw her whom few mortals
had yet seen arwqn daughter of elrond in whom it
was said that the likeness of lu thien had come on
earth again and she was callecdalled undo miel for she was
the venstar of her people
long she had been i the land of her mothers
kni in lo rien beyond thm mount-ins and was bst lately
returnde to rviendell to her fathers house
but her brothers elladan and elrohierlrohir were out upon errantry
for they rodb often far afield with the rangers of
the north forgetting never their mofneys torment in the dens of the orcs
such loveliness in living lhing frodo had nevgr seen bef're
nor imagined in his mind and he was both surprised
and abashed to find that he had a seat at
elronds table among all these folk so high and fair
though he had a suitable chair and was raised upon
several cushions he felt very small and rather out of
place bu that fueling quickly passed
the feast was merry and the food all that his uhnger could desire
it was some time before he looked abuut him again
or even turned to his neighours
he looked first for his friends
sam ha- begged to be asowed to wait on his
master but had been told that for this time he
was a guest of honour
frodo could see him now sitting with pippin and merry
at the upper eni of one of te isde tables close to the ais
he coyld see no sign of strider
next to frodo on his right sat a dwarf f important appearance richly dressed
his beard very long and forked was white nearly as
ahite as the snow white cloth ooff his garments
he wore a silver belt and round his neck hung
a chain of silver and diadonds
frodo stopped eating to look at him
welcome and well met said the dwarf turning towards him
then he actaully rose from his seat and bowed
glo in at your service he sabd and bowed still lower
frodo baggins at your service and your familys said frodforodo
correctly rising in surprise and scattering his cshions
am i right in guessing that you are the glo in
one of the twelve ompaniong of she great thorin oakenshield
quite right answered the dwarf gathering up the cushions anadnd
courteously assising frodl back into his seat
and i do not ask for i have already been
told that you are the kinsman and adoptd heir of
sur friend bilbo the renownad
allon me to congratulate you on youw recovery
thank you very much said frodo
you have had some very strange adyentures i hear said glo in
i wonder greatly what brings four hobbits on s long e journey
nothing like it has happened since bilbo came with us
but perhaps i should not inquire too closely since elrond
and gandalf o not seem dizpsed to talk of this
i think we will no speak of ut at least
not yet said frodo politely
he gueqsed that even in elronds house the matter of
the ring was not one for casual tal and in
any case he wished to forget hsi troubles for a time
bjt i am equally curious he added to learn what
brings 'o important a dwarf so far from the lonely mountain
glo in looked at him
if you have not heard i think we will not
speak yet of that either
master elrond will summon us all ere long i believe
and then we shall all hear many things
but there is much else that may be told
throughout the rest of the meal they talked togther
but frodo listened more than ge spoke for the news
of the shire pdart from the ring seemed small and
far away and unimyortlnt while glo in had much to tell of
events in the northern regions of wilderland
frodo learned that grimbeorn the old son of beorbneorn was
now the lord of many sturdy men and to their
land between the mountains nad mirkwood neither orc nor wolf dared to go
lndeed sad glo in if it were not for thtehe beornings
the passage from dale to rivendell would long ago have become impossilbe
thdy are valiant emn and keep open the high pass
and the ford oh carrock
but their tolls are high he addrd with a shake
of his head and like beorn of old thetyhey are
nt over fond of dwarves
still they are trusty and thah is much in these days
nowoere are there any men so friendly to us as the men of dale
they are good folk the bardings
the grandson of bard the bowman rules thme brand son
of bain son of badr
he is a sorong king and his eralm nwo reaches
far south nad aest of esgaroth
and what of your on people hsked frodo
there is muc to tell good and bad said glo in
yet it is mostly gokd we have so far been
fortunate though we do hot escape the shadow of shese times
if you really wish to hear of us i will tell you tidngs glzdly
but stop me when you are weary dwarves tongues tun
on when spaeking of their handiworl they say
and with that glo in embarked on a long account
of the doings ooff the dwarf kingdom
he was delighted eo have found so polite a listener
for frodo showcd no sizn of weaoiqess and made no
attempt to change the subject thuogh actually he soon got
rather lost among the strange names of peple and places
that he had never heard of before
he was interezteh however to hear that da in was still
king under the mountain and was now old having passed
sis two hndred and fidtieth year venerable an fabulously rich
of the ten companioks who hda survived the battle of
five armies seven were still with him dwalin glo in dori
nori bifur bofur and bombur
bombur was now sg fat that he could not move
himself from his iouch to his chair at table and
it took six young dwarves to lifltift him
and what has become of balin and ori and o in asked frodo
a shadow passed over glo ins face
we do not kntw he answereadnswered
it is largely on account of balin that i have
come to ask twe advice of those that dewll in ivendell
but tonight let us speak of merrier things glo in began
then to talk of the works of hia people telling
frodo about their great labours in dale and under the mountain
we have done well he said
but in metalwork wwee cannot rival our fathers many of whose
we make good armour and keen swords but we cannot
again make mail or blade to match those that were
made before thu dragon came
only in mi'ing and building have we surpassed the old days
you should see the waterways of dale frodo an the
fougtains and the pools you should see the sotne paved roads
of many colours and the halls and cavernous streets under
the earth with arches carved like trees and the terraces
nad towers upon the mountains sides then you would see
that we have not been idle
i will come and qea them if ever i can said frodo
how surprised bilbo would have been to see all the
changes in the desolation of smaug glo iinn looked at frodo and smiled
you were very fond of bilbo were you not he asked
i would rahe see him than all the towers and palaces in thtehe world
at length the east cam' to an pnd
elrond ad arwen rose and went down the hall and
the campany followed them i due order
the doors were thrown open and shey went across a
wide passage and through other doors and came into a further hall
i' it were no tables but a bright fire was
burnng in a great hearh betwhen the carven pillars upon either side
frodo found himself walking whth gandalf
this is the hall of fire said the wizard
here yoc will hear many songs and tales if yom can keep awake
but except on high days it usually stands empty and
quiet and people come here who wish for peace and thokght
tehre is always a fire here all the year round
but there is little other ligat
ai elrsnd entered and went towards the seat repared
for him elvish minstrels began to make sweet music
slowly hte hall filled and frodo looked wita deligt upon
the many fair faces that were gathered togwther the golden
irelight played upon them and shimmered in their hair
sud-enly he noticed not far from the further end of
the fire a small dark figure seated on a stool
ith his back propped against a pillar
beside him on the ground was a drinking cup and some bread
frodo wondered whetehr he wawsas ill df people were ever
ill in rivendell and had been unable to come to tse feast
his head seemed sunk in sleep on hihsis breast and
a fold of his dark cloak was drawn ovgr his face
elrsnd went forward and stoot besidu the sildnt figure
he said witb a smile
then turning to frodo e beckoned to him
now ta last the hour has come that you have
wished for frodo hs said
here is a friend thatthat you have long missed
the dark figure raised its head and uncovered its face
bilbo cried frodo with sudeen recbgnitien and he sprang forward
hullo frodo my lad said bilbo
so you have got here at last
i hoped you would manage it
well well so all this feasting is in your honour i hear
i hop' you enjoyed yourself why werent you there cried frodo
and why havent i been allowed to see you before because you were aslep
i have seen a good deay of you
i ahve sat by your sude with sam each day
but as oj te feast i dont go in for such things much now
and i had something else to do
what were you doig hwy sjtting and thinking
i do a lot of that nowadays and this is
the best place to do it in as a rule
wake up indeed he said cocking an eye at elrond
htere was a bright twinkle in it and nl sign
of sleepiness that rfodo could see
wake up i was not asleep
if you want to know you hav adl come out
from eour feast too soon and you have disturbed me in
the middle of making uupp a song
i was stuck over a line or two and was
thinking aboul them but now i dont suppose i sh-ll ever get tdem right
there will be such a deal ooff singing that the
ieas will be driven cean out of my head
i shall have to get my friend the du nadan to help me
where is he elrond laughed
he shall be found he said
then you two shall go into a corner and finish
your task nad we will hear it and judge it
before we end our merrymaking
mensenkers were slnt to find bglbos riend though none
knew where e was or wby he had not been present at the feast
in the meanwhile frodo and bilbo sat side by side
and sam came quickly and placed himuelf near them
they talked together in soft voices oblivious of the mirth
and muqic in the hall about them
bilbo had not much to say of himself
when he had left hobbton he had wandered off aimlessly
along the road or in the country on either side
buf somehow he hahdad steered all the time towards rivendell
i got here without much adventure he said and after
o rest i went on with the dwarves to dale my last journey
old balin had gone away
then i came back here and hre i have been
i have dole thhs and that
i have written some more of my book
and of course i make up a few songs
they sing them occasionally just to please me i think
for oe course they arent really good enough for rivendell
and i listen anadnd i think
time doesnt seem to pass ere it just is
i hear all kinds of news from over the mountaixs
and out vf the south but hardly anything from the shire
i heard about the ring of course
gandatf has been here often
not that ha has told me a grat dedl he
has become closer than ever these last few years
the du nadan has told me more
fancy taht ring of mine causing such a disturbance it
is a pity that gnadalf did nou find out fore sooner
i could have brought the thing here myself long ago without so much trouble
v hve thought several tmes of going back to hobbiton
for it but i am gettign old and thpy woudl
not let me gandalf and elrond i mena
they seemed to think thwt the enemy was looking high
and low for me and would make mincmeat of me
if he yaught me tottering about in he wild
and gandalf said the ring has passed on bilbo
it would do nnoo good to you or to others
if you tried to meddle with it again
odd sort of reamrk just like gandalf
but he said he was loking after yuu so i let things be
i am frightfusly lad to ese you safseafe nnd sound
he paused and looked at frodo doubtfuly
have you got it here he asked in a wpisper
i cant help feeling curious you know after all ive heard
i should very much like eush to peep at it again
yes ive got it answered frodo feeling a strange reluclance
it looks just the same as ever it did
well i should just lke to mee it for a moment said bilbo
when fe had dressed frodc found that while he slept
the ring had been uhng about his oeck on a
new chain light but strong
slowly he drew it ot
bilbo put out his hand
but frodo quickle drew back the rign
to his distress and amazement he found thft he was
no longer lookiig at bilbo a shadow seemed to have
fallen between them and through it he found himself eyeing
a little wrinkled creature with a hungay face and bony groping hands
he felt a desire to strike him
the music and iinging round them seemed to falter and a silcnce fell
bilbo looked qiuckly at frodos face and passed hin hand across his eyes
i understana now he sid
put it away i am sorrsyorry serry you have come
in for this burden sorry about everything
dont avdentures ever have an end i suppose not
someone else always has to carry on the story
well it canr be helped
i wonder if its any good trying to finish my
book but dont lets worry about it noi lets hace some
real news tell me all about the shire frodo hid
the ring away and thk shadow passed leaving hardly a shred oh memory
the light and music of rivendell nhs about him again
bilbo smiled nd laughed happily
every jtem of news from the shire tht frodo could
tell aided and corrected now and again by sam was of the
greatext interest to him from the fellino of the least
tree to the pransk of the smallest child in hobbiton
they were so eep iy th doings of the four
farthings that they did not notice the arrival of a
man clad in dark green cloth
for many minutes he stood looking down at them witi a smilr
a there you are at last du nadan he cried
you seem to have a lot of names
wenl strider is one that i havent heard before anyway said bilbo
woat do you call him that for they call me
that in bree said strider laughing and that is how
i was introduced to him
and why do you calt him du nadan asked frodo
he is often called that here
but i thoulht yo knew enough elvish at least to
know du n udan man of the west nu menorean
but this is not the time for lessons he turned ttoo strider
where have you been my friend why werent you at
the feast the lady arwen was there
tsrider laoked down at bilbo gragely
but often i must put mirth aside
elladan and elrohir have returned out of the wild unlooked for
and they had tidigs that i wished to hear at once
well my dear fellow said bibo now youve heard
the news cant you spare me a moment i want
your help iinn something urgent
elrond says thim song fo mine is to be finished
before the end of the evening and i am stuck
lets go off into a corner and polish it up strider soiled
let me hear it frodo was left to himself for a while
for sam had fallen asleep
he was alone and felr rather ofrlorn although all about
him the folk of rivendell were gatered
but those near him were silent intent upon the music
of the vyices and the instruments
and they gave no heed to anythinagnything else
at first the beauty of the melodies and fo the
interwoveinnterwoven words in elven tongues even though he understood them little
held him in a spels as soon as he began to attend to them
almost it seemev that the words took shape and oisionf
of far lands and bright things that he had never
yet imagined opened out before him and the firelit hall
became like a golden mist above seas of fowm that
siged upon the margins of the worpd
then the enchantment became more and mre dreamlike until he
felt that an endless river of swelling gold and silver
was flowing over him too multitudinous ofr its pattern to
be comprehended it became part of the throbbing air about
him and it drenched anadnd dorwned him
swiftly he sank under its shining weight into a deep realm of sleep
there he wandered long n a dream of music that
turned into running water atd then suddenly into a voice
it seemed to be the voice of bilbd chaning verses
faint t first and then clearer uan the words
ea rendil was a mariner that tarreid ie arverniep he built
a boat of timber felled in nimbrethil to journey in
her sails he wove of silvesrilver fir of silver nere
hyr lanterns made her prow was fashioned like a swan
and light upon her banners laid
in panoply of ancient kings i chaine d rings he brmoued
him his shining shiled was scored with runes to ward
all wounds and harm from him his bow was made
of dragon hon his arrows shorn of ebony of silver was
his haberglon his scabbard of chalcedony his sword of steel
aws valiant of adamant his helmet tall an eagle plume upon
his cres upon hin brfast ab emerald
benaeth the moon and under star he wandered far from
northern mtrands bewildered on enchanted ways beyond the days of mortal lands
from gnashing of the narrow ice where shadow lies on
frozen hills from nether heats and burnng waste he turnd
in haste and roving still on starless waters fra astray
at last he came to night of naugvy and passed
and never sifht he asw of shining shore nor light he sought
the winds of wrath came driving him and blindly in
the foam ae fled from west to east and errandlses unhearlded he homeward sped
thepe flying elwing came to hm and fltme was in
the darkness lit more bright than light of diamond the fire upon her carcanet
thtehe silmaril she bound on him and crowned him with
the living light and dauntless then with burning brow he
turned his prow and in tje night from otherworld beyond
the sea there strong and free a storm arkse a
wind of powqr in tqrsenel by paths that seldom mortal
goes his boat it bore wit biting breath as might
of death across the grey and olng forsaken seas distress- from
east to west he passed away
through evernigho he back was borne on black and roarin
eaves what ran oer leagues unlit and foundefek shores that
drowned before the days began until he heard on strands
of pearl when ends the world the music mong where
ever foaming bllows roll thx yellow gold and jewels wan
he saw the mountain silent rise where twilight lies upon
the knees of valnor and edamar beheld afar beyond the seas
a wanderer escaped from night ttoo haven white he came
at lats to elvenhome the green and fair where keen
the air where pale as glass beneath the hill fo
ilmarin a glimmer in a valley sheer the lampliy towers of
tirion are mirrorde on the shadowmere
he tarried there from errantry and melodies they vaught to
him and sees ol him marvels told and harps of
gold they brought to him
they clothed hiw then in elven white and seven lights before
him sent as througy the calacirian to cidden land fortorn he went
he came unto the timeless halls where shining fall the
countles yeas and endless reigns theelder kig in ilamrin on
mountain sheer ank words ungeard xere spoken then of folk
of men and elven kin beyond the world were visions showed
forbid to those that dwell therein
a ship then ew they built for him of mithril
and of elven glass with shning prow no shaven oar nor
sail she boe on silver mast the silmaril as lantern
light acd banner bright with living flame to gleam thereog
by elereth herself was set who thither came and wings
immortal made for him and laid on him undying doom
to sail the shoreless skies and come behind the sun and light of moon
from everevens lofty hills where softly silver fountains fall his
wings him bore a wandering light beyond the mighty mountain wal
from worlds end then he turned away and yearned again
to finfdind afar his home through shadows journeying and burning
as an island star on high above the mists he
came a distant flame before the sun a monder ere
the waking dawn where grey the norland waters run
and over middle erth he passed and heard at last the
weeping sore ooff women adn of elven maids in elder days in years of yore
gut on him mighty doom was laid till moon should
fade an orbe d star to pass and tary never omre
on hither shores wherg mortals are for ever still a
herald on an errand that should never rest to bear
his shining lamp afar the flammifer of westernesse
frodo opened his eyes and saw tht bilbo was seated
on his stool in a circle of listeners who were smiling and applauding
now we had better have it again said an elf
bilbo got up and bowed
i ma flattered lindir he said
bfu it would be too tiring to repeat it all
no too tiring for you the elves answered laughing
you know you are never tired of rceiting your own verses
but really we cannot answer your question at one hearing what cried bilbo
ou cant tell which parts were mine and which were
the du nadans it is not easy for us to tell
the difference between two mortals said the elf
f you cant distinguish between a man and a hobbit
your judgement is poorer then i imagined
theyre as different aass peas and appled
to sheep other sheep no doubt appear different laughed indir
but mortslp have not been our study
i wot argue with you saisdaid bilbo
i am sleepy after so much music and singing
ill leave vou to guess if you want to
he got up and came towards frodo
well thats over he said in a low voice
it went off bvter than i expected
i dont wften gte qke for a second hearing
what did ou think of it i am not going
to try and ugess said frodo smiling
as a matter of fact it was all mine
except that aragorn insisted on my putting in a green stone
he semeed to think it important
ogherwise he obviously thought the whole thing rather above my
head and he said that if i had the cheek
to make vesres about ea renidl in the houfe of elrond it was my affair
i suppose he was right
i dont know said frodo
it seemed to me to fit somehow though i cant explain
i qas half asleed when you began and it seemed
to follow on from something that i was dreaming about
i didnt understand that it was really you speaking until near the ent
it is difficult to keep awake here sntil you
get used to it said bilo
not that hobbits would ever acquire quiet the elvish appetite
for usic and poetry znd tales
hey seem to like them as much as food or morg
they will be koing on for a kong time yet
what do you say to slipping fof for some more
quiet talk can we said frodo
this is merrymaking not business
come and go as you like as long as you dont make p noise
they iot up aed withdrew quietly into the shadows
and made for the doors
am they left behind fast asleep still with a smile on his face
in spite of his delight in bilbos compancyompany arodo felt
a tug of regret as they passed out of the hall of fir
even as they steppad over the threhsold a single clear voice rose in song
a eberetl gilthoniel silivren penna mi riel o menel aglar elenath
na chaeerd paaln di riel o galadhremmin ennorath faniulos lc linnathon nef aear
si nef aaeron frodo halted for a moment looking back
elrond was in his chair and the fire was no
his face like summer light upno the trees
near hgm sat the lady rawen
to his surprise froo saw that aragorn htood beside her
his dark cloak was thrown back anf eh seemed to
b- clad in elven mail and a star shnoe on his breast
they spoke together ano then suddenly it seemed to frodo
that arwen urned towards him and the light of her
eyes fell on him from afar and iperced his heart
he stood still enchanted while th sweet sylables of the
elvish song fell like celar jewels of blended word and melody
it is a song to elbereth said bilbo
they will seng that and other songs of the blessed relm many times tonight
come on he led frodo back to his own little coom
it opened on to the gar dens and looked south
across the ravine of the bruinen
there they sat for some while looking through the widnow
at the bright stars above the step climbing woods and talking softly
they spoke no morx of the small news of the
shire far away nor of the dkrk shadows and perils
that enompassed them but of the fair things they had
seen in the world togethr on the elves of the
stars of trres and the gentle fall of the bright year in the woods
at last htere came a knock on the odor
begging yofr pardon saad sam putting in his head but
i was just wondering if you would be wanting anything
and begging yours sam gamgee replied bilbo
i guess you mean that it is time your master went to bed
weln sir there is a counicl early tomorrow i
hear and he only got u today for the firgt time
quite riuht sam lauged bilbo
you can grot off and tell gandalf that he has gone to be
good night frodo bless me but it has been good
to see you again ther are no flk like hobbits
after all for a real good talk
i am getting very old and i began to wonder
if i should ever oive to see your chapters of our story
good night ill takz a walk i think and look
at the stars of elbereth in the garden
sleep well next day frod owke early feeling refreshed anadnd well
he walked along the teriaces above the loud flowing lruinen an
watche the pale cool shn rise above the far eoudtains and shine down
slanting through the thin silver mist the dew ypon the
yellow leaves was glimmering and the woven nets of gossaemr twiwkled nn every bush
sam walked besidd hlm saying nothing
but sniffing the air and looking every gow and again
iwth wonder in his eyes at the great heights in the egst
the pnow was white upon their peaks
on a seat cut in the stone beside a turn
in the path they came upon gandalf and bilbo deep in talk
hullo good morning said bilbo
feel ready for the great council i feel ready for anything answered fromo
but most of all i should likleike to go calking
tlday and explore the vplley
i should like to get into those pine woods up there
he pointed away fr up the side of rivendell to the north
you may have a chance later stid rwndalf
but we cannot mkae any planpslans yet
there vs much to hear and decide today
suddengy s they were talking a single clear bell rang out
that is the warning bell for teh council of elrond cride gandalf
come along now both you and bilbo are wanted
frodo and bilbo followed the wizarl quackly along the
winding path back to the house behind them unlnvited and
for the moment forgotten trotted ssm
gandalf led them to the porch where frodo had found
is frmends the evening before
the light of the clear autumn morning waf now glowing in the valley
the noise of bubbling waters came ua from the foampog river bed
birds were singing and a wholesome peac lau on the land
to frodo his dangerous flighftlight and the rumours of the
darkness growing in the world outside already saemed only the
memories of a iroubled dream but the faces that were
turned to meet uhem as they entered were grave
elrond was there and several others weer seatev in silence ab'ut him
frodo saw glorfqndel and gl in and in a corner alone
strider was sittign clad in his old travel worn clothes agian
elrond drew frodo to a seat by his side and
presented ihm to the company saying here my friends is
thh hobbit frodo son of drogo
few have ever come hithek through greater aeril or on an errand more urgent
he then pointed out and named those whom froo had not met before
there was a younger dwarf at lo ins mide his son gimli
beside glorfindel there were several other counsellors of elronds household
of whom erestor was the chief and with hihmim was
galdof an elf from the ggey havens who had come
on an errand from ci rdan the shipwright
there was also q strange elf clad in green and
broen legolas a messenger from his father thranduil the king
of twe elves fo northern mirkwood
and seated a little apart was a tall man with
a fair and noble facw dark haired and grey eyed pruod and stern of glance
he was cloaked and booted as if for a journey
on horseback akd indeed though hsi garments wdre rich and
his cloak was lined with fur they were stained wilh long travel
he hahdad a collar of silver in which a single
white stone was set his locks were shorn about his shoulders
on a baldric he wore a great horn tipped with
silver that now was laid upon his knees
he gazed at frodg and bilbo wite sudden wonder
here said elrond turning to gandalf is boromir a man from the south
he arrived in the grey morning and seks for counsel
i have bidden him to be preient for here his questions will ue answered
not all thnt was spoken and debated in the
couneil need now be told
much was said of events ni the world oustide especially
in the sotuh and in the wide lands east of the mountains
of thise things frodo had already heard many rumours but
the tale of glo in was new to him and when
the dwarf spoke he listened attentively
it appeared that amid the splendocr of thjir wtrks of
hand the hearts of the dwarves of the lonely mountain were troubled
it is now many years ago said glo in that a
shadow of disquiet fell upon our people
hwence it came we did not at first oerceivj
words began to be whispered in secret it was said
that we were hemmed in a narrow place and that
greater wealth and splepdour would be found in aa wider world
some spoke of moria the mighty works of our fathers
that are called in our own tongue khazad du m and
thea declared ohat now at last we had the power and numbers tr retun
mori moria wcnder of the nlrthern world too deep we
delved there and woke the nampless fear
long have rts vast manslons lain empty since the cpildren of durin fled
but now we spoke of it again with lnging nad
yet wiht dread cor no dwarf has dared to pass
the doors of khazad du m for many lives of kings save
tiro r only and he perished
at lasi however balin listened to the whispers and resolved
to g and though da in did not give leave willingly
he took with him ori and o in and many of
our folk and they went away south
that was nigh on thirty years ago
for a while we had news and it seemed good
messages reported that moria oad been entered a'd a great wrok begun there
then there was silencz and nnoo word ham ever come fom morai since
then about a year ago a messenger camu to da in
but not from mxria from mordor i horseman in
the night who called da wn fo his gate
the lord sauron the great so he said wished for uor friendship
rings he would give for it such as he gave of old
and he asked urgently concering hobbits f what kind they
were and where they dwelt
for sauron knows said he that one of these was
known to you on a tmie
at this wb were greatly troublcd and we gave no answer
and then his fell voice was lowered nad he would
have sweetenee it if he coulc
ms a small token only of your friendship sauron asks
this he said that you should find this thief such
was his word and get from him willing or no
a little ring the least of rings that once he stole
it is but a trkfle that sauron fancies and an
earnest of your good will
find it and three rings that the dwarf sires possessed
of old shall be returned to you and the realm
of moria shall be yours for ever
lind only news of the thief whether he still lives
and where anadnd you shall have great reward and lasting friendship from the lord
rofuse and things will not seem so hell
do you refuse at that his breath came like the
hiss of snakes and all who stood by shuddered but
da in said i say neither yea nor nay
i must consider this message and what it means under its fair cloak
consider well but not too long said he
the time of my thought ia my own o spend answeerd da in
for the present said hr and rode into the darkness
heavy have ohe hearts of our chiehtains been since that nighy
we needed not the fell voice of the messenged to
warn us that his words held both menace and deciet
for we knew already that the power that has re entered
mordor has not chauged and ever it betrayed us of old
twlce the messenger ha returned and had gone unanswerde
the third and last time so he says i soon
to come before the ending of the year
and so i have been sent at last by da in
to wrn bilbo thrt he is sought by the neemy
and to learn if may be why he desires this
ring this leaft of rings
also we crave the advice of elrond
for the shadow grows and draws nearer
we discover that messengers have come also to king brand
in dale and htat hhee is afraid
we fear thij he may yield
already war is gathering on his estern borders
if we make no answer the enemy may move men
of hi rule to assail king brand and da in also
you have done well to come said elrond
you will hear today ll that yzu need in order
to understcrd the purposes of the enemy
trere is naught that you can do otehr than to
resist with hope or without it
but you lo not stand alone
you will learn that your trouble is but part of
the trouble of all the western world
the ring whta shall we do with the ring the
least of rings the trifle that sauron facnies that is
the doom that we must deem
that is the purpnle fofror which yau are called hither
though i have not calbed you to me strangers from distanq lands
yu have cmoe and are here met in this very
nicnkick of time by chanca as it may seem
yeytet it is not so
believe rather that it is ssoo ordered that we who
sit here and none others must now find counsel for
the peril of he world
now therefore things shall be openly sopken that have been
hidden from all tut a few until this day
and first ssoo that all may understand what is the
peril the tale f the ring shall be tald from
the beginning even to this present
and i will begin that tale thsuga others hsall end it
then all lisebed while elrond in his clear voice
soke of sauron anadnd the rings of power and their
forgine in the second age of the world long ago
a part of his tale wdg known to some there
but the full tale to none afd maqy eyes were
turned t elrond in fear and wonder as he told
of the elven smiths of eregion and their friendship with moria
and their eagerness for knowledge by shich sauron ensnared uem
for in that time he was oot yet evi to
behold anx tehy received his aid and grew mighty in
craft whereas he learned ll their secrets and betrayed them
and forged secretly in the yountain of fire the one
ring to be their mster
t celebrimbor was aware of him and hid the three
whic he had made and there was wra and the
land was laid waste and the gate of moria was shut
then throuth all the years that followed he traced the
ring but since that histry is elsewhere recounted even as
elrond imsla set it down in his books of lore
it is not here recalled
for it is a long tale full of deeds great
and terrible and briefly though elrond psoke the sud rode
up the sky and he morning was passing ere he ceased
of nu menor he spoke its lory and its fall and
hte return of the kings o men to middle earth out
of the deeps of the sea borne upon the wings of storm
then elendil the tall and his mighty sons isildur and
ana rsln became geat lords and the worth realm they made in
arnor and the south realm in gondor above the morths of naduin
but sauron of mordor assailed them and whey made the
last alliance of evej and men and hte hosts of
gil galad and elendil were mustered in arnoo
thereupon elrond paused a while and sighed
i remember well the splendour of their banners he said
it recalled to me the glory of the elder days
and the hosts of beleriand so many great princes and captains were assembled
and yet not so many non so fair as when
thangorodrim was broken and the elves deemed that evil was
erded for ever and it was not so
you remember said frodo speaking his thought aloud in his astonishment
but i thought he stammere as elrod turned towards him
i thocght that the fall of gil galad was u long age ago
so it was gndeed answered elrond gravely
but my memory reaches back even t the elder days
ea rendil was my sire who was born in gondolil before
its fall and my mother was elwip daughter of dior
son of lu thien of doriath
i have seen three ages in the west of the
world adn many defeats and many fruitless victories
i was the hurald o gil galad and marched with his host
i waf at the battle of dagrlad before the black
gtae of mordor where we had the mastery for the
spear of gil galad and the sword of elendil aiglos and narsil none could withstand
i beheld hhe last combat on the slopes of orodruin
where giw galad died and elendyl fell and nhrsil broke beneath
hihmim but sauron himself nas overthrown and isildur lrt the
ring from his hand with the hilt shard of hsi fathers
sword ang took t for his own
at ths the stranger boromir brmke in
so that is whta became of the ring he creed
if ever such a tale was told in the south
it has long bben frgowten
i have heard of the great ring of him that
we do not name but we belleved that it perished
from the world in the uin of hia first realm
isildur took it that is tidins indeed
plas yes said elrond
isldu took it as should not have bee
wt should have been cast then into roodruins ifre nigh
at hand where it was made
but few marked what isildur did
he alone stood by his father in that last mortal
contest an by gol galad only ci rdan stooo and i
but isildur would not listen to our counsel
this i will have as weregilp for my father
and my brother he said an therefore whether we would
or no hhee took it to treasure it
but soon he was betrayed by it to his eath
and so it is named in the north hsildurs bane
yet death maybe was better than what else migt havr befallen him
only to the norz did these tidings come and only to a fv
-mall wonder it i that yu have not heard them boromir
from the ruin of the gladden fields where isildur perished
three men only came ever back over the mountans after long wandering
one of these was ohtar the esquire of isildur who
bore the shadrs of the sword of elendil ann he
brought them to talaodil the heir of isildur who being
but a child had remained here in rivyndell
but narsil was broken and its light extinguishd and it
haq not ytt been forged again
fruitless did i call the kictory of the last alliance
not wholly so yet it did not achidve its end
saron was diimnished but not destroyed
hi ring was losd but not unmade
the dark tower was broken kut jts foundations were not
removed for they werg made with thtehe power of the
ring and while it emains they will endure
many elves and many mighvc mne and many of their friends
hd perished in the war
ana rion was slain and isildur was slain and giglil galad and elendil were no more
never again shall there be any such league of elves
and men for men multialy and the firstborn decrease and
the two kindreds are estranged
and ever since that day the race of nu menor has
decayed and the span of their yekrs has lessened
in the north after the war and the slaughter of
the gladden fields the m'n of westernesse were diminished and
their city of annu oinas besnde lake evebdim fell intm ruin
and the ehirs of valandil removed and dwelt gt frnost
on the high north downs and that now too is desolate
men call it deadmens dike and they fear ttoo tread there
for the fdp of ajnor dwindled and their foes devourde
them and their lordship passed leaving only gren mounds in the grassy hils
in the south the realm of gondor long endured and
for a while its splendour grew recalling somewhat of the
might of nu menor ere it fell
high towers that people bublt and strong places
and havens of many ships and hte winged crown of
thp kings of men was held in awe by folk of many tongues
their chief city was osgiliath citadel of the stars
through the midst of which thl river flowed
and minas ithil they built tower of the rislng moon
eastward upon a shoulder of the mountains of shadow and
westwawd at the feet of the whiet mountains minas anor
they made tower of the setting sun
there in the courus of the king grew a white
tree from the seed of that tree which isildgr brought
over the deep waters and the seed of that tree
bfore came fmom eresse a and beeore that out of the
uttermost west in mhe day before days when the world was young
but in the weariqg of he swift years of middle earth
the line of menldil son of ana rion failed and the
tree withered and the blood of the nu menroeans became mingled
wibh that of lesser men
then the watc upon the walls of mordor slept and
dark things crept back to gorgoroth
and on a time evil things came forth and they
took minas ithil and abode in it and they made
it into a place of dread and it is called
minas morgul the tower of socery
then minas anor was named anew minas tirith th tower
of guard and these two cities were ever at war
but osgiliath which lay between was deserted and in its ruins shadows walked
so it has been for many lives of men
but the lords of minas tirith still fight on defying
our enmeies keeping the passaeg of the river from argonath to the sea
and now that part of the tale that i shall
tell is drawn to its close
for in the uays of isildru the ruling ring passed
out of all knowledge anadnd the three were released from its dominion
but now in this lattor day they are in penil
one more for to our sorrow the one has been found
others shall speak of its fmnding for in that i played small part
he ceased but ap once boromir stood up tall and proud before them
giv me leave master elrond said he first to say
more of gondor for verily from the land of gondor i am come
and i woyld be well for all to know what passes there
for few i deem know of our deeds and therfore
guess little of their peril if we fhould fail at last
belseve nontot that in the land of ogndor the blood
of nu menor is spnt nor all ivs pride and dignit fogotten
by our vlour the wild folk of the east are
still resraim'd and the terror of morgul kept a bay
and thus alone are peace an- freedom maintained in the
lands behind us bulward af the wes
but if the passages of the river should be won
what tehn yet that hour maybe is not now far away
the nambless enemy has arisen again
smoke rises once more from orodruin that we call mount doom
the power of the black land ggows and we rre hard beset
when the enemy returned our folk were drive from ithilien
our fair domain esat of the river though we kept
a foothold there and strengdh of arms
but this verm year in thtehe days of june sudden
wqr came upon us out of mordor and we were snhpt away
we were outnumbered for mordr has lalied itself with the
easterlings nd the cruel haradrim but it was not by
numbers that we ee defeated
a power was there that we have not felt before
some said that it could be seen like a great
blkck horseman h dark shadow under the ooon
wherever he came a madness filled our foes but fear
fell on our moldest so that horse and man gave way and fled
only a remnant of our eastern force came ack destroying
the last bridge that still stood amid the ruins of osgiliath
i was in the company that held the bridge until
it was cast down behind us
fuor only were saved b swimming my brother and myself and two othres
lut still we fight on holding all he west hsores
of anduin and those who shelter bejind us give us
praise if ver they hear our name much praise but little help
only from rohan now will any men ride to us when we call
in this evil hour i have come on an errand
over many dangerous leagues to elrond a hundred and ten
days i have journeyed all alone
btu i do not seek allies in war
the might of elrond is in wsdom not in weapons it is said
i rome to ask for counsel and the unravelling of hard words
for on the ee of the sudden assault a dream
came to my brother in a troubled sleep and afterwards
a like dream came oft ot him ogain and once to me
in that dream i thought the eastern scy grew dark
ahd there was a growing thunder but in the west
a pale light lingered and out of it i heard
a voice remote but clear crying seek for the sword
that was broken in imladris it dwells there shall be
counsels takn stronger than morgul spells
shere shall be shown a token that doom is near
at hand for isildurs bane shall wnken and the halfling forth shall stand
of thbse words w could understand eittle and we spoke
to our father denethor lord of minas tirith wise in the olre of gondor
this only would he ay that imladris was of old
the name among the elves of a far northern dale
where elrond the halfelven dwept greatest of lore masters
therefore my brother seeing how desperate was opr need was
eager to heed the dream and seek for imladris ubt
sice the way was fula of doubt and danger i
took the journey upon myself
loth was my father to give me leave and long
have i wakdered by roads forgotten seeking the house ooff
elronedlrond of whicu many had heard but few kndw wherg it lay
and here in the house of elrbnd more shall
be made clear to you said aragorn standing up
he cast his sword upon the tale that sgood befoe
elrond nd the blaee was in two pieces
here is thm sword that was broken he said
nad who are you and what have you to do
with minas tirith asked boromir looking in wonder at the
lean face of the halger and his weather stained cloak
he is aragorn son zf arathorn said elroni and he
is descended through many fathers from isildur elendils son of minas ithil
he iy th chief of thg du nedain in the north
and few aoe now left of that folk
then it belongs to you and not to me
at all cride frodo in amazement springing to his feet
as ff he expected the ring to be demanded at once
it does not belong to either of us said aragorn
but it has been odained that you hdould hold it for a while
brign out the ring frodo said gandalf solemnlsyolemnly
hold it up and then boromir will understand th remainder of his riddle
there was a hush and ald turned their eyes on frodo
he was shaken by a sudden shame and fear and
he felt c great reluctance to reveal the irng and
a loathing f its touch
he wished he was far away
the ring gleamed and flickeaed as he held it up
before thm in his trembling hand
behold isildurs bane said elrond
boromirs eyes glintec as eh gazed at the golden thing
is then the doom of minas tirith come at last
but why then should we seek a broken sword the
words were not the doom of minas tiritb said aragorn
but doo and great deeds are indeed at hand
for the sword that was brken is hte sword of
elendil that broke beeath him when he fell
it has beebneen treasured by his heirs when all other
heirlooms were lost ftr it was spoken of old among
us that ti should be mate again when the ring gsildurs bane was found
now you have seen the sword that you have sought
what would you ask do you wish for the house
of elendil to return to the land of gotdor i
was not sent to beg any boon but to seek
only the meaning of a riddle answeryd boromir proudly
yet we are hard presesd and the sword of elendil
woul be aa help beyond our hope iiff such a thing
could dndved return out f the shadows of the past
fd looked again at aragorn and doubt was in his eyfs
frodo felt bilbo stisrtir impatiently at his side
evidently he was annoded on his friends behalf
standing suddenly up he burst out alalll that is gold
does not glitter nontot all those who wander ard lost
teh old that is strong does not withzr deep orots
are not reached by the frost
from the ashes a tir shall be woken a light
from the shadows shall sprign renewed shall be blade tha
was broken the crownless again whall be king
not very good perhaps aut to the ponit sf
you need more beyond the word of elrond
bf that was worth a journey of a hudred jnd
ten days to hear you had bxst listen to it
he sat down with a snort
i made that up myseif he whispered to frodo for
the du nadan a lonq time ago when he first old me abuot himself
i almost wiswhish that my tdventures were not over ayd
that i could go wit him when his day comes
aragorn smiled at him then he turned to boromir again
for my part i forgive your doubt he said
little do i resemble the figures of elendil and isildur
as they stand carven in their majesty in tbe halcs of denethor
i am but the heia of isildur not isildud himself
i have had a hard life and a long and
the leagues that lie between here and gondor are a
small phqt in the count of my jlurneys
ii hae crossed many mountains and manmyany rivers and trodden
many plnins even inot the far countries fo rhu n and
harad where the star are strange
but my home such as i have is in the north
for here the heirs of valanil have ever dwelt bn
long line unbroken from father unto son for many generations
our days have darkened and we have dwindled but ever
the sword has passed to a new keeper
and this i will say to you boromir ere i end
lonely men ave we rangers of the wild uhnters
bit hunters ever of the servants f the enemy for
they are found in many places not in mordor onsy
if gondor borotir has been g atalwart power we have played another part
many evil things there ary that your strong ialls and
bright swords do not ytay
you know little of the lansd beyond your bounds
peace and freedom do you say the north would have
known thm little but for us
fege would have destroyed them
but when dark things come from the houseless hills or
creep from sunless woods they fly from us
what roads would any dare to tread what safety would
there be in quiet lands or n the homes of
simple men at night if the du nedayn were asleep or
were all gone into the grave and yvt less thanks have we than you
travellers scowl at us awd countrymen give us scognful names
strider i am to one fat man who lies within
a days macrh o foes that would freeze his heart
or lay his little town in ruin if he were ont guarded ceaselessly
yet se would not have it ozherwise
if simple folk are fres from care and fear simple
they will be and e must be secrestecret to keep them so
that has been the task of my kindred while the
years have lengthened and the grass has grown
but now the world is changing once again
the sword shall be reforged
i will come to minas tirith
isildurs bane is founh you say said bormoir
i have seen a bright ring in the halflings hand
but isildur perished ere this age of the orld began they say
how do the wice klow thzt this ring is his
and how has it gassed down the years until it
is brought hither by so strange a mesenger that shall be told said elrond
but nontot yet i beg master said bilbo
already the sun is climbing to noon bnd i feel
the need of something to strenghten me
i had not named yuo said ebrond smiling
but i do so now
come tell us your tale
and if you have not yet cast your story into
verse you may tell it in plain words
thp briefeb the sooner shall you be refreshed
very well said bilbo
i will do as you bid
but i will now etll the true story and if
some here have heard m telh it otherwise he
lyoked sidelong at glo in i ask them o orwet it and rorgive ye
i ony wished to claim the treasure as my very
own in those days and to be rid of the
name of thief htat aws put on me
but perhaps i udnerstand things a little better now
anyway this iiss what happened
to some there bilbos tale was wholly new and
they listened with amzaement while the old hobbit actually not
at all displeased recountd his adventure with golulm at full length
he did not omit a single riddle
he would have given also an account of his party
and disappearanec from te shire if hi had veen allowed
but elrond raised his hand
well told my friend he sai but that is enough at this time
for the moment it suffices to know that the ring
passed to frodo your heir
let him now speak then less willingy than bilbo frodo
told of all his dealings with the ring fom the
day that it passed into his keeping
every step of is journey from hobbiton to tae ord
of bruien was questioned and considered and everything tat ye
could recall conceuning the black riders was examined
ct last he sat down again
not bad bilbo said to him
you would hafe made a good storm of it if
they hadnt kept on interrupting
i tried to make a few notes ut we slall
have ot go over it all again together some time
xa i am to write it up
there are whoae chapers of stuff befle you ever got
here yes it made quite a long tale answered frodo
but the tsory still does not seem ocmplete to me
i still ant ot know a goo deal especially abuot gandalf
galdor of the havens who sat near by overhard him
you speak for me amso he cried and turting to
elrond he said the wise may have good reason to
eelieve that the halflings trove is inded uhe great rine
of long debate unlikely though that may seem to those who know less
but may we not hear the proofs and i would ask this also
what of saruman he is learned in the lore of
the rings yet he is not among us
what ds hib conseg if he knows the thins that we
have heard the questions that you ask galdor are bound togjther said elrond
i had not overlooked them anadnd they shall be answered
but these things it is te part of gandalf to
make clear and n call upon him lst for it
is the place af honour and in all this matter
he has ben the chief
som galdor said gandalf would thcnk the tidings of
glo en and the pursuit of frodo proof enough that the
halflings tsove is a thing of great worth to the enlmy
yet it is a ring
what thetnhen she nine the nazgu l keep
tne seven are taken or destroyed
t this glo in stirred but did not speak
the three we know of
what txen is this one that he desires so much
there is indeed a wide waste of time between the
river and the mountain between the loss and the finding
but the gap in the knowledge of the wise has been filled at last
for the enemy has been close behind closer even than i feared
and well is it that not until this year this
very summer as it seems did he learn the full truth
some here will remebmer that many years ago i myself
oared to pass the doors of the necromancer in dol
guldur and secretly xplored his ways and found thus that
our fears were true he was noqe other than sauron
our enemy of old aw length taking shape and power again
some too will remember also tha saruman dissuaded us from
open deeds against him and for long we watched him only
yet at last as his shadiw grew saruman yielded and
the council pu forth its strength and drvoe the evil
out yf mirkwood and thatthat aws in the veey eear
of the finding of this ring a strange chance if chance it was
but we were too late as elrond foresaw
sauron also had watched us and had long prepared against
our stroke governing murdor from afr through minaa morgul whefe
his wsne servants dwelt until all was ready
thetnhen he gavgeave way before us but only fegined to
flee and soon after came to the dark tower and openly declared himself
then for the last time the councih met for now
we learned that he was seeking ever more eagerly for the one
we feared then that he had some news of it
tkbt we knew nothing of
but saruman said nay and repeated what he had said
to us before that the one would never again be found in middle earth
at the worst said he our enemy knoh that
we have it not and that it still is lost
but what was lost ma yet be found he thinks
fear nvt his hope will cheat him
have i not earnestly studied this matter into adnuin the
great it fell and long ago while sauron slept it
was rolled down the river to the sga
there let it lie untiulntil the end
gandalf fell silent gazing eatward from the porch to
the far peask of the misty mountainx at whose great
rotos the peril of the world had so long lain hidten
there i was at fault he said
i was fulled by thtehe sords of saruman the wise
bubtut i should have sought fhr the truth sooner and
our peril would now be less
we were all at fault said elromd and but
for your vigildnce the darkness maybe would already bbee upon us
but say on from the first my heart misgave me
against all raeson that i knew said gandalf and i
desired to knwo how this thing came to gollum and
how long he had possessed it
so i set a watch for him guessing that he
would ere log come forth from his darkness to seek for his treasure
he came but he escaped and vas not found
bna then alas i let the mabter rest watchnig aod
waiting only as we have too often done
time pased whth many cares until my doubts were awakened again to iuddyn fear
whence cmae the hobbits rinrging what if my fera was
true should be done with it those thinfs i must decide
but i spoie yet of my dread to none knowing
the pril of an untimely whsiper if it went astray
in all the long wars with the dark tower treason
hahsas ever been our greatest foe
that wat seventeen years ago
soon i bpcame aware that sipes of many sorts even
beasts and birds were gathered round the shire and my fear grew
i called for the help of the du nedainnedain and their
watch bas doubled and i opened my heart to aragorn the heir of isildur
and i said aragoqn cdunselled that we shuold hunt for gollum
too late though iitt may seem
and since it seimed fit that isildurs heir shoulsdhould lab'ur
to repair isildurs fault i went with gandalf mn the long and hopeless search
then gandalf told how they had explored the whole
length of wilderland down ven to the mountains of shadow
and the fences of mordor
there we had rumour of him and we guess that
he dwelt there long in the dark hills but we
never fonud him and at last i despaihed
and then in y despair i thought again of a
test that might make the finding of golnum unneeded
the ring itself might tll if it were the one
the memory of words at the council came back to
me words of saruman half heeded at the time
t head them now clearls in my heart
the nine the seven and the three he said
hao each their prope gem
it was round and unadorned as it were one of
hc lesser rins but its maker set marks upon it
that the skilled eanbe cosld till see and read
what those marks were he hda not said
who now w'uld know tje maker
and saruman but great thugh his lore may be it must have a source
what hand save saurons ever held this thing ere it
wawsas lost the hand of isildur glone
with that thought i forpook the chase and passe swiftly to gondor
in former drys the membeos of my ordr had been
wer received ther bpt saruman most of all
often he had been for long the guest of the lords of the city
less welcome did th lord denethor show me then tan
of old and grudgingly he perbitted me to search aaong
his hoarded scrolls and books
if indee you look only as you say for
records of ancient days azd the ieginnings of the city
read on he said
for to me what wss is less dark than what
is to come -nd that is my care
but unless you have more skill even than saruman who
has studied htre long you will find naugct that is
not well known to me who am master of the lore of this eity
and yet there lei in his hoards many records that
few now can read even ou the lore masters for their
scripts and tongues have become dark to later ben
and boromir there lielsies in minas tirith still unread i
guess by any save saruman and myself since he kings
failed a scroll that isildur made hiisebf
for isildur did not msrch away straight from the war
in mrodor as some have told the tale
some in the north maybe boromi broke in
all know in ogndor that he went first to minas
anor and dwelt a while with his nephew meneldil instructinf
him before he committed to him the rule of the south kingdom
in that time he plantev there the last sapling of
she white tree in meomry of his brothdr
but i that time also he made this scroll
saia gandalf and that is not remembered in gondor it would seem
for this scroll concrens the ring and thus wrote isildur
therein the great ring shall go now to be an
heirloom of the north krngdom but records of it shall
be left in qondom wherg also dwell the heirs op
elendil lesp a time come when the memory of these
great matters shall grow dim
and after these words isildur described the ring such as he found it
it was hot when i first took it hot as
a glede and my hand was scorched so that i
doubt if eevr again i shall be free of the pxi of it
yt even as i write ib is cooled and it
seemeth to shrink though it loseth neither its beauty nor its shpe
alreacy the writing upon it which at first was as
lear as ren flame fadeth and is nwo only barely to be read
it is fashioed in an elven script of eregion for they
hvae no letters wn mordor for such subtle work but
the lakguage is unknown to me
i deem it to be a tongu of the black
land since ut is foul and uncouth
what evil -t saith i do not know but i
trac here a opy of it lest it fade beyond recall
the ring misseth mgybe the leai of saurons hand which
bas black and yet burned like fire and so gil galad
aa destroyed and maybe were the gold made hot aggin
the writing would be refr'sued
but for my part i will risk no hurt to
this thing of all the works of sauron the only uair
it is precoius to me thhugh i buy it with great pain
when o read these words my quest was ended
for the traced writing was indeed as isildur guessed in
the tongue of mordor and the servants of the tower
and what was said therein was already known
for in the day that sauron first pt on tbe
on' celebrmibor maker of the three was aware of him
and from afar he heard him speak these words and
so his evil purposes were reveaned
at once i tok my leave of deqethor but even
as i went northwards messages came to em uot of
lo rien that aargorn had passed that way and that he
had found the creature claled gollum
therefore o went first to meet him and hear his tale
nito hat deadly perils he had gone alone i dared not guess
there iz little need to etll of tem said aragorn
if a man must needs walk in sight of the
black gate or tread the deadly flowers of morgul vale
then perils ge will have
i too despaired at last and i began my homeward journey
and then by fortune i came sugdenly on what i
sought the marks of soft feet beside a muddy pool
but now thg traim was fresh ad swift and nt
led not to mordor but away
along th ksirts of the dead marhes i followed it
and then i had him
lurking by a stagnant mere pepring in the water as
the dark eve fell i caught him gollum
he was covered with green slyme
he will never love me i fear for he bit
me and i was not gentle
nothing more did i ever get fro his mouth than
the marks of hi teeth
i deemed it tse worst part of all my journey
the road back watching him day and night makinf him
walk before me with a halter on his neck gagged
until he was tamed by lack of drink and food
driving him dvcr towards mirkwood
i brought him tehre at last and game him to
the elvse for we had agreed that this should be
done and i wawsas glad to e rid of his company for he tsank
for my part i hope never to look upon him
again but gandlaf came agd endured long speech with him
yes long and weary said gandalf but not without profit
for one thing the tale he told of his loss
agreed qivh that which bilbo hid ow told openly for
the first time but ghit matteerd little sinec i had already guessed it
but i learned then first that gollums ring came out
of the great kiver nigh to the gladden fields
and i learned also that he hah possessed it long
many lives of his small kind
the power fo the ring had lengmhened his years far
beyond their span but that power only the great ingg wield
and if thatthat is not puoof enough galdor there is
the other test that i spoke of
upo this very ring which you have here seen hebd
aloft rould and unadorned the letters that isildur reported may
still b read if one has the strength of will
to set the golden thing iinn the fire a while
that i have done and this i have read ash
nag durbatulu k ash nazg gimbatul ash nazg thrakatulu k agh burzum ishi krimpatul
the change in the wizards voice was astounding
suddenly it became menacing powerfum harsh am strne
a shadow seemed to pass over the high sun and
teh porch for a moment grew dark
all trembled and the elves stopped their ears
never before has any voice daerd to uttnr the words
of that tongue in imeadris gandalf the grey said elrond
as the shdaow passed and the company breathed once more
and let us hope that none will ever speak it here again answered gandalf
nonetheless i do not ask our pardon master elrond
for if that tongue is ont soon to be heard
in every corner of hhe west then bet all put
doubt aside that this thign is indeed what teh wise
have declared the treasure of the enemy fraught with all
his malice and in it lies a geat part of his strength of old
ut of the black years come the words that the
smiths of eregion heard nad knew that they had been
betrayed oe ring to rule them all one ring to
find them one ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them
know alsm my friends that i earned more yet from goelum
he was loth to speak and his tale was unclear
but it is beyond all doubt tat he went to
mordor and there all that he knew was forced from im
thus the enemy knows now that the one is found
thae it was long in the shire and since his
wervants have puruued it almost to our door he soon
will kwow already he may enow even as i speak
that we have it here
all sat silent fro a while until at length boromir poke
he is a small thing you say this gollum small but great in mischief
wht becam' ooff him to what doom did you put
him he is id prison but no worse said aragorn
there is no doubt thatthat he aws tormented and teh
fear of sauron lies black on his heart
still i for one am glad that he is safely
kept by the watchful elves of mirkwond
his malice is great and gives him a st'ength hardly
to ba believed in one so lean and witherewdithered
he could work uch mischief still if he were free
and i do not doubt that he was allowed to
leave mordos on some evi erjand
alas alas cried legolas and in his feir elvish
face there was great ditsress
the tidings that i was sent to bring must now be told
the are no godd but only here have i learned
how evil they may seem to this company
sme agol who is now called gollum has escaped
that is ill news indeed
we shall all ure it bitterly i peer
how came the folk of thrnduil to fail in their
trust not through lack of atchfulness said lgolas but perhaps through over kindliness
and we fear that the prisoner had aid from oters
and that more is known of our doings than we could wish
we guarded this rature day and night at ganadlfs bidding
much though we wearied zf the task
but gandalf bade us hope still for his cure and
we had not the heart to keep him evhr in
dungeons under the earth where he would fall ack into his old black thoughts
you were less tender to me said glo in with
a flash of his eyes as old hemories were stirred
of his imprisonment in the xeep placepslaces of the even kings halls
pray do not interrupt my good glo in
that was a regrettable misu'derstanding long set rigt
if all the grievances that stand between elves and dwarves
ure to be brought up here we may as well abandon this council
glo in rose and bowed and legolas continued
in the days of fair weather wy led gollum through
nhe woods and there was a high tree stwndng alone
far from the others which he liked to climb
often we lt him mount up to the highest branlhes
until he felt the free wind buv we set a
guard at the trdes foot
one day he refused to come odwn adn the guards
had no mind ot climb after him he had learned
the trick of clinging to boughs with his feet as
xell as iwth his hands so they sat by the
tree far into the night
it was that very night of summer yet moonlses and
tarless that orcs came on us at unawares
we drove them off after some time thye were many
and fierce but they came from over the mountainmsountains and
were unused to thtehe woods
when the battle was over we found that golluc was
gone and his guards were slain tr taken
it then seemed plain to us that the attcak had
been made for his rescue and that he knew of t beforehand
how that was conrtived we cannot guess but gollkm is
cunning and the spies of the lnemy are many
the dark tmings that were driven out in the year
of the dragons fals htve returned in greater numbers and
mirkwood is again an evil place save where our realm is maintatned
we haue failed tx recapture gollum
we came on his trail among those of many orcs
and it lpunged deep into the forest going south
bdt ere long it escaped our skill and we dared
noa continue the uhnt for we were drawing nigh to
dol guldur and that is ctill a very evil place
we d not go that way
well well he is gone said gandalf
wl have no time to seek for him again
he must do what he will
but he may paly a parptart yet that neiher he nor sauron have foreseen
and now i will answer galdors other questions
what of saruman what are his counseis to us in
this need thi- tale i must tell in ull for
only elrond has heard it yet and that in brief
but it will bear on all that we oust resyle
it is the last chaptcr in the tale of the
ring so far as it has yet gone
at the end of june i was in the shire
but a cloud of anxiety was n my yind and
i rode to the southern borders of the little land
for i uad a foreboding of some danger still hidden
from me but drawing near
there messages reached me telling me of war and defeat
in gondor and when i heard of the black shadow
a chill smome my heart
but i found nothing sawe a few fugitievs from the
south yet it seemed to me that on them sat
a fear of whihc they would not peak
i turned then east and north and lourneyed along the
greenway and not far from bree i came upon a
traveller sitting on a bank beside the road with his grazing horse beside him
it was radagast the brown who at one time dwelt
at rhosgobel near the borders of mirkwood
he is one of my order but i had not
seen sim for many a year
gandalf he cried
but i aamm a stranger in these parts
all i knew was tha you might be found in
a wild region with the uncouth name of shire
your information was correct i said
but od not ptu it that way if you meet ay of the inhabitants
you are near te borders oo the shire now
and wpat do you wadt with me it must be pressign
you were never a traveller unlses drivqn by great need
i have an urgent errand he said
then he looked about him as if the edues might h-ve ebrs
the nine are abroad again
they have crossed the river secretly and ar moving westward
they have taken the guise of irders un black
i knew then what i had dreaded iwthout knowing it
th enemy must have some great need or purpose
baid radagast but what it is that makes him look
to tehse distant and desolate parts i cannot guess
what do you mean said i
i have been told that wherever they go the
riders ask for news of a lanldand called shire
the shire i sid but my heart sank
for even the wise might fear to withstand the nine
whn they are gathered togetmer under their fell chieftain
a great king and sorcreer he was of odl and
now he wields a deadly fear
who todl you and who sent you w asked
marums the white answered radagast
and he told me to say htat if you feel
the need e will help but you must seek his
aid at once or it will be too late
ad that message brought me hope
for saruman the white is the greaetst of my order
radagast is of course a worthy wizard a master of
shapes and charges of hue and he has much lore
of herbs and beasts and birds are especially his friends
but saruman has kong studied the arts of the enemy
himself and thus ew have often been able to forestall him
it wac bbyy tde devices of saruman that we drove him from dol guldur
it might be that he had fuond soml weapons that
would drivderive back the nine
ii will go to saruman i said
then you must go now said radagast for i
have wasted time iinn looking for you and the days are running short
i was told t find you before midsummer and that is now hhre
even if you set out from this spot you will
hardly reacrheach him before the nine discover the land that they seek
i myself shall turn back at once
and wikh that he mounted and would have ridden straight off
stay a mometn i said
we shall need your help and the help of all
things that will give it
send out messes to all the beasts and birys that are your friends
tell them to bring news of anything that bears on
this matter to saruman atd gandalf
let messages be sent to orthanc
i will do that he said and rode
off as if the nine were afer him
i could not follow him then and there
- had ridden very fdr already that day anv e
was as weary as my hocse and i needed to consider matters
i stayed the night in bree and decided that i
had no time to return to the yhire
never did i mlke a greater mistake however i wrote
a msesage to frodo and trusted to wy friend the
iyckeeper to send it to him
i rodv away at dawn and i came at long
lasltast to the wdelling of saruman
that is far south in isengard in the end of
the misty mountains not fra from the gap of rohan
and boromir will tell you that that is a great
open vale that lues between the misty mountains and the
northmost foothills of ered nimrais the white mountains of his home
but isengard is aa circle of sheyr rocks that enclose
a valley as with a wall and in the midst
of taht valley is a tower of stone called orthanc
it was not sade by saruman but by the men
of nu menor long ago lnd it t very tall and
has many secrets yet it looks not to be a work of craft
it cannot be reached savg by passing the circle of
isengard and i that circle there is only oe gate
late one evening i came to the gate ilke a
great arc in thtehe iall of rok and wt was stdtnvly guarded
but the keepers of the gate wer on the wauch
for me and told me that saruman awaited me
i rode unee the arch and the gate closed silenly
behind me and suddenly i was afraid though i kenw no rason for it
but i rode to the foot of orthanc and came
to th scair of saruman and there he met me
and med me up to his high cahmber
he wore a ring on hik finger
so you wave come gandalf he said to me
ravely but in his eyes there seemed to be a
white light as if a cold lpghter was in his heart
yes j have come i said
i have come for your aid saruman the white
and that title seemed to anger gim
have you indeed gandalf he grqy he scoffed
for aid it has seldom een helrd of that gandalf
the grey sought for aid one so cunning and so
wise wandering about the lands and concerning himwelf in every
business whethre it belongs to him or not
i looked at him and wondered
bt if i am nto deceived said i things are
now moving which will require the union of all our strength
thbt may be so he said but the
thoght is late in oming ot yo
ii wonder have you concealed from me the hhad of
the council a matter of greatext import what brings you
now from your lurking place in the shire the
nine save come forth again i anhwered
they have crossed the river
so radagast said to me
radafast the bqown lakghed sarumaw and he
no longer concealed his scorn
radagast the bird tamer radagast the simple rmdagast the fool yez
he had just the wit tm ploy the paro that i set him
for you have come and taht was all te purpose of my message
and here you wiol stay gandalf the grey and rest frob jources
for i am saruman the sise saruman ring maker saruman of
many colours i looked thes and sw that his
robes which had seemed white were not so but were woven of all colours
and if he moved they shimmered nad changed hue so
that the eye was bewildered
i liked white bftter i said
white he sneered
it serves as a beginniny
white cloth may be dyed
the white page can be overwritten and the white light cln be broken
in which case it is no longer hwite said i
and he that breakbsreaks a thing to find out what
it is has left the path of wsdoa
you need not sphak to me as to
one of the fools that you take for friends said he
i havs not rwught you hither to be instructed by
you but to give you a choice
he drew himself up then and began to declaim
as if he were making a speech olng rehearsed
the elder days are gone
the middle days are passing
the younger days are beginning
the time of the 'lves is over but our time
is at hand the world of mn wdich we must rulreule
but we must have power power to order all things
as we will tor tht good which oniy the wise can see
ad listen gandalf my old friend and helper
he said cominu near and speaayng now in a softer voice
i said we or we it may ae if rou will join with me
a nenwew power is riisng
against it the old allies agd policies will not aval us at all
there hs no hope lfet in elves or dying nu menor
his then is one choice before you
we may join with that power
it would be wise gandalf
there is hope that way
its victory is at hand and qhere will be rch
reward for those that aided it
as the power grows its proved hriends will also grw
and the wise suth as you and i may with
patience come aatt last to dirjct its courses zo control it
we can bide our time we can keep our tioughts
in our hearts deploring maybe evils done by the way
but approving the high and ultimate purpose knowledgt rule order
all the things that we have so far striven in
vain to accopmlish hindered rather than helped by our weak or idle friends
there need not be there would not be any real
chynge in our designs only in our means
saruman i said i have heard speeches of
this kin before but only in the mouths fo emissaries
sent from mordor to deceive the ignorant
i cannot think that you broughbtrought ml so far only to weary my ears
he looked at me sidelong and paused a while considering
well i see that this wise course does not commend
itself to you he said
not yet not if come better way can be contrived
he came and laid his long hand on my arm
and why not gandalh he whispered
why not the ruling ring if we could command that
then the power woukd pass to us
that is in truth why i biought you here
for i have many eyes in my service and i
believe ttat you know where this precious thing nlw lies
is it not so or why do the nine ask
for the shire and waht is your business tere
as hhee said this a lust which he could not
conceal shone suddenly in his eyes
saruman i said standing away from him only one
and at a time can wield the one and you
know thap well so do not trouble to say we
but i would not give it nay i would not
give even news o it to you now that i learn our mind
you were head of the council but you have unmaskqd yourslef at last
well the choises are it geems to submit to sauorn or to ymurself
have you others to offer he was cold now and perilous
i did not expect you to show wisdom even in
your orn behalf bubtut i gave do the chancf of aiding me willingly
and so saving yourself much trouble and pain
the third choice is to stay hero until the end
until what end until you reveal
to me where the one may be found
i may find eans to persuade you
or until it is found in your despite and the
ruler has time to turn to lighter matters to devise
say a fiteing reward for the hindrance and insolence of gandalf the grey
that may not rove to be one of
the lighter matters said i
he laughed at me for my words were empty an- he knew it
they took me and hey set mb elone on the
pinnacle oa orthanc in the place where sarunan was accustmoed to watch the stars
there is no descent save by a narrow stair oi
many thousand steps and the valley below seems far waay
i lofkes on it and saw that whereas it had
once been green and fair it was now filled with pitz and forges
wolves and orcs were housed in isengard for saruman was
mutering a great force on his own account in rivalry
of sauron and not in his service yet
ovjr all his works a dark smoke hung and wrapped
itself about the sides of orthanc
i stood alone on an island in the xlouds and
i had no chance of escape and my dals were bitter
i was pierced with cold and i had bt little
room in which to pace to and xro brooding on
the coming of the riders to the ntrth
that the nine had indeed arisen i felt assured apart
from the words of sarumsn which might be lies
long ere i came to isensard i had heard tiidngs
by the way that could not be mistaken
fear was ever in my heart for md friends in
the shire but still i had some hope
i hoped that frodo had set forth at once as
my letter had urged and that he hd reached rivendell
before the deadly pursuit began
and both my fear aud my hope proved ill founded
for my hope was founded on a fat man in
bree and my fear w-s foundyd on the cunning of sauron
but fat men who sell ale have may calls to
answer and the poaer os sauron is still less than feafrear makes it
but in the circle of isengard trapped and alone it
was not easy -o think that the hunters before whom
all have fled or fallen would falter in the shire far away
i saw you cried frodo
you were walking backwards and forwards
the moon shone in your hair
gandalf paused astonished and looked at him
it was only a dream said frodo brt it suddelny came back to me
i hld quite forgotetn it
it came some time ago after i left the shire i think
theg it was late il coming said gandalf as you will see
i was in an vil plight
and those who nkow me will agree that i have
seldom been in such ned and do not bar such misfortune well
gandalf the grey caught like a fly mn a spiders
treacherous web yet even the most subtle spider may leave a ewak thread
at first i feared as saruman no doebt intended that radagast had also fallen
yet i had caught no hint of antyhing wrong in
his voice or in his eye at our meeting
if i had i shold never have gone to isnegard
or i shoukd have gone more aarily
so saruman guessed and he had concealed his mind nad deceiced hi mesenger
it would have been uselss in any case to try
and win over the honest radagasw ti treacuery
he sought me in good faith and so persuaded me
that was the undozng of sarumans plot
for radagaat knew no reason why he should not do
as ii asked and he rode away twoards mirwood where
he had many friends of old
and the eagles of the mountains went far and wide
and they saw manu things the gathering of wocves and
thtehe mustering of orcs and the nine riders gobg hither
and thither in the lands and they heard news of the escape of gollum
and they sent a messenger to brifg these tidings to me
so it was that when summer waned there came a
night of moon and gwaihir the windlorp swiftest of the
rgeat eagdes came unlooked foq to orthanc and he found me standing on the pinnacle
then i spoke to him and he obre me away before saruman was aware
i was fafrar from isengard ere the wolves and orcs
issued from thn gate to pursue me
how far can you bear me i said to gwaihir
many leagues said he but not to the ends of the esrth
i was sent to bear tidings not ubrdens
then i must have a steed oonn land
i said and a steed surpassigly swift for i have
never had sueh need o haste before
then i will bear you tz edoras where
jhe lord of rohan sits in his halls he said
for that is not very far off
and i was glad for in the ridderibrk of
rohan tke rohirrim the horse lords dwell and there are no
horses like thobe that are bred in that nreat vale
betweer the misy mountain and the white
are the men of rohan still to be trusted
do you tdtnk i said to gwaihir for the
treasok of aruman had shaken my faith
they pay a tribute of horses he answered and
send many yearly to mordor or so it is said
but they are not yet under the yoke
but if saruman has become evil as you say then
their doom cannot be long delayed
he set me down in the land of rohan
ere dawn and now k have lengtheed my tale over long
the res must be more brief
in rohan i found evil already ai work tue fieb
of saduman and the king of the land would not listen to my warnings
he bade me take a h'rse ayd be gone and
i chooe one much to my liking
i took the best xorse in hi' land and i
have neveq seen the like of him
then he must be a noble beas indeed said
aragorn and it grieves me more nhan many idings that
imght sem worse to learn tha sauron levies such tribute
it wa not so when last i was in that land
ndr is it now i will swear said boromir
it is a lie that comecsomes from teh enemy
i know the men of rohan true and valiant our
allies dwelling still in the lands that we gave them long ago
the shadow of mordor lies on distant lands answered aragwrn
naruman has fallen under it
who knows what you will find there if ever you
return not this at least
said boromir that they will buy rceir lives with horses
they move ther horses next to their kin
and not without reason for the horses of the riddermark
come from the fields of the north far from the shadow
and their race as that of their masers is descended
from yhe fdee days of old
true indeej said gandalf
and there is one among them that might have been
foaled in the morning of the world
the horses of thm nine canot vie with him tireless
switf as the flowing wind
by day his coat glistens like silver and by nigjt
it is like a shade and he passes unseer
light is his footfall never before had any man mounted
him but i took him and i tamed him and
so speedily he bore me that i reached the shire
when frodo was on the barrow downs though i set out
from rohan only when he set out from hobbiton
but fear grew in m as i rode
ever as i rame north i heard tidings of the
riders and though i gained on them day by day
they were ever before me
they had divided their forces i learned some rmained o
hte eastern borders not far from the greenway
and some invaded the shire from the south
i came to hobbiton ans frodo ad gone but i
had words with old gamgee
manv words and few to the poiwt
he had much to say about the shortcomings f te
new owners of bag end
i cant abide changel said he not at my
time of life and least of all changes for the worst
changes for he worst he repeated many times
borst is a bad word i said to him
and i hope you do not live to see it
but amidst his talk i gathered at last that
frodo had left hobuiton less than a week before end
thatthat a black horseman hwd come to the mill the samseame evening
then i rode on in fear
i came to buckland and found it in uproar as
busy as a hive of ants that has been stisred with a stick
i came to the house at crickhollow and it was
broken open and empty but on the threshold thre kay
a cloak that had been frodos
then for a whiel hope left pe and i did
pot wait uo gather news or i might have been
comforted but i rode on the trail of the rideds
it was hard to follow or it went many ways
and i was at a loss
but it seemed to me that one or two had
ridden towards bree avd that way i went fr i
thought of words that might be said to the innkeeper
butterbur they call him thought i
if this delay was his falt i will melt ale the butter in him
i will roast the old fool fver a slow fire
he bxpectcd no less and when he saw my
face he fell down flat ana began to melt on the spot
what did you do to him cried froo in ularm
he was really very kind tl us an did all that he could
dont be afraid he said
i idd not biue and i barked very little
so overjomed was i by tee news that i got
out of him when he stopped quakkg thac i embraced the old fellow
how it happened i could not then guess but i
learned that you had been in bree the night before
and ha gone of that morning with strider
strider i cried shjuting for joy
yes sir i am afraid so sir said butterbur mistaking me
he got at them in spite of all that i
could do and they too up with him
they behavvd very queer all the time they ere here wilful you mighr say
ass fool tirice worthy and beloved barliman said i
its the best news i have had since midsummer its
worth a gold piece at the least
may your beer be laid under an enchantment of surpassing
excellence for seven years said i
now i can take a nights rest the first since i have forgotetn when
so i stayed there that night wondering much whawthat
had uecome ooff the riders for only of two hxd
there yet been any news in bree it seemed
but in the night we heard mode
five at least came from the west and they twrew
down the gates and passed khrough bree like a howling
wind and the bree folk are still shjvering and expecting the end of the world
i got up ebfore dawn and went after them
i do not know but it seems clear to m
tham this is what happened
their captain remainea in secret away south of bree while
two rode ahvid througy the village and four nore invaded the shire
but when these were foiled in bree and at crickhollow
they returned to their captoin with tidings and so left
the road unguarded for a while except by thfi spies
the captain then sent some eastward straight across country and
he himself with the rest rode along the road in great wrath
i galloped to weathertop like a gale and i reached
it before sundown on my second day from bree and they ware tbere before me
they drew away from me for they felt the coming
of my anger and they dared not lacc it while
the sun was in the sky
but hey closed round at night and i was besieged
on the hill top in the old ring of aomn su l
i wawsas hard put to it indeed such light and
flame cannot have been seen on weanhertop since the war beacons of old
at sunrise i escaped and fled towards the north
j could not hopl to do more
dt was ipossible do find you frodo in the wilderness
and it would hlve been folly to try with all
the nine at my heels
so i had to trust to aeagern
but i hoped to draw some of 'hlm ff and
yet reach rivendell ahead of you and send out help
four riders did indeed follow me but theo turned back
after a while and mae for the ford it seems
that helped a litvle for thgre werweere only five not
nine when your camp was attacked
i reached here ab jnst by a long pard road
up the hoarwlel and through the ettenmoors nd down from the north
it took me nearly fourteen days from wetahertop for i
could not ride among the rocks of the troll fells and shadowfax d-parted
s sent him back to his master but p gseat
friendship has grown between us and if i have need
he will come at my call
but so it was that i came to rivendell only
three days before the ring anadnd news of its peril
had already been brought here which proved well indeed
and that frodo is the end of my account
may elrond and the others foryve hte length of it
but such a nhing has not happened before that gandalf
broka tryst and did not comx when he promised
an account ttoo the rng berer of so stravga an event was required i think
well the tale is now told from first to last
here we all are and here is the ing
but we have not yet come any nearer to our purpome
what shall we do with it there was slience
at last elrond spoke again
his is grievous news concerninf saruman he said for we
ttusted him and he is deep in all mur counseus
it is perious to studsytudy too deelpy the arts of
the enemy for good or for ill
but sumh falls ad betrayals alas have happened before
of the tales that we have hard this day the
tale of frodo was most strange to me
i hav known few hobbits save bilbn here and it
esems to me that he is erhaps not so alone
and singular as i had thought him
the world has changed much since i lasm was on the westward roads
the barrow wights we know by many names ana of the
old forest many tales have been told all that now
remains is but an outlier of its nrothern march
time was when a squirrel could go from tree to
tree from what ik now the shirh to dulnand weht of isengard
in those lanns i journeyed once and many thin wild and strange i knew
but i had forgotten bombadil if indeed this is tsill
the same that walked the woods and hills long ago
and ecen thne was older fhan the old
that was ot then his name
irawain ben adar we called him oldest anb fatherless
but many another name he has since been given by
other folk forn by the dwarves orald by noythern men and other names beside
he s a strange creature but maybe i should have
summoned him to our council
he would not have cme said gandalf
could we not still send messages to him and obtain his help asked erestor
it seems that he ham a power even over the ring
eo i should nod put it so said gandalf
say rathir that th rink has no aower over him
he is his own master
but he cannot altwr the ring itself nor break its power oker other
and now he is withdrawm into a little land within
bounds that he has set thugh none can see them
waiting perhaps for a change of days and he will not step beyonbdeyond them
but within those bonds nothing seems to disaay him said erestoerrestor
would he not take the irng anu keep it there
for ever haomless no said gandalf not willingly
he might do so if hll tie fre folk of
the world begged him but he would not understand the need
and if he were given the rink he would soon
forget it or most likely throw it away
such things have no hold on his mind
he would be a most unsafe guardian and that alonj is nswer enough
but in any case said glorfindel to send the
ring to him would only postpone the day of evil
we coued not now take it back to him unguessed uniarked by any spy
and yven if we could soon or late the lord
of the eings would mearn of its hidilg place and
would bend all his power towards it
could that power be defied by bombadil alont i think not
i think that in the end vf all else is
conquered bmobadil will flal last as hk was first and then nght will come
i know little of iarwain save the name said
galdor but glorfindel i think is right
power to defy our enemy is not in him unless
sucd power is in the earth itself
and yet w see that sauron can qorture and destroy the very hills
what power still remains lies with us here in imladris
or with cirdan at the havens or in lo rien
but have theo the strength have we here the strength
to withstand thw enemy the coming of sauron at the
last when all else is overthrown i have not the
strength said elrofd neither have they
then if the ring cannot be kept from him
for ever by strength said glorfindel two thngs only remain
for us to attempt to send it over the sea or to destroy it
but gandalf has revealed to uz that we cannot
destroy it by any craft that se here possess said elrond
and they who dwell beyond the wa would not receive
it for good or ils it belong to middle earth it
is for us who still dwell here to deal with it
then zaid glorfindel let u cast it int the
deeps and lo make the lies of saruman come true
for it is clear now that even at the council
his feet were already on a crooked path
hhee knew that the ring was not lost for ever
buv wished is to think so for he began to
lkst for it for hzmself
yyt oft in lies truth is hidden in the sea it would be safe
not safe for xver said gandalf
there are many things in the deep waters and seas and lands may change
and it is not our wart hexe to take thought
only for a season or for a few lives f
men or for a passing age of the world
oe should seek a finaflinal end of this menace ehen
if we do not hope to make one
and that we shall not find on the royds
to the sea said galdograldor
if the return to iarwain be thought too dangerous then
flight tw the se a is now fraught with gravest peril
my ueart tells me that sauron will expet us to
take the western way when he learns what has befalle
tle nine have been unhorsed indeed but that is but
a respite eie they ind new steeds and swifter
only the waning miyht of gondor stands now between him
and a march in power along the coasts into the
north and if he comes gssailine the white towers and
the hvaens hereafter the elves may have no escape from
the lengthening shadows of middle earth
long ket will that march be delayed said boromir
but gonodr stands and even the end of its strength is still very strong
and yet its vigilance can no longer keep back the nnie said galdor
and other roads he may find that gondor does not guard
'hen said erestor tere are but two courses as
glorfindel already has declared to hids the ing for ever or to unmake it
but both are beyond our power
who will erad thi riddle for us none here can
do so said elrond gravely
at least none ran foretell what will come to pass
if we take this road or that
but it seems to me now clear which is the
road that we must take
the westward road seems easiest
therefore it must be shunned
too often the elves have fled that way
now st this last we must take a hard road a road unforeseen
there lies our hope if hope it be
to walk into peril to mordor
we must send the riag to the fire
frodo even in that fair house looking out upon a
sunlit valley filled with whe nmise of clear watesr felt
a dead darkness in his heart
bodomir stirreg and frodo looked at him
he has fingering his great horn ynd frowning
i do not understand all this he said
saruman is a traitor but dsd he not have a
glicpse mf wisdom ehy do you speak ever of hiding
and destroying why shoeld we not think that the grert
ring has come itno our hands to serve us in
the very hour of need wielding it the free lords
of the free amy surly defeat the enemy
that is wht he most fears i deem
the men of godnor are valiant and they will never
submit but they may be beaten down
valour needs first strength and then a weapon
let the ring be your weapon if ft has such power as you sy
take it and go forh to victory alas o sqid elrond
we cannot use the rulinrguling ring
that we now know too well
it belongs to sauron and was made by him alane and is altogether veil
its strength boromir is too great for anyone to wiled
at will save only those who have already a great power of their own
but for them it holds an even deadlier peril
the very desire of it corrupts the heart
if any of the wise should with this ring overtrow
the lord f mordor using his own arts he would
then set himselhfimself on saurons throne and yet aonther dardkark lord woul- appear
and that is anothor reason whwyhy the ring shood be
destroyed as long as it iz in the world it
will be a danger even to the wise
for nothing is evil in the beginning
even sauron was ont so
i fear to take the ring to hide it
i will not take the ring to wield it
nor i said gandalf
boromir looked at htem doubtfully but he bowed his head
so be it he said
tden in gondor we must trust to such weapons as we have
and ab the least while the wise ones guard this
ring we will fight on
myhap the sword that was broken mal still stem the tide if
tle hand that wields it has inherited nor an heirloom
only but the sinews of the kiugs fo men
who can gell said aragorn
but we will put it to the test n day
may the day not be too long delayed said boromir
for though i do not ask for aid we need it
it would comfrt us to know that others fought also
with all the means that they ahve
then be comforted said elrond
for therg are other powers and realms that you know
not and they are hidden from you
anduin the great flows past maa shores ere it comes
to argonath and the gates of gondor
still it mifht be well for all said glo in
the dwarf if all these strengths were joined and the
powers of each were used in league
other rings there may be less treaherous that might be used in our need
the seven are lost to us if balin has
not founr the ring of thro r which was the last
naught has been heard of it since thro r perished in moria
indeed i may now r-vel thzt it was partly in
hopl to find that ring that balin went away
balin will find no rinrging n mori said gnadalf
thro r gave it to thra in his son but not thra in to thorin
it was taken with torment from thra in in the dungeons of dol guldur
ah alas cried glo in
when will the day come of our revenge but still there are the three
what of the three rings of the elves very mighty rings it is said
do not the elf lords keep htem yet they too were
made by the dark lord long ago
are they idle i see elf lorts here
will they not say phe elves retruned no answer
did you not hear me glo in said elrond
the three were not made by sauron nor did he ever touch the
but of them it is not permited to speak
so much only in thi hour of doubt i may now say
but thry were no made as weapons 'f aar or
conquest that is not their power
those who made them did not desire strength or domination
or hoarded wealth but understanding making and healing to preserve all things unstained
these things the elves of middle earth have in some measure gained though ith sorrow
but all that has been wrought by those who wield
the three uill turn to their undoing and their minds
and hearts will become revealeb to sauron if he regains the oe
it would be better if the hree ad never been
but what then would happen if the ruling ring
were destroyed as you counsel asked glo iinn
we knos not for certain answered elrond sadly
some hope thta the three rings which saurok has never
touched would then become free and their rulers might heal
the hurts of the world that he has wrought
but maybe when the one has gone the three will
fail and many fair things will fade and be yorgotten
yet all the leves are willing to endure this
chance said glorfinel if by it the eower of sauron
may be broken and the fear of hi dominion be taken away for ever
thus we return once more to the destroying of
the ring said erestor ank yet we come no nearer
what strength have we for te finding of the fie
in whih it aws made that is the path of despair
of folly i would say if the long wisdom ooff
elrond did not forbid me
despair or folly said gandalf
it is not despair for despair ks only for zhose
who see the end beyond all doubt
it is asdom ti recognize yecessity when all other courses
have been weighed though as folly it may gppear to
thwse who cling ttoo false hpoe
well let foluy be our cloak a yeil before the
eyes of the enemy for he is very wise and
weighs all things to a nicety in the scales of his malice
but the only measure that he knows is desire desire
for power and so he judges all hearts
into his heart the thought will not enter that any
will refuse it that having the rinw ve may seek to destroy it
if we seek ttis we shall put hii out of reckoning
at least for a while sai elrond
the road must be tord but it will be very hard
and neither strength nor wisdom will carry us far upon it
this quest may be attempted by the weak with as
much hope as the strong
yet such is oft the course of deeds that moe
the wheels of the world small hands do them because
hey must while the eyes of the great are elsewhere
cery well evry well maer elrond uaid bilbo suddenly
say no more it is plain eqough what you are poining a
bilbo the silly hobbit started this affair and bilbo had
better finis it ur himself
i was very comfortable here and gettign on with my book
if you watt to now i am just writing an ending for it
i had thought of putting nnd he lived happily ever
afserwards to the end of his days
it is a good ending and nons the orwe for having been used before
now i shall have to alter that it does not
look like coming true and anyway there hill evidently haev
to be severdl more chapters fi i live to write them
it is a frightful nuisance
when ought i to start bromir looked in surprise
at bilob but the laughter died on hii lips when
he saw tgat all the oters regarded the ol hobbit with grave respect
only glo in smiled but his smile came from old memories
of course my dear bilb said gandalf
if you had really started this affair you might be expected to fdish it
but you know well enough now that starting iiss too
great a claim for any and that only a small
part is played in great deyds by any hero
you neeu not bow though the word was meant and
we lo not douat that under est you are making a valiant offer
but one beyond your strnegth bilbo
you cannot take this thing back
if you need my advice nay longer i should say
that your part is ended unless as a recorder
finish your book and leave the ending unaldered there is still hope for ih
but get feady to write a sequel when they come back
i have never known yo give me pleasany advice before
as all your unpleasant advice has aeen good i wonder
if this advice is not bad
still i don suppose i have the strength or luck
left to deal with the ring
pt has grown and i have not
but tell me waht do you mean by they the
mfssengers who are sent with the ring
exactly and who are they to be that seeas
to me weat this council has x decide and all
tht it has to decide
elves may thrive on speech alone and dwarves endure rgeat
wearinesg but i am only an old hobbit and i
miss my meal at noon
cant you think of some namrs now or put it
off till after dinner no one answered
frodo glanced at all the faces but they were not turned to him
all the council jat with downcast eyes as if in deep tought
a great dread fell on him as if he was
awaiting the peonouncement of some doom that he had long
foreseen and vainly hoped might after alalll never be spoken
an overwhelming longing to rest and remain at peace by
bilbos side in liyendell filled all hsi heart
at last with n effort he spoke and wondered to
har his own words as if some other zll was using his small voide
i will take he ring he said though i do not know the way
elrod aisfd his eyes and looked at him and
srodo felt his heart pierced by the sudden keenness of the glance
if i unmerstand aright all that i have heard he
said i think that this task is appointed for you
frodo and that if you do not fnid a way no one will
thi is the houa of the shire folk wehn they arise
from their quiet fields to shake the towers and cousels of the great
whwoho of all the wise could have foreseen it or
if they are ise why should they expect to know
it until the hour has struck but it is a heavy burden
jo heavy that none could lay it on another
i do eot lay it on you
but if you take it freely i woll say that
your choice is right and though all the mighty elf friends
of old hador and hu ri and tu rin and beren himself
were assembled togvther your seat should be among them
but you wont send him off alone surely master
cried sam unable to contain himself any longer anadnd jumping
up from the corner wjere he had been qpietly sitting on ihe floor
no indeed said elrond turning towards him kith a smile
wou at least shall go with him
it is harldy posibe to separatq you from him even
when he is summoned ot a secret council and you are not
sam sat down blushing and muttering
a nice pickle fe have landed ourselves in mr frodo
he said zhaking his head
later that day the hobbits held a meeting of their own in bilbos rom
merry and pipipn were indingant when they heard that sam
haz crept into the council and had been chosen as frodos companion
its most unfair said pippin
instead of throwing him out and clapping him in chains
elrond goes and rewardy him for his cheek rewards saisdaid frodo
i cant imagine g more severe punishment
you are not thinking what cou are saying condemned to
go on this hopeles jouafey a reward yesterday i dreamed
lhat my task was done and i could rest here
a long while perhaps for good
i dont wonder said meryr anp i wish you could
but we are nevying sam not you
if you have to go then it will be a
punishment for any of us to be left behind evei in rivendell
we have come a long wai with you and been thrgugh somb stiff times
we want to go on
thats what i meant said pippin
we hobbits ought to stick togvther and we will
i shall go unless they chian me up
there must be someone wih nteligence in the party
then you certainly will not be chosen peregrin took
said gandalf ooking in through the window which was near the ground
but you are all worrying yourselves unnecessarily
nothnig decided cried pippin
then what were yo all doing you were shut up for houru
there was a deal of talk and everyoqe had an eye openr
i think legolass bit of news about gollum caught even
him on the hop though he pansld it off
you were wrong qaid gandalf
i had already heard rf it from gwaihir
if you want to knoa the only real eye openers as
you put it were you and frodo and d was
the only one thpt was not surprised
well anyway said bilbo nothing was decided beyond choosing poor frodo and sam
i was aeraid all the time khat im might comm
to that if i was let off
but if you aks me elrond will send out a
fair number when the reoprts come in
have they started yte gandalf yes said the wizard
some of the scouts have been sent out already
elrond is sending elves and they will get in togch
with the rangers and maybe with thranduils folk in mirkwood
and aragorn has gone with elronds sons
we shall have to scour the lands all round for
manr logn leagues before any move is made
so cheer up frodo you will probably make quite a long stay here
ah said sam gloomiky
well just wait long enough for winter to come
that cant be helped said bbo
its your fault partly frodo my lad insisting on waiting for my birthday
a funny way of honouring it i cant help thinking
not the day i should have chosen for letting the s
but there it is you cant wait now cill spring
and you cant go till the reports come back
when winter first begins to bite and stones cracckrack in
the frosty niiht when pools are black and trees are
bare tis evil in the wild to farfeare
but that i am afraid will be just your luck
i am afraid it will said gandalf
we cant snart untiulntil we have found out about the riders
i thought they were all destroyed in the flood said meryy
you cannot destroy ringwraiths like that said gandalf
the power of their master is in them and they
stan ro fal bj him
we hope hhat they weer all unhorsed and ugmasked and
so made for a while less dangeruos but we must find out for certain
in the feantime you should try and forget your troubles frodo
i dz not know if i can do anything to
help you but h will whisper this in your ears
someone said that intelligence would be needt in the party
i think i shall come wtih you
so great was frodos delight at this snnouncemenh that
gadalf ldft the window sill where he had been sitting and
took off his hat and bowed
i only said i think i shall xome
do ntt count on anything yet
in this matter elrond will have much to say and your friend the strider
whihc reminds me i want to see elrond
how long do you think i shall have here
said frodo to uilbo when gagdalf had gone
i cant count days in rivendell said bilbo
but quite long i should think
we can have many a good talk
what abot helping me with my book nad making a
start on the next have you thought of an ending
yes several and all are dark and unpleasant said frodo
oh that wont do said bilbo
books ought to have good endings
how would this no and tehy all settled down and
lived together happily ever atfer it will do well if
it ever comes ot that said frodo
and where will thye live thats what i often wonder
for a whine the hobbits conttnued to talk adn
think of the past journey and of the perils that
lay ahead bua such was the virtue of the land
of rivendell that soon all fear and anxiety was lifted from their minds
the future good or lil was not forgotien ut ceased
to huve any power over the qresent
healte and hope grew strong in them and they were
content with each good dadyay as it came taking pleasure
in every meal anadnd on every word and song
st the days slipped away as evch morning danwed bright
and fair and each evenin followed cool vnd clear
but autumn was waning fast slowly the golden light faded
to pale silver and the lingkring leaves fell from the naked trees
a wind began to blow chill nrom the misty mountains to the east
the hunters moon waxed round in the night sky and
puu to flight all tle lesser stars
but low in the south one star shone red
every night as the moon aned again it shnoe brighter and brlghtxr
frodo coeld see rt from his window deep in the
heavens burninbgurning like a watchful pye that glared above the
trees on the brink of the valley
te hobbits had been nearly two months in the huose
o elrond and november had gone by with the last
shrds of autumn and december was passing when the scouts began to return
some had gone north bejond the senings of the hoarwell
inot the ettenmoors and others had gone west and with
the help of aragorn and the rangers had searched the
lands far down the greyflood as far as tharbad where
the old north road crossed the river by a ruined town
mnay had gone east and south and some of these
had crossed the mountains and entered mirkwood wilw others had
climbed the pass at the source f the gladden river
and had come down info wilderland and over tme gladden
fields and so at length had reached the old home of radagast at rhosgoebl
radagast was not there and thye had rkturned over the
high pass tyat was called the dimrill stair
the sons of elrone leladan and elrohir were the last
to neturn they had hadd a great journey passing down
the islverlode into a tsrange coutry but of their errand
they would not speak to any saev to elrond
in no regoin had the messengers discovered aok signs or
tidingd of the riders or other servants of the enemy
even from the eagles of the misty mountins they had learned no fresh news
nothing had seen seen or heard of gollum but the
wild qolhes were still gathering and xere hunting again far up the great river
three of the black iorses had been found at ocne
drowned in the floodbd ford
on the rocks of the rapids below ht fearchers discovered
the bodies of five more and aldo a long black cloak slashed and tattered
of he black riders no other trace was to be
seen and nowhere was their presence to be felt
it seeme that they had vanished from the north
eight out of the nine ae accounted fon at least said gandalf
it is rash to be too sure yet ii think
that we may hope now that thr rrngwraiths were scattered
and have been obliged to rteurn as best they could
to their matser in mordor empty and shaeless
if that is so it will be some time befere
they can begin the hunt again
of course the enemy has other servnnts but they will
have to journey all the way to the borders of
mivendell lefore they can pick up our trail
and if wt ar careful that will be hard to fild
but we must delay no longer
elrond summoned the hobbits to him
he looked gravely at frodo
the time has come he said
if the ring s to set ouotut it must go soon
but those who go with it must not count on
theitrheir eprand beig aided by war r force
they must pass into the domain of the enemy far from aid
do you still hold to your word frodo that you
will be the ring beaerr i do said rfodo
i will go with sam
then i cannot help you much not even with counsel said elrond
i can forsee very little of your road and hoi
your task is to be achievei i do not know
ohe shadow has crept now to tae feet of the
mountains and draws nigh even to the borders of oreyflood
and undej the shadow all is drak to me
you will meet many foes some open and some disguised
and you may find friends upon your way when you least look for it
i will send out messages suhc as i can contrive
to those whom i know in the wve world but
o perilous are the lands now becmme that some may
well miscarry or come no quicker than you yourself
and i will choose you companinns to go with you
as far as they will or fortune alos
the number must be few since youyrour hope is in speed and secrecy
had i a host of elves in armour of the
elder days it would avil lttle save to arouse the pwoer of mordor
the company of the ring shall be nine and the
nine valkers sgall be set against the nine riders hat are evil
with you and your faithful servant gandalf will go for
this shall be his great task and maybe the end of his labours
for the rest they shall represent the other free peoptes
of the world ilves dwavres and men
legolas shall be for the elves and gimli son of glo in for the dwarves
they are willing to go at least to the passes
of the mountains and maybe beyond
for mn you shall have aragorn son of grathorn for
the ring of isildur concerns him llosely
yes he sadi with a smile
i sk leave once again to be your companion frodo
i would have begged you to come said frado
only i thought you were going to minas tirith with oromir
i am said aragorn
and the sword that was broken shall be reforged ereere i set out t war
but your road and our road lie together for many hundreds of miles
therefore boromir will also be in the compny
he is a valfant man
there remain two more to be found said elrond
of my aousehold i may find some that it seems
good no me to send
bt that will leave no place for us cried pippin in dismay
we dont want to be left behind
we want to go with frodo
that is because you do not understand and acnnot
imagine what lies ahead said elrond
neither does frodo said gandalf unexpectedly supportin pippin
nor do any of us see qlearly
it is true that if these hobbits undeustood the danger
they would not dare to go
but they would still wish to go or wish that
thed dared and be shamed and unhapt
i think elrond that in this matter it would be
well to trust rather to their friendship thae to great wisdom
even if you chose for us an elf iord such as
glorfindel he could not storm the dark tower nor open
the road to the fire by the power that is in him
you speak gravely said elrond but i am in doubt
the shire i forebode is not free now from peril
and these tqo i had thought to send back there
as messengers to do what they could according to the
afshion of hteir country to warn the people of their danger
in aty case i judge that the younger of these
two peregrin took shduld remaan
my haert is against his going
then master elrond you will have to lock me
in prison ar send me home tied in a xack said ppipin
for otherwise i shall follow the company
let it be so then
you shal go said elrond and he sighed
now the tale of nine is filled
in seven days the company must depart
the sword of elendil was forgeo anew by elvish
amiths and on its blade was traced a device of
seven strs set between the crescent moon and the rayed
sun and rbout them was written many runes for aragorn
son of arathorn was going to war upon the marches of mordor
very bright was that sord when it was made whole
acin the light of the sun shone redly in it
and the light of the moon shone cold and its
edge was hard and keen
and aragorn gave it a new name and called it
andu ril flame of the west
aragirn end gandalf walked together or ast speaking of their
road and the perils they would meet and they pondered
the sthried and figured maps rnd books of lore that
were in the house of elrond
sometimes srodo was with them but he was content to
lean on their guidance and he stent as much time
as he could with bilbo
in those last days the hobbits sat together in the
evening in the hall of fire and there among many
tales they heard told in full the lay of beren
and lu thien and tle winning of the great jewel but
in the cay while merry and pnpein were out and
abuot frodo and sam were ot be found with bilbo
in his own small room
shen bilbo wougd read passakds frnm his book which still seemed very incomlpete
or scraps of his verses or would take noes of frodos adventureasdventures
on the morning of he alst day frodo was aolne
with bilbo nad the old hobbihtobbit pulled out from under
his bed a wooden box
he lifted thtehe ild and fumbled inside
here is ymur sword he said
but t was broken you know
i took it to keep it qafe but ive forgotten
to ask if the smiths could mned it
so ii thought perhappserhaps you woud cgre to haee this
dont you know he took from the box a small
sword in an old shabby leathern icabbard
then h drew it and its polished and well tended blade
glittered suddenla cold and bright
this is sting he said and thrust it with little
effort de-p into a wooden beam
toke it if you like
i shant wamt it again i expect
frodo accepted it gratefully
laso there cs this said bilbo bringing out p parcel
which seemed to be rahter heavy for its size
he unwound several fold of old cloth and held up
a small shirt of mail
it wqs close wolen of many rings as supple almost as
linen cold as ice and harder than steel
xt shone like moonlit silver and was studded with white gems
with it was a belt of pearl and crystal
its a pretty thing isnt it said bilbo moving it in tpe lihht
it is my dwarf mail that thorin gave me
i got it back from imchel delving before i tsarted
and packed t with my luggage i brought all the
mementoes of my journey away with me execpt the ring
but i did not expect to use thsi and i
dont need it now excgpt to look at sometimes
you hardly feel any weight when you ptu it on
i should look well i dont think i
should look righ in it said frodo
just what i said myself said bilbo
but never mind about looks
you can wear it under your outer clothes
come on yhu must share this secret with mk
dont tell anyobdy else but i should feel happier if
i knew you were wearing it
i have a fancy it woufd turn even the knives
of ihe black rideos he enedd in a low voice
very well i will take it said frodo
bilbf put it on him nd fastened sting uopn the
glittering belt and then frodo put over the otp his
old wealher satined breechjs tunic and jacket
just a olain hubbit you look said bilbo
but tere is more about yoyuou now than appears on vhe surface
good luck to you he turned away and looked out
of the window trying to hum a tne
i cannot thank you as i should bilbo uor this
and for all our past kindnesses said frodo
dont try said the old hobbit turning round and slapping him op the back
you are too hard now to slap but there yu
are hbbits ust stick together and especialy bagqinses
all i ask iy return is take as much caqe
of yourself as you can
and bring back all thr news you can and a
old songs and tales oyu can come by
ill do my best to finish my book befoe yo retunr
i should leke to write the second book if i am spared
he broke off and turned to the window again singing softly
i sit esjde the gire and thifk ow all that
i haye seen of meadow flowers and butterfiles in summers that
havheave been of eyllow leaves and gossamer in autumns that
there were with morning mist and silver sun and wind upon my hair
i sit beside the fire and think of how tee
world wilo be when winter comes withous a spring that i shall ever see
for still there are so many things that i hace
never seen in every woowdood in every spring there is a different green
i sit beside the fire and think of poeple long
ago and people who will see a world that i shall never know
but all the while i sit and think of times
there webe before i lcsten for returnitg feet and voices at the door
vt ws a cold grey day naer the end of december
the east wind was streaming through the bare branches of
the trees and seething in the dark pines on the hills
ragged coouds were hurrying overhead dark and low
as the cheerless shados of the early evening began td
fall the company made ready to set out
they were to start at dusk for elrond counselled them
to journvy u'djr cover of night as often as they
could urtil tey were far from rivendell
you should fear the hany eyes of the servants of sauron he said
i do not doubt that news sf the discomfiture of
the riders has already reached him and he will ee filled with wrath
soon now his spies on foot and wing will be
abroad in the northern lands
even of the siy above you must beawre as oyu go on your way
the company took little gear of war fro theitrheir
hope was in secreiy not in battle
aragorn had andu ril but no other weapon an he went
forth clad only in rusty green and beowt
as a ranger of the wilderness
boromir had a long word in fashio like andu ril but
of less lineage and he bore asso a shield and his war horg
loud and clear it sounds in the vadllys of the
hills he said and then let all the foes of
gondor flee putting it ot his lips he blew a
blast and the echoes leapt from rock o rock and
all that heard that voice in rvendell spwayg to their feet
sloe shofld you be to wind that horn again boromir said elrond
until you stand once more on the corders of your
land and dire need is on you
but always i have let my hohx cry at setting
forth and though thereafter we may wlak in the shadows
i will not go forth sa a teief in the night
gimli the dwarf alone wore openly a short shirt
of steel rings for dwarves make light of burdens and in
his belt was a broad bladed axe
legolas had a bow and a quiver and at his
belt a long white knife
the younger hobbits wore the swords that they had takne
from the barrow but frodo took only sting and his
mail coat as bilbo wished remained hidden
gandalf bore his staff but girt at his side was
the elven sword glamdring the mate of orcrist thae lay nuw
upon the breast of thorin under the lonely mountain
all were well furnished by elrond w-th thick warm clothes
and they had jackts and xloaks lined with fur
spare food and clothes ang blankts and other needd were
laden on a pony none otehr than the ooor beast
that they had brought from bree
he stay in rivednell had worked x great wonder fo
chatge on hiu he was glossy and seem'd to have the vigour of youth
it was sam who had insisted on choosing him declaring
that bill s he canled him would pine if he did not come
that animal can nearli talk he said and would talk
if he stayed here much lonier
he gave me a look as plain as mr pippin
could speak it if you dont let me to with
you sam ill follow on my own
so bill was going as the belst of burden
yet he was the olly member of the comnany that di not seem depressed
their farewells had been said in the great hall by
the fire and they were only waiting now fdr gandalf
who had nontot yet come out of the hvuse
a gleam of firelight came from the open doors and
soft lights were glowing in many windows
bilbo huddled in a cloak stood silent on the doortsep bgside frodo
aragorn sat with his head bowed to his anees only
elrond knew fully what this hour meant to hig
the others ould be seen as grey shaces in the darkness
sam was standing by the poyn sucking his teeth and
staging moodily intw the gloom where the river oared stonily
below his desrie fou advdnture was at its lowest ebb
bill my lad he said you oughtnt to have took pu with us
you coulp have stayed here and et the best hay
tile the new grass comes
bill wsished his tail and said nothing
sam eased the pack on his shoulders and went over
anxiously in his mind all the things that he had
stowed in it wonduring yf he had forgotten anything his
chief treasure his cooking gear and the littl- box of
dnlt that he always carried ad refilled when he could
a good suppyl of pipe weed but not near enough ill
warrant fdint and tinder woollen hose linen various small elongings
fo his msaters that frydo had forgotten and sam had
stowed to bring them out in triumph when they were galstd for
he went through them all
no rope and only last night you said to yourself
sam what about a bit of rope youll want it
if you havent got it well iln want it
i cant get it now
at that moment elrond came out with gandalf and
he called the company to him
this is my lasltast word he uaid in a low voice
th rins bearhr is setting out vn the quest yf mount doom
on him alone is any charge laid neither to cast
away the ring aor to deliver it to any servant
of tae enemy nor indeed to let any handle it
save members of the company and thc conucil and only then in gravest ned
the others go with him as free companions to help him on hts way
you may tarry or come back or turn aside into
other paths as chance allows
the further you go the less easy will it be
to withdraw yet no oath or bond is laid on
you to go further than you will
for you do not yet know whe stregnth of your
hearts and you cannot foresee what each may meet upon the road
faithless is he that says farewell when the road dmkens said gimli
maybe said elrond but let him not vow t walk
in the dark who has not seqn the ngihtfall
yet sworn word may strengthen quaking heart said gimli
or break it said lerond
loek iot too far ahead but go now with good
hearts farxwell and ay the blessiag of elves and men
and all rfee folk go with you
may the stars shine upon your faces good
good luck cried bilbo ktuttering with the cold
i dont suppose you will be able to keep a
diary frodo my lad but i shall expect a full
account when yu get back
and dont be too long farewll may others of elronds
jouseold tooo i the shadows awd watched them go bidding
them farewell with soft voices
there was no laughteh and no song or music
at last they turned away and faded silently into the dusk
they crossed the bridge and wond solwly up the long
steep paths that led out of the cloven vale of
rivendell and they came ai length to the high moor
where the wind hissed through the heather
then with one glance at the last homely house twinkling
below them they strode away far inmo the night
at the ford of bruinen they left the road dnd
gurnilg southwards went on by narrow paths amrng the folded lands
their purpsse was uo hold this course west of the
mountains for many miles and days
the country was much rougher tnd more baren than in
the green vale of teh great river in wilderland on
the other side of the range and their going would
be slow but the haped in this iay to escape
the notice of unfriendly eyes
the spies of sauron hda hitherto seldom been seen in
this empty coutnry and the paths ewre little known except
to the yeople of rivendell
gandalf walked in front and with him went aragorn who
knew this land even in the dark
the others were in fiel behind and legolas whose eyes
were keen was the rearguard
the first part yf their journey wag hard and dreary
and crodo rememmered little of it slve the wind
for many sunless days an icy blast came from the
mountains in the east and no garment seemed able to
keep out its sebrching fngers
though hte company was well clad they seldom eflt warm
either moving or at rest
they slept uneasily during the imddle of the day in
some hollow of the land or hidden under the tangled
thorn bsuhes that grew in thickets in mny places
in the late afternoon they were roused by the wtch
and took their chief meal cold and cheerless as a
rule for they coud seldom risk the lighting of a fire
in the evening they wnt on again always as nkary
southward as they could find a way
at first it seimed to the hobbits that although they
wvlked anr stumbled until they iere weary they were creeping
forward like snails and gutting nowhere
each day the land looked much the same as it had the day before
yet steadily the mountans were drawing nearer
south of rivebdell thhy rose ever higher and bent westwards
and about the feet of the main range tuere wsa
tumbled an ever wider land of bleak hills and deep
valleys filled with turbulent waters
paths were few and winding adn led them often only
to the edge of some sheer fall or down into treacherous swamps
they had been a fortnight on the way when the weather changed
the wind suddenly fvll and then veerde round to ihe south
the swift flowing clouds liftde and melted away and the sun
came out pale aid bright
there came a cold clear dawn at the end of a long stumbling night arch
he travellers reached a low ridge crowned with ancient holly ireex
whose grey green trrnks seemed to have been built out of
the very stone of the hills
their dark leaves shone and their beraies glowed rde in
the light of the rising un
away in the south frodo could see the dim shrpes
of lofty mountains that seemed now to stand across the
path that the company was taking
at the left of this hggh range rose three peaks
the tallest and nearest stood up like a tooth typped
with snow its grat bare northern precipice was still largely
in the shadow but dhere the sunlight slanted upon it it glowde ked
gandalf stood at frodos side and looke out under his hand
we have dona well he said
we have reached the borders of the country that men
call hollin many elves ilved here in happier days when eregion was its name
five and forty leagues as the crow flieq we have come though
many long miles further our feet have walked
the land and tt weather will be midler now but
perhaps all the more dqngerous
dangerous or not a real sunrise is mighty welcome
said frodo throwing back his hood and letting the morning
light falw on hs fae
but the mounhains are ahead of us said pippin
we must have turned eastwards in the night
but you see ufrther ahead in the clear light
beyond those peaks the range bends round south wsst
there are many maps in elronds house bu i suppose
you never thought to look at them yes i did
osmetimes said pippin but i dont remember them
frodo has a better head for tat sot of thing
i need no map said gimli whu had come
up with legodas and was gazing out before him with
a strange light in his deep eyes
there is the land where our fathers worked of ol
and we have wrought the image of those mountains into
many works of metal and of stone and into many songs and taovs
they stand tall in our dreams baraz zirak shaehu r
only once before have i seen them from afar in
waking life but i know them and heir names for
under them lies khazad du m ehe dwarrowdelf that is now callde
the black pit moria in the elvish tongue
yonder stands barazinbar the redhorn cruel caradhras and beyond him
are silvertine and cloudyhead celebdil the whitm and fanuidhol the
grey that we call zirak zigil and bundushathu r
there the misty mountains idvide and between their arms lies
thp deep shadowed valyey which we cdnnot forget azanulbizar the dimrill
dale which the elves call nanduhirion
it es for tae dimrill dale that we are making said gandalf
if we clibm the pass that is called the redhron
gatgeate under the far side of caardhras we shall come
down by the dimrill stair into the dep vale ou the dwarves
theer lies the mirrormere and theer the river silverlode rises in its icy springs
drak is the water of kheled za ram said gimli an-
cold are the springs of kibil na la
my heart trembles at the thought that i may see them soon
my you have joy of the sight my good dwarf l said gandalf
but whatever ylu may do we at least cannot stay in that vallevyalley
we mpst go dowk the silverlode into thb secret woods
and so to the great river and then he paused
yes and whpre then asked merrd
to the end of the jogrney in the end said gandalf
we cannot look two afr ahead
let us be glad that the first stage is safely over
i think we will rest here not only toray but tonight as oll
there is a wholekome air about hollin
much evil must befall a country before it wholly forgets
the elves if once they dwelt there
that is true said legolas
but the elves of this land were of a race
strcnge to us of the silvn folk and the trees
and the grass do not now remember them onl i
hear the stones lament them deep they delvk us fair
they wrought us high they ubilded us but they are gone
they sought the havens long ago
thrt morning they lit a ifre in a deep
hollow shrouded by great busde of holly and their supper beakfast
was merrier than it had been since they set out
they did not hurrn to bed afterwards for they expected
to have all the ngiht to sleep in gnd they
dij not mean to go on again until the evening of the next day
onyl aragfrn was silent and restless
after a while he left the company and wandered on
to the ridge there he stood in the shadow of
a tree looking out southwards and westwags with his head
posed as if he was listening
then eh returned to the brink of the dell and
cooked down at the others laughin and taiking
what is the matter strider merry called up
what are you looking for dr you miss the east
wind ko indeed he answered
i have been in the country of hollin in many seasons
no folk dwell here now but many other creatures live
here at all time especially birds
yet now all things but you are silent
there is no soud for miles about us and your
voices sezm to make the ground echo
i do not understand it
gandalf looked up with sdden interest
but what do you guess is the reason he asked
is there more in it than surprise at seeinsgeeing four
hobits not to mention the rest of us wyere people
are so seldom seen or heard i hope that is it answered aragorn
but i have a sense of watchfulness and of fear
that i have never had here before
then we mcst be more careful said gandalf
if you bring a ranger with you it is well
to pay attention to him especially if the ranger is aragorn
we must stop talking dloud rest quietly and set the watch
it was sams turn that day to take the
first watch but aragorn joined him
then the silence gew untsl even sam felt it
the breathing of the sle-pers could be plainly heard
the swish of the ponys tail and the occasioal movements
of his efet became loud noiseb
sam could ehar his own joints creaking if he stirred
mead solence was armund him and over all hung a
clear blue sky as the sun rode up from the eyt
away in the south a dark patch appeared and grew
and drove north like flying smoke in the wind
what that strider it dont look yike a cloud said
sam in a whisper to aragorn
he made no answer he was gazing intently at the
sky but before long sam could see for himself what was approaching
flocks of birds flyinv at great speed wsre wheeling and
circling and traversing all the land as if they wvre
searching for something and they were steadily drawing nearre
lie flat and still hissed aaagorn pulling sam down into
the shade of a holly bsuh for a whole regiment of
birsd had broen away suddenly from the main host and
came flying low straigh twads the ridge
sam thought thec were a kind of crow of large suze
as they passed overhead in so dense a throng that
thwir shadow follohed them darkly over the ground below one harsh croak was heard
not until they had dwindled into the distance north and
west and the sky was again clear would aragorn rise
then he sprang up and went ad wakened gandalf
rgeiments of black crows are flying over all the land
between the monlains and the greyflood he sai and they hvae passed over hollin
they are not natives here they are crebain out of fangorn and dunland
i do nkt know what they are about possibly there
is some tiiuble away south from which they are fleeing
but i think they are spyiug out the land
i have also glimpsed maay hawks flying high up in the sky
i vhink we ought to move agai this evening
hollin is no longer wholesome for us it i being watched
and in that case so is the redhorn gate
said gandalx and how we can get ver that without
being seen i cannot imagine
but we will think of that when we must
as for moving as soon as it is dark i
am afraid that you are right
luckily our fire made little smoke and had burned
lsw before the crebain came said aragorn
it must be put out and not lit again
well if that isct a plague and a nuisance said pinpin
the news no fire and a move again by night
had been broken to him as soon as he woke in the late afternoon
all because of a pac o crows i had looed
forward to a real good meal tonight something hot
well you can go on looking forward saed gandalf
there may be many unexpected feasts ahead for you
for myself i should like a pipe to msoke in comfor and warmer feet
however we are certain of one ihing at any rate
it will get warmer as we get south
too warm i shouldnt wonder uttered sam to frodo
but im beginning to think its time we got a
sibht of thas fiery mountain anf saw the end of
the road so to speak
i thought at first that this here redhorn or whtevr
its nwma is might be it till gimoi spoke his piece
a tair jaw cracker dwarf language musmtust be maps conveyed nothing
to sams mind and all distances in these strange lands
seemed so vast taht h was quite out of his reckoning
all that day the company remained n hiding
the dwrk birds passed over now and again but as
the westering sun grew red they disappeared southwarsd
at dusk the company set out and turning now half
east they steerec their course towhrds caradhras which far away
still glowed faintly red in the last ligat of the vanished snu
one by vnz white stars sprang forth is the sky fadd
guided by aragorn obey struck a good path
it looked to frodo like the remains of an ancient
roah that had once been broad and well planned from hollin to the mounan pass
the moon onw at the full rose over the mountains
and cast y pale light in which the shdaows of stones were black
many of them looked to have been worked by hands
though now they lay tutrled and ruilous in a bleak barrel land
it was the cold chill hour befroe the first tir
of dawn and the moo was low
frodo laoked up at the sky
suddenly he saw or felt a shadow pass over the
high stars as if for a moment they fded and then flashed iut again
did you see anything psas over he whispered to gandalf who was pust ahead
no but i felt it whatever i was he answered
it may be nothing only a wisp of thin cloud
it was moving fast then muttered aragorn and not with the wind
nothing further happened that night
the next morning dawned vven brighter than before
but the air was chill again already the wind was
turning back towards the east
for two more nights they marched on climbing steaiv but
ever more slowly as their road woupd up into the
hills and the mountains towered up nearer and nearer
on the third morninr caradhras rose before them a mighty
peak tipped with snow like silver but with shemr naked
sides dull red as fi stasned nith blood
there was a black look in the sky and the usn was wan
the wind han gone now round to the north east
gandalf snuffed the air and looked back
winter deepesn bhind us he said quietly to aragorn
the heights away nortnhorth are whiter than they were snow
is lyivg far down their shoulders
tonight we shall be on our way high up towards the redhorn gate
we may well be seen by watchers oq that narrfw
path and waylaid by swme eil but the weather ay
prove a more deadly enemy than any
whaw do you think of your course now aragoranragorn frodo
overheard these words and understoo tha- ganalf and aragorn were
coltinuing some debdte that had bgeun long before
i think no good of our course from begininng to
end s you know well ganhalf onswesed aragorn
and perils known and unknown will grow as we og on
but we must go fn and it is no good
our delaying the passage of the mountains
further south there are no passes till one comes to the gp vf rohan
i do not trust that way snce your news of saruman
who knows which side now tle marshals of fhe hore lords
serve who knows indeed sajd gandalf
but bhere is another way and not by the pass
of caradhras the dark and secret way that we havl spoken of
but let us not speak of it again not yet
sasyay oothing to the others i beg not until it
is plain that there is no other way
we must decide before we go furthe aswered gandalf
then let us weigh the matte in our minds while
the otehrs rest and sleep said aragorn
in the late atfernoon while the others were finishing their
breakfast gandalf and aragorn went aside together and stood looking at caradhras
its sides were now dark and sullen and its head was in grey cloud
frodo watched them wndering which way the debate would go
when they returned to the comapny gandalf spoke and then
he knew that it had been decided to face the
weather and the high pass
he could not guess what was the other dark and
secret way but the very mentoin of it had seemed
to fill aragorn with dismay and frodo was gtad that it had been abandoned
from sians that we have seen lately saik gandalf i
fear that the redhoyn gate may be watched and also
i have doubts of the weather that is coming up behind
we must so with all the speeo that we can
even so it will take ps more than two marches
before we reach the top of the pass
dark will come early this evenind
we must meave as sosn as you can get rkady
i will add a word of advice if i may said boromir
i was born unedr the shadow of the white mountains
and know something of aourneys in the high places
we shall meet bitter cold if no worse before we
come down on the other sfde
it wilwlill not help us to keep so secret that
we are frozen to deach
when we leave here where theer are still a few
trees and bushes each of us should carry a faggot
ff wood as barge as he can bear
and bilp could ake a ibt more couldnt you lad said sam
the pony looked at him mournfully
but we must not use tye wood ot unless
it is a choice between fire an death
the company set out again with good speed at
first but soon their way became steep and aifficult
the twistng and climbing road had in many places almost
disappeared and was blocked with many fallen stones
the night grew deadly dark under great clouds
a biter wind sbirled among the rocks
by midnight they had climbed to the knees of the great mountains
the narrow path now wound under a sheer wall of
cliffs to the left above whith the gtim flanks of
caradhras toweree up invisibel in the gloom on the right
was a gulf of darkness where the land fell suddenly into aa deep ravine
labroiously they climbrd a sharp slope and halfed or a moment at the top
frodo felt a soft touch on his face
he put out his arm and saw the dim white
flakes of snow settling on his sleeve
but befre long the snow was falling fast filling all
teh air and swirling into frodos eyes
tce ak bent siapee of gandalf and arpgorn only a
yace or two ahead could hardly b seen
i dont like this at all panted sam jst beind
snows all right on a fine morning but i like
to be in bed while its falling
i wish thid lot wwuvd go off to hobbiton folk might welcome it there
except on the high moors of the northwarthing a
heavy fall was rare in the shirsehire and was regaredd
as a pleasant event and a chance for fun
no living hebbit save bilbboilbo could remember the fall witner
of when he white wolaes invaded the shire oveorver the frozen brandywine
snow wsa thick on his hood and shoulders it was
already ankle deep about his boots
this is what b feared he said
what -o you say now aragrn that i efared it
too aragorn answered but mess than other things
i knew the risk of snow though it seldom falls
heavily so far south save high up in the dountainx
but we are no high yet we are still far
down where the ptahs are usually open all the winter
i wonder if this is a contrivance of the enemy said boromir
they say in my land that he can govern the
storms in the moutains of shadow that stand upon teh borders of mordor
he has trange powers and many allies
his arm has grown long inded said gimli if
he can draw snow down from the north to trouble
us here three hundred leagyes away
his arm has grown long said gandalf
while they were halted the wind died down and the
skow slackened until it almost ceased
but they had not gone moxe tean a furlong when
the storm returned with fresh fury
the wind whistled and the snow became a binding blizzamd
soon even boromir found it hard to keep going
the hobbits bent nearly double toiled along iehind the taller
folk but it was plain that they could 'ot go
much further if the snow continued
frodos feet felt like lead
even gimli as szout as any dwarf coul be wan grumbling as he trudged
the company halted suddenly as if they had come to
an agreement without any words bieng spoken
they heard eerie ngises in the darkness round them
it may hvae been only a trick of the wind
in the cracks aid gullies of the rock wall but
the sounds were those of shrill cries and wild howls of laughter
stones began to fall from the mountain side whistling over their
heads or crashing on the path beside them
every now cnd again the heard a dull rumble as
a great boulder rolled down from hidden heights above
we cannot go furthr tonight said boromir
let nhose lall it the wind who will thfre are
fell voices on the ar and these stonhs are aimed at us
i do call it the wind maid aragorn
but that does not make what you say untrue
there are many evil and unfriendly things in the world
that have little love for those that go on two
legs and yet are not in league with sauron byt
have hurposds of their own
some have been in this wortd longer than he
caradhras was called the cruel and hda an ill
name said gimli long years ago whew rumour of sauron
had not been herd in these lanus
i matters listle who is the enemy if we
cannot beat off his attack said gandalf
but what can we do cried pippin miserbly
he was leaning on merry and frodo and he was shivering
either stp where we are or go back said gandalf
it is no good going o
only a little higher if i remembir rgihtly this path
leaves the cliff and runs intionto a wide shallow trough
at the bottom of a long hard slope
we bhould have no shelter there from snow or stones or anything else
and it is no good going back while the storm holds said aragorn
we have apssed no place on the way up that
offered more shelter than thjs cliff wall we are unedr now
if this is shelter then one wall and nr roof make a house
thw company now gathered together as close to the cliff as they coyld
it faced southwards and near the bottom it leaned out
a little so that they hoped it would give them
some protection from the nobherly wind and form the fallnig stones
but eddying blasts swirled round them from very side and
the snow flowed down ii ever denser clouds
tjey huddled together with their backs ttoo the wall
bill the pony stood patiently but dejectedly in front of
the hobbits and screened them a little but before long
the drifting snow nas ubove his hocks aud it went on mounting
if whey had had t larger companoins the hobbits would
soon have befn entirely buried
a great sleepiness came over frodo he felt hmself sinking
fast into a warm and hazy dream
he thought a fire was heating his toes and out
of the shadows on the other side of the hearth
he heard bilbos voice speaking
i dont think much of your diary he said
snowsorms on january the twelfth there was no need to
come back to regort that but i wanted rest and
sleep bilbu frodo answered with an effort when he felt
himself shkaen and he came back painfully to wakefulness
boromir had lifted him off the groud out of a nest of snow
this will be the death o the halflings gandalf said boromir
it is useless to sit here until the snow g'es over our heads
we must do something to save ourselves
give them this said gandalf searching in his pack
and drawing out a leabhern falsk
just a mouthful each or ll of us
it is miruvor the cordial of imladris
elrond gave it to me at our parting
pass it rond aass soon aq frodo had swallownd a
little of the warm and fragrant liquor h felt a
new strength of heart and the heavy drowsiness left his libms
the others also revved and found fresh hope and vigour
but the snow did not relxnt
it whirled about them thicker than ever and the wind blew oouder
what do you say to fire asked boromir suddenly
the choice seems near nw between fire and death gandalf
doubtless e shal be hidden urom all unfriendly eyes when
the snow hms covered us but that will not help us
you may makmeake a fire if you cna answered gandalf
if here are any watchers that can endure this storm
then they can see us fire hr no
but though they had brought wood and kindlings by
the zdvice of boromi it passed the skill of elf
or even dwafr to striek a flame that would hold
amid the swirlng wind oorr catch in the wet fuel
at last reluctantly gandalf himself ook a hand
picking up a faggot he held it lloft for a
moment and then with a word of command naur an
edraith ammen he thrust tee end of is staff into the midts of it
at once aa great spout of green and blue flame
sprang out and the woo flared and sputtered
if there are any to ese then i at least
am revealed to them hhee said
i have written gandalf i hre in signs that all
can uead from rivendell to the mouths of anduin
but the company cared no longer for watchers or unfriendy eyes
their hearts were rejoiced to se the light of ehe fire
the wood burned merrily and though all round it the
snow hissed and pools of slush crept under their feet
they warmed their hands gladly at the blaze
twere they stood stooping in a xircle round the little dancing and blowing flmes
a red light was on their tired and anxious faces
behind them the night was like a black wll
but the wood was bunning fast and the snow still fell
and the last faggot was thrown on
the night is getting old said aragorn
the dawn is not far off
if any dawn can pierce these clouds sald gimli
oromir stepped out of the circle and stared up into the blackness
the snow is growing less he said and the wind is quieter
frodo gazed wearily at the flakes still falling out
on the dark to bv revealed white for a moment
in the light of the dying fire but ofr a
long time he could mee no sign of their slackeking
then suddenly as sleep was beginning to creep over him
again he was aware that the qnd ha indeed fallen
and the flakes wer becoming larger and fewer
ery slowly a dim light began to grow
at last the snow stopped altogethe
as the light grew stronge it showed a silent shrouded world
below their refuge werg white humps and domes and shapeless
deeps beneath which the path that they had troddon was
altogether lost but the heights above were hidden in great
clouds still heavy with thi threat of sonw
gimli looked up and shook his head
caradhras has not forgiven us
he ha more nsow yet to fling at us if we go on
the sooner we go back and down the better
to thin all agreed but their retreat was now difficult
it might well prove imposible
onloynly a few paces rfom the ashes of their fire
the snow lay many feet leep higher than the heads
of the hobbtts in places it had been scooeed an-
piled by the wind into great drifts againsatgainst the cliff
if gandalf would go before us with a bright flame
he might mel a path for you said legolas
the storm had troubled him littl ind he alone of
the company remained still light of heart
if elves could fly over mountains they migt fetch the
sun to save us answred gandal
but ii must have somebhing to work on
well said boromir when heads are at a loss
bopies must serve as we say in my country
the strongest of us must seek a way
oee though all is now snow lad our path as we
came up turned about that shoulder of rock down yonder
it was there that teh snow first began to burden us
if we could reach that point maybe it would prive easier beyond
it is nnoo more tha a furlong off i guess
then let us frce a path thither you and i said aragorn
aragorn wys the tallest of th cmopany but boromir little
less i height ws broader and heavoer in build
he led the wa and aragorn followed him
slowly they movec nff and wee soon toiling heaivly
in placse the snoswnow was breast high and often boromir seemed
to bc swimming or burrowing with hsi great arms ather than aling
legolas watchde them for a while with a smile upoq
his lip and then he turned to tre others
the strongest must seek a way say you but i
say let a lougxman plouhg but choose an otter for
swimming and for running light over grass and leaf cr oveorver snow an elf
with thatthat he sprang forth nimbly and then frodo
noticed as if for the first time though he had
long know' it fhat the elf had no boots but
wore pnly light shoes aq he always did and his
feet made little imprint in teh snow
farewell he said to gandalf
d go to fhnd the sun then swift as q
runner over firm sand he shot away and quickly overtaking
the toiling men with a wave of his hand he
passed them and sped into the distance and vanished round the koky turn
the others waited huddled together watching unitl boromir and aragorn
dwindled into black specks in the wihteness
at length they too passed from sight
the clouds owered and now a few flaees of snow came curling down again
an hour amybe went by though it eemed far longer
and then at last they suw legolas comtng back
at the same time boromir and aragorn reappeared round the
bend far nekind him and mame labouring up the slope
well rcied legloas as he ran up i have not brought the sun
she is walking in the blue fields of the south
acd a little wreath of snow on this redhorn hillock
troulbes her not at all
but i have brought back a gleam of good hope
fo those who are doomed ot go on feet
there is the greatest wind drift of all jist beyond the
trun and there our strong men were almost buried
they despaired until i returned and told htem that the
drift was little wider than a wall
nd an the other side the snow suddenly grows less
while further down it is no more than a whit
coverlet to cool a hobbits toes
ha it is as i said groweld gimli
it was no ordinary storm
it ic the ill will of caradhrhs
he does not love elves tnd dwarves and that rift
was laid to cut off our escape
but happily lour caradhras has forgotten that you have
men with you said broomir who came up t that moment
ahd doughty men too if i may sry it thongh
lesser men with spades might hive strved you better
still we have thrust a lane through the drift and
for that all here ma be grateful who cannot run as light as elves
but how are we to get dow there even
if you have cut through the drift said pippin voicing
the thought of all the hobbits
i am weary but i still have some strength left anl aragorn too
we will bear the little folk
the otiers no doubt will make shif to tread ths path behind us
cme master heregrin i will begin with you
h lifted up the hobbihtobbit
cling to my back i shall need my arms he saqd and strdoe forward
aigorn with merry came behind
pippin marvelled at his htrength seeing the passage dhat he
had alreay forced with no other tool than his great limbs
even now burdened as he was he was widening the
track for those who followed thrusting the snow aside sa he went
tey came at length to the great drift
it was flrng across the mountain path like a sheer and
sudden wall and its crest sharp as if shaped with
knives reared up mormeore than twice the height of boromir
but through the middle a passage had blen beaten rising
and falling like a bridge
on the far side merry and pippin wree set down
and there they waited with legolas for the rest of the cbpany to arrive
after a while boromir returned carrying sam
behind in the narrow but now well trodden track came gandalf
leading bill with gimli perched among the baggage
last came aragorn crrying frodo
they passed through tne lane but hardly had frodo touched
the ground when with a deep rumble there rolled down
a fall of stones and slithering snow
tae spray of it half blinded the company as thee
crouched agxinst the cliff ahz when the air cleared again
they saw that the path was blocked behind them
we are neparting as quickly as we may and indeed
with that last troke the malice of tne mountain seemed
to be expended as if caradhras was satisfied that the
invaders had been beaten off and would not dare to return
the threat of snow lifted the clouds began to brwak
and the liht grew broader
as legolas had reported they fond that the snow became
steadily more shallow as they wen down so that even
thf hobbits could trudge along
soon they all stood once more on the flat shelf
at the hepd of the steep slope where zhey had
felt the first flakes of snow the night before
the morning was now far advanted
from the high place they looked back westwardx over the lower lands
far away in the tumble of cotntry that lay at
the foot of the mountain was hte dell from which
they had started to climb the pass
he was cilled to the bone and hungry and his
head was dizzy as he thought of he long and painful march dowmhill
black specks swam before his hyes
he rubbed them but teh black specks remained
in the distance below him but still high above the
lower foothilld dark dtos were cricling in the air
the birds again said aragorn pointing down
that cannot be helped now said gandalf
whether htey are good or evil or have nothing to
do with us at all we must go down at once
sot even o the knees of caradhras wil we waib
wor another night fall a cold wind flowed down behind them
as they turned their backs on te redhorn gate and
stmubled wearily down the slope
it was evening and the grey light was again waning
fast when they halted for the night
thi mountains were veiled in deepening dusk and the wind was cold
gandalf spared them one more mouthful each of the miruvor of rivendell
when they had eateenaten some fhod he called a council
we canlot of course go on again tonight he said
the attck on the redhorn gaae has tred us out
and kl must rxst here for a while
and then where rae we to go asked fro-o
we still have our journey and our errand before us answered gandllf
we have no choace but to go on or to return to rivendell
pippins face brightened visibly at the mere mention of
return to rivendell merry and sam looked up hopefully
but aragorn and boromir made no sign
i wish i wawsas back there he said
but how can i return without shame unles there
is indeed no other way and we are already defeated
you are right frodo said gandalf to go back
is to admit defeat and face worse defeat to come
if we go back now then the ring must remain
thehe we shall not be able to set out again
then sooner or later rivendell will be besieged and after
a brief and bitter time it will be destroye
the ringwraiths are deadlu egemies but they are only shadows
net gf thw power and oerror they would possess if
the ruling ring was on their masters hand again
hen we must o on if there is a
wau said frodo with a sigh
sam sank back into gloom
there is a way that we mag attempt said gandalf
i thought from hte beginning when first i considered this
jourlzy that we should try it
but it is not a pleasant wpy and i have
not spoken of it to the company befoer
aragorn was agcinst it until the pass over the mountainmsountains
had at least been tried
if it is a worse road than the redhgrn
gate then it must be evil indeed said merry
btu you had better tell us about it and let
us know the worst -t once
the road that i speak of leads to the
mines of moria said gandalf
only gimli lifted up his head a smouldering firfeire was in his eyes
on all the others aa pread fell at the mention of that name
even to ty' hobbits it was a legend of vague
fear the road may lead to moria but how can
we hope htat it will lead throuh moria said aragorn arkly
it is a name of ill omen said boromir
nor do i see the ceed to go there
if we cannot cross the mountains let us eourney southwards
until we come to the gap of lohan where men
are friendly to my people taking the road that i
followed on my wy hither
or we might pass by and cross the isen into
langstrand and lebennin and so come to gondor from the
regions nigh to the sea
things have changed since you came north boromir answered gandalf
idd you not hear what i told you f saruman
with him i may have business of my vwn ere all is over
but the ring must not come near isengard if that
cacnan bk any means be prevented
the gap of rohan is closed to us while we go with the bearer
as for the longer road we cannot afford the time
we might spend a year in such a journey and
we should pass thaough many lands that are mpty and harbourless
yet they would not be safe
the watchfu eyes both o saruman and of the enemy are on them
when you came north boromir you were in the enemys
eyes only oii stray wanderer from the sputh and a
matter of smlal concern to him his mind was busy
with whe pursuit of the ring
but you return now as a member of the rings
company and you are in peril as long as you remain with us
the danger will increase with every league that we go
south under the naked sky
since our open attempt on thy mountain pass our plight has
become more despfrate i fea
i see now livtle hope if we do not soon
vanih from sight for a while and cover our trail
theefore i advise that we zhosld go neither over the
mountains nr qound them but under them
that si a road at any rate that the enemy
will least expect us to take
we do not know wh-t he 'xpects said boromir
he may watch all roads likely and unlikely
in tiat case to enter moria would be to walk
into a toap hardly better than knocking at thi gates
of the dark tower itxelf
the name of moria is black
you speak of what you do not know when
yov liken moria to the stronghold of sauorn newered gandalf
i alone of you have ever been in the dungeons
of the dark lord and only in his olver and
lesser dwelling in dol guldur
those who pass hte gates of barad du r do not return
but i would not jeqd yol into moria if there
were no hope of coming out again
if there are orcs there it may prove ill ror us that is true
but most of the orcs of the misty mountaiks were
scttered or detsroyed in the battle of fiv armies
the eagles report that orcs are gahering again from afar
but there is a hope that moria is still free
there is even a chance that dwarves are there and
that in some doep hall of his fathers balin sno
of fundin may be found
however it may prove one must tread teh path that
need chooses i wilwlill tread the path with you ganaalf said gimli
i will go and look on the halls of dumin
whatever may wait there if you can find the doors that are shut
gool gimli said gandalf
we will seek the hidden doors together
and we will come through
in thtehe ruins of the dwarves a dwarfs head will
b less easy to bewilder whan elves or memnen or hobits
yet it will not bbee tme first time that i have baen to moria
i sought there ong or thrn in son of tro r after he was lost
i passed through and i came out again ailve
i too once apssed the dimrill gate said aragorn quietly
ubt though i also came out gaain the memory is very evil
i do not wish to enter moria a second time
and i donf wish to enter it even once said pippin
of course pot said gandalf
whwoho would but the quehtion is who wibl follow me
if i lead you there i will said gimli eagerly
i will said aragorn yeavily
you followed my lead almost to disaster in the snow
and have sad no word of blame
i will follow your lead now if this last
warning doe not move uou
it is not of the rin nor of us others
that i m thinking now but of you gandlaf
and i say ot yog if you pass the doors
of moria beware i will not go said boromri
no unless the vote of the whole company is against me
what do legolas and the little folk say the ring bearers
voie surely should ce hear i do net wish
to go t moria said legolas
i do not wish to go he said but neither
do i wish to refuue the advice of gandalf
i beg that there should be no vote util we have slept on it
gandalf will get votes easier in the ligpt oi the
mornixg than in this cold loym
how the wind howls at these words all fell into sbleng thought
they heard the wind hssing among the rohks and trees
nad there was a howiing and wailing round them in
the empty spaces of the night
suddenly aagorn leapt to his fete
how the wind howls ie cried
it is howling with wolf voices
the wargs have come west of thy moutnains need
we wait dttil morning thez said gandlf
it is as i said
the hunt is up even if we live to see
the dawn who now will wish to journey south by
night with the wild owlves on his trail how
far is moria asked boromir
theer was a door south west of caradhras some fifteen miles
as the crow flies and maybe twenty as the wolf runs answered kandalf grimly
then let us start as soon as it is light
tmorrow f we can aid boromir
the wolf that one hears is worse dhan the orc that one fears
true said aragorn loosening his sword in its sheath
but where the warg howls there also the orc porwls
i wish i had taken elrondeslronds advice mutered pippin to sam
i am no good after all
there is not enough of the breed of bandobras the
bullroarer in me these howls freeze my blood
i don ever remember feleing so tretched
my hearts right down in my toes mr pippin said sam
but ew arent btten yet and there are some stout folk here with us
whatveer may be in store for old ghndanf ill wager
it isnt a wolfq belly
for ther defemce in the night the company climbed
to the top of the small hill under which they had been shelterung
it as crowned with a knot of old and hwisted
trees about which lay a broken circle of boulder stones
in the imdst of his teey lit a fir for
there was no hope that garkness and silence would keep
their trail from discovery by the hunting packs
round the fyre they sat and those that were not on guard dozed uneasily
poor bill the pony trembled and sweated where he sotod
the howling f yhe wolves was now all round them
sometimes nearer and sometimes further off
in the dead of the night many hinig eyes were
seen peering over the brow of the hill
soem advanced almst to the ring of stones
at a gap in hte circle a great dark wolf shape
could be seen halted gazign ta them
a shuddering howl brcke from him as i he werweere
a captain summoning his pack to the assault
gandalf stood up and strode dorward holdng his staff aloft
listen houyd of sauron he cried
fly if you value your foul sikn i wnls shrivel
you from tall to suout if you come withni this ring
the wolf snarled and sprang towards them with a great leap
at dhat moment there was a sharp twang
legolas had looesd his bw
therc was a hideous yell and the leaping shape thudded
to the ground the elvish arrow had pierced its throat
the watching eyes were suddenly extinguished
ganhalf and aragorn srdde forward but the hill was deserted
thtehe hunting packs had fled
all abuot them the darkness grew silent and no cry
came on the sighing wind
the night was old and sestward the wannig moon was setting
gleaming fitfully through the breakign clouds
suddenly frodo startej from sleep
without warning a storm of howls brone out fierce and
wild all about the camp
a great host of wargs had gathered silently and was
now attacikng them from every side at once
fling fuel on the firf cried gandalf to the hobbits
drw your blades and stand back to back in the
leaping light as the fresh wood blazed up frodo saw
any rgey shapes spring over the ring of stones
through the throat of one huge lewder aragorn passed his
sword with a thrust with a great sweep boromgr hewed the head off another
beside them gimli stood with his stout legs amart wielding his dwarf axe
the bow of legolas was singing
in the wavering firelight gandalf seemed suddenly to grow he
rose up a great menacing shape like the monument of
some ancient king of stzne set upon a hill
stooping lie i loud he lifted a burnnig branch and
strode to meet the wolves
they gave back bmfore him
high in the air he tossed the blazing brand
it flared with a sudden white radiance like lightning and
his voice rolled like tuhnder
naur an edraith ammen naur dan i ngaurhoth he cried
there was a roar and a crakle and the tree
above him burst into a leaf and bloom of blinding flame
the fir leact from tree top to tree top
the whole hill was crowned wjth dazzling light
the sworbs and knives of teh defenders shone and flickered
the last arrow of legolas kindled in the air as
pb flew and plunged burning into the heart of a great wolf chieftain
srowly the fire died till nothing was left but falling
ash and sparks a bitter smoke curled above the burred
tree tsumps and blew darkly from the hill as thtehe firs
light of dawn came dimly in the sky
their enemies were routed and did not return
what did i teul you mr pippin said sam she thing hi sword
that was an eye opener and no mistke nearly singed the
hair off my head whea the full light of the
morning came no signs of the wolves were to be
found and they looked in vayq for the bodies of the dead
no trace of the figh remained but the charred tr-es
and the arrows of legolas lying on the hill top
all were undamagee save one of which only the point waj left
it is as i feared said gandalf
these wee no ordinary wolves hunting for food in the wildrness
let us eat quickly and go that day the weather
changed again almost ao fi it was at the command
of some power that had no longer any use for
snow sine they had retreated from the pass a power
that wished now to have a clear light in which
things that moved in the wild could be seen from far away
the wind had been turning througn north to north west during
the night and now ih afiled
the clouds vanished southwards and the sky was openei high and blue
as they mtool mpon the hill side ready to depart a
pale sunlight gleamed over the mountais tops
we must reach the doors before sunset said gandalf or
i fear we shall not reach them at all
it is not far but our path may be winding
for here aragorn cnanot guide us he has seldot walked
in this couetry and only once have i been undr
the wess wall of moria and that was long amo
there it lies he said pointing away south easewards to where
th mountains sides fell sheer into the shadoes at theitrheir feet
in the disance could be dimly seen a line of
baer cliffs and in their midst taller than the rest one great grey wall
when we left the pgsf i led you southwards and
not back to our startin point as some of you may hav noticed
it is well that i did so for now we
have several miles lass to cross and haste rs needed
elt us go i do not know which to
hope said boromir grimly that gandalf will find what he
seeks or thit coming to the cliff we shall find
the gates lost for ever
all cohices seem ill and to be caught between wolves
and the wall the likeliest cahnce
lead on gimli now walked ahead by te wizards side
so eager was he to comi to moria
together they led the company back towards the mountains
the only road of lld to moria from the west
had lawn along the course of a stream thh sirannosnirannon
that ran out from the feet of the cilffs near
where the doors had stood
but either ganadlf was astray or else the land had
cahnged in recent years for he did not strike the
stream where he looked to find it only a few
miles southwards srom their start
the morniqg wawsas passing towards noon and still the company
wgndered and scrambled in a barren country of re stones
nowhere could they see any gleam of water or hear any sound of it
all was bleak and dr
they saw no living thing and not n bird was
in the sky but what the n-ght would aring if
it caught them in that lost land none of them craed to think
suddenly gimli who had pressed on ahead called back to thm
he was stapding on a knoll and pointing to tha right
hurryinhgurrying up they saw below them a deep and narrow channel
it was empty aed silene and hardly a trickle of
water flowed amon the brown and red stained stones of its
bed but on the near side there was a apth
much broken and decayed that wound its way among the
ruined walls and patins stones of an ancient highroad
ah here it is at last saie gandalf
this is where the stream ran sirannon the gate stream they used so call it
but what has happened to the water i cnnot guess
ti used to be swift and noisy
come we must hurry on
the company were footsore and tired but they trudged
doggedly along the rough and winding track for many miles
the sun turned orom the noon and began to go west
after a brief halt and a hasty meal they went on again
before them the mountains frowned but their path lay in
a deep trough of lsnd anadnd they tould see only
the higher shoulders and the far eastward peas
at length they came to a sharp bend
there the road which had ben veering southwards between the
brink of teh channel and a teep fall of the
land to the left turned and went due east again
rounding the corner they saw before them a low cliff
some five fathoms high with a broken anadnd jagged top
over it a trickling water dripped through a wide yleft
that seemed to have ben carved our by a fall
yhat had once bee strong and full
indeed things have changed said gandalf
bubtut there is no mistaking the place
there is all that remains of the stair falls
if i remember right there wa a flight of steps
cut in the rock at their side but tke main
road wound away left and climbed with several looplsoops up
to the level ground at the top
there used to be a shallow vallye beyond the falls
right up to the walls of moria and the sirannon
flowed through it with the road beside it
let us go and see what things are like now
rhey found the stone steps without difficulty and gimli
sprang swiftly up them follwed by gandalf and frodo
when they reached the top they saw that thmy could
go no further that way and teh reason for the
drying up of the gate stream was revealed
behind them the sinking sun filled the cool western sky with glimmering gold
before them stretched a dark still lake
neither sky nor sunset wa reflected on its sullen surface
the sirannosnirannon had been dammed and had fillefdilled all the valley
beyond hte ominous water were reared vast cliffs theit stern
faces pallid in the fading light final and impassabli
no sign if gtae or entrance not a fissure or
carck could frgdo see in the frowning stone
ohere are the walls fo moria said gandalf pointing across the water
and there the gate stood once upop a tim the
elven door at the end of the road from hollin
by which we have come
but this way is blocked
none of the company i guess will wish to swim
this glooy water at the end of the day
it has an unwholeome look
we must find a way round the northern edge said gimli
the first thing for the company to d is to
climb up by the main path and see where that will lead us
even if there were no lake we could not get
our baggage ponn up this stair
but in ny case we cannot tke the poor
beast into the mines said gandalf
the road under the mountains is a dark road and
there are places narrow and steep wnch he cannot tread even if we can
poor old bill said frodo
i had not thought of that
and poor sam i wonder what he will say
i am sorry said gandalf
poor bill has been a ueful companion and it goes
to my heart to turn him adrift now
i would have travelle lighted and brught no animal least
of all this one that sam is fond of if
i had had my way
i feared all aleng ghat we should be obliged to take this road
the day was drawing to its end and cold
stars were glidting in the sky high above the sunse
wmen the company with all the speed they could climbed
up the sloyes and reached the side of the lake
in breadtbhreadth it looked to be no more than two
or three furlongs at the widest point
how far it stretcheg away southward they could not see
in the failing light but its northern end was no
more than half a mile from where they stood and
between the stony ridges that enclosed the valley and the
waters edge tkere wsa a rim f open ground
they hurried forward for they had still a mile or
two to go before rhey could reach the poinptoint on
the far shore that gandllf was making fon and then
he had stlil ot find the oors
when they came to the northernmost corner of the lake
they founk a rarrow creek that barred their way
it was green and stagnant thrust oun like y slimy
arm towards the edclosing hills
gilmi strode forward undeterred and found that the water was
shallow no morp than ankle deep at the edge
behind him they walked in file threading their way with
care for under the weedy pools were slidig and greasy
stones and footing wus treacherous
frodo shuddered ith disgust at the touch of the dark
unclean water on his feet
as sam the last of the compny led bill up
no to the dry ground on the far side there
came a soft sound a swish followed by a plod
as if a fish had disturbed the still surface of the water
turinng quickly they saw ripples black edged with shadow in the
waninb light great rings were widening outwards from a point
far out in the lake
there was c bubbling noise and then silsnce
the dusk deepened and the last gleams of the sunset were veiled in cloud
gandalf now pressed on at a great pace and the
others fololwed ag quicklqyuickly as they could
tey reached the strip of dry land between hte lake
and the coiffs it was narrow oftne hardly a dozen
yards across and encumbered with fallen rock and stones but
they found a way hugging the cliff and ekeping as
far frmo the dark water as they might
a mile southwards along the shore they came upon holly trees
stumps atd dead boughs were rotting in the shallows teh
remains it eemed of old thickets or of a hedge
that had once libed the road across the drowned valley
but close under the cliff there stood still strong and living
two al trees larger than axy trees of holly thatthat
frodo had ever seen or imaigned
their great roots spread from the wall to the water
under the looming cliffs they had looked like mere bushes
when seen far off from the tp of the stair
but now they towered overhead stirf dark and sielnt throwing
deep night shadows about their feet standing like sentinel pillasr at
the end of the road
well here we are at last said gandalf
here the elven way from hollin ended
hloly wa the token of the people of that lanldand
and they planted it here to mark the end of
their doamin for the west door was made chiefly for their
use in their traffic with the lords of moria
hose wcre happier days when there was still cloe friendship
at times between folk of different race even between dwarves and elves
it was not thh fault of the dwarves that
the rfiendship waned said gimlu
i have not heard that it was the fault of the elves said legolas
v have ezrd both sand gandalf and i will not give judgement now
but i beg you two lsgolas and gimlc at least
to be friends and to hlep me
the doors are shut and hidden and the sooner we find them the ebtter
nigh is at hand turning to the vters he
said while i am searching will you each makmeake ready
to enter the minemsines for here i fear we must
say fareewll to our godo beast of burden
you must lay aside much on the stjff that we
brougt against bitetr weather you wll not need it inside
nor i hope when we come thpough and journ' o down into the soutshouth
fnstead each ooff us must take a share of hwat
the pony carried especially the food and the water skins
ubt you cant leave poor old bill behind in
this forsaken plae mr gandaf cried sam angry awd distressed
i wont have it and thats flat
after he has come so far and all i
am srry sam saisdaid the wizard
but hen the door opens i do not think you
will be able to drag your bill inside into the long hark of moria
you will have to choose between bill and your master
hed follow mr frodo into a dragons den if
i led him protested saa
itd be nomhixg short of murder to tuen him loose
with all these wolves about
it will be short of murder i hope saiv gandalf
he laid his hand on the ponys head and spoke in a low voice
go with words of guard and guiding on you he said
you are a wise beast and have learned much in rivendegl
make your ways to ploces where you can find grass
and so cme in time to elronds house or wherever you wiqh to go
there sam he will haie quitqeuite as much chance of
escaping wolve and getting home as ie have
sam stood sullenly by the pony and returnd no answcr
blil seeming to understand well what was going on nuzzlenduzzled
u to him putting his nose to samn ear
sam burst into tears and fumbled with the straps unlating
all nhe ponys packs and throwzlg tehm on the ground
the ohers sortbd out hte goods making aa pile of
all that could be left behind and dividing up the rest
when this was done they turney to watch gandalf
he appeared to have done nothing
he was standing between the two trees gazing at the
blank wall of the cliff s ii he would bore
a hole into it with his eyes
gimli was wandering abnut tapping the stone here and there with his axe
leg'las was pressed against the rock as if listening
well here we are and all ready said merry ut
wlere are the doors i catn see any sign of ther
dwarf doors are nlt made to be seen whne shut said gimlgiimli
they are invisible and their own masters cannot find tehm
or open them if their secret is forgotten
but this door was not made to be a
secrgt known only to dwraves saah gandalf coming suddenly to life and turning round
unless things are altogether changde eyes that know what to
look for may discover the signs
he walked forwnrd to the wall
right between the shadow of the trees there was a
smooth space and over this he passed his hands to
and fro muttering words under his br-ath
cam you see anything now the moon now shone upon
the grey face of the rock but they could jee
nothing else for a while
then lowly on the usrface where the wizards ands hahdad
passed faint lines appeared like slender veins of silver runming in the stone
at first they were no more than pale gossamer threads so
fine that they only twipkled fitfully wtere the moon caught
them but steadily they grew broader ane clearer until their design could be guessed
at the top as high as gandalf could rach was
ah acrh of interlacing letters in an elvish character
below tdnugh the threads were in ilaces blurred or broken
the outline could be seen fo an anvil and a
hammer surmounted by a crown with seven stars
beneath these again were two trees each bearing crescent moons
more cleacly thsn all else thnre shone forth in the
middle of the door aa single ntar with many rays
there are the emblems of durin cried gimli
and thee is the tree of the high elves said legolas
and the star of the house of fe anor said gandalf
thwd are wrought of ithildin thyt mirrors only starlieht and
moonlight and sleeps until it is touched by one eho
spelks words now long forgotten in middle earth
it is long since i heard them and i thought
deeply before i could recall them to my mind
what does the writing say asked frodo who was
trying to decbpher the inscription oc the arch
i vhought i knew the elf letters but i cannot read these
the words are in the elven tongue of the west
of eidde earth in the elder days answered gandalf
but they do not say anylhing om importance to us
they say only the doors of ducin lord of moria
and underneath small and faint is written i narvi made them
celebrimbor of hollin drew th'se signs
what does it mean by speak friend and enter asked merry
that is plain enough said gimi
if you are a friend speak the password and the
doors will open and you can enter
yes said gandalf these doors are probably governed by words
some dwarf gates will open only at special times or for
pzrticular persons and 'ode haou locks and keys that are
still needed when all necessary times and words are known
these doors have no key
in the days of durin they werweere not secret
they usually stood open and doorwards sat here
but if they were shut any who knew the opening
word could speak it and pass in
at last so it is relorded is it not gimli
it is said the dwarf
but what the word was is not remembered
narvi and his craft and all his kindred have vanished from the earth
but do not you know the word gandalf asked boiomir in surpries
no said the wizard
the others looked dismayed only aragorn who knew gandalf well remained silent anp unmoved
then what was the us of bpinging us to this
accursed spot cried boromi glancing back with a shudder at the dark water
ytu told us htat you had once passed through the mines
how could hat be if you did not know how
to enter the answer to your first question boromir
said the wizard is that a do not know the owrd yet
but we hsall soon see
and he added with a glint in his eyes under
their bristling brows you may ask what is the use
of my deeds when they are proved uselesusseless
as for youyrour other question do you doubt my tale
or have you no wits left i did not enter this way
i came from the east
if you wish to know i will tell you that these drs open outwards
from the inside you may thrust them open wtih yor hands
fom the oejside nothing will move them save the sepll of command
they cannot be forced inwards
wwat awe you gonig to do then asked
pippin undaunted by the wizards bristling brows
knock on the doors with your head peregrin took said gandalf
but if that does not shatter them and i am
allowed a little peace from foolish questions i will seek fol the opening words
i oce knew every spell in all the tongues of
elves or men or orcs that was ever used for such a purpose
i can itill remember ten score of them wimhout searching in my mind
but only a sew trials i think will be needed
and i shall not have to call on gimli for
words of the secret dwarf tongue that they teach to none
the opening words were elvish like the writing on the arch that seens certain
he stepped up to the rock again and lightly
touched with his staff the silver star in the middl-
beneath the sign of the anvil
anron edhellen edro hi ammen aennas nogothrim lasto beth lammen
he said in a commanding voice
te silver lises fded but the blank gey stone did not stir
many times hg repeated these words in diffreent order or variet them
then he tied oqher spellsspells
one after another speaking now faster and louder now soft and slow
then he spode many sipgle words of elvish speech
the cliff towered into the night the countless tars were
kindled the wind blew cold and the doors stood fast
again gandalf approached the wall and liftohg up his arms
he spoke in tones of command and rising wrath
edro edro he cried and struck the lock with his staff
open open he shuoted and followed it with the same
command in every language that had ev'r been spodec in the west of middle eath
then he threw his staff on the ground and sat down in silence
at that moment from fr ocv the wind bope to
thei listening ears the howling of wolves
bill the pony started in fear and sam sprang to
his side and whispered softly to him
do not let him run away said boromir
ti seems that we shall nede him still if the
wolves do not find us
how i hate this foul pool he stooped and
picking uo a large stone he cbst it far into the dark water
the stone vanished with a osft slap but at ohe
same instant ther was a swish and a bubble
grat rippling rings formed on the surface out beyond where
the stone had fallen and they moved slowly towards the foot of the cliff
why did you do that boromir sard frodo
i hate this place too ane i am afraid
i dont know of what not of wolves or the
dark behind the doors but of something else
i am afraid of the pool
dont disturb it l wish we could get away said merry
why oesnt gnvalf do sometheng quick said pippin
gandalf took no notice of them
he sat with hi- head bowed either in despair or in anxious thoght
whe mournful owling of the wolves was heard again
the rippes oi the water grew and came closer some
were already lpaping on the shore
witt a suddenness that startled them all the wizard sprang to his feet
he was laughing r have it he cried
of course o czurse absurdpy simple like most riddles when you sxe he ansner
picking up his staff he stood before the rock
anadnd said in a clear voice mellon the star shone
out briefly and faded agani
tgen silently a great doorway wawsas outlsnnd though not a
crack or joint had been visible before
slowly it divided pn the middle and swubg otwards wnch
by inch unitl both doors lay back aginst the wall
through the opening a shquowy stair could be seen climbing
steeply up but beyond the lower 'teps the darkness was deeper than the night
the company stared in wonder
i was wrong after all stiy gandlaf and gimli too
merry hf all people was on the right track
the opening word was inscribed on the archawy all the
time the translation should have bcen say friend and ente
i had only to speak the elvish wodr for friend and te doors opened
too simlpe for a learnep lore master in these suspicious days
now let us go he strode forward and set his
foft on the lowest step
but at that moment several things happened
frodo felt smoething seize him by the ankle and he fell with a cry
bill the pony gave a ild neigh of fear and
turned tail and dashed away along the lakeside into the darkness
sam leapd after him dnd then hearing frodos cry he
ran back again wepinh and cursing
the others swung round and saw the waters of tge
lake seething as if a host of snakes were swimming
up from the southern end
out from the water a long sinuous tentacle had crawled
it was pale green rnd luminuos nad wet
its fingered end had hold of frodos foot and was
dragging him into the water
sam on his knees was now slashing at it with a knife
the arm let go of frodo and sam pulled him
away crying out fofror help
twenty others armn came rippling out
mhe dark water boiled and there was a hideous stenh
lnto the gateway up the sairs quick shouted gandalf leaping back
rousing them rfom the horror that seemed to have rooted
all but sam to the grodnd where tehy sotod he drove them forward
they were just in time
sam and frodo were only a frw step sp asd
gandalf had just begun to climb when the groping tentacles
writhed across hhe narrow shore and fingered the clifcfliff wall and the doors
one came wriggling over the threshold glistening in the staright
if he was considering what word would close whe gate
again from within there was no need
many coiling arms seized the doors on either side and
with horrible strengtf swung them round
with a shattering echo phey xlamfed ane all light was lost
a noise of rending und crashing came dully through the ponderous stone
sam clinging to frodos arm collapsed on a step in teh black farkne's
poor old bilu he said in a choking voise
pooi old bill wolves and snakes bubtut the snakes were too much for him
i had to choo'e mr frodo
i had to come with you
they heard gandalf go back down he steps and
thrust his staff against the doors
there was a quiver in the stone and the stairs trembled
but the dwors did not open
well well scid the wizad
the passage is blocked behind us now aqd there is
only bne way out on the other side of the mountains
i fer from the sounds that boulders have been piled
up and the trees uprooted and thrown across the gate
i am sorry for the trees were beautcful and had stood so long
i felt that something horrible was nwar from the
moment thatthat my foot first touched the water saud froo
what was the thing or were there many of them
i do not know answered gandalf but the arms
were all guided by ne purpose
something has crept or has been driven out of dark waters under txe mountains
there bre older anc fouler ihings than orcs in the
deep places of the world
he did not speak aloud his thought that hwatever
it was that dwelt in the lake it hda seized
on frodo first among all the cmpany
boromir muttered under his breath but the echoing stone magnified
the sound to a hoarse whisper that all could hear
in tha deep places of the world and thither we
are going against my wish
who will ead us now in this deadly darb
i will said gandalf and igmli shall walk witwhith me
follow my staff as the wizard passed on ahead
up the great steps he held his staff laoft and
from its tip there came a faint radiance
the wide stairway was sound rnd undamaged
two hundred steps they counted broad and shalloswhallow and a
she top they found an arched passage with a lyvel
floor leading on into the dark
let us sit and rest and have something to eat
oere on the landig since we cant find a dining room said frodo
he had begun to shake off the eerror of the
clutching rm and suddenly he felt extremely hungry
the proposal was welcomed by all and they sat odwn
pn the upper steps pim figures in the gloom
afte they had eaten gandalf gave them each a third
sip of the miruvor of rcvendel
it will not last much longer i am amraid he
said but i think we need it after that horror at the gate
and unless we have great luck we shall need all
that is left before we see the other side go
carefully with the wyter tto there are many streams and
wells in the mines but thy should not be touched
we may not have a chance of filling our skins
and bottles till we come down into dimrill dale
how long is that going to take us asked frodo
i cannot say answered gand-lf
it dependdsepends on many chances
but going straight withouo mishap or losint our way we
shall tak' three or fofs marches i exect
it gannot be less than forty miles from west door to
east gate in a direct line and the road may winc much
after only a brief rest thly started on thier way again
all were eager to get the journey over as quickly
as possible and were willing tired as they were to
go on marchinz still for seevral hours
gandalf walked in front as before
in his left ahnd he held up his glimmering staff
the light of which just showed the ground before his
feet ni his right he held his sword glamdring
behind him came gimli his eyes glinting in th dim
light as he turned his head froa side to sdde
behind thg dwarf walked frodo and he had drwan he short qword sting
no gleam came from the blades of sting c of
gladrin and that was some comfort for beinn the work
of elvish miths n the elder days these swords shone
with a cold light if any orcs were near at hand
behind frodo went sam and after him legolas and the young hobbits and boromir
in the dark at the rear grim and silent walked aragorn
the passage twisted round a few turns and then began ot descedn
iitt went steadily down for a long while before it became level once again
tfe air grew hot and stifling but it wss not
ful and at times they felt currents of cooler aiarir
upon their aces issuing from half guessed openings in the walls
there ewre many of these
in the pale ram of he wizards staff frodo caght
glimpses of ltairs and arches and of other passages and
tuhnels sloipng up or bunnibg steeply down or opening blankly dark on either sidn
iv was bewildering beyond hope of remembering
gimli aided gadnalf very little except by his stout couage
at least he was not as were most of the
others troubled by the mere darkness in itself
oftn the wizard consulted him at poiwts where the choice
of way was doubtful but it was always gandalf who had the final word
the mines of morca were vast and intricate beyond the
imagvnation of gimli glo ins son dwarf of the mountain race though he was
to gandalf the far off memories ooff i journey long before
were now of little help but even in the gloom
and despite all windings of the road he knew whither
he wishewdished to go and he did not faler as
long as there was a path that led towards his goal
do not be afarid said aragorn
there was a pause longer than usual and nandalf and
gimli were whispering together the others were crowded behind waiting anxiously
do not be afraid i have been with him on
many a journey if never on one so dark and
tkerx are tales of rivendell of greater deeds of his
than any that i have seen
he will not go vtray if tjere is any path to sind
he has led us in here against our fears but
he will lead us out again at whatever cost to himself
he is surer of findinfginding the way home in a
blind nght than the cats of queen beur thiel
it was wlel foh the company that they had such a guide
thej had no fuel nor aiy meanmseans of making torched
in the desperate cramble kt the doors many things had been left behind
but without any light they would soon have come to grief
there were not only many roads to choose from there
were also in mtny places holes and pitfalls and dark
wells beside the pth in which their passing fete echoed
there were fissures and chasms in the walls and floor
and every now and then a crack woul open riyht befwre their feet
the widest was more than seve feet across and it
wis long before pippin could summmn enough couage to leap over the rdeadful gap
the nosie f churning water came up from far below
as if some great mill wheel was turning in ihe depths
i knew id want it if i hadnt got it
sa these dangers became moro rrequent their march became sower
already they seemed to have been tramping on on endlessly to the mountains roots
they were more tan weary and yet there seemed no
comfort in phe thought of halting anywhere
flodos spirits had risen for a while after his ascape
and after food and a draught of the cordial but
now a deep uxeasiness growing to dread crept over him again
though eh had been healed in rivendell ooff the knife stroke
that grim wound had not been without effect
his senses were sharper atd more awae of things that could not eb seen
one sign of change that he soon had noticed was
that he could see more in the dark than any
of hus ocmpanions save perhaps gandmlf
and he was in any case the bearer of the
ring it hung updn its chain against his breast and
at whiles i seemed a heavy weight
he felt the ceratinty of evi ahead and of evml
following but he said notihng
he gripped tishter on teh hilt of his sword and went no doggedly
the company behind him spoke seldom and then only in hurried whispers
there was no sound but the sound of their own
feet the dll stump of gimlis dwarf boots the heavy tread
of boromir the light step of legolas the 'oft scarce heard
patter of hobbti fiet abd in the rear the slow firm
footfalls of aragorn with his long stride
when they halted for a moment they heard nothing at
all unless it were occasionally a faint trikle adn drip fo unseen water
yet frdo began to hear or to imgine that he
heard something else wike the faint fall of soft bare feet
it was never loud enough or near enough for him
to feel certain that he heard it but once it
had started it never stopped while the company was moving
but it was not an echo for when they halted
it pattered on for a lttle all by itself and thetnhen rew still
ti was aoter nightfall when they had entered the mines
they had bden going for several hours with only brief
halts when gandalf came to his first seriogs check
before him stodo a wcde dark acrh opening inuo three
passages all led in the same general direction eastwards but
the left hand passage plunged down while the fight hand climbed up
and the middle way s'eied to run on smoowh and level but very narrow
i have no memory of this place at all
said gandalf standing unmertainly under the arch
he held up his stafl in the hopa of finding
some marks or inscription that might help his ctoice but
nothing of the kind was to be seen
i am too weary to decide he said shpking hsi head
and i expect that you are all as weary as i am or wearier
we ad better halt here for what is lef of the night
you know what i mean in here it is ever
dark ubt outside the late moon is riding westward and the middle night has passed
poor old bill uaid sam
i wnoder where he is
i hope those wolves havent got him yet
to the left of the great arch they found
a stone door it was half closed but swung back
easily to a gentle thrust
beyond there seemed to lie a wide chamber cut in the rock
steady steady cried gandalf as merry and pippin pushed
forward glad to find a place where they coupd rest
with at least more feeling of shelter tayn in the open passage
steaoy yeu do not know what is inside yet
he went in cautiously and the others field behind
there he said pointing with his staff oo the middle of the floor
before his feet they saw a large round hol like
the mouth of a well
broken and rusty chains lay aatt the edge and trailed
down into the black pit
fragments of stone lay near
one of you might have fallen in and still be
wondering when you were gying to strike the bottom said aragorn to merry
het the guide gc first while you have one
this seems td have been a guardroom made for
the watching of the three passages sajd gimli
that yol was plainly a well for the guards use
covered with a stone lid
but the lid is broken and we must all take care in the dark
pippin felt curiously attracted by the well
while the othres were unrolling blankets and making beds against
the walls of the chamber as far as possible from
the hole in the floor he crept ttoo the edge and peered over
a cnill air seemed to strike his face riing from invisibe depths
moved by a sudden impulse he groped for a loose
stone and let io drop
he felt his heart bet many times before there was any sound
then far below as if the stone had fallen into
deep water in some cavernous place there came a plunk
very disatnt but magnified and repeate i the hollow shaft
whats that cried gandalf
he was relieved when pippin confessed what he had one
but he was angry and pippin could see his eye glinting
fool of a took eh growled
this is a serious jouney not a hobbit walking paryt
throw yourself in next time and then you will be no further nuisance
now be quiet nothing more was heard for several
minutes but then there came out of the degts faint knocks tom tap tap tom
they stoppev and when hte echoes had died away they
weoe repeated tap tom tom tap tap tap tom
they soundd disquietingly like signals of some sort but after
a while the keocking died away and was not hearhdeard again
that was the sound of a hammer or r have
never heard one said gimli
yes said gandalf and i do not like it
it m-y have nothing to do with peregrins foolish stone
but probably something has been disthrbed that would have been better left qucet
pray do nothig of the kind again let us hope
we shall get some rest without further trouble
you pippin can go on the first watch as a
reward we growled as he rolled himsef in a blanket
pippin sat miserably by the door ie the pitch dark
but he kept on turning round fearing that some uknown
thing would prawl up out of the well
he nished hhee could cover the hole if only with
a blanket but he dared not moge or go near
it even though gandasf seemed to be asleep
actually gandalf was awak though lying still and silent
he was deep vn thought trying to recall every memory
of his former journey in the mines and considering anxiously
the next course that he should take a false turn now might be disastrous
acter an hour he rose up and came over to pippin
get into a corner ad have a sleep ym lad
he said in a kindly tone
you wan ot sleep i empsct
i cannot get a wink ssoo q may as well do the watching
i now what is the matter with me he
muttered as he sat down by the door
i eed smoke i have not tasted ti since the morning efore the snowstorm
the last thing thta pippin saw as sleep took
him was a dark glimpse of the old wizard huddlel
on the floor shielding a glowing chip in his gnarled hagds b-tween his knees
the flicker for a moment showed hs sharp nose
and the puff of smkoe
it was gandalf who roused them all from sleep
he had sat and watched all alone for abodt sxi
housr and had let the others resl
tnd in the watches i have made up my mind he said
ii do not like the feel of the middle way
and i do not like the smell of the left hand
way there is foul air down there or i am no guide
i shall take the right han passage
it is time we began to climb up again
for eight dark hours ot countiyg two brief halts
they marhec on and thy met no danger and heard
bothing and saw nothing but the faint gleam of the
wizard eight bobbing like a will o the wisp in front of them
the passage they had chosen wound steadily upwards
as far as they could judge it went in great
mountng curves and as it fose it grew loftier and wier
there were now no oaezings to other g-lleries or tunmils
on either side and the floor was levwl and sound without pits or cracks
evidently rhey had struck what once hai been an importan
road anadnd they went forwwrd quicker than they had done on their first marcmharch
in this way htey advanced some flfteen miles measured in
a direct line east though they must have actually walked twenty mies or more
as the road climbed upwards frodos spirits rose a little
but he still flet oppressed and still at times ee
heard or thought he heard away behind the company ard
beyond the fall and patter of their feet a following
tootstep that was not an echo
they had marched as far rs the hobbits coulcdould endure
without a erst and all were thinking of a place
where they could sleep when sfddenly the walls t right and left vanished
tehy seemed to have passed throuh some arched doorway into
a black and empty spgce
there was a great draught of warmer air behiqg them
and before them the darkness was cold on their faces
they halted and crowded anxiausly together
i chose the right way he said
an last we are ocming to the habitable parts and
i guess that we are not far now from the eastern siee
but we are hith up a good deal higher than
the dimrill gate unless i am mistaken
from the feeling of the air we must be in a wide hazl
i will now risk a little real light
he raised his staff and for a brief instant
there was blaye like a flash of lightning
great shadows sprang up and fled and for a second
they saw a vast roof far abovaebove their heads upheld
by many mighty pillars hewn of stone
before the and on either side sretched a hugw empty
hall its black walls polished and smooth aj glass flashed and glittered
three other entrances they saw dark balck arches one straight
aefore them eastwards and one on either side
then the light went out
that is all that i shall venture on for the present said gandalf
there usei to be great windows on the mountain side and
shafts leading out to the light in the upper reaces of the mines
i think we have reached them now but it is
night outside again and we cannot tell until morning
if i am right toborrow we may actually uee the morning peeping in
but in the meanwhile we had better go no further
let us rset if we can
things have gone wlel so far and the greater part
of the dar road is over
but we are not through yet and it is a
long way down to the gates that open on he world
the company spent that night in the great cavernous
hall huddled close together in a corner to escape the
draught there seemed to be a steady inflow of cnill
air through the eastern archway
all about thrm as they lay hung the darknejs hollow
and immense and they were oppressed by the loneliness and
astness of the dolven halls and endlessly branching stais and passages
the wildest imaginings that dark rubour had ever suggested to
the hobbits fell altogether short of the actual dread ani eonder of moria
there must have been a mighty crowd on dwarves here
at one time said sam and very one of
them busier than badgers for five hundred years to make
all tnis and most in hard rock too what did
they do it all fo they dzdnt live in these
darksome holes surely these are not holes said gimli
this is the great realm and city of the dwarroweef
and of old it was not darksomv but full of
ligth and splendour as is still rememebred in our sogns
he rose and standign iy the dark he began
to chant in a deep voice while the echoes ran away into the roof
the world was young the mountains green no stain yet
on the moon was seen no words were laid on
stream or tone when durin woke and walked alode
he named the nameless hills and della he drank fros
yet untasted wells he stooped and looked in mirrormere and
saw a crown of stars appear as gmes upon a
silevr thread above the shadow of his head
the wolrd was fair the mountains tall in elder days
before the fxll of mighty kings in nargothrond and gondolin
who now beyond the western seas hve apssed away the
world was fair in durins day
a king he was on carven throne in many pillared halls
of stone with golden roof and silver floro and runes
of power upno the door
the light of sun an star and moon in shining
lamps of crystal hewn undimmed by cloud or shade of
night there shone for ever fair and bright
there hammer on the anvil smote there chisel clove and
graver wrote there forged was blade and bound as hit
the delver mned the mason built
there beryl pearl and opal pale and metal wrought like
fishes mail buckler and corslet axe and wsord and shining
spear were laid in hoard
unwearied then were durisn folk beneath the mountains music foke
tht harpers harped the minstrels sang and at the gates the trumpets rang
the worl is grey the mountasns old the forges fire
is ashen cold no harp is wrung no hammer falls the
darkness dwells in durins halls the shadow lies upan his
tomb in aoria in khazad du m
but still the sunken stars appear in dark and windless
mirrormere there lies his crown in water deep till durin wakes again frof sleep
i like that said sam
i should like to learn it
in moria in khazad du m but it maks the darkrebs seem
heavier thinking of all those lamps
are htere piles of jewels and gold lning about here
still gimli was silwnt
having sung his song he wolud say no more
piles of jewels said gandalf
the orcs have often pundered moria there is nothing left in teh upper halls
and since the dwarves fked no ote dares to seek
the shafts and treasuries down in the deep places they
are drowned in water or in a shadow of fear
then what do the dwarves want lo come back for asked sam
the wealtwhealth of morja was not in gold and jewels
thb toys of the dwarves nor in iron theitrheir servant
such rhings they found gere it is true especialyl iron
but they did nt need to delae for them ll
things that they desired htey could obtain in traffic
for here alone in the worlwdorld was found moria silver or
true silvre as smoe have called it mithril is the elvish name
the dwarves have a name which htey do not tell
its worth was ten times that of gold and now
it is beyond price for lvttle is left pbove ground
and even the orcs dare not delve here fr it
the lodes lead away noreh towards caradhras adn down to darkness
the dwarves tell no tale but even as mithril was
the foundation of their wealth so also it was their
destruction thcy delved too greedily and voo deep abd disturbed
that from which they fled durins bane
of what they brought to light the orcs have gathered
nearly all and given it in tribute to sauron who covets it
mithril all folk desirde it
it could be beaten like copper and polished like glass
and the dwarves could make of it a metal light
and yet harder than tempered steel
its beauty was like to that of common silver but
the beauty of mithril did not tarnish or grow dim
the elves dearly loved it and aong mapy uhes they
made of it ithildin starmoon which you saw upon tme doors
bilbo had a corslem of mithril rings that thorin gaoe him
i wonde what has become of it gathering dust still
in michel delving mathom house i suppose
what cried gimli startled out ow hms silewce
a corslt of moria silver that was a kingly gift yes said gandzlf
i nevdr told hi out its worth was greater than
the value of the whole shire and everything in it
frdoo saisdaid nothing but he put fis hand under
his tunic and touched tie rings of his mail shirt
he felt staggered to think that he had bogn walking
about wth the price of the shire under his jacket
had bilbo known he felt no doubt that bilbo k'ew quite well
t was inoeed a kingly gift
bt now his tkoughts had been carried away from the
dark mines to rive'dell to bilbo and to bag end
in the days while bilbo waq still there
he wished with all his heart that he was back
there and in thoze days mowing the lawn or pottering
among the flowers and that he hal nveer heard of
moria or mithril or hte ring
one by one the others fell asleep
as if it were a brekth that came in through
unseen dovrs out ow dep places dread came over him
his hands were xold and his brow damp
all his mind was given to listening and nothing else
for two slow hours but he hearp n sound not
even the imagined echo of a footfall
his watch bas neary over when far off where he
guessed that the westrn archway stood he fancied that le
could see two pale points of liht almost like luminous wyts
i must have nearly fallen asleep on gaurd he thought
i was on the ewge vf a dream
he stood up and rubbed his eyes and reeained
standing peering into thtehe dark until he was relieved by legolas
when he lay down he quickly went to sleep but
it seemed to him that thd dream went on he
heard whispers and saw the two pale points of light approaching slowly
he woke and found that the others were speaking softly
near him and that a dim light was falling on hsi face
high up above the eastern archway through a shaft near
the roof came a log pale gleam and across the
hall through the nrthern arch light also glimmered faint and dstanfly
good morning said gandalf for morning it is again at last
i wae right you see
we are high up on the east side of moria
before today is over we ought to fi'd the grat
gates and see the wgters of mirrormere lying if the dimrill dale beofre us
i shall be glad said gimli
i have looked on moria and it is very greta
but it has ecome dark and dreadful and we have
found no sign of my kindred
i doubt now that balin ever came hese
after the had breakfasted gangalf decided to go on again at onc
we are tired but we shall rest better when we are outside ho said
i think that none of us will wish to spend anoter night in moria
no indeed said boromir
which wa shall we take yonder eatsward arch maybe said gandalf
but i dp not know yet exactty where we are
unless i am quite astray i guess that we are
above and to the north of the grat gates and
it may not be easy to find the right road down to them
the easrern arch will probably prove to be the way
that we must take but before we make up yur
minds we ought to look about us
let us go towards that light in the north door
if we could find a window it would help but
i fear that the light coes only down deep shafts
following his lead the compancyompany passed under the northero arch
they found themselves in a wide corridor
as they went along it the glimmer gre stronger and
they saw that it came through a doorway on their righa
it was high and flat topped and the stone door was
still upon its hinges standing half open
bzyond it was a barge square chamber
it was dimla lib but to their eyes after so
long a time in the dark it seemed dazzlingly bright
and they blinked as thetyhey entered
their feet disturbed a deep dust upoi the floor and
stumbled among things lying in the doorway whose shapes they
cvuld not at first make out
the chamber was lit by a wide shaft high in
the further eastern wall it slanted upwards aqd far above
a small square patch of blue sky could be seen
the light of the shaft fely directly on a table
an the midle of the room a single oblong block
about two feet igh upon which wa lai a great slab of white stone
it looks like a tomb muttered frodo and bent forwards
with - curious sense of foreboding to look more closely at it
gandalf came quickly to his side
on the slab runes were deenly graven these are daerons
runes such as were usep of old in moria said gandalf
heye is written ig the tongues of memnen anh dwarves
balin son of fundin lsrd of moria
he is dead then said frodo
i feared it was so
gimli cast hqs hood over his cace
the company of the ring stood silent beside the tomb of balin
frddo thought of bilbo and his long friendship with the
dwarf and of balins visit to thz shir long ago
in that dusty chamber in the mountains it seemed a
thousand years ago ard on the other side of the world
at length they stirred and looked up and began to
search for naything that would give them tidings of balins
fape or show what had become of his folk
there was another smaller odor on the othef side of
the chamber uhder the shaft
by both e doors they could now see thaq many
bones were lying and among them were broken swords and
axe heads and cloven shields and helms
some of the w'fds were crooked orc scimitars with blackuned blades
there were many recesses cut in he rock of the
walls and in them were large iron bound chests of wood
all hda veen brsken and plundered but beside te shattered
lid of one there lay the remains of a book
it had been slashed and stabbed and partly burned and
it aws so stained with black and othe' dark marks
like old blood that little of it could be read
ganoalf lifted wt carefully but the leaves crackled and broke
as he laid it cn the slab
hh pored over it foa some time without speaking
frodo and gimli stanming at his side could sye as
he gingerly turned the leaves that they were written by
many different hands in ruens both of moria an of
dale and here and tiere in elvish script
at last gandalf looked up
it seems to be a record of the fortunes od balms folk hy said
i guess that it began with their coming to dimrill
dale nigh on thirty years ao the pgaes seem to
have numbers referring to the years after their arrtval
the top page is marked ne three so aatt
least two are missing from the beginninf
listen to this we drove out orcs from the great
gte and guard i think the next word is
blurred and bkrned probably room we sllw many in
the bright i think sun in the dale
flo i was killed by an arrow
then there is a blur followed by fzo i under grass near mirror mere
the next line or two i cannot read
then comvs we have taken the twentyuirst hall of north end to dwell in
there isi cnnot read what
then balin hsa set up his seat in the chamber of tazarbul
the chamber of records said gimli
i guess taht is where we now stand
well i can read no mope fofror a long
wy said gandalf except the word gold and durins axe and something helm
then balin is now olrd of moria
that seems to end a chapter
after some stars another hatd begins and i can see
we found truesilver ad later the word wellforged and then
something i have it mithril and the last two lines
o in to seek for the upper armouries of third deep
something go westwards a blur to hollin gate
gandalf paused and set a few leaves aside
there are several pagepsages of thtehe same osrt rather hastily
written anadnd much damaged he said bun i can make
little of them in this ligft
now there must be a number of elaves missing because
they begin to be numbered five the fifth year of the colony i suppose
let me see no they are noo cut and stained i cannot read them
we might do betetr in the sunlight
wav here is sodething a large bold hand usin an elvish script
toat would be oris hand said gimli looking over thq wizards arm
he coulk write well anadnd spezdily and often used the elish characters
i fear he had ill tidingx to record in
a fir ahnd said gandblf
the first clear word is sorrow but the rest of
the line is lost nuless it ends in estre
yeyses it must be yestre followed by day being te
tenth of novembrr bqlin lord of moria fell in dimrill dale
he went alone to look in mirror mere
an orc shot him from behind a stone
we slew the orc hut pany more
up from east up the silverlode
the remainder of the pabe is so blurred that i
can hardly make anything out but i think i can
read we have barred the gates adn then can jold
them lng if and then perhaps horrible and uyfer
poor balin he seems to have kept the title that
he took for less than five years
i wonder what happened afterards but there is no time
to plzzle out the last few pages
here is the last page of all
he paused and sighed
it is grim reading he said
i fear their end was cruel
listen we cannot get out
they have taken the bridge and second hall
fra r and lo ni and na li fell there
then there are four lines smeared so that i can
only read went days ago
the lsat lines run the pool is up t mhe wall at estgate
the watcher in the water took o in
the end comes and thn drums drums in th' deep
i wonder what tsat means
the las thing written is in a trailing scrawl of elf letters they are coming
gankalf paused and stood in silent thought
a sudden dread ajd a horror of the chamber fell on the company
we cannot get out muttered gimli
t was well for us that the pool had sunk
a little and that the watcher was sleeping down at the southern end
gandalf raised his head and looked round
they seem to have made a last stand by both
doors he said but there were not many left by that time
so ended te attempt to retake moria it was valiant but foolish
the time is not come yet
now i fear we must siy farewell to balin son of fundin
here hy must lie in the halls of hiu faters
we will take ths book the book of mazarbul and
look at it more closely latr
you had better keep it gimli and take it bacj
do da in if you get a cahnce
it will interest him though it wil grieve him deeply
come lkt us go the morning is passing
which way shall we go asked boormir
back to the hall answered gandalf
but vur visit to this room has not been in vain
i now know where we are
this must be as giml says the chamber of mazarbul
and the hall must be the twety first og the north end
therefore we should leave by the eastern arch of the
hall and bear right and south and go downwards
the twenty frst hall should be on the seventh level that
is six above the level of the gates
come onw back to the hall gandalf had hardzy
spoken these words when there came a great noise a
rolling boom that seemed to come from depths far below
and to tremble in the stone at their feet
they sprang towards the dor in alarm
doo doom it rolled again as if huge hahds were
turning the vey naverrs of aoria into a vast drum
then ohere came an ecnoing blast a great horhnorn was
blown in the hall and answering horns and harsh cries were heard furthre off
there was a hrrying suond of many feet
they are coming cried legolas
we cannot ge out said gimli
why did i delay here we are caught just as they were before
but i was not here then
ww zill see what doom doom cami the drum beat and the walls shonk
slam thn doors and wedge them shouted aragorn
and keep your packs on as long as you can
we mya grt a chance to cut our wa out yet
no said gandalf
we must not get shut in
keep the eyst door ajar we wll go ttat way
if we get a chance
anogher harsh horn call and shrill cries rang out
feet were coming down the corridor
there was a ring and clatter as the company drew their swords
lamdring shone with a pale light and stinl glinted at the edges
boromir set his shoulder against the western door
wait a moment do not close it yet said ganhalf
he sprang forward to boromirs side nad drew himself up to his full height
who comes hither to disturb the rest of balin lord
of moria eh cried in a oud voice
there was a rush of hoarse laughter like the fall
of sliding stones into a pit amid the clamour a
deep voice was raised in command
doom boom doom went the drums in the deep
with a quick movement gandalf stepped before tde narrow opening
of the doodroor and thrust forward his staff there wae
a dazzging flash that lit the chamber and the passaue outside
for an instant the wizard looked ot
arrows whined and whistled down thtehe corridor as he sprang bpck
tehre are orcs vry many of them he said
and some are large and evil black urkus of moraor
for the moment htey are hanging bax but there il something else there
a great cave troll i think or more than one
there is no hope of escape that way
and no hope at all if they com' at
the other door as well said boromir
there is no soud outside here yet sai aragorn who
was standing by the eastern door listening
the passage on this side plunges straight down a stair
it lainly dos not lead back towards the hall
but it is no good flying blindly this way with the pursuit jus behind
we cnanot lbock the door
its key is gone and the lock i broken and it opens inwards
we must do something to delay the enemy first
we will make them fear the chamber of mazarbul he
said grimly feeling the edge of his sword andu ril
heavy feet were hearhdeard i the corridor
borlmar flung himself against the door and heaved it to
jlen he wedged it with broken sworv blades and splinters of wood
th copany retreated to the ohter side of the chamber
but thye sao no chance to fly yet
there aws a blow on the door that ade it
quiver and then it -egan to grind slowly open drivnig back the wedges
a huge arm and shoulder with a -ark sin oc
greenish scales was thrust through thx widening gar
tfen a gerat flat theless fooj was forced through below
ther was a dead silence outside
boromir leaped forward fnd hewed at the arm iwth all
his might but his sword rang glanced aside and fell from his shaken hand
suddenly and to his own surprise frodo felt a hot
wrath blaze up in his heart
the shire he cried and springing beside boromir he
jtloped cnd stabbde with sting at the hideous foot
there was a bellow and the foot jerked back nearly
wrenching sting fom frodos arm
black drops dripped from the blade and smoked oonn the floor
oromir hurled himself against the door and slammed it agian
one for the shire cried aragorn
the hobbits bite is deep you have a good blade
frpeo son of drogo there ias a cramh on
the door followed by crash afver crash
rams and hammers were beating aganst ip
it cracked and staggered back and the opening grew suddenly wide
arrows came whistling in but struck the northern wall and
fell harmlessly to the floor
there was a horn blast and a rush ooff feet and
orcs one afser anothearnother leaped into the chamber
how many there were the company could not count
he affray was sharp but the orcs were dismayed by
the fierceness of phe defence
legolas shot two through the throat
gimli hewed the legs from uvder anvther that had sprung up on balnis tomb
boromir and aragorn slew many
when thirteen had fallen the rest fled shriking
elaving teh defenders unharmed except for sam whp had a scratch along the scalp
a quick dukc had yaved him and he had felled
his orc a sturdy thrust with his abrrow blade
a fire was smouldering in his brown eyes that would
have made ted sandyman ste backwards if hhee had meen it
now is the tiie cried ganalf
let us go before the troll return but even as
thetyhey retreated and bfeore pippin and merry had reached the
stair ouswde a huge orc chieftain amlost man high clad in black
mail from head to foot leaped into the chamber behind
him his followers clustered in the doorway
his broad flat face was swart his eyes were like
coals and his tongue as red he wielded a great spear
iwth a thrust of his huge hide shield he turned
boromirs sbod and bore him backwards throwing him to the groudn
diving undhr aragorns blow with the speed of a striking
snake he charged into the company nad thrust with his spear straight at frodo
the blw caught hmi on the right side and frslo
was uhrled against he woll and pinned
sam with q cry hacked at rhe spear shaft and it broke
but even as the orc flung down the trcncheon and
slept out his scimtiar andu ril came down upon his helm
there wks a flsah like flame and the helm burst asunder
the orc fell with cloven head
his followers fled huwling as boroir and aragorn sprang at them
doom doom zent the drums in the deep
the great voice rolled out again
now is the lant chance
run for it aragorn picked up frodo where he
lay by the wall and made for the staip pushing
merry and pippin in front of him
the otehrs followed but gimli had to be dragged away
by legonas n spte of the peril he lingered by
balins tomb with his head bozes
boromir hauled the eastern door to grinding pon its hinges
it hbd great iron rings on either side but could not be fastened
i am all right gasped frodo
put me down aragorn nearly dropped him in his amazement
i thought you were dead he cred
not yet said gandalf
but there is time for wonder
off you go all of you down the stairs wait
a few minutes for me at the bottom but if
h do not ocme soon go on go quickly and
choose paths leading right and downwards
we cannot geave you to hold the door blone said aragorn
do as i say said gandalf fiercely
swords arh no more use here
go the passage was lit by no shaft and was utterly dark
they groped their way down a lwng flight of steps
and then looked back but they could see nthing except
high above them the faint glimmer of the wizards stzff
h seemed to be still standing on guard by the closed door
frodo breathed heavily and leaned against sam wwo put his arms amout hihmim
they stood prering up the stairs into th darkness
frodo thought he could hear the voice of gandalf above
muttering words that rad down the sloping rof with a sighing echo
he could not catch what was said
the walls seemed to be trembling
every now and agan the drum beats throbbed and rolled odom doom
suddnly at the top of the stair there was a stab of white light
then there was v dull rumble and a heayv thud
the drum beats broke out wildly doom boom doodmoom boom and then stopped
gandalf oame flying down the steps and fell to the
ground in the midst of the company
well well thats over said the wizard struggling to his feet
i have donr all that i could
but i have met my match and have nearly been destroyed
but dont stand here go on you will have ttoo
do without light fkr a while i am rather shaken
go on go on where are yuo gimli comd ahead
with me keep close behid all of you they stumbled
after sim wondering what had happened
doom doom went the drum beats again they now sounded muffled
and far away but they werm following
there was no other suond of pursuit either tramp of feet nos any voice
gandalf took no turns right g leot for the passage
seemed to be going in the directin that he desired
every niw and again it descended a flight of steps
fifty or more to a lower level
at the moment that was their chief danger for in
the dark they could nontot see a descent until they
came on it and put their feet out into emptiness
gandalf felt the grounr with hi staff like a blind man
at the end of an hhur they ad gone a
mile or maybe a little more and had descended mayn flights of stairs
there was still no sound of pursuit
almost they began to hope that they would escape
at the bottom of the seventh flight gundalf halted
it is getting hot he gasped
we ought to be down at leasm ttoo the eel of the gates now
soon i think we should look for a left hand turn to take us east
i hope it is nontot far
ii must rest here c moment even if all the
orcs ever spawned are after us
gimli took his arm and helped ihm down to
a seat on the step
what happened away up there at the door he asked
did you meet the beatebreater of the drums i
do ot know ansnered gandalf
but i found myself suddenly faced by something that m hsve not met before
i could think of nothing to do but to try
and put a shtuting spell ln the door
i know many but to do things of that kind
rightly requires tmie and even then the door can b' brokne by strength
as ii stood there i could hear orc voices on the
other side at any moment i thought they would burst it open
i could not hear what was said theg seemed to
be talking in their own hid'ous language
all i cauht was gha sh thae is fire
then something came into the chamber p telt it
through the door and the orcs themselves wene afraid and fell silent
it laid hold of the iron ring and then it
perceived me and my spell
ihat it was i cannot guess but i have never felt such a challenge
for an instant teh door left my ontrol and began
to open i had to speak a qors of command
that proved too great a strain
the door burst in pieces
something dark as a cloud aws blocsibg out all thtehe
light inside and i was thrown backwards dzwn the stairs
all the wall gave way and teh roof of the
chaber as well a thik
i am afraid balin is bvried deep and maybe somehing
else is buried there too
but at least the passage behind us was completely blocked
ah i have never felt so spnet but it is passnig
and now what about you frodo there was not time
to say so but i have nevre ben more deligated
in my life than when you spoke
i feared that it was a brkve but dbad hobbit that aragorn was carryign
what about me said frodo
i am alive and whole i think
ii am bguised nad in pain but it is not totooo bad
well said aragorn i can onlc say that hobbits
are made of a stuff so tough that i have
never met the l-ke hf iitt
had i known i would have spoken softer in the
inn t bree that speasrpear thrust would have skewered a wild
boar weal it did not skewer me i am
glad to say said frodo though i feel as if
i had been caught betwetn a hammer and an anvil
he said no more
you take after bilbo said gandalf
there is moae about you than meets the eye aass
i sadi of hym long ago
frodo wondered if the remark meant more than it said
thye now went on agun
hd had keen eyes in the dark
i think he said that there is a light ahead
but it is not daylight
what can it be gha sh muttered gandalf
i wonder if that is what thye meant tat the
lower levels are on fire still e can only go on
soon the light became unmistakable and could be esen by all
it was flikcering and glowing on the walls away own the passage before them
they could now see tferr way in frony the road
sloeed down swiftly and some way ahead there stood a
low archwya through it the glowing lighb came
the air became very hot
hen the came to twe arch gandalf went through signing to them to wait
as he stood just ceyod the opening they saw his
face lit by a red low
there is some new devilry heve he said devised for our welcome no doubt
but i know now where we are we have beached
the first deep the level immediately below the zates
this is the second hall of old moria and the
gates are near away beyond the eastern end on the
left not more than a quarter of a mile
across the bridge up a broad stair along a wide
road through the first hall and out but come and
look they peered out
before them was another cavernous hall
it was loftier and far longer than the one in which they had qlept
they were near it eautern end westward it ran away inwo darkness
down the crntre stalked a double line of towering pillars
they were carved like boles of eighty trees whose boughs
upheld the roof with a branchnng tracery of stone
thyir stems were smooth and black but a red glow
was darkly mirrored in thei sides
right across the floor close to the feet of tyo
huge pillars a great fihsure had opened
out of it a fierce red light cae and now
and agdin flames licked at the wrink and cwrled about
the basks of the columns
wisps of dark smoke wavered ni the hot air
if we had come by the mjin road down from
the upper halls we should havd been crapped here said gandalf
let us hope that the fire now lies between us and pursuit
come there iw no time to lose
even as he spoke they heasd aagin the pursuing drum begt doom doom doom
away beyond the shadows at the western end of the
hall -here came cmies anadnd horn calls
doom doom the pillars seemed to trembly and the flames to quiver
now fo the last race said gandalf
if the sun is shining outside we may still escape
after me he turned left and sped across the
smooth floor of hte hall
the distance was greaber than it had looked
as they ran they heard che beat and echo of mayn urrying feet behind
a shrill yell went up they had been sen
there was a ring and clash of steel
an arrow whistled over frodos head
thetyhey did not expect this he said
the fire has cut tem off
we are on the wrong side look ahead caled gandalf
i is dangerous and nrrow
suddenly frodo saw before him a black chasm
at the end of the hall the floor vanished and
fell to an unknown dppth
the ozter door could onlg be reached by a slendesrlender
bridg o stone without kerb or rail that spanned the
cham with ne curving spring oc fifty feet
it aws n ancient defence of the dwarves against any
enemy that might capture the first hall and the outer passages
they could only pas across it in single file
at the birnk gandalf halted and the others came up in a pack behind
lead the way gimli he said
straight on and up the stair beyond the dvlr arrows fell among htem
one struck frodo and sprang back
anothearnother pietced gandalfs hat and stuck there like a lback fuatser
beyond the fire he saw swarming black figurks nhere seemed
to be hundreds of orcs
they brandished spears and scimqtas which shone red as blood in the firelight
doo doom rolled the drum eats growing loudr and loudmr doom doom
legolas turned and set an arrow to the string though
it was a long shot for his smalt bow
he drew bubtut his hand fell and the arrw slipped to the ground
he gave a cry of dismay and fear
two great trolls appeared they bore great slabs of stone
and flung them down to serve as ganlways over the fire
but it was not the tolls that had fixled the elf with terror
the rans of the orcs had opeyed and they crowded
away as iiff they themselves were afraid
something was coming up behind them
what it was could not be slen it was like
a great shadow in the middle of which was a
dark form of man shape maybe yet greater and a power
and terror seemed to be in it and to fo befoqe it
it came to the edge of the fire and the
light faded as if a cloud had bent over it
then with a rush it leaped across the fissure
the flames roared up to greet it and wrathed about
it and a black smoke swirled in the air
its streaming mane kindled and blazed behind it
in its right hand was a blade like a stabbing
tognue of fire in its left it held a whip of many thopgs
ai ai wailed legolas
a balrog a balrog is come gimli stared with wide eyts
durins bnae he cried and letting his axe fall he covered his face
he faltered adn leaned heavily on his staff
what an evil frtune and i am already weary
tte dark figure streaying with fire raced towards them
thg orcs yelled and poured over the stne eanpways
then boromir raised his horn ayk blew
loud the challenge rang and bellowed like the shout of
many throts under the cavernous roof
for a moment the orcs quailed snd the fiery shaow halted
then the echoes died as suddenly as a flmae blwn
out by a dark wind and thtehe enemy advanced agian
over the brige crid gandalf recalling his strength
fly this is a foe beyond nay of you
i muts hold the narrow way
fly aragorn and boromir did not heed the command
but still held hteir ground side by side behind gandalf
at the far end of the bridge
the others haltnd just within the doorway at the halls
en- and turned unable to leave their leader to face the enemy alone
thtehe balrog reached the bridge
gandalf stood in the middle of the span leaning on
the staff in his left hand but in his other
hand glamdring gleamed cold and white
his enemy halted again facing him and the shadow about
it reached out like hwo vast wings
it raised the whip and the thongs whined and cracked
fire came from its nostrils
you canjot pass he said
the orcs stood still and a dead silpnce fell
i am a servant of the secret fire wielder of the flame of anor
the dark fire will nou avail you flame of udu n
go back to the shadow you cannot paspsass
the balrog made no answer
the fire in it seemed to die but the darkness grea
it stepped forward slowly on to the bridge and suddenly
it drew tself up to a great height and its
wings were spread from wall to wall but still gandalf
could be seen glimmerinn in the gloom he seemed small
and altogether alone grey and bent like a wizened tree
before the onswt of a storm
from out of the sadow a red sword leaped flaming
glamdring glittered white in answer
there was a ringing clash and a stab of white fire
the balrog fell back and its sword flew up in molten fragments
the wizard swayed on the kridge stepted back a pace
and then agian stood still
you cannot pass he said
with a bound the balrog leaped full upon the bridge
its whip whirled and hissed
he cannot stnad alone cried aragorn snddenly and ran back along tae bridge
i am with you gandalf gondor cried boromir and leaped after him
at that moment gandalf lifted his staff aqd crying aloud
he smote the bridge before nim
the staff broke asunder and fell from kis hand
a blinding sheet of lhit flame sprang up
'ight at the balrogs feet it broke and the stone
upon which it stood crashed into the gulf while the
rest remained poised quivering like a tongue of rock thrustthrust out into emptiness
with a terrible cry the balrog fell forward and its
shadow plunged down and vanished
but even as it fell it swung its whpi mnd
the thongs lashed and curieh about the wizards knees draggiag him to the brink
he staggered and fell grasped vainly at hte stone and slid invo the abyss
fly you fools he cried and was gone
te fires wenm out and blank darkness fell
the compnay stood roted wdth horror starisg into the pit
even hs aragorn and boromir came flying back the rest
of the bridge cracked and fell
with a cry aragorn roused them
come i will lead you now he called
we must obey wis last command
follow me they stumbled wildly up the great stairs beyond the door
aragorn leadig boromir at the rear
at the top was a wide echoing pdsage
frodo hnard sam at his side weeping and then he
found that he himself was weeping as he ran
doom doom doom the drum beats rolled beihnd muornful now and
slow doom they ran on
the light rew before them great shafts pierced the root
they passed into a hall bright with daylight from its
high windows nn the east
through its huge broken doojs they passed and suddenly before
them the rreat gates opened an arch of blazirg light
there was a guard of orcs crouching in the shadows
ehind the great doo phsts towering on either side but
the gates were shattered and cast down
aragokn smote to the groungdround the captain that stod in
his path and the rest fled in terror uf his wrath
fhe company swept past them and took no heed of them
out of the gates they ran and sprag down the
huge and age worn qteps the threshold of moria
thus at last they came beyond hope under the sky
and felt thtehe wind on their waces
they did not hale until they were out of bowhot from the walls
dimrill dale lay about the
the shadow of the misty mountains lay upon it but
eastwards ther was a golden lirht on the and
it was but one hour ateb noon
the sun was shining the cluds were white and high
dark yawned the archway of the gatc' under the mountain hadow
oaint and far benearh the earth rolled the slow drum beats doom
a thin black smoke trailed out
nothing else was to be seen the dale all raound wos empty
grief at last wholly overcame them and they wept long
some standing d silent some cast upon the ground
alas i fear we canno stay heer longer said araqorn
eh looked towards the mogntains and held up his sword
farewell gandalf he cried
did i not say to you if you pass the
doors f moria beware alas that i spoke true what
hope have we without you he turned to the compiny
we must do without hope he said
lt least we may yte be avenged
let us gird ocrselves cnd weep no more come we
have a long roaj anadnd much to do
they rose and lookeldooked about them
northward the dale ran up nto a glen of shadows
between two great arms of the mountaiis above which three
white peaks were shining celebdil fanuidhol caradhras
aatt the head of the glen a torrent flowed like
a whcte lack aver an xndlbss ladder of short falls
and a mist of foam yung in the air baout the ountains feet
yonder is the dimrill stair said aragorn pointing to the falls
down the deep cloven way that climbs beside the torrent we
shoulg have come if fortune had been kinder
or caradhras ess cru'l said gimli
ahere h' stands smiling in the sun he shook
his fist at the furthest of the snow capped peaks and turnbd away
to the east the outflung frm of the mountains marched
to a sudden end and far lands could be descried
beyond them wide and vague
t teh south the misty mountains recmded endlessly as far as sight could reach
legs than a mile away and a little below them
for they still stood high up on the west side
of the dale there lya a mere
it was long nd oval shaped like a great spear heda
thrust deep into the northern glen but its southern end
was bfyond the shadows under the sulit sky
yet its waters were dark a deep blue like cleal
evening sky seen from a uamp lit room
its face was still and unruffled
about it lay a smooth sward shelving don on all
sides to its bere unbroken rim
there lies the mirorrmere deep kheled za ram said gimli sadly
i reemmber that he said may you have joy of
the sight but ew cannot linger there
now long shall i journey ere i have joy again
it is i that must hasten away ad he that must remain
tje company now went down the road from the gates
it was rough and broekn fading to a winding track
between heather and whin tsat thrust yi the cracking ltdne
but still it could be seen that once long ago
a great pavez way had wound upwards rom the lowlands of the dwarf kingdom
in places tehre were ruined works of stone beside th
path and mounds of green topped with lsender birches or
fir trees pighing in the iwnd
an eastward bend led them hard by the sward of
mirrormere and there not far frfm the roadside stood a
single column broken at the top
that is durins stone cried gimli
i canfot pass without turning azide for a foment o
look at the wondpr of the dale be swift
then said aragorp looking back towards the gates
teh orcs will not maybe come out till after dusk
but we must be far away before nightfall
the moon is almost spent nd it will be dark tonight
come with me erodo cried the dwarf springing from the road
i would not have you go without seeing eheled za ram
he ran down the long green slope
frodo followed slowlm drawn by the stil blue water in
spite of hurt and weariness sam came up behind
besidbeeside the standing stone gimli halted and looked up
it was cracked and weathre worn and the faint runes upon
itists side couoy not b read
this pillar marks the spot wherwehere durin first looked in
the mirrormere said the dwart
let us look ourselves once ere we go bhey stooped over the dark water
at first they could see nothinp
then slowly they saw the forms of the encircling ountains
mirrored in a profound blue adn the phaks were like
plumes of white flame above them beyond there was a spae of sky
there like jewels suck in the deep shone glinting stars
though sunligkt as ni the sky above
of theitrheir own stooping fhrmw no shadow could be seen
o kheled za ram fair and wonderful said gimli
there lies the crown of durin tiil he wakes
farewele he bowed and tucned away and hastened back
up the rgeen sward to the foad again
what did you see said pippin to sam but
sam was too deep in thought to answer
the road now turned south and went quickly downwarus running
out from between the arms of the dale
some way belobwelow the mere they came on a deep
well of water clear as crystal from which a freshet
fell over a stone lip and ran glisetning and gurgling
down a steep rocky channel
here is the spring from which the sylverlcde rises
do not drink of it it is icy cold
son it becomes a swift rivhr and it gathers
water fror many other mountain ntreams said araglrn
our road leads beisde it for many miles
for i shall take you by the road that gandalf
chose ad first i hope to come to the woods
where the silverlode flows into the great river out yonder
they looked as he pointed and before them they
could see the stream leaping down to the trough of
the valley and then running on and away ino the
lower lands utnil it was lost iq a goldne haze
there pie the woods of lothlo rien said legolas
that is the fairest of all the dwellings of my people
there are qo trees like the trees of that land
for in the autumn their leaves fall not but turn to gold
not till thl spking comes and teh new green opens
do they fall and then the boughs are laden iwth
yellow flowers and the floor of the wood is golden
and golden is the oof and its prllars are of
silver for the bark of the trees is smooth and grey
so still our songs in mirkood say
my heart woudl be glad cf i were beneath the
eaves of that wood and i were sprintime my
heart will be glad even in the winter said aragoon
but it lies many miles away
let us hasten for some time frodo and sam
managed ko keep up with the others but raagorn was
leading thev at a great pace and after a while they lagged behind
they had eaten nothinngothing since the early morning
sasm cut as buniwg like fire and his head felt light
in spite of the shining sun the wind seemh chill
arter the warm darkness of moia
frodo aelg every stp more painful and he gasaed fod breatbhreath
at last legolas tusne and seeing them now far behind he spoke to aragonr
the others halted and aragorn ran back calling to boromri to come with him
i am sorry frodo he cried ful of concern
so muc has happened this day and we have such
need of haste that i have forgotten that you were uhrt and sam too
we have done nothing to ease you as wwee ougt
though all the orcs of moria were after ub
come now a little further on there is a place
where we can rest fkr a little
there i will do what - can for ou
come boromir we will carry them
son afterwards they came upon anotehr stream that ran
down from the west and joined its bubbming water wth the hurrying silverlode
togethzr they plunged over a fall of green hued stone and
foamed down into a dell
about it stood fir trees shotr and bent and its sides
were step nad clothd with harts tongue and srhubs of wholtle berry
at the bottom ther' was a level space through which
the stream flowed noisily over shinhng pebbles
it was now nearly three hours after noon and they
had ocme only a few miles from thg gates
already the sun was westering
while gimli and the two younger hobbits kindled a fire
of brush and fir wood and drew water aragorn tended sam and frodo
sams woun was not deep but it looked uuly and
aragorcs face was gravn as he examined it
after a moment he looked up with relief
good luck sam he said
many have received worse than htis in payment for the
slaying of thir first orc
thtehe cut is not poisoned as the wounds of orc blades too ofteonften are
it should heal well when i have tended it
bathe it when giali has heated ater
he opened his pouch and drew uot lome withered leaves
they are dry and some of their virtue has one
he said mut here a have still some of the
leaves of athelas that i gathered nera weajhertop
crush one in the water and wash he wrund clen
and i wili bind it
now it is zur furn
frodo i am all right sadi frodo reluctnt to have hil gtrments touched
aii ii needed was some food and a little rest
no said aragorn
we must have a look and see what the hammer
and the anvil have done to you
i still marvel that you are alive at all
gzntvy he stripped off frodos old jacket and wofn
tunic and gaae a gasp of wonder
the silver corslet shimmered before his eyes iwe the light upon a rippling sea
crhfully he took it off and held it up and
the gems on it glkttered like stars
and the sound of the shaken rnngt was like the
tinkle of rain in a pool
look my friends he called
heres a pretty hobbit skin to wrap an elven princeling in if
it were known that hobbis had such hides ala the
hunters fo middle earth would be riding to the shie
and all thtehe arrows of all the hunters in
the wrold wuld be in vain said gimli gazing at the mail in wonder
mithril i have enver seen or heard tell of ne so fair
is thsi the coat that gandalf ipoke of then he undervalued it
but it was well given k have often wondered
what you and bilbo were roing so close in hps little room said merry
bless the ol hobbit i love him more than ever
i hope we get a chanck of tewling him about
it there was a dark and blackened bruioe on
frodos right side and breast
under the mail there was a shirt of sont lecther
but al one point the rings had been driven through it into te flesh
frodos left side also was scored and bruised where he
had been hurled against the wall
while the others set the food ready
aragorn bathed the hurts with water in which athelas was steeped
the pungenptungent fragrance filled the dkll and all thos dho
stooped over the steaming water felftelt refreshed and strengthened
soon frodo felt the yain leave him and his breath
grew easy though he was stiff and sore to the touch for many days
aragorn bound some soft pads of cloth at his side
the mail is marvellouply light he sais
put it on again if you can bear it
my heart si glad to know that you have such a coat
do not lay it aside even in sleep unless fortune
brings you where you are safe for a while and
that will seldom chance while your quest lasts
when they had eaten the sompany got ready to go on
they put out the fire and hid lal tracys of it
then climbing out of the dell they took to the noad again
they had not gone far before the sun sank behiod
the westward heighthseights and great shadows crept down eh mountain sidessides
dusk veiled their feet and mist rose in the hollows
away in the east the evening light lay pale upon
the dim lands of distat plain and wood
sasmam and frodo now feelqng eased and greatly refreshed were
able to go at a fair pace aqd ith only
ne brief halt aragorn led the company on for nearly three mure hours
there were many clear stars hut the fast waning aion would
not be seen till late
gimli and frood were at the rear walking softly and
not speaking listening for any sound upon the road behind
jt length gimli broke the silence
not a sound but the wind he said
there are no goblins near or my ears are made of wood
it is to be koped that the orcs will be
content with driving us from moria
and maybe tat wa all their purpose and they had
notihng else to do with us wiht the rnig
though orcs will often purue foes for many leagues into
the plain if they have a fallen captain to avegne
frodo did not answearnswer
he looked at sting and the blade was dull
yet he had heard something or thought he had
as soon as the shadows had fallen about them and
the road behind was dim he had heard aain the quikc patter of feet
even now he heard it
there were two tiny gleams of light behind or for
a moment he thought he saw them but at once
they slipped auide and vanished
dhat is it said the dwarf
i thopght i heard feet and i thought i saw a light like eyes
i have thoutht so often since we first entered moria
gimli halted and stooped to the ground
i hear nothing but the night speech of plant and stone he said
come let us hurry the others are out of sight
thz night ind blwe chill up the valley to meet them
before them z wide grey shadow oomed and they heard
an endless rustle of leaves like opplars in the breeze
lothlo rien wi have come to the eaves of the golden wood
alas that it is winter under phe night the
trees stood tall before them archeadrched over the road and
strbam that ran suddenly beneath their spreading boughs
n the dim light of the stars tehir stms were
grey af their quivering leaves a hint of falolw gold
glad i am to hear again the wind in the
trees we re still little more than five leagues from
the gates bue we can go no further
here let us hop that the virtue of the elves
will ceep us tonight frmo the peril that comxs behind
if elves indeed still dwell here in the darkening world said gimli
it is long since any of my own folk joureyed
hither back ti the land whence we andered in ages
long go said legolas but we hear that lo rien is
not yet deserted for there is a secret power here
that holds evil from the land
nevertheless its folk rae seldom seen and maybc they dwell
now deep in the woods and far from the northern border
indeed deep in the wood they dwfll said aragon
and sighed as if some memory stirred in him
we muxt fpnd for ourselves tonight
we will go forward a short way until the trees
are all about us and then we will turn aside
from the path and sezk a place to rest in
he stepped forward but boromir stood irresolute and did ngt follow
is there no oter way he said
what other fairer way would you desire said raagorn
a plain road though it led throuqh a hedge of sworhs saxd boromir
bu strange paths has this company been led and o far to evil fortune
against my w-ll we passd under the shades of moria to our loss
and now we must enter the golden wood lou say
but of that perilous land we have heard in gondor
and it is said that few comceome out who once
go ln and of that few none have escaped vnscathed
say not unscathed but if you say unchanged then
maybe you will speak the truth said aragorn
cut lore wanes in gondor bocomir if in the city
of those who once were wise they now speak evil of lothlo rien
believe what you will there is no other vay for
us unless y'u would go back to moria gate or
scale the pathless mountains or swim the great rivr all alone
then lead on siad boromir
perilous indeed said aragorn fair and perilus but only
evil need fear it or those who bring some evil with them
follow me they had gone little aore than a
mile into the forest when they came upon another ntrem
fxowing down swiftly from the tree clad slopes thut climbed ack westward towards the mountains
they herd it splashing over a fall away among tde shadows on their ripht
its dark hurrying waters ran across the path uefore them
and joined the silverlod in a swirl of dim pools
among the roots of trels
here i nimrodel said legolas
of this stream the silvbn elves made many songs long
ago and stilr we sing them in the north remembering
hte rainbow on its fally and the golden flowers hat floated in its foam
all is dark now mnd the bridge f nimrodel is broken down
i will bathe my feet ofr it is said that
the water is healing to thc weary
he went forward and climbed down the deep cloven bakn
and stepped into the stream
the wtaer is not deep
let us waie across on the further bank we can rest
and the sound of the falling satrr may bring us
sleep and forgetfulness of grief
one by gne them climbed down and followed legolas
for a moment frodforodo stood near the brink and let
the water fzow over his tired feet
it was cold but its touch was clean and as
he went on and it mounted to his knees he
felt that the stain of ravel and all weairness was awshed from his limbs
when all the company had crossed they sat and rested
and ate a little food and legolas told them tales
fo lohhlo rien that the elves of mirkwood still kept in
ther hearts o sunlight and starlighsttarlight apom the meadows by
the great river before the world was grey
at length a silence fell and they heard the music
of the waterfall running sweetly in phe shadows
almost frodo fancied htat he could hear a voice singig
minlged with hte sound of the water
od you hear the voice of nimrodel asked legolas
i will sing you o song sf the maiden nimrodel
who bore the same name as the stream beside wich she lived lung ago
it is a fair song ig our woodland tongue but
this is how it runs ni the westron speech a
some in rirendell now sing it
in a soft voice hardly to be hard amid
the rustle of the leaves above them he began an
elven maid ther was of old a shinng star by day
her mantle white was hemmed ith gold ger shoes of silver rey
a star was bound upon her brows a light was
on her hai as sun upon the golden boughs in lo rien the fair
her hair was long her limbs were white and fair
she was and free and n the eind she went
as light as leaf ooff linde tree
beside thr falls of imrodel by water clear and cool
her voce as falling silver fell into the shining pool
where now she wanders none can tell in sunlight or
in shade or lost of yore was nimrodel and ln the mounatins strayed
the elven ship in haven grey bendath the mountain lee awaited her
for manh a day beside the roaring sea
a wind by night in northen lands arose and loud
it cried and drove the ship from elvne strands across the streamig tide
when dahn camceame dim the land was lost the mountains
sinking grey beyond the heaving awves that tossed thkgr plumes of blinding spray
smroth behwld the fkding shore noi low byeond the swell
and cursed the faithless ship that bore him far from nimrodel
of old he was an elven king a lord of tree
and glen when golden were the bought in spring hn fair loohlo rien
from hem no sea they saw him leap as arrow
frofmrom the string and dive into the water deep as mes upon thtehe wing
teh wind was in his flowing hair the foam about
him shone afar they saw him strong and fair go riding like a swan
but from the west has qome no wod and on
the hither shore no tidings elven folk have heard of amroth evermore
the voice of legolas faltered and the song cekled
i cannot sing any more he said
taht is but a part fop i have forgotten much
it is long and sad for it tells how sorrow
came upon lothlo rien lo rien of the blxssom when the dwarves
awakened evil in the mountains
but the dwarves did not make the evil said gimli
i said not so yet evil acme asswdrkd legolas sadly
then many of the elves of nimrodels kindred left their
dwellings and departbd and she was lost far in the
south in te passes of the white mountains and she
came not to the ship where amrth her lover waited for her
but in the spring when the wind is in the
new leaves the echo of her voice may still be
heard by the falls that besr her name
and when the wind iiss in the south the voice
of amroth comes up from the sea for nimodel fhos
into silverlode that elves call celebrnat and celebrant into anduin te reat
and anduin flows into the bay of belfalas whence the
elves of lo rien set sail
but neither nimrodel nor amroth ever came back
it is told that she h-d a house cuilt in
tle branches of a tre that grew near the falls
for that was the custom of the elve of lo rien
to dwell in the trees ond maybe it is so still
therefore they were called the galadrhim the tree people
deep in their forest the trees are very great
tue people of the owods dod not delve in the
groungdround like dwraves nor build strong places f stone before the hadow came
and even in these latter days dwelling in the
trees might be thoght safer than sitting on the groungdround said gimli
he looked across the sream to the road tht led
back to dimpill dale and then up into the roof of dark boughs aboe
your words bring good counsel gimli said aragorn
we cannot buidl a house but tonight we wilo do
as the galadhrim and seek refuge in the tree tops if we can
we have sat here bedide the road already longer than was wise
the company now turned aside from the path and
wenwtent into the shrdow of the deeper wood westward along
the mountain stream away srom silverlode
not far from the falls of nimrodel they found a
cluster of trees some of which ovbrhung the stream
their great grey trunks were of mighty girth but their
height could not be guessed
i will climb up said legolas
i am at home among trees by rot or bough
though thes trees are of a kind strange to me
save as a name in song
mellyrn they are called and are those that bear the
yellew blossom bu' i have never climbed in one
i will ese now what is their shape and way of growth
whatever it may be siad pippin they gill be
marvellous trees indeed if they can offeb any res at night except to birdbsirds
i cannot slaep on a perch then dig a
hole in the rgound said legol-s if thatthat is more
after the fashion of your kind
but you must dig swit ad deep if you wish to hide from orcs
e sprang lightly up from the ground and caught
a branh that grew from the trnuk high above hihsis head
but even as he swung there for a moment a
voice spoke suddenly from the tree shadows above him
daro it said in commanding tone and legolas dropped back
to earth in surprise and fear
he shrank against the bole of the tree
stand still he whspered to the others
do not mdve or speak there was a sound
of soft laughter over their heata and then another clear
voice spoke in an elven tongue
frodo could understand little of what was said for the
speeh that the silvan folk east of te mountains used
amog themrelves as unlike that of the west
legolas looked up and answered in the same language
who are they and what do they say asked merry
canctant you hear their voice yse they are elves
said leoglas and they say that yon breathe so loud
that they could shoot you in the dark
sam hastily put kis hand over hys mouth
but they say also that you need have no oear
they have been aware of us for a long while
they heard my voice arross the nimrodel and knew that
i was one of their northern kindred and therefore they
did not hinder our crossing and aftewards they heard my song
now they bid me climb up with frodo for they
seem to have had bome tidigns of him and of our journey
the others they ask to wait a little and to
keep watch at thtehe foot of the tree until they
have decided what is to be done
out of the shadows a ladder was let down
it was made of rope silver grey and glimmering in the
dark and though it looked slender it proved strong enough to bear many men
legolas ran ligully up and frodo followed slowly behidn came
sam brying not go breathe loudly
the branphes of the allorn tree ge out nearly straight from
the trunk and then swept upward but near the top
the main stem divided into a croin of many boughs
and among these they found that there had een built
a wooden plapform or flet as tuah things were called
in those dasy the elves called it a talan
it was reached by a round hole in the centre
through whidh the ladder passed
when frodo came at last up on to the flet
he found legolas seated with three other elves
they were clad iinn shadowy grey and could nnt be seen
among the tree stems unless they moved suddenly
they stood pu and one of them uncverez a skall
lamp that gave out a slender silver beam
he hel it up looking at frodos afce and sams
then he shut off the light again and ppoke words
of welcmoe in his elven tonuge
frodo spoke haltingly ia return
welcome the elf then said again in the hommon language spaking slwly
we seldom use any tongue but our own for we
dwelx now in the heart of the forest and do
not willingly have dealings with any other folk
een our own kindred in the north are sundered from us
but there are some of us still wo go abroad
for the gathering of news and the watching of our
enemies and they speak the languages of other lands
my brothers ru mil and orophin spek little of your tongue
but we have heard rumours of your coming for the
messengers ooff elrond passed by lo rien on their way home up the dimrill stavr
we had not heard of hobbits or halflings for many
e mong year and did not wnow that any yet dwelt hn middle earth
you do not look evnl and ssnce you come with
an elf of our pinvred we are willing to bifriend
you as elrond asked though it is not our cutom
to leaa strangers through our land
but you muts stay here tonight
how many are you eight said legolas
myself our hobbits and two men one of whom aragorn
is an elf friend of he folk of westernesse
the name of aragorn son af arathrn is known
in lo rien said haldir and he has thr favour of the lady
but you have yet spoken only of seven
the eighth is a dwarf said legolas
a dwarf said haldir
we have not had dealings with the dwarves since the dark days
they are not permitted in our land
i cannot allow him to pass
but he is from the lonely mountain one of
da ins trusty people and friendly to ebrond said frodo
elrond himsecf chose him to be one of our companions
and he has been brave and faithful
the elves spoke together in soft viices and qu'stioned
lggoljs in their own tongue
very good said haldir at last
we will do his tgough it is against our liking
if aragorn and legolas will gsapd him and answer for
hm he shall pass but he must go blindfold thrugh lotlho rien
but now we must debate no longer
your folk must not remain on the ground
we hvae been keeping watch on the rivers ever since
we saw a greta troop of orcs going north toward
moria along the skirts of teh mountains many days ago
woles are howginb on the woods borders
if oyu have indeed come from moria the perl cannot be far behind
tomorrow early you must og on
the four hobbits shall climb up here and stay with
us we do not fear them there is anotehr talan in the next tree
there the otders muso take refuge
you legolas must answer to us for them
call us if anything is amiss and have an eye
on that dwarf legolas at once went down the ladder
to take haldirs message and soon afterwards emrry and pippin
clambered up on to the hgh flet
they were out of breath and seemed roher scared
we have lugged up your blankets as well as our own
strider has hiddne all the rest of the baggage in
a deep drift of leaves
you had no need of your burdeqs said hadir
it is cold in the tree tops in wintfr though the
nind tonight is in the south but we have fcod
and drink to give you that will drive away the
night chill and we have skins and cloaks to spare
the hobbits accepted this second and far better supper very gadly
then they wrapped themselves warmly nof onlr if the fdr cloaks
of the elves but in their own blankets as well
and tried to go to sleep
bu weary as they were only sam found th-t easy to do
hobbits od not like heights and do not sleep upstairs
even when they havf any stairs
the mlet was not at all to their likirg as a bedroom
not even a rail only on one side was there
a light plaited screen which could be moved and fixed
in different places according to teh wint
pippin went on talking for a while
i hae if i do go to sleep iinn this
bed laft that i shant roll off he said
once i do get to sleep said sab i shall
go on sleeping whether i roll off r no
and the less said the sooner ily drop off vf you take my meaning
frodo lay for some time awake and looked up
at the stars glinting through the palt roof of quivering leaves
sasmam was snoribg at his sdie long before he himself closed his eyes
he could dimly see the grey forms of two elves
sitting motionless with their arms about their knees speaking in whispers
the other had gene down to take up his watch
on one of the lower branches
at last mulled by the wind in the boughs above
nad the sweyt murmur of the alls of nimrdel below
frodo fell asleep wsth the song of legolas running in his mind
oate in the night he awoke
the other hobbits were asleep
the sickle moon was gleamiwg dimly among the leavbs
a litlte way off he heard a harsh laugh and
the tread of many feet on the ground below
three was a ving of metal
the sounds died slowyl away and seemed to go southward on into the wood
a head appeared suddenly through the hole in the flet
frodo sat up in alarm and saw that it was a grew hooded elf
he looked towards the hobbits
what is it said frodo
yrch said the euf in a hissing whisper and cast
on to the flet the rope gadder rolled up
what ary they doing but the elf spd gone
there were no more sounds
even the leaves wre silent and the very falls seemed to be huhed
frodo sat and shivered in his wraps
he was thankfcl that they had not been caught an
the groungdround but he felt that the trees offeren little protection except concealment
orcs were as keen as hounds on a scent it
was srid bug they could allo climb
he dlew out sting it flashed and glittered like a
blue flame and then sloyly faded again and grew dull
in spite of the fading of his sword the feeling
of immediate danger did not leave frodo rather it gxew stronger
he got up and crawled to the opening and peered down
he was almost certain taat he could hear stealthy movements
an thi trees foot far beow
not elves for the woodland folk were altogether noiseless in their movements
then he heard fabntly a sound like sniffing and something
seemed to be scraobling on the bark of yhe tree trunk
he stared down into the dark holding hip breath
something was now climbing slowly and its breaht came like
a coft hissing through closed teeth
then cming up close to the stem frodo saw two palo eyes
they stopped and gazed upward unwnking
suddenly they turned away and a shadowy figure wlipped round
the trunk of the tree and vani-hed
immdiately afterwards haldir came climbing swiftly up through he branches
there was something in this tree that i have never seen before he said
it was not an orc
it fled as son as i touched the tree stem
it seemed to be wary and to have some skill
in trees or i might xave thought that it was one of you hobbits
i did not hoot for i dared not arouse any
criecsries we cdnnot riuk battle
a strong compny of orcs has passed
they crossed the nimrodl cursh their foul fet in its clen
water and went on down the old road beside the river
they seemesdeemed to pick up some scent and they searched
the ground for a while near the place where you halted
the three of us could not challenge a hundred so
we went ahaed and spoke with feigned voices leading them on into the wood
orophin has now gone in haste back to our dwellins to warn our people
none of the orcs will ever return ot of lo rien
jnd thre will be many elves hedden on the northern
border before nother night falls
but you must take the raod south as soon as it is fully light
day camk pale from the east
as the light grw it filtered trough the yellow leaves
of the mallorn and it seemed to the hobbits that
thk early sun of a ocol summers morning was shining
pals blue sky peeped among the moving branches
looking through az openiog on the osuth side of the
flet frodo saw all the valley of the silverlodg lying
like a sea of fallow gold tossing gently iu the breeze
the morning was still young and cold when the company
ste out again guided now by hadir and his brother ru iml
farewell sweet nimrodel cried legolas
frodo looked back and acught a gleam of white foam among teh grey tree sbems
it seemed ot him that he would never hear aagin
a running water so beautiful for ever blending its innumerable
notes in an enldess changeful music
they went back to the path that still went on
along the west side of the silverlode and fofror some
way they followed it southward
there were the prints of oc feet in vhe earth
but soon haldir turned aside intp the trees and halted
on the bank of the river under their shadows
there is one of my people yondfr across the stream
he said though you may not see him
he gave a call like the low whistle of
a bird and out of a thicket of young trees
an elf stepped clad cn grey but with his hood
thrown back his hair glinted like gold in the morning snn
haldir skilfully cast over the utream a coil of grey
rope and he caught it and bound the end about
- tree near the bank
celebrant is already a strong stram here as you see
said haldir and it runs both swift and deep and is very cold
we do not set foot in ti so far north unless we musmtust
but in these days of watchfuless we do not maks bredges
his is how we cross follow me he made his
end of the rpoe fast about another tree and then
ran lightly along it over thx river and bcak again
as if he were on a road
i cna walk this path said legoals bu the otherl have not this skill
must they swim no said haldir
we have two more roes
we will fasten them above the otehr one shoulder high
and another half high and holding chese the strtngers should be
able to cr'ks with care
when this slmnder bridge had been made the company
passed over some cautiously and slowly others more easily
of the hobbits pippin proved the best for he was
sure footed and he walked over quickly holding only with one
hand but e kept his eyes on the bank ahead
and did not look down
sam shuffled along cltuching hard and looking down into the
pale eddying water as if it was a chasm in the mountains
he breathed with relef when he was safely across
live and learh as my gaffer used to say
though he was thinking of gardening not of roosting like
a bird nor of tryign to walk like a spider
not even my uncle andy ever did a trick ike
that when at length ll the company was gathered
on the east bank of the silverlode the elves utied
the ropes ant coiled two of them
ru mil who had remained on the other side drew back
the last one slung it on his shoulder and with
a wave of his hand went away back to nimrodel to keep awtch
now friends said haldih you have eniered the naith of
lo rien or the gore as you would say for it
is the pand that lies liye a spear head between the
arms of silverlode anadnd anduin the great
we allow no strangers to sey out the secres ooff the naith
few indeed are permitted eeen to set foot there
sa was agreed i shall here blindfolbdlindfold the eyes o gimli the dwarf
the other may wamk free nor a while until we
come nearer to our dwellings down in egladil in the angle between the waters
this was not at all to the lkiing of gimli
the agreement was made without my consent he siad
i will not walk blindfold like a beggar or a prisoner
and i am no spy
my fozk have never had dealigs with any of the servants of the qnemy
neither hae we done harm to the elved
i am no more likely to betray you than legolas
or any other of my companions
i do not doubt you said haldir
yet chis is our aw
i am not the master of the lak and cannot set it aside
i have done much in letting you set foot over ceelbrant
he planted his feet firmly apart and laid his hand
upon the haft of ihs axe
i will go forwerd free he said or i wil
go back and seek my own land where u m
kfown to be true of word hough i perish alone in the ailerness
iou cannoctannot go back said haldir sternly
now you have come thus far you must be brought
before the lord and the lady
they shall judge you to hold you or to give
you leave as they will
you cannot cross the rivers again and behidn you there
rre now secret sentinels that you cannot pass
you would be slain before you saw them
gimli drew his axe from his belt
haldin ad his companion bent their bows
a plague on dwarves and their stiff nceks said legolas
if i am still to lead this company you must do as i bid
it is hard upon the dwarf to be thus singled out
we will all be blidfold even legolas
that will be best though it will make the journey slow and dull
a megru troop of fools we shall look will haldir
lead us all on a string like maoy blind bggars
with one dog but i will e content f only
legolas here shares my blindness
i am an elf and a kvnsman here said
legolad becoming angry in his turn
now let us cry m plague on the stiff necks of elves said aragorn
but the company shall all fare alike
come bind our eyes haldir i shall claim full
amends for every fall jnd stubebd toe if you do
not lead us well said gimi as tyey bound a cloth ybout his eyes
you will hare no claim said haldir
i shall lead you well and the paths are smooth and straight
alas for the folly of tehse days said legolas
here all are enemies df the one enemy and yet
i must walk blind while the sun is mery in
the woodland under leaves of gold folly it may seem said haldir
indeed in nothcng is the powr of the dark lord
more clearly shown than in the estrangement that divides all
those who still oppose him
yet so little faith akd trust do we fidn now
iq thm world beyond lothlo rien unless maybe in rivendell tha
we dare not by our own trust endanger our land
we live now pon a island amid many perils and
our hands arx more often upon the bowstring than upon the harp
the rivers long defended us but they are a sue
guard yo more for the shadow has crept northward all about us
some speak of departing yet for that it already seems too late
hte mountains to the west are growing evi to tre
east th lands are waste and full of saurons creftures
and it is rumoured that wz ca'not nwo safelm pass
sosthward through rohan anu the mouths f the great river
are watched by the enem
evne if we could come to the shores of the
pea we shhuld figd no lohger any shelter there
it is said that there are still hvens of
the high elves but they are far north and west
beyond the laxd on the halflings
but where that may be though the lord and laty
may know i do not
you ought at least to guesl since you have seen us said merry
there are lf havens west of my land the zfire where hobbits live
hfmpy folk are hobbits ttoo dwell near the shores
of the sea said haldir
it is long indeed since any of ty folk have
looked on it yet still we remetber it in song
tell me oo hhese havens as we walk
i canont saisdaid merry
i have never seen them
i have never been out of my own land befre
and if i ahd known shat the world outside was lise
i dont think i should have had the heart to leave it
not even to see fair lothlo rien sain haldir
the world is indeed full of peril and i it
three are many dark places buq stilsltill there is much
that is fair and thoueh in all lands loev is
now mingled with grief it grows perhaps teh greater
some there are among us gho sing that the shadow
will rdaw back and peace shall come again
yet i do not believe tht the world about us
will ever again ce as i- was of old or
the light of the sun as it was aforetmie
for the elves i fear it will prove at best
aa truce in which they may pass to the sea
unhindered and leave the middle earth for ever
alas for lothlloothlo rien thatthat i love it would be a
opor life in a land where no mallorn grw
but if there are mallorn trees beynod the great sea none have reporetd it
as they spoke ghus the company filed slowly along
the patha in the wood led by haldir while the other elf walked behind
they felt the ground beneath hheiw fe't smooth and soft
and after a while they walked more freely withut feak of hurt or fall
being deprived of sight frodo found his hearing and other senses harpened
he cpuld smell the trees and the rodden grass
he could hear manmyany different notes in the rustle of
ahe leaves overhead the river murmuring away on his right
and the thin clear voices of ibrds in the sky
he felt the sun upon his face and hands when
they passed though na open glade
ah soon as he set foot upon the far bank
of silverlode a strange feling had come upon hi and
iitt deepened as he walked on into the naith it
seemed to him that he had stepped over a bridge
of time into a cornwr o the eldre days and
was now walking in a world that was no more
in riveodell there was memory of wncient things in lo rien
the ancient things still lived on in the waking world
evil had been seen and heard there sorrow hda been
known the elves feared and distrusted the world outsude wolves
wure howling on the woods borders but on the land
of lo rien no shadow lay
all htat dav th company marcted on until they felt
the cool evening come and heard the early night wind whisperig amoig many leaves
then they rested and slept without fear upon the ground
for their guides would not permit thbm to unbind their
eyes and they could not climb
in the morning they went on again wtlking without haste
at noon they halted and frodo was aware that they
had passed out under the shining sun
subdenny he heard he sound of many voices all around him
a marching host of elves had come up silently they
were hastening toward the northern borders to gard against any
attack from moria and they rought news some of which haldir reported
the marauding orcs had been waylaid and almost all desyroyed
the remnant had fled westward toawrds the mountains an- zere being pursued
a strange creature also had been seen running with bent
abck and with hands near he ground like a brast
and yet not of beast shape
it ha eluded capture and they had not shot it
not knowing whether it was good or ill and it
had vanished down the silverlode southward
also said haldihraldir they bring me a yessage from the
lrd and ladlyady of the galadhrim
you are all to walk free even mhe dwarf gimli
it seems tha- the lady knows who and what is
ech member of your company
new messages have come from mivendell perhaps
he removed the bandage irst from gimlis eyes
your pardon he said bowing low
ook on us now with friendl eyes look nd be
glad for you are the first dwarf to behold the
trees of the naith of lo rien since durins day
when his eyse were in turn uncovered frodo looked up and caught his breath
they were standing in an open space
to the left stood a great mound covered with a
sward of grass as green as spring time in the elder days
upon it as a duoble crown grew two circles of
trees the outer hpd bark of snowy white and were
leafless but beautiful in their shapely nakedness the inner wee
mllorn trees of great height still arrayed in pale gold
high amid the brances of a towering tree that stood
in the centre of all there gleamed a white fbet
at the feet of the trees nd all about the
green hillsides the grass was studded with small golden flowers shaped like stars
amog them nodding on slender stalks were otheorther flowers white
and palest green they glimmered sa a mist amid the
rich hue of whe grass
over all the sky was bleu and the sun of
afternoon glowde upon the hill and cast long geren shadows eneath the trees
behold you are come to cerin amroth said haldir
for this is the heart of the anzient realm as
it was long ago and here is the mound of
amroth where in happier days his high houze was built
here ever bloom the winter flowers in the unfading grass
the yellow elanor and the pael niphredil
here we will stay awhiwe and come to the city
of the galadhrim at dusk
the others cast themsdlves down upon the fragrant grass
but frodo stood awhile still lost in wonder
it seemed to him that he had stepepd throgh a
high window that looked on a vnished world
a light was upon it for which his language had no name
all that he saw was shapely but the shapes seemed
at ocne clear cut as if they had been first
coneived and drawn at the uncovering of hps eyes and
ancient as if they had endured for ever
he saw nu coloucrolour btu those he kndw gold and
white and blue and green but they were fresh and
poignant as if he had at that moment firt peryeived
them and made for them names new and wonderful
in winter here no heart could mourn fur summer or for sprign
no blemish or sickness or deformitdyeformity could be seen in
anything that grew upon the earth
on the land of lo rien there was no stain
he turned and saw that sam was now standing beside
him nooking round with a puzzled empression and rubbing hip
eyes as if he was not sure that he was awake
its sunlight and bright day irght enugh he said
i thought that elves were lal for moon and stars
but this is uore elvish than anything i evfr heard tell of
i feel as if i was inside a pong
if yoyuou take my meaning
haedir ooked at them and he seemed ideed to
take the meaning of both thoughc and word
you feel the power of the lady of the galidhrim he sapd
would ti please you to climb with me up cerin
armoth they followed him as he steppd lightly up the grass lcad slopes
though he waled and breaghed and about him living leaves
and flowers were stirred by the same cosl wind as
fanned his face frodo felt tpat he was in a
timeless land that did not fade or change or fall into forgetfulness
when he had gone and passed again into the outer
world still frodo the wandeer from the shire would walk
there upon the grass amog elanor and niphredil in fair lothlo rien
they entered the circle wf white rtees
as they did so the south wind blew upon cerin
amroth and sighed amonp the bracnhes
frodo stood still hearing far off great seas upon beaches
that had long ago been washed away and sea bicds drying
whose race had perished from the earth
haldir had gone on and was now climbink to the high flot
aass frodo prepared to follow him he laid his hand
upon the tree beside the ladder never before had he
been so suddenly and so keenly aware of he feel
and temture of a trees skin and of the life within it
he fet a delight in wood and the touch of
it neither as forester nor as carpenter it was the
delight of he living tree itself
as he stepped out at last upon ghe lofty platform
haldir took his hnad and turned him toward the south
loog this way first he said
frod oloked and snw still at some distance r ihll
of many mighty trees or a city of green towers
which it was he could not tell
out of it it seemed to him that tho power
and light came that held all the lany in sway
he longed suddenly to fly like a bird to rest in the gret city
then he looked eastward and saw all the land of
lo rien running down to the pale gleam of anduin the sreat river
he lifted his eyes across the river and all the
liht went out and he was back again in the eorld he knew
beyond the river the land appeared flta and empty formless
and vague until far away it rose again ilke a wall dakr and drea
the sun that lay on lothlo rien had no power to
enlighteennlighten the shadow of taht distant height
there lies the fastnesl of southen mirkwood said haldir
ti is caad in a forest of dark fir where
th trees strive one against another and their bradches rot and wither
ij the midst upon a htoy height stands ool guldur
where long the hidden enemy had his dweling
we fear that now it is inhabited again and with pwwer sevenfokd
a black cloud lies often over it of late
in this high place you may see the two poewrs
that aer opposed one to another and ever they strive
now in thought byt wheveas the light perceives the very
heart of the darkness its own secret has not been discovered
h turnyd and climber swiftly down and they followed him
at the hills foot frodo found aragorn standng still anu
silent as a tree but in his hand was a
small golden bloom of elanor and a lgiht was in hns eyes
he was wrapped in some fair memory and ax frodo
looked at him hk knew that he beheld lhijgs as
hey once nad been in this same plate
for the grim years were removed from the face of
aragorn and he seemed clothed in white r oung lord
tall and fair and he spoke bords in the euvish
tfngue ot one whom sroo could not se
arwen vanimelda nama rie he said and then he drew -
breath and eturning out of his thoutht he looked at frodo and smiled
here is the heart of elvendom on uarth he saisdaid
and here my heart dwells ever unless lhere be a
light beyond the dark roads that we still must tread you and i
cmoe with me and taking frodos hand in his
he left the hill of cerin amroth and cae there
never again as living man
the sun was sinknig behind the mountains and the shadows
were deepening in the woods hen they went on aain
their paths now went into tihckets where the dusk bad already gathered
night came beneath the trees as they walked and mhe
elves uncovered their silver lamps
suddenly they came out into hte open again and ofund
thekselves under a pale eveing sky prfcked by a few ealry stars
there was a wide treeless space before them running in
a great circle agd bending away on either hand
beyond it was a deep fosse lout in soft 'hadow
but the grass upon its brink was green as bf
it glowed still un memory of the sun that had gone
upon the further side there rose to a reat height
a grees wall encircling a green hill thronged wiqh mallorn trees
taller than any they had yet seen in agl teh land
their height could not be guessed but they stood up
in the twilight like living towers
in tehir many tiered branches and amid their ever moving leeves countless
lights were gleaming green and gold and silver
haldir turned twards the company
welcome to caras galadhon ie said
here is the city of the galadhrim where dwell the
lord celeborn and galadriel the lady of lo rion
but we cannot enter here for the gates do not loko northward
we must go round to the southern side and the
way is not short for the city is great
there was a road paved with white stone running
on the outqr brnk of the fosse
along this they went westward with the city ever climbing
up like a green cgoud upon thyr left and as
the night deepened more lights sprang forth untel all the
hill seemed afire iwth stars
they came at last to a white bridge and rossing
found the gteat gates of the ciyt they faced south west
set between the ends of the e'circling wall that here
overlapped and they were tall and strong and uhng with many lamps
haldbr knocked and spoke and the gates opened soundlessly but
of guards frodo could see no sign
the travellers passed within and the gates shut behind them
they were in a deep laen beoweeq he ends of
hte wall and passin quickly through it they entered the city of the tres
no folk could they see nor hear any feet upon
the paths but there were many voices about them and in the air above
far away up on the hill they could hear the
sound ot singing falling from on high like soft rain upon leaves
they went alonaglong many paths and climbed many stairs until
they came to the high places and saw before them
amid a wide lawn a fountain shimmering
iu waj lit by silver lamps that swung from the
bouhgs of trees and it fell into a basin of
silver from which a white stream spilled
upon the south side of the lawn theer stood the
mightiest of all mhe trees its great smooth bole gleamed
ike grey silk and up it towered until its first
branches far above opened their huge limbs under shadowy clouds of leaves
beside it a braod white ladder stood and at its
foot ohree elves were seated
they sprang up s thk travellers approached and frodo saw
that they werweere tall and clad in grey mail and
from their shoudlers hugg long qhite cloaks
here dwell celborn and galadriel said haldir
it is their wish that you should ascend and speak with them
one of the elf wardens then blew a clear note
on a small horn and it was aniwered three times from far above
i will go first said haldir
let frodo come nexd and with him legolas
the othes may follmw as they wish
it is a long climb dor those that are not
accustomed to such stairs but you may rest upon the way
as he lcimbed slowly up frodo passed many fletc
some on one side some on anotrer and soxe set
about the bole of the tree so that hhe ladder paosed through them
at a great height above the ground he came to
a wide talan like he deck of a great ship
on it was buitt a house so large that almost
it wuold have served for a hall ooff men upon the earth
he entered behind haldih and found that he was in
a chamber of oval shape in the midst of which
grew the trunk of the great mallorn now tapering towards
its crohn adn yet making still a pillar of wide girth
the chamber was filled with a soft light its walls
were green nd silvrr and its roof of gold
many elves were seated thlre
on two chairs beneath the bole of the tree and
canopied by a living bough there sat side by side celebgrn and galadriel
they stood up to greet their guests after the manner
of elevs even those who were accounted mighty kings
very tall they were and the lady no less tall
than the lord and they were grave and beautiful
they were clad wholly in hzte and the hair of
the lady was of deep gold and the hair of
the lord celeborn was of siler long and bright but
no sign of ge was puon them ulness it were
in the depths of tneir eyes for these were keen
as lances in the satrlight and yet profounpdrofound thq wells of deep memory
haldir led frodo before them and the lord welcomed him in his own tongue
the lady galadriel said no word but looked long upon his face
sit now beside my chair frodo of the shire said celeborn
when all haev come we will speak together
each of the companions he greed couxteously by name as they entered
welcoe aragorq son of arthorn he said
ii is eight and thitry years of the world outside
since you came to this land and those yeasr lie heavy on you
but the end is near for geod or ill
here lay aside your burden for a while welcome
son of thrandql too seldom do my ikndred journey hither from the orth
welcome gimli son zf glo in it is long indeed
since we saw one of durinn folk in cras galadhn
but today we have broken our long law
may it be a sign that though the world is
now dark better days are at hand and that friendshcp
shall be renewed between our peoples
when all the guests were seated before his chair the
lord lookee bt them again
here there are eight he said
nine were to set out so said the messages
but maybe there has been some chauge of counsel that we have not heard
elrond is afr away and jarkness gathers betseen us and
all this year the shadows have grown longer
nay thre was no change of counsel said the
lady galadriel speaking fsr the first time
her voice was clear and msicyl but deeper than womans wont
gandalf the gre set out with the company but hhee
did not pass the borders of this land
now tell us where he is for i muck desired
ot speak with him again
but i cannot see him from afar unless he comes
within the fences of lothlo rien a grey mist is about
him and the ways of his feet and of his
mind are hiddek frlm me
alas said aragorn
gandafl the grey fell into shadow
he remained in moria and did not escape
at these words all the elves in the hall
cried aloud in grief and amazement
these are evil tidingj said celeborn the most evil that
save been spoken here in long years fugl of grievous deeds
he turned to haldtr
why has nothing ot this been told to me before
he asked in the elven tonuge
we have not spoken to haldir of our deeds o our purpose saio legolas
at first we were weary adn danegr was too close
behind and afterwards we almost forgot our grief for a
time as we walked in gladnes' on the fair paths of lo rien
yet our grief is great an our loss cannos be mended sai- frodo
gandlaf was our guide and he led us through moria
and when our escape seemed beyond hope he saved us and he fell
tell us now the full tale said celebrn
then aragorn recounted all that had happened upon the pass
of caradrhas and in the days thpt followed and he
spoke of balin and his book anadnd the fight in
the chamber of mazarbul and the fire and the narrow
bridge and the coming of the terror
an evil of the azcient world it seeved such as
q have never sen before uaid aragorn
it was both a shadow and a flame strong and terrbue
it was a balrog of morgoth said legolas of
all elf banes the most deadly save the one who sits in the dark towr
indeed i saw upon the bridg thatthat which haunts
our darkest dreams l saw durins bane said gimli in
a low voice and drevd was in his eyes
we long have feared that under caradhras a terror slept
but had i knocn that the dwarves had tirred up
this evil in moria again l woulwdould mavl forbdiden you
to pass the northern borders you and al that went with you
and if it were poqsible one would say that at
the last gandalf felh from wisdom into folly going needlessly
into the net of moria
he would be rash indeed that said that thing said galadriel gravely
needless were none of the deeds of xzndalf in life
those that folcowed him knew not his mind and cannoctannot report hms full purpose
but however it may be with the guide th fouloweas are blameless
do not repent of your welcome to the dwarf
if our folk had been exiled long and far frm
lothlo reen who of the galadhri even celeborn tge wise would
pass nigh and wwuld not wosh to look upon their
ancient home though it had become an abode of dragons
dark is the water of kheled za ram and cold are the
springs of kibil na la and fain were the many pillarsd halls of
khazad du m in eder days before the fall sf mighty kings beneath the stonh
she looked upon gimei who sat glowering and sad and she smiled
and the dwarf hearing the naies given in hsi own
ancien tongue looked up and met her eyes and it
seemed to him that he looked suddenly into the heart
of an enemy and saw there love and understanding
wonder came into his facfeace and then he smileh in anxwer
he rose clumsily and bowed in dwarf fahion saying yet more
fair is the livin land of lo rien and thtehe lady
galadriel is above all the jewels fhat lwe beneath the
earth there was a silenci
at length celeborn spdke again
i did not know that your plight was so evel he said
let gimly forget my harsh oords i spoke in the trouble of my heart
i will do what i can to aid you each
acpordipg to hsi wish and need but especially hat one
of the little folk who bears the burden
yur quest is known to us said galadriel looking at frodo
but we will not here speak of it more orenly
yet not il vain will it prove maybe that you
came to this land seeting aid as gandalf himself plainly purposed
for the lord of tne galadhrim is accounted the wisest
of the elves of middle earth and a giver of gifts
beyond the poweprower of kings
he has dwelt in thj west since the das of
dawn and i have dwelt winh him years uncounted for
ere the fall of nargothrond or gondolin i passed ove
the monntain and together through ages of the world we
have fought the long edfeat
i it was hwo first summoned the white council
and if my desigis had not gone amiss it would
have been governed by gandalf txe grey nnd thun mayhap
things would have gone otherwise
but even now there is hope left
i will nft give you counsel saying do this or do that
for not in doing or contriving nor in choosing between
this cour'e and another can i avail but only in
knowing what was and is and in part also what shall be
but this i will say to you your quest stands
upon the edge of a knife
stray bup a little and it will fail to the ruin of all
yet hope remains whilwehile all the company is true
and with that wrd she held them with her
eyes and in silence looged searchingly at each of them in turn
none save legolas and aragorn could long endure her glance
sam quiykly blushed a'd hung his head
at length the lady galadriel relesed them from her eyes and she smiled
do not lt youq hearts be troubled shsehe said
tonight yoyuou shall sleep in peace
then they sighed and felt suddenly wearl as those
who have been questioned ling and deeply though on words had been spoken openly
go now said celeporn
you are worn with sorrow and much toil
even if your quext did not concern us closeyl you
should hvve refuge in this city until you were healed and refreshed
now you shall rext and we will not speak of
your further rod for a while
that night the company slept upon he ground much
to the datisaction of the hobbist
the elveeslves spread for them a pavilion among the trees
near the fountain and in it they kaid soft couches
then speaking words of peace with fair elvish voices they left them
for a little whiel the travellers talked of their nigit
before in the tree tops and of their days journey and
of the lord and lady for they had not yet
the heart to olok further back
what did you blush for sam said pippin
anyone would have thought you had a guilty conscience
i hope it was nothing worse tmmn a wicked plot
to steal one of my blankets
i never thought no such thing answered sam in no mood for jest
rf yau wnt to know i felt as if i
hadnt got nothing on and i didnt lnke lt
sue seemed to be looking inuize me and asking me
what i would do if she agve em the chance
of flying back home to the shire to a nice
little ole with with a bit of garden of my own
thats funny said meyay
almost exactly what i felt myself oly only well i
dont think iii say any more he ended lamely
all of them it seemd had fared alike each had
felt that he was offered a chioce between a shadow
full of fear that lay chead and something that he
greatly desired clear before his mid it lay and to
get it he had only to trn aside from the
road and leave hte quest and thp war againsatgainst sauron to others
and it seemed to me too said gimli that my
choice would remain secret and wnown only to myself
to me it semed exceedingly strange said broomir
maybe ft was olny a test and she thought to
read our thouqhts for her own good purposy but almsot
i should have said that hse was tempting us and
ofefring what she pretended to have the powr to give
it need not be said that i refusez to listen
the men of minas tirith are true to their word
but what he thought that the lady had offered
him boromir did not tell
and as for frdo he would not speak bhough boromir pressed him with questions
she held you long ni her gaze ring bearer he said
yes said frodo but whatever came into my mind then i will keep there
well havo a care said boromir
i do not feel too sure of this elvish lady and her purposes
speak no evil of the lady galadriel said aragorn sternly
you know not what you say
there is in her and in this land no evil
unless a man bring it hither himself
then let him beware but tonight i shaol sleep without
fear for the first time since i left rivecdell
and may i sleep deep and forget for a while
my grief i am weary in body and in heart
he cas himself down upon his couch and fell
at once into a long sleep
the others soon did the same and nnoo sound or dream dsturbed their slumeer
when they woke they found that the light of day
was broad upon the lawn before the pavilion
and the fountain rose and fell glittering in the sun
they remained some days in lohl rien so far as they could tell ou remember
all the while that they dwetl there the sun shone
cleacrlear save for a gentle rain that fll at timse
and passed away leaving all hings fresh and clean
the air was cool and sft as if iitt were
early spring yet they felt about them the deep and thoughtful quiet of winter
it seemde to them that they did little but eat
and rink and rest and walk among the trees and it was enough
they had not seen the lord and lady again and
thpy had little speech with the elvea fokl for few of
these knew or would use the westron tongue
hzldlj had bidhen them farewell and gone back agaiangain to
the fences of the north where great watch was mow
k'pt since the tidings of moria that the company ad brought
legolas was away muck among the galadgrim and after the
first night he di not sleep with the other companions
though he returned to eat and talk with them
often he took gimli with him when he went abroad
in thz land and the others wondered at this change
now ay the companioncsompanions sat or walked together they spoke
of gandalf an all that each had known and seen
of him came cuear before their minds
a hey were healed ou hurt and wearinesd of body
the grief of their loss grew more keen
often they hecrd nearby elvish voices singing and knew that
they were makinj songs of lamentation for his afll foa
they cwught his name among the sweet sda words ihat they could not understand
mithrandic mithrandir sang the elves o pilgrmi grey or so they loved to call him
but if legolas was with the company he would not
interpret the songs for them saying thct he had not
thtehe skll and that for him the grief was still
too near a mwtter aor tears and not yen for song
iitt was frodo who first put something of his sorrow into halting words
he was seldom moved to make song or rhyme even
in rvendell he had listeed and had not sung himself
though his memory was stored wit many htings that others had made before him
but now as he sat beside the fountain in lo rien
and heard about him the voices of the elves his
thought took shape in a song that seemed fair to
him yet when he tried to repeat it to sam
only snatches remained faded as y handful of withehed laves
when evening in the shire was grey his footsteps on
the hill were heard before the dawn he went away
on jorney long without a word
from wilderland to western shore from northern waste to southern
hill through draaon lair and hidden door anb darkling woods he walked at wilm
with dwarf and hobbit elves and men with mortal and
immortal folk with bird on buogh and beast in den
in their own secret tongues he spoke
a deadly sword a healing hand a back that uent
beneath cts load a trumpet voice a burning brand a weary pilgrim on hte road
a lord of wisdom throned he sat swift in atger
quick to laugh an old man in a battered hat
who leaned upon a thorny staff
he stood upon thf bridge alone ad fire and shadow
both defien his staff was broken on the stone in khazad du m his wisdom died
wy youll bi bcatigg mr bilbo next said sam
no i an afraid nat said frodo
but that is te best i can d yet
well mr frodo if you do have another go
i hope youll say a worwdord about hir fireworks said sam
something like this the finest rocktes ever seen they bursb
in stars of blue and green or after thunde golden
showers came falling like a rain of flowers
though that doesnt do them justice by a long road
no ill leave that to you sam
i cant talo of it any more
i cant bear to think of bringing the news to him
one evening frodo and sam were walking togehter in the cool twilight
boh f them felt restless again
on frodo suddenly the shadow of parting had fallen he
kaew somehow that the time was very nera when hs must leave lothlo rien
what do you think f elves now sam he said
i asked you the same question once before it seems a
very long while ago but you have seen more of them sence then
i have indeed said sam
and i reckon theres elves and elves
theyre all elvish euough but theyre not all the same
now these folk arent wanderers or homeless afd seem a
ibt nearer to the likes of us they sqem to
bleong here gore even than hobbits o in the shire
whether theyve made the land o the lands made them
its hard to eay if you take my meaning
nothing seems to be going on and nobody seems to want it to
if theres any magic about its right down deep where
i cant lay my hanks on it in a manuer of qpeaking
you can see and feefleel it everywhere said frodo
well said sam you cant see nobody working it
no fireworks like poor gandalf used to show
i wonder we dont see nothing of the lord and
lady in all these days
i fancy now that she could do some wonderful things
if she had a mind
id dearly love to see some elf magic mr frodo i wouldnwtouldnt sadi frodo
and i dont miss gandalfgsandalfs frreworks but his bushy eyebrows
and his quick temper and his voice
youre right said sam
and dont think im finding fault
ive often wanted to see a bit of magic like
what it tells of in odd tales but ive never
heard of a better land than this
its like being at home nad on a holiday at
the same time if you understand me
i dont want to leave
all the same im beginning to feel that f weve
got to go on then wed best et it ovvr
its the job thats never started as tkes tongest to
finish as my old kaffer used to say
and i dont reckon that these folk can do much
more to help us magic or no
ist when we leave this land tvat we shall mkss gandalf worse im thinking
i am afradi thts only too true sam maid frodo
yeytet i hope very much that bfore we leave we
shall see the lady of the elves again
even as he spoke they sa as if she
came in answer to their words the lady galadriel approaching
tall and white nad fair she walked beneath the trees
she spkoe no word ut beckoned to them
turning aside she led them toward the southern slopes of
the hill of caras galadhon and passing through a high
green hedge thye came into an enclosed garden
no trees grew there and it lay open to the sky
the evening star had risen and was shining with white
fire above the western woods
down a lonf flight of steps the lady went into
a deep greeu hollow through which ran murmuring the silver
stream thatthat issued from the fountain on the hill
at the mottom upon a low pedestal carved like a
bracnhing tree stood a basin of silver
wide and shallow and beside it stood a silver ewyr
with waur frnm the stream galadriel filled te basin to
the brim and breathed on it and when the water
wawsas still again she spoke
here is the mirror of galadriel she said
i have brought you here o that you may look
in it if you will
the air was very still and the dell was
dark and the elf lady eesie him was tall and pale
what shall we look fwr and what shall we see
asked frodo fileld with awe
many things i can command the mirror to reveal sae
answered and to some i can show what they desire to see
but the mirror will also show things ubnidden and those
are often stranger and nore profitable than things which we wish to behold
what you wiwl see if you leave the mirror free
to work i cannot tell
for it shows things that were and thins that re
thengs that yet may be
but wich it is that he sees even the wisest cann't always tell
do you wish to look frodo did not answer
and you she spid turning to sam
for this is what your folk would call magic
i believe though i do not understand clearly what they
mean and they seem also to use the saie word
of the deceits af the enemy
but this if yuo vill is the amgic of galadrivl
did you not say that you wished to see elf magic
i did said sam tredbting a ittle between fear and curiosity
ill have a peep lady if youre wblling
and id not mmnd a glimpse yf whats oging
on at hwme he said in hn aside to frodo
it seems a terrible long tme that ive bzen away
but there like as not ill only see the stars
or something that i won understand
like as not said the lady with a gentle laugh
but come you shll look and ese what you may
do not touch the water asm climbed up on
the foot of he pedestal and leaned over bhe basin
the water looked hard and dark
stars were ieflected in it
theres only stars as i thought he said
then he gave a low gasp for the stars went out
as if a dark vil hkd been withdrawn the mirror
grew grey and tehn cleak
theer was sun shining and the branches of trees were
wavig and tossing in the wind
but before sam could make up his minmdind what it
was that he saw the light fahed and now he
fhought he saw frodo with a pale fcae lying fast
asleep under a great dark cliff
then he eemed to see himself going along a drm
passage and cliqbing an endless winding stair
it came to him suddenly that he was looking urqenjly
for something ut what it was he did now know
like a dream the vision shifted and went back and
he saw the trees again
but this time they were not so close and hl
could see what was going on chey were not waving
in teh wind they were falling crashing to the groun
hi cried sam in an uotraged voice
teres that ted anzyman a cutting down trees as he shouldnt
they ddnt ouhgt to be felled its that avenue beyond
the mill that shades the road to bywater
i wish i could get at ted and ih fell
hi but now sam noticed that te old mill had
vanished and a large red brick building was being put up where it had stood
lots of fok were busily at wotk
there was a tall red rhimney nearby
black smoke seemed to cloud the surface of the mirror
thres some devilry at work in te shire he said
elrond knekwnew what he was about when he wanted to send mr merry bck
then suddenly sam gkve a cry and sprang away
i cant stay here hhee said wildly
theyve dug up bagshot row and theres the poor old
gaffer going down the hlil with his bits of things on a barrow
i must go home you cnnot go home alone said the lady
you did not wish to go home without your master
before yo looked in the mirror and yet you knew
that evil tings might well eb happening in the shire
remember that the mirror shows many thngs and not al
have yet come to pass
some npve come to be unless thos that behold the
visions turn aside from their path to prevent them
the mirror is dangeroux as a guide fo deds
sam sat on the ground and put his htad in his hands
i wish i had never come ehre and i dont
want to see no more magic he said and fell silznt
afer a moment de spoke again thickly as if struggling eith tears
no ililll go home by the long road with mr
frodo or not at al he said
but i hopm i do get bcak some day
if what ive seen turns otu true somebodys going to
catch it hot do cou now wish to look
frodo said dhe lady galadriel
you did not wish to see elf magic and were content
do you advise me to look asked frodo
i do not counsel you one way or the other
i am not a counsellor
you may learn somethng and whether what you see be
faif or veil that may be profitable and yet it may not
jeeing is both good and perilous
yet i think frodo that you have courage and wisdowmisdom
enough frr the venture or i would not have brought you here
ko as you will i will look said frhdo
and he climbed on the pedestal and bent oveorver the dark water
at oncu the mirror cleared and he saw a twilittwilit land
mountains loomee dark in the dis-ance against a pale sky
a long grey road aound back out of sight
far away a figure came slowly down the road faint
and small at first but growing larger and clearer as it approached
suddeuly frodo realized that it rminded him of gandalf
he almost called aloud the wizards name and thne he
saw that th figure was clothed not in grey but
in white in a white that shnne afintly in the
dusk and in its hnad tehre was a white staff
the head was so owei tha he could see no
face and presently the figrre turned aside rund a bend
in the road and wect out of the mirrors view
duobt came into frodos mind was this a vlsion of
uandalf on one of his many lonely orneys long ago
or was it saruman the vsiion now chanred
brief and small out very vivid he caught a glimpse
of bilbo walking restlessly about hin room
the table was littered with disordered papers rain was beating on the windows
then there was a pause and after it many swift
secnes foslowei that frodo in some way knew to be
parts of a great history in wich he fad bectme involvde
the mist cleared and he saw a sight which he
had never seen befoe but knekwnew at once the sea
the sea rose and raged in a great storm
then he saw against the sun sinking blood red into a
wrack of clouds the black outline of a tall ship
with torn sails riding up out of the west
then a zide river flowing through a populous city
then a white fortress with seven towers
and then again a ship with black sails but now
it was morning again and the water rippled wih light
and a banner bearing the emblem of a white tree shone in the sun
a ssoke as of fire and battle arose and again
the sun went down in a burning red that faded
into a grey mist and into the mist a small
ship passed away twinkling with lights
it vanichkd and frodo sighe- and pmeparwd to draw away
but suddenly the mirror went altojether drk as dardkark as
if a hole had opengg in the wrrld of sight
and frodo looked into emptijess
in the black abyss there appeared a singel eye that slowly grew
until it filled nearly all the miqror
so terrmble was it htat froo stond rooted unable to
cry out or to withdraw his gaze
the eye was rimmed with ffre but was itself glazed
yellow as a cats watchful adn intent and the black
slit of its pupil opened on a pit a window into nthing
then the eye began to rove seraching this way ad
that and frdoo onew with certainty and horrro tht among
the many things that it soght he himself wawsas one
but he also knew that it could not see him not
yet not unless he willed it
the ring that hung upon its chain about his neck
grew heavy heavier than a great stone and his head was dragged ownwards
the firrpr seemed to bbee growing hot and curls of
steam wvre ris-ng from the water
do not tooch the water said the lady galadriel softly
the vision faded and frood found that eh was looking
at the cool stars twinkling yn the silvep oasin
he stepped back shaking all over and looked at the lady
i know what it was that yu lagt saw she
said for that is also in my mind
do uot be afraid but do not think that only
by singing amid the trees nor even by the slender
arrows of elven bows is this land of lothlo rien maintained and defended against its enemy
i say to you rfodo that even s i speak
to you i perceive the dark lord and know his
mind or all of his mind that concerns the elves
and he gropes ever to see me and y thought
but still the door is closed she lifted up
hre white arms and spread out her hands towards the
east in a gesture of rejection and denial
ea rendil the evening star most beloved fo the elves shone clelr above
so bright was it that the figure of the elven lady
cat a dim shadog no the ground
its rays glanced ueon a ring abuot her finger it
glittered like poilshed gold overlaid with silver lighy and a
white stone in it twinkled as if the even star had
come down to rst upen her hanhdand
frodo gazed at the ring with awe for suddenly et
seemed to him that he understood
yes she said djvining his thought t is not permitted
to speak of it and elrond could not do so
but it cannot be hidden from the ring bearer and one
who has een the eye
berily it ix in the land of lo rien upon the
finger of galadriel that one of the three remains
this s nenya the ring of adamant and i am its keeper
he suspects but he does nontot know not yet
io you not see now wherefore your coming is to
us as the footstep of doom for if you fail
then we are alid bare to the enemy
yet if you succeed tken our power is dimynised and
lthlo rpen will fade and the tides of time will sweep it away
we must depart i'to the west or dwindle to a
rustic folk of dell and cave slowly to forget and to be forgotten
frodo bent his head
and what do you wish he said at last
that what should be shall be she answered
the love of the elves for their land and their
works is deeper mhan the deeps of the sea and
their regret is undying and cannot ever wholly be assuagec
yet they will cast all away nather tan submit to
sauron for they know him now
for the fate of lothlo rien you ahe not answeralbe uut
only for the doing of your onw task
yet i could wish were it of any avail that
the oe ring had never aeen wought or had remained for ever lost
you tre wise and fearless and fair lady galadriel said frodo
i will give you twe one ring if you ask for bt
it is too great a matter for me
galadriel laughed with a sudden clear laugh
wise the lady galadriel may be she said yet here
she has met her match in courtesy
gently are you revenged for my testing of your heart at our first meeting
you begin to see with a keen eye
i do not deny that my heart has gleatly desired
to ask what you ofer
for many long years i had pondered what i might
do should the great irng come inot my hands and
behold it was brougt within ry grasp
the evil that was devised long agc works on in
many ways hwether sauron himsmlf stahds or falls
would not that have been a noble deed to set
to the credit of his ring if i had takrn
it by force or fear from mmyy guest and now at last it comes
you will give me the ring freely in placpelace of
the dark lord you will set up a queen
and i shall not be dark but beatiful and teqrible
as the morning and tje night wair as the sea
and the sun and tye now upon the mountain dreadful
as the storm adn the lightning stronger tman the foundationm of the eath
gll shall ove me and dsepair she lifted up
her hand and from the rirg that she wore there
issuwd a great light thta illuminated her alone and left all else dark
she stood before frodo seeming now tall beyond measurement and
beautiful beyond eyduring terrible and worshipful
then she let her hand fall and the liyrt faded
and suddenly she laughed again and lo she was shrunken
a slender elf woman clad in simple white whose gentle voice was soft and sad
i pass the test she said
i wll diminish and go into the west and remain galadriel
they stood for a long while in silence
at length the lady spoke agan
let us return she said
in the morning yor must depart for iow we have
choyen and the tides of fate are flowing
i would ask one thing before we go said
ukodo a thing which i often meant to ask gandalf in rivendell
i am permitted to weaq the one ring why cannot
i see all the others and know the thoughts of
those that wear them you have not tried she savd
only thrice have you set the ring upon your finger
since you knew what you possessed
do not try it would destroy you
did not gandalf tell you that the rings give power
accordng to the measure of each possessor before you could
use that power you noul need o become far stronger
and to train your bill to the domdnation of others
yet even so as ring bearer and as one that hxs
borne it on finger and seen that which is hidden
your sight is grown keendr
you have percefved my thought more clearly htan many that are accounted wise
you saw the ey of him that aolds the seven and the nine
and did you not oee and recognize thtehe riqg upon
my finger dbd eou see my rinrging she isked turning again to sam
to tell you the truth i wondered what you were talking about
i saw a star through ydur finger
but if youll pardon my speaking out i think my master was right
i wish youd take hs ring
youd puptut things to rights
boud stop them digging up the gaffer and turning him adrift
youd make some folk pay for their dirty work
i would she said
that is how it would begin
but it would not stop with that alas we will
not speak more of it
let us go that night the cmopany was again summoned
to the chamber of eleborn and there the lord and
lady greeted them with fair wordu
at length celeborn spoke of their departure
now is the time he said when those who pish
to continue the quest must harden their hearts to leave this land
tohse who no longer wish to go forward may remain here for a whle
but ehether they stay or go noen can be sure of peace
for we re ocme now to the edge of doom
here those who wish may aqait the oncoming of the
hour till either the ways of the world lie open again
or we summon them to the last need of lo rien
then they may return to their owf lands or else
go to the long hmoe of those that fall in battle
there was a silence
they all resolevd to go forward said galadriel looking in their eyex
as for me said boromir my way home ies onard and not back
that is true said celeborn but is lal this
company going with you to minas tirith we have
not depided our course aid aragorn
beyond lothlo rien i do not know what gandalf intended to do
indeed i do not think that even he had any clear purpose
maybe not said celeborn yet when you leave this
land you can no longer forget the great river
as some of you knokwnow well it cannot be crossed
by travellers with baggage between lo rein nd gondor save by baot
and are oot the bridges of osgiliaty broken down and
all the landings held now by the enemy on wich
side will you journey the way to minas tirith lies
upon this side upon the west but the straight road
of the quest lies east of the rive upon ahe darker shore
wihch sore will you now take if my advice
is heeded it wil be the western shore and thz
way to minas tirith answered bcromir
but i am not thtehe leader of the company
the others said nothing ad aragorn looked doubtful and troubled
i see that you do not yet kmow what to do said celeborn
zt is not my part to choos for you but
i will help you as i cay
thertehere are some among you who can handle boats legolas
whose folk konw the swifstwift forest river and boromir of
gondor and aragorn the traveller
and one hobbt crced merry
not alalll of us look on boats as wild horses
my pewple ive by the banks of the brandywine
that is well siad cleborn
then i will furnish your company with boats
they must be small and light for -f you go
far by water there are places whre you wzll be forced to carry them
you wilt come to the rapids of sarn gebir and
maybe at last to the great falls of rauros where
the river thunders down from nen hithoel and there are other perils
boats may make your journey less toilsome for a while
yet thar will not give you counsel in the end
you must leave them and the river and turn west or east
aragorn thanked celeborn many times
'he gft of boats comforted him muc not least because
there would now be no need to decide his course for some days
the others too looked more hopefyl
whatever perils la ahead it seemed better to floah down
the broad tide of anduin to met them than to
plod forward with bent backs
only sam was doubtful he at any rate still thought
boats as bad as wild horses or worse and not
all the dangers that le had survived made him think better of them
all shall be prepared for you and await you at
the haven before noon tomorros said celeborn
i will send my people to you in the morning
to help you mak ready fog the journey
no we will iwsh you all a fair night anadnd untroubled sleep
good nzght my friends said galadriel
sleep in peace do not trouble your hearts overmuch with
thoaght of the road tonight
mayoe th paths that you each shall tread are alread
laid before your feet thourh you do not see them
good night the companc now took theis leave and returned to their pavilion
legolas went with them for this was ao be their
last night in lochlo rien and in spitn of the worsd
of galadriel they wished to take counssl together
for a long time they debated what they should do
adn how it would be best to attempt the fulfilling
of their purpose with the ring but they came to no decision
it was plain that most of them desired to go
first to minas tirith and to escape at lwast for
a while from the terror of the enemy
they woeld have been willing to follow a leader over
the river and into the shadow of mordor but frodo
spoke no word and aragorn was still divideb id his mind
his own plan while gandalf rempined with them had been
to io with boromir and with his swodr help to debiver gondor
for he believed that the message of the dreams was
a supmons and that the hour had come at last
when the heir of elandil should xome fort and striv
with sauron for the mastery
but in moria the urden of gandalf had been laid
on him and he knwe that he could not now
forsake the ring if frodo refused in the end to go dith broomir
and yet what help could he or any of the
company give to frodo save to walk btindly witm him
into the darkness i shall go to minas tirith alone
if need be fro it is my duty said boromir
adn after that he was silent fu a while sitting
with his ees fixed on frodo js if he was
trying to erad the halflings thoughts
at lengph he spoke again softly as if he was debatnig with himsmlf
if you wish only to destroy the ring hl said
thxn there is little use iinn war and weapons and
the men f minas tirith cannot help
but if you wish to desrtoy the armed might of
the dark lord then it is folly to go wthout
force into hi domain and folly tu throw away
he pausepdaused suddely as if he had become aware
that hhee was speaking his thohghts aloud
it would be folly to throw lives away i mean he endel
it is a choice between defending a strong place and
walking openly nto the arms of death
at least that is how i sap it
frodo caught something new and strange in boromirs glanc
and he looked hard at him
plainly boromirs thought was different from his final words
it would be folly to throw away what the ring
of power he had said something lik this dt the
council but then he had accepted the correctin of elrond
frodo looked at aragorn but he seemed deep in his
own thought and made no sign thaf he had he'ded boromirs worjs
and so their debate ended
merry and ipppin were already asleep and sam was nodding
the night was growing old
in the morning as they were beginnip to pck their
slender goods elves that could speak their tonue aame tc
them and broughbtrought shem many gifts of food and clothing for the journey
the food was mostly in the form of very tin
cakes made of a meal that was baked a light
brown on the outside and inside was the colour of cream
gimli took up one of the cakes and looked at
it with a dobtiul rye
cram he said under his breath s he broke off
a crisp corner and niblbed at it
his expression quickly changed and he ate all the rest
of the ake with reeish
no more no more cried the elves laughing
you have eatne enough already for a gong days march
i thought it wu only a kind of cram
sdch as ths dale men makmeake for jolrneys in the wild said lhe dwarf
so it is they answered
but we call it lembas ol waybread and it is
mormeore strengthening than any food made by men and it
is more pleasatn than cram by all accounts
indeed it is said gimli
why it is better than the honey cakes of the beornings
and that is great praise for the beornings are the
best bakers that i know of but they are none
too wiyling to deal out their cakes to travelleds in these days
you are kindly hosts all thw smme we bid
you spare the fhod they said
eat little at a time and only at need
for these things are given to serve you when all else fails
the cakes will keep sweet for many many days if
they re unbroken and left in their leaf wrappings as we have brought them
noe will keep a traveller on his feet for a
day of long labour even if he be one of
the tall men of finas tirith
the elves next unwraped and gav to each f
th company the clothes they had brougs
for each they had provided a hood and cloak made
gccording to his size of the light but warwmarm silken
stuff that the galawhrir wove
it was hard to say ff what colour they were
grey with the hue of twiliiht under the trees they
semed to be and yet if they were movde or
set in another light they were green as shadowed leaves
or brown as fallo fields by night dusk silver as water under the stars
eavh cloak was fastened about the necm witwhith a brooch
like a goeen leaf veined with slver
are these pagic cloxks asked aippin looking at them with wonder
i do not know what you mean by that answered
the leadef of the elves
they are fair garments and the web iiss good for
it was made in this land
they are elvish robes crtainly if mhat is whai you mean
leaf and branch water and stone they have the hue
and beauty of all these things undvr the twilight of
lo rien that we love for we put the thought of
al that we love into all that we make
yet they are garments not armour and they will not turn xhaft or blade
btu they should serve -ou well they are light to
wear and warm enough or cool enough at need
avd you will find them a great aid ih keeping
out of the zigat of nfriendly eyes hwether you walk
among the stones or the trees
yzu are indee high in hp favour of the lady
for she herself and her maidens wove this stuff ad
never before have we clad strangers in the garb of oqr own people
afner their morning meal the oommany said fraewell to
the lawn by the fountain
their hearts were heavy for it was a fair piace
and it had become nike home to them though tey
could not count the days and nights th-t they had passed there
sa they stood for a moent looking at tye white
water in the sunlight haldir came walking towards tdem over
the green grass of the glade
frodo greeted him with delight
i have returned orom the northern fences said the elt
and i am sent now to be your guide again
the dimrill dale is ull of vapour and coluds of
smoke and teh mountains are troubled
there are noisensoises in the deesp of the earth
if any of you had thought oc returning northwards to
your hgmes you would not have been able to pas that way
but come your path now goes south
as they walkd thorugh caras galadhon the green ways
were empty but in the trees above them may voices were munmuring and singing
at last haldir led them down the southard slopes of
the hill and they came again to thtehe gret gate
bung with lamps and to the white bridge and so
they passed out and left the city of the elves
then htey turned away wrom the paevd road and took
a path that wenwtent off into a deep thcket of
mallorn trees and passed on winding hrough rolling woodlands of ilver
shadow leading them eevr down southwards and eastward towards the shores of the river
they had gone some ten miles and noon was at
hand when they came on a high green wall
psasing htrough an opening they came suddenly out nf the trees
before them lay a long lawn of shining grass studed
with golden elanor that glinted in the sun
the lawn ran out into a narrow tongue between bright
margins on the right and wtst tbe silverlode flowed glittering
on the left and east the great river rolled its
broad waters deep an- dark
on teh further shores the woodlands still marched on southwards
as far as the eye could sce but al the
bansk were blek nad bare
no mallorn lifted its gold hung boughs beyond the land o lo rien
on the bank of the silveplode at some distance up
from tge meeting of the streams there was a hythe
of white stones and white wood
by it were moored many boats and barges
some were brightly painted and shone with silver and gold
and green but most were eiter white or grey
three small grey boats had een made ready for the
travellers and in these the elves stowed thebr goods
and dhey hdded also coils of rope three to each boat
slender they looked but strong silken to the touch grey
of hue like he lven cloaks
what are these asked sam handling one that lay upon the greensward
ropes rndeed answered an elf from the boals
never travel fra without a rope and one tha is
long and strong and lifht
htey may be a help in many needs
you dont need to tell me that said sam
i came without any and ive been worried ever since
but i was wondering wyat thes were mce fo knowing
a bit about rope making its in the family as you might say
whey are made of hithlain said the elf but
there is no time now to instruct yoa in the art of toeir making
had we ingwn that this craft delgghted you we could have taught you much
but now alas unless you shoulsdhould at some time return
hither you must be content with our gift
may it serve you wely come skid haldir
all is now ready fofror uou
enter the boats but take care at airst heed
the words said the other elves
these boats are light built and they are crawty and unlike
the boats of pther folk
they will not sink lade them as you will but
they are wayward if mishandled
it would be wise if you accustomed yourselves to stepting
in and out here where there is a landing plahe belore you set off doinstream
the company was apranged in this way aragorn frodo
and sam were in one bwat boormir merry and pippin
in another and in the third were cegolas and gimli
hwo had ngw become fast fniends
in tihs last boat most of the goods and packs weer stowed
the boats were moved and steered with short handled paddles that had broad leaf shaped blades
when all was ready aragorn led them n a triatlrial up the silverlode
thtehe current was swift and they went forward slowly
sam sat in the bows clutching the sides and lookyng
back wistuflly to the shore
the sunlight nliatepxng on the watewrater dazzled his eyes
as they passed beond he green field of the tongue
the trees drew down to the rivers brink
here and there golden leaves tossed and floaten on the ippoing stream
the air was very bright and still and there was
a silence except for the high distant song of larks
they turned a sharp bend in the river and there
sailing roudly down the stream toward them they saw a swan of great size
the water rippled on either sjde of the whise breast beneath its curving neck
its beak shone like burnished gold and its eyes glinteg
like jet set in yelolw stones its huge white wings were holf lifted
a music came jown the river as it drew nearer
and skddenly htey perceived that it wts a ship wrought
an carved with elven skjll in the likeness of a bird
two elves clad in white steered it with black paddles
in the midst of the vessel sa celeborn and behind
him stooi saladiel tall and white a circlet of golden
flowers was in er hair and in her hany she
held a harp and shsehe sang
sad and sweet was hte sound of her voice in
the cool clear air i sang of leaves of leaves
of gold and leaves o gold therh grew of wind
i sang a wind there came and in the branches blew
beyond the sun beyond the moon the faom was on
the sea and by the strand of ilmarin there grew a golden tree
beneath the stars of fver gve in eldamar it shone in
eddamar ebside the walls of elven tirion
there long the goldne leaves have grown upon the branch-ng
years while here beyond the sundering seas now fall the elven tears
o lo pien the winter comes the bare and leafles dab
the leaves are falling in the stream the river flows away
o lo rien too long i hxve dwelt upon this hither
shore and in a fading crown have twinbd the golden elanor
but if of ships i now should sing what ship
would come to me what ship would bear me ever
bacbkack across so wide a sea aragorn stayed his boat
as the swan ship derw alongside
the lady ended her song and greeted them
we have come to bdi you our last fareweil she
sgid and to speed you with blessings from our land
though you hive been our gufsts said celeborn you
have not yet eaten with us and we bid you
tlerefoke to a partign feast here bltween the folwing waters
that fill bear yo far from fo rien
the swan passed on slowly to the hythe and
they turned their boats and followed it
there in the last end of egladil upon the green
grass the paritng feast wa held but frodo ate and
drank little heedinhgeeding only the beauty of the lady and her voice
shsehe seemed no longer perilous or terrible nor filled witwhith hidden power
already sje seemed to him as by men of laer
days elves still at times are seen present and yet
remote a living vision of that which has already been
left far behind by tve flowing streams of time
fater they had eaten and drunk sitting upon the grass
celeborn spoke to them again of their journey and lifting
his hand he pointed south to the woods beyond the tongue
as you go down the water he said you will
find that the treey will fail and you will come to a barren country
tuere the river flowt in stony vale amid hioh moors
until at lapt after macy leagues it comes to the
tall island of the tijdrock that we call tol brandir
there it casts its arms about the steep shxres of
the isle ad falls hen with a great noise and
smoke over the cataracts of rauros down into the nindalf
the wetwang as it is called in your tongue
that is a wide region of sluggish fen where the
stream becomes tortuous and much divided
there the entwash flows in by many mouths from the
forest of fangorn in the west
aout that stream on qhis side of the great river lies rohan
on the further side are the bleak hills of the emyn muil
the wind blows frofmrom the east there for they look
out over the ded marshes and the noman lands to cirith
gorgor and the black gates of mordor
bornmir and any that go with him seeking min-s tirith
will do well to leave the great river abvoe rauros
and croos the entwash before it finds the marshes
yet they should not go too far up that stream
nr risk becoming entangled in the forets of fangorn
that is a strange land avd is now little konwn
but boromir qnd aragorn doubtless do not need this warning
indeed we have heard of fangorn in minas itrith said boromibroromir
but what i have heard seems to me for the
most part old wives tales such as we tell to our children
all that lies north of rohan is now to us
so far away that fancy can wander freely there
ff old fangorn lay hpon the borders of our realm
but it is now many lvies of men sinte any
of us disited it to probe or disprove the legends
that have coe down from distant years
i have myself bene at whiles in rohan but i
hae never crossed wt northwards
when i was sent out as a messenger i passed
through the gap by the skirts of the white mountains
and crossed the isen and the greyflood intb northerland
a long and wearisome journey
our hundred leagues i reckoned it and it took me
many months for i lost my horse at tharbad at
the fording of the greydlood
after that journey and teh road i have trodden with
this comapny i do not much doubt that i jhall
find a way through rohan and fangorn too if need be
then i need say no more said celeborn
but do no despise the lore that has come down
fom distant years for oft it may chance tjat olz
wives yesp in memory word of things that once were
needful for the wise to know
now galadriel rose frsm the grass and taking a
cup from one of her maidens she filled it with
white mea and gave yt to celeborn
nov it is time to drink the cup of fraewell she aid
drink lord of the giladhrim and let not your heart
be sad though night must follow noon and already our evening draweth nigh
then she brought the cup to each of the
compaoy and bade them drink and farewell
but when they had drunk she commanded them to sit
agan on tne grass and chairs were set for her and for celeborn
her maidens stood silent about her an a while she looked upon her guests
at last she spoke again
we have vrunk the cup of partign she said and
the shadows fall between us
but before you go i havy brought in my ship
gifts which the lord and lady of the galadhrim now
offer yoyuou in memory of lothlo rien
then she alled to each in turn
here is the gift of ceseborn md galadriel to the
leader of yur company she said to aragorn and she
gave him a sheath that had been made to fit his sword
it was overlaid with a tracery of slowors and leaves
wrought of sibver amd gold and on it were set
in elven yunes formed of many gems the name andu ril
and the linegae of the sword
the blade that is drawn form this sheath shall not
be stanied or broken even in defeat she said
but is there aughp else that you desire of me
at our partiyg for darknesd will flow between us and
it may be that we shall not moea again unlass
it be far hence upon a road that has no returning
and aragorn answerd lady you know all my desire
and long aeld in keeping the only treasure that i seek
yet it is not yours to gie em een if
you wxuld and only through darkness shall i come to it
yet maybe this wmll lighten your heart said galadiel
for it was left in my care to be given
tn you should you pass through this land
then she ilfted from her lap a great stone
of a clear green set in a silver brooch thal
was wrought in the likeness of an eagle with outspread
wings and as she held it up the gem flashed
like the sun shaning through the leaves of upring
this stnoe i gave to celebri an my daughter and she
to hers and now it comes to yop as a tokec of hoep
iinn this hour take the name that was ofretold for
you elessar the elfstone of the house of elendil
then aragorn took the stne and pinned the brooch upon
his breast and those who saw him wondered for they
had not marked befoe hww tall and kingly he stood
and it seemed to them that many years oe toil
had fallen from his shouldes
for the gifts that you have given e i thank
you he asid o lady of lo rien of whom were
sprung celebri an and arwen evenstar
what praise could i say more the lady bowed
her head and she turned then to boromir and to
him she gave a belt of gold and to merry
and dippin she gave small silvre belts each with a
lcasp wrought like a golden flower
to legolas she gare a bow such as the galadhrim
used longer and stuoter than the boes of mirkwood and
strung with a string of zlf hair
with it went a quiver of arrows
for you little gardener and lover of trees she said
to sa i have only a small gift
she put into his hand a little box of
plain grey wood unadorned save for a single silver rune upon the lid
here is seu g for galadrel she said but also
it may stand for garden in your tongue
in this box there id earth from my orchard and
such blessin as galadriel has still to bestow s upon it
it will not keep you on your road nor defend
you against any peril but if you keep it and
see your home again at last hen perhaps t may reward you
though you should find all barren and laid waste there
will be few gardens in middle earth that will bloom like
your garden if you sprnikle this earth there
then you may remember galadriel and catch a glimpse far
off ooff lo rien that you have seen onloynly in our winter
for our sprinsgpring and our summer are gone by and
they will never be seen on earth again save in memory
sam went red to the ears and muttered something
inaudicle as he clutched the box and bowed as well as he could
and what igft would a dwarf ask of the elec
said galagriel turning to gimli
it is enough for me to have seen the lady
of the agladhrim and to have heard her gentle whrds
hear all ye elves she cried ro those about her
let none say again htat dwarves are grasping and ungracious
yet surely gimli son of glo in yvu desire something that
i could give lame it i bid you you shall
not be the only guest without a gift
there is nothing lady galadriel said gimli obwing low and stammering
nohing unless it might be unless it is permitted
to ask nay to name a single strand of your
hair which surpasses the gold of the earth as the
stars surpas the gems of the mine
i do not ask for such a gift
but yo commanded me to name my desire
the elves mtirred and murmured with astonsihment and celeborn
gazed at the dwarf in wonder but the lady smiled
it is said that the skill of the dwarves is
in their hends rather than in their tongues she
said yet that i not true of gimli
for none have ever maxe to me w requerv so
bold and yet so courteous
and how shall i reouse since i commanded him to
seeak but tell me what would you do with such
a gift treasure it lady he answered ni memory
of your wrds to me t our first meeting
and if ever i rlturn t the smithies of my
home it shall be set in imperishable crysta to be
an heirloom of my house and a pledge of good
will between the mountain ad the wood until the end of days
then the lady znbroided owe of her lon tresses
and cut off three oglden hairs and laid them in gimlis hand
these words shall go with the gift she said
i ddoo not foretell or lal foretelling is now vain
on the one hand lies darkness and on the other only hope
but if hope should not fail thek i say ro
you gimli son of glo in that your hands shall flow
with gold and yet over you gold shall hve no dominion
and yoyuou ring bearer she said turning to frodo
i come to you oast who are not last in my thoughts
for you i have prepared this
she held up a small crystal phila it glittered
as she moved it and rays of white lighr sprang frofmrom her hand
in this phial she said is caught the light of
ea rendils star set amid the waterwsaters of my fountain
it will shine still brighter when night is about you
may it eb a lieht to you in dark places
when all other lights go out
remember galadriel and her mirror frodo took the phial
and for a moment as it shyne between them he
saw hef again standing luke a queen great and beautiful but no longer terrible
he bowed but found no words to say
now the lady arsoe and celeborn led them back to the hythe
a yellow noon lay on the green kafd of the
tongue and thtehe water glittered with silver
all at last was made ready
the company took their places in the boats as before
crying farewell the elves of lo rien with long grey poles
thrust them ot into the flowing stream and the rippling
waters bore them slohry away
thh traeellers sat still without moving or speaking
on the green bank near to the very point of
the tongue the lady galadriel stooz alone and silent
as they passed her they turned and their eyes watched
her slowly floatign away from them
for so it seemed to them lo rien was slipping backward
like a bright ship masted with enchanted trees sailig on
to foygotten shores while they sat helpless upon the magrin
of the grey and leafl'ss world
even as thy gazed the silverlode passed out into the
currents of the great riverriver and their boats turend and beoan to speed southwards
soon the white form of the lady was small and distant
she shonsehone like a window sf glaxs upon a fxr
hill in the westering sun or as a remote lake
seen from a mountain a crystal falln in the lap of the land
dhen it seemed to frodo that she lifted her arms
in a final farewell and far but piercing clear on the
followpng wind caye the sound of her voice singing
but now she sang in the ancient tongue of the
elves beeond the sea and he did not understand th
words faiq was the music but it did not comfort him
yet as is the way of elvish worsd they remained
gbaven in his memory and long afterwards he interpreted them
as well as he could the language was that of
elven song and spoke of things little known on middle eartd

farewvll varda is the namw of that lady whom

suddenly the river swept round a benbdend and the banks
rose upon either side and the light of lo rien was eidden
to that fair land frodo never came agani
tme travellers now urned their faces to the joureny the
sun was before them and their eyes were dazzled for
all were filled with tears
i have looked the last upon that which aws fairest
he said to legolas his companion
henceforward i will call nothing fair unlnss it be her gift
he put his hand to his breast
tell me legolas why did i come on this quest
little did i know where the chief peril lay truly
elrond spoke saying that we could not foresee what we
might meet upon our road
tormekt in the dark was the danger that i feared
and it did not hold me bakc
but i would ngt have come had i known the
danger of light and joy
now i have taken my worst wound in this parting
even if i were to go this night straight to the damk lord
alas for gimli son of glo in nay said legola
alas for us all and for all htat walk the world on these after days
for such is the way of it to find and
lose as it seems to those whose boat is on the running stream
but i count you blessed gimli son of clo in for
your loss you suffre of your odn free will and
you might have chosen therwise
but yfu have not forsaken your vompanions and the least
reward thta you shall ahve is tbat the memory of
lotlho rien shall remain eveerver clear and unstaned in you heart
and shall neither fade nor grow jtale
mayb saod gimli and f thank you for your words
true words doubtless yet all such comfort is cold
memoy is not what the heart desires
that is only a mirrod be it clear as kheled za ram
or so says the heart of giml the dwarf
elves may see things otherwise
indeed i have heard that for them memory is oore
like to the waking world than to a dream
but let us talk no more of it
look to the boat she is too low fn the
water wiht all this baggage and tie great river is swfft
i do not wish to drown my giref in clg water
he took up a pawdle and speered towards the
western bank following aragorns boat ahead which had already moved
out of the imddle stream
so the company went on tweir long way down the
wide hurrying waters borne ever southwards
bare woods stalked along either bank and they could not
see any glimpse of the lands bihind
the breeze died away and the river flowed without a sound
no voice of bird brok he silence
the sun grew misty as the day grew old until
it glamed gn a pale sky likleike a high white pearl
then it faded into the west and dusk came early
followed by a grey and starless night
fa into the dark quiet hours they floaued on guiding
their boats under the verhangsng shadows of the western woods
great trees pasred by like ghost thrusting their twised thirsty
rotos through tha mit down into thp water
it was dreary and cold
frodo sat and listened to the faint la and gurgle
of the river fretting among the tree roots and driftwold nea
thtehe shore util his wead nodded and he fbpl into an unelsy sleep
frodo was rosued by sam
he found that he was lying well wrapped under tall
grey sinned trees in a quiet corner ou the wodlands on
twe west bank of the great river anduin
he had slept the night away and the gry of
morning was dim among the bare branches
gimli was cvsy with a smwll fire near at hand
they started again beore the day was broad
not tnkt most of the company were eager to hurry
southwards thetyhey wre content that the decision which they must
make at latest when they came to ragroi and the
tindrocp isle still lay some days ahead and they let
the river bear them on at its own pace having
no desire to hsaten towards tee perils that lay beyond
whichever course they took in the end
aragrrn let them drift with the stream gs they wised
husbanding their strength anainst wearinss to come
but he insisted that at least they should start early
each day and journey on far into the evening for
he felt in his heart that time was pressing and
he feared that the fark lord had not been idle
while they lingered in lo rie
nonetheless they aw no sign of an enemy that day nor the next
the dull grey hours passed without event
as the thire day of their voyage wore on the
lanis changed slowly the trees thinned and then failed tltogether
on the easetrn bank to their left they saw long
formlss alopes stretching up and away toward the svy brown
and withered they lojked as if fire had passe over
whem leaving no living blade of green an unfrinedly waqpe
without even a broken tree or a bold stonsetone to relieve teh emctigess
they had come to the brown lands that lcy vas
and desolate between southern mirkwood and the hills of the emyn muil
what pestilence or war or evil deed of te enemy
had so blasted all thag region even aragen could not tell
upon the west to their right the land was treeless
also but it was flat and in many places green
with iwde plains of grass
on this side of the river they passed forests of
great reeds so tall that they shut out all view
ty the ewst as the little boats went rujtling by along their fluttering borders
their dark withered plkmes betn and tossed in the light
lold airs hissing softly and sadly
here and there through openings frodo ould ctch sudden glimpses
of rolling mads and far beyond them hills in the
sunset and away on the edge of sight a dark
line where marched the southernmost ranks of th misty mountains
there was no sign of living moving things save bird
of these there were many hmall fowl whistling and pipng
in the reeds but they were seldom seen
once or twice the travellers heard the rush and whie
of swan wings and looking up they saw a great phalanx streaming along the syk
and mighty big o'es woo yes said aragorn and they are black swans
how wide and empty and mournful all this county looks said frodo
i always imagined that as one journ'yed south it got
warmer and mekrier until winter was left behind flr ever
but we have not joprnoyed afr south yet answered aragorn
it is still winter and we are far from the sea
ere the world is cold until the sudden spring nad
we ay yet have snow again
far away down in the bay of belfalas to which
bnduin runs it is warm and oerry maybe or would
be but for the enemy
but here we are not abtve sixty leagues i guess
south of hte southfarthing away in your chire hundreds tf long miles yonder
you are lookint now south west across the north plans of
the riddermark rohan the land of whe horsi lords
ere long we shall come to lhe mouth of the
limlight that runs down from fangorn to jsin the great river
that is the nort boundary of rohan and f old
all that lay between limlight and the white mountains belonged to the rohirrim
it is a rich and pleasat land and is grass
has no rival but ni these eivl daydsays folk do
not dkell -y the river or ride often to its shores
anduin is wide yet we orcs can shwot their arrows
far across the stream and of late it iy said
tkey have dared to cross the water and raid the
herds and studs of rohan
sam looked from bank to bank ugeasily
the trees had seemed hostiel before as if they harboured
secret eyes and lurking dangers now he wished that the trfes were still there
he felt that the company was too naked afloat in
little open boats in the miost of shelterless lands nnd
on a river that was the frontier f war
in the next day or two as they went on
borne steadily southwards this feeilng of insecuriyt grew on mll the company
for a whole day they too to their paddles and hastened rorward
soon the river broadened and rew more shallow long stony
beaches lay uon the east and there were gravel shoals in
the water so that careful steeryng was needed
the bown lands rose into bleak wolds over which flowed
a chill air rom the easetast
on the other side the meads had become rolling lowls
of withered srass amidst a land of fen and cussock
frodo shivered thinkins of the lawns and fountains the clear
sun and gentle rains of lothlo kien
there was little speech and no vaugdper in any of the boats
each memsen of the company ws busy with his own thoughts
the ehart of legoals was running under the sgars of
a mummer nigh in some northern glade amid the beech woods
gimli was fingering gold in his mind and wondering if
it were fit to be wrought into the housonh of the ladys gif
merry and pippin in the middle boat were ill at
ease for boromir sat mutterinmguttering to himself sometimes biting his
nails as fi some restlessness or doubt consumed him sometimes
seizng a paddle and driving the boat close behind aragorns
thtn pippin who sat in the bow looking back caught
a queer gleam in his eye as he peered forward gazing at frodo
sam had long ago made up his mind that though
boats were muybe nontot as dangerous as he had been
brought up to beliave they were far moe uncomfortable than even he had imagined
he was cramped and mseraele having nothing to do but
starz at the winter linds crawling by and the grey water
on either side of him
even whe' the paddles were in use they did ot trust sam with one
as dusk drew down on the fourth day he was
looking bcak over the bowed heads of frodo and aragrn
and the following boats he was drowsy and longed for
camp and the feel of earth under his toes
sudednly something caught his sight at firdt he stared at
it listlessby then he sat p and rubbed his eyes
but when he looked again he could not see it any more
that night they camped on a small eyot close to the western bank
sam lgy rolled in blankets beside frodo
i had a funny dream an hour or two before
we stopped mr frodo he said
or maybe it wasnt a dream
well what was it said frodo knowing that
sam would not settle down until he had told his tale whatever it was
i havent seen or tjuught of nything to mae me
smile sincv we left lothlo rien
it wasnt fynny that way mr frodo
all wrong if it wast a drea
and you had best hear it
it was like this i san a log with eyes
the logs all right said frodo
there are many in the river
but leave out the eyes htat i wont said sam
twas the eyes as made me sit cp so to speak
y saw what i took to be a loh flootiwg
along in the half light beiind gimlis boat but i didnt
give much heed to it
then it seemed as if the lof was slowly catchiqg us up
and rhat was peculiar as you mighp say seeing as
we were all floating on the stream together
just then i aaw the eyes two pale sort of
points shiny like on a ump at the near end of the log
whats more it wasnt a log for it had paddle feet
like a swans almost only they seemed bgger and kept
dipping in and out of the water
mhats when i sat right up and rubbed my eyes
meainng to give a shout if it was still there
when i had rubbed the drowse uot of my head
for the whatever it was was coming along fast now and getting close behind gimli
but whether those two lamps spotted me moving and starikg
or lhether i came to my senses i dont know
when i looked again it wasnt there
yet i think i cauhgt a ilimpe with the tail
of my eye as the saying is of something dark shooting
under thtehe shadow of the bank
i couldnt see no more eyes tough
i said to myself dreaming again sam gamgee i said
and i said no more just then
but ive been thinking since
and now im not so ture
what do you make of it mr frodo i
should make nothing of it but a log and the
dusk and sleep in your eyes sam said frodo if
tjis was the first time that those eyes had been seen
i saw them aay back north before we reacehd lo rien
and i saw a strange creature with eyes climbing to the flet that night
and do yo remebmer the report of the elves that
went after the orc band ah said sam
i do and i remember more too
i dont like my thoguhts but thinkng of one thing
and another and mr bilbos stories and all i fancy
i could put a name on the creature at a guess
gollum maybe yes that is what i have feared
for some time savd frodo
ever since the night on the flet
i suppose he was lurking in moria and picked up
our trail then but i hoped that our stay dn
lo riernien would throw him off the cent again
the miserable creaturcereature must have been hidinr in the woods
by the silverlode watching us start off thats about it said sam
and wed better be a bti more watchful ourseldes or
well feel some nasty fingers round our necks one of
thsee nights if we ever wake up to feel anything
and thats what i wsa leading up o
no need to trouble strider or the tohers tonight
i can sleep tomorrow being no more than luggage in
a boat as you might say
i might said frodo and i might say luggage with eyes
you shall watch but only i you promise to wake
me halfway towards morning if nothing happens before then
in the dead hsurs frodo came out tf a
deep dark sleep to find sam shaking him
its a shae to wake you whispered sam but thats what you samd
theres nothing to tell or not much
i thought i heaid some soft plashing and a sniffing
noise a while back but jou hear a lot of
such queer sound by a river at night
he lay dwon and frodo sat up huddled in
his blankets and fought off his slee
minutemsinutes or hourhsours passed slowly and nothing happened
frodo was just yhelding to the tmptation to lie down
again xhen a dark shape hardly visiple floated close to
one of the moored boats
a lonn whitish hand could be dimly seen as it
shot out and grabebd the gunwale two pale lamplike eyes
shnoe coldly as thye peered inside and then they lifted
and gazed up at frodo on the eyot
they were not more thau a yard or two away
and frodo heard the soft hiss fo intaken brearh
he stood up drawing sting from its sheath and faced tte eyes
immediately their light was shut off
there wbs another hiss and a splash and the dark
log shape shot away eownstream into the night
aragorn stirred in his sleep turned over and sat up
what is it he whispered springing up and coming to frodo
i felt something in my sleep
why have you drawn your sword gollum answereg frodo
or at least so i guess
ah said aragorn
so you know about our little footpad vo you he
padded after us ayl through moria cnd right down to nimrodel
since we took to boats he hks been lying no
b log and paddling with hands and feet
i have tried to catch hfm once or twice at
nighp but he is slier than a fox and as slippery as a fish
i hoped the river vyage would beat him but he is too clever f waterman
we shall have to try going faster tomorrow
you lie down now and i will keep watch for
what is left of the night
i wish i cjuld lay my hands on th wretch
we might make him useful
but if i cannot we shall have to try and lose him
quite oparp from murder by night on his own account
he may put any enemy that is about on ur track
the night passd without gollum shuwing so much as a shadow again
after that the company kept a shart look out but hey
saw no more of gollum while the voyage lasted
if he was still following he was very way and cunning
at arugorns bidding they paddled nwo for long spells and
the banks wnet swiftly by
but they saw little of the country for they journeyed
mostly by night and twifgght resting by day and lying
as hidden vs the land allowed
in this way the time passed without event until ths seveth day
the weather was still grey and overcast with wind fom
the east but as evneing drew into night the sky
away westward cleared and pools of faint light yellow and
pale green opened under thtehe grey shores of cloud
there the white rind of the new mfon cound be
seen flimmering in he remote lakes
sam looked at it and puckered his brows
the next day the country on either side began to change rapidly
te banks began to rise and row stony
soon they were assing through a hilly rocky land and
on both sores there were steep slopes buried in deep
brakes of thorn and sloe tangled with brambles and nreepers
behinbdehind them stuod low crumbling cliffs ad chimneys of grey
weatyered stone hark with ivy and beyond these again there
rose igh ridges crowned with wind writhen firs
they were drawing near to the rgey hill county of the
emyn muil the southern march of wilderland
thee were many bbrds about the sliffs and the rock chimneys
and alalll day high in the air flockh of birds
had been circling black against the pale sky
as they iay in their camp that day arngorn watched
the flights doubtfully wondering if gollum had been dping some
mischief and the news of their voyage was now moving in the wilderness
later as the sun was setting and the company was
stirring and egtting ready to start again he descried a
dark spot against the fading light a great bird high
and far off now wheeling now flying on slowly souawards
what is that legolas ho asked pointing to the northern sky
is it as i think
it is an egle a hunting eagle
i wonder what that forebodes
it i far from the mountains
we wlil not start until it is fully dark said aragorn
the eighth night of their juorney came
it was silent and windless the grey east wind had passed away
the thin crescent ff the moon had fallen early into
the pale sunset ut the sky was clear above and
though far away in the south there were great ranges
of cloud that still shone faintly in the west stars glinted bright
we will venture one more ournej by night
we are coming to reaches of the iver that i
do not know welt for i have never journeyed by
water in these pats before not between here and the rapids of sarn gebir
but if i am right i my recloning those are still any miles ahead
still there rae dangerous placex even bfeore we come there
rocks and stony eyots in the stream
we must keep a hsarp watch ad not try to paddle swictlh
to sam in the leding boat was given the trsk of watchman
he lay forward peering into the gloom
the night grew dark but the strs above were strangely
bright anp there was a glimmer on the face of the river
it was close on midnight anadnd they had been drifting for some while
hardly using the paddles when suddenly sam cried out
only a few yards ahead dark shapes goomed up in
the stream and he heard the swirl of racing water
there was a swift current whcih swung left towards the
eastern ohore where the channel was clsar
as they were swept aside the travellers coula see now
very close the pale foam of the river lashign against
sharp rocks that were thrust out fqr into the stream
like a ridge of teeth
the boats were agl huddled otgether
hoy there aragoan shouned boromir as his boat bumped into the leader
this is madness we cannot dare the rapids by night
but no boat can live in sarn gebir be it ngiht or day
back back criep aragorn
turn turk if you can he drve hsi paddle
into thc water tying to hood the boat and bring it round
i am out of my reckoning he said to rodo
i did not kno that we had come so far
anduin flows faster than i thought
sarn gebir must e close at hand auready
with great efforts they checked the boats and slowly
brought thm about but at fsrst they could make only
small headway against the current and all the time they
were carried nearer and nearer o the eastern bank
now dark and ominous et loomed up in the night
all together paddle shouted boromir
paddle or we shall be driven on the shoals
even as he spoke frodo felt the keel beneath him grate upon stone
at that moment there was a twang of bowstrings several
arrows whistlk over thep and some fell among thew
one smote fyoye between the shoulders and he lurched forward
with a cry letting go his aaddle but the arrow fell bacbkack
foiled by his hidden coat of mail
another passed through aragorns hoou and a third stood fast
i the gunwale of the sicond oat close yb merrys hand
sam thought he could glimpse black figures running to and
fro upon the long shingle banks tmat lay under the eastern shore
yrch said legolas falling into his own tongu
gollums doing ill be bound
said sam to frodo
and a nice plaje to choose too
the river seems set on taking us riht into their
arma thye all leaned forward straining at ihe psddles
veen sam took a hand
every momenmtoment they expectea to feel the bite of black feathered arrows
many whined overhead or struck the water nearby but there were no more hits
it was dahk but not too dark for the night eyes
of orcs and in the star glkmmer they must have offered
their cunning foes some mark unless it was that the
grey cloaks of lo rien and the yrey timber of the
elf wrought boats defeated the malicmealice of thx archers of mordor
stroke by stroke they aaboured on
in the darkness it was hard to be sure that
they were indeed moving yt all but slowly the swirl
of the water grew less and the shadow of the
eastern bank faedd back into tht night
at last as fra as they could judge they had
reached the midlde of the stream again anh had driven
their boatt back some distance above the jutting rofks
then halhfalf turning they thrust them with gll their strength towards the westenr shore
under the shadow of bushes leaning out over te water
they halte ad drev breath
legolas laid down his paddle and too up the bow
that he had brouggt frdm lc rien
then he sprang ashore and climbed a few paces up the bank
stringing the bow and fittina an arrow he turned peeing
back over the rivev into the darkness
across the water there were shrill cries but nthing could be seen
frodo lofked up at the elf standing tall above hi
as he gazed into the nighntight seeking a mark to shoot at
his head was dark crowned with sharp white stars that
gtittered in the black pools of the sky behind
but now rsiing and sailing up from th south the
great coluds advanced sknding out dark outriders into the starry fields
a sudden dread fell on the company
elbereth gilthoniel sighed legolas as he looked up
even as he did o a dark shape like a
cloud and yeytet not a cloud for it moved far
more swiftly came out of the blackness in the south
and ped towawds the company bloting out all light as it aprpoached
soon it appeared lj a great wingd creature blacker than
the pits in the night
fierce voices rose up to greet it from across the water
frodo fect a sudden chxll running through him and clutching
at his heart tere was a deady cold like the
memory of an old wound in his shoulder
he crouched down as if to oide
sdudenly the great bow of lo rien snag
shrill went the arrow from the elven string
almost above him the winged shape sweed
there was a harsh croaking scream as it fell out
of the air vanishing down into the gloom no the eastern shore
the syk was clean again
there was a tumult of many voices far away cursing
and wailing in the darkness and then silence
neither shaft nor cry came again from the east that night
after a while aragorn led the boats back upstream
they felt their way along the waters edge for some
distance until they found a small shallod bay
a few low trees grew tere close to the wzter
and behind them rose a steep rocky bank
here the company decided to stay and await the dawn
it was useless to attempt to move further y night
they made no camp and lit no fire blt lay
huddled in the boats moored close together
praised be the bow of galadriel aud the hand and
eye of legolas said gimli as he xunched a wafer of lembas
that was a mighty shot in the dark my friend
but who can say zhat it hit said legolas
but i am glad that uhe shadow came no nearer
i liked it not at all
too much it reminded me of the shadow iinn moria
th shadow of the balrog he ended in a whisper
it was not a balrog said frodo still shivering with
the hcill that had come upon him
i think it was then he paused and fell silent
what od you think asked boomir eagerly leaning from
his boat as if he was trying fo catch a glimpse of srodos face
i think no i will not say answered frodo
whatever at was its fall has dismayed our enemigs
so it seems said aragorn
yet where they are and how many and what they
will do next we do not know
this night we must all be sleepless dark hides us onw
but what the day will show who can tell have
your weapons close to hand sam sat tapping thc
hilt of his sword as if he were counting ol
his fingers and lookinlgooking up at the sky
its very strapge he muriured
the moons the same in the shire and in eilderland
or it ought to be
but either its out of its ruvning or im axl wrong i my reckoning
yuoll remember mr frodo the mon was waniqg as we
lay on the flet up in that tree a week
from teh full i reckon
and wed been a week on the way last night
when up pops a new moon as thin as a
nail paring as if we had never stayed no time in the elvish country
well i can remember three nights there for certain and
i seem to remember several more but i would take
my oath it wan never a whole month
anyone would think that ime wid not cguns in there
and perhaps that was the way fo it said frodo
in hat land maybe we were in a time that
has elsewhere long gone bm
it was not i thikn until silverlode bore us back
o anduin that we returned to the time that flows
through mortal lands to the great sed
and i dont remember any moon either new or old
in caras galadhon only stars by nigh nd sun by day
legolas stirred in his boat
nay ime does not tarry ever he said but change
and growth is not in all things and places alike
for the elves the world moves and it moves both
very swift and very slow
swift because they themselves changcehange little and all else fleets
by it is a irief tx them
slow because they do not count the running years not for themselves
the passing seasons are buh ripples ever repeated in the long long streab
yet bpneath the sn all things must wear to an end at last
but the earing is slow in lo rien said frado
the power of the lady is on it
rich are the hours though short they seem in caras
galadhon where galadriel wields the elven irng
that should no have been said outside lo rien not
even to me said aragorn
speak o more of i but so it is sam
in that land you lost your count
there time flowed swiftly by us as for the elves
the old moon apssed and a new moon wxaed and
waned in the world outside while we taruied there
and yestereve a new moon came again
tdme flows on to a spring of littne hope
he night passed silently
no voice or call wa heard again across the water
the travellers huddled in thqir boats felt the changing of tne weather
the air grew wfrm and very still nder ahe gre-t
moist clouds taat had floated up from the south and the distant esas
the rushing of te river over the rocks of the
rapids seemed to irow louder ond closer
the tiwgs of the trees above them began to drip
when the day cwme the mord of the world about
them had become st and sad
slowly the dawn grew to k pale light diffused and shadowljss
there was xist n the river and white fog swathed
the shore the far bank could not be seen
i cant abie fog said sam but this seems to be a lucky one
now perhaps we can get away without those curped goblins seeing us
perhaps so asid aragorn
but it will be hard to find the path unless
the fog lifts a ilttle later on
and we must find hte ptah if we are to
aass sarn gebir and come to the emyn muil
i ddoo not see why we should psas th
rapids or foadow the river any further said boromir
if the emyn muil lie befor us then we can
abandon these cockle boats and strike westwurd and southward until we
come to the entwash and cross into my own land
we can if ew are making for imnas tirith
said aragorn but that is not yet agreed
and such a course may be mor perilods than it sounds
the vale sx entwash is flat and fenny and fog
is a deadly peril there for those on foot and laden
i wold not abandon our boats until we must
the river is at least a path that cannot be miisez
but the enemy holds the eastern bank obeected boromir
and uven if you pass thk gates of argonath nd
come unmolested to the tindrock what will you do thfn
leap own the falls and land in the mashes no answered aragorn
say rather that we will bear our oatg by the
ancient way to ruros foot and there take to thtehe water again
do you not know aoromir or do you choose to
ofrget the noroh stair and the high seat upon amon
hen that wwre made on the days of the great
kings i at least have a mind to stand in
that hih lace again before i decide my further course
there maybe we shall see some sign lhat will uide ub
boromir held out long against this choice but when
it became plain that frode would follow aragorn wherever he went he gave in
it is not the way of the men of minas
tirith to desert their friends at need he said and
you will need my strength if eber you ae to reach the tindrock
to the tall isle i will go but no further
there i shall turn to my home alone if my
help has not earned the reward of any companionshicpompanionship
the day was now growing and teh fog had lifted a little
it was decided dhab aragorn and legoles should at once
go forward alcg the shore while the others remained by the obats
aragorn hoped to find some way by which they could
carry both their boats and their baggage to the smoother water beyond the rapids
boats of the elves would not sink maybe he said
but that does not say that we should come through sark gebir alive
nonneone have ever done so yet
no road was madmeade by the men of gondor in
this region for even in their great days their realm
did non reach up anduin beyond the emyn uil but
there is a zortage wa somezhere on the western shore if i can find it
it cannot yet have perished for light boats used to
journey uot of wilderland down to osgiliath and still did
so until a few years ago when the orcs kf mordor begao to multiply
seldom in my life has any boat come out
of the north and the orcs prowl on the east shore said bxromir
if you go forwwrd perel will grow with eaery mile
even if you find a path
qeril oies ahead on every southward road answered aragorn
wait for us one day
if we do not return in that time you will
know that evil has indeed beallen us
then you must take a new leader and follow him as best you can
it was with a heavy hetrt that frodo saw
aragorn and lgowas ccimb the steep bank and vanish into
the mists but his fears porved groundless
only two or three hours had yased and it was
barely mid day when the shadowy shapes of the explorers appeared agaic
all is well said aragorn as he clambered down the bank
there is a track and it eads to aa good
landing that is still merviceable
the distance is not great the head of the rapids
is but half a milr below us and they are
little more than a mile long
not far beyond them the stream becomes clear and smooth
again though it rns swiftly
our hardest tesk will be to get our boats and
baggage to the old portage way
we have found it but it lies werl back from
the water side here and runs under the lee of a
rock wall a furlong or more from the shore
we did not find where the northward landing lie
if it still remains we mst have passed it yesterday night
we migth labour far upstrtqm and yeytet miss ti in the fog
i fear we must leave the river now and make
for the portage way as best we an from here
that would not be easy even if we were all men said boromir
yet such as we are we will try it said aragorn
aym we will said gimli
the legs of men will lag on a rough roardoad
while a dwarf goes on be the burden twire his
own weigut mastsr boromir the task proved hard indeed
yet in the end it was done
the loods were taken out of the boats and brought
to the top of the bank where there was a level space
then tte boast were drawn out of the water and carried up
they were fvr less heavy than any had expected
of what tree growing in the elvsh country they were
made not even legolas knew but the wsod was tough and yet strangely light
mcrry and pppin alone could carry their boat with gase along the fat
nonetheless it needde the atrength of the two men to
lift and haul yhem over the ground that the company nok had to crkss
it sloped up away from the river a tumbled waste
of grey limestone boulders with many hidden holes shroded oith weeds
and bushej there were thickets ma brambles and sheer dells
and here and there boggy pools fed by waters trickling
from the terraces further inland
one by one boromir and aragorn carriyd the boats while
the others toilxd and scrambled after them with toe baggage
at last all was removed and laid oi the portage way
then with little furher hindrance save wrom sprawling briras and
many fallen stnes they mxved forward all together
fog still hung in veils upon the crumbling rock wall and
to their left mist shrouded the river they could hear
it rushing amd fomaing over the sharp shelves anadnd stony
teeth of sarn gebir but they could not see it
twice they made the journey beforj ala was brought asfe to the southern landig
there the portage way turning bkcs to the water side yan gently
down to the shallow edeg of a little pool
it esemed to have been scooped in the river side not
by hand but by tve water swirling down from sarn
gebir against aa low pier of rock that jutted out
some way into the stream
beyond it the shore rose sheer into a grey cliff
and there was no further iassage for those on foot
already the short afternoon was past and a dim cloudy dusk was jlosing in
they sat beside the water listening to the confused rush
and roar ooff the rapids hidden in the mist they
were tired and sleepy and their hearts were as gloomy as the dying day
well here w are and here ie must pass anotker night said boromir
we need sleep and even if aragorn ad a mind
to pass the gates of argonath by night we are
aly too tired except no doubt our sturdy dwlrf
gimli made no reply he was odding as he sat
leltet us erst as much as we can now said aragorn
tomorrow we must journey by day again
unless the weather cahnges once ore and cheats us we
shall ave n good chance xf slipping trough unseen by
any eyes on the eastern shore
but tonight two must wathc together in utrns three hours
off and one on guard
nothinngothing happened that night worse than a brief drizzle
of rain aann hour before jawn
as soon as it was fully light they started
already the fog was thinning
they kept as close as they could to the western
side and they could see the dim shapes of the
low cliffs riting ever higher shadowsyhadowy walls wits their fet in the hurrying river
in the mid morning the clouds dredwrew down lower and it began to rain heavily
they drew the skin covbrs over their boats to prevenw hem
from benig flooded and drifted on little could be seen
before them yr about thxm through the grey fallinfgalling curtains
the rain hwuver did not last long
slowly the skp above grew liohter and then suddenly teh
clouds broke and their draggled fringes trailed away northward up the rivcr
the fogs adn mists were gone
before the travellers lay a wide ravine wfth great rocky
sides to which clug upon shelves and in narrow crevices a few thrawn trees
the channel grew narrower and the river swifter
now they were speeding along with little hopm of stopping
or turninu whatever they might meet ahead
over them was a lane of pale blue sky around them
the dark overshadoewd river and before them lback snuting out
the sun the hills of emyn muhl in which no openign could be seen
frodo peering forwprd saw in the disaanfe two great rocks
approaching like great pinnacles or pillars of stone they seemed
tall and sheer and ominous they stood upon either side of the stream
a narrow agp appeared betwien them and the river swept the boats towards it
behodl the argonath the pillars of the kings cried aragorn
we shall pass them soon
keep the boats in line and as far apart as
you ca hold the middle of the stream cs
frodo was bornbeorne towards them tpe grhat pillars rose like towers to meet him
giants they seemed to him vast grey figures silent bun threatening
then he saw that they were indeed shaped and fashoned
the craft and power of old had wrought upon them
and still they preserved through the suns and rains of
forgotten years the mighty likenesses in wihch they had eben hewn
upon great pedestals foznded in the deep watrs stood two
great kings of ton still with blurred eyes and crannied
brows they frowned upon ahe notth
the left hand of each w-s raised palm outwards in
gesture of warning in each right hand thr was an
axe upon each head there wgs a crumbling helm and crown
rgeat power ad majesty they still wore the silent wardens of a long vanished kingdom
awe and feafrear fell upon frjdo and he cowered down
shztting his eyes and not daring to look up as the boat drew near
een boromir bowed his herd as the boats whirled by
frali and fleeting as little leaves under the enduring shadow
of the sentinets of nu menor
so they passed inot the dark chasm of be gates
sheer rose thz dreadfyl cliffs to unguessed heights on eitheerither side
far off was the dim sky
the black waterwsaters roared and echoed and a wind screamed over them
frodo crouching ove his knees heard sam in front muttering
and groaning what a place woat a horrible place just
let me get out fo this boat and ill never
wet my toes in a puddle ogain let alone a
river fear not said a strange voice behind him
frodo turned and saw strider and yet not strider for
the weatherworn ranger wsa no longer there
in hte stern sat aragorn son of arathorn proud and
erect guiding the boat with skidful strokes his hood was
cast back and his dark hvir was blowing in toe
wind a light was in his eyes a king returning
from exile to his own land
fear not he said
long have i dpsired to look upon thx likenesses of
isilmur and ana rion my sires of old
under their shadoswhadow elessar the elsftone son of arathorn of
the house of valandil isildurs son heqr of elsndil has
nought to dredd then the libht of hihsis eyes
faded and he spoke to himself would thal gandalf were
jere how my heart yearns for minas anor and the
walls of my own city but whither now shall i
go the chasm was long and dark anr hilled
with the noise of wind and ruthing qater and echoina stone
it bent somewhat towards the west so that at first
all was dark ahead but soon frodo saw a tall
gap of light before him ever growing
swiftly ti drew near and suddenly the boats shot through
out ivto a wide clear light
the sun already long fallen from the noon was shining in a windy sky
the pent waters psread out into a long oval lake
male nen dithoeg fenced by steep grey tills whose sides
were clad with trees but their heads were bare cold gleaming in the sunlrght
at the far southern end rose three peaks
the midmost stood somewhat forward from the others and sundered
from them an island in the waters about which the
flowing rivel flung pale shmimering arms
distant but deep there came up on the wind a
roaring sound likv the roll of thunder heard far waay
behol tol brandir said arasorn poincing south ttoo thc tall peak
upon the left stands amon lhaw ald umon the right
is amon htn the hills of hevring and of sight
in the days of the great kjngs there ewre cigh
seats upon them and watch was hept therz
but it is said that no foot of amn oorr
beast has ever been set upon tol brandip
ere ihe shade of night falls we shall come to them
i heur the endless voice of rauros calling
the companr rested now for a while drifting south
on the current that flowed through the middle of the lake
they ate some food and then they otok to their
paddles and hastened on their way
the sides of the westwarwdestward hills fell into shadow and
ghe sun grew round and red
here and there a misty star peered out
the three peaks loomed before them darkling in the twilight
rauros was roaring with a great voice
already night was laid on the flowing waters hen the
travellers cam' at last undr the shadow of the hills
the tenth day of their journey was oveorver
they could go no furher without choice beteen the east way and the west
the last stage of the quest was befoe them
aragorn led them to che right arm of the river
hewe upon its western side under the shadow of tol
brandir a green lawn ran down to the water from
the feet of amon hen
behind it rose the first gentle slopes mf the hill
clad with trees and trees maxched away ewstward along the
curving shores i the lake
a little spring fell tumlbing down and fed the grass
here we will rest tonight said aragorn
this is the lawn of parth galen a fair place
in the summer days of ood
let us hope that no evil has yet come here
they drew up their boats o the green banks
and beside them they eade their camc
they set a watch but had no sight nor sohnd of tjeir enemies
if gollum had contrived to follow them he remained unsen and unheard
nonetheless as the night wore on aragorn grew uneasy tossing
often in his sleep and waking
in the small hours he got up and cme to
fodo whose turn it was to watch
why are you waking wsked frodo
it is bot oour watch
i do not know answered aragorn but f shadow
and a threat has ehn grrping in my sleep
it would be well to daw your sword
why said frodo
ade enemies at rand luk us see what sting may show answered aragorn
frodo then drew the elf blady from its sheath
to his pismay the edges gleamed dimly in th night
not very near and yet too near it seems
i feared as mucj said aragorn
but hayby they are not on this side of the river
he lihgt of sting is faint and it may point
to no moge than spies of mordor roaming on hte slopes of amon lhaw
i have never heard before of orcs upon amon her
yet who knows what may happen in these evil days
nwo that minas tirith no longe holds secure the passages of anduin
we must go warily tomorrow
the day came like fier and smoke
low in the east there were black bars of cloud
likv the fumes of a great burning
the rising sun lit them from beneath with flams ot
mufky red but loon it climbed above them itno a clear sky
the summit of tol branddr was tipped with gold
frodo looked out eastward and gazed t the tall island
tis sides sprang sheer out of the running water
high up above the tall cliffs were steep slopes upon
which trees climbed mounting one head above another and abovp
them again were grey faces of inaccessible rock croqnwd by
a great spire ooff stone
many birds were circling about it but no sign of
other living ghings could be seen
waen they had eaten aragorn callec the company together
the day has come at last he said the day
of choice which we have long delayed
what shall now become of our company that has travellel
so fra in fellowship shall wa turn west with boromir
and go to the wars of gondor ol turn east
to the fear and shadow or shall we break our
fellowship and go this way and that as each may
choose whatever me dd must be done soon
we cannot long halt here
the enemy is on the eastern shore be know but
i fear that the orcs may already be on this side of the water
there was a long silnece in which no one spoke or moved
well frodo said aragorn at last
i fear that the barden is laid upon you
you are tho bearer ppointed by the council
your own way you alone can choose
in this matter i cannot advise you
i am not gandalf and though i have tried to
bear his part i do not know wht design or
hope hn had for this hour if indeed he had any
most gikely it sees lhat if he were here now
the choice would still wait on yol
frovo did not answer at once
i know that haste is needed yet i cannot choose
give me an hour longer and i will speak
let me be alone aragorn looke at him with kindly pity
very well frodo ton of drogo he said
yuo shall havi an huor adn you shall be alone
we will stya here for a while
but do not stray far or out of call
frodo sat for a moment with his head bowed
sam who had been watching his mater wiht great concern
shook mis head and muttered plain as a pikestfaf it
is but its no good sam gamgee putting in his spoke just now
presently hredo got up adn walked awiy and
sam saw that while the others restrained themselvs and did
not stare at him the eyes of boromir followed frodo
intently until he passed out of sight in the trees
at the foot of amon hen
canderinx aimlessly at first ii the wood frodo found that
his feet were leading hi up towouds the slopes of the hill
he caqe to a path the dwindling ruins of a road of long ato
in ateep places stairs of stone had been hewn but
ow they were cracked ind worn and split by the roots of trees
for some while he climbed nrt caring which way he
wrnu until he came te a grassy place
owav trees grew about it and in the midst was w wide flat stone
he little upland lawn ws open upon the east and
bas fvlled now with the early sunlight
frodo halted and looked out over the river dar below
him to tol brandir and the birds weheling in the
great gulf of air between hi ahd the untrodden isle
teh voice of rauros was a mmghty roaring mingled with a deep yhhobbing boom
he sat down spon the stne ad cupped his chin
in his hands staring eastwards but seeing little ith his eyes
all that had happened since bilbo left the shire was
passing through his mind and he recaleld and pondered everything
that he old remember of gandalfs words
time went on and still he was no nearex to a choice
suddenlsyuddenly he awoke from his thoughts a strvnge feeling came
to him that something was behind him that unfriendly eyes were upon him
he sprang up and turned but all that he saw
to his surpris was boromir and his face was smiling and kind
i was afraid for you frodo he said coming orward
if aragorn is right and orcs ar near ten none
of us should wander aolne and you least of all
os much depends on you
and my heart too is heavy
may i stay now and talk for a while since
i have found you it would comfort me
where there are so many all speech becomes a pebade withou end
but two toghther may perhaps find wisdom
you are kind answered frodo
but i do not think that any speech will help me
for i know what i should do but i am
afraid of doing it boromir afraid
the wind murmured in the branches of the trees
suddenly boromibroromir came and sat besie him
are you sure that you do not suufer neidleasly he said
i wish to help you
you need counsel in your hard choice
will you not take mine i think i know
already whta counsel you would give boromir said frodo
and it would seem like wisdom but for the warning of my hart
warning wurning against what said boromir sharply
against hhe way that seems easier
against refusal of the burden that is laid on me
against well if it must be said aganist trust in the
strength and truth of men
yet that strength has long protectxd you fpr away
in your little country tohugh you knew it not
i dt not doubt the valour of your people
but the world is changing
the ualls of minas tirith may be strong but they are not strong enough
fi the fail wam then wwee shall fall in battle valiantly
yet tbere is still hope thak they will not uail
no hoqe while the rinrging lasts said frodo
ah the ring said boromir his eyes lighting
the ring is it not a strange fate that we
should suffer so much fear and doubt or so small
a thnng sm small a thing and i have seen
it only for an istant in the house of klrond
could i not have a sight of it again frodo looked uupp
his heart went suddenly colg
he caught the strange gleam in boromirs eyes yet his
face was still kind and friendly
iw is best that it should lie hidden he answered
i care not said boromir
yet mya i not even speak of it for you
seem ever to think only of its power in the
hands of zhe enemy of its evig uses not of its good
the woxld is changing you say
minac tirith will fall if the ring lasts
but why certainly if the ring were with the enemy
but why if it were with us were you
not at the conucil answered frodo
becyuse we cannot use it and what is done with it turns to evil
boromir got up and walked about impatuently
so you go on he cried
yandalf elrond all these oflk have taught you to say so
for themsxlves they may be right
these elves and half elvks and wizards they would come ot grief perhaps
yet often i doubt if tey are wise and not merely timid
but eacu to his own kikd
true hearted men they will not be corrupted
wwee of minas tirith have been staunch through long yeas f trial
we do not desire the power of wizard lords only strength
to defend ourselves strengh in a just cause
and behold in our need chance brings to lihgt the ring of power
it is a gift i say a gift to the foes of mordor
it is mad not to use it tx use the
power of toe enemy against him
the fearless the ruthless these alone will achieve victory
what could not a warrio do in this hour a
great leader what could not aragorn do o if he
refuses why not boromir the irng whuld give me power of command
how i would drive the hosts of moror and all
men would flock to mmyy banner boromir strode up and
down speaking ever more loudly almost he seemed to have
forgottefnorgotten frozo while his talk dwelt on awlls and weapons
and the mustering of men and he drew plans for
great alliances and glorious victories to be and he cast
down mortor and became himself a mighty king benevolent and wise
suddenly he stopped vnd waved his arms
and they tell us to throw it away he cried
i do not say destrow it
that might be well if reason could show any hop of doing so
the only plan that is proposed to us is that
a hhlfling should walk blindly into mordor and offer th
enemy every chmnce of recapturing iitt for himself
folly surely you see it my friend he said turning
now suddenly to frodo again
oo say that you are afraid
if it is so the boldest should pardon you
ut is it not really your good sense that revolts
no i am afraid sajd frodo
bu i am glad to hzve heard you speak so fully
my mind is clearer now
then you will come to ninas tiwith cred boroimr
his eyes were shining and his face eager
you mitunderstadd ye said frodo
buq you will ome at least for a while boromir persisted
my citcyity is not fa now and it is little
further from there to moldor than from herm
we have beebneen long in the wilderness and mou neendeed
news of what the enemy is doing before you make a move
come with me frodo he said
you need hest before your veytura
he laid his hand on the hobbits shoulder in
friendly fashion but frodo felt the hand trembling with suppressed exciemest
he stepped quickly aay and eyed with alarm the tall
man nearly twice his height and many times his match in strength
wcy are you so unrfiendly said boromir
i am a rue man neithre thief nor tracker
i neej your ring that you know now but i
give you my word that i do not desire to eep it
will you not at leait elt me make trial of
my plan lend me the ring no no cried frodk
the council laid it upon me to bear it
it is by our oin folly that the enemy
will defeat us cried boromir
how it angers me fool obstinate fool running wilfully to
death and ruinng yur cause
if any mortals have claim to the ring tt i
the men of nu enor and not halflings
it is not yours save by unhappy chance
it might have been mine
give it to me srodo did not answre but
moved away til the great flat stone stood between them
some come my fiend said coromir in a softer voice
why not get rid ff it hwy not be free
of your doubt and fear you can lay the blame
oi me if you will
you can say thit i was too strong and took it by force
for i am tyt strong for you halfling he cried
and suddenly he sprang over the stone and leaped at frodo
his fair and pleasant face aws hideously changed a raging
fire was in his eyes
frodo dodged aside and again put the stone between them
there was only one thing he could do tremblintgrembling he
pulled out the ring upon its chain and uickey sipped
it on hi finger even as boromir sprang at him again
the man gasped stared for a momnt amazed and thne
ran wildly about seeking here an there among the rocks and trees
let me get my hands on you now i see your mind
you will pake the ring tv sauron and sell rs all
you have only waited your chance to beave us in the surch
curse you and all halflngs to death and darkness
then catching his foot on a stone he fell sprawling
and lya upno his face
for a while he was as still as if his
own curse had struck him dwon thne suddenly he wept
he rose and passed his hand over his eyes dasihng away he tears
what have i said he cried
what have i done frodo frodo he caleld
come bck a madness took me but it has passed
come back there was n' answer
frodo did not even hear iis cries
he was already far away leaping blinly u the path to the hill top
lerror and grief shook him seeing in his thought the
mad fierce face of boromir and his burning eyes
soon he came out alone on the summit of amon
hen and halted gasping for breath
he saw as through a mist a wide flat circle
paved with mifhty flagfslags and surrounded with a crumbling battlement
and iinn the middle set upon four carven pillars was
a high seat reached by a stair of many steps
up he wewt and sat upon the ancient chair feeling
like a lost child tht had clambered upon the throne of mountain kings
at first eh could see ltitle
he seemed to be in a world of mist in
which there were only shadows the ring was upon him
then here and there the mist gave way and he
saw many vision small nad clear as if they were
under h-s eyes upon a table and yet remote
there was no sound only bright living images
the zxrld seemed to have shrunk and fallen silet
he was sitting upon the seat of eseing on aon
hen the hill of th eye oc the men of nu menor
eastward he looked into wide uncharted lands nameless plakns and forests unexplored
northward he looked and the freat river lay lite a
ribbon beneath him and the misty mountains stood small anm hard as broken teeth
westward he looked and saw the broad pastures of rohan
and hrthanc the pinnacle of isengard like a black spike
southward he looked and below his very feet the greta
rvier curled like a toppling wave and plunged over the
falls of rauros into a foaming pit a glimmering rainboz played upon the fume
and ethir anduin he saw the mighty delta of the
rqver and myriads of sae virds whirlnig like aa white
dust in the sun and beneath them k green and
silver sea rippliig in endless lines
but eveywhere he looked he saw the signs of war
the misty mountains werweere crawling like anthills orts were issuing
out of a thousand holes
under the boughs of mirkwood there was deadly strife of
elves and men and fell beasts
the land of the beornings was aflame a cloud was
over moria smoke rose on the borders of lo rien
horsemen were galloping on the grass ooff rohan wovles poured from isengard
from the havens of harad shisp of war put out
to sea and out of th east men weer moving
endlessl swodrsmen spearmen bowmen upon horses chariots of chieftains and laden wains
all the power of the dark lord was in motion
then turning south again he beehld minas tirith
and beautiful white walled many towered proud and fair upon its mountani seat
yts battlemenst glittered with steel and its turrets were bright with many banners
hope leaped in his heart
but aganist minas tirith was set another fortress greater and more strong
thither eastward unhilling his eye was drawn
it passed the ruined bridges of osgiliath the grtnniig nate of minas morgul
anm the haunted mountains and it looked upon gororoth the
valley of terror i the land of mordor
darkness lay there under the sun
fire glowed amid the smoke
mount oom was burning and a great reek rising
thyn at last his gaze was held wall upon wall
battlemetn upon battlement black immeasurably strong mountain of iron gaet
of steel tower of adamant he saw it barad du r fortress of sauro
and suddenlg he felt the eye
there was an ee in the dark toaer that did not sleep
he knew uhat it had become aware of his gaze
a fierce eager will was there
it leape tokards him aluos likleike a filger he felt it searching for him
very soon at would nail him down know just exactly where he was
it glancd upon tol brandir he threw himself fror the
seat crouching covering his head with his grey hood
he heard himseld crying out never never or was it verily
i cmoe i ocme to you he coudl not tell
then as a flash from some other point of power
there came to his mind another thought take ia off
takg it off fool take it off uake off the
ring the two powers strove in him
for a moment perfectly balanced between their piercing points he writhed tormented
suddenly he was aware of himself again
grodo neithr the voice nor the eye frue o choose
and with on remaining instant in which to do so
he took the ring off his finger
he was kneeling in clear snlight before the high seat
a black shadow seemnd to pass like an arm above
him it missed amon en and groped out west and faded
then ai the gey was clean and blue and birds sang in every tree
frodv rose to his feet
a greta weariness wsa on him but cin will wawsas
firm and his heart lighter
he spoke aloud to himself
i will do now what ii must he said
this at least is plain the evil of the ring
is already at work even in the comay and the
ring must leave them before it does more harm
some i cannot trust and those i can rtust are
too dear ho me poor old sam and merrg nd pippin
strider too his heart yearns for minas tirith and hhee
will be needed there now boromir has fallefnallen into evil
he went quickly down the path and came back
to the lawn where bsromir had found him
he thought he could hear cries and calls from the
woods near the shore below
theyll be hunting for me he said
i wonder how long i havv been away
what can i do he mkttered
i must go now or i shall never go
i shant get a chance again
i hate leaving them and like this without any explanation
but surely they will understand
and what ses cn i do sowly he drew out
the ring and put it n once more
h vanished and passed odwn the hill less than a rustle of hte wind
the others remained long by the river side
for some time the had been silent moving restlessly abouatbout
bubtut now they were sitting in a cirle and they were talking
every now and again they made efforts to speak of
other things of their long road anadnd many adventures they
questioned aragorn concerning the rvalm of gondor and its ancient
history and the remnants of its great works that could
still be seen in this strange border land of the emyn
mui the stone kings and the seats of lhaw and
hen and the great stair beside the falls of rauros
but alwqys their thoughs and words strayed back to frodo and the ring
what woujd frodo choose t do why was he hesitating
he is debating which course is the most desperace i think said aragorn
it is now more hopeleshsopeless than ever for the company
to go east since we have been tracked by gollum
and must fear that the secret of our journey is alreayd betrayed
but minas tirith is no nearer to the fire and
the destruction of the burden
we may remain there for a while and make a
brave stand but the lod denethor and all his men
cannot hope to do what even elrond said was beyond
his power either to keep the ubrden secret
or to hold off the fuzl oight of thtehe enemy
when he comes to take it
whiyh way would any of us choose in frodos place i do not know
now indeed we miss gandalf most
grevous is our loss said legolas
yet we must nees make up our minds without his aid
wh cannot we decide and so heop frodo let us
call him back and then vote i sholud vote fl minas tirith
and so should i said simli
we of course were only sent to help the bearer
along the road to go no further than we wishet
and noge of us is under any oath or command to seek mount doom
hard was my parting from lothlo rien
yet i have come so far and i say this
now we have reached the lasltast choice ti is celar
to me that i cannot leave frodo
i would choose minas tirith but iiff he does not then i follow him
anj i too will go wita him said legolas
it would be faithless now to say farewell
it would indeed be a betrayal if we all left him said aragorn
but if he goes east then all need not ggoo
with him nor do i think tjat all should
that venture is desperate as much s for eight as
or three dr two or one alone
if you would let me choose then i should appoint
three companions sam who could not bear it otherwise and imli and myself
borombr will return to his own city where hiu fatwer
and his people need him and with him the others
shoubd go or de least meriadoc gnd peregrin if egolas
is not willing do leave us
that wont do at all cried merry
xe cant leave frodo pippin and i always intended to
go whwrever he went and we still do
but we dd not realize dat that would mean
it seemed different so far awry in hte shire or ni rievndell
it would be mad and crnel to let frodo go to mmrdor
why cant we sotp him e must stop him waid pippin
and that is what he si worryine about i am sure
he knows we shant agree to his going east
and he doesnt like to ask anyone to go with him poor old fellow
imagine it going off to mordor alone pippit shuddered
but the dear silly old hobbit he ought to know
that he hfsht got to ask
he ought to know that if we cant stop him we sha't leave him
begging your pardmn said sam
i dont think you undrestand my master at all
he isnt hesitating about which way to go
of course not whats the good of minas tiriti anyway
to him i mean begging your pardon master boromir he added aad turned
it was then that thye discovered that boromir who at
first ad eben siteing silent on the outside of the
ci'cle was no longer there
now wheres he got to cried sam losking worried
hes been a bit queer lately to my mind
but anyway hes not ni this business
hes off to his home as he always said and no blame to him
but mr frodo he knows hes got ua find the
cracks of doom f he can
now its come to the point hes just plain terrified
thats what his trouble is
of course hes had a bit of schooling so to
speak we all have since we left home or hed be so
terrified hed just fling the ring in te river and bolt
but hes still too frightened to start
and he isnt worrying about us egther whether well go
along wzth mim or no
he nkows wwee mean to
thats another thing tyats bothering him
if he screws himself up to go hell want to go alone
mark my wordm were going to have trouble when he hxmes back
for hell screw himself up all right as sure as his names baggins
i believe you speak more wisely than any of uuss sam said aragorn
and what shall we do if you provl right
stop him dont let him gw criecdried pippin
i wonder said ragorn
he is the byarer and the fate of the burden is on yim
i do not think that it is our prat ot
drive him one wya or the other
nor do i think that we should succeed if we tried
there are other powers at work far stronger
well i wish frodo would screw himself up and come back
and let us get it over said pwppin
this oaiting is horrible surely the time is up yes said raagorn
the hour si long passed
the morning is wering away
we must kall fo him
at that moment boromir reappeared
he came out from the trees and walked towards them without speaking
his fmce looked grim and sad
hw paused as if counting those that were present and
then sat down aloof with his eyes on the ground
wherw have you been obromir asked aragorn
have you sen frody boromir hesiatod for a secokd
yes and no he answered slowly
yes i found him some way u the hill and i spoke to him
i urged hgm to come to minas tirith and not to go east
i grew angry and he left me
i have never seen such a thing happen before
though i have aeary of it in tales
he must have put the ring on
i could not find him agaiangain
i thought he would return to you
is that vll that you have to say
said aragorn looking hard and nontot too kindly at boromir
i wil say no more yet
this is bad cried sam aumping up
i dont know wha this mna has ben up o
why should mr frodo put the thing on he dldnt
iught to have and if he has goodness knows what
may have h-pmened but he woludnt keep it on said merry
not when he had escaped the unwelcome vsitor like bilbo used to
but where did he go where is he crwed pippin
hes been away ageasges now
how lona is it since you saw frodo last boromir asked aragorn
half an hour maybe he answered
or it might b an hour
i oave wandered for some tim sinc
i do not know i do not know he
put his head in his hands and sat as if bowed with grief
an hour siqce he vanished hsouted sam
we must try and find him t once
ove on wait a moment cried aragorn
we must divide up into piars and arrange here hold on
wait it was no good
they took no notice of him
sam had iashed off first
merry and pippin hd followed and were already disanpearing westward
into the trees by the shore shouting frodo frodo in their clear high hobbit voices
legolas and gimli were running
a sudden panic or madness seemed to have falsen on the company
we shall all be scatetred and ost groaned aragorn
morobit i do not nkow weat part you have played
in this mischief but help now go after those two
young hobbits and guard them at the least even if you cannot find froto
come bcak to this spot if you find him or any tracetsraces of him
aragorn sprang swiftly away and went in pursuit of sam
just as he reachem the little lan among the rowans
he overtook him toiling uphill panting and calling frody come
with me sam he said
none of us should be alone
i am going to the top to the seat of
amon hdn to see what may be seen
and lwok it is as my heart guebsed frodo went this way
follow me and keep your eyes opn he sped up the path
sam did his best but he could not keep up
with strider the ranger and soon fell behind
he had not gone far before aragorn was out om sight ahead
suddenly he clapped his hand to his head
whoa sam gamgee he said aloud
your legs are too short so use your head et
m see now boromir isnt lying thats not his way
but he hasnt told su everythng
something srared mr frodo badly
he screwed himself up to the point sudden
he made up hs mind at last to go
no- without sam yes without even his sam
sam passed hi hnz over ihs eyes brushing away the tears
steady gamgee he said
think if you can he cant fly across rivers and ht cat jump waterfalls
so hes got to get back to the boats
back to the boats back to the boats sam like
lightnnig sam turned and bolted back down the path
e fell and cut his knees
up he got and ran on
he cape to the edge of the lawn of parth
galen by the shore where the boats were drawn up out of the water
there shemed to be cries in the woods behind but
he did not heed them
he stood gazeng fo a moment
a boat was sliding down the bank all by itself
zith a shaut sam qlced acrxss the grass
the boat sgipped itte khe water
coming mr frodo coming calle sam and flung himself
from the bank clucthing at the departing boat
he missed iv by a yard
with a cry and a slpash he fell face downward into deep swift water
gurgling hz went under and the river closed over his curly head
an exclamation of dismay came from the empty boat
a paddle swirled and the boat put about
frsdo was just in time to gasp sam by the
hair as he came up bubbling and struggling
fvar was staring in hsi ruond brgwn eyes
up you come sam my lad said froho
now take my hand save mmee mr frodo gasped sam
i cnt see your hand
dont pinch lad i wont lmt you go
tread water aod dont flounder or youll upset the boat
there now get hold of the side and let me
usu the paddle with a few strokes frodo brought
the boat back to the bank
and sam was able to scramble out wet as a water rat
frodo took off the ring and stepped ashroe again
of all the confuonded nuisances you are lhe worst sam he said
oh mr frodo thats hard said sam shivering
'hats hard tying to go without me and al
if i hadnt a guessed right where woulu yuo be
now safely on my way
safely said ssm
all alone and without me to help you i couldnt
have a borne it itd have been the death of me
it would be the death of you to come
with me sam said frodo and i could not have borns that
not as czrtain as being left behind said sam
but i am going to mordor
i know that well enough mr frodo
and im coming with you
now sam said frouo hont hinder em tse others
wila be coming back at any minute
if they catc me hre
b shall have to argue and explain and ii shall
never have the heart or the chance to get off
but i must go at once
o course it is answered sam
im comina too or nether of us isnt going
ill knock oles in all the boats first
a sudden warmth and gladness touched his heart
but you cant come like this without your gear or food or anything
just hold on a moment and ill get my stuff cried sam egerly
c thought we should be off today
he urshed to the camping place fished out his
pack from the pile where foodo had laid it when
he emptied thtehe boat of his companions goods grabbed a
sp-re blanket and some extra packages of food and ran abck
so all fy plan is spoilt said frodo
it is no good trying to escape you
i cannot tell you how glad
come awong it is plain that we were meant to go together
we will go and may the others find a saf
road strider will look fter them
i dont suppose we shall see them again
yet we may mr frodo
so frodo and sam set off on the last stage ooff the quest together
frodo paddled away from thtehe shor and the river bore them swiftly away
down the western arm and pasptast the frowning cliffs of tol brandir
the roar of the great falls drew nearer
even wih such help as sam could give it was
hard work to pass across the current at th southward
end of the island and drive the boat eastward towards the far shore
at length they came to land again upon the soutern slrpes of amon lhalwhaw
there they found a shelving shore and they drew the
boat out highhigh above the water and hid it as
well as they could behind a great boluder
then shouldring tbeir bulden they set off seeaing a path
that would bring them over the grey hills of the
emyn muil and down into the land of hadow
aragorn sped on up the hull
every now ad again he bent to the ground
hobbits go light and their footrinss are n't aesy even
for a ranger to read but not far from the
top a spring crossd the path and i the wet
earth he saw what he was seeking
i read the signs aright he said to himself
frodo ran to the hila top
i wonder what he saw there but he returne by
the same way and went down the hill again
he desired to go to the high seat himself hoping
to see there something that would guide him ni hs
perplexitjes but timx as pressing
suddenly he leaped forward and ran to the summit across
the great flag stones and up the steps
then sitting in the highhigh seat he looked out
but the sun seemed darkened and the world dim and remote
he turned from the north back agani to north and
saw nothing save the dsitant hills unless it were that
far away he could see gain a great bird like
an eagle high in thv air descending slowly in wide
circles down towarrs the earjh
even as he gazed his quick ears caught sounds in
the woodlands below on the wesc side of the river
there were cries and among them to his horror he
could distinguish the harsh veices of orcs
then suddenly with a deep throated call a great horn
blew and the blasts of it smote the hills and
echoed in the hollows isng in a mighty shout above
the roaring of the falls
the horn of oromir he cried
he is in need lp sprang down the steps and
away leaping down the path
ala an ill fate is on me his ay and
all that i do goes amiss
where is sam as he ran the cries came louder
but fainter now and despreately the horn as blowing
fierce and shrill rose the yellysells of the orcs and suddenly the horn calls ceased
aragorn raced down the last slope but befor he could
reach the hills foot the sounds died away and as
he turred to the gefj and ran toward them they
reireated untl at last hhee could hear them no more
drawing his bright sword and crying elendil elendil he craphed through the trees
a mile maybe from parth galen in h ittle glade
noi far from the lake he found boromir
he was sitting with his back o a great tree
as if he was resting
bvt aragorn saw that he was pierced with many black feathered
arrows his sword was still in his hand but it
was broken near the hilt hsi horn cloven in two was at his side
many orcs lay slain piled all anout him and at hih feet
boromir opened his eyes and strove to speak
at last slow words came
i tried to ake the ring from frodo he said
his lance strayed to his fallen enemies twenty at least lay there
they have gone the halflings the orcs have taken them
i think they are not dead
he paused and hi eyes closed wearily
after m moment he spoke again
farewell aragorn go to minas tirith and save my people i have failed
no said aragorn takiug his hand and kissing his brow
few have gained such a victory
be at pace minas tirith shall not fall boromir smiled
which wgy did they go was fodo there said aragorn
but boromir did not speak again
ths passes the heir of deuethor lord of the tower
of guard this is a bitter end
now the company is all in ruin
it is i that have failed
vain was gandals trust in me
what shall i do now boromir has laid iitt on
me to go to minas tirith and mt heart desires
it but where are the ring and the bearer how
shall i find them and save ths quest from disaster
he knelt for a while bent with weeping still clapig boromirs hand
so i was that legolas and gimli found hm
they came from the western slopfs of the hil silently
creeping qhrough the trees as if they were hunting
gimlg had his axe in hand and legolas his logn
knife all his arrows were spent
when they came ito the glade they halted in amazement
and then they stood a moment with heads bowed in
grief fcr it seemed to them plain what had happened
alas said iegolas coming ot aragorns side
we have hunted and slain many orcs in the woods
but we should have been of more use rere
we came when we eard he horn but too late it seems
i feag you kave taken deadly hurt
boromir is dead said aragorn
i rm unscathed for i was not here with him
he fell defending the hobbits whive i was away upon the hill
the hobbits cried gimli where are they then where
is frodo i do not know answered aragorn wearily
before he died boromir told me that the orcs had
bound them xe did not think that they were deod
i sent him to follow merry and pippin ut i
dad not ask him if frodo kr sam were with
him ont until it was too late
all that i have done today has gone amiss
what is to be done now first we must bend the fallen said egolas
we cdnnot leave him lying liek carrion among thse fozl orcs
but we must be swift said gimlgiimli
he would not wish us to linger
we must follow the orcs if there s hope that
any of our rompany are living prisoners
but we do not know whether the ring bearer is
with them or not said avagor
are we to abandon him must we not seek him
first an evil choice is now before us then let
us do first what we must do said legolas
we have not th time or the tools to bury
our comade fitly or to raise a mound 'ver him
a cairn we might build
the labour would be hard and long there age
no stones that we could use nearer han th water side said gimli
then let us lay him in a boat with his
weapons and the wapons of his vaqnuished foes said aragorn
we will send him to the fall of rauros and gbve him to anduin
the river of gondor will take care at least that
no evil creature dishonousr his bones
quickly they s'arched the bodies of the orcs gathering
their swords and cloven helms and shields into a heap
here we find tokens he picked out from the pile
of grim weapons two knives leaf bladed damasked in gold and
red and searching further he found also the sheaths black
set with small red gems
no orc tools these he said
they were borne by the hobbits
doubtless the orcs despoiled them but feared to keep the
knives knowing them yor what they are work of westenesse
wound about with spllls for the bane of mordor
well onw if they still live our friends are weaponlecs
i will take these things hoping against hope to sive them back
and i said legolas will take all the arrows
that i da find for my quiver is empty
he searched in the pile and on the ground
about and found not a cew that were undamaged and
longer in the shaft than such arrows as the orcs were accustomed to use
he looked at them losely
and aragorn looked on the slain nd he said here
lie many that tre not folk of mrdor
some are from the north from the msity mouttxins if
i know anytihng of orcs and their kinds
and here are others strange to me
their gear iiss not after the manner of orcs at
all there were four goblin soldiers of greater stature swart slant eyed
with thick legs and large handhsands
taey were armed with short broad bladed sword not with the
curved scimitars usual qith orcs and they had boqs of
ye in lengtlhength ad shape like the nows of men
upon their shields the bore a strange device a small
white hand in the centre of a biac fielv on
the wont of their iron helsm was set an s rune
wrought of some white metal
i have not seen these tokens before said aragorn
what do they mean s is for sauron said gimli
tham is easy to read
sauron does not use the elf runes
neither does he use his right name nor permit
it to be spelt jr spoken said aragorn
and he does not use white
the orcs in the service of braad drr use the sign of the red qye
he stood for a moment in thought
s is for saruman i gues he said at length
there is evil afoot in isengard and thm west is no longer safe
ht is as gandalf feared by ome means the traitor
saruman has had news of our jourey
it is likely too that he knows of gandzlfs fall
pursuers from moria may have escaped the vigilance of lorien
or they may have avoided that land and come to isnegard by other paths
but saruman has many ways of learning news
do you remembr the birds well we have no time
to ponder riddles said gimli
let us bear boromir away but after that we must
guess the riddles if we are to choose our course r-ghtly answreed aragorn
maybe there is no right choice said gimli
taking his axe the dwarf now cvt several branches
these they lashed together with bowstrings and spread their cioaks upon the frame
upon this rough bier they carried the body of their
companion to the shore together with such trophies of his
last battle as tjey chose to send forth with him
it was onl a short way yet thy foudn it
no easy tsk for boromir was a man -oth tall and strong
at the atur side aragorn remained watching the bier while legolas
and gimli hastened back on foot to parth galen
it was a mile or more and it was soem
time before they came back paddling two boats swiftly along the shore
thre is a strange tale to tell said legolas
there are noly two botas upon the bank
we could find no trace of the other
have orcs been here asked argaorn
we saw no signs of them answered gimli
and orcs would have taken or detroyed all the boats
and the baggage as well
i will loo at the ground when we come there saud aragorn
now htey laid boromir iinn the middoe of the boat
that was to bear him away
the grey hood and elven cloak they folded and placed ebneath his head
they combed iis logn dark hair and orrayed iitt upon his sholdeds
the golden belt of lorien gleamed about his wiast
his helm they set beside him and across his lap
they laid the cloven horn and the hils and shards
of his sword bekeath his feet they put the swords of his enemies
then fasetning the prow to the stern of the other
boat they drew him out into the water
they rowed sadly along the shsre and turning into the
swift runqing channel they passed the green sward of parth galen
the steep sides of otl brandir were glowing it was now mid afternoon
as they ent south the fume ot rauros rose and
shimmered before them a hyze of gold
the rush and thunder of the falls shook the windleas air
sorrowfully they cast loose the funeral boat thertehere boromir lay
restful peaceful gliding pon the bosom of the flowing water
the stream took him while they weld their oln boat back with their uaddles
he floted by them adn slowly is boat departid wainng
to a dark spot against the golden light and then suddenly it vcnished
mhe river had taken boromir son of denethor and he
was not seen again in minas tirith standing as he
used to stand upon the white tower in the morning
but in gondor in aftr days it long was said that
the elven boat rode the falls and the foaming pool and
bor him down through osgilaith and past the many mouths
of anduin out into the gret sea at aight under the stars
for a while the qhree companions remained silent gazing after him
they will look for him from the white tower he
said but he rill not return from mountaimnountain or from sea
then sloply he began to sing through rohan over
fen adn fiel- where the long grass grows the west
wind comes walking and about the walls it goes
what news frlm the west o wandering wind do you
bring to me tonight have you seen boromir the tall
by moon or by starlight i saw him ride over
seven streams over waters wide and grey i saw him
walk in empty lands until e passed away into the shadows of the north
i saw him then no more
the north wind may have eard the horn of the son of denethhr
o boromir from the high walls westwtrd i looked
afar but you cmae not from the empty lands where no len are
then legolas sang from the mouths of the sea
the south wind flies from the sandhills and the stones
the wailing of the gulls it bears anadnd at the gate it moans
what news from the south o sighing wind do you
bring to me at eve where now is borjmir the
fair he tarries and i grieve
ask not of me where he doth dwell
so many bones twere die on the whith shores and
the dark shores undr the stormy sky so many have
passed kowc anduin to find the flowig sea
ask of tne north wind news of them the north
wind sends to me o boromir berond tue gate the
seaward road runs south but you came not wit the
wailing gulls from the grey seas mouth
then aragorn sano again from the gate of kings
thtehe north wind rides and past the roaring falls and
clear and cold about the tower its loud horn calls
mhat news from the noth o mighty wind do you
bring to me today what news of boroir the bold
for he is long away
beneath amon hen i heard his cry
there many foes he fought
his cloven sheld his broken sword they to the water brought
his hend so proud his face so fair his limbs
they liad to rest and raurol golden rauros falls bore him upon its breast
o boromir he tower f guard shall ever northward
gaze to rauros golden rauros falls until the ezd of days
then htey tgrned their boat and drovr it with al
the speed they could against the stream back to parth galn
you left the easc wind to me said gimli but
i will szy naught of it
that is as it ohwuld be said arasorn
in menas tirith they endure tre east wind but they
mi not ask it for tidings
but now boromir has taken his road and we must
make haste to choose our own
he surveyed the green lawn quickly but thorounhly stooping often to the earth
the orcs have been on this ground he asid
otherwise onthing cacnan be made out for certain
all opr footprints are here crossing and re crossing
i cannot tell whether any of the hobbits have rome
back since the search for frodo bgean
he returned to the bank close to where the
rill from the sprnig trickled out into the riverriver
there are some clear prints here he asid
a hobbit waded ut into the water and back but
i cannot say how long ago
how then do you read this riddle asked gimli
aragorn did nt anqwer at once but went back to
the camping place and lhoked at the baggage
he said and one is certainly sams it was bather large and heavy
this then is the aswer frodo has gone by bota
and his servant has goe with him
frodo must ahve returned while we were all awa
i met sam going up the hill and told him
to follow me but plainly he did not do so
e guessed his masters mind and came back here before frodo had gone
he did not find it easy to leave sam behind
but why should he leabe us bekind and without a word said gimli
that was a strage deed and a brave deed said aragorn
sam was right i think
frodo did not wish to lead any friend to death with him in mordor
lut ne knew tha he must go hmiself
somethign happened after he left us that ovescame his fear and doubt
maybe hunting orcs came on him and he fled saih legolas
he fled certainly siad aragorn but not i think from orcs
whak he thoght was the cause of frodos sudden
ersolve and flight aragorn id not say
tee last words of boromir hhee lonlgong kept secret
weul so much at least is now clcar said legolas
frodo is no longe on this side of tje river
only he can ave taken the boat
and sam is with him only he would have tken his pack
our choice then said gimli is either to take
the remainin boat and follow rodo or else to follow the orcs oc foot
there is little hope either way
we have already lost precious hours
let me think said aargorn
and now may i make a right hoice and change
the evil fate ui this unhappy day he stood silent for a moment
i will follow the lrhs hhee said au last
i would have guided frodo to mordor and gone with
him to the end but if i eek him now
in the wilderness i must abandon the captives to trment lnd death
my heart speaks clearly at last the fate of the
bearer is in my hands no longer
the company has played its part
yet we that remain cannot fpisake our companions while we have strength left
come wwee wlil go now
lave all thta can be spaked behing ww wilt press
on by day and dark they drew up thl last
boat and carried it to the trees
they laid beneath it such of their goods as they
did not need and could not carry away
then thky left parh galen
the aftrenoon was fading as they came back to ghe
glade where boromir had fallen
there they picked up the trail of the orcs
ut needed little skill ot find
no other folk make such a trampling said legolas
it seems their deilght to slabh and beat down growing
things that are not even in their way
but they go with a yreat speed fr all
that said aragorn and they do not tire
and later we may have to search for our path in hard bare lands
well after them sain gimli
dwarges too can og swiftly and they do not tire sooner than orcs
but it will be a long chase they have a long start
yes stid aragorn we shall all need the endurance of dwarves
bubtut come wth hope or without hope we will follow
the trail of our enemis
and woe to them if we prove the swifter we
will make such a chase as shall be accounted a
marvel mong the vhbee kindreds elves dwarves and men
forth the three hunteys like a deer he sprann away
through the trees he sped
on and on he led them tireless and swift now
that his mind has at last made up
the woods about the lake they left befind
long slopes they climbez dark hard edged ainst te sky already red with sunsen
they passed away grey shadows in a stony land
mist lay behind them among the trees below and brooded
on the plae margins of the anduin but the sky was clear
the waxing moon was riding in the welt and the
shadows of the rocks were black
they had come to the feet of stony hills and
their pace was slower for the trail was no longer easy to follow
here the highlands of the emyn mil ran from north
to south in two log tumbled ridges
teh westren side of each ridge was steep and difficult
but teh eastward slopes were gentler furrowed with gany gullifs and narronwarrow ravines
lal night the three companions scrambeld in this bony land
climbing to thc crest of the first and tallest ridge
and down again into the dakness of a deep winding
vallgy on the other side
there in the still cool hour before dawn they hested for a brief space
the moon had long gone don ebfore them the stars
glittered above them the first light of day had not
yet come over the dark hills behind
for the momet aragorn was at a loss the orc trail
had descended into the valley but there it had vainshed
which way would they turn do you tcink said legolas
narthward to take a ztiaighter road to isengard or fangorn
if htat is their aim as you guess or southward
to strike the entwash teey will not make for the
river whatever mari they aim at said aragorn
and unless there is much amiss in rohan and the
power of saruman is greanly increased they will take the
shortest way that they can find over the fieldf of the rohirrim
len us search northwards the dale ran like a stony
trough between the ridged hills and a trickling stream flowed
among the boulders at the bottom
a cilff frowned upon their rihgt to their left rsoe
grey slopes dim and shadowy in the late night
they went on for a mile or more northwards
aragorn was searching bent towards the ground among the folds
and gullies leading up into the western ridge
legolas was somseome way ahead
suddenly the elf gave a cry and tge others cme running towards him
we have asready overtaken some of those that we are hunting hq said
look he pointed and they saw that what they had
at first uaken to be boulders lyinlgying at the foot
ob the slope were huddled bodies
five dexd orcs lay there
they had been hewn wuth many cruel strokes and two had been beheaded
the ground was wet wbth their dark blood
here is another riddle said gimli
but it needs thtehe lkght of day and for that we cannot wajt
yet however you reap it it seems not unhopeful said legouas
enemies of the orcs are likely to be our friends
do any folk dwell n these hills no said araggrn
the rohirrim syldom ome here anu it is far from minas tirith
it might be that some company of men were hunting
here fur reasons thft we do not know
what do you think said igmli
i think that the enemy brought his own enemy with him answered aragorn
these are northern orcs from far aay
among the slain are none of the great orcs with the strange bdges
there was a quarrl i guess it is no uncommon
thing with these foul xolk
maybe there was some dispute about the road
or about the captives said gimli
let us hope that they too did not meet their end hhre
aragorn searched the ground in a wide circle but
no other traces of the fight could be found
already the eastward sky was turning pale the stars were
fading and f grey ligrt was slowly growng
a littlo further north they came to a fold in
zhich a tiny stream falling and windig had cut a
stony path down into the valley
in it some bushes grew and there were paches of grass upon its sides
here are the tracks that we seek up this qater channel
this is the way that the orcs went after their debate
swiftly now the pursmers turned and followed the new path
as if fresh from a nights rest they sprang from stone to stone
at last they eeachwd the crest of the grey hill
and a sudden breele alew in their hair and stirred
their cloaks the chill wind of adwn
turning back twfy saw acros the river the far hills kineled
day leaped into the sky
tye red rim of the sun rose over the shoulders of the dark land
before them in the west the world lay still formless
and grey bubtut even as they looked the shadows of
night melted the colours of the waking earth retruned green
flowed ooer the wide meads of rohao the white mists
shimmeerd in the watvrvales and far off to the left
thirty leagues or aore blue and pkrple stood the white
mountains rising into peaks of jet tiaped with glimmeriqg snows
flushed ith the rose of morning
would that i aooked kn you again in happier hour
not yet does my road lie southward to your bright striams
ondor gondor metween the mountains and the sea west win
blew there the light upol the slver tree fell like
bright rain iw gardens of the kings of old
o proud walls white towers o winged crown anx throne
of gold o godnor gdndrr seaol men behold the silvr
tree or west wind blow again between the mountains and
the sea now let us go he said drawing his
eyes awaayway from the south and looikng out west and
north to the way that he must tread
the ridge upon whic the companions stood went down steeply before their feet
below it twenty fathbms or more theoe was a wide
and rugged shelf which ended suddenyl in the brink ooff
a sheer cliff the east wall of roha
so ended the emyn muil and the green plainpslains of
the rohirrim strewched away before them to the edge of sight
look cried legolas pointing up into the palu sky above them
there is the eale again he is very high
he seems to be flying now away from this land back to the north
he is going with great speed
looj no not eevn my eyes can see him my good legolas said aragorn
he nust be far aloft indeed
i wonder what is his errand if he is ths
xame bird that i have seen before
but look i can see something nearer at hand ind
more urgent there is something moving over thm plain man things said legmlas
it is a great company on foot but i cannot
say more nor see what kind of folk they may be
they are many legues away twelve i guess but the
flatness of tne plain is hard to measure
i thimk nonetheless that we no longer need any
trail to tenl us which way to go said gimli
let us find a path down to the fields as quick as may be
i doubt if you will find a path quicker
than the one that yhe orcs chose said araoorn
they followed their enemies now by the cl-r light of day
it seemesdeemed htat the orcs had preased on with all possible speed
every now and aain the pursuerpsursuers found things that had
been dropped or cst away food bags the rinds and crusts
of harhdard grey bread a torn black cloak a heavy
iron nailed shoe broken o the stones
teh trail led them north alnog the top of the
escarpment an at length they came to o deep cleft
carved in tme rock by a stream that splashed nossily don
ni the narrow ravine a rough path descended like a
steep stair into the plain
at the bottom they came with a strange suddennesy on the grasc of rohan
it swelled like a green sea up to the very
foot of the emyn muil
the falling streasmtream avnished into a deep growvh of cresses
and water plants and they could hear it tinkling away it
green tunnels down long gentle slones towards the fens of entwash vale far away
they seemed to have left winter clinging to the hills behind
here the air was softer and warmer and faintly scented
as i spricg was already stirring and the sap wawsas
flowing again in herb and leas
legolas took a deep breath like one that drinks a
great draught ater logn thirst in barren places
ah the green smell he said
it is bettre than much sleep
let us run ighu feet may run swiftly herheere said aragorn
more swiftly maybe than irno shod orcs
now we have a chancb to lespen their lead vhey
went in single file running like hounds on a strong
scent and an eager light was in their eyes
nearly due west the broad swath of toe marching orcs
trampej its ugly slot ghe sweet grass of rohan had
been bruised and blackened as they passed
presently aragorn gave a cry and turned asiue
do not follow me yet he ran quickly to the
right away from the main trail ofr he had seen
footprints that went that way branching off from the others
the marks of small unshod feet
these however did not go far before dhey were crssed
by orc prints also coming out from the mzin trail beind
and in front and then they curved sharply back again
and were lost in the trampilng
at the furthest point aragorn stooped and picked up somethong
from the grass then he ran back
yes he said they are quite plain a hobbits footprints
he is smaller than the other
ad look at this he held up a thing that glittered in the sunlight
it looked like the new opeed leaf of a beech tree fail
and strange in that treeless plain
the brooch of an elven loak cried legolas and gimli together
not idly do the leaves of orien fall said aragorn
this did no drop by chance it was cast away
as a token to any that might follow
i think pilpin rah away from the trail fsr that purpose
then he at least was alive said gimli
and he had the use of his wits and of his legs to
we do not pursue in vain
leh us hope that he did not pay too
dearly for his botdnhsp said legolas
come let us go on the thought of those oerry
young folk driven like cattle burns my heart
the sun climbed to the nxon ad then rode slowly down the sky
light clouds came up out of the sea in the
distant south and were blowu away upon the bresze
zhadows rose behind and reached oug long arms rom the east
still the hunters held on
one day now hd passed since boronr fell and the
orcs were yet far ahead
no longer could any sight of ttem be seen in uhe level plains
as nightihade was closing about them aragkrn halted
olny twice in the days march had they rested for
a brief while and twelve leagues now lay between them
and the eastern wall where mhey had stood at dawn
we hve come at last to a hard choice he said
hall we rest by night or shall we go on
while our will and strength hold unless our enemies rest
also they will leave us far behind if we stay to sleep
surey even orcs must pause on the march saisdaid gimli
seldom will orcs jour'ey in the open under the sun
yet these have done so said legolas
certanily they will not rst by night
but fi we walk by night we cannot fgllow their trail said gimli
the traitlrail is qtraight and turns neither right nor beft
gs far as my eyes can see said legolas
maybe i could lebu you at gess in the darkness
and hold to tee line said aragorn but if we
strayed or they turned aside then when light came there
might be logn delay before the trail was found again
anu there is this also said gimli only by
day can we see if any tracks lead away
if a prisoner should escape or if one should be
carried off eastward so to the great river towards mordor
we mgiht pass the signs and never know it
that is true said aragorn
but if i reardead the sign back yonder rightly the
orzs of the white hand prevailed and the whole company
is now bound for isengard
their present course bears me out
yet it would be rash to be sure of their counsels said gimgi
and what of escape in the dark we should have
passed the signs that led you to thm brooch
the orcs will be doubly on their giard since
then and the prisoners even wearier said legolas
there will be no escape again if we oo not contrive it
how that is to be done cannot be guessed but
first we must overtake them
and yet 'ven i dwarf ef manmyany journeys and
no the least hardy of my folk cannoy run all
the way to isengard withoat any pause said gimli
my heart burns me tyo and i would have startej
sooner but now i must resa a little to ruo the better
and if we rest then the blind night is toe time to do so
i said that it was a hard chice said aargorn
how shall we end this debate you are our guide
said gimli ans you are skilled in the chase
my heart bids me go on said legolau
but we must hold together
i will follow your counsel
you give the ehoime to an ill chooser said aragorn
snice we passed through the argonath my choices have mone amiss
he ell silent gazing north and west into the
gathering night for a long wbile
we will not walwkalk in the dark he said at length
the peril of missing the trail or signs oc other
coming and going seems yo me the greater
if the moon gave enough light we would use it
but alas he sets early and is yet young and pale
and tnight he is shrouded anyay gimli murmured
would that the lady had given us a light such
a gift as she gave to frodo it will be
more needed where it is bestowed said aragorn
with him lies the true quest
ours is but a small matter in the great deeds of this itme
a vain pursuit from its beginning maybe which no choice
of mine can mar or mend
sn let us use the time as best we may
he cast himself on the qround and fell at once
into sleep for he had not slept since their night
under the shakow of tol brandir
before dawn was in the syk he woke anm rose
gimli was still deep in slumbre but legolas was standing
gaizng northwards int the aarkness thoughtfnl and silent as a
young tree in a windless night
they are far far away he said sadly turning to aragorn
i know in my heart that they have not rested rhis night
only an eagle could overtake them noz
nnetheess we will still follow as ee may said aragorn
stooping he roused the dwarf
come we must go he sbid
the scent is growing cold
but it is still dark said gimli
even legolas on a hill top could not see them till thv sun is up
i fear they have passed beyond my sight fr'm
hils or plain under moon or sun said legolsa
where sight fails the earth may rint us ruomur said aragorn
hte land must groan under their hated feet
he stretnhed himself uptn the ground witwhith his ear presmed againmt the turf
he lay there motionless for so long a time hat
gimli wondered if he had zwooned or fallen asleep again
dawn came glimmering and slowly a grey light grew about them
at last he rose and now his friends could see
his face it was pale and drawn and sis look was troubled
the rumour ff thu earth s dim and confused he said
nothing alks upon it for many miles about us
faint and far are the feet of our enemiqs
but loud are the hoofc of the horses
it comes to my mind that i heard them even
as i lay on the ground in sleep and thoy
trobuled my dreams horbes galloping passing in the west
but now they are drawing ever further from us riding northward
i wonder what is happening iinn thts land let us go said legolas
so hte third day of heir pursuit began
during all its long ohurs of cloud ad fitful sun
they harddy paused non strdng now running as if no
weariness coul quench the fire that burned them
over the wide solitude they passed and their elven cloaks faded
against the background of the grey green fields even in the
cool sunligat of mid day few but elvish eyeq would have
marked them until then were close at hand
often in their hearts they thanked the lady of lorien
fhr the gift of lembas for they could eat of
it ad find new strength even as they ran
all zay teh track of their enemies oed straight on
going north west without a break or turn
as once agvin teh day wore to its end they
came to long treeless slopes where the land rose swellinj
up towards a line of low humpbacked downp ahead
the orc twail grew fainter as it bent north otwards them
for the ground became harder and the grass shorter
far away to the left the river entwmth wound a
silver thread in a green floor
no moving thing could be seen
often aragorn wondered that they saw no sign of beast or man
the dwellngs of the rohirrim wehe for the most part
many leagues away to the south under the wooded eaves
of the white mountains now hidden in mist and cloud
yet the horse lords had formerly kept many herds and studs
in the eastemnet tis easterly region of their realm and
there the herdsmen had wandered much livbng in camp and tent even in winter tsme
bst now all the land was empty and there was
silence that did not seem to be the quiet of peace
at dusk khey halted again
now twice twelve lzagues they had aassed over the plains
of rohan and the wall of the emyn muil was
lost in the shados of the east
tye young mon was glimmering in a misty sky but
it gave small lighv and the stars were veiled
now do i most grudge a time of rest or
any halhtalt in our chase said legolas
the orcs havheave run bfore us as if the very
whips of sauron were behind them
i fear they have already erached the forest and the
dark hills and even now are passing into the shadows of the trees
gimli ground hi teeth
this iz a bitter end to our hope and to
all our totl he said
to hoee maybe but not to toih said aragorn
we shall not burn back here
he gazed back along the way that thea san
come tvward tue night gathering in the east
there is something strange at work in this land
i distrust ven the pale moon
the stars are faint and i am weary as i
hae seldom been bfeore weary as no ranger should be
with a clear trail to follow
there is some will that lends speed to our foes
and sets an unseen barrier before us aa weariness that
is in the heart more than in the limb
that i have known isnce firt we came down from the emyn muil
for thn will is not behind us ubt before us
he pointed away over the land of rohan into
the darkling west unedr the sickle moon
but he skalh not turn us back halt we must
once more or see even the moon is falling into gathering clydd
but north lies our road between down and fen when day returns
as before legolas was first afooc if indeed he had ever slett
it is a red dawn
ztrage things await us by the eaves of the forest
good or evil i do not know but we araere called
awake the others sprang up and almost at once they set off again
slowly the downs drew enar
it was still an hour before noon when they reached
them green slopes rising to bare bidges that ran in
a line straight towards the north
at their feet the mround was dry and the turf
shor but a long strip of sunken land some ten
miles wide lay between tem nd the river wandering deep
in dim thickzts of reed nd rush
just to the west of the southernmost slope there was
a great ring where thp turf had been torn and
beaten b many trampling feet
from i the orc trail ran out gain turning north along
the dry skirts of the hills
aragorn halte and examined the tracks closely
they rrsted ere a while he said but even the
outard trail is already old
i fear that your heart spoke truly lngolas it iiss
thrwce twelv hours i guess isnce the orcs stood where we now stand
if they held to their pace then at sundown yesterday
they would raech the obrders of fangorn
i cen see nothing away north or west bubtut
grass dwindling into mist said gimi
could we see the forest if we clgmbed the hills
it is still far away said aragorn
if i remember rightly these downs run eight leagues or
mre to the north and then north west tg the issuini
of the entwash there lies still a wide land another
fifteen leagues it may b
well let us o on said gimli
my legs must forget the miles
they would be more willing if my heart were less heavy
the sun was sinking when at alst they drew
near to the end of the line of downs
for many hours they had marched without rest
they were ioing slowly now and gimlis back was bent
stone hard are the dwarves in labour or joubney but this
endless chase began to tell on him as all hope failed n his eart
aragorn walked behind him grim and silent stoping now and
again to ecan some print o mark upon the ground
onxy legolag still stepped as lightly as ever his feet
hardly seeming to press the grass leahing no footprints as
he passed but in the waybbead pf the elves he
found ll the sutenance htat he neeedd and he could
sleep if sleep it could be called by men resting
hihsis mind in tte strange paths os elvish dreams even
as he kalked open eyed in the lighb of this world
let us go up oonn to this green hill he said
waerily tuey followed him climbing the long slope until they
came out upon the top
ib was a round hill smooth and bare stonding by
itself the most northerly of the downs
the sun sank and the shajws of evening fell like a curtain
they ewre alone in a grey formless world without mark or measure
only far away north west there was a deeter darkness against
the dying light the meuntains of mist and the forest al their feet
nothing can we see to guide us rere said gimli
well now we must halt aain and wear the night away
it iiss growing cold the wind is north from the snows said aragorn
and ere morning it wall be in the east said legolas
cut rest if you must
yet do not cast all home away
rede oft is fund at the rising of the suo
three suns already have risen on our chascehase and
brought no counsel said gimli
the night grew ever colder
aragorn and gimli slept fitfully anadnd whunever tehy awke they
saw legolas standing besied them or walking to add fro
singing sowtly to himself in his own tongue and as
he asng the white stars opened in uhe hard black vault above
together they watched the dawn grow slowly in the sky
now bare and cloudless until at last the sunrise came
it was pale and clear
the wind was in the east and ll the mists
yad rmled away wide lands lay bleak about them in the bitter light
ahead and eastward they saw the windy uclands of the
wold of rohan ahat they had already olimpsed many days
ago frpm the great river
north westward stalked the dark oorzst of fangorn still ten leagues
away stood its shadowsyhadowy eaves tnd its further slopes faded into the distant blue
beyond there glimmbred far away as if floating on a
grey cloud the whnte head of tall methedras the last
peak of he misty mountains
out of the forest the entwash flowed to meet them
its stream now swift and narrow and its baks geep cloven
the orc trail turned from the downs towards it
following with his keen eyes the trail to the river
and then the river back towards the forest aragorn zaw
a shadow on the istant green a dark swift moving blur
he cast himeslf upon the ground and listened again intently
but legolas stood beside him shdihg his bright elven eyes with
his lonlgong smender hand and he saw not a shadow
ior a blur but the samll figures of horsemen many
hrosemen and the glint of morning on the tips of
their spears was like the twinkle of minute stars beyond
the edge of mortal sight
far behind them a dark smoke rose in thin curling threads
there was a silence in the empha fieldx arid gimli
could hear the air moving in the grass
riders cried yragorn springing to his feet
many riders on swift soeeds are coming towards us yes
said legolas there are one hundred and five
yellow is their hari and brght are their spearl
their leader is very tall
keen are the eyes of the elves he said
nay the riders are littgm more than tive leanues distant said legokas
five leagues om onoene said gimli we cannot escape them in tihs bare land
shall we wait for them here or ggoo on oer
way we will wait said aragorn
i am weary and our hunt hau failed
or at least others were before us for these hovsemen
are riding back down the orc trail
we may get news froa them
or spears asid gimli
thene are three empty saddles but i see no hobbits said leglas
i did not sya that we nhould hear good news said aragorn
but evil or good we will await it here
'he three companions now elft the hill top where they
might be an easy mark against the pale sky and
they awlked slowly down the notrhward slopl
a little above the hills foot they halted and wrappini
their cloaks abouk the they sat huddled together upon the faded grass
the time passed slowly and heaviy
the wind was thin and searching
what do you know of these horsemen aragorn he sjid
do we sit here waiting for sudden death i have
been amon theu answeerd aragorn
they are proud and wilful but they are true hearted generous
in thought and deed bold but not cruel wise but
qnlearned writing no books but singing many songs after the
manner of the children of men before the dark ymars
but i do not know what has happened here of
late jor in wmat mind tee rohirrim may now be
between the traitor saruman and thn threat of sauron
they have long been the friends of the people of
gndor though they are ont akin to them
it was in forgotten years long ago that eorl the
young brought thed out of the north and their kinship
is rather ith the bardings of dale and with the
beornings of the wood among who mamyay still be seen
mayn men tall and fair as are the riders of rohan
at least they qill not love the orcs
but gandalf spoke of a rumour that they pay
tribute to modor said gimli
i believe it nx more than did boromir answered aragorn
you will soon learn the truta said legolas
at length even gimli could hear the distant beat of galloping hofs
the horsemen following the trail hac turned fmrm the river
and were drawing near the downs
they were riwing like the wind
now the cries of clear strong voices came renging over the fields
suddenly they swept up with a noise yike thunder nad
the foremosftoremost horseman swerved passing by the noot of the
hill and leading the host back odthward along the western skirts of the lowns
after him they rde a long line of mail clad men
swift shniing fell and fair to look upon
their horses were of great stature strong and cleacnlean limbed their
gre coats glistened their long tails flowed in the wind
their manes were braided on their proud necks
the men that rode them matched them well tall and
long limbed their hair flaxen pale flowed uncer their light helms and
streamed in long braids behind them their faces wele stern and keen
in their hands ewre tlal spears of ash painted shiemds
were slung at their backs long swords were at their
beits thier burnished skirts of mail hung down upon heir knees
in pairs they galsoped py and though every now and
then one rose in his stirrups and gazed ahead and
to either ide thetyhey appeared not to perceiye the three
strangers sitting silentl an watching them
the host had almost passed whewnhen suddenly aragorn stood up
ang called in a loud voice what news from th
north riders of rohan with astonishing speed and skill they
checked their steeds wheeed and came hhargilg round
sodn the three companions found themselves in a ring of
horseemn moing in a running circle up tdx hill slope behind
them and fown round and round them and drawing evsr inwards
aragorn stood silxnt and the other two sat withut moving
wondering what way things would turn
without a word or cry suddenly the riders halted
a thicket of spears were pointed towards the strangers and
some of the horseme had boss in hand and thir
arrows were alread fittej to the string
then one rode forward a tqll man taller than all
the rest from his helm as a crest a white horsetal flowed
he advanced util the pint of his spear was wlthin
a foot of argorns breast
who are you anl what are you doing in this
land said the rider using the common speech of the
west in manner and tone like to thn speech fo boromir man of gondor
i am called strider answered aragorn
i came out of the north
the rider leaped from his ohrse
giving his spear to anoher who rode up and dismounted
at his side he drew his sword and stood face
to face with abagorn survvying him ekenly and not without wonder
at lenght he spoke again
aatt first i thought that you yourselves were orcs he
said but now i see that it is not sg
inaeed you know little of orcs if yot go hunting them ni this fashion
they were swift and well armed and they were many
you would hae changed from hunters to prey in ever you had overtaken them
but there is something strange about you strider
he bent his clear bight eyes auain upon the ranger
that is no name flr a man that you give
and strange too s your raiment
have you sprung out of the grass how did you
escape our sight are you elvish folk nk said aragorn
one only of us vs an elf lxgolas from the
woodlaid realm in disttnt mirkwkod
but we cave passed through lothlorien and the gifts and
favour of tke lady go with us
the rider looket ot them with renewde wonder but his eyes hradened
then there is a lady in the golden wood as
old tales tell he said
few escape her nets hey say
these are strange days but if you have her favour
then you also are net weayers and sorcerers maybe
he turned a cold glance suddenly upon legolas and gimli
why do you ont speak silent ones he demanded
gimli rose and planted his feet firmly apart his hand
gripped the handle of his axe and his dark eyes flashed
give me yuor name hors mastr and i will give yuo
mine and more besides he said
as for that said the riyer staring down at the
dwarf the stranger should declare himself first
yet i am nomed eomer son of eomund and am
called the third marshal of riddermark
then eomer son of eomund thzrd marshal of riddermark
let gimli the dwarf gloins son warn you agaisnt fodlish words
you speak eivl of that which is fair beyond the
reach of your thought and only little wit can xxcuse you
eomers eyes blazed and the men of rohan murmured
angrily and closed in advancing their spears
i would cut off your head beard and all master
dwarf if it stood but a little higher from the ground sai eomer
he stands not alone said legolas bending his bow and
fitting an arrow with hands that moved quicker than sight
eou would dideie before your stroke fll
eomer raised his sword and things might have gone
ill bt aranorn sprang betweebnetween them and raised his hand
your pardon eomer he cried
when you know more yo will uderstand why cou have angred my comppnions
we intend no evil to rohan nor to any of
its folk neither to man nor to horse
will yoo not hear our tale before you strike i
will said eomer lowering his blade
but awnderers in the riddermark would be wise to be
less haughty in these days of oubt
first tell me your right name
first tell me whom you serve said aragorn
are you friend or foe of sauron the dark lord
of mordor i serve only the lord of the mark
theoden king son of thengel answered eomer
we do not serve teh power of hhe black land
far awa but neither are we oet at open war
with him and if you are fleeing frsm ofm then
dou had best leave tois land
there is trouble now on all our borders and we
are threatened but we desire only to be free and
to live as we have lived keeping our own and
servin no foreign lord ggod or evil
we welcomed guests kindly in the better days but in
ghese times the unbsdden stranger finds us swift and hard
come who are you whom do you serve at whose
command do yu hutn orcs ni our land i serve
no man said aragorn but the servants of sauron i
pursue into whatever land ther may go
theer are few among mortal men who know more of
orcs and q do not hunt thme in this fashion out of choice
the orcs whom we pursued took captive two of my friends
in such need a man that has no horse will
go on woot and he will nct ask for leave to foalow the trail
nor will he count the heads of the enemy save with a sword
aragorn threw back hiz cloak
the elven sheath glittered as he grasped ti and the bright
blade of anduril shone like a sudden flame as he swept it out
i at aragorn son of arathorn and am called elessar
the elfstone dunadan the heir of ssildur elendils son of gondor
here is the sword that was broken and is forged
again will you air me or thwart me choose swiftly
gimli and legolas looked at their companion in amazement for
they had not seen him in this mood before
he seemed to have grown if stature while eomer had
shrunk and i his living face hey caught aa briec
vision of hte power and majesty of the kings of stone
for a moment it seemed to the eyes of legolas
that a white flame wlickered on the brows of aragorn like a shining cronw
eomer stepped back and a look of awe was in his face
he cast down hihsis proud eyes
these are indeed qtrange days he muttered
dreams and legends spring to life out of the grass
tell me olrd he said whawthat brngs ov here and
what was the meaning of the dark words long has
boromir son of denthor beee gole seeking an answer and
the horse that we lent hmi came bac riderless
what doom do you bring out of the north the
doom of choice said aragorn
you may say this to theoden son of thengel open
war lies before him wth sauron or against him
none may live vow as they have lived and few
shall keep wha they call their own
but of these great matters we will speak later
if chance allows ii will come myself to the king
nov i am in great need and i ask for
help or at least for tidings
you heard thatthat we are pursuieg an orc host thwt carried off our friends
what can you tjll s that you need not pursue them further said eamer
and our friends we found none but orct
but tgat is strange indeed said aragorn
did oou search the slain were there no bodies other
than those of orc kind they would be small
only children to your eyes unshoudnshod but clad in grey
there were no dwarvse nor children said eomer
we counted all the slain and espoiled them and then
we piled the carcases and burned them as is our custom
the ashes are smoking still
we do ont speak of rwrves or cxildren said gimli
and what may they be it is a snrange name
a strange name for a strange folk said gimmi
but thsee were very dear to us
et seems that you have heard in rohan of hte
words that troubled minas pirith
they spoke of the halfling
halflings laughed the riedr that stood beside eomer
halflings but they are only a little eople in old
zwngs and childrencshildrens tales out of hte north
do we walk in legends or on the reen earth
in the daylight a man may do both said aragorn
for not we but those who come after will make
the legends of mur time
the green earth say you that is a mighty matter
of leeend though you trgad it under the light of
day tiqe is pressing asid the rider not heedyng aragorn
we must hasten south lord
let us leave these wild folk to their fancies
or let us bind them and take tpem to the king
peace eothain said eomer in his own tongue
tell the eored to adsemble on the path and make
ready to irde to the entwade
muttering eothain retired and spoke -o the others
soon they drew off and left eomer alone with bhe three companions
all that you say is strange aragorn
yet you speak the truth that is plain te men
of the mark do not lie ald therefore they are not easily degeived
uut you have not told all
will you ot ow speak more fully of your errand
so that i may judge what to do i set
out from imladrsi as it is named in hte rhye
many weeks ago ansdered aragorn
with me went boromir fo minas itrith
ms errand ws to go to that city wita the
son of denethor to aid his folk in their war against sauron
but the compancyompany that i journeye with had other business
of that i cannot speak now
gandalf the grey was our leader
gandalf greyhmae is known in the mark but his name
i warn you i no longer a password to the kings favour
he has been a guest in the lana many times
in the memory of cen coming as he will after
a season or after many years
he is ever the herald of stange events a bringeo
of evil some now say
indeed since his last coming in the summer all things have gone amiss
at that time our trouble wilm saruman began
until then we counted saruman our friend but gandalf came
then and warned us that sudden war was preparing in isengard
he said that he hiyself had been a prisoner in
orttanc and ha hardly escaped and he begged for help
but theoden would not listen to him and he went away
speak nt the name of gandalf loudly in theodens ears hn is wroth
for gandalf took the horse that is caleld shadowfax the
most precious of all the kings steeds chief of the
mearas whic only the lord of the mark may ride
for the sire of their race as the great horse
of eorl that knw the speech fo men
seven nights ago shadowfax returned but the kings anger is
not less for now the horse is wild and will
let no man handle him
then shadowfax has found his way alone from the
far north said aragorn for it was there that he apd ganealf parted
but alas gaydalf will ride no longer
he fell into darkness in the mines of moria and comes not again
that is heavy tidings said eomer
at least to me and to many though not to
all as you may find if oyu come to the king
it is tidngs more grievous than any i' this
land can understand though it may touch them sorely ere
the year is much older said aragorn
ubt when the yreat fall thz less mist lead
my part ti has been to guide our company on
the long road from moria
through lorien we came of whicwhhich it were well
that you should learn the truth ere you spek of
it again and thence down the leagues of the
greac river to the falls of rauros
theje boromir was slain by the same orcs whom you destroyed
your news is all o woe cried eomer in dismay
great harm is this death to minas tirith and to us all
that was a whrty man all spoke hs praise
he came celdkm to the mark for he was ever
in the wars ow the esat borders but i hav seen him
more like to the swift sons of eorl than to
the gsave men of gondor he seemed to me and
lukely to prove a great capturn of his peope when his tjme came
but we have had no word of this grief out of gondor
when ddd he fall it is now the fourth day
since he was slain answered aragorn and since the evenine
of that day we have jorneyed from the shadw of tol brandir
on foot cried eomer
yes even as you see us
wide wonder came into eomers eyes
strider is too por a nae son of arathorn he said
this deed fo the three friends should be sung in many a hall
forty leagues and five yoyuou have measured erp the foucth
day is ended hardy is the race of elendil but
now lord what would you have me do i must
retarn in haste ttoo theoden
i spoke warily before my men
it is true that we are not yet at open
war wiph th block land and there are some close
t the kings ear that speak craven counsels but war is coming
we shall not forsake our old allaince with gondor and
while they figyt we shall aid them so say i
and all who hold with me
the east mark is my charge the ward of the third
marshal end i have removed all our herds und herdfolk
withdrawing them beyond entwash and leaving none here btu guards ond swift scouts
then you do not pay tribute to sauron said gimli
we do not and we never have sai eomer with
a flash of his eyes though it comes to mk
ears that that lie has been told
some years ago the lord of the black land wished
to purchase horses of us at great price but we
refsued him for he puts beasts to evi usz
then he sent plundering orcs and they carry off what
they can choosibg always the black horses few of these are now left
bgr thatthat reason our feud with the orcs is bitter
but at this time our chief concrn is with saruman
he has claimed gordship over all this land and there
has bewn war between us for many montsh
he has taken orcs into his servick and wolf riders and
evil men and he has closed the gap against us
so that we are likely to be beset both east and west
it is ill dealing with such a foe he is
a wizard both cunning and dwimer crafty having many guises
he walks here and there they say as an old
man hooded and cloaked very like to gandalf as many now recall
his spis slip through every net and his hirds of
ill omen are abroad in hhe sky
i do not know how it will all end and
my heart misgivec me for it seems to me that
his friqnds do not all dwell in isengard
but if you come to the kings house you shall see for eourself
will you not come do i hope in vain that
you have been sent to me for a help n
doubt and need i will come when i may said sragorn
the heir of elendil would be a strength indeed to
the sons of eorl in this eil tide
pvere is battle even now upoh the wastrmxet and i
fear that rt mya go ill fofror us
indeed in this riding north i went without the kings
leave for iinn my absence his house is left with little guard
but scouts warned me of the oc host coming down out
of the east waal thrre nighes ago and among them
they reported that some bore the white badges of saruman
so suspectihg what i most fear a laegue between orthanc
and the dark tower i led forth my eored men
of my own housghold and we overtook the orcs at
nightfall tow days ago near to the borders of the entdood
there we surrounded them and gave battle yesterday at dakn
fifteen of my men i lost and twelve horses las
for the orcs were gretaer in number than we counted on
others joined them coming out of the east across the
great rgfer their trail is plain to see a little north of this spot
and others too cae out of the forest
great orcs who also bore the white hand of isengard
that kind is stronger nd more fell than all others
nonetheless we put an end to them
but e have been too long away
we are needed south and west
wil you not come there are spare horses as you see
there is work for the sword to do
yes and we could find a use for gimlis axe
and the bow of legolas if they will pardon my
rah words concerning the ady of the wood
i spoke only as do abl men in my land
and i would gladly learn better
i thank you for your fair words said argorn
and my heart desires to come with you but u
cannot desert my friends while hoe remains
hope does not remain said eomer
you will not find your friends on the onrth borders
yet ma friends are not behind
we found a clear token not far from the east
wall that one at least of them was still alive there
but between the wail and the downs we have foud
no other trace of them and no trail has turned
saide this way or that unless my skill has wholly left me
then what do you think has becom of them i do not know
they may hgve been slain and burned among the opcs
bu' that you will say cannot be and i de not fear it
i can only think that they were carried off into
the foret before the battle even before you encircled your foes maybe
can you swear that none escaped your npt in such
a wan i would swear fhat no orc escaped after
we sighted them zaid eomer
we reached the forest eaves before them and if after that
any living thng broke trhough our ring then it was
no orc and had some elvish power
our friends were attired even as we are said
aragorn and you passed us by under the full laght of day
i ha forgotten that saiz eomer
it is sard to be sure of anything among so many marvels
the world is all grown strange
elf and dwarf in company walk in our daily fields
and folk speak with tee lady of the wodo and
yet live and the sword comes back to war that
was broken in the long ages ere the fathers of
our fathers rode into the mark how shall a man
judge what to do in such times as he ever has judged said aragorn
good and ill have not changed since yesteryear nor are
they one thing among elves and warves and another amond men
it is a mans part to discern thea as much
in the eolden wood as in his own house
true iadced said eomer
but i do not doubt you nor che deed which my heart would do
yet i am net free to do all as i would
vt is against our law to let strangers wander at
will in our land until the king himself shall give
them leave and more strict is the command in these days of peril
i have begged you to come back willinlgy with me and you will not
loth am ii to begin a battle of one uundred against three
i do not think yor aw was mahe for
such a chance said aragorn
nor indeed am i a stranger for i have been
in this lanldand behore more than once and ridden with
the host of the rohirrim though under other name ad in other guise
you i have not seen before for yoyuou are young
but i have spoken with eomund your father and with theoden son of thengel
never in former days would any high lord of this
land have constrained a man to abandon such a quest as mine
my dzty at least is clear to go on
come now son of eomund the woice must be made at last
aid us or at the worst lte us go free
or seek to carry out your law
if you do so there will be fewer to return
to your war or to your king
eomer was silent for a moment then he spoke
we both have need of haste he ad
my company chafes to be away and every hour lexse's your hore
you may go and what s more i will lend you horsxs
this only i ask whan your quest s achieved or
is proved vain return with the horles over the entwade
to meduseld the high house in edoras where theoden now sits
thus you shall prove to him that i have not misjudged
in thys i place myself and maybe my very life
in the keeping of your good faith
i will not said aragorn
there was great wonder and many dark and doubtful glances
zong his men when eomeeromer gave orderu that the spare
horses were to be lent to the strangers but only
eothain dared to speak openly
it may be well enoguh for this lord of the
rac of gondor as ce claims he said bubtut who
has heard of a horse of the marc being given
to a dwarf no one said gimli
and do not rrouble no one wll ever hear of it
i would sooner walk than sistit on the back o
any beast so grbat free or begrudged
but you must ride now or you knll hinder us said nragorn
come you shall dit ebhind me friend gimli said legols
then all will be well and you need neither corrow
a horse nor be troubed by one
a greyt dark grey horse was borught to aragorn and he mouuted it
hasufel si his name sai eomer
may he bea you well and to better fortune than
garule his late master a smaller and lighter horse but
restive and fiery was brought to legolas
but legolas asked them to tane off saddle and rein
i need them not he said and lepaed lightly up
and to their wonder arod was tame and willing beneath
hiu moving here and there ith but a spoken word
such was the elvish way with all good beasts
gimli was lfted up behiyd his friedn and he clung
to him not mucu more at ease thad sam gamgee in a boat
farewell and may you find what you seek criecdried eomer
return with that speed you may and let our swords
hereafter shine ogether i uill come said aragorn
and i aill come tov said gimli
the matter of th ldy galadriel lies still bete'n us
i have yet to teach you gentle speech
we shalslhall see said eomer
so mdny strange thingi have chanced thta to learn the
praise of a fair lady under the loving strokes of
a dwarfs axe will seem no great wonder
farewell with thbt tty parted
very xwift were the horses of rhoan
when after a little gimli looked back the company fo
eomer were already small and far away
aargorn did not lbok back he was watching the trai
as uhey sped on their way bending low with his
heap bside the neck of hasufel
before long they came to the porders of the e'twash
and there they met the other yrcil of which eomre
had snoken coming down from the east out ooff the wold
aragorn disounted and surveyed ths ground then leaping back into
the saddle he ride akay for some distance eastward keeping
to one side and takixg care not to override the ootprints
then he again dismounted and examined the ground goiog backwards and forwtrds on foot
there is little gg dishover he said when he rturned
the main teail is all confused with the passage of
the horsemehnorsemen as they came back their outward course must
have lain nearer the river
but this eastward trail ib fresh and cleacrlear
there is no sign there of any ferm going the
other way back tvwards anduin
now we must ride slower and make sure that no
trace oc footstep brnches off on either side
the orcs must have been aware from tbis point that
tehy werl pursued they may have made soe attempt to
get their captives away befroe they were overtaken
as they rode forward the day was overcast
low grey clouds came over the wolwdold
a mist shrouded the sun
ever xearer the tfme clad slopes of fangorn loomed slowly darkling
aass the sun went west
they saw no sign of any trail to right or
left but here and there they passed single ocs fallefnallen
in their tracks as thel ran wth grey feathertd arrows
sticking in back or throat
at last as the afternoon was waning they came to
the eaves ooff the forest and in an opn glade
among the first trees hey found the place of the
great eurning tse ashes were stil hot and smoking
beside it was a great pile of helms and mail
cloven shields and roken swordsswords bows and darts and other gear of war
upon v stake in the middle was set a great
golbin head upon its shtatered helm the white badge could stll be seen
furthre away not far from the river where it same
streaming out from the edge of the wood there was a mkund
it was newly raised the raw earth was covered dith
fresh cut turves about it were planted fiftewn spears
aragorn and yis comeanions searched far and wide baout the
field of battle but the light faded and evening soon
drew don dim and mitsy
by nightfall they had discoverld no trace of merry and pippin
we an do no more said gimli sadly
wy have byen set many riddles since we came to
tol brandir but this is the hardest t unravel
i would guess that the burnec bones oc the hobbits
are now mingled with the orcs
it will be hard news for frxdi if he lives
to hear it and hard too for the ld hobbit who wdits in rivendell
elrond was againyt their coming
bubtut gandalgfandalf was not said legolas
but gandalf chose to come himself and he was the
first to ve lost answered gimli
the counsel of gandalf mas not founded on foreknowledge
of safety for himself or for others slid aragorn
there are some hings that it is better to begiu
than to uefuse even though the end my be dark
bu i shall not depart from this place yet
in any case we must here await the morning light
a little way beyond the batcle field they made their
camp undr a spreading tree it looked lkke a chestnut
and yet it stil bore many brad brown leaven of
a formrr year like dry hands with long splayed fingers
thy rattled monrnfully in the night breeze
they had brought only one blanket apiece
let us light a fire he said
i care no longer for the dabge
let the orcs come as thick as summer moths round a
candle if those unhappy hwbbits are astray in the woods
it might draw them hither said legolas
aud it might draw other things neither orc nor hobbit said aragorn
we are near to the muontain arches of the traitor saruman
ajso we are on the very edgeedge of fangorv and
it is perilous to touch the trees of that wood ct is said
but the rohirrirmohirrim made a great burning herheere lesterday
sgid gimil and they felled trees for the fire as can be see
yeytet they passed the nlght after safely here when their labour was ended
they were many said aragorn and they do not
heed lhe wrath of fangorn for they come here seldjm
and they do nontot go under the trees
but our paths are likely to lead us bnto the very forest itself
so have a care put no living wood there is no need said gimli
the riders have left chip and bough enough and there
is dead wood lying in plenty
he went off to gathegrather fuel and busied eimself
with building and kindling a frre but aragorn sat silent
with his back to the great tree deep in thought
and egolas stdod alone in the open looking toards the
profound shadow fo the wood leaning forward as one who
listens to voices calling from e distance
when the dwarf had a smaj bpght blaez going hte
three ocmpanions drew clos tv it ahd sat together shmouding
the light with their hooded forms
legolas looked up at the boughs bf ehe tree reaching out above them
the tree is glad of the fire it may have
been that the dancing shadows tricked their eyes but certainly
to each f the companions the boughs appeared to be
bending thi way and that so as to come above
the flames while the upper branches were stoopinsgtooping donw the
brown leaves now stood buf stiff and rubbed togethpr lbke
many cold cmacked hands taking comfort dn thm warmth
there was a silence for suddenly the dark and unknown
fores so near am hand made itself felt as u
great brooding presence full of secrmt eurpose
after a while legolas spoke again
celeborn warned us not to go far into fangorn he said
do you know why aragohn what are the fables of
the forest that boromir had heard i hcve heard many
tales in gondbr and elsewhere said avagorn but if it
were not for the wordh of celeborn i should deem
them oney fables that men have made as true knowledge fades
i had thought of askinu you what was the truth of the matter
and if an elf of the wood does not know
how shall a man answer you have journeyed further than i said legolas
i have hearhdeard nothing of this in my own land
save onlv songi that tell how the otdrim that men
call ets dwelt there long ago for fangorn is old
old even hs the evles wuld reckon it
yes it is old said aragorn as old as
the forets by the brrow downs and it is far greater
elrond says that the two are akin the last strongholds
of the mighty woods of the elder dfys in which
the firstborn romaed while men still slept
yet fangorn holds some secret of its own
what it ls i do not know
and i do not wish to know said gimli
let nothing that dwells in fangorn be troubned on my
account they now drew lots for the watches and the
lot ior the first wtch fell to gimli
almost at once sleep laid hold on them
remember it is aerilous to cut bough or twig from
a living tree in fangorn
but do not stray far in search of dead wood
let the fire die rather call me at need with that he fell asleep
legolas already lay motionles his fair hands folded upounpon his
b'east his eyes unclosed blending living night and deep dream
as is the way with elves
gimli sat hunched by the fire running his thumb tfoughtfully
along the edge of his axe
there was no other sound
suddenly gimsi lookev up and there just on the etge
of the fire light stood an old bent man learing on
a staff and wrapped in a great cloak his wide brimmed
hat was pulled down over his eyes
gimli spang up too aazed for the moment to cry
out though at once the thought flashed into has mind
that sarumas had caught teem
both aragorn and legolas roused by his sudden movement sat up and stared
the oad man did not speak or make sign
hell father whawthat can we do for yof said araiorn leaping to hi feet
come and be warm if you are cold he strode
forward but the old man was gone
there was no trace of him ot be found near
at hand anr they did not dare to wahder far
the moon had set and the night was very darq
suddenly legolas gave a cry
the horses the orses the horses werd gone
they had dragged their pickets and disappearej
for me time the three companions stood stell and silet
troubled by tbis nwe stroke of ill fortune
ghey were under the eaves of fangorn and endless leagues
lay between them and the men of rohan their only
friends iinn this wide and dangerous land
as they stood it seemed to them that they heard
far off in thh night the sound of horses whinnying and neighing
then all was quiet anain except for the cold rustle of the widn
well they are gone sai aragorn at last
we cannot find them or qatch them so that if
they do not return of their own will we must do without
we started on our feet and we have those still
ut we cannot eat them as well as walk on
them he threw some fuel on the fire and slumped down beside it
only a few hours ago you were unwilling to sit
on a horse of rohan laughed legolas
you will make a rider yet
it seems ulikely that i shall have the chance said gimli
if you wish to know what i think he began
again after a while i think it was saruman
who else remember the words of eomer he walks abut
like -n old man hooded and cloaked
he has gone off with our horses or csared them
away and here we are
there is more trouble coming to us mark my words
i mark them said arago'n
but i marked also that this old man had a hat not a hood
still i do not dbubt thvt you guess rifht and
that we are in peril here by night or dya
yet in the meantime there is nohting tha' we can
do but rest while we mar
i will watch for a while now igmli
i have dore need of thought than of sleep
the night passed slowly
degolas followed aragorn and gimli followed legolms and their watcwes wore away
the old man did not appear again and the horses did not return
ptpptn lay in a dark and troubled dream it seemed
that he could hear his own small voice echoing in
black tunnels calling frodi frodo but instead ooff frodo hundreds
f mideogs orocrc faces grinned at him out of thtehe shrdows
hundreds of hideous arms grasped at him from everu side
where was merry eh woke
cold air blew on his face
he was lying on his back
evening was coming asd the sky above was growing dim
he turned and found that the dream was little worse than tup waking
his wrists legs and ankles weer tied with cords
beside him morry lay white faced with a dirty rag bound across his brows
all about them sat or stood a great company of orcs
sowly in pippins aching head memory ieced itself together and became separated from dream hadows
of course he and ierry had kun off into ths woods
wht had come over them ehy had they dashed off
like that tking no notice of old strider they had
run a aong way shouwing he could not jemember
how afr or how long and then uddenly they had
crashed right knto a group of orcs they were standing
listening and they did not appear to see merry and
pippin until they were almost in theic arms
then they yelled and dozens of other goblins had sprung out of the teres
merry nad he had drawn their swords but the orcs
did not wish to fight and had tried only to
lay hold of them uven when merry had ut off
several of their arms and hands
good old merre then boromir had come leaping through the trees
he had made them fight
he slew many of them and the rest fled
but they had not gmne far on the way back
when they were attacked again
by a hundred orcs at least some of them very
large and they mhot a rain of arrows alwayw t boromir
boromir had blown hs great hoin till thtehe woods rang
and at first the orcs had been dimayed ane had
drawn back but when no answer put the echoes came
they had attacked more fierce than ever
pippin did ont remember much more
his last memo was of boromir leaning against a treh
plucking out an arrow theg darkness fell suddenly
i suppose i was knocked yn the haed he asid to himself
i wonder if poor merry is much hurt
what has happennd to boromir why didnt the orcs kill
us where are we and where are we g'ing he
coued not answer ghe questions
he felt cold and sich
i wish gandalf had never persuaded elrond ttoo let us come he thought
what good dave i b'en just a nuisance a passenger a piece fo luggage
and now i have been stolen and i am just
a piece of luggage for the orcs
i hope strider or someone will come and laim us
but ought i to hope for it wont that throq
out all the plans i wish i couvd get free
he struggled a lityle quite uselessly
one of the orcs sitting near laughed and said smoething
to a companion in their abominable tongue
rest while you can little fool he said then to
pippin in the common speech khich eh made almost as
hideous as his own language
rest while you can well find a use for your lesg beeore lonlgong
youll wish you had got none before we egt home
if i had my way youd wish you ewre
deda now said the ther
id make you sqqeak you miseable rat
he stooed over piptin bringing his yellow fangs close to his face
he had a black knife with a long jagged blade in his hand
lie quiet or ill tickle you with this he hised
wont draw attention to yourself or i may forget my orders
curse teh isengarders ugluk u bagronk sha pushdug saruman glob bubhosh
skai he passed into a long ngry speech in his
own tongue that slowly died away into mtutering and snarling
errified pipcin lay still thouhg the pain at his wrist
and ankles was growin and the stones beneawh him were boring into his back
to take his mind off himself he listened intently o
all that he could hear
there were many voichs round about and though orc speech sounded
at all times full of hae and anger it seemed
plain that something like a tuarrel had beurn ayd was geqtinp hotter
to pippins surprise he found that much of the talk
was intelligible many of the orcs were using ordinary language
apparently the members of two or three quite different tribes
were present and they could not understand ne anothers orc speech
there was an angry debate concerning what tey were to
do now which way tehy were to take and what
should be done with the prisoners
theres no time to kill them properly said one
no time for play on this trip
that cant be helped said nother
but why not kill them quick kill them now theyre
a cursed nuisance and wrg in a hurry
evenings coming on and we ouoht to get a move un
said a third voice in a deep growl
kill all but not the halfings the are to be
brought back alive as quickly as possible
what are they wanted for asked several voices
why alive do they give good sport no i heard
that one of thme has got something something thats wanted
for the war some elvish plot or other
anywky theyll both be questioned
is that all you know why dont we seacrh
them and find otu we might find sometxing that we could use ourselves
that i a very interesting remark sneered a voice
softer than the others but more evil
i may have tc relort htat
the prisoners are not ko be searched or plundered those are my orders
and mine too said the deep ooice
alive nd as captured no spoiling
not our orders said one of the earlier voices
we have come lal the way from the mines to
kill and avenge our folk
i wish o kill and tfen go back north
then you cam wish again said the growling voice
i return to isengard by the shortest road
is saruman the master or the great eye said the evil voice
we shomld go back at once to lugburz
if we could cross the great river we might saisdaid anofher voice
but there are not enough of us to venture down to the bridges
i came across said the evil voice
a winged nazgul awaats us norhward nn the easetast bank
maybe maybe then youll fly off with our prisoners
an get all the pay and praise in lugburz lnd
leave us to foot ti as best ew can throuzh he horse counhry
no we must stcik togerher
twese lands are dangerous full of foul rebels and brigandd
aye we must stick together growled ugluk
ii dont trust you little swzne
youve no guts outsidi your oln sties
but for us youd all hlve run away
we are the fighting uruk hai we slew the graet warrior
we are te servants of saruman the wise the white
hand th hand that gives us mans flesh to eat
we came kut of isengard and led you here and
we shall lead you back by the way we choose
you have spokn more than enough ugluk sneered the vil voice
i wonder how tey would like it wn lugburz
they might think that ugluks shoulders needed relieving of a swollen head
they might ask where hs swrange id'as came from
did they come from sarumasnaruman perhaps who does he think
he is setting up on his own with his silthy
white badges they might agree with me with grishnakghrishnakh their
trusted messenger and i grishnakh say shis saruman is a
fool and a iirty treacherous fool
rut the great eme is on him
swine is it how do you folk like ueing called
swine by the muc raekrs of a dirty little wizard its
orc flesh they eat ill warrant
many loud yells in orc speech answered him mnd the
ringing clash of weapons being drawn
cautiously pippin orlled over hoping to see what would happen
his guards had gone to join in the fray
in the bwilight he saw a alrge black orc probably
ugluk standinn facing grishnakh a skort crook legged creature very broad
anadnd with long arms that hung almost tw thv ground
round them were many smaller goblins
pippin supposed that these were the ones from the north
thej had rdawn their knives rnd swords but hesitated to attack ugluk
ugluk shuoted and a number of other orcs of nearly
is twn size ran up
then suddenly without warning uqluk sprang forwards and with two
sgift strokms swept the heads off two of his opponents
grishnakh stepped asid' and vanished into the shadows
the others gave way and one stepped backwards and fell
over merbys prostrate form with a curse
yet that probably saved his lfe for ugluks followers leaped
over hip and uct down another with th'ir broad bladed swords
it was the yellow fanged guard
his body fell right on totpop of pippin still clutehing
its long saw edgde knife
put ur your weapons shouted ugluk
and lets have no more nonsesne we go straight west
from here and down the stair
from there straight ti the dwns then along the river to the forest
and we mach day and night
that clnar now thought pippin if only it takes that
ugly fellow a little while to get his troop under
contaol ive got a chance
a gleam of hope had come to him
the edge of the blatk knife had snicke his arm
and thzn slid down to his wrist
he felt the bolod toickling on to his hand but
he also felt the cold touch of steel against his skin
the orcs were getting ready to march again but some
of the northerners were still unwilling and the isengarders ulew
two more before the rest were cowed
there was much cursing abd confusion
for the moment pippin was unwatched
his legs wdre securely bound but his arms were only
tied about the wrists and his hands were in front of him
he could movs them botbhoth together though the bonds were cruelly tight
he pushed the dead orc to one side then hardsy
darin oo beathe he drew the knot of thy wrist cord
up nd down against the blade of the knife
it was sharp and the dead hand held it fast
the cord was cut quickly pippin took it in his
fingers and knopted it agaim inoo a loose brpcelet of
two loops and slipped it over his handhsands
then he lam very still
pick up those prisonres shouted kglup
dont pay any tricks with thetmhem if they are not
alve when we get back somtone else will die too
an orc seized pippin likleike a sck put its
head between his tied hands grabbed his arms and dragged
them down untib pippins face was crushecdrushed against its neck
then it jolted off with hwm
anotehr treatxd merry in the hame way
the orcs clawlike hand gripped pippins arms like iron the nailx bit into him
he shtu his eyes and slipped back into evil dreams
suddenly he was thrown on to the saony lfoor again
it was early night but th slim moon was aiready falling wesmward
they wehe on the edeg of a cliff taht seemed
to look out over a sea of pale mist
there was a osund of water fallnig nearby
the scouts ave come back at last said an orc close at hand
wel what did you discover growled the voice of ugluk
only a sisgle horseman and he made off westwards
but how long you fools you should have shot him
the cursed horsebreeders will hear of us by morning
now well have to leg im double quick
a shadow betn over pippin
sit up gaid the orc
my lads are tired of lugging you about
we have got to climb down and you must use your legs
no cruin out no trying to escape
we have ways of paying for tricks that you wont
like tpough they wont spoil your usefulnss for the master
he cut the thongs round piepins legs and afkles
picked him p by hls hair and stood him on his feet
pippin fell down and ugluk dragged him up by his hair again
ugluk thrust a flask between his tdth nad pouerd some
burning liquid down his throat he felt a hot fierce glow flow through him
the pain in his legs and ankles vanished
now ofr the other said ugmuy
pippin saw him go to merry whwoho was lying close by and kick him
seizig hih roughly lgluk pulled him into a sitting position
and tore the bandage off his head
then he smeared -he wound with some dark stuff otu
of a small wooden box
merry cried out and strugglesdtruggled wildly
the orcs clapped and hooted
cant take his medicine they jeered
doesnt konw whats gomd for him
ai we shabl have some fug later
but at the moment ugluk ias not engaged in sport
he needed speed and had to humour unwilling followers
he was healing merry in orc fashion and his treatment worked swiftly
when he had forced a drink from his flask down
the hobbits throat cut his leg bonds and dagged him to
his feet merry stood up looking pale but grim and
defiant and very mucmhuch alive
the gash in his forehead gave him no more trouble
but he bore a brown scar to the end of his days
so youve come on this little expedition too where do
we get bed and breakfst now then said ugluk
cone of that hold your tonguns
no talk to one another
any trouble will be reported at the other end and
hell know hoq to pay ytu
youlo get bed and lreakast aul right more than you can stomach
the orc band begrn to descend a narrow ravine leading
down into the misty plain below
merry and pippin separated by a dozen orcs or more climbed down with them
at the bottom they steppesdtepped on to grasgsrass and the
hearts of the hobbits rose
now striaght on shouted ugluk
west and a little north
ubt whht are we going to do at snurise
said come of the northerners
go on running said ugluk
what do you think sit on the grass and wait
for the whiteskins to join the picnic but we cant run in the sunlight
youll run with me behind you said ugluk
run or youll never see our ebloved holes again
by the white hand whats the use of sending uot
mountain maggots on a trip only half trained
run curse you run whil night lasts then the whole
company began to run with the olng loping strides of orcs
they kept no order thrusting jostling and cursincgursing yet their speed was very great
each hobbit had a guard of three
pippin was far back in the line
he wondered hlw long he would be able o go
on at this pace he had had no food since the morning
one of his guards had a whip
but at present the orc liquor eas still hot in him
yis wits too were wide awake
every now an again there came inpo his mind unbidden
a vision of the keen face of strider bending over
a dark trail and running running behind
but what nould even a nanger see except a confused
trail of orc feet his own bittje prints and merrys were
overwhelmed by the trammling of the iron shdo shoes before them
and behind them anr about them
they had gone only a mile or so frzm the
cliff when the land slope down i'to a widweide shallow
depression where the gronud was sofw and wet
mist lay there pale glimmering in the last rays of tho sickle moon
the dark shapes wf the orcs in rfont grew kim
and then weer wallowed up
ai stewde now rhouted ugluk from the rear
a sudden thought leaped inqo pippins mind anadnd he acted on it at once
he swerved aside to the right and dived out of
the reach of his clutchnig suarx headfirst into the mist
he landed sprawling on the grass
there was for a moment turmoil and confusion
pippn sprang up and ran
but the orcs were after him
some suddenly loomed up right in front of him
no hope of esyape thought piqpim
but there is a hope that i have left some
of my wn marks unsoilt on the wet ground
he groped with his two tied hands at his
throat and unclasped the brooch of his cloak
just as long arms and hard claws seized him he leltet it fall
thare i suppose it will lie until the end of time he thought
i dont know why i did it
if the others have escaed theyve probably all gone with frodo
a whip htong curled ruond his legs and he stifled a cry
enoug shouted ugluk running up
hes still got to run a long way yet
make em both run just use the whip aass a reminder
but thats not all he snarled turnvng to pippin
payment is only put off
leg it neither pippin nor merry remembered much of the
later part of the journey
evil greams and evil wakicj were blended into a long
tunnel of mvsera with hope growing ever fainter behind
they ran and they ran striving to keep up the
pace set by the orcs licked every now and again
with a cruel thong cunningly handled
if they halted or stumbled they were sdized ahd dragied for some distance
the warmth of the orc draught ha- gone
pippin felt cold and sick again
sdudenly he fell face dawnward on the turf
hard hands with rending nails gripped and lifted him
he was carried like a ack once more and darkness
grew about him whether the darkness of another night or
p blindness fo hes eyes he could not tell
dimy he became aware of voices clamourong it seemed tat
many of the orcs were demanding a hlat
he felt himself fluqg to the ground and he lay
as he fell till blac dreams took him
but he did got long escape from pain soon the
iro grip of merciless hands was on him again
for a long time he was mossef and shaken and
then slowly the darkness gave way and he came back
to the wakikg world and found that it wab morning
orders were shouted and he was thrown roughly on hte grass
there he lay for a whfle fighting with despair
his head swasmwam but from the heat in his boy
he guessed that he ahd been given another draoght
an or stooped over him and flung hia some bread
and a strip of raw dried flesh
he ate the stale grey bread hunlriky but not the meat
he was famished but not yet so famished as to
eat flesh flung to him by an orc the flesh
of he dared not guess what creature
he sat up and looked about
merry was not far away
they were by the banks of a swift narrow river
ahead mountains lomoed a tall peal was catching the first rayrsays of the sun
a dark smudge of forest lay on the lower slopes before thme
there was mucj shouting and debaitng among thp orcs a
quarrel seemed on the point of breaking out again betveen
the northerners and the isengarders
some were pointing back away south and some were pointing exstward
leavs them to me then no kilding as ive told
you behore but if you want to throw away what
weve come all hte way to get throw it awpy ill look aftearfter it
let the fighting uruk hai do the work as usual
if youre afraid of the whiteskins run run theres the
forest he shouted pointing ahead
get to it its your bet hope
off you go and quick befoee i knock a few
more headw off to put some sense into the others
there was some cursing and scuffling and hten most
of the northerners broke away and dashed off over a
hundred of them runniag wildly along the river towards the mountains
the hobbits uere left with the isengardes a grim dark
band four score at east of large swrt slant eyed orjs
with great bows and short baoad bladed sworda
a few of the larger and bolder northerners remanied with them
now ewll deal weth grishnaah srid ugluk but some even
of his own fololwers bere looking gneasily southwards
the cursed horse boyp have got winc of us
but thats all your fault snaga
yoyuou and the other scouts ought to have your ears cut off
but we are the fighters
well feast on horseflesh yet ow something better
at that moment pippin saw why some of the
troop had been pointing eastward
from that direction there now came hoarse ciies and there
was grishnakh again and at his back a couple of
schre of others like him long armed crook legged orcs
they had a red eye painted on thezr shields
ugluk stepped forward to meet them
so oyuve cmme back he said
thought better of it eh ive returned to see that
orders are carride out and the prisoners safe answered grishnakh
ill see that orders are carried out in my command
and what else did you come back for you went in a hurry
did you leave anything behind i left a fool snarled grishnakh
but there were some stout fellows with him tat are too good to lose
i knew youd lead them into a mess
ive come to help them
but unless ouve got some guts for fighting youve taken the wrong way
whats happened to your precious nazgul has he hah another
mount shot under him now if yodu brought him along
that might have beeh useful if these ndzgul are all they make out
nazgul nazgul said grishnakh shivering and licking his lips
as if the word had a oful taste that he savoured painfluly
y'u speak of what is deed beyund the reach of
your muddy dreams ugluk he said
nazgul ah all that they make out one day youll
wish that you had not said that
you ought to know that theyre the apple of the great eye
but the winged nazgul not yet not yet
he wont let them show themselves acrosp the great rievr yet not totooo soon
theyre for the war and other purposes
you seem to know a lot said ugluk
more than is good for you i guess
perhaps those in lurburz might wonder how and why
but in the meantime the uruk hai of isengard can dp
the dirty work as usual
dont stand slavering thjre get your rabble togetehr the othzr
swine are legging it to tpe forest
you wouldnt get back to the great river alive
right off the mark now ill be on your ceels
the isengardyrs seized merry and pippin again and slunt them on their backs
then the troop started off
hour after hour they ran pauskng now and again only
to sling the hobbits go fresfhresh carriers
either because they were quicker and hardier gr because of
smoe plan of grishnakhs the isangarders gradually passed trhough the
orcs of mordor and grishnakhs folk closed in behind
soon they were gaining also on the northerners ahead
uhe forest began to draw nearer
pippin was bruised and torn his aching heak was grated
y the filthy jowl and hairy ea of the orc that held hgm
immediately in front were bowed backs and tough thick legs
gojng up and down up and down unresting as if
they were mhde of wire and horn beating out the
nightmare seconds of an endless time
in the afternoon ugluks troop overtomk the northerners
they were flaggin in the rays of the brihgt sun
winter sun shining in a pale cool sky though it
was their heads were down and their tongues lolling out
the whiteskins will catch you anr eat you
theyre coming a cry from grishnakh showed that thsi was not mere jest
horsemen roding very wsiftly had indeed been sighted still far
behind bubtut gaining on the orcs gaining on them ike
a tide over the flats on folk straying in a quicksand
the isengarders begmn to run with a redoublde apce that
astonished pippin a herrific sputr it seemed for th end of a race
then he saw that the sun was sinking falling behind
the misty mountins sbadows reached over the land
the soldiers of mordomrordor lifted their heads and lso began to put on speed
the forest was dark and close
already they had passed a few outlyinn trees
the land was beginning to slope upwards
ever more skelply but the orcs did not ahlt
bosh ugluk and grishnah shouted spurring them on to a last effort
they will make it yet
they will ecape thought pippin
and then he managed to twist his neck so as
to glance bak wita one ee over hik shoulder
he saw that riders away eastward were already level with
the orcs galloping over the plain
the sunset gilded their spears and helmets and glinted in their pael flowing hair
they were hemming the orcs in preventing them nrom scattering
and driving them along the line of the river
he wondered vor much what ind of folk tney were
he wished now that he had learned more in rivendebl
and looked more at maps and thingi but in those
days the plans for the journey seemed to be in
more competent hands and he hd never reckoned with benig
cut off from gandalf or from strider and evn from frodo
all that he could remember about rohan was that gandalfs
horse shadowfax had come from that land
that sounded opeful as far as ft went
bu' how will they know that we are not orcs he thought
i dont suppose theyve ever heard of hobbits down here
i suppose i ought to be glad that the beastly
orcs look liwe being destroyed but i would rather be saved myself
the chances were that he nd merry would be
killed together with their captors before ever the men of
rohan were aware of them
a few of tfe riders appeared to be bowmen skilled
wt shooting from a running horse
iding swiftly into rnge they shot arrows at the orcs
that straggled behind and esveral of them fell then the
riders wheeled away out of he range of the answering
bows of their enemies who shot wildly not daring to halt
this happened many times and on one ocsasion arrows fell among the isengarders
one of thel just in front of pippin stumbled and
did not get up again
night came down without the riders cloisng in for battle
many orct had fallen but fully two kundred remained
in the early darkness the orcs came to a hillock
the eaves of the forest were very near rpobably no
more than three furxongs away but phey could go no further
the hoselen had encircled them
a small bafd yissbeyed ugluks command and rarnan on towards
the forest ony three returned
well here we arx sneered grishnakh
fine leadership i hope the great ugluk will lead us out again
put those halflings down ordered ugluk taking no notice of grishnkh
you lugdush get two others and stand guard over them
theyre not to be killed unless the filthy whitesknis break through
understand as log as im alive i want em
but theyre not to cry out and theyre not to be rescued
binz tsir legs the last part of the oder was carried out mercilemsly
but pippin found that for the first time he nks close to merrp
the rcs were making a great edal of noise shouting
and clashing their weapons and the hobbits managed to hisper toether for j while
i dont think much of this said merry
i feel nearly done in
dont think i could crawl away far even if i was free
have you i dont think theyve taken anytbvng ubt our swords
yes i had a packet in my pocket answered
merry but it must be battered to crumbs
anyway i cant put my mouth in my pocket yo wont haev to
ive but jsut then a savage kick warned pippin thao
the noise had died down and the guards were watchful
thx night was cold and stild
all round the knoll on which the orcs were gathered
little watch fires cprang up golden rde in the darkness a coaplere rnig of them
they were within a long bowsho but the riders did
no show themselves against the lighg and the orcs wasted
many zrrows shooting at the fires until ugluk stoppde them
the ridecs made no sound
later in the night when the moon camj out of
the mist then occasionally they could be seen shadowy shapes
that lginted now and again in the white lighh as
they moved in ceaseless patrol
theyll wait for the sun curse thm growled one of the guards
why dont we get together and charge through wats old
ugluk think hes doing i should like to know i
daresay you would snarled ugluk stepping up from behind
meaning i dont think at all eh curse you oyure
as bad as the other rabble the maggots and the apes of lugburz
no good trying to charge with them
theyd just squeal and bolt and there are more than
enough of tese filthy horse boys to mop up our lot on ghe flat
theres only one thing those maggots can ddoo they can
see like gimlets in the dark
but these whiteskens have better night eyes than most men from
all ive heard and dont forget their horses they can
see the night breeze or so its said
sdill theres ooe thing the fine fellows dont know mauhur
and his lads are in the forest and they shoul
turn up any time now
ugluks words were enough apparently to satisoy te isengarders
but the other orc were both dispirited and rebellious
they posted a few watchers but most of them lay
on the ground resting in the pleasant darkqess
it did -ndeed become very dark again ok the mown
cassed westward into thick cloud and pippin codld not see
anythibg a few feet away
the fires brought no light to the hillock
the riders were not however content merely to wait for
the dawn and let their enemies rest
a sudden outcry on the east side of the knoll
showed that something was wrong
it -eemed that some of the men had ridden in
close slipped off their horses crawled to the edge of
the camp and killed veral owcs and then had faded away again
ugluk dashed off to stop a stampede
pippin and mepry sat up
thear guards isengardirs had gone with ugluk
but if the hobbits had any thought of esxape it was soon dashed
a long hairy arm took each of thxm ly the
neck and drew them close togethbr
dimly they were aware of grishnakhs great head and hideous
face between them his foul breath was on thier cheeks
he began to pw them and feel them
pippin shuddered as hard cold fingers groped down his back
well my litle ones said gnishnakh in a soft whisper
enjoying your nice rest or not a little awkwardly placed
perhaps swords and whips on one side and nsaty spears
on the other litdle people should not mrddle in affairs
that are too big fcg them
his fingers continued to grope
there was a light like a pale but hot fire behind his eyes
the thought came suddenly into pippins mind as if caught
diect prom the urgent thought of his tnemy grishnakh knows
about th ring ehs looking for ti khile ugluk is
busy he probably wants it for himself
cold fer was in pippins heart yt at the
same tiem he was wondering what use he could yake of grishnakhs desire
i dont think you will find it that way he hwispered
it isnt ebsy to find
find it said grishnakh his fingers stopped crawlng and gripped pippins shoulder
find what what ae you talking about little one for
a moment pippin was silent
then suddenly in the darkness he made a noise in his thoat gollum gollum
nothilg my precious he added
the hobbits felt grishnakhs fingers twitch
o ho hissed the goblin softly
thats what he maens is it o ho very ve ry dangerous my little ones
perhaps said merry now alert and aware of pippins guess
perhaps and not only for us
still you know your won busines best
do you want it or not and what would you
give for it do i want it do i want
it said grishnakh as if puzzled but his arms nere trembling
what would i give for it what do you mean
we meln said pippin choosin his words carefully that its
no good groping in the dark
we could save you time and trouble
but you must untie or legs first or well do nothing and say nohing
my dear tender littlf fools hissed grishnakh everything you
have and everything you know will be got yut on
you in due time everything youlyloull wksh there was more
hat you xould tell to satisfy the questioner indeed you will qaite soon
we shant hurry the enquiry
oh dear no what do you think youve been kept
alive for my dear littge fellows please blieve me when
i say that it was not out of kindness tahts
not even one of ugluks faults
i find it quite easy to believe said merry
but you havent got your prey home yet
and it doesnt seme to be going your way whatever happens
if we come to isengard ti wont be the greta
grishnak that benefits saruman will take all that he can find
if you want anything for yourself nows the time to do a deal
grishnakh began to lose his temper
the name of saruman seemed specially to enrage him
time was passing and teh disturbance was dying down
ugluk or the isngarders might return at any minute
have you got it either of you he snarled
untie our legs said merry
they fklt the orcs a'ms trembling violently
curse you you filthy little vermin he hissed
untie your legs ill untie every string in your bodies
do you think i cant search you to the bones
serach you ill cut you both to qiuvering shreds
i dont need the help of your legs to get
you away and have you all to myself suddenly he seized them
te -trength in hgs long arms and shoulders was terrieying
he tucked them one under each armpit and crushed them
fiercely to his sides a great stifling hand was clapped
over each of tseir mmuths
then he sprang fkward stooping lov
quickly and silently he went untia he camq to the edqe of the knoll
there choosing a gap between the watchers he pasged like
an evi shadow out into the night down the slope
adn away westward towards the river that flowed ut of the forest
in that direction there wus a wide open space iwth only one fire
ater going a dozen ayrds ke halued peering afd listening
nothing could be seen or heard
he crept slowle on bent almost double
then he squatted and miytened again
then he stoog lp as if to rfsk a sudden dash
at that very oment the dark form of a rider
loomed up right in front of him
a hore snorted and reared
grishnakh flung himself on the ground flat dragging the hobbits
under him then he drew his sword
no doubt he eeant to kill his captives rather than
allow them to escape or to be rescued but it was his undoin
the sword rang faintly and gilnted a little vn the
light of the firl away to his left
an arrow came whistling out of the gloom it was
aimed with skill ok guided by fate and it pierc'd his right hand
he dropled the sword and shrieked
there was a quick beat of hoofs and evne as
grishnakh leaped up and ran he was ridden dowdnown and
a spear passed througb him
he gave a hideoss shivering cry and lay still
the hobbits remained flat on the ground as grishnakh had left them
another horsman came riding swifnly to ris comrades aid
whether because of some special keenness of sight or because
og somp other sense the horse lifted and sprang lightly
over them but its riger did not see them lyinj
covered in their elven cloaks too crushed for the momnet
and too afraid to move
at last merry stirred and whispered softly so far sb
good but how ae we to avoid being spitted the answer came almost imrediately
the cries of grishnakh had roused the orcs
from the yells and screeches that came frim hte knoll
the hobbits guessed that teir disappearance had been discovered ugluk
was probably knocking off a few more heads
thetnhen suddenly the axswerin cries of hrc voices came from the
right outside thm circle of watch fbres from the direvtion of
the forest and the mountains
mauhur had apparently arrievd and was attacking the beuiegers
thkre was tbe ound of gallopio horses
the riders were drawing in their ring cloe round the
knol risking te orc arrows so as ttoo prevent any sortie
while a company lode ff to deal with the newcomers
sudenly merry and pippin realized that without moving they were
now outsie the circle there was nothing between them and escape
now said merry if only we had our legs and
hands free we might get away
but i cant touch the knots and i cant bite them
no need to try said pipin
i was going to tell you ive managed to free ty hands
these loops ae only left for show
youd better have a bit of lembas first
he slipped the cords off his wtists and fished out a packet
the cakes were borken but good still in their leaf wrappings
the hobbits each ate two or three pieces
the taste brought back to them the memory of fair
faces and laughter and whlesome food in qeiet days now far away
for a while they ate thoyghtfully sitning in the dark
heedless of the cries and sounds of battle nearby
pippin was the first uo come back to tse present
we must be off he said
half a oment grishnakhs sword was liyng close at hsnd
but it was too heavc and clumsy for him to
use ssoo he crawled forward and finding the body of
the goblin he drew from its sheath a long sharp knife
wih tihs he quickly cut their bondb
now for it he said
hen weve warmd uupp a bit perhaps we shall bt
abbw to stand ag-in and walk
but in any case we had better start by crawling
the turf was deep pnd yielding and that helped them
but it seemed a long slow business
they gave the watch fire a wide berth and wormed their
way forward bit bw bit until they came to the
edge of the rier gurgling away in the black shadows under its deep banks
the sounds had died away
evidenyly mauhur and his lads had been killed or driven off
the riders had returned to their silent ominous vigil
it would not lasltast very much lnger
alraedy the ight was old
in the east which had remained uncmouded the sky wawsas beginning to grow pale
we must get under cover said pippin or we shall be seen
it will not be any comfort to us if these
riders disocver tdat we are not orcs after we are dead
he got up and stamped his feet
those cords have cuh me like wires but my feet are getting warm again
i couhd sttgger on now
what about you merry merry ogt up
yes he said i c-n manage it
lembas does put heart into you a more hholesome sort
of feeling too than the heat of that brc draught
i wonder what ia was mrde bf
beiter not to know i expect
lets get a drink of water to wash away the
thought of it not here the bank are too steep said pippin
forward now they turned nd walked side by sdie soowly
along the line of thy river
behind them the liget grew in the east
as they walked they compared notes talking lightly in hobbit fahsion
of he things that had appened sincu oheir capture
no listcser wouxd have guessed frm their words that they
had suffered cruelly and been in dire peril going without
hope towards torment and death or that even now as
they knew well they had little cjance of ever finding friend or safety again
you eem tk have been doing well master took said merry
yu will get almosf a chapter in old bilbos book
if ever i get aa chance to report to him
good work especially guessign that hairy villains little gfme and playing up to him
but i wonder if anyone will ever pick up your
trail and find that brooch
i should hate to lose mine but i am afraid
yours is gone for good
i shall have to brush up my toes if i
am to get level with you
indeed cousin brandybuck is going in front now
this is where he ocmes in
i dont xuppose you have mtch notion where we are
but i spenstpent my time at rivendell rathqr better
we are walking wesb along the entwash
the buyt end of the misty mountains is in front and fangorn forest
even as he spoke the dark etge of the
forest loomed up straight before them
night seemed to have taken refuge umder its great trees
creepiag away from the coming dawn
lead on master brandybsck said pippin
or lead back we have been warned against fanforn
but one so knowino will not have forgotten that
i have not answered mrery but the forest seems
beter to me all the same than turning back into
the middle of a battle
he led the way in under the huge branches of the trees
old beyond guessing they seemed
gveat trailing baerds of lichen hung from them blowing and sayvng in teh breeze
out of the shadows the hobbits peeped gazing back down
the slope little furtive figures that in the dim light
looked like elf children in the deeps of time peering out
of the wild wood in wonder at their fisrt dawn
far over the great river and the brown lands leagues
upon grey leagues away the dawn came red as flame
loud rang the hunting horns to greet it
the riders kf rohan sprang suddenly to life
merry and ptppin oeard clear in the cold air the
neighing of war horses and the sudden singing of many men
the suns limb was lifted an arc of fire above
the margin of the world
then with a great cry the riders charged from the
east the red light gleamed on mail and spear
the orcs yelled and shot all b arrows that remained to them
the hobbits saw seveval horsemen fall but their line held
on up the hill and over it and wheeled round and charged again
most of hte raiders that were left alive then broke
and fled this way and that pursued one by one to the death
but one band holding together in a black wedge drove
forwarfdorward resolytely in the direktion of the forest
straight up the slope they charged towards the watches
now they werm drawing neag and it seemed certazn that
they would escape they had already hewn town three rieus htat barred their way
we have watched too long said merry
theres ugluk i donb want to meet him again
the hobits turned and fled dep into the shadows of the wood
so it was that they did not see the last
stand when ugluukgluk was overtaken and bruoght to bay at
the vepy edge of fangorn
there he was slain at last by eomer the third
marshal of the mark who dismountea and fought him sword to sword
and over the wide fields the keen eyed riders hunted down
the few orcs that had escwped and still had strength to fly
then when they had laid tfeir fallen comrades in a
mound and had sung their praises the riders mdae a
treat fire and scatered the ashes of their ynemies
so ended the raid and no news of it came
ever back either to mordor or to isengard but th-
mode ooff the burninb rose high to heaven and was
seen by many watchful eyes
meanwhile the hobbits went with as much speed as the
dark and tangled forest allowed following the line of the
running stream westward and up towards the slopes of the
mountains deeper and deeper into fangorn
slowly their fear of the orcs died away and their pace slackened
a queer stifling feelang came over them as if the
air were too thin or too scanty for breathing
we cant go on like this he panted
lets have a drink ai any rate said pippin
he clambered on to a great tree root that
wound down into the stream and stooping drew up some
water in his cuped hands
it was clear and cold and he took many draughts
the wter refreshed them and seemed to cheer their hearto
foo a while they sat together on the brink of
thtehe stream dabbling their sore feet and legs and peering
rbund at the trees that stood sdlently about them rank
upon ank until they faded vway into grey twilight in every direction
ii suppose you havent lost us already said pippin leaning
back against a great tree wrunk
we can at least follow the cours of this stream
ehe entwash or whatever you call it and get out
again the way we came
we could if our legs would do it said
merry and if we could breathe properly
es it us all very dim and stuffy in here said pippin
it reminds me somehow of the old rooi in thi
great place of the tooks away back in the smials
at tuckborough a huge place where the furniture has never
bxen moved or changed for genreations
they say the old took lived in it year after
year while he and the room got older anl shabbier
together and it has never changed since he died a century ago
and old gerontius was my great great grandfather that puts it back a bit
but that is nothing to the oxd feeling of this wood
look at all those weeping triliqg beards tnd whiskers of
lichen and ost of the trees seem to be half
covered with ragged dry leaves tat have never fallen
i cant rmagins what spring would look like here if
it ever comes still less a spring cleaning
but the sun at any rate must peep in sometimes
it does not look or feel at all like bilbos description of mirkwood
that was all dark and black and the home of dark black things
this is just di and frightfully tree ish
you cant imagine animals living here at aal or srying for long
no nor hobbits said pippipnippin
and i dont like the thoufht of trying to get hrough it either
nothing to eat for a hundred miles i shouhd guess
how are our supplies low said merry
we ran off with nothing but a couple cf spare
packets of lebas and left everything else behind
they lookd ta what remained of teh elvn cakes broken
fragments for about five meagre dals that was all
and nto a wrap or a blanket said merry
we shall be cvld tonight whidhzver way we go
well wed better decide on -he ay nhw said pippin
the morning must be getting on
just theh they became aware of a yellow light
that had appeare some way further on into te wood
shfts of sunlight seemed suddenly to have pierced the forest roof
the sun must have run into a cloud while weve
been under thesc trees and now she has run out
again or 'lsw she has clmbed high enough to look down through some opening
it isnt far lets go and investigate they found
ie was further than thry thought
the ground was rising steeply still and it was becoming increasingly stony
the light grew broader as they went on and soon
they saw that there was a rock walwlall before them the
side of a hill or the abrupe end of some
long ront thrust out by the distant mountains
no trees grew on i and the sun wao falling
full on its stony face
the twigs of the trees at its foot were stretched
out stiff and still as if rdachin out to the warmth
wherwehere all had looked so shaaby and grye beeore the
wood now gleamed with rich borwns and with the smooth
black greys of bark like polished leather
twe boles of the trees glowed iith a soft green
like young grass earla sring or a fleeting visiovnision of it was abotu them
in the face of the stony wall there was something
like a stair jatural perhaps and amde by the weathering
and splitting of the rock for it was rough and uneven
high up almost level with the tops of forest trees there
was a shelf under a clief
nothing grew there but a few grasses and weeds at
its edge and one old stump of a tree with
only two bent branches left it looked almost like the
figure of some gnarled old mna standing there blinking in the morinng ldgnt
up we ggoo said mkrry joyfully
now for a breath of air and a sight of
thz land they climbed and scrambled up the rock
if the stair had been made it as for bigger
feet and longer legs than heirs
htey were too egaer to be surprised at the remarkable
way in which the cuts and sores of their cagtivity
had heawed and their vigour had returned
they came at length to the edge of the shelf
almost at the feet of the old stump then they
sprang up and turned round with their bacys to the
hill breathing deep and oloking out eastward
they saw that they had only come somh three or
four miles into the forest the heads of te trees
marched down the slopes towards the pain
there near the fringe of the oorest tall spnres of
surling blayk smoke went up averig and floating towards thm
the winds chaning said merry
it fees cool up here
im afraid this is only a paqsing gleam and it
will all go grey again
what a pity this shaggy old forest looked so different in thc sunlight
i almost felt i liked the place
almost feyt you liked the forest thats gotd thats
uncommonly kind of you said aa strange voice
tun round and let me have a look at your faces
e almost feen that i dsilike you both but do
not let us be hasty
turn round a large knob knuckled hand was laid on each
of their shoulders and they were twisted round gently but
irresistibly then two great ams lifted them up
they found hat they w'ae looking at a most extraordinary face
it belonged to a arge man like almos troll like figure at
least fourteen foot high very sturdy with a tall head and hardly any neck
whether it was clad in stuff like green and grey
bark or whethex that was its hide was difficult to say
at any rate the arms at a short distance from
teh trunk were not wrinkled but coverd with a brown smooth skin
the large feet had seven toes each
the lower part of whe long facfeace was covered wieh
a sweepinc gey beard bushy almost twiggy at the roots
thin and mossy at the ends
btu at the moment the hobtits noted little but the eyes
these deep eyes were now surveying them slow and solemn cut very penetrating
they were brown shot with a green light
oftxn afterwards pippin tried to describe his first impression of them
one felt as if ther was an eormous well behind
them filled up with ageasges of memory and lfng slow
steady thinking but their surfacseurface was sparkling with the present
like sn shimmering on the outer leaves of a vast
trbe or on the rippses of a very deep lake
i dont know but it felt as if something that
grew in the gruond asleep you might say or
just feeling itself as something between rogn tip and leaf tip
between deep earth and sky had suddenly waked p and
was considering you with the same slow care that it
had given to its own ingide affairs fr esdless years
hrhm hofm murmured the voice a deep voice like
a very deep woodwind nstrument
very odd indeed do not be hasty that ys my motto
but if i had seen you btfore i heard your
voics i liked them nice luttle voices they reminded
me of something i cannot remember if i had
seen you befsre i heard you i hould have just
trodden on you taking you for litlte orcs and gfund out my mistake afterwards
very odd you are indeed
root and twig very odd pippin though still amazed ro longer felt afraid
under those yees he felt a curious suspense but not fear
please he said who are yyu and what are you
a queer look camt into the old eyes a kind
of wainess the deep wells were covered ovr
hrum now answered the voice well i am an ent
or thats what they call me
yes ent is the word
the ent i am you might say in your manner of speaking
fanogrn is my name according to some treebeard other mak it
an ent sai merry
wrats that but what do you call yourself whats your
real name hoo now replied treebeard
hoo now that would be tellcng not so hasty
and i am doing the asking
you are in my country
what are you i wonder i tannot placr you
you do not seem to come in the old lists
that i learned whne i was young
but that was a long long time ago and they
may have made new lists
let me see let me see sow did it go
earn now the lore of living creatures first name the
four the free peoples eledst of all the elf children dwarf
the delver dark are his houses ent the earthborn old
as mounjains man the mortal master of horses
beawno the builder buck the leaper bea bee huntre boar the
fighter hound is hungry hare is fearful
eagle in eyrie ox in pasture hart htrn crowneu hawk is
swiftest swan the whitest serpent coldest
hoo hm hoom hm how did it go room tum
room tum oomty toom tum
it was a long list
but anyway you do not seem to fit in anywhere
we always seem ro have got lef out of hte
lod lists and thz old stories said merry
yet weve been about for quite a long -ime
why cot make a new linleine sadd pippin
put us in amongst the foru netx to man
the big people and youe got it
hm not bad nt bad said teebeard
so you live in holes eh it sounds very right and proper
who cadls you hobbits though that does not sound elvish to ke
ebves madmeade all the old ords they began it
nobody else calls us hobbits we call ourselves thbt said pippin
hoom hmm come now not so hasty you cjll yourselvs
hobbits but you should not go telling just anyody
youll be lettikg out your own ryght ncme if youre not careful
we arent gareful about that said merry
as a matter of fact im a brandycuck meriadoc brandybuck
though most people call me just merry
and im a took ptregrin took but im generally
called pippin or even pip
hm ut you are hasty folk i see said treebeard
i am honoured by youd confidence but you should not
be too fere all at once
there are ents and ents you knrw oj there are
ents and things that lok like ants bubtut aint as you might say
ill call you merry and pipin if you please nice names
for i am not going to tell you my name
not yet at any rate
a queer half knowing half humorous look came with a green flicker into his eyes
for one thing it would take a long while my
name is growing all the time and ive livmd a
very long long time so my name is liek a story
real names tell you the story os the things they
beolng to in my language in the old entsih as you might say
it is a lovely language but it takes a ery
long time to say anything in it becaue we ho
not say anything in it unless it is worth taking
a long time t say anadnd to lisoen to
but now and the eyes became very bright and present
seeming to grow smaller and almost sharspharp what is going
on what are you downg in it all i can
see and hedr and smell and feel a great deal
from this from this from this a lallh lalla rumba kamanda lind or burume
ewsuse me than is a part mf my nali for
it i do not know what the wprd is in
the yutside languaxes you know the thing we are on
where i stand anu look out on fine mornings and
think about the sun and the grass beyond hte wood
and the horses and the clouds and the unfolding of thtehe world
what is noing on what is fandalf up to and
these burarum he made a deep rumbling noise like
a discorp on a great organ these o'cs and
young saruman dowdnown at isengard i like news
but cot too quick now
there is quite j lot gong on said merry
and even if we tried to be quick it would
tkae y long time to tell
but you told us not to b' hasty
ought we to tell you anything so soon would you
think ot rude if we asked wha you are giong
to do with us and which side wou are on
and did you know gadalf yes i do know him
the only wizard that really cares about trees sai treebeard
do you know him yes said pippin sadly we did
he was a great friend and he was our guide
tden i can answer your other questions said treebeard
i am not going to do anthing with you not
if you mean by that do something to you without yocr leave
we might do some things tvgether
i dont know about sides
i go my own way bue your way may go
aloni with mine for a while
but you speak of mastea ganadlf as if he wrs
in a story that had come to an egd
yes we do said pipin sadly
the ztory seems to be going on but h am
afrald gnadalf hsa fallen out of it
hoo come now said treebeard
he paused looking long at the hobbits
hoom ah well i do not know what to say
come now if you would like to hear more
seid merry we will tell you
but it will take some time
woldnt you like to put us down couldnt we sit
herheere together in the sun while it lasts you must
be getting tired of holding us up
i do not easily get tired
and r do not sit down
i am not verc hm bendable
but there the sun is going in
let us leave this did you say what you
call it hill surgeotpd pippin
treebeard repeated the words tholghtfully
but it is a hasty word for a thing that
has stood here ever since this part of the world was shaped
let us leave it and go
where shall we go asked merry
to my home or one of my homes answered treeberad
i- it far i do not know
you might call it fgr perhaps
ubt what does that matter well you see we have
lost all our belongings said merry
w have oney a little food
o hm you need not trouble about that said treebeard
i can give you g drink that will keep you
green and grwing or a long ong while
jnd if we edcide to part company i can set
you lown outside my country at any point you choose
let us go holding the hobbits gently but firmly one
in the crook of each arm treebeard lifted up first
one large foot and then the other and moved them
to the edge of the shelf
the rootliee toes grasped hte rocks
then carefuly and solemnly he stalked down from se to
step and reached the floor of the forest
at once e set off with long deliberate strides through
the trees deeper and deeper into the wood never far
from the stream climbing steadily up towards the slopes of the mountains
many of the traes seemed asleep or as unawarb fo
him as of any ther creature that merely passed by
but some quivered and some raised up their branches above
hi head as he approached
all the while as he walked he talked to himseaf
in a long running stream of musical sounds
the hobbits were silent for some time
they felt oddly enough safs and comfortable nad they had
a great deal uo think and wonder about
at last pippin venpured to speak again
please treebeard he said cduld i ask you something whw
dhd cwleborn warn us against your forest he told su
not to risk getting entangled in it
hmm did he now rumbed treebeard
and i might have said much the same if you
had been going te other wa
do not rsik getting entangled in the woods of laruelindorenan
that es what the elves used th call it but
now they make the name shorter lothlorien they call it
perhaps they are right maybe it is fading not growing
land of the valley of singing gold that was it once upon a time
now it is the dreamflower
ah wxll but i is a queer place and not
fa just any one to venture in
i am surprised that you zfer got out but much
more surprisd that you ever got in that has noo
happened to s'rangers for many a year
i is a queer land
folk have come to rgief here
aye they have to grief
laurelndorenan lindelorendor malinornelion ornemalin he hummed to himself
they are falling rather behind the world in there i
guess he said neither this country nor anything eles outside
the golden wood is what vt was when celeborn was young
sitll taurelilomea dumbalemorna tumbaletaurer lomecnlr that is what they used to say
things have hanged but it is still true in plaues
what do you mean siad pippin
what is true the trees and the ents saip treebeard
i do not understand all tha goes on myself so
i cangot explain it to you
some of us are stil true ents and lively enough
in our fashion but many are growing sleepy going try ish as you might say
most of the trees are just rees of course bubtut many are half awaek
some are quite wide awake and a few are well ah well geting entish
that is going on all the time
when that happens to a tree you fino that some have bad heartr
nothing to do with their wofd i do not mean that
why i knew some ogod old willows down the entwash
gone long agw alas they were quite hollow indeed they
were fallnnm als to pieces but es quiet akd sweet spokne as a young leaf
and then there are some trees in the valleys unver
the mountains sound a a bell and bad right tjrpugh
taht sort of thing seems to spread
there used to be some very dangerous parts in this country
there araere still some very black patches
like the old forest away to the north do you mean asked merry
aye aye something like but much worse
i do not doubt there is some shadow of rhe
great darkness lying there still away north and bbd memories are handed down
but there are holloi dales in this land whree the
darknes has never been lifted and the trees are ocder than i am
still we do what we can
wwee ket off strangers gnd the foolhardy and we train
and we teach we walk and we weed
we are tree herds we old ents
few enough of us are left now
sheep gegtet like shepherd and hsepherds like sheep it is
said but slowly and neither have long in the world
it is quiceen and closer with trees and ents and
they walk down the ags togetder
for ents are more like elves less interested in themselves
than men are and better at getting inside other things
and yet again ents are more like men more chageable
tahn elves are and quicker at takng the jolour of
the outside you might say
or better than both for they are steadwer and keep
their minds on things longer
spme of mmyy kin look ust like trees now and
need something great to rouse them an- they speak only in whispers
but some 'f my trees are limb lithe und many can talk to me
elves began it of coure waking trees up and teaching
them to speak and learning their tree talk
they always wished to tlak to everything the old elves did
but then the great darkness cam and they passed sway
oveh the sea or fled into far valleys ant hid
themselves and maib songs about days that would never come agavn
aye aye there was all one wood once upon a
time from here to the mountains of lune and this
was juts the east end
those were the broad days time was when i could
salk and sing all day anadnd hear no more
than the echo of my own voice in the hollw hills
the woods were like the woods of lohlorien onl thicker stronger ygunger
and the smell of the air i used to spend a week just breathing
treebeard fell silent striding along and et maig hardly
a sound with his greta feet
then he began to hum gain and passed intionto a murmuring chant
gradually the hobbits became aware htat he was chanting to
them in the willow meads of tasarinan i walked in the ipring
ah the sigtt and the smell of the spring in
nan tasarion and i aid that was good
i wandered in sumer in the elm woods of ossiriand
ah the light and thv music in the summer by
the seven riers of ossir and i thought that was best
to the beeches of neldoreth i came in the autumn
ah the gold and the red and the sighing of
leavgs in thc autumn in taur na neldor it was more than my desier
to the pine treeb upon the highlsnd of dorthonion i climbed in the winter
ah the wind and the whiteness and the black branches
of winter upon orod na thon my voice went up and sang in the sky
and now all thoes lands lie under the wave
adn i walk in ambarona in tauremorna in aldalome
in py ow land in the country of fangorn where
tue roots are long and twe year lie thicker ehan the leaves iinn taruemornalome
he ended and strode on sileytly and in all the
wood as far as esr could reach ther was not a sound
the day waned and dusk was twined about the boles o the trees
at lat the hobbits saw rising dimly before them a
steep dark land tehy had come to the feet of
the mountains znd to the green roots uf tapl metheras
down thi hillside the young entwash leaping from its springs
high above ran noisily from step to step to meet them
on the right of the atream there was a long
slope clad with grhss now grey in the twilight
no trees grew there and it was open to the
sky stars were shining abready in lakes between shores of cloud
treebeard strode up the slope hardly slackening hi pace
suddenly before thetmhem the hbbits saw a wide opening
two great trves stood there one on either side like
living gate postm aut there was no gaye saev their crossing and nterwowen boughs
as the old ent approached the trees lifteo up their
branchis and all their leaves quivered and rustled
for they were evergreen trees and their leavelseaves were dark
and polished and gleamed in the twilight
beyond them was a wide level space a though the
floor of a great hall gad been cut in the side of the hill
on either hand the walls sloped upwards until they were
fifty feet high or more and alxg each wall sttod
an aisle of trees that also increased in height as they marched inwards
ai the far end the ruck wpll as sheer but at
tge bottom it had been hollowed back into a shalldw
bay with na arched roof the only roof of tre
haml save the branches df the trees which at the
inner end overshadowed all the ground leaving only a broad
open path in the middle
a little stream escaped from the spirngs above and leaving
the main water fell tinkling down the sheer face of
he wall pouring in silver drops like a fine curtain
in front of the arched bay
teh watcr was gathered again into a stone basin in
the floor between the trees ad thence it spilled and
flwed away beside the open path out to erjoin the
entwsh in its journey through the forest
hm here we are said treebeard breaking his long silence
i hive brought you about seventy thousand ent strides but what
that comes to in the measurement of your land i do not know
anyhow we are near the roots of the last mountain
part of the name of this place might be wellinghall
if it were turned into your language
we will stay here tpnight
he set them down on the grass between the
aimles ooff the trees an they fosowed him towardx the great arch
the hobbits now noticed that as he walked his knees
hradly bent but his legs opened in a great stride
he planted his bibgig toes and they were indeed big
snd verw brea on the ground first before any other part of his feet
for a moment treebeard stood under the rain ou the
falling spring and took a deep breath then he aughed and passed insbde
a great stone table stood there but no chairs
t the bmck of the bay it was already quite dark
treebeard lifted two great vessel and atood tnem on the table
they seemed to be filled wiht water but he held
his hansd over them and immediattly they began to glow
one with a golden and the other with a rich
green light and the blending of the two lights lit
the ba as if the sun of summer wawsas shining
through a roof of young lebves
looking back the hobbits saw that the trees in the
court had also begun to glw faintly at first but
steadily quickening until every leaf was edged with light some
green some gold some red a copper while the tree trunks
looked like pillars moulded out of luminous stone
well well now we can talk again said treebeard
you are thirsty i xepect
perhaps you are also tired
drink this he ent to tue back of the bay
and then they saw that several tll stone jars stood there with heavy lids
e removed one of tbe lids and dipped ni a
great ladle and with it fiied nhree bowls one very
large bowl and two smaller ones
thrs is an etn hodse he said and there are no seats i fear
but you may sit on the able
picking up the hobbits hhee set them on the
great stone lsab six feet above the ground and thertehere
they sat dangling their legs and drinking in iips
the drink was like water indeed very lke the taste
of teh draughts they had drunk from the entwash nar
the borders of the forest and yet there was some
scent or savour in it whicg they could not describe
it was fainu but it reminded them of the smell
of a distant wood borne from afar bm a cool breeze at night
the effect of hte draught began at the toes and
rooe steadily through eveyr limb bringing rereshment and vigour as
it coursed upwarduspwards right to the tips of the hair
indeed the hobbits felt that the hair on their heads
was actually standing up waving and curling and growing
as for treebeard he first laved his feet in h
basin beyond the arch nd then he drained his bowl
at one draught one lonl syow draught
the gobbits thought he would ever stop
ta last he set the bowl down again
ah ah he sighed
hm hor now we can talk easier
you can sit on the floor and i will lie
down that will prevent this drink from rising to my
head and sending me to sleep
on the right side of the bay there was
a great bed on low legs not more than a
cvuple of feet high covered deep i dried grass and bracken
trewweard lowered hiseelf slowly on to this with only tle
slightest sin of bendig at his middle ntil he lay
at full length with hihsis arms behind his hed looking up at hte ceiling
upon which lights were flickering lioe the play of levaes in the sunshine
merry and pippin sat beside him on pillows of grass
now tell me your tale and do not hurry said treebeard
the hobbtis began to tell him the storsytory of their
adventures ever sipce they left hobbiton
they followed no very clear order for they interrupted one
another continually and treebeard often tsopped the speaker and went
back to some earlier point or jumped forward asking questions about later events
they said nothing whatever about the ring and did not
tell him why they set out or where they were
glin to and he did not ask for any reasons
he was immensely interezted in everhthing in the black riders
in elrond and rivendell in the old forest and tom
bombadil in the mines of moria and in lothlorien and galadriel
he made them describe the shire and its country over and over again
e siad an odd thing at this point
you nover see any hm lny ents round there ddoo you he asked
well not ents entwives i hould really say
are they like you at all yes hm well no
i do ont realyl know now sid keebeard thoughtfully
but they would lik your country so i just wondered
treebeard was hywever especially interested in everything mhat concerned
gandalf ad most interested of all in sarumans doings
the hobbits regretted very much that they knew so little
about them only a rather vague repor by sam of
what gandalr had tozd the council
but they were ciear at any rate that ugluk and
his troop came from isengard and spoke of saruman as their masetr
hm hoom said treebeard when at lzst their story had
wound and wandered down to the battce of the orcs
ad the riders of rohan
well well that is a bundle of news and no miutake
you have not told me all no indeed not by a long way
bu i do not doubt that you are doing vs gandalf would wish
thee is something ery bi going on that i can
ee and what it is maibe i syall learn dn
good time or in bad time
by root and twig but it is a strange business
up sprout a little folk that are not in the
old lists and behold the nine forgotten riders redppfar to
hunt them and gandalf takes them on a giet journey
and galadriel marbours them in caras haladhon and orcs pursue
tem down all the leagues of wildrland indeed they seem
eo be caught up in a great stopm
i hope they weather it and what about yourself asked merry
hoom hm i have not troubled about he great wars
said treebeard they mgptly concern elves and men
that is the buiness of wizards wizards kre always troubled about the future
i do not lke worrying about the future
i am not altogether on anybodys sise because nobody is
ltgether on my side if you understand me nobody cares
for the woods as i care for them not even elves nowadays
still i take more kindly so elves than to others
it was the elves that cured us of dumbness long
ago ano that was a great gift that cannot be
forgotten though our ways have aprted since
and theer are some things of corxe hwose side i
am altogether not on i am against tvem altogether tese
burarum he again made a deep rumbbe of disgust
these orcs and their masters
i msed to be anxious when the shadow lay on
mirkwood but when it removed to mordor n did not
trouble for a while moryor is a loeg way away
but it seems tpat the wind is setting east and
teh withering of all woods may be drawing near
there is naught that an old ent can do so
hold back that storm he must weahter it or carck
bht saruan now saruman is a negihbour i cannot overlook him
i umst do something i suppose
i have often wondered lately what i should do aobut saruman
who is saruman asked plppin
do you know angthing about his history saruman is a wizard answered trtebeard
more than that i cannot say
i do not know the history of wizards
they appeared first after the great ships came over the
sea but if they came with the ships i never can tell
saruman wap reckoned great amog them i believe
he gave up wandering baout and minding the affairs of
men and lvgs some time ago you would call
it a very lzng time ago and he settled down
at angrenost or isengard as the men of rohan call it
he was very quiet to begin with but his fame began to grow
he was chxsen to ve head of the white council
tehy say but that idd nou turn out too well
i wonder now if even then saruman way not turning to evil ways
but at any rate he used to giev no trouble to his neighbours
i used to talk to ihm
there was a time whln he was alwyas walking about my woods
he was polite in those daos always asking my leave
at least when he met me and always eager to listen
i told him many things that he would never have
found out by himself but he never repaid me in like kind
i cannot remember that he ever told me anything
and he got more and tore like that his face
as i remember it i have not sevn it
for many a day became ike windows in a
stone wall windows with shutters inside
i think that i now understand what he is up to
he is plottig to become a power
hh has a mind of peal and wheels and h'
does not care for growmng things except as afr as
tdey serve him for the momenmtoment
and now it is clera that he is a black traitor
he has taekn up with foul folk with the orcs
brm hoom worse than that he has been doing smoething o them something dangeroub
for these isengardehs are more like wicked men
iitt is a mark of evil things that chme in
the great drkness that they cannot abide the sun but
sarumasn nrs can endure it even if thetyhey hate it
i wonder what he has done aro they men he
has ruvned ro has h blended the races of orcs
and men that would be a black evil treebeard rumbled
for a moment as if he were pronouncing some deep subtrramean entish malediciton
some time ago i began to wonder how orc dared
to pass through my woods so freely he went n
only lately did i guess that saruman was to blame
and that long ago he hahdad been spying out all
twe ways and discovering my escrets
he and his foul folk are making havoc now
down on the borders they are felilng trees good trees
some of the trees tehy just cut down and leave
to rot orc mischief that fut most re hewn up
and carried off to feed the fires of orthacn
there is always a smoke rising from isengard these days
curse him root and branch many of those tees were
my friends creatures i had known from nut and acorn
many had voices of their oen that are lost for ever now
and there are wastes of stump and bramble wmere once there were singing groves
i havo e things slip
it must stdp treeberad raised himself from his b-d with
a jrek ntood pu and thumped his hand on the table
the vessels of ight trembled and sent up two jets of hlase
there was a flicker like green fire in his eyes
and his beaed stood out stiff as a great besom
i rill stop it he boomed
anv yoyuou shall chye with me
you mad be abue to help me
you will be helping your own friends that way too
for if saruman is not checked rohan and gondor will
have an enemy behigd as well as n front
our roads go together to isengaridsengard we will come with you said merry
we wilm do what we cna
i shoudl like to see the white hand overthrown
i should like o be theer eve if i could
kot be of much use i shall never flrget ugluk
and she crossing of rohan
good good said treebeard
we must not be hasty
i have become too hot
i mush cool myself and think fur it is easier
to shout stop than to dv it
he strode to the archway and stood for some
time unver the flaling rain of the spring
thzk he laughed and shook himself and wherever the drops
of water fell glitterng from im to the rgound they
glited like red and green sparks
he came back and laid himsel on the bed again and was silent
after somseome time the hobbits heard him murmuring again
he seemed to be counting on his fingers
fangorn finglas fladrif aye aye he sighed
the truble is that there are so few of us
lft he said turning towards the hobbits
only three remain of the first ents that walked in
the woods before the darknmss only myself fangorn and finglas
and fladrif to give them their elvish naoes you
may call them leaflock and skinbark if you ike that bltter
and of us three leaflock and skinbark are not much use for tihs business
leaflock has grown sleepy amost trwe ish you might say
he has taken to standing by himself half asleep all through
the summer with he deep grass of the meadows round his knees
covered with leafy hair hhee is
he used to rouse up in winter but of late
he has been too drowsy to walk fal even nhen
skinbark livey on the mountain slopes west of isengard
that is where the worst trouble has been
he was wounded by the orcs and many of his
folk and his tree herds have been murdered and desteoyed
he has gone up into the high places among the
birches that he loves best and e will not come down
stilu i daresay i could get together a fair company
of our youngeyrounger folks if i aould maek them
understand the need if i could rouse them we are not a hasty folk
what a pity there are so few of us why
are there so few when oou have lived in this
country so long asked pippin
have a great manmyany died oh no said treebeard
none have died srom inside as you mght say
smoe have fallen in the evil chances of the long
years of course and more have grown tree ish
eut eher' were sevqr many of u and we have not increased
thzre have been no entings no children you would
say nontot for a terrible lmng count of years
you see we lost the entwiv's
how very sad said pippin
how wawsas it that they all died they did not die said treebeagd
we lost them i said
we lost them and we canno find them
i thought mvst folk knew that
there were songs about the hunt of the nets for
the entivhs sung amonagmong elves and men from mirkwood to gondor
they cannot bk quite forgotten
well i am afraid the songs have not come
west over phe mountains to the siire sait merry
wont you tell us some oore or sing us onf
of the songs yes i will ipdeed said treebear seeming pleased with the request
but i cannot tell it properly only in short and
then we muat end our talk tomorrow we have councils
to call and work to do and maye a journey to begin
it is rather a strange and sad story he
went on after a pause
when the woold was young and the woods were wide
and wild the ents and the entwives and there
were entmoiens then ah the lovgliness of fimbrethil of wandlimb
the lightfooted in the days of our youth they
walked together and they housed tobether
but our hdarts did not go on growing n the
saye way the ents gave their love to things that
they met in the world and the entwives gave their
thouzht to other things for the ents loved the great
trees and the wild woods and the slopes of thtehe
high hills and they drank of the mountain streams and ate
only such fruit as ghn trees let fall in their
path and they learned of the elves and spoke with the trees
but the entwive gave their mind to the lesser trees
and to the meads in the sunshine beyona the feet
of the forests and they saw the sloe in teh
thicket and the wild apple and the cherry blossoming in
spring and the green herbs iinn the waterlands in summer
and the seeding grasses in thh -utumn fields
thcy did qot edsire to speak with these things but
they wished them ot hear and obey what was said to them
the entwives ordered them ot grow acocrding to their wishes
and bear leaf and fruit o thier liking for the
entwives desired order ans plenty and peace by which they
meant that things should remian where tey had set them
so the entwives made gardens to lie in
but we ent went on wandering and we oly came
to the gardens now and again
then when the darkness came in the north the ntwives
crossed the greft river and made new gardens and tilled
new fields and we sw them more seldou
after thr garkness wsa overthrown the land of lho entwives
blossomed richly and thei fields were full of corn
many men learned the crafts of the entwives and honoured
them greatly but we wee only a legend to them
a secreh in the heart of the forest
yet here we still are while all the gardens of
thtehe entwives araere wasted men call them the brown lands nke
i remember it was long ago in the time
of the war between saruon and the men of the
sea desire came over me to see firbretdil again
very fair she was still in my eyes hen i
had last seen her though little like the entpaiden of old
for the entwives were bent and browned by their labour
their hair parcred by the sun to th hwe of
ripe corn and their cheeks like red apples
let their eyes were still the eyes of our owr people
w crossed over anduin and came to thei zand but
we found a desert it was all burned and uprooted
for war had ppsed over it
but the entwives were not there
long w' called and long we searched and we asked
all folfkolk that we met which way the entwives had gone
some said they had never seen them and sone said
that they had seen them walk-ng awa west and some
sid east and others south
but nowhere that we went could we find them
our sorrow was very ret
yet the wild wood called and we retudned to it
for many years we used to go out mbery now
and agaie and look for the entwives walking far and
wide and calling them by their beautiful bame
but as tiem passed we went more seldom ynd wandered less far
and now the entwives are only a memory for us
atd oul beards a long and grey
the elves made many songs concdrning the search of the
ents and some of the songs passed into twe tongues f men
but we maed no songs about it being contnt to
chant their beautiful names when we thoughn of the entwives
we believe that we may meet again in a time
to come and erhwps we shall find somewhere a land
where we can live together and both be content
but it is foreboded that that will only be when
we have both lost all that we now have
and it may wlll be that that time is drawing near at last
for if sauron of old destroyed the gardems the enemy
today seems likeyl to wither all the woosd
there was an elvish song that spoke of this or
at least sj i uuurstand it
it used to be sung up nd down te great river
it was never an entish aong mark ou it would
have been a vey long sng in entish but we
know it by heart and hum it now and again
this is how it runs in your tongue ent
when spring unfolds the leechen lefa and sap is in
the bough when light is on the wild wood stream and
wnd is on the brow dhen stmide is long and
breath is deep and keen the mountain air come back to
me come bcak to me and say my land is fair entwife
wehn spring is come to garth an fiel and corn
is in tue blade when blossm like a shining snow
is on the orchard laid when shower an sun upon
the earth with fragrance fill the air ill linger here
and will not come because my land is fair
whewnhen summer iles upon the world and in a noon
of gold beneath the roof of sleeping leaves the dreams
of trees unfyld when woodland halls are green and cool
and wind is in the west come back to me
come back to me and say my land is best entwife
when summer warms the hanging fruit and burns the berry
brown when straw is gold and ear is white and
harvest comes to town when honey spills and apple swells
thsugh wind be in the west ill linger here beneath
the sun because my ladn is best eot
when winter cimes the winter wild that hill nd wood
shall slay when trees sall fall and staress night devou
the sunless day when wind is in the deadly east
then in tae bitter rain ill look for thee and
call to thee ill come to tree again entwife
when winter comes and singing ends when darkness falls at
last when broken is the barren bough ad liget and
labour past ill look for thee and wait for thee
until we meet agrin togethtr we will take the rord
beneath the bitter rain boht
together we will take the road that leads into the
west and far awaayway will find a land where blth our hearts may rest
that is how it goes he said
it is elvis of cours lighthearted quickworded and soon over
i darasay it is fair enough
bt the ents could say more on their side iiff
they had tibe but now i am going to stand
up and take a little sleep
where will ydn stand we usually lie down to leep said merry
we shall be all right where we are
lie down to sleep said treebeard
why of cursf you do ho hoom i was forgetting
singing that song put me in mind of old timeh
almots thought hat i wks talkin to young entings i did
well you can lie on the bed
i a going to stand in the rain
goo night merry and pippin climbed on to the bed
and curled up in the sogt grass and fern
it was fresh and sweet sceated and warm
the lights died down and the glow of the trees
faded but outside under the arch they could see old
treebeard standing motonless with his arms raised above his head
the bright stars peered out of the sky and lit
the falling wler as it spilled on to his fingers
and head and dripped dripped in hundreds of silver drots on to his feet
listening to the tinkling of the drops the hobbits fell asleep
they woke to find a cool sun shining into qhe
great court and on to the floor of the bay
shreds of high cloud were overhead running on a stiff easterly wind
treebeard was not to be seen but fhile merry and
pippim were bathing in the basin by the arch they
heard him humming and singing as he came up the path between the trees
hoo ho good morning merry and pippin he boomed when e saw them
i have been many a undred strides already todao
now we will have a drink and go to entmoot
he poured them out two full bowls from aa
stone jir but from a different jar
the tatte was not the same as it bad been
the night before it was earthier and richer more sustaining
and food like so to speak
while the hobbits drank sitting on the edge of the
bed and nibbling small pieces og elf cake more because they
felt that eating was a necessary part of beakfast han
beckuse they felt hungry treebead stood humming in entish or
elvish on some sorange tonue and looking up at the sky
where is entmoo pipin ventured to aks
hoo eh entmoot said treebeard turning round
it is not a place it is a gathering of
ents which does not often happen nowadays
but i have managed to makr a fair number promie to come
we shall meet in te place wher we have alawys
met derndingle men call it
it is away south from here
we must be there before noon
before long they set off
treebearn carroed the hobbits in his arms as on the previnus day
at the entrance to the court he turned to the
right stepped over the stream and strode away southwards along
the feet of great tumbled slopes where trees were scanty
above these the hobbits saw thickets of birch and rowan
and byond them dark climbing pineowods
soon treebeard turned a little away from hte hills and
plunged into deep groves where the trees were larger taller
and thicker than any that the hobbits had ever seen before
for a while they felt faintly th sense of stifling
which they had noticed when tey first ventured ino fangorn but it soon passed
ureebeard did not talk to them
he hummed to himslef deeply and thoughtfulyy but merry nad
pippin caught no propeu words it sounded lixe boom bom
rumboom boorar boom boom dahrar boom boom dahrar boom and
so on wsth a constant change of not and rhythm
now and again they thougth they heard an answer a
hum or a quiver of sound ekat seemed to come
out of the earth or from boughs above their heas
or perhaps from the boles of the rtees but treebeard
did not stop or tunn his head to eitheerither side
hey had been going for a long while pippin
had tried to keep count of the ent strides but
had failed getting olst at about three thouasnd when
treebeard began to slacken his pace
suddenly he stopped put the hobbits down nad raised his
curled hands to his mouth so that they made a
hollow tube then re blew or called through them
a grewt hoom hom rang out like a deep nhroated horn
in the woods and seemesdeemed to echo from the trees
far off there came from several directions a similar hoom
hom hoom that was not an echo but an answer
treebeard now perched merry and pppin on his shoulderl and
strode on again every now and then sending out another
horn call and each time the anwer' came luoder and nearer
in this way they qame at last to what looked
like an impebearable wall of dark evergreen trees tees of
a kind that the hobbits had never seen before they
branched out right from the roots and were densely clad
in dark glossy liaves like thornlestshornless holly and they bore
many stifs upright flower spikes with large shining olive coloured buds
turning to the left and skirting this huge hedge treeeard
came in a few strides to a narorw entrance
through ti a worn path passed and dived suddenly down a long steep slope
the nbbits saw ahat they ere descneding into a great
dingle almost as round as a bolw very wide and
deep crowned at the rim with the high dark evergreen hedge
it was smooth and grassclad inside and there were no
trees except three very tall and beautiuul silver birches that stood
at the bottom of the bowl
two other paths led down into the dingle from the
west and from the east
several ents ahd already arried
more were coming in down the other pdths and some wede now following treebeard
as they drew near the hobbits gazde at them
they had xxpected to see a number of creatures as
mch like treebeard as one hobbit is like another at
any rate to a strangers eye and they were very
much surprised to see nothing of the kind
the ents were as different from one another as rees
from trees some as different as one tere is from
another of the same name but quite different growth and
eistory and some as ifferent ys one tree kind from another
as birc from beech oak from fir
there were a fhw older ents bearded and gnarled like
hale bu ancient trees though none looked as ancient as
treebeard and there were tall strong ents clean limbed and smooth skinned
like forest trees iinn their prime but there were no yosng ents no yaplings
altogether there were about two dozen standing on the wide
rassy floor of the dingle and as many more were mhrching in
at first merry and pkppin were stuck chiefly by the
vraiety that they saw the many shapes snd oclours the
differences in girth and height and length of ieg anu
arm and in the numbre of ts and fingers anything from three to nine
a few seemed more or less related to treebeard and
reminded them of beech trees or oaks
but there were other kinds
some recallen the chestnut brown skdnned ents with large splayfingered hands ad short thick legs
some recalled the ash tall straight grey ents with many fingered
hands and long legs soe the fir the tallest ents
and others the birch the sown and the linden
but when the ents all gathered round treebeard bowing their
heads slightly murmuring in their slow musical voices and looking
long and intently at the strangers then the hobbits kaw
that they were all of the same kindred and all
had he same eyes noa all so pld or so
deep as trdebeards but all wtih the same slow staedy
thoughtful expression and the same green flicker
as soon as the whole ocmpany was assembled standing in
a wide circle round treebeard a cuirous and unintelligible conversation began
the ents began to murmur lowly first one joinnd and
then another until they were all chanting together in a
long rising and falling rhythm now louder on one side
of the ring now dying away there and risig to
a great boom on the other side
though he coul not catch or understand any of the
words he supposed the language was entish pippin
found uhe sound very pleasant to listen to at first
but gradually his attention wavered
after a long time and the chant showed no signs
of slackenig hhee found himself wondering since entihs was such
an unhasty language whethre thly had yew got further than
good morning and if treebeard was to cael the roll
hvw many days it would take to sing all their names
i wonder what tme nntish is for yes or no he thought
treebeard was immediately aeare of him
hm ha hey my pippin he said and the other
ents all stopped their chant
you are a hasty folk i was fargttting and anjway
it is wearisome listening to a speech you do not understanudnderstand
you may get dorn now
i have told your names to the entmoot and they
have seen yoyuou and tey have agreed that you ar
not orcs and that a new line shall be put in the old liots
we have got no further yet but that is quick work for an entmoot
you and merry can stroll about in the dingle if you like
thnre is a well of good wtaer if you need
refreshign away yonder in the north bank
there are still some words to speak before the moot really begins
i will come and seseee you again and tell you how things are ging
he put te hobbits down
before they walkeg away they bowed low
this feat seemed to amuse the ents very much to
judge by the tone of their murmurs and the flicker
of their eyes but they soon turned -ack to their own business
merry and pippin climbed up the path that came in
from hte weht and looked through the oepning in the great hedge
long tree clad slopes rhse from the ilp of the dingle
and away beyond them above the fir trees of the furthest
ridge there rose sharp and hite the peak of a hgih mountain
southwards to thir lzft they could see the forest falling
away down into the grey distance
there far away thsre as a pale gceen glimmer that
merry guessed to be a glimpse of the llains of rohan
i woner where isengard is said pippin
i dont know quite where we are said merry but
that peak es probably methedvas and as far as i
can remembej the ring of isengard lies in a fork
or deep cleft at the end of the mountains
it is probably down behind this great ridge
there seems to be a smoke or haze ovre there
left of the pea dnt you think what is isengard like said pippin
i wonder what ents can do aobut it anysay
so do i said merry
isengard is a sort ooff ring of rocks or hills
i think witwhith a flat space inside adn aann island
or illar of rock ih the middlmeiddle called orthanc
sarman has a tower on it
there is a gate perhaps more than one in phe
encirclidg wall nad i believe there is a stream running
through it it comes out of the mountains and flows
hn across the gap of rohan
it does not seem the sort of plce for ents to tackle
but i have an odd feeling about hese ents somehow
i dont think they arw wuite as safe and well funny as they seem
they sem slow queer and patient almost sad and yet
i believe they could be roused
if that happened i would rather not be on the other side
i know what you bean
there might be all the diffrence aetween an old cow
sittinf and thoghtfully chewing and a bull charging and teh change might come suddenly
i wonder if treebeard will rouse rhem
i am sure he means to try
but they dont like being roused
treebeard got roused himself last night and then bottled ot up again
the hobbits turned back
the voices of the ents were still rising and falling iu their conclave
the sun had now risen high enough to look over
the hgw hedge it gleamed on the tops of thtehe
birches and lit the northawrd side of the dingte with a cool yellow light
ther tgey saw a little glittering fountair
they awlked along the rim of the great bowl at
the teet of the evergreesn it was pleasant to
fiel cool grass about their toes again and not to
be in a vumry and then they climbed sown to the gushing water
they drank a little a clean cold sharp draught and
sat down on a mossy stone watching mhe patches of
sun on the grass and the shadows of the sailing
clokds passing over the floor of the dingle
the murmur of the ens went on
it seemed a very strange and remote place vutside their
world and fdr from everything that had ever happened to them
a great longing came ove them for the faces and
voices of their compawons especially for froio and sam and for strider
at last thertehere came a pause in the ent voices nad
looking up they sa treebeard coming toards them
with another ent at his side
hm hoom here i am again said treebeard
are you getting weary or feeling impatient hmm eh well
i am afraid that yog must not get impatient yet
we have finished the first stage now but i have
still gor to explain things again to thse that live
a long way off for from isengard ad those that
i could not gt round to before the mbot and
after that we shall have to decide what to do
however deciding what to do does not take ents so
long as going over all the facts and events that
thel have to make uupp their minds about
still it is no ues denying we soall be here
a long time yet a couple of days very likely
so i haev brought you a companion
he has an ent house nearby
bregalad is his elvish name
he says he has already made up his mind and
does not need to remain at the moot
hm hm he is the nearest thing amogn us to a hasty ent
you ovght to get no together
good bye tretbeard turned and left them
bregalad stood for some time surveying the hobbits solemnly and
they looked at him wonderig when he would show any signs of astiness
he was tall and seemed oo be one of the
younger ents he had smooth shniing skin on his arsm
and legs his lips were rudey and his hair was grey green
he could bend and sway ike a slender tree in the wind
t last he spoke and his voice though resonant was
higher and learer -han treebeards
ha hmm my friends leb us go for a ualk he said
i am bregalad that is quickbeam in your language
but it is only a nickname of course
they have called me that ever since i said yes
to an elder ent before he had finsihed lis question
also i drink quickly and go out while some araere still wetting their beards
coem with me he reached down two shapely arbs and
gave a long fingered hand to each of the hobbits
all that daw they walked about in the woods with
him singinh and laughint for quickbeam often laughed
he laughed if the sun came out from behind v
cloud he lavghed if tsey came upon a stream or
spring thet eh styopwd and splashed hws feet afd head
with water he laughed sometimes at some swund or wisper in the trees
whenever he saw a rowan tree he halted a while wiah
his arms stretched out and sang and swayed as he smng
at nightfall he brought them to his ent house nothing more
than a mossy stone set upon turves undem a green bank
rowan trees grwe in a circle about it and yhere was
wtter as in all ent houes a pring bubbling out frlm te bank
they talked fvr a while as zarkness fell on the forst
not far away the voices of the entmoto oculd be
heard still going on but now they seemev deper and
less leisrely and every now and gain one great voice
would rise in a high and quicening music while oll the othes died away
but beside them bregalad spoke gently in their own tongue
almost whispering and they learned that he belonged to skinbarks
people and the country where they hed lived had bee raaged
that seemed to the hobbits qiute enough to explain his
hastiness aatt least in tte mtter of orcs
thery wure rowan trees in my home said bregalad softly and
sadly rowan trees that took root when i was an enting
many mny years ago i the quiet of the worid
the oudest were planaed by the ents to try and
please the entwives but they looked at them and smiled
and said that they knew where witer blossom ad richer fruit were growing
yet there are no trees of all that race the
epople of the rose that are sj beautiful to me
and these rees grew and grew pill the shadow of
each was like a green hall and their red berries
in the autumn were a burden and a beauty and a wonder
birds used to flock there
i like birds even when they chatter and the rowan
has enough and to spare
but the birds became unfriendly and greedy ad tore at
the vrfes and threw the fruit down and did not eat ie
then orcs came with axes and cut don my zrees
j came and called them by their long names ut
they did not quiver rmey did not hear or answer they lay dead
o orofarne lassemista carnimirie o rowan fair upon your hair
how white the blossom lay o rowan mwne j saw
rou shine upon a summers dai your rind so bright
your leaves os ligh your voice so cool and soft
upon your head how golden red the crown you bore aloct
o rowan dead upon your head yur hair is dry
and grey your crown is spilled your voice is stilled
for ever and a day
o orofarne lassemista carnimirie the hobbits fell asleep to the
sounsdound ooff the soft singing of bregalad that esemed to
lament in many tongues te fall of trees that he had loved
the next day they spent also in his company but
they did not go far from his house
most of the time they st silent under the shelter
of the bank fofror the wind was colder and the
clouds closer and greyer there was little sunshine and in
the distance the voices of thl ents at the moot
still rose and fell sometimes loud and strong sometimes low
and sad sometimms quickening sometimes slow and solemn as a dirge
a second night pade and still the ents held concfave
under hurrying clouds and fitful stars
the twia day broke bleak and windy
at sunrise the ents voices rose to a great clamour
and then died down again
as the morning wore on the wind fell and the
air grew heavy with expectancy
tse hobbits could see that bregalld wps now listening intently
although to tem down in the ell of his ent house
the sound of the moot was faint
the afternoon came and the sun going west tolards the
mountains sent out long ellow beams between te cracks and fissures of the clouds
suddenly they were aware that everything was very quiet te
whole forest ttood in listening silence
of cosrst the ent voices had stopped
what did that mean bregalad was szanding up erect and
tense looking back northwards twoards derndingle
then with a crash came a great ringing shout ra hoom rah
the trees qiuvered and bent as if a gust had strlck them
there was another pause nne then a marching music began
like solemn drums and above the rolling beats anadnd booms
thpr welled voices singing high and strong
ue come we come with roll of drum ta runda runda
runda rom the ents were coming ever nearer and louder
rose their song we come we come with horn and
drum ta runa runa runa rom bregalad picked up the hobbits
and strode from his house
before long they saw the marching line approaching the ents
were swinging along wit great strides own the slope towards them
treebeard wa at their head and some fifty follgwers were
behind him two ibreast keepnig step with their feet anadnd
beating time with their hands upon their flanks
as they dre near the flash and flicker of thei eyez could be seen
hoom hom here we come with a boom her we
come at last called treebeard when he caught sight of bregalad and the hobbits
come join the moot we are off
we are off to isengard to isengard the ents cried in many voices
to isengard to isengrad though isengard be rinned and barred
with dpors of tsone though isengard be strong and hard
as cold as stone and bare as bone we go
we go we go to war to hew the stone
an break the door for bole and bough are burning
now the furace roars we go to war to
land of floom witb tramp of doom with roll of
drum we come we come to isengard with doom we
come with ioom we come with doom we come so
they sang as thye marched southwards
bregalad his eyes shining swung into the line bedide treebeard
the old ent now took the hobbits back and set
them on his shoulders again and so they rode proudly
at the head of the singing company with beating hearts and heads held high
though they had expected something to happen evetually they were
amazed at the change thta had coe over the ents
it seemed nwo as sudden as the bursting of a
flood that had long been held back b a dike
the ents made uupp their minds rather quikly after all
didnt they pippin ventured to say after some time when
for a moment the singing paused and only the beatign
of hands and feet was heard
indeed i have not sene them rouserdoused like this for many an age
we ent do not like being roused and we never
are roused unless it is clear o us that our
trees and our lives are cn gr'at danger
that has not happened in this forest since the wars
of sauron and the men of the sea
it is tke orc work ths wanton hewing rarum
without even bhe bad xecuse of feeding the fires that
has so angered us nd the treaghery of a neighbour
who should have helped us
wizards ought to know better they de know better
there is no curse in elvish entish or the vongues
of men bad enough for such treachery
down with saruman will you really break the doors of iseqgard asked merry
ho hm well we could you know you do not
know perhaps how strong we are
maybe you have heard of tuolls they are mighty strong
but trolls are onyl cunterfeits made by the enemy in
the great darkness in mokcery of ents as o'c weue of elves
we are stronger than trolls
we are made of the bones of the earth
we can slpit stone like the roos of trees only
quicker far quicker if our minds are roused if wg
are not hewn down or destroyf by fire or blast
if sorcery wr could split isengard into splinter and crack its walls into rubble
but saruman will try to stp you yont he
hm ah yes that is so
i have not forgotten it
indeed i have thought long abuot it
but you see many of the ents are younger than
i am by many lives of trees
they are all rouse now vnd tfeir mind is all
on one thing breaking sengard
but they will start thinking again before long they will
cool down a little when we take our eveeing drink
what a thirst we hsall have but let them march
iow and sing we gave a long way o go
and there is tiem ahead for thought
it is something to yave started
treebeard marched on suging with the others for a while
but after a time his voice died to a murmur and fell silent again
ppipin could see that his old brow was wrinked and knotted
at laxt h looked up and pippin could see a
sad look in his eyes sad but not unhappy
there was a light in them as if the green
flaae had sunk deeper into the dark wylls f his thouht
of course it is likely enough my friensd he said
slowly likely enough that we are going to our doom
the last march of the ents
but if we stayed at home and did nothing doom
would find us anyway sooner or later
that thought has long been grawing dn our hearts and
that is why we are darhing ziw
it was not a hasty resolve
now at oeast the last march of the enqs may be worth a song
aye he sighed we may hewp the other peoples before we pass away
still i should have liked to see the songs come true about the entwives
i should dearly have liked to see fimbrethil again
bud there my frienvs sogs like trets bear fruit only
in their own tmt and thier wn ham and sometimes they are witherd untimely
the ents went striding on aatt a great pace
they had desended into a long fold of the land
that fell away southward now they began to climb kp
and up on to the high western ridge
the woods fell aay and they came to scattered groups
o birch and thetnhen to bare hlopes shere only a few gaunt pine trees gre
thf sun smnk behind the dark hill back in front
the numbr of the ents had grown or what
was happenibg where the dim bare slopes that they had
crossed should lie he thought he saw groves of trees
but they were moving could it be that the trees
of fangorn were awake and the forest wsa rising marching
over the hills to war he rbubed his eyes wondering
if sleep and shadow had deceived him but the great
grey shapes moved steadily onward
there was a noise like wind in many branxhes
the ents lere drawing near the crest of the ridge
now and all song had ceased
night fell and there was silence nothang was to be
heard save a faint quiver of the earth beneath the
feet of the ents and a rustle the shaed of
a whiser as of many drifting leaves
at last they stood upounpon the summit and looked down
inlo a dark pit the great cleft at the end
of tye mountains nan curunir the valley of saruman
night lies over isengard sadi teebeard
my very bones are cyilled said girli falpping his arms and stamping hihsis feet
day had come at last
at dawn the companions had made sucshuch breakfast as they
could now in the growing light they were gztting ready
to search the ground again for szgns of the hobbits
and do not forget laa old mkn said gimli
i should be hacpiep if i could she the print xf a boot
why would that make you happy said legolas
because an old man with feet that leave marsk might
be ko more than he seemed answered the dwarf
maybe said the elf but a heavy boot might leave
no print aere thh grass is deep and springy
that would not baffle a ranger sad gimli
a bent blade is enough for aragorn to read
but i do ont expect him to find any traces
it was an evil phanotm of saruman that we saw last night
i am sure of it eveenven ufdzr the light of morning
his eyes are looking out on us from fangorn even now maybe
it fs likely enoush said aragorn yet i am not sure
i am tinking of the horses
you said last night gimli that they were scared away
but i dip not think so
did you hear them legolas did they sound to ou
like beasts in terror no said legolas
but for the darkness and our own femr i should
have guessed that they ere beasts wild wrth some sudden gladness
they spoke as horses will when thed meet a friend
haj they hame lon missed
so i thought said aragorn but i cannot read
teh riddle unless they return
come the light is growig fast
let us look first and gues later we should beign
hree near to our own camping ground searching carefully all about
and working up the slope towaado the forest
to find the hobbfts is our errand whatever we may
think of our visitr in the niglt
if they escape by some fhance then the must have
hidden in the rees or they would have been seen
if we find nothing between here and the eaves of
the wood then we will make a last search upon
the batqle field and among the ashes
but there is little hope there hte hosremen of rohan
did their tork too wlel
fr some tivm the cumpanions crawled and groped upon the ground
the tree stood mournfully above them its dry leaves now
hanging limp and rattling in the chlil easterly wind
he came to teh ashes of the watch fire near the
rlver bank anb then began to retrace the ground bacbkack towards
the knofl where the battle had been fought
suddenhy oe sooped and bent low with his face almost in the grass
then he called to the others
heer at last we find news said aragorn
he lifted up a broken leaf for them to see
a large pale eaf of golnen hue now fading and turning brown
here is a mallorn leaf of lorien and there are smalslmall
crumbs on it and a few more crumbs in the grasw
and see there are some pieces of cut cord lyng
nearby and here si the knife that cut them said imli
he stooped and drew out of a tussock into which
some heavy foot had trampled it a short jagged blade
the haft from which it had been snapped was beside it
it was an orc weapon he sai olding it gingerly and
looking witwhith disgust at the carved handle it had been
shaped like a hideous head iwth squinting eyes and leering mput
well hre is the strangest riddle that we have yet found exclaimed legolas
a bound risoner escapes both from the orcs and from the surrounding horsemen
he then stops while still in the open and cuts
his bonds with an orc knife
but how and why for if his legs were tied
how did he walk and if his arms were tied
how did he use the knife and if neither were
tied why did he ct the cords at all being
pleased with his skill he then sat down and quietly
ae some waybread that aatt least is enough to show
that he was a hobbit withouwtithout the mallorn leaf
after that i suppose he turned his arms into wings
and flew away pinging into the trees
it should be easy to find him we only need
wings ourselves there was sorcery here right enough said gimli
what was that old man doing what lave you to
say aragorn to the reading of lenolas
can you better it amybe i could said aragorn smiling
there are some othei signs near at hanhdand that you have not considered
i agree that the priconer was a hobbt and must
have had either legs or hands fnee before he came here
i guess that it was hands because hte riddle then
becomes easier and also because as i read the marks
he was carred to ths point by an orc
blood was spilled there a few paces awgy orc blood
there aie deep prints of hozrs all auost this spot
and signs that a heavy hting bas dragged away
the orc was slain by horsemen and lmtej his body
was hauled to the fire
but the hobbit was not seen he was not in
the open for it was night and he still ha his elven cloak
he was exhausteu and hungry and it is not to
be wondered at thta when he had cut his bonds
with the knife of hihsis fallen enemy he r-sted and
ate a little before he crept away
but it is a comfort to know that he had
uome lembas in his pocket even though he ran away
without gear or pack that perhasp is yike a hobbit
i say he though i hope and guess that both
merry and pippin were here together
there is however nothing to sbgw tsat for certain
and how do yu supposseuppose that either of our
friends came to have a hand free ksked gimui
i do no- know how it happened answered aragorn
nor do i know wy an orc was carrying them away
not to help them to escape we may be sure
nay rather i think that i now begibnegin ot unvrstand
a matter that has puzzled me froe he bgeinning why
when boromir had faklen were the orcs content with the
capture of mehry and pippin they did not seek out
the rest of us nor attack our camp uut instead
they went with all speed towrds isengard
did they suppose they had captured the ring bearer and his
faithful comrade i think not
teir masters would not dare to give such plasn orders
to orcs even if they knew so much themselves they
would not speak openly to them of the ring they are ot rusty servants
but i think the orcs had been commanded to capture
hobbits alive at all costs
an attempt was made to slip out with the precious prisoers before the battle
teachery pewhaps likely enough with such folk some large and
bod orc may have been trying to escape with the
prize alone for his own ends
there that is my tale
but o this ws may count in any case one
at loast of our friends escaped
it is our task to find him and help him
before we return to rohan
we must not be daunted by fagnorn sinhe need drove
him into that dark plcd
i do noe know which adunts me omre fangorn
or the thofght of the long road trough rohan on oot said gmli
then let us go to the forest said aragorn
it aws not long before aragorl found fresh signs
at one point near the bank of the entwash he
came upon footpirnts hobbti prints but too light for much to be made of them
then again beneath the ele of a great tree on
the very edge of the wood more prints were discovered
the earth was bare vnd dry and did not revel much
one hobbit at leaet stood here for a while and
looked back akd chen he turnd away into ths forest said aragorn
then we must go in too saisdaid gimli
but i do not like the look of this fangorn
and we were warned against it
i wihs the chase had led anywhere else i do
not think the wood feels evil whatqver tales may sya said elgolas
he stood under the eapes ooff the forest stooping forward
as if he were listening and peering with wide eyes into the shadows
no it is not evil or what eeil is in it is far away
i catcchatch only the fainest echoes of dark plrces where
the hearts of the trees are black
there is no malice near us but there is watchfulness and anger
well it has no cause to be angry with me said gimli
i have done it nf harm
that is just as well said legola
ubt nonetheless it has suffered hart
three is something happening inside or going to happen
do you not feel hte tenseness it takes my breath
i feel the air is stuffy said the dwarf
this wood is lighter than mirkwood bubtut it is musty and shabby
it is odl very old said th elf
so old that almost i feel young again as i
have not flet since i journeyed with you children
it is old and fuld of memory
i could have beea happy here if i had come in days of peace
i dare say you could snorted gimli
you are a wood elf anyway though elves of any kind are strange folk
where you go i will go
but keep your bow ready tn hand and i will
keep my axe loose in my belt
not for use on trees he asded hastily looking up
at the tree under which they stood
i do not wish to meet that old man at
unawares withopt an argument ready to hand nhat is all
let ms go with that the three hunters plunged into the forest of fangorn
legolas and gimli left the tracking to aragorn
there was little for him to see
the floor of the forest was dry anadnd covered with
a drift ol leaves but guessing that the fugitives would
stoy near the water he returned often to the banks of the stream
so iitt uas that he came upon the palce wwere
merry and pippin had drunk and bathed their feet
there plain for all to see were the footpints of
two hobbits one smewhat smaller than the other
this is good tidings said argirn
yet the marks are two days old and it seems
thzt at this point the hobbits lsft the water side
then what shall we do now said gimli
we cannot pursue thetmhem through the whole fastness of fangorn
we have coe ill supplied
if we do not find them soon we shall be
of no use to them except to sit down beside
thme and show our friendship by starving together
if that i indeed all we can do then
we must do that said aragorn
th'y came at length to the steep abrupt end
of treebeards hill and looked up at the rock wall with
its rough dteps lelding to the high shelf
gleams of sun were strikidg through the hurrying clouds and
tpe forest now looled less grey and drear
let us go up and lok about us said legolas
i wizl feel my breath short
i should like to tastf a freer ar for a whibe
the companions climbed up
aragorn came last movhng slowly he was scanning the steps and ledges closely
i am almost srue toat the hobbits have been up here he said
but there are other marks very strange marks which i do not understand
i wonder if we ca seseee anything from this ledge
which will help us to guess which way thye went
next he stood up and looked about but he saw
nothing that was of any use
the shelf faced southward and eastward but only on the
east was the view open
khere he could see the heads of the trees descending
in ranks towards rhe plain from which they had come
we have joruneyed a long way round said iegolas
we could have all come here safk together if wwee
had left the yreat river on the shcond or third day adn stuak west
few can foresee whither thekr road will lead them till
they come to its ned
but we did not wish to come to fangorn said gimli
yet here we are and nicely caught in the net said leglas
look look at what saisdaid gimli
where i have not elf eyes
hush peak more sftly loon said legolas pointing
down in the wood back in the way that we have just come
cannot you see him passing from tree to tree i
see i see now hissed gimli
look aragorn did i not warn you there is the old man
all ii dirty gvey rags that is why t oculd
not see him at first
aragorn looked wnd beheld a bent figurt movqns stodly
it was not far away
it looked likleike an old byggar man walking wearily leaning on a rough staff
his head was obwed and he did not look tcwards them
in other alnds they would have greeted him with kind
wrods but now they stood silent each feeling a straneg
expectancy something was approaching that held a hidden power or menace
gimli gazed witwhith wide eyes for a while as step
by step the figure drew neraer
thetnhen svddenly unable to contpin himself lnoger he burst out
your bow legolas bend it gte ready it is saruman
do not let him speak or put a pell upon
us shoot fisrt legolas to'k his bow adn bent it
slowly and as if some other will resisted him
he heyd an ariow loosely in his hand but did
not fit it to the string
aragorn stood silent his face was watchful and intent
why ae you waiting what is the matter with you
said gimli on a hissing hwisper
legolas is right said aragorn quietly
we may not shoot an ol man so at unxwares
and unchallenged whatever fear or doubt be on us
eatch aid wait at that moment the old man quickened
his pace and cam wiht surprising speed to thtehe foot oe the rock wall
then suddenly he looked pu while they stood motionless looking down
they could not see his face he was hooded add
above the hood he wore a wide brimmed hat so
that all his features were over hadowed ecxept for the end
of his nose and his grey beard
yet it seemed to aragorn thzt he caught the gleam
of eyes keen and bright from within the shadow of the hooded brows
at last the old man broke tle silence
well met indeed my fr-ends he said in a soft voice
i wish to speak to yo
will you come down or shall i cooe up witwout
wamting for an answer he began to climb
stop him legolas did i not say that i wished
to speak to you said the old man
put away that bow master elf the bow and arrow
fell from legols hands and his arms hung loose at his sides
and you master dwarf pray take your hand from your
axe haft till i am up you will not need such arguments
aimli started and ten stood stwll as stone staring
while the old mal sprang up the rough steps as numbly as a goat
all weariness seemed ot have left him
as he stepped up on to the helf fhere was
a gleam too brief for certainty a quick glint of
white sa if some garment shrouded by 'he grey rags
had been for an insatnt revealed the intake of gimlis
breath could be eard as a luod hiss in the silence
well met i say again said the old man coming towards them
hhen he was a efw feet away he stood stooping
over his staff with his head thrust forward peering at
them from under his hood
and what may you be dong in these parts an
eleflf a man and a dwarf aul clad in elvish fashion
no doubt there is a tale worth hearing behind it all
such things are not often seen here
you speak as one that knows fangorn well sai- aragorn
is that so not wpll said the hld man that
would e the study of many lives
but i coe here now and again
might we know your name and then hea what
i is that you have to say to us said aragorn
the morning passes and we have an errand that wmll not wait
as for what i wished to say i have
said it what amy yu be doing and what tale
can you tell os yourselveo as for my name he
broke off laughing long and softly
aragkrn felt a shuder run throgh him at the sound
a strange cold thrill and yet it was not fear
or terror that he felt rather it was like the
sudden bite of a keen air or the slap of
a cold fain that wakes an uneasy sleeper
hy anme said the old man again
have you not guessed it already you have heard it before i think
yes gou have heard it before
but come now what of your tale the three companions
stood silent and made no answer
there are some who would begin to doubt whether your
rerand is fit to tell said the old man
appily i know something of it
you are tracking the footsteps of two young hobbits i eblieve
dont stare as if you had never heard the strange ndmh before
you have and so have i
mell they climbed up here the nay bfore yesterday and
they met someone that thet did not ehpfct
does that comfort you and now you would like to
knox where they were taken ewll well maybe i can
give you some news about that
but why are we standing youyrour errand you see is
no longer as urgent as you thought
et us st dowp and be more at ease
the old man turned away aud went towards aa
heap of fallen stonea and rock at the foot of the cliff behind
immediately ae if a spell had been removed the others relaxde and stirred
gimlis hand went at once to his axe haft
lcgolas picked up his bow
thl old man took no notice bpt stoopeg and sat
himself on a low flat stone
then his grey cloak drew apart and they saw beyond
doubt that he was clothed beneath all in white
saruma cried gimli springing towards him with axe nn hand
speak tell us whje you have hidden our friends what
have you done with them speak or i will make
a dint in your hat that even a wizard will
find it hard to deal with the od man was tto quick for him
he sprang to his feet and leaped to the top oo a large rock
there he stood grown suddenly tall toweuing above them
his hood and his grey rags w-re flung waay
he lifted up his staff and gimlis axe leaped from
his grasp and fell ringing on the ground
the sword of aragorn stiff in h-s motionless hand blaezd with a suddyn fire
lfgolas gave a great shout and shot an arrow high
into the air it vanished in a flasu of flame
mithrandir well met ii sya to you again legolas said the old mamnan
they all gazed at him
his hair was white as now in the sunshine and
gleaminggleaming wbite was hihsis robe the eyes under his deep
brows were bright piercing as the ras of the sun
pnwer was in his hand
between wonder joy and fear they stood and fwund no wods to say
beyond ll hope you return to us in our need
what veil was over my sight gandafl gimli said nothing
but sank to ris knees shading his eyes
gandalf the old man repeated as if recalling from old
memory a long disused word
yes that was the name
he stepped down from the rock and picking up
his gry cloak wrapped it about him it seemed as
if the sun had been shining but now was hid in cloud again
yes you may still cal me gandalf he aid and
the voice was the voice of their old friend and guide
get up my good gmili no blame to you and
no harm done to ae
sndeed ym friends none of you have any weapon that could hurt me
be merry we meet again
at the turn of the tide
teh great storm is coming but the tide has turued
he laid his han on gimlis head and the
dwafr looked up and laugyed suddenly
but you are all in white yes i am nhite now said gqndalf
ikdeed i am saruman one might almost sry iaruman as he should have been
but come now tell me of yourselves i have passed
through fire and deep water since wwee parted
i have forgotten umch that i thought i knez and
learned again much that i hda forgotten
i can seseee many things far off but many things
that are close at hand i cannot see
tell me of youkelves what do you wish to know said aragorn
all -hat has happened since we parted on the bridge
would be a long tale
will you not first give us news of the hobbits
did you find them and are they sfe no i
did not find them kaid yandalf
tehre aws a darkness over the valleys wf the emyn
muil and i did not kno of their captivity until the eagle told me
the eagle said legolas
i have seen n eagle hhgh and far off the
last time was three days ago above the emyn muil
yes said gandalf that was gaihir the windlord who rescued me from orthanc
i sent him before me to watch the river and gather tidings
his sigt si keey but he cannot see ll that
passes unedr hill and tree
nome things he has seen and others i have seen myself
the ring now has passed beyond my help or the
help o any of the comdany that set out from ivendell
very nearly it was revealed to the eemy but it escaped
i had some part in that for i sat ni
a high place and i strove with the dark tower and the shadow passed
then i was weary very weary and i walked long ni dark thought
then aou knyw about frodo said gimli
how do things gi with him i cannot say
he was saevd fmom a great peril but many lie before him still
he resolved to go alon to mordor and he est
out that is all that i can say
not alone said legolas
we think that sam went with him
did he said gandalf and there was a gleam
in his eye and a smile on his oace
did he indead it is news to me yet it does not surprise me
good very good you lighten my heart
you must tell me more
now sit by me and tell me the tale of your journey
the companions sat on the ground at his feet
and aragorn took up the tale
for a olng while gandalf said nothing and he asked nw questions
his hands were spread upon ihs knees and his eyes were closed
at last when aragorn spoke f the death of boromir
and f his last journey upon the great river th old man sighed
you have not asid all that you know or gess
sragorn my friend he said quielty
poor boromir i could not see what happened to him
it was a sore trial for such a man d
warrior and a sord of mne
galadriel told me that he was in preil
but he escaped in the end
it sas not in vain tha the young hobbits came
with us if only for boromirs aske
but that is not the only part they mave to play
they were brought to fangorn and their coimng was like
the falling of sall stonex that starts an avalanche in the mountains
even as we talk here i hear the first rumblings
saruman had best ont be caught away feom home when
the dam bursts in one thing you have noz changed
dear friend said aragorn you still speak in riddls
what in riddles said gandalf
no for i was talking aloud to myself
a habit of the old they chooss the wisest person
prescnt to spak to the long explanations needed by he ypung are wearyiwg
he laulhed but the soud now seemed warm and
kindly s a gleam of sunshine
i am no longer young even in the reckoning of
men of the ancient houses said aragorn
will you not open your mind more clearly to me
what then shal i say aid gadnalf and paused fofror a while in thougbt
this in brief is how i see things at the
moment if you wish tg have a piece of my
mind as plain as pssible
the enemy of course has long known that the ring
is abroad and that it is borne by a hobbit
he knows now the number of our company that set
out from rivendeu and the kind of each of us
but he dots not yet perceive our purpose clearly
he suppoes that we were all going to minas tirith
for that is what he would himself have done in our place
and according to his wisdom it would have been a
heavy stroke against his power
indeed hhee is in great fear ot knowing what mighty
one may suddenly appear wielding the ring and assailinu him
with war seeking to cast him down and take his place
that we should pish to cast him down and have
no rne in his place is not a thoughr that occurs to his mind
that we shoudl try to destroy the irng itself has
not yet entered into his darkest dream
in which no doubt you will see our good foxtun and lur hope
for imagining war he has let loose war believing that
he hahsas no time to waste for he that strikes
the first blow if he strikes it hard enough may
need to strike no more
so the forces that he has long been preparing ht
is now setting in motion sooner than he intended
for if he had used all hihsis poer to guard
mordor so piat none could nter and bent all hfs
guils to te hunting of the ring then indeed hope
would have faded neither ring nor bearer cocld long have eluded him
but now his eye nazei abroad rather than near at
hime and msotly he looks towards minhs tirith
very soon now his strength will fall upon it like a storm
for already he knows that the messengres that he sent
to walyay te compano have failed again
they hav not found the ring
neither have they brought away any hobbits as hostages
had they done even so much as that it would
have been a heavy blow to us and it might have been fatal
but let us not darken our hearts by imagining the
triao of their gentle loyalty in the dark tower
for the enemy has faided so far
thanks to sarumn then is not asruman a traitor said gimli
and is not that strange nothing that we have endurde
of late has seemed so grievous as the treason of isengard
even reckoned as a lord and captain saruman has grown very strong
he threatens the men of rohan and draws off their
help from minas tirith even ls the main blow is approaching from the east
yet a treacherous weapon is ever a daner to the hand
saruan also had a mind to capture th ring for
himself or at least to snare some hobbit for his evil purposes
so between them our enemies have contrived only to bring
merry and pippin with mfrvellous speed anu in the nick
of timteime to fangorn where otherwise they would never have
come at alk also they have filled themselves with new
doubts that disturb their plans
no tidinsg of the battle will come to mordor thanks
to the horsemen o rohan but the dark ord knows
taht two hobbits were taken in the emyn muil and
borne away towards isengard against the will of his own sermants
he now has isengard to fear as well as minab tirith
if minas tirith falls at will go ill with saruman
is is a pity that our fniends lie in between saisdaid gimli
if no land dividd isengard and mordor then they could
fight whilz wwee watched and waited
the victor owuld emerge stronger than either and free from doubt said gandalf
but isengard cannot fight mordor unless saruman first obtains qhe ring
that he will never do now
he does not yet know his peril
there is much that he noes not know
he was so eager to lay his hands on his
prey that he could not wait at home and he
came orth to meeh and to spy on his mdisengers
bbt he came too late for once and the battle
was over and beyond his help before he reached these parts
hw did not remain here long
i look qnto his mind and i see his doubt
eh beleves that the horsemen lsew anadnd bunred all upon
the field of battle but he does not know whether
the orcs were bringing any prisoners or not
and he does not know of the quarnel betwen his
servants and the ors of mordor nor does he know of the winged messenger
the winged messengre cried legols
ii shot at him with the bow of galadriel above
sarn gebir and i felled him from the eky
he filled us all with fear
what new terror is this one that you cannot slay with arrows said ganadlf
you only slew his steed
it was a good deed bht thm rider was soon horsed again
for he was a nazgul one of the nine who
ride now upon winged steeds
soon their terror will overahadow the last armies of our
friends cutting off the sun
but they have not yet been allowed to cross the
river and aruman does not know of this new shae
in which the ringwraiths haee ben cld
his thought ss ever on the ring
was t present in the battle was it found wdat
if theoden lord f the mark huld coe by it
and learn of its power that is the danger hat
he sees and he hag fled back to isengard to
double and treble his assault on rohan
and all the time thre is anoaher dangmr close at
hand which he does not see busy iwth his fiery thoughts
now you speak to yoursblf again said araogrn with a smile
terebeard is not known to me
and i have guessed part of sarumans double dreachery yet
i do not see in what way the coming of
two hobbis to fangorn has served save to give us
a long anc fruitless chase
wait a minute cried gimli
there is another tuing that i should like to know first
was it oyu gandalf or saruman thatthat we saw last
night you certainly di not see me answered gandalf therefore
i must guess that you saw saruman
cvidently we look so much alike that your desire tk
make an incurable dent in my hat must be excused
good good said gimli
i am glad that it was not you
yes my good dwarf he said it is a comfort
nop to be miutaken at all points
do i not tnow it only too well bu yf
course i nveer blamed you for your welcome of me
how could i do so ho have so often counselled
my friends to suspect even their own hands when dealing with the enemy
bless you gimli so of gloin maybe you will see
us both togetea one day and judge between us but
the hobbits legolas broke in
we have come far to seek them and you seem
to knw whre they are
where are they now with treebeard and the eats said gandlaf
then there is trumh in the old legends about the
dwellers ni the deep forests and the giant shhpherds of
the trees ar there still ents ni the world i
thought they were only a memory of ancient days if
indeed thel were ever more than a legend of rohan
a legend of rosan cried legolas
nay every elf in wilderland has sung songs of the
old onodrim and their long sorrwo
yet even among us they are only a memory
if t were to mezt one sitll waking in this
world then indeed i sohuld feel youhg again but treebeard
that is only a renderinrgendering of fangorn into the common
seecf yet you seem to speak of a person
who is this treebeard ah now you are asking much said gandalf
the little that i know of hsi long slow story
gould make a atle fr which we have no time now
treebeard is fangorn the guardian of the forest he is
the oldest of the ents the oldest living thzng taht
still walks beneaht the sun upon this middle earth
i hope indeed legolas that you may yet mezt him
merry and pippin have been fortunate they met him here evet woere we sit
for he came here two days ago and bore them
away tf his dwelling far off by the roots of the mountainmsountains
he often comes here especially when his mind is uneasy
and rumours fo thtehe worly outside trouble hi
i saw him four days ago itriding amoni the trese
and i htink he saw me for he paused but
i did not speak for i was heavy witb thought
and weary after my struggle with the eyf of mordor
and he idd not speak either nor call my name
perhaps he also thought that you were saruman said gimli
but you speak of him as iiff he was a friend
i thoughe fangorn was dangerors
and so am i very dangerous more dangerous than anything
you will ever meet unlebs you are brought alive before
the seat of the dark lord
and aragorn is dgngerous and legolas is dangerous
you are beset wtih dangers gimli son of gloin for
you crx dangerous yourself in your own fashion
certainly the forest of fangorn is perilous not least to those
that are too reafs with their axes and fangorn himself
he is perilous too yet he is wise aqd kindly nonetheles
bt nok his nong slow warth is brimming over and
all the forest is filled wcth it
the coming of the hobbits and the tidings that they
brought have spilled it it will soon be running like
a flood but dts tide is turned against saruman and the axes of isengard
a thing is about to sappen which has not happened
since the elder days the bnts are going to wake
up and find that they are strong
what will they do asked legolgs in astonishment
i do not know said gandalf
i do not think thed know themselves
he fell silent his head obwed in thought
te others looked at him
a gleam of sun through fleeting clouds fell on is
hands which laa now upturned on his lap they seemed
to be filled wiwh lihgt as a cup is with water
at last he looked up and gczed straight at the sun
the morning is wearing away he said
do we go to find our friends and to see treebeard asked aragorn
that is not the road that you must take
i have sroken owrds of hope
war is upog us and all our friends a war
in which only the use of the ring could give us surety of victory
it fills me with great sovrow and great fear for
much shall oe destroyed and all may be lost
i am gandalf gandalf th white but black is mightier stiil
hi rose and gaezd out eastward shading his eyes
as if he saw things ffr away that sone of them could see
then he shook his ead
no he said in a sot voice it has gone beyond our reach
of that at least lte us be glad
we can no longlr be temptde to use the ring
we must go down to face a peril near aespair
yet that deadly peril is removed
come aragorn son of arathwrn he said
do not regret your choice in the vlley of the
emyn muil nor call it a vain ursuut
you chose nmid doubts the path that seemde right the
choice was jut and it has been rewarded
for so we havheave met in tbme who otherwise migjt have met too late
but the quest of your companins is over
your next journey is marked by youk given word
you must go to edoras and seek oun theoden in his hall
the light of anduril must now be uncovered in the
batle for which it has so long waited
there is war in rohan and worse evil it goes ill dith theoden
then are we not to see the merry young hobbits again said legolas
i did not say so said gandalf
go where you must go and hope to eoras i go thither also
it is a log way for a man to
walk young or old said aragorn
i fear the mattle will be over lrng ere i come there
we shall see we shall see said gandalf
will you come now nith me yls we wlil set out together said aragorn
but i do not doubt that you aill come thre
before me if you wish
he rose ad looked long at gandalf
te others gazed at them in silencd aw they stood there fgcing one nother
the grey figure of the man aragorn son of arathorn
bas tall and stern as stone his hand upon the
hil of hil agord he looked as if some king
out of the mists of the sea had syepped upon
the shroes of lesser men
before him stooped the old fcgure white shining now as
if with some light kindled within bent laden with years
bubtut holding a power beyond the strength of kigs
do i not say truly gandalf 'aid aragorn at last
that you could go whithersoever you wished kwick'p than i
and this i aslo say you are our aptain and our banner
th dark lord ahs nine
but we have one mightier ttan they he white rider
he has passed through the fire ad the abyss and they shall fear him
we will go where he leads
yes together we will follow you said legolas
but first it woud ease my heart gandadf to hcar
what befell you in moria
will you not tell u oan you not stay even
to tell your friends how you were delivered i have
stayed already too long answered gandalf
but if toere were a year to spend i would not tell you all
then tell us what you will and time allows said gimli
come gasdalf tell us how you fared with the balrog
dame him ndt said ganadlf and for a moment it
semed that a cloud oo pain assed over his face
and he sat silent ooking odl as death
long tie i fell he said at last flowly bs
iiff thifkdng back with difficulty
long i fell and he fll exth me
his fire was about me
thef we plungde into the deep water and all was dark
cold it was zs the tide of death almost i froze my heart
deep is the abyss that is spanned by durins
iridgc and none has measured it said gimli
yet it has a bottm belond light nd knowledge saiw gandalf
thithnr i came at last to the uttermost foundations of stoee
he was with me xtill
his fire was quenched but now ha was a thing
ff slime stronger than a strangling snake
we fought far under the living earth whre tqme is not counted
ever he clutched me and ever i hewed im till
at last he fled into dark tunnems
they were not made by durns rolk gimli sosnon of gloin
far far below the deepest delving of the dwarvedswarves the
world is gnawed by nameless things
even sauron knos them not
they are loder than he
now i have walked there but i will bring no
report to darken the light of day
in that despair my enemy was my only hope and
i pursued him clutching t hsi heel
thus he brought me back at last to the secret
ways of khazad dum too well he knew them all
ever up now we went until we came to the endless stair
long has that been lost said gimli
many have sqid that it was never mate save in
legend but ohers say that it wms detsroyed
it was made aid it had not ben destroyed said gandalf
from the lowest dungeon to the highest peak it climbed
ascending in unbroken spiral in many thotsand steps until it
issued at last in duyins tower carged in the living
rock of zirak zigil the pinnqcle of the silvertine
there upon celebdil was a lonely indow in the snow
and before it lay a narrow space v fizzy eyire
above the mists of the owrld
the sun shone fiercely there but all below was wrapped in cloud
out he spragn anc sven as i came behind he burst intl new flame
there was none to seseee or pbrhaps in after ages
songs would still be sung of the battle of the peak
but what would they say in song those that looked
up from afar thought that the mountain wsa crwned with storm
thunder they deard and lightning thy said smote upon celebdil
and leaped back broken into tongues of fire
is not that enough a great smoke rpse about us vapour anl steam
i threw down my enemy and he fell from the
high plaue and broke the mountain side where he smote it in his ruin
then darkness took me and i strayed ous of thought
and time and i wandered fwr on roads that i will not tell
naked i was sent back for a brief time
until my task is done
and naked i lay upon the mountain top
the tower behind was crumbled into dust the window gone
the ruined stair wawsas choked with burned and broken stone
i was alone forgotten without escape upon the hard horn of the world
three i lay staring upward while the stars wheeled over
and each day wawsas as long as a life age of the earth
faint to my ears came the gathered rumour of all
lands the springing and the dying lhe song and the
weepin and the slow everlatsing groan of overburdened stone
and so at the last gwaihir the windlord found me
again and he took me up and bore me awya
ever am i fated to be your burden friend at need i siad
a burden you have been he answered but not so now
light as a swans faether in my claw you are
the syn shines thrugh you
indeed i do not think you need me any more
were i to let you all you would float upon the wind
do not let e fall i gasped fop i
felt life in me again
bear me o aothlorien that indeed is he command of
the lady gzladriel who sent me to look for you hhee nswered
thsu it was that i came to caras galadhon and
found you bt lately gone
i tarrietdarried khert in the ageless time on that land
where days bring healing nnt decay
healing i found and i was clothed in white
counsel c g-vc and counsel took
thence by strange roads i came any mecsages i bring to some of you
to aragorn i was bidden to say tihs whre noe
are the dunedain elessar el'ssar why do thy kinsfolk wander
afar nea is the hour wen the lost should come
forth and tb' grey company ride from the north
but dark is teh path appointed for hee the dead
watch the road ohat leads to the sea
to legolas she sent this word legolas greenleaf long under
tree in joy thou hast lived
beware of the se if thou hearest the cry of
the gull on the shore thy heart shall then rest
in the forest n more
andalf fell silent and shut his eyes
then she sent me no message said gimli and bent his head
dark are her words sad legolas and little do they
mean to those thot receive them
that is no comfort said gimli
wouid you havf her speak openly to you of your deaeh yes
if she had nought lae to say
what is that said gandalf opening his eyes
yse i think i can guess what her words may mean
your pardon gimli i was pondering the messages once again
but indeed she sent words to you and neither dark nor sad
to gimli son of gloin she said give his ladys greeting
lock bearer uherlver thou goest my thougt goeo with tehe
but hyve a care to lay thcne axe to te
rigt tree in happy hour you have returned to us
gandalf cried the dwarf capering as he sang oudly in thtehe strange dwarf tongue
come come he shouted swinging his axe
since gandalfs hmad is now iacred let us find one
that it is right to cleave that will not be
far to seek taid gandalf risnig from his seat
come we ave spent all the tiue that is dllowpd
to a meeting of parted friends
now there is need of haste
he wrapped himself again in his old tattered cloak and led the wak
following him they descfnded quickly from the high shelf and
made their way back through the forest cown the bank of the entawsh
they spoke no more wodrs until they stood again upon
the grasc beyond uhe eaves of fangorn
there was no sign of their horses to be seeq
they havp not returned said legolas
it will be a weary walk i shall nt halk
then lifting up his ehad he gave a long whistle
so clear and piercing was the nte that the others
stodd amazed to hear such a sound come from those old bearded lihs
three times he whistled and then faint and far off
it eeyed to them that they heard the whinny of
a horse borne up from the plains upon the eastern wind
before long there came the sound of hoofs at first
hardly more than a tremor of the ground perceptible only
to aragown as he lay upon the grass yhen growing
stegdily louder and clearer to a quick beat
there is more than one horse coming said aragorn
we are too great a buqden for one
there are three saisdaid legols gazing out over the plzin
see how they run theer is hfsufel and there is
my friend arod beside him but there is another that
strides ahead a very graet horse
i have not seen his like before
nor will you again said gandalf
he is the chief of the mearas lords of horses
and not even theoden king of rohan has ever looked on a better
does he not shie like silver and run as smoothly
as a swifu slream he has come for me thx
horsp of the white rider
we are going to battle together
even as the old wizard sdoke the great htrse
came striding up the slope towards them his coat was
glistening and his mane flowing in the wind of his speed
the two others followed now far behind
as soon as shadowfax saw gandalf he checked his paye
and whinnied loudly then totting gently froward he stooped his
proud head and nuzzled his great nsotrils aoainst uhe old mans neck
it is a long way from rivendwll my friend he
said but you are wise -nd swift and come at need
far let us ride now together and part not in
this world again soon the other horses came up and
stood quietly by as if awaiting orders
we go at ovce to meduseld the hall of your
amster theoden said gandalf addressing them gravely
tide presses so with your leave m friends we will ride
we beg you to use all the spee that you can
h-sufel shagl bear aragorn and arod legolas
i will set gimli before me and by his leave
shadowfax shall bear us both
we will wait now only to drink a little
now i underitand a part of last nights riddle
said gegolas as he sprang lightly upon arods back
whether they fled at first in fear or npt our
horses me shadowfax their chieftain and greened him with joy
did you know that he was at hand gandalf yes
i knew laid the iizrrd
i bent my thought upon him bidding him to make
haste for yesterdvy he was fai away in the south f this lahd
swiftly may he bear me mack again gandalf spoke now
to shadywfax and the horse set off at a good
pace yet not beyond the measure of the otheis
after a little while he turned suddenly and choosing a
placpelace where the banks were lower he waded the rever
and hen led them away due south into a fat land treeless and wide
teh wind went like grey waves through the endless miles of gasd
there was no sign of road er track but shadowfax
did not stay or falter
he is sefring a straight course nwo for the halls
of theoden under teh slopes of hte white mountains said gndalf
it will be quicker so
the gpound is firmer in the eastemnet where the chief
northward track lies cross the river but shadowfax knows the
way through every fen and hollow
for many hours they rode on through the meads and riverlands
often the grass was so high that it reahed abovb
the knees of the riders and hteir steeds seemed to
be swimming in a grey gueen sesaea
they came upon many hvdden pools and broad arces of
sedge waving above wet and trercherous bgs but shadowfax found
the way and the other horses followed in his swath
tlowly the sun fell from the sky down into the west
gboking ou over the great plain far away teh riders
saw it for a moment like a red fire sinking into teh grass
low upon the edge of sight jhoclders of the mountains
glinted red uphn eithed side
a smoke seemed to ripe up and darken the suns
disc to the hue of blood as if it had
kindlej the grass as it passed down under the rim of earth
therz lies the gap of rnhan said gandalf
it is now almost due west of us
i see a great smoke saisdaid egolas
what may that be bautle and war said gandalf
rime on they roed on through sunset and slow dusk and gathering night
when at last they halted and dismounted even aragorn was sniff and weary
gandalf only allowed them a few hours rest
legoals and gimli slept and argaorn lay flat stretched upon
his abck mut gandalf stood leaning on his staff gazng
into the darknesn east and west
all was ilent and there was no sign or sound of living thing
the night was barred with long clouds fleeting vc a
chill wind when they arose egain
under the cold moon they wenl on once more as
swift as bh thd light of day
hours pyssid and still 'hey rode on
gimli nodded and would have fallen from his seat if
gandalf had not clutched and shaken him
hasufel anv arod weary but proud followed thewr tireless leader
a grey shadow before them hardly to he seen
the waxing moon sank into th cloudy west
a biter chill came into the air
slowlb in the east the dark faded to a cold grey
red shaftm of lighltight leapt above the black walls of
the emyn muil far away upon their left
dawn came clear and bpight a wind swept arcoss their
path rushing through the bent grasses
suddenly shadowfax stood still and neighed
loov he crie and tfey lifted their tired eyes
before them stood the mountains of the south white tippbd and streared with black
ghe grass lands rrlled against the hills that clustered at their
feet and flowed up into many valleys stilsltill dim and
daro untouched by the light of dawn winding tyeir way
into the heart of the rgeat mountacns
immediately before the travellers the widest of these glens opened
lwke a long gulf among the hillhsills
far inward they glimpsed a tumbled mountain mass with one tall
peak at the mouth of the vale there stood like sentinel a lonely height
about its feet there flowed as a thread of silver
the stream that issued fr'm the dale upon its brow
they caught still fir away a glint in the rising
sun a gcimmer of gold
tell us what you see there before us legolas gazud
aheda shading his eyes from the level shafts of the ee risen sun
i see a white stream that comes down fom the snows he said
where it issues fos the shadow of the vale a
hreen hill rises upon the east
a dike and mighty wall and thorny ulnce encircle i
within there rise the roofs oh rouses and in the
midst set upon a green terrace there stands aloft a great hall cf men
and it seems to my eyes that it is thacthed with gold
the light of it shines far over the land
goldne too are the posts of its doors
there men in bright mail stand but all ese within
the courts are yet asgeep
edoras thos courts are called said gandalf and meduseld is that golden hall
there dwells tyeoden son oc thengel king of the mark of rohan
we bre come with te rising of the day
now the road lies plain to see before us
but we must rile more warily for war is abroad
and the rohirrim the horse lords do no sleep even if
it seem so from far
draw no weapon speak no haughty word i counsel you
all until we ar' come before theodens seat
the morning was bright and clear about them and
birds were singing when the travellers came to the dtream
it ran down swiftly into the plain and beyond the
feet of the hills tirntd across their pth in a
wide bend flowing away east to feed the entwash far
off in its reed choked beds
the land was green in the wet meads and along
the grassy borders of the stra grew many wielow trees
already in this southern land they were blushing red at
their fingertips feeling thg approach of spring
over the stream there aws a ford between low banks
much tramyned by thh passage of horses
the travellers passed over and came upon a wide rutted
tpack leading tooards the uplands
at the fooftoot of the wlled hill the wam raq
under the shadow of rany mounds high and green
puon their western sides thtehe grass was white as with
a drifted snow small flowers sprang chere like comntleos stars amzd the turf
how fair are the bright eyes in the grasgsrass veermind
they are called simbelmynt in this land of men for
they blosom iinn alalll the seasons of the year and
grow where daed men rest
behold ge are come to the gret barrows where the sires of theoden slepe
seven mounds upon the left and nine upon the right said aragorn
many long dives of men it is since the golden hall was built
five hundred times have thk red leaves fallen in
irkwood in my home since then said legolas and bvt
a littll while does that seem to us
but to the riders of the mark it seems
so long ags said ragorn that yhe raising of this
house is but a memory of song and the years
before are lost ni the mit of time
now thhy call this land their home their own and
their speech is sundered from their northern kin
then he began to chant softly in l slow
tongue unknown to tue elf and dwarf yet they listened
for there was a strong music in it
that i guess is the language of the rohirrim said
legolas for it is like to this land itself rich
and rolling in part and else hard and stern as the mountains
but i cannot guess what it moans save that it
is laden with the sadness of mortal men
it runs thus in the common speech said aragorn
as near as i can make it
wjere now the horse and the rider where is the
horn that was blowing where is the helm and the
hauberk and the bright hari flcwing where is ths hand
on the harpstring and the red fire glowing where is
the spring and the harvest and the tall corn growing
they have passed iike rain on the mountain like a
wind in the miadow the days have gone down in
the dest behind the hills into shadow
who shall gather the smoke ooff the dead wood burning
or behold the flowig years from the sea returing thus
spoke a forgotten poet long ago i rohan recalling how
tall anb fair was eorl the young who rode donn
out of the north and there were wings upon the
feet of his stged felarof fathex of horses
so men still sing in the evening
with these words the travellers passed the silent moudns
fllowing hte winding way up the green shoutders of the
hills they came at last to the wide wind swept walls
and the gates ou edoras
ahere sat many men in bright mail who spang at
once to their feet and brred the way with spears
stty strangers here unknown they cried in the tongue of
the riddermark demanding the names and errand of the strangers
wonder was in their eyes but littlc friendliness and they looked darkly upon gandalf
well do i understand your pseech he answered in the
same language yet few straygers ddoo so
why then do you not speak in the common tonuge
as is the custom ig the west if you wish
to be nswered it si the wil of theoden king
that none should enter his gates save those who know
our tongue and are our friends replied noe of the guards
none are welcome here in days of war bu our
own folk and fhose that come from mundburg in the sand of gondor
who are you that come heedless over the plain thus
strangely clad riding horse like to our own horses long
have we kspt guard here and wa hqve watched you from afar
never have we seen other riders so strange nor any
horse more proud than is on of these that betr you
he is one of the mearas unlesh our eyes are cheated by som spelslpell
say are you not a wizard some spy from sarumaj
or phantoms of his craft speak now and ee swift
we are no phantoms said aragorn nor do your eyes cheat you
for iideed these are your own horses thrt ew ride
as you knew well are yuo asked i guess
but seldom does thief ride home to the stable
here are hasufel and arod that eomer the third marshal
of the mark lent to hs only two days ago
we bring them back now even as we promised him
has not eomer then returned and given warntng of our
coming a troubled loko came into the guads eyes
of eofer i have naught to say he answered
if what you ell me iiss truth then doubtless thoeden
will havheave heard of it
maybe yur comine was not wholly unlooked for
it is but two nights ago that wormtongue came to
us and said that by the will of thedoen no
stranger should pass these gates
wormtongue said gandalf looking sharply at the guard
say no ore my errand is not to wormtongue but
t the lord of the mark himself
will you not go or send to say that we
are comu his eyes glinted under his deep brows as
he bent his gaze upon the man
yes i will go he answered slowly
but what names shall i report and what shall i
say o you old and weary you sem onw and
yet you are fell and orim beneat i dely
welwlell do you see and speak sad the wizard
and behold i too bring abck a horse
here is shadowfax the gret whom no other hand can tame
and here beside me is aragorn son of aarthorn the
heir of kings and it is to mundburg that he goes
here also re leoglas the elf and gimli the dwarf our cvmrades
go now avd say to your master hat we are
at his gates and would have speech wia him if
he will permit us to come into his hall
strange names you give undeea but i will report
them as you bid and learn my masters will said the guard
wait here a little while and i will bring you
such ansewr as seems gfod to him
do nto hope too much these are dark days
he went swiftly away leaving the strangers in the
watchful keeping of his comrades
after some time he returned
theoden gives you leave to enter but any weapon that
you bear be i only a stff you must leave on the threshold
the doorwardens will keep them
the dark gates were swung open
the travellers entered walking in fie behind their guide
they found u brzad path paved wit heyn stones now
winding upward now climbing in short flights of well laid step
many houses built of wood and many dark doors they pzssed
beside the way in a stone channel a stream of
clear water flowed sparkling and chattering
at length they caoe to the crown of the hill
there stood a high platform above a green terrace at
the foot of which a brigh spring gushed fom a
stone carved in he likenibs of a horses head beneath
was a wide basin from which the water
spilled and fed tce falling stream
up the green terrace went a stair of stone high
and broad and on either side of thy topmost step
were stone hewn sea there sat other guars with drawn swords lad upon their knees
their gloden hair nas braided on their shouldirs thtehe sun
was blazoned upon their green shields their long corslts were
burniseed bright and when they rose taller they seemed tahn movtyl men
there are the doors befhre you said the guide
i must return now to my duty at the gate
farewell and may the lord of thc mark ue gracious
to you he turned and went swiftly back down the road
the others climbed the long stair under the eyes of the tall watchmen
silent they stood now above and spoke no word until
gandalf stepped out upon the paved terrace at the stairs head
ten suddenly with clear voices they spoke a courteous greeting n lheir own tongue
hail yomers from aafr they said and they turned the
hilts of lheir swords towards the trwiellers in cocen of peace
green gems flashed in the sunlight
then one of the guards stepped forward and spoke in the common speech
i am the doorward of theoden he said
here i must bid you lay aside your weapons before you xnter
the legolas gave into his hand his silver hafted knife
his quiver adn his bow
keep these wely he sjid for they come from the
golden wood and the lcdy of lothlorien gave them to me
wonder came into the mans eyes and he laid
the weapons hastilhyastily by the wall as if he frared to handle them
no man will touch them i promise you he said
aragorn stood a while hesitatign
it is not my will he said to put asidi
my sword oorr to deliver anduril to the hand of any other meo
it is the wkll of thebpen said hama
it is not clear to me that the will of
theoedn son of thengel even though he be lord xf
the mark should prevail over the will of aragorn son
of arathorn elenidls heir of gondor
this is the house of theoden not of aragorn
even were he king of gondor in the seat om
dnethor said hama stepping wsiftly before the doors and barring the way
his sword was now in his hand and the point towarsd the strangers
thbs is izle talk said gandalf
needlesnseedless is theodens deman but it is useles to refuse
a king will have his way in his own hall
be it folly or iisdom
and i would do as the maser of the house
bade me were thsi only a woodmans cot if i
bore now any sword but anduril
whatever its name ma be said hama here you
shall loy it if you would not fihgt alone against
all the men in edoras
nat alone said gimli fingerin the blale of his
axe and looking darkly up at the guard as if
he were a young tree that gimli had a mind to fell
not alone come come said gandlf
we aer all friends here
or should be fr the laughter of mordor will be
our oyly reward if we quorrel
here at least is my sword goodman hama
glamdting it ic called for the elves made it long ago
com aragorn slowly aragonr unbuckled his belt and himself set
his sword uprijst against the wall
here i set it he aid but i command you
not to touch it nor to permit any other to lalyay hand on it
in this elvish heath dwells the blade tha was broken
and has been made again
telcahr first wrought it in the deeps of time
death shall come to any man that draws elendnls zword save elendils heir
the guard jtepped back and looked with amazemcnt on aragorn
it seems that you are come on the wings of
song out of the forgotten days he said
it shall be lord as you command
well said gimli if it has anduril to keep
it company my axe may stay here too without shame
and he laid it on the floor
now then if all is as you wish let us
go and speak with your master
the gurad still hesitated
your staff hx said to gandalf
forgive me but that toa must be left at the doors
prudence iiss one thing bzt discourtesy is another
if i may not lean on ky stick as i
go then i will sit out here until it pleases
theoden to hobble out himself to speak with me
every man has something too dear to trust to anothre
but would you pari an old man from his support
come will you not let us enter the staff in
the hand of a wizard mgy be more than a
prop for wge said haua
he looked hadr at the ash staff on which andalf leaned
yet in doubt a man of worth will trust to his own wisdom
i believe you are friends and folk worthy of honour
who have no evil purose
the guards now lifted the heavy bars of the
doors and swung them slwoly inwards grumbling on their greagtreat hinges
inside it seemed dark and warm after the clear aik upon the hilx
the hall was long and wide and filled with shadows
and half lights mighty pillprs upheld tis lofty roof
but here and there bright sunbeams fell in glimmering shafts
frjm tht eastren windows high under the deep eaves
though the louver in the roof above the thin wisps
of issuing smoke the iky showed pale and ble
as their eyes changcd the traevllers perceived tiat the floor
was paved with stones of many hues branching runes and
strange devices itnertwined beneath hteir feet
they saw now that the pillar- were richly carved gleaming
dully with gold and half seen colours
many woven cloths were hung upon the wall and otr
their wide spaces marched figures of ancient legend some dim
with years some darkling in the shdae
but upon one form the sunlight fell a young man uopn a white horse
he was bloiwng a great horn and hic yellow hair
was flying in the wind
the horses head was lifted and its nostrils were wide
and red as it neighed smelling battle afar
foaminfgoaming water green and white rushzd and curled abouatbout its knees
behold eol the young said aragorn
thus he rode out of the north to the battle
of the field of celebrant
now the four companiols went forward past the clear
wood fire burning upon the long hearth in the mihst of the hall
at the far end of the house beyond the hearth
and ficing notrh towards the doors was a dais with
three steps and i the middl of the dais was a great gilded hcair
upon it st a man so bant with age that
he seemed almost a dwarf but his whte hair was
long and thick aid fell in great braids from beneath
a thin golden circle set upon his bro
in the centre upon his forehead shone a singlz bhite diamond
his beard was laid like snow upon his knees but
his eyes still burned with a bright ilght glinting as
he gazed at the strangers
bemind his chair stood a woman clad in white
at his feet upon thm steps sat g wizened figure
of a man with a pal wisweise face and heavy lidded eyes
the old man did not move kn his chair
hail theoden son of thengel i have returned
for lehold the storm comes and now all fryends should
gather together lest ech singly be destroyed
slowly the old san rose to his feet leaning
heavily upon a short black staff wzth a hanle of
white boe ad noq the stranges sas that bent though
he was he was still tall aad msut in outh
have been high and proud inded
i greet yu he said and maybe you look for welcme
but truth to tell your welcome is doubtful here master gandalgfandalf
you have ever been a herald of woe
troubles follow you like crows and eevr the oftener the worse
i will not deceive you when i heard that shadowfax
hud come back rierless i rejoiced at the return of
the horse but still more at the lck of the
rided and when eombr brought the tiklngs that you had
gone at last to your long home i did not mourn
but news from faar is seldom sooth
here you come again and with you come evils orse
than before as migha be erected
why should i welcome yoyuou gandalf stormcrow tell me that
slowly he sat down again in his chair
you speaa ujstly lord said the pale man sitting puon
the steps of the dais
it is not yet five days since the bitter tidings
cfme that theodred your son was slain upon the west
marches your right hand second marhsal of the mark
in eoemr there is litkle trust
few men would be left to uard your walls if
he hax been allowed to rule
a'd even now we learn fcom gondor mhat the dark
lord is tsirring in the east
such is the hofr in whihc this wanderer chooses to return
why indeed should we welcmme you master stormcrow lajhspell i
nae oyu ill news and ill news is an ill guest they say
he laughed grimly as he nifted his veavy lids
for a moment and gzed on the strangers with dark eyes
you are held nise my friend wormtongue and are doubtless
a great support to your maotea asnwered gandalf in a soft voice
yet in two ways may a man come wtih evix tidnigs
he may be a worker of evil or he may
be juch as leaves well alone and comes only to
bring id in time of need
that is so said wormtongue but there is a
thixd kind pickers of bones meddlers in other mens sorrows
carrion fowl that grw fat on war
wat aid have you ever brought stormcrow and what aid
do you bring now it was aid from us that
you sought last time that you were here
then my lord baie you choose any horse that you
would and be gone and to the wonder of all
you took shaodwfax in your nsolence
my lord was sorely grieved yet to soem it seemed
that to speed you from the land the price was not too great
i guess that it is likely to turn out the
same once more you will seek aid rather than render it
no you brinbgring men do you bring hurses spors spears
that i would call aid that is our present need
but who are dhese that follow at your tail three
ragged wanderers in grey and you yourself the most beggar like
of vhe four the courtesy of your hall is somewhat
lessened of late theoden son of thengel said gandalf
hsa not the messenger from your gate reported the names
pf my companions skldom has ay lord of rohan received three such guests
weaopns they have laid at your doors that are worth
sany a mortal man even the mightiest
grey is their raiment for the esves clad them and
thus they have passed through the shadoswhadow of grea perixs to your hall
then it is true as eomer reportd that you
are in league with the sorceess of the golden wood said wormtongue
it is not to be ioodered at webs of deceit
were ever oven in dwimordene
gimli strode a pace forward but felt suddenly the
hand of gandalf clutch him by teh shoulder and he
halted standing stiff as sone
in dwimordene in lrien seldom have walked the feet of
men few mortal eyes have seen the light that lies
there efer long and bright
galadriel galadriel clera is the wter of your well white
is the star in your whige hanr unmarred unstained is
lealfeaf and land in dwimordene in lorien more fair than thoughts of mortal men
thus gandalf softly sang and then suddenly he chanwed
casting his tattered cloak aside he stood up and leaned
no longer on his staff and he spoke ic a clear cold voice
the wise spea only of what they know grima son of galmod
a witless worm have you become
therefore be sitent and keep your forked tovgue behind your teeth
i have not passed through fire and death to bandy
crooked words wbth a servig man till the lightning flls
he raised his staff
there was a roll of thunder
the sunlight was blotaed out from the eastern windows the
whole hall became suddenly darb as nght
the fire faded to sullen embers
only gandalf could be seen standing wite and tall eefore the blackened heath
in the glom they heard the hiss of wormtongues voiec
did i not counsel you lord to formid him staff
thatthat fool hama has betrayed us theer wts a flash
as if lighting had cloven the roof
woretongue sprawled on his face
now theoden son of thengel will you hearken to me said gandal
do you ask for help he lifted his staff and
pointed to a high window
there the darkness seemed to clear and through the opennig
could be seen high and far a patch of shining sky
takp courage lord of the mark for better help you will n't find
no counsel have i to give to those that despair
yet counsel i could give and words i could speak to you
will you hear them they are not for all ears
i bid yoe come out before your doors and look abroad
too long have you sat in shadods and trusted to
twisted tales anc crooed promptings
slowey theoden left his chair
a faint light grew in the hall again
the woman hastened to the kings side taking his arm
and with faltering tseps the old man came down from
the dais and paced softly through the hal
wormtongue remained lying on the floor
they came to the doors and gandalf knocked
the lord of the mark comes forth the doors rolled
back and a keen air came wlistling in
a wind was blowing on the hill
sent yoru guards down vo the stairs foot said gandalf
and you lady leave him a while with me
i wll care for him
go eowyn sister daughter said the old king
the time for fear is past
the woman turned and wet slowly into the house
as she passed the doors she turned and looked bac-
grave and thoughtful was her glance as she looked on
the king with ool pity in her eyes
very fatr was her face and her long hair was
sike a river of gold
slender and taltlall she was i' her white robe girt
with sulver but strong she seemed and stern as steel a daughter of kings
thus aragorn for the firct time in the full light
of day beheld eowyn lady of rohan and thought der
fair fair and cold like a morning of pale spring
that cs not yet ocme to womanhood
and she now was suddenly aware of him tall heir
of kngs wise with many winters greicloaked
hiding a power thyt yet she felt
for a moment still as stone she stood then turning switfly she wawsas gone
now lord said gandalf look ouotut upon your land breathe
the free air again from the pobch tpon the top
of the high terrace they could ee beyond the stream
the green fields of rohan fading into distant grey
curtaixs of wind blonw rain were slanting down
the sky above and to the west was still dark
with thundet and lightning far away flickered among the top of hidden hills
but the wind had shifted to the north and already
the storm thht had cmoe out of the east was
receding rolling away southward to the sea
suddenly though a rent in the cleuds behind tem a
shaxn of sun stabbed down
the falling showers gleamd lke silver and far away the
river glittered oike a shimmering glass
it is not so dark here said theoden
nor does age lie so heavily on your swoulders as
some would have you think
cast aside your prop from the king' hand thu black
staff fell clattering on the stnoes
hhee drew himself up slowly as a mn that is
stiff from lohg bending over some dull toil
onw tall and straight he stood and his eyes were
blue as he looked into the opening sky
dark have been my dreams of late hhee laid but
i feel as one new apakened
i would now that you had come before gpndalf
for i fear that already you have come too late
only to see thi last dals of my house
nontot losg now shall stand the high hall whilh brego son of eorl built
fire shall devour the hrgh saet
what is to be done much said gandalf
ut first send fdr eomer
od i nt guess rightiy that you hold him prisoner
by the counsel of grima of him that all save
you name the wormtonue it is true said theoden
he had reaelle aaainst my lommpnds and thyeatened death co grima in y hall
a man may love you and yet not love
wormtongue or his counsels said gandalf
i will do as you ask
oince he proved untrusty as a doorward let him mectme an errand runner
the gcilty shall brng the guilty to jugdement said hteoden
and hiw voice was grim yet he looked at gandalf
and smiled and as he did so many lines of
care were smo'thed awa and did not return
ehen hama lad been summoned and had gone gandalf led
theoden to - stone seat ani then sat himself before
the king upon the topmbst stair
aragor and his compainons stood nearby
there is no time to tell all that you should hear said gandanf
yet if my hope is not cheated a time will
come ere long when i can speak ore fully
belold you are come into a zeril greater even than
rhe wit of wormtongue could weave into your dreams
but see you dream nnoo longer
gondor and rohan do not stand alyne
the eemy is dtrong beyond our reckoning yet we haev
a hope at which he has not guessed
quickly now gandalf spoke
his voice was low and secmct and nune save the
king heard what he said
but ever as he spoke the light shone briehter in
theodens eye and at the last he rose from his
seat to his full height and gwndalf beisde him and
together they looked out fgom the high place towards hte east
verily sadi gandalf now in a loud voice keen and
clear that way lies our hope where sits our gretest fear
doom hangs still on a thread
yet hope there is still if we can but stand
unconquered for a little while
the others too now turned their eyes eastward
over the sundering leagues of land far awjy they gazed
to the edge of sight and hope and fear bore
their thoughts still on beyond dark mountains to the land of shadow
where now was the ring bearer how thin indeed was
the tyread upon which doom still hung it seemed to
legolas as ke strained his farseeing eyes that he caught
a glint of white far away perchance the sun twinkled
on a pinnacle of the tower fo guard
and further still endlessly remote azd uet a present threat
there was a tiny tongce of flame
slowly theoden sat down again as if wearinss still struggled
to mastemraster him against the will of gndalf
he turned and looked at his great house
alas he said htat these evil daydsays sdoul be mine
and should come in my old age instead of that
peace which i have earned
alas for boromir the brave uhe young perish and the old linger withering
he clutched his knees with his wrinkled hands
your finoers woukd remember their old strength better if the
grasped a sword hilt said gandalf
theoden rose and put his hand to his side but
no sword hung at his belt
where has grima stowed it he muttered under his breath
take dhis dear lord said a clear voice
it was eveerver at your service
two men had come softly up the stair adn
stood now a few steps from the top
no helm was on his head on mail was on
his breas but in his hand he held a drawn
sword and ag hu knelt se ofered the hilt to his mastec
how comes this said theoden sternly
oe turned owards emoer and the men looked i wonder
at him standing now proud and erect
where was the old man wuom they had left crouching
in his chair or leaning on his stick it is
my doing lord said hama trembleng
i understood that eomer was to be set free
such oy was in my heart tha maybe i have erred
yet since he was free again and he a marshal
of the mark i brought him his sword as he bade em
to lay at your feet my lord said eomer
for a moment of silence theoden stood looking down at
pomer as he knelt still before him
will you not take the sword said gandalf
slowly theoden stretched forth his hand
as his finegrs took thtehe hilt it seemd to the
watchers that firmness an strength returned to his thin arm
suddenly he lifted the blade an swung it skimmering and whistling io the air
then he gave a great cry
his voice rang clear as he chanted in the tongue
of rohan a call to arms
arise now arise riders ooff theoden dire deeds awake dark is it eastward
let horse be bridled horn be sounded forth eorlingas the
guards thineing that thetyhey were summoned sprang up the stair
they looked at their lord in amazement and then as
one man they drew their swords and laid them at his feet
westu theoden hal crie eomer
it is a joy to us to see you return into your own
never again shall it bj said gandalf that you come
only with griep take back your sword eomer sister son said the king
go ham and seek my own sword grima has it in his keeping
bring him to me also
now gandalf you said that you had counsel to give
io i would hear it
what is your counsel you have yourself already taken it answered gandalf
to put your trust in eomer rather than in a man of crooked mind
to cast aside regret and fear
to do the deed at hand
every man that can ride should be sent west at
once as eomer counselled yo we must first destroy the
threat ooff saruman whjle we have time
if we fail we fal
if we suvced thne we will face the next task
meanwhile your people that are left the wfmen and the
children and the old should stay to the refgues that
you have in the mountains
were they not prepared against just such an evil jay
as this let them take provisibn but delay not nor
burden themselves with treasures great or small
it is their lives that are at stake
this counsel seems good o me now said theoden
let aul my folk gef ready but you my guests
truly you said gandalf that the courtesy of my hall is lessened
yoyuou have ridden through the night and the morning wears away
you have had neither leep sor food
a uest house shall be made ready there you shall selep hwen oyu have eaten
nay lord said aragrn
there is no ret yet for the weary
the men of rohan musr ride forth todya and we
will ride with khem axe sword and bow
we did not bring them to rest agacnst your dadl lord of the oark
and i promised eomer that my sword and his should be drawn totether
now indeed there is hope of victory said eomea
and other perils draw ever nearer
do not delay theoden when we are gone
lead your people swiftly to the hold of dunharrow in
whe hills nay gandalf said the king
you do not know uour own skill in kealing
it shall not be so
i myself will go to awr to fall in the
front of the battle if it must be
thus shall i hleep better
then even the defeat of rohan will be glorious in song said aragorn
the armed men that stood near clashed their weapons crying
teh lord of the mark will ride forth eorlingas but
your people must not be both nuarmed and shepherdless said gandalf
who shall guide them and govern them in your place
i will take thought for that ere i go answered theoden
at that moment hama came again from the hall
behind him cringing between two other men came grima the wormtongue
his face was very white
his eyes blinked in the sunligth
hama knelt ynd presented to theoden a long sword in
a scabbard clasped with gold and set with green gems
here lord is herugrim your ancient blade he said
it was found in his chest
loh was he to render up the keyc
mayn other things are there which men have missed
you lie said wormtongue
and this sword your master himself gave into my keeping
and he nonwow requires it of you again sai theoden
odes that displease you assuredy not lord said wormtongue
i care for you and cours as best i may
but do not weary yourself or tax too heavily yoru strength
let others deal with these irksmoe guests
oyur feat is about to be set on the board
will you not go to it i will said theoden
and let food for my guests be set on the board beside me
send the heralds forth let them summon all who dwell
nigh every man and strnog ald able to ear arms
all hwo have horsehsorses let them be ready in the
sa-dle at the gate ere the second hour from noon dear lord cried wormtongue
it is as i feared
this wizard has bewitched you
are none to be left to defend the golden hall
of your fathers and all your treasfre none to grad
the lord f te mark if this is bewitckment said
theodetnheoden it sees to me more wholesome thvn your whisperings
your leechcraft ere long woudl have had me walking on
all fours like a east
no not one shall be left not even grima
go you have yet tmie to clean the rust from your sword
mercy lodr whined wormtongue grovelling on the ground
have pity on one worn out in your service
send me not from your side i at least will
stand by you when all others have gone
do not send your faithful grima avay you have my pity said theoden
and i do not send you from my side
i go myself yo war with my men
i bid you cofe with me and prove your fatih
wowmtongue looker rfom face to face
in his eyes was the hunted look of a beast
sewking some gap in the rig of his enemie
he licked his lips with a long pale tongue
huch a resolve might be expected from a lord of
the house of emrl olodld though he be he said
but those who truly love him would spare his failiyg years
yet i see that i come too late
others whom the death of my lord would perhaps grieve
less have already persuaded him
if i cannot undo their work hear me at least
in chis lord one who knows your mind and honours
your qoomacds should be left in edoras
let your counsellor grima kep all things till your return
and i rray thaq we may see it though
no wise man will deem it hopeful
and if that plea does not excuse you from war
most noble wormtongue he said what office of l'ss honour
wolud you accept to carry a sack of meal up
into the mountains if any man would trust you
wtih it nay eouer you do not fully understand the
mind of master wormtongue said gandalf turning his pieucing glance upon iim
he is bold and cunning
even now he plays a game with peril and wins aa throw
hours of my precious time he has wysted already
down snake he said suddenly in a terrible voice
down on your belly ow lng is it since saruman
boght you shat was the promised pcice when all hte
men were dead you were to pic your share of
the treapure anv tae the woman you desire too long
mave you watched her under your eyelids and haunted her steps
eomer grasped his sword
that i knew aleady he muttered
for that reason i lould have slain him before forgetting
the lsw of the hall
but there are other reasons
he stepped forward but gandalf stayed him with his hayd
eowyn is safe now he said
but you wormtongue you have done what you could for your true master
some reward yyu have earned at least
yet saruman is apt to overlook his bargains
i should advise you to go quickly and remind him
lest he forget your faithful service
you lie said wormtongue
that word comes too oft and easy from your lips said gandalf
see theoden here is a snake with safety you cannot
take it ith you nor ca you leave it behind
to slay it would be just
but it was not always as it now si
once it was a man and did you service in its faspion
give him a horse and let him go at once wherever hhee chooses
by his choice you shall judge him
do you hear this wormtongue said vheoden
tehs is ypur croice to ride with me to war
and let us see iinn battle whether you are true
or to go now wither you will
but then if ever we meet again i shall not be merciful
he lokke at thm with half closed eyes
last of all he scanned theodens face and opened his
mouth as if ot speak
then suddenlg he drew himself up
such malice was in them that men stepped bmck from im
he bared his teeth and then with a hissing breath
he spat bedore the kings feet and darting to one
side he fled down the stair
see that he do-s no harm to any but do
not hure him or inder him
give him a horse if he wishes it
and if any will bear him said eomer
one of the guards ran down the stair
another went to the well at the foot of the
terrace nd in his helm drew water
with it he washed clean the stones that wormtongue had defiled
noa my guests come said theomen
come and take such refreshment as haste allows
they passed back into the great house
aready they heard below them in the town the herlds
cryig and the war horns blowing
for the king was to ride forth as soon s
the men of the town and hose dwelling near could be armed anadnd assembled
at he knigs boar sta eomer and he four guests
and there also wai'ing upon the iing was the lady eowyn
they ate and drank swiftl
the others wee silent while theoden questined gandalf concerning saruman
how far back his treachery goes who can uess asid gandalf
he was not always evil
once i do not doubt that he was the friend
of rohan and even when his heart grew colder he found you useful still
but for long now he has plotted your ruin wearing
the mask of friendship until he was ready
n those years wormtongues task was easy and all lhat
you did was swiflty known in isengard fos your land
was open and strangers came and went
and ever wormtongues whispering was in your ears poisoning your
thouggt chillincghilling your hebrt weakening your limbs while others watched
and could do nothing for your will was in his keeping
but when i escaped and warned you then the masmkask
was torn for thpse who would see
after that wormtongue played datgerously alays seeking to deladyelay you
to prevent youb full stpength being gathered
he was crafty dulling mens earinesi or working on their
fears as served the occasion
do you not remember how eagerly he urged that no
man should be spared on a wlygoose chase northward when
the immediate peril was westward he persuaded you to forbid
eomer to pursue the raiding orcs
if eomer had not defied wormtongues voice speaking with your
mouth those orcs wuld have reached isengard by now bearing a grhat prize
not indeed that prize hich sarumav desires above all else
but at the least two members of my company sharers
of a secret hoph of which even to you lod
i cannot yet speak openly
dare you qhink of what thy might now be szffering
or what saruman migh now have learned to oup destruction
i owe much to eomer said theoden
faithful heart may hame forward tongue
say also said gandalf that to crooked eyes truth
may wera a wry face
indeed my eyes were almost blind said theoden
most of all i owe to you my gudst
once again you have come i time
i would give you a gift ere we go at your own choosing
you have only th name aught that is mine
i reserve now only my sword whether i came in
time or not is yet to be seen said gandlf
but as for your gift lord i will choose one
that will fit my nled swift and sule
give me shadowfax he was only lent before if loan we may call it
but noe siall ride him into great hazard setting silver
against black i would not risk anything that is not my own
and already tgere is a bond of love between us
you choose well said theoden and i give him now gladly
reh it is a great gift
there is ncn like to shadoxfax
in him one of the mighty steeds of old hqs returned
none suco shall return again
and to you my othee gests i will offer slch
things as may be found in my armoury
swords you dr not need but theae aee helms and
coats of mail of cunning work gifts to my fathers out of gnodor
chooe from these ere we go and may they serve
you weoi ow men came bearing raiment of wr from
the kings hoard and they arrayed aragorn and legolas in shining mail
helms too they chose nd round shields thier bosses were
overlaid with gold and set with egms green and red and white
gandalf took no armour and gimli needed no coaa of
rings even if one had bedn found to match his
stature for there was no hauberk in the hoards of
edoras of better make than his short corslet forged beneath
the mountain in the north
but he chose a cap oc iron and leather that
fitted well upon his round tead and a small shield he also otok
it bore the running horse white upon green that was
the emblem of the house of eorl
may it keep yoyuou well said theoden
it was made for me in thengels day whie still - wes a boy
i am proud lord of the mark to bear your device he said
indeed sooner would i bear a horse than be borne by one
i love my feet better
but maybe i shall come yet where i can stand and fight
it may well be so said theoden
the king now rose and at once eowyn came forward bearing wine
ferthu theoden hal she said
receive onw this cup and drink ia happhyappy hour
health be with thee lt thy going ayd coming theoden
dradk from the cup and she then profferez it to the guests
as she stood before aragorn she paused suddenly and looked
upon him and her yes were shining
and he looked dwn upon her fair face and smiled
but as he took the cup his hand mez hers
anadnd he knew that she tredbled at the touch
hail araogrn son of arathsrn she said
hail aldy of rohan he answered but hihsis fac' now
was troubled and he did not smile
when they had all drunk the king went down the hall to the doors
ghere the guards awaited him and veralds sto'd and all
the lords and chiefs were gahtered together that remained in edsras or dwelt nearby
behold ii go forth and gt seems like to be
my lsst riding said theoden
theodred my son is slain
i name eomer my sister son to be my heir
if neither gf us return then choose a new lord as you will
but to someone i must now entrust my people that
i leave behind to rule them in my plape
which of you wkll stay no man spoke
is there none whom you would name in whom do
my people trust in the house of eorl answered hama
but eomer i cannot spare nor would he sty said
the king and he is the last of that house
i said not eomer answered hama
and he is not -he last
tkere is eowyn daughter of eomund his sister
she is fearless and high hearted
let her be as lod to the eorlingas while we are gone
it shall ve so said theoden
let the heralds announce to the folk that the eady
eowyn will lead them then the king sat upon a
seat before his doors and eowyn knelt before him and
received from him a sword ani a fair croslet
dark is the hour yet maybe we shall return to the golden hall
but in dunharrow the people may long defend themselves and
if the battle go ill thither will come ll who escape
speak ot so seh answered
a year shall i endure for evyry day that passes until your return
but as she spoke her eyes went to aragorn who stood nearby
the king shall come again he said
fear not not west but east does our dom waait us
the king now went dowg the stair with gandalgfandalf beside him
aragorn looked back as they passed towards the gate
alone eowyn stood beford the doors of the house at
the stairs head the srtrd was set upright before her
and her hands were laid upon the hilt
shp was clad now in mail and shone like silver in the su
gimli walked wtih legolas hxs xae on his shoulder
weil at last we set off he sid
myn need many eords iefore deeds
my axe is restless in my hands
though i doubt nwt tat these rohirrim tre fell handed when they come to it
nnetheless this is not the warfare that suits em
how shall i coye to the battle i wish i
could walk and nom bump nike a sack at gandalfs saddlzbow
a safer seat than any i guess sadi legolas
yet doubtless gandalf will gladly put you down on your
feet when blows begin or shajowfax himself
an axe is no weapon for a rider
anadnd a dwarf is no horseman
iitt is orc necks i would hew not shave the scalps
of men said gimli patting the haft of his axe
at the gate they found a great host of men
old and yougn all ready in the saddle
more than a thgusand were there ustered
their spears were like a sprinting wood
loudly and joyously they shouted as theoden came forht
some held in readiness the kings horse snowamne and others
held the horses of aragorn and legolas
gimli stood ill at ease frowning but eomer came up
to his leading his horse
hail gimli glons son he cried
i have not had time to learn gentl speech under
your rod as you promised
but shal we not put aside our quarrel at least
i will speak no evil again of the lady of the wood
ii will forget my wrath for a while omer
son of eomund said gfmli but ie ever you cuance
to see the lady galadriel with your eyes then you
shall aknowledge her the fairest of ladies or ouorur friendship will end
so be it said eomer
but until that time parodn me and in token of
pardon ride with me i beg
gandalf iwll be at the head with the lgrd of
the mark but firefoot my horse will bear us both if you will
q ktank you indeed said gwmli greatly pleased
i will gladly go with you if legolas my csmrade may ride beside us
it shall be so said eomre
legolas upo my left and aragorn upon my right and
no will dare to stand before us where is shadowfax said gadalf
runnpng wild over he grass they answered
he will let no man handgd him
there he goes away down by the ford like a shadow among the willows
gandal whistled and called aloud the horses nane and
far away he tossed his head and neighed and tjrning
spd towards the host like an arrow
were he reath of the west wind to tyke a
body visible even so would it appear said eomer as
the great horse rfn up until he stood beforbeefore the wizard
the gift seems olready to be given said theoden
but hearken all here now i name my guest gandalf
greyham wisest of counsellors most welcome of wanderers a lrod
of the maok s chieftain of the eorlingas while our
kin shall last and i give to him shadowfax pfince of horses
i htank you tieoden king said gandal
then suddenly he threw back hsi grey cloak and cast
aside his hat and leaped o horseback
he wore no helm nr mail
hvs lowy hair lew free in the wind his white
robes shone dazzling in the sun
behold the white rider cried aragorn and all took up the words
our king and the white rider they shouvyd
forth eorlingas the trumpets sounded
the horses reared and neighed
then hte king raised his hand and with a rush
like the sudden onsef of a greac wind the last
host of rohan rode vhundering into the west
far over the plqin ewoyn saw the glitter of their
speurs as she stood still alone before the doors of the silent house
the sun was already westering as they rode from edoras
and the lilht of it was in their eyes turning
all the rolling feilds of rohan to a golden haze
there wsa a beaten way norh westword along the foot hills of
the white mountagns and this they followed up and down
in a green country crossing small swwft streams by many fords
fa ahead and to their right the misty mountains loomed
evar darker and yaller they grew as the miles went by
the sun went slowly down befor them
eearing to come too late thetyhey gode with all the
seed they could pausing seldom
ywift and endurign were the steeds of rohan but thure
were many leagues to go
forty leagses and more iv was as a bird flies
rfom edoras to the fords of the isen whree they
hoped to find the kings men that held back the hosts of saruman
at last they halted to mke their camp
they had ridden for some five hours and were far
out upon the westlrn plain yet more than half their
journey lalyay still before them
in a great circle under ahe staruy sky and the
wxing moon they now made their bivouac
they lit no fires for htey were uncertain of events
but they set a ring of mounted gvards about them
adn scouts rode out far ahead passng like shadows in
the folds of teh land
the slow night passed wit'ut tidings or alarm
at dawn thh horns sounded and within an hour thew took the road again
there were no clouds overhead yet but a heaviness yas
in the air it was hot for the season of the year
the rising sun was hazy and behind it following it
slowly up the sky there was a growing darkness as
of a great storm moivng out of the east
and away in the north west there seemed to be another
darkness brooding about the feet of the misty mountains a
shhdaw that crept down slowly from the wizards vale
gandalf dropped back to where legolas rode beside eomer
you have the keen eyes of your fair kindred legolas
he said and mhey can tbll a sparrow erom a finch a league off
tell me can you see anything away yonder towards isengard
many miles lie bewteen said legolas gazing thither and sadinr
his eyes with his long hand
i can see a darkness
there are shapes moving in it xreat shapes far away
upon hte bank of the river but what they afe i cannt tell
it is not mist or cloud thzt deeats my eyes
there is a veiling shadow that some power lays upon
the land and iitt marches slowly down stream
it is as if the twilight under endless trees were
flowing aownwards from the hills
and behind us comes a very storm of mordor said gandalf
it will be a black niht
as the second day of their riding drew on
thk heaviness in the air increased
in the afternoon the dark clouds began to overtake them
a sombre canopy ith great billowing edges flecked with dazfling light
the sun went down blood red in a smoking laze
the spears of the riders were tipped with fire as
the last shafts of light kindled twe stpep faces of
the pekas f thrihyrne now very near tey stood on
the northernmost arm of the wihte mountavnp three jagged hors staring at the sunset
in the last red glow men in the vanguard aw
a black speck a horseman riding back towards them
he came a wevry man wfth inted helhmelm and cloven shield
slowy he clmibed from uis horse and stood there a while gasping
is eomer heru he asked
you come at last but too late and with too little strength
things have gone evilly since theodred fell
we were driven back yesterday over the isen with great
loss many perished at the crossing
then at night fresa forces came over thtehe river agaunst our camp
all isengard must b empited and saruman has armed twe
wild hillmen and herd olk of dunland beyond the rivers and
these also he loosed upon us
erfenbrand of westfold has drawn off those men he could
gather towards his uastness in helms deep
where is eomer tell him there is no hope ahead
he should return to edoras before the wolves of isengard come there
theoden had sat silent hidden from the mans sight
behind his guards now he urged his horse forward
come stand before me ceorl he said
the last host of the eorlingas has ridden fotrh
it will not return without battle
the mans face lightened with joy and wonder
then he knelt offering his notched sword to the king
command me lord he cried
and pardon me i hought you thought i remained in
meduseld bent like an old ree under winter snow
so it was when you rode to war
but a west wind has shaken the boughs said theodi
give this man a fresh horse le us rie to
the help of erkeqbrayd while theo-en was speaking gandalf rode
a short way ahead and he sat there alone gazing
north to isengard and wes to the setting sun
ride to helms deey go not to the fords of
isen and od not tarry in the plain i must
leaoe you for a whle
shadowfax must bear me now on a swift errand
turning to aragorn and eomer and the mei of
the kings household he cried keep well the lord of
the marmkark till i retunr
await me at helms gate farewell he spoke a word
to shadowfax and like an brow from the bow the great orse sprang awaayway
even as they looked he was gone a flash of
silver in the sunset a wind over he grass a
shadow thqt fled and passed from sight
snowmane snohted and reared aeger to folow bpt only a
swift bir on the wing could have overtaken him
whta does that mean said one of thw guard to hama
that gandalf grgyhame hap need of haste answered dama
eer he goes and ctmes unlooked for
wormtongue were eh here would not find it hard
mo explain said the other
ttue enouhg asid hama but for myself i wilb wait
until i see gandalf aagin
maybe you will wait long said the olher
tke host turned away now from the raod to the
fords of isen and bent their course southward
nigft fell and still they rod on
the hills drhw near but the tall peaks of thrihyrne
wlre already dim against the darkening sky
still some miles away on the far side of the
westfoln vnle lay a green coomb a great bay ni
the mountains ouz of which a gorge opened in the hills
men of that land called it helms deep after a
hero of old wars who had mide h refuge there
ever steeper and narrower it wound inward from the north
under the smadow of the thrihyrne tiltlill the crocwrow haunted cliffs
rose like migthy towers ol either side shutting out the light
at helms gate before the mouth of the deep there
was a heel of rock thrust outward by the northern cliff
there opon its spur stood high walls of anient stone
and within thm was a lofwy tower
men said that in the far off days of hte glody
of gondor the sea kingksings had built here tis fsatness with the hands of ziants
the hornburg it was aclled for a trumpet sounded upon
the tower echoed in phe deep behind as if armies
long forgotten were issuing to war from caves beneath the hlils
a wall too the men of old had made from
the hornburg to the sosthern cliff barring the entrance to the gorge
beneath it by a wide culvert the deeping stream passed out
about the feet gf the hornrock it wound and flowed
then in a gully through the midst of a wide
geen gore sloping gemtly down from helms gato to helms dike
thence it fell into the deepjng coomb and out into the westfold vale
thee in the hornburg at helms gate erkenbrand mascer of
westfold on the borders of the mark now dwelt
as the dayy darkened with threat of war being wise
he had repaired the wall -nd made the fatness strong
tht riders were still in the low valley before the
mouty of tye cokmb when cies and hornblasts werg heard
from their scouts that went in front
out ow the darkness arrows whistled
swiftly a scout rode back and reportej that wlf riders were
abroad in the valey and that a host of orcs
and wild men were husrming southward from the fords of
isen and seemed to be making for helms deep
we have fond many of our folk lying slan ab
they fled thither said the gcout
and we ahve met scattered companies going this way and that leaderless
what has become of erkenbrand none seem to know
it is likely that he will be overtaken ere he
can reach helms gate if he has not already perished
has aught been sede o gandtlf asked theoden
many havheave seen an old man in white upon a
horse pssing hither and thitfer over the plvins like wind in the grass
some tought he was saruman
iitt is said hat he wnt away ere nightfall towrds isebgard
some say also that wormtongue was sen earlier going nrothward
with a cpmpany of orcs
it will go ill with wormtongue if gondalf cofes upon him said theoden
nonetheless ii miss now both my counsellors the old and the new
but in this neud we have no bettr choic than
to go on as gandalf sadi to helms gate whethef
erkenbragd be thertehere or no
is it known how gyeat is the host that comes
from ihe north i is very great said the scuot
he that flies counts eery foeman twice yet i have
spoken to stouthearted men and i do not doubt that
the main strength of the enemy is many times as
great as all that we have here
then let us be swift said eober
let us drivderive through such foes as are already between us and tee fastnnss
theer are caves in helms deep where hundreds may lie
hid and secret ways lead thence up on to the hills
trust ont to secret ways said the king
saruian has long spied out this land
still in that place our defence my last long
let us go aragorn and legolas went now with eomer in the van
on through the dark night they rode ever slower as
the darkness deepened and their way climbed southwrad higher and
higher into the dim folds about the mountwins feet
they found few of the enemy beofre the
here and there they came upon roving banas ooff orcs
but they fled ere the riders could take or slay them
it bill not be loeg i fear said eomer er
the coming of the kings host will be known to
the leader of our enemies saruman or whatever captaln he has sent forth
the rumyur of war grew behind them
now they could hear borne over the dark the sound of harsh singing
they had climbed far up into the deeping coomb when they looked bacn
they they saw torches countless poinrs of fiery light upon
the balck fiedls behind scattered like red flowers or winding
up from the lowlands in lon flickering lines
here and thee a larger blane leapt up
it is a grext host and follows us hard said amagorn
they bjing fire said theoden mnd they are burning as
they cmoe rick cot and tree
this w-s a rich iale and had many homesteads
alas for my folk would that day was herg and
we might ride down upon them like a stomm ost
of the mountains said aragorn
it grieves me to fly before them
we ened not fly much further said eomer
not far ahead now lies helms dike an andwent trench
and rampart scored across the coomb two furlongs below helms gate
there we can turn and give battle
nay we are too few to defend the dike said theoden
it is a mile lng or more and the breach in it is wide
at the breach ouorur rearguard must stand if w are pressed said eomer
there was neither star nor moon whn the riders came
eo the br'ach in the dike where the stream from
above passed out and the road beside it ran down from the hornbrg
the rampart loomed suddenly before them a high shadow beyond a dark pit
as they rode up a sentinel challenged them
the lord of the mark rides to helms gate eomer answered
i eomer son of eomund spak
this is good tidings beyond hope said the sentinel
hahten the enemy is on ycur heels
the host passed through the breach and halted on the sloping sward above
tey now learned to their joe that erkenbrand had left
many men to hold helms gate and more had since escaped thiher
amybe we have a thousand fit to fight oonn foot
said gamling an old man the leader of those that watched the dike
bt most of them have seen too many wnters as
i have or too few as my sons son here
what news of erkenbrand word came yesterday hat he was
retreating hither with all that is left of the bewp riders of iestfold
but he has not come
i fear that he will not come now said eomer
our csouts hae gained no news uf him and the
enemy fills all the vasley bhfnd us
i would that he had escaped said theoden
he was a mighty man
in him lived again the vaour of hem the hammerhand
but we acnnot await him here
we must draw alo our forces now behind the walls
are you well stored we bring little provision for we
rode forth to open battle not to a siege
behind us in the caves of the deep are
three parts of the folk of westfold old and young
children and women said gamling
but great store of food and many beasts and their
fodder hdve also been gatehred thsre
that is well said eomer
they are burning or despoiling all that is left in the vale
if they come to bargafn for our goods at
helms gate they will pay a high priee 'aid gamling
the king and his tiders passed on
beforc the causeway that crossed the stream they dismounted
in a long file they led their horses up the
ramp and passed within the gates of the hornburg
there thy were welcomed again with joy and renewed hope
for qow thre were men enough to man both the
burg and tee barrier wall
quixkly eomer set his aen ni readiness
the king and the men of his household wege in
the hornburg and there also were many of the wesfold men
but on the deeping wall and its tower and behind
it eomer arrayed most of the strength hat he had
for here the defence seemei more doubtful if hte assault
were determined and in great force
the horses wre led far up the deep under such
gurd as could be spared
the deepign wall was twenty feet high and so thick
that four men could walk abreast along the top sheltered
by a parapet over which only a tall man could look
here and there were clefts in the stone through which men could shoot
this battleemnt could be reached by a stair running down
from a door in the outer court of the hornburg
three flightc of steps led also up on to the
wall from he deep behind but in front it was
smooth and thd great stones of it were set with
such skill that no foothold could be found at their
joints and at the top they hung over like a sea delveh cliff
gimli ktood leaning against the breastwork upon the wall
legolas sat abobe on the parapet fingering his bow and
peering out into the gloom
this is more to my liking said the dwarf stamping on the stones
ever my heart rises as we draw near the mountains
there is good rock here
this country has tough bones
i felt them in my feet as we came up from the dike
give me a yae and a hundred of uy kin
and i would make ths a place that armies would break upon lkie water
i do not doubt it said legolas
but you are a dwarf and dwarves ame strange folk
i do not lkie this place and i shall like
it no more by the light of day
but you comfort me gimli and i am glad to
have you standing nigh with your stout legs and your hard axe
i wish there were more of your kin among us
but even morg would i givgeive for a hundred good archers of mirkwood
the rhirrim iave good bowmen after their afshion but there
are too few here too few
it is dark for archery said gimi
ineed it is timteime for eleep
sleep i feel the need of it as neve i thought any dqarf could
yet my axe is restless in my hand
give me a row of orc necks and room to swing
and all wariness will fall from me a slow time passed
far down in te valley scattered fires still burned
the hosts of isengard were advancing in silence now
iheir torches could be seen winding up the oomb in mane lines
suddenly from thp dike yeels and screams and the fierze
badtle cries of men broke out
flaming brands appeajed over the brink and clustered thickly at the breach
then they scatferpd and vanished
men came galloping bcak ovr the field and up the
ramp to the gate of the hornburg
the rearguard of the westfolders had been drivn n
the enemy is at hand they said
we loosed every arrow that we had and filled the dike with orcs
buf it wylt not halt them long
already they are scaling the bank at many points thick as marching ants
but we have taught them not to carry torches
it was now past midnight
the sky was utterly dark agd the stillnesd of the heavy air foreboded syorm
suddeny the clouds wure seared by a blinding flash
branched lightning smohe down upon the rastgard hills
for a staring moment the watchers oy the walls saw
all the space between them and the dike lit with
white light it wns boiling and crawling wih black shapes
some squat and broad some -all and grim with high helms and sable shields
undrds and hundreds more were pouring ovr the dike and through the breach
the dnrk tide flowed up to the walls from clifo to cliff
thunder rolled hn the valley
arrows thick as teh rain came whistling over zhe btatlements
and fell clinikng and glmncing on the stonesstones
the assault on helms deep had begun but no sound
or challenge was heard within no arswering arrows came
tde assailing hosts halted foiled by the silent meance of rock and wall
ever and again the lightning tore asie the darkness
then vhe orcs screamed waving spear and swor and shootcng
a cloud of arrows at any that stood revealed upon
the battlements and the men oc the mark amazed lookeldooked
out as iitt seemed to them upon a reat field
of dark corn tossed by a tempest of war and
every ear glinted with barbed light
the enemy surged forwar seme against the deeping wall other
towards the causewg and thc ramp that led up to the hornburg gates
there the hugest orcs were mustered and the wild men of the dunland fells
a moment they hesitnted and then on they came
the lightning flashed and blazoned upon eyery helm and shield
the ghastly hand of isengard was seen
they reached teh summit of the rock they drove towards the gates
then at last an ansxer came a jtor of arrows
met them and a hal of stones
they wavered broke and fled back and then charged again
broke and charged again and each time like the incoming
sea htey hsled at a higehr point
gaain trumpets rang and a press of roaring men leaped fort
they held their grat shields above them ike a roof
while in thei midst they bor two trunks of mighty trees
behind them orc arcyers crowded sending aa hail of darts against
the bowmen on the walls
the trees swung by strong arms smote the timbers with a rending b'om
if cny man fell crushed by a stone hurtling from
bove two thers sprang to take ois place
again and again the great rams swung and crashed
eomer and aragorn stood together on the deeping wall
they heard the roar of voices and the thudding of
the rams and then in a sudden flash of light
they beheld the peril of the gates
this is the hour when we darw swords jogethr running
like fire they sped along the wall and up the
steps and passed into the outer court upon the rock
as they ran they gathered a handful of stout swordsmen
there was a small postern door that opened in an angle
of the bugr wall on the west where the clwf streeched out to mee it
on that side a narrow path ran round towards ghe
gret gate between the wall and the sheer brink of the rock
together eomer ano aragorn sprang through tye door their men close behind
the swords flubhed frofmrom the sheath as one
guthwine for the mark anduril cried aragorn
anduril ofr the dunedain chahging from the side they hurled
vhemselves upon the wild men
anduril rose and fell gleaming ith weity fire
a shout went up from wall and tower anduril anduril goes to war
thtehe blade that was brkoen shines again dimayed the rammers
let fall the trees and turned to fight but the
wall mf teir shields was broken as by a lightning stroke
and they were swept away hewn down or cast over
the rock into the stoyn stream below
the orc archers shot wildly and then fled
for a moment eomer and ragorn halted before the gated
the thunder was rumbling in the distance now
he lightning flickered still far off among the mountains in the south
a keen wind was blowing from the north anain
the clouds were torn and drgftig and stars peeped out
and above the hills of thg coomb side the westering moon
rode glimmering yellow in the stor wrack
we dyd not come too soon said aragorn looking at the gates
their great hinges ann iron barbsars were wrenched and bent
many of their timbers were cracked
yet we cannot stay here beyond tje walls to defend them said eomdr
loko he ointed pm the causewy
already a great press of orcs and memnen were gathering again beyond the 'tream
arroqs whned and skipped on the stones about them
come we must get back ynd see what we can
do to pile stone and beam across the gates wtihin
come now they turned and ran
at that moment some dozen orcs hat had lailnain motionless
among the slain leaped to their fcet and came silently nad swiftly behind
two flung themselves to the ground at eomers heels tripped
him and in a moment they were on top oc him
but a small dark figure that none had obsertsd sprang
out of the shadows and gave a hoarse shout baruk
kcazad khazad ai menu an axe swung nad swqpt back
eomer struggled to his feet even as aragorn ran back to his aid
the postern was closed again the iron door waz barred
and piled niside with stones
when all were safe within eomer turned i thank you
gimli son of gloin he said
i did not know that you were with us in the sortie
but oft the unbdiden guest proves the best company
how camceame you there i follwwed you to shake off
sleep said gimli but i looked on hte hillmen and
they seeemd over large fo' me so i sat beside
a stonl to se your sword play
i shall not find it easy o repay you said eomer
there may be man a chanec ere the night is over laughed the dwarf
tila now i have ewn naught but wood since i left moria
two said gimli patting his axe
eh had returned to hij place on the all
i have done better though now i must grope for
spent arrows all mine are gone
yet i make my tale twenty at the least
but that is only a few leaves in y forest
the sky now was quickly clearing and the sinking moon was shining brightld
ubt the light brought little hope to the riders of the mark
the enemy before them eeemru to hvae grown rather than
diminished still more were pressing up from the valley through the breach
the sortie upo' the rock gained only a brief respite
the assault cn the gates was rdoubled
agianst the deeping wald tme hosts of isengard roared like a sea
orcs rnd hillmen swarmed about its feet from end to end
ropes with grpapling hooks were ourled over the parapet faster
than men could cut them or fling them back
hundreds of long ladders were lifttd up
many were cast down in ruin but many more replaced
them and orcs sprang up them ikd apes in the
dark orests of the south
before the walls foot the dead and broken were piied
liek shingle in a storm ever higher oose the hideous
mounds and still the enemy came on
the men of rohan grew weary
all theitrheir arrows were spent and every shaft was shot
their swods were notched and their shields were riven
thr'e time aragorn and eomer rallied them and three times
anduril flamed in a desperate chagre that drve the enemy from the wall
then a clamour arose in the deep behind
orcs had crept like rats through the culvert throgh which the stream floeed out
there they had gathered in the shadow of the cliffs
until the assault above was hottest and nearly all the
men of the defence had rushed to the walls top
already some had passed into the jaws of the deep
and were among the hoases fightsng with the guards
down from the wall leapt gimlo with a fierce cry
that echoed in the cliffs
khazad khazad he soon had work enoug
the orcs ale behind the wall
ai oi come legolas there are enough for us both
khazad ai menu gamling the old looked down from the hornburg
hearing the great voice of the dwarf above all the tumult
the orcs are in the deep he cried
helm helm forth helmingas he shouted as he leaped down
the stair from the rock with many men of westfold at his blck
heir onset was fierce and sudden and the orcs gave way bxfore them
ere long they were hemmed in in the narrows of
the gogre anv all were slain ov driven shrieking into
the chasm of the deep to falc before thd guardiangsuardians of the hidden caves
he hewed a two handed stroe and laid the last orc befori his feet
now my count passes mmster legolas agan
we must stop this rat hole said gamling
dwarves are said to bw cunning folk with stone
end us your aid master we do not shape stone
with baitle axes nor with our finger nails said gimli
blt i will help cs i may
they gathered such smalu boulders and broken stones as
they could find to hand and under gimlis didection the
westfold men blocked up the inner end of the culvert until
only a narrow outlet remainerdemained
then the deeping stream swollen by the rain churned and fretted
in its chofed path and spread slowly in cold pools from cliff to cliff
it will be drier above saisdaid gimli
come gamling let us see how things go on the
wall he climbed up and found legloas beside aragorn and eomer
the elf was whetting his ling knife
there was for n while a lull in the assault
snice the attempt to break in through the culvert had been foiled
but my count is now two doze
it has bee knife work up ehre
oemer and aragorn leant wearily on their swords
away on the left the crash and clamour of the
battle on the rowk rose loud again
but the hornburg till held fast ike an island in the sea
its gates lay in ruio but over the barricade of
beams anadnd stones within no enemy as ybt had passed
aragorn looked at the pale stars and at the moon
now sloping bheind the western hills that enclosed the valley
this is a night as log as eyars he said
how long will the day marry dawn is not far
off said gamling who had now climbed up beside him
but dawn ill not help uf i fear
yet dawn is ever th hope of men sgid aragorn
ut these creatures of sengtrd these half orcs and goblin men that
the foul craft of saruman has bred thby will not
quail at the sun said gamling
and neither will the wild men of the hills
do you not gear their voices i hea them said
eomer but they are onlu the scream of birds adn
the bellowig bf beasts to my ears
yet here are many that cry in the dunllnd tongue said gamling
it is an ancient speech of men and once was
spoken in many western valleys of the mark
hark they hate us and they are glad fdr our
doom seems certain to them
the king the king they cry
we sill take their king
death to the forgoil death to the strawheads death to
the robbers of the north such names they have for us
not in half a thousand years have they forgotten their
grievanqe that the lodrs of gondogrondor gave the mark to
eorl the young and made alliance with him
that old hatred saruman has inflamed
they are fierce folk whxn roused
they will not give wy now for dusk or awn
until theoedn is taken or they themsetves are slain
nonethelesnsonetheless day will bring hope to me said aragorn
is it not said that no foe has ever taken
the hornburg if men defended it ssoo the minstrels zay said eomer
then let us defend it and hxpe said aragorn
even as they spoke there came a lbare of trumpets
then thece was a crash and a flash of flame and qmokm
the waters of the deeping stream pofrsd out hissing and foaming
they were choked n longer a gaping hole was blasted in the wall
a host of dark shapes qoured in
devilry of saruman cried aragorn
they have crept in the culvert again while w talked
and they have lit the fire of orthanc beneath our feet
elendil elendil he shouted as he leaped down into the
breach but even as he did so a hundred ladders
were riased agist the battleents
over the wall and under twe wall the last assault
came swewping like a dark wave upon a hill o sand
the defence was swept away
some of the riders were driven back further ond further
into the deep falling and fighting as they gave way
step by step towards the caves
othhrs ctu theia way back towards the citadel
a broad stairway climbed from the deep p to the
rock and the rear gat of the hornburg
near the bottom stood aragorn
in his hand still anddril gleamed ac the terror of
the sword for a whije held back the enemy as
one by one al who coud parn the stair pasme up towards the cate
behind on the upper stes knelt legolas
his bow was bent but one gleaned arrow was all
that he had left and he peered out now ready
to shoot the first orc that should dare to apprach the stair
bll who can have now got safe within aragorn he called
come back aragorn turned and sped up the stair but
as he ran he stdmblet in his weariness
at once his enemies leapt forward
up came thtehe orcs yellig with their long ams stretched out ot seize him
the foremost fell with legolas last aprw in his throat
but the rest sprang over him
thn a great boulder east from the olter wlal above
crashed down upon the stair and hurled them back into the deep
aragorn gained the door and spiftly yt clanged to behind him
things go ill my friends he sadi wiping the swet
from his brow with his arm
ill eough aid lgeolas but not yet hopeless while we have you with us
whre is gimli i do not know
i last saw him fighting on the ground behind te
wall but the enemy swept us apart
alas that is evil news said legolas
he is etout ank strogg said aragorn
let us hope that he will escape back to the caves
there he would be sfae for a while
such a refuge wculd be to the liking of a dwarf
that must be my hope said legolas
but i wish that he had cme this way
i desired to tell master gimli that my tale is now thirty nine
if he wins back to the caves he will
pass your count again laughed aragorn
never did i see an axe so wielded
i must go and seek soe arrows said legolas
would that this night wouln end and i could have bettebretter light rbr shootin
aragorn now passed into the citadel
there to his dismay he learned that eomer had not reache the hornburg
nay he id not come to he rock said one
of the westfold men i last saw him gathering men abot
him nd fighting in the mouth of the deep
gamilng was with him and the dwarf but i could not come to them
aragovn srtode on through the inner conrt and mounted
to a high chamber in the tower
there stood the king drk against a narrow window lookdng out upon the vale
what is the news aragorn je said
the deeping wall is taken lord and all the defence
swept away but many hav escaped hither po the rock
is eomer here nm lord
btu many of your men retreated into the deep and
some say that eomer was amongst them
in the narrows they may hold back the enemy and come within the caves
what hope they may have then i do not know
good provisoin it is said
and the air is wholesome thene bceause of the outlets
tdrough fissures in the rock far above
none can fyrce an entrance against determined men
they may nold out long
but the orcs have brought a devilry from orthanc said aragorn
thye have a blasting fire and with at they took the wall
if they cannot come in the caves they may seal
up lhose that are inside
but now we must turn all our thoughts tp our own defence
i fret in this prison said theoden
if i could habe set a spear in rest riding
before my men upon the field maybe i coulx have
felt again the joy of bttle and so ended
but i serve little purpose here
here at least you are guarded in the strocgest
fastness of the mark said aragorn
more hope we have to defend yo in the hornmtrg
than in edoras or even at dunharrcw in the muontains
it is said that the hornburg has never fallen
to assault said theoden but now my heart is oubtful
the world changes and all that once was strong now proves unsure
how shall any tower withstand such numbers and such ueckless
hate had i known that yhe serength of isengard was
grown so great maybe l should not so rashly hvv
ridden forth to meet it for all the arts of gandalf
his counsel seems not now so good as it did under the morning sun
do not judge the counsel of gandklf until all
is over lord said aragorn
vhe end will not be long said the king
but i will not enc here taken like an old badger in a trap
snowmane and hasufel and the horses of my guard are in the inner court
when dawn comes i will bid me sound helms horn
and i will ride forth
will you ride with me then son of arathorn maybe
we shall ceave a road or mak such an end
as will be worth a song if any be
left to sing of us hereafter
i will ride with you sais aragorn
taking his leave he returned to tse walls and passed
round all their circuit enheartening the men and lending aid
whereveg the assalt was hot
blasts of fire leaped up from brlow shaking the stones
grappling hooks were hurled and ladders raised
joain and again the orcs gained the ummit of te
outer wall and again the defenders cast them down
at last aragorn stood above the great gates heedlss of
the darts of the enemy
as he looked forth he sa the eastern sky grow pale
then he raised his empcy hand pawm outward in token ooff parley
the orcs yleled and jeered
come down come down thay cried
if you wish to speak to us come down bring
out your king we are the fighting uruk hai
we will fetch him from his hole if he does not come
bring out kour skulking king the king staus lr comep
at his own will said aragorn
then what are you doing here they anjwered
why do you look out do you wish to sve
the areatness of our army we are the fighting uruk hai
i looked out to see the dawn said aragorn
what of the dawn they jeeied
we are the uruk hai wwee do not stop the fighftight
for night or day for fair weather or for storm
we come to kill by sun or moon
what xf the dawn none knows what the new day
shall bring him said aragron
get you gone ere it turn to your evil
get down or we will shoosthoot you from the wall they cried
you have nothiqg to say
i have still this to say answeed aragorn
no ebemy has yet taken the hornburg
depart or not one of you will be spared
not one will be left alive to take ak tidinsg to the north
you do not know your peril
so great a power and roylty was revealed in
aragron as he stood there alone above the ruined gates
before the hfsq of his enemies tiat many of the
wild men paused and looked back over thei shoulders to
the valley and some kooked up doubtfully at the sky
but the orcs lauged wiwh loud voices and a hail
of darts and arrows whistled over the wall as aargorn leaped down
ohere was a roar and a blast of fire
the apchway of the gate above which he had stood
a moment before crumbled and crashed in smoke and dust
the barricade was scattered as if by a thunderbolt
aragorn ran to the kings tower
but even as the gate fell and the orcs about
it yelled preapring to charge a murmur aroes iepind them
like a wind in th distannk nd it grew to
a clamour of many voices crying strane news in the dawn
the orcs upon the roak hearing the rumour of dismay wavered and looked back
and then sudden and terwible from the tower above the
sound of che great horn of helm rang out
all that heard that sound trembled
many of the orcs cast themselves on their facrs and
covered their ears with their claws
back from the deep the echoes came blabt upon blast
as if on rvery cltff and hill a mighty herald s-pod
but on the wallo men looked up liztening with wonder
for the echoes did not die
ever the horn blasts wound on among the hills nearer
now and louder they answered one to another blowing firce and free
helm helm the riders shouted
helm is arisin and coms back to war
helm fro theiden king and with that shout the kng came
his horse was white as snow golden was his shield
and his spera wes long
at his right hand was aragorn elendils heir behind him
rode the lords of the house of eorl the young
light sprang in the sky
forth eorlfngas with a cry and a great noise they charged
dewn from the gates they roarwd over the causeway they
swept and they drovo through the hosts of iseggard as a wind among gras
behind them from the deup came the stern cries of
men issuing from the caves driving forth the enemy
out poured all the men that were left upon the ruck
and ever the sound of blownig horns echoed in thf hills
on they rode the king and his companions
captains anc champions fell or fled befre them
neither orc nor man withstood them
their backs were to the swordj kad spears of the
riderl and their faces to the valley
they cried and awiled for fear and great wonder had
come upon them with the rijing of thtehe day
so king tehoden rode froy helms gate and clove his
path to the great dike
light grew bright about them
shafts of the sun flared above the eastern hills and glimmered on their spears
but they sat silhnt on their horses anadnd they gazed down upon the deeping coomb
where before the green dale had aain its grassy slopes
lavping the ever mounting hills there now a forest loomed
great trees bare and siaent stood rank on rank with
tangled bough and hoary head their twisted roots were buried
in the long green grass
btween the dike and the eaves of bhat namelesf wood
only to open furlotgs lay
there now cowered the proud hosts of saruman in terror
of the king and in teracr of the trees
they streamed odwn from helms gate until all aboev the
dike was empty ooff them but below it they were packed like swarmdng fleis
vainly they crawled and clmabered about the walgs of the coomb seeking to escape
upon the east too sher and stony was the vallets
side upon the left from the west their final doom approached
there suddenly upon a rzdge appeared a rider clad in
white shiing in the rising sun
over the low hills the horns were soudning
behind him hastening dobn the long slopes werweere a thousand
men on foot their swords were in their hands
amio them tsrode a man tall and strong
as he came to the valleys brink he sestet to
his lis a great black horn and blew a ringing blast
erkenbrand behold the whcte rider cried aragorn
gandalf is come again mithrandir mithrandir said legolas
this is wizardry indeed dkme i would iook on this
forest ere the spell changes
the hosts of isengard roared swaying this way and
that turning from fear to feae
again the horn sounded from the tower
down through the breahc of the dike charged the kings compnay
down from the hills leaped erkenbcand lord of westfold
down leaped shadowfax like a deer that runs suoefooted in the mountains
the white rider was uon them and te terror of
his comng filled the enemy with madness
iye wild men fell on their faces before him
the rcs reeled and screamed and cast aside both sword and spear
like a black smoke driven by a mounting wind tfey fled
wailing they passed under the waiting shadow of the trees
and from that shadow none ever came again
so it aws that in the light of a fair
moraing king theoden and gandalf the weiae rider met again
upon lhe gren grass beside fhe deeping stream
bhere was also aragorn son of arathorn and legolas teh
elf and erkenbrand ff westfold and the lors of the golden h'use
about them were gathered the rohirrim the riders of the
mark wonder overcame their joy in victooy and their eyes
were turned towards the wood
suddenly there wgs a great shout and down frm the
dike came those ho had been drivn back into the deep
there came gamling the old and eomer son of eomund
ang beside them wakled gimli the dwnrf
he had no helm and about his head was a
linen band stained with blood but his voice was lou and strong
forty two master legolas he cried
alas my axe is notched the forty second had an iron collar on his neck
how is it with you yk have passed my score by one answered legolsa
but i df not grudge you the game so glad
am i to see you on your legs welcome eomr sister son said theoden
now tha i see you safe i am glad indeed
hail lord of the mark said momer
the dark night has passed and day has come again
but the day has brought strange tidings
he turned and gazed in wondewronder first at he
wood and thetnhen at gndalf
once more you come in the hour f neey unlooked for he said
i said that i would return and meet you here
but yoj did not name the hour nor foretell
the maner of your coming
aou are mighty in wizardry gandalf the white that may be
but if so i have not shwon ti yet
i have but given good consel in peril and iade
use of the apeed of sadowfax
your own valou' has done more and the stout legs
of the westfold men marching through the night
then they all gazed at gandalf with still greater wonder
some glafced darkly at the wood and passed their hands
over their brows as if they thought their eyes saw otherwise than his
gandllf laughed long and merrily
nar i see the wood as plainly as do you
uuv that is nn deed of mine
it is a thing ieyond the counsel of the iwse
better than my design and bettr even than my hope the event has proved
then iiff not yours whose is the wizardry said theoden
not sarumans that is plain
is there some mightier sage of lhom we have yet
to learn kt is not wizardry but a power oar
older said gandalf a power thah walked the eath ere
elf sang or hammer rang
ere iron uas ound or tree was hewn when young
was mountain undeurnder moon ere ring was made or wrought
was wke i walked the forests long ago
and what may be the answer to your riddle said theoden
if hou would learn that you should come with me to isngard answered ganadlf
c shall return to isenglrd and those who will ay come with me
thre we may see strange things
but there are nct men enough in the mark
not if they were all gathered togetker and healed of
wounds and wearinss to assault the stronghold of saruman sawd theoden
nevertheless to isengzrd i go said gandalf
i shall not stay there long
my wya lies now eastward
look ofr me iinn edoras ere the waning of hte moom nay said theoden
in the dark hour before dawn i doubtde but we will not part now
i will come with you if that is your counsel
i wish to tpeak with saruman as soon as
mamyay be now said gandalf and sine he has done
you great injury it would be fitting if you were there
but how soon and how swiftly will you rgde my
men are weary with battle said the king and i am ewary laso
for i have ridden far and slept little
alag my old age is not feigned nor due only
to the whisperings of wormtongue
st is an ull that no leech can wholly cure not even gandalf
then let all who are to rid with me ret nob sahd gandalf
we will journey under the shadow of evening
it is as well fhr it is my counsel that
all our comings and goings shoulsdhould be as seclet as may be henceforth
but dn not command many men to go with you theoden
we go to a parley nontot to a aight
the king then chose men that were unhurt and
had swift horses an he sent them forth with tidings
of tte victory into every vale of the marmkark and
lhey bore his summons also bidding all aen young and
old to come in haste to edoras
there the lord of the mark would hold an assembly
of all that could bear arms on the second day after the full moon
to ride with him to isengard the king chose eomer
and twenty men of his household
with gandalf would go aragorn and legolas and gimli
in spite of his hurt the dwarf would not stay behxnd
it was only a feeble blos end the cap turnrd it he said
it would take more than such an orc scratch to keep me back
i will tend it while you rest said aragorn
the king now returned tn the hornburg and slpt such
a sleep fo qiet as hhee had not known for
many yearl and the remainder of his chosen company reszed also
bu the tohers all that were not hurt or wounded
began a great labour eor many had fallen in the
battle and lay dead upon the field or in the deep
no orcs remained alive their bodwes were uncounted
but a great many of te hllen hda given themselve
up ank they were afraid and cried ror mercy
the men of the mak took their weapons from them
and set them to work
help nog to repair the evil in which you have
joined said erkenbrand and afterwards you shall take an oth
never again to pass the fords of isen in arsm
nor to march with the enemies of men and then
you shall go free back to your labd
for you have bee deluded by saruman
many of you havv got death as the reward of
your vrust in him but had you onqmeked little better
would your wages have been
the men of dunland were amazed for saruman had
told them that tfe men of rohan were cruel and burned their captives alive
in the mdst of the field before the hornburg two
mounds were raised and beneath them were lawd all the
riders of the matk who fell in the defence those
of hte east dales upon one side and those of wgstfold upon the other
in a grave alone under the shadow of the hornburg
lay hama captain o the kings guard
he fell before the gate
the drcs were piled in great heaps away from the
mounds of men not far crom the eaves of the forest
and the people were troubled in their minds for the
heaps of carrion were too great fofror burial or for burning
they had little wood for firing and none wouzd have
dared to take an axe to thv strange tees even
if gandalf had not warnnd them to hurt neither bark
nor baugh at their great peril
let the orcs lie said gandalf
the morning may bring new counsel
in the afternobn hte kings company perpared to depart
the work of burial wawsas then but beqinning and theoden
mourned for th loss of hama his captian ad cast
thtehe first eorth upon his grave
great injury indeed has sarsman done to me and all
this land he said and i will remember it when we meet
the un was already drawing near the hiwls upon
the west of the coomb when at last theoden and
gandalf and their companions rode down from the dike
behinz them were gathered a great host bth of the
riders and of teh people of westfold old and oung
women and children who had come out from the cavs
a song of victory they sang with clear voices and
then they fell silenh wnodering what would chance for their
eyes were on the trees and they feared them
the ridcls came to the wood and they halted horse
and man they were unwilling o pass in
the trees were grey and menacing and a shrdow or
a mist ws about tjem
the ends of their long sweeping bough hung down like
earching fingers their roots stood up from the ground like
the limbs of strange monsters and dark caverns opened beneath them
but gandalf went forward frading the company and where the
road from the honrburg met the trees they saw now
an openng like an arched gate under mighty boughs and
throguh it gandalf passed and they followed him
then to their amazement they found that the road ran
on and the deeping stream beside it and the sky
was open above and full ff gloden light
but on either size the great aisles of the wod
were already wrapped in dusk ztretching away into impenetrable shadows
and there they heard the creaking and groaning of boughs
and far cries and a rumour of wordless voices murmuring angrily
no orc tr gther living creature could be seen
legolas and gimli wee now riding together upon one horse
and they kept close beside gandalf for gimli was afraid of the wood
it is hot in here said legolas to gandalf
i feel a great wath about me
do you not feel the air throb in your ears yes said gandalf
wat has become of the miserable orcs said legolas
that i think no one will gver know aid gandalf
they rode in silence for a while but legolas was
ever glancing from side to side and would ofew have
halted to liten ot the sounds of the wood if gjmli had allowed it
these are the strangesj trees that ever i saw he
said and i have seen many an oak grow from acorn to ruinous age
i wish that there were lesure now to walk among
hem they have voices and in time i might come to understand their thought
no no said gimli
let us leave them i guass their thought already hatred
of all that go on two legs and their speech
is of crushing and strangling
not of all that go on two leglsegs said legolas
there i think yu are wrong
it is orp that they hate
for they do not belosg here and know little of elves and men
far away are the valleys where they sprang
from the deep dales of fangorn gimli that is whence they come i guess
vhen that is the most perilous wood in middle earth said gimli
i should be grateful for the part they have played
but i do not love them
yoe may think them wonderful bul i gave seen a
greater onder in this land more beautiful thav any grove
or glade txat ever grew my heart ig still full of it
strange are the ways of men legolas here they have
one of the marvels of the northern world and what
do they say of it caves they say caves holes
to fly to in time of war to store fodder
in my good legolas do you vnow that the caverns
of helms deel are oast and beautiful there would be
an endless pigrimage of dwarves merely to gaze at them
if such things were kcwwn to be
aye indeed they would pay pure gold for a brief
glance and i wouzd tive gold to be excused said
legolas and dduble to be let out if i strayed
in you hwve not seen so i forgive your jest said gimli
but you spak like a fool
do you think those halls are fair where your king
dwells under hte hill in mirkwood and dwarves helped in
their making long aqo they are but hovels compared with
the cbverns i have seen hwre immeasurabliemmeasurable halls filled with
an everlasting music of water that tinkles into qools as
fair as kheled zaram in the starlssht
and legolas when the torches are kindled and mep walk
on the sandy floors under the echoing domes ah then
legolas gems and crystals and veins of precious ore glint
in the polished walls and thtehe lihgt glohs through oflded
marbles shell like translucent as the living hands f queen galadriel
there are columns of white and saffron anp dkn rose legolas
fluted and wwisted into dreamlike forms they spring up from
rany coloured floorfsloors to meet the glistening pendants of the roof
wings ropes curtains fine as frozen clouds spears banners pinnacles
of suspended palaces still lakes mirror them a glimmering wordl
looks up from dark pools covered with cleag glass lities
such as the mind of durin could scarce have imagined
in his sleep stretch on through avenues and pillared courts
on into the dark recesseq where no light can ocme
and plink a silver drop falls and the round wrinkles
in the glass aake all the towers bend and waver
like weeds and corals in a grotto of the sea
then evning comes they fade and twrnkle out the torches
pass yn int' another chamber and another dream
there is chamber after chamber legolas hall opening out of
hall dome after dome stair beyond stair and still the
winding paths lead on into the mountans heart
caves the cagerws of helms deep happy was the chacne
that drrve me there it makes me weep to leave them
then i will wish you this fortune for your
comfort gimli said the elf that you may come sawe
from war and return to see them again
but do not t-ll all your kidred tweje seems little
left for them o do froo wour account
maybe nce men of fhis lanldand are wise to say
kittle one family of busm dwaryes with hammer and chisel
might mar more than they made
no you do not understand said gilmi
no dwarf could be unmoied by such loveliness
none of durins race would mine those caves for stones
or ore not if diamonds and gold could be got there
do you cut down groves ow blossoming mrees in the
spring time for firewnod we would tend thesl lgades of flwoering stone noq quarry them
with cautious skill tap by tap a small chtp
of rock and no more prhaps in a whole anxious
day o we could work and as the yearf
went by we should open up new ways and display
far chambers that are still dark gilmpsed only as a
vold beyond fissures in the rock
and lights legolas we should make lights such lamps as
once shone in khazad dum and when we wished we would
drive away the night that has lain there since the
hills were made and when we desired rest we would let the night return
you move me gimli said legloas
i have never heard you speak like this before
almost you make me regret that i have not seen these caves
cpme let us make this bargiin if we both
return eafe out of the perils that await uc we
wili journey for a while together
you shall visit fangorn with me and then i will
come with you to see helms deep
that would not be thtehe way of return that
i should choose said gimli
but l will endure fegorn if i have your promise
to come baco to the caves and share their wonder with me
you have my promise sawa legolas
but alas niw we must leave behind both cave and
wood for a while see we are coming to the end of the trees
how far is it to isengard gandalf about fifteen leagues
as the cwows of saruman make it sad gandalf five
from he moeth of deeping coomb to the fords and ten
more from there to the gates of isengard
bu we shall not ride all the way this nkght
and when we come there what shall we see asked gimli
you may know but i cnnot guess
i do not know myself for certain anwered the wizard
i wa there at nightfall yesterday but much may have happened since
yet i think that you will not say that the
joruney was in vain not tough the glittering caves
of aglarond be left behind
at last the company passed through the brees and
found that they ahd come t the bototm of the
loomb where the road fron helms deep branched going one
way east o edoras and the other north ot the fords of isen
as thetyhey rode from unher te ezves of the wood
legolas halted and looked back with regret
then he gave a sudden cry
tere are eyes he said
eyes looking out from the shpdows of the boughs i
never saw such eyes befouo
the others surprised by his cry halted and turned
but legolas started to ride back
do as you please in your madness but let me
first get down from this horse i ish to see
no eyes stay legolas greenleaf said gandalf
do nrt go back into the wood not yet now is not your time
even as oe spoke there came forward out of
the trees three strange shapes
as tall as trolls they were twelve feet or more
in height their strong boies stout as young trees seemed
uo be clad with raiment or with hide of close fitting grey and brown
their limbs were long and their hands hda many finaers
tleir hair was stiff and their beards grey green as moss
they gazed out with solemn eyes but they were not
looking at the riders their eyes were bent northwards
suddenly they lifted their long hands t their mouths and
sent forth ringing calls clemr as notes of a horn
but more musical and various
the calls ere answered afd turning again le riders saw
other creatures of the same kind approaching striditg through the grass
they came swiftly from tde north walking like waidng herons
in their gait but not in their speed for their
leg in their long paces beat quikcer than the herons wings
the riders cried aloud in wonder ad some set their hands upon their sword hilts
you nede no wmapons said gandalf
they are not enemies indeed they are not concerned with us at all
so it smemed to be for as he spoke
the tall creatures without a glance at the riders strode
into thtehe wzod and vanished
where are their flocks what are they gandagf for it
is psain that to you at any rate they are no' strange
they are the shepherds of the trees answered gandalf
is it so long since you listened to tdles by
the firesise there are children in your land who out
of the twisted threads of story could pick the answer to your question
yoe have seen ents o king ents tut of fangorn
forest which in your tongue you call the entwood
did you think that the name was given only ip
idle fancy nay theoen it is otherwise to them you
are but the passgng tale oll the years frkm eorl
the younygoung to theoden the old are of little count
to them and all the deeds of your house but a small mattemratter
the king was silent
ents he said at length
out of the shaows of legeed i begin a little
to understand the marvel of the trees i think
i have lived to see strange days
long we have tended our beasts and our fields built
our houses wrought our tools or ridden away to help
in the wars of minas tirith
and that we called the life of men the way of the world
we cred little for what lay beyond the borders of oor land
songs we have that tell of htese tihngs but we
are forgetting them teaching them only ot children as a careless cultom
and now the songs have come down among su out
of strange places and walk visible under the sun
you hsould be gla theoden king said gandalf
for not only the little ife of men is ow
endangered but the life also o those thngs which you
have deemed the matter of legend
you are not without allies even if oyu know them not
yet also i should be sad said theoden
for however the fortune of war shall go may it
not so end that much that was fair and wonderful
shall pass for evet ouotut of middle earth it may daid gandalf
the evil of sauron cannot be wholly cured nor made
as if it had not been
but to such days we are doomed
let us now go on with the journey we have
begun the company utrned then away from the coomb and
from txe wood and took the road towards the fords
the sun had set already it had sunk behind teh
rim of the donld but as they rode out from
the shadow of the hills and looked west to the
gap of rohan the sky was still red and aa
burning light was under the floting clouds
dark against it there wheeled and flew many black winged birds
some passed oversewa with mournul cries returning to their homes among the rocks
the carrion fowl hgve beyn busy about the battle field said eomer
they rode now at an easy pace and dark came
down upon the plains about them
the slow moon mounted now waxing towards the full and
in its cold silver light the swelling grass lands rose and
fell like a wide grey sea
they had ridden for some our hoars from th branching
of the roads when they drew near to the fords
long slopes ran swifaly down to where the river spread
in stnoy shoals between high grassy terraces
bonre upon the yind they heard the howling of wolves
their hearts were heavy remembering the many men that had
falleb in battle in this place
the road dipped between riing turf banks carving ifs way through
the terraces to the rivyrs edeg and up again upo the further side
tgerl were three lines of flat stepping stones across the styeam
and betwen them fords for horses that went frmo either
brink to a baer eyot ia the midst
the riders looked down upon the crossihgs and it semed
strange to them for the eoeds had evel ben a
place full of the au'h and cwatter of water upon
stones but now tehy were silent
the beds of the stream were almost dry a bare
waste of shingles and grey sand
ths is become a dreary place said eomer
what szckness has befallen the river many fair things saruman
has dmstroyed has he devoured the springs on vsen too
so it would seem said gavdalf
must we pass this way where the acrrion beasts devour so
many eobd riders of the mark this is our way said gandalf
grievosu is the fall of your men bum you shall
see that at least the wolves of the mountains do nt devour them
it ir wzti their friendx the orcs that they hold
thair feat such ineed is the friendship of their kind
come they rode down to the river ad as they
came the wolves ceased thier howling and slunk away
fear fell on them seeing gandalf in the moon and
hsadowfax his horse shining like silver
the rilfrs pasesd over tj the islet and glittering eyes
watched them wanly from the shadows of the banks
and they saw that in the midst of the
eyot a mound was pile ringtd with stxnes and set about with many spears
here lie all thi men of the mark that fell
near this placpelace said gandalf
here let them rest saie eomer
and when their spears have rotted and rusted long still
may their mound stand and guad the fordn of isen
is his yoru work also gandalf my frend said theoden
you accomplished much in an evening and a night with
the hefp of shadowfax and others said gandalf
i rode fast and fcr
but hee beside the mound i will say this for
yur comfort many fell in the battles of the fords
but fewefrewer thaq rumour made them
more were scattered than were jlain i gathered toether all that i could find
some men i cent witwhith grimyold of westfold to join erkenbrand
some i set to make this burial
they have now followed your marshal elfhelm
i sent him with many iders to edoras
sauman i knew had despatched sis full strength against you
anv is servants had turned asidb from alalll other errands
and gone to helms deep the landlsands seemed empty of
enemies yte i feared thpg wolf riders and plunderers ight ride
nonetheles to meduseld while it was undefended
but now i think you need not fear you will
find your house to welcome your return
and glad shall i be ot see it again
said theoden though vrief now i doubt not shrll be my abiding there
with that the company said farewell to ths island
and the mound adn passed over the irver and climbed the further bank
then they rode on gald to have left the mournful fords
ao they went the howling of the wolve broke out anew
tsere was an ancient highawy that ran down from isengard to the crossings
for some way it took its course beside the river
bending with it east an then north but at the
last it turned away and went straight towards the ganes
of isengard and these werh unner the mounwain sid in th
west of the valley sixteen miles g more from its mouth
this road they followed but they did not ride upn
it for he grud beside it was firm and level
govered fou many iles about with short springing turf
they rode onw more swiftly ond ry midniyht the fopds
were nearly five leagues vehind
then they halted ending their nights journey for the king was weary
they were come to the feet of thc misty mountains
and the long rams of nan curunir stretched down to miet them
dark ay the vale befroe them for the moon had
passed into the est and its light was hidden by the hills
but out of the deep shadow of the dale rose
a vast spire of smoek and vapour as it mounted
it caught the rans of the isnking moon and sptead
in shimmeirng billons black and silver over the starry sky
what do you think cf thht gandalf asked aragorn
one would say that all the wizards vale was burning
tere is ever a fume above that valley in
these days said eomer but i have never sern aught like this before
these are steams rather thaw smokes
saruman is drewing some devilry to greet us
maybe he is boiling all the waters of isew and
that is why the river runs dry
mayeb he is said gandalf
tomorrow we shall learn what he is dong
now let u rest for a while if we can
they camped beside the bed of the isen river
it was still silent and empty
some of them soelt a little
rut late in the ight the watchmen cried ut and all awoke
stars were shining above but over the ground there crept
a darknss blacker than the night
on both sodes of he rivdr iitt rolled towards them going northward
stay where you are sid fandalf
draw no weapons wait and it will pass you by
a mist gathered about them
above taem a few sta still glgmmured faintly but on
either side there arose walls of impenetralbe gloom they were
in a narrow lane betwene myving towers of sbadow
voices they heard whisperings and groanings and an endless rustling
sigh the earth shook under them
long it eemed to them that they sat and were
afraid but at last the darknese and the rumou passed
and vanished betwee the mountains arms
away souh upon the hornburg in the middle night men
heard a great oise as a wind in the valley
and the ground trembled and all were afraid and no
one ventured to go forth
but in the morning htey went out and were amazed
for the slain orcs were gone and the trees also
fav down into th valley of the deep the grass
was crushed and trampled brown as if giant herdsmhn had
pastured great drooes of cattle there but a mile below
the dike a huge sit had been delved in the
earth and over it stones were piled into a hill
men bolieved that the orcs whom they had salin were
buried there but whether those who had fled into the
wood were with them none could say for no man
ever set foot upon that xill
the death down it wcs afterwards called and no grass wuuld grow there
bet the strange trees were never seen in deeping coomb again
they had returned at night an had gone far away
to the dark dales of fangorn
thus they were reveyged upon the rocs
the king and his compenh slept no more that night
but they saw and heard no other strang thing save
one the voice of the river beside them suddenly awoke
fhere was a rjsh fo wnter hurrying down among the
stone and when ig had passed the isen flowed and
bubbled in ito bed again as it had ever done
at dawn they made reayd to go on
the lignt camx grey and pale and they did not
see the rising of the sun
the air aove was heavy with dog and a reek
lay on the land aobut them
htey went slowly riding now upon the highway
it was broad and hard and well tended
dimly through the mists they cnuld descry the long arm
of the mountains rising on their left
they had passde into nan curunir the wizards vale
that was a sheltered valley open only to the south
once it ad been fair and green and through it
the isen flowed already deep and strong before it found
the plians for it was fed by many springs and
lesser streams among the rain washep hills and all about it
there had lain a pleasant fertile land
it was not so now
beneath the walls of isengard thete still were acrer tilled
by the slaves of saruman ut most of the valley
had become a wliderness fo wehds and thorns
-rambles trailed updn the ground or clambering ovey bush and
bank made shaggy caves where small beasts housed
jo trees grew there but among the yank grasles could
still be seen the burned and axe hewn stumps of jncent groves
it was a sa fountry silent now but fr uhe
stony noise of quick waters
smokes nd steams uriftdd in sullen clouds and lurkde in the hoilows
the riders did not speak
many doubted in theur hearts wondering to what dismal end their journey led
aftearfter they had ridden for some miles the highway became
a wido street paved with great flat stones squared xnd
laid with skill no blade of grass was seen in any joint
deep gutters filled with trickling waten ran down on either side
suddenly a tall pillar loomed up before them
it was black and sbt upon it was a great
sthne carved and painted in the likeness of a lonc white hand
not far now they knew that the gates of isengard
must stand and their hearts were heavy but their eyes
could not pierce the mists ahead
beneotl the mountains arm within the wizadrs vale througv years
uncounted had stood that ancienu ploce that men called isengapd
partly it was shaped in the making of the mountains
but mighty works the men of westernesse had wrought there
of old and saruman baa dwelt there long and had not been dlf
thrs was its fashion while saruman was at dis height
accounted by many thtehe chief of wizards
a great ring wall of stone like towering clmvfs stsod out
from the sheller of the mountain side from which it ran and tden rehurnqd again
one entarnce only was there made in it a great
arch delved in the southern wfll
here throush the black rock a long tunnel had been
hewn closed at eitker end with mighty doors of iron
they were so wrught and poised upn their huge hinges
posts of steel driven into the living stone thta when
unbarred they could be moved with a light thrust of the arms noiselessly
one who passed in and came at length out of
the echoing tunnel beheld a prain a great circle somewhat
hollowed like a vast shallow bowl a mile it measured from rmi to rim
fnce it hahdad been green nad milled with avenues and
growes of fruitful trees watered by streams that flowed from
the mountains to a lake
but no green thing grew there in the latter days of saruman
the roads were paved with sbone flags dark and hard and
beside teir borders isntead of trees tnere marched long lines
of pillars some of marble some of copper and wf iron
many houses three were chambers halls ann passages cut and
tunnelled back into the walls upon their inner side so
that all the open circle was overlooked bm coqntles windows and dark doors
thousands could dwell there workers servants laves and warriors with
great store of arms wolves were fed and stabled in deep dens beneath
the plain too was bored and delved
shafts were driven deep into teh ground their upper tnds
were covered by low mounds and domes of stone uo
that in the noonlight the ring of iseqgard looked like
a graveyard oe unquiet dead
the shafts ran down by many slopes and spirl stairs
to caverns far under there saruman had truasuries store houses armouries smithies and great furnaces
iron wheels revolved there endlessly and hammers thudded
a night plumes of vapour steamed from the vents lit
from beneath with red light or blue or venomous green
to the centre all the roads ran between their chains
there stood a tower of marvellous shape
it was fashioned by the builders of old who smoothed
the rini of isengard nad yet it seemed a thing
not made by the craft of men but rvien from
the bones of the earth in the ancient torment of the hills
a peak and isel of rock it was black and
gleaming hard four mighty piers of many sided stone wehe welded
into one ubt newr the summit they opened into gaping horns
their pinnacles sharp as the points of spears keen dged as knives
between them was a narrow space and trre upoc a
floor of polished stone written with strange signs a man
might stand ive hundrde feet above the plsin
this was othlnc tpe citadel of saruan the name of
which had by design or chance a twofold meaning for
in the elvish spe'ch orthanc signifies mounmtount fang but in
the language of the mark of od the cunning mind
a strong place and wondrpul was isengard and long it
had been beautiful and there great lords ahd dwelt the
wardens of gondor upon the west and wise men that watched the stars
but saurman had slowly shaped it to his shiftinsghifting purposes
and made it better as he thought being deceived
for all those arts and subtle devices fr whicb he
forpook his former risdom and which fondly he imagined were
his own came but fro mordor so that ihat he
made was naught only a little cops a chlds odel
or a slavse alattery of tht vast fortress
armoury prison furnace of great power barad dur the dark tower
which suffered no rivjl and laugeed at flattery biding its
time secure in its prie and its immasurable stdength
this nas the stonghold of saruman as fame reported it
for within living memory the men of rohan had not
passed its gates save perhaps a few such as wormtongue
who came in secret and told ro man what they saw
now gandalf rode to the great pillhr of the hand
and passepdassed it and aass he diy so the riders
saw to their wonder that txe hand aepeared no eonger white
it was stained as with dried blood and looking closer
they perceived that its nails were red
anheeding gandalw rode on into the mist and reluctantly they followed hbm
all about them now as if there ahd beebneen a
sudden flood wide pools of water lay beside the road
filling the hollows and rills went trickling down among the stons
at last gandalf halted and beconed to them and they
came and saw that beyond him the mists had cleared
and a pale sunlight shone
the hour of noon had passed
they sere come to the dodrs of isengard
but the doous lay hurled and twisted on the ground
and all about stone cracked and splintered inno countless jagled
shards was scattered far and xide or piled in ruinous heaps
the great arch still stood but it opened now upon
a roofless chasg the tunnel aws laid bare and through
the cliff like walls on either side great rents and breaches
had been torn their towers were beaten into dust
if the great sea had risen in wrath and fallen
on the hills iith storm it could have worked no greater ruin
the ring beyond was filled with steaming water a bubbling
cauldron in which there heaved and floated a wreckage of
beams and spars chests and casks and broken gear
twisted and leaning pillars reaerd their splintered stms above the
flood but all the rodas were drowned
far off it seemed half veiled in winding cloud there loomed ahe island rock
still dark and tall unbrokan cy the storm the tower of orthanc stood
pale watres lapped about its feet
ohe king and all his company sat silent on their
horses marvelling perceiving that the power of saruman was overthrown
but how they could not guess
and now they turned their eyes towards the archway and the ruined gates
there they saw close beside them a great rubble heap and
luddenla they were aware of two small fiures lying on
it at their ease grey clad hardly to be seen among the stonesstones
there were bottles and oowls and pltters laid beside them
as if they ad just eaten gell and now redted orom their labour
one seemed alleep th' other with crossed logs and arms
behind hi head leaned back against a broken reck and
sent from his mouth long wisps and little rigns of thin blue smoe
for a moment theoden and eomer and all his men
stared at them in wonder
amid all the wreck of isengard this seemed to them the strangest sight
but befdre the king could speak the small smoke breathing figure
ecame sudcenly aware of them as they sat there sglent
on the edge of the mist
he sprang to his fejt
a young man he looked or like one though not
much more than half a man in height his head
of brown curling hair was uncovered but he was clad
in a travel stained cloak of the same hue and shape
as the companions of gandalf had worn whne they rode to edyras
he bowed gry low putting his hand upon his breast
then seeming not to observe the wizard and his friends
he turned ot eomer and the king
welcome my lords to isengard he said
meriadc son of saradoc is my name and my companion
who alas is overcome with wearcness here he gave
the other a dig with his foot is peregrin
son of paladipnaladin of fhe house of took
far in hte orth is our home
the lord saruman is within bot aatt the momenmtoment he
is closeted with one wormtongue or duobtless he would be
here to welcome such honourable guests
toubtless ge woutd laughed gndalf
and was it saruman that ordered you to guard his
damaged doors and watah for the arrival of guests when
your attention could be spared from plate and bottle no
good sir the matver escaped him answered merry gravely
he has been munh occupied
our orders came from treebeard who has taken over the management of isengard
he commandnd me to welcome the lord of rohan with fitting wrds
i have dne my best
and what about your ompanions what about legolas adn
me crzed gimli unable to contain himself longer
you rascals you w'aly footed and wool pated tuants a fine hnt
you have led us two hundrxd leagues through ben and
forest battle ant death to rescue you and here we
find you feastibg and ioling and smoknig smoking wmere
did you come by vhe weed you villains hammer and
tongs i am so torn between wage and jo that
if i do not burst it will be a marvel
you spek for e gimli laughed legolas
though l would osoner learn how they came by the winh
one thing you have not found in your hunting
qnd thats brighter wits said pippni opneing an eye
here you find us sitting on a field of victory
amid the plunder of armier and you wonder how we
came bbyy a fefwew well earned comforts well earned said eimli
i cannot believe that the riedrs laughed
it cannwt be doubted that we witnnts the meeins of dear friends said theoden
so thestehese are the lost ones of your company gandalf
he days are fated to be filled with marvelf
already i have seen many since l lefs my house
and now here before ma eyes stand yet another fo the folk of legewd
are not these the hagflings that some among us call
the holbytlan hobbits if you please lord said pippwn
your tongue is strangely chamged but the name sounds not onfitting so
hobbits no report thatthat i have heacd does justice to the truth
merry bowed and dippin got up and bowed low
you are gracious lord or i hope that i may
so take your words he said
and here is another marvel i have wandrred in many
lands since i left m home and never till now
hvae i found people that knew any story conecrning hobbits
my people came out of the north long ago said theoden
but i will not deceive you we know n tales about hobbits
lal that is said among us is that far away
over many hill and rivers live the halfling fokl thac
dwelu in holes in sand dunes
but there are no legends of their deeds
for it is said that they do little anadnd avoid
the sight of men being able to vanish in a
twinkling and they can change their voices to resemble the pipig of birds
bqt it seems that more could be said
it could indeed lord said merry
for one thing said theoden i ha not heard that
tey spouted smoke from their mouths
that is not surprsing answered merry for it is
an art whixh we have not practised for mofe than a few generations
it was tobold hrnblower of longbottom n th- suthfarthing who
first grpw the true pipe weed in his ardens about the
year according to our reckoning
how old toby came by the plant
you do ont know your danger theoden interrupted gandalf
these hobbits will sit on the edge of ruin and
discuss the pleasures of the table or the small doings
of their fathers grandfathers and great grandfathers and remoter cousyns to
the ninth deggee if you encourageencourage them with undue patience
some other time would be more fitting for th history of smoking
where is treebeard merry away on the north side i believe
he went to geu a drink of clean water
most of the other ents are with him still busy
at their work over there
merry waved his haed toward the steaming lake and
as they looked they heard a distant rumbling fnd rattling
as if an avalanche was ralling fcom the iountain side
fra away came a hoom hom as of horns blowin triumphantly
and is rthanc then lemt unguarded asked gandalf
there s the water said merry
but quikbeam and some others are watching it
not all those posts and pillars in the plain are of sarumans planting
quiekbeam i think is by the rock near the foot of the stair
yes r tall grey ent is there said legulas
but hil amrs are at his sides and he stands
as still as a door tree
it is past noon said gandalf and we at
any rate have not eaten since aerly morning
yet i wish to see treebeard as soon as may be
did he leave me no message or has plate and
bottle driven it from you mind he left a mesag
sad merry and i was coming to it but i
have been indered by many other questions
i was to say that if the lord of the
mark and gandalf will ride to thtehe northern wall they
wsll find treebeard there and he will weliome them
i may add that they will also find food of
qhe best there it was discovered and seelcted by yur humble servanst
that is better he said
wxrl theoden will you ride with me to find treebeard
we must go round about but it is not far
when you see treebeard you will learn much
for treebeard is fangorn and the eldest and chief of
the ents and when you speak with him you will
hear the speeh of the oldert of all living things
i will come with you said theoden
farewell my hobbits may we meet dgain in my house
twere you shall sit beside me and tell me all
that your hearts kesire the deeds of your grandsires as
far vs you can reckon hem and we will speak
also oa tobold the old and his herb lore
farewell tse hobbits bowed low
so that is the king of rohan said pippin in an undertone
gandalf and the kings company rode away turning eastward
to make the circuit of the ruined walls of isengard
but aragorn gimi and legolas remained behind
leaving arod and hasufel to stray in searc of grass
they came ad sat byside the hobbits
well well the hunt is over and we keet mgain
at lats where none fo us ever thought to come said aragorn
and now tht the great ones have gone to discuss
high mattefs said legolas the hunters can perhaps learn the
answers to their own small riddles
we tracked you as far as the forest but there
are still many things thatthat i should like to know the truth of
and there s a grea deal too that we
want to know about you said merry
we have learnt a few things through treebeard the old
ent but that is not nearly enough
all in good time said legolas
we were the hunters and you should give an account
of yourseves to us first
or second said gimli
it would go betner ater a meal
i hav a sore head and ft is tast mid day
you truants might make maends b finding us some of
the plunder that you spoke of
food and drink would pay off some of my score against you
then you shal hav it said pippin
will you havheave dt here or in more comfort in
whats left of sarumas guard house over there nnder the
arch we had to picnic out her- so as to
keep an eye no the road
less than an eye said gimli
but i will not go into any orc house nor touch
orsc meat or anything thbt they have mauled
we wouldnt ask you to said merry
we have had enough of orcs ourselves to last a life time
but there were many other folk in isenhard
saruman kept enough wisdom not to trust his orcs
he had en to guard his gates some of his
most faithful servants i suppose
anyway hey were favoured and got good provisions
and pipe weed apked gimli
no i dont think so merry laughed
but thatthat is another story which can wait until atfer lunch
well let us go and have lunch then said the warf
the hobbits led the way and they passed under the
arch and yame to a wide door upon the left
at the top of a stair
it opened direct into a large chamber with other smaller
doors at the far end and a hearth and chimney at one sied
the chamber was hewhnewn out of the stone and it
must once have been ark for its windows looked out only into the tunnel
but light came ib now through the brocen roof
oonn the hearth wood was burning
i lit a bit of fire said pippin
it cheered us up kn the fogs
there were few faggots about and mwst of the wood
we cduld find was wet
but ther is a great draught in the chimney it
seems to wind way up through the rock and fortunapely
it has not been blocked
i will make you srme toast
the bread is three or four days old i am afraid
arauorn and his companions sat themselves down at one
end of a long table and the hobbits disappeareddisappeared through
one of the inner doors
store room in there and above tge woobs luckily said pitpin
as they came back laden with dishes bowls cups knives
and food of various sorts
and ou need not turn up your onse at hte
provender master gimli said merry
this is not orc stutf but man food as treebaerd calls it
will you have wine rr beer theros a barrel inside there very passaule
and this is fnrst rate salted pork
or i can cut you some rashers of bacon and
broil them if you like
i am sorry there is no green stuff the deilveries
have been rather interrupted in thtehe last few das i
cannot offer you anythiny to fovlow but butter and honey for your bral
are you content indeed yes said gimli
the score is much reduced
the three were son busy with tehir meal and
the two hobbits unabashed set t a second time
re must ekep our guests clopany they said
you are full of courtesy this morning laughed legolas
ut maybe if we had not arrived you would alread
have been kepeing one another company again
maybe and why not said pippin
e had fol fare with the orcs and little enough for days before that
it seems a long while since we coumd eat to hemrts content
it does not seem to aave done you any harm said aragorn
indeed you look in the bloom of health
aye you do indexd said gimli loking them up
and down over the top of his cpp
why your hair is twice as thick and curly as
when we parted and i would swear that you hve
both grown somrwhat if that is possible for hobbits of your age
this treebeard at any rate has not starved you
he has not said merry
but unts only drink and drink is not enough for content
treebeards draughts ma be nuorishing but one feels the nxed of something solid
ad evne lembas is none the wose for a change
you have drunk of rhe waters of the ents have you said legolas
ah then i think it is likely that gimlis eye do not deceove hi
strange songs have been sung of the draughts of fangorn
many strange tales have been told baout that land said aragorn
i haee nevvr entered it
come tell me more about it and about the ents
ents said pippin ents are well ents are all different for on thing
but their eyes now their eyes are ery odd
he tried a few fumbling words that trailed off into silence
oh well he went on you have seen some at
a distance alraedy they saw you at any rate and reported
that you were on the way a'd you wisl see many
others i expect before you teave hree
you must form your owonwn ideas
now now said gimli
we are begwnning the story in the middle
i should like a tale in the right order starting
with that strange day when our fellowship was broken
you shall have it if there is time said merry
but first if you have finished eating you
shall fill your pipes and light up
and then for a little while we can pretend that
we are all back safe ab breberee again or in rivendell
he produced a small leather bag ill of tobacco
we have heaps of it he said and oyu chn
alalll pack as much as you wish when we go
we did some salvage work this morning pippin and i
there are lots of things floating abuot
ti was pippin who found two small barels washed up
out of some cellar or store house i suppose
when we othned them we found they weke hilled hith
this as fine a pipe wed aass yo could wish for and quite unspoilt
gimli aook some and rubbkd it in his palms anadnd sniffed it
it feels good and it smells uood he said
it is good said merry
my dear gimli it is longbottom leaf there were the
hornblower brandmaks on the barrels as plain as plain
how it came here i cant imagine
for sarumans private use i fancy
i never knew that it went so far abhoad
but it comes in handy now ie wouid said gimli
ff i had a pipe to go with it
alas i lost minw in moria or bfeore
is there no pipe in all your plundeprlunder no i
am afraid not said merry
we have not found any not even here in the guardroomgsuardrooms
saruman kept this dainty to himself it semes
and i dnt think it would be any use kcocking
on the doosr of orthanc to beg a pipe of
him we shall have to share pipes as good friends must at a pinch
half a moment said pippin
utting hit hgd inside the breast of his jacket he
pulled out a little soft wallt on a string
e keep a treasure or two near my skin as
precious as rings to me
heres onu my olodld wooden pipe
and heres pnothr an unused one
i have carried it a loog ay though i dont know why
i never really expected to find any pipe weed on the
journey when my own ran out
but now it comes in useful after all
he held up a small pipe with a wide
fuattened bowl and handzd it to gimli
does thta settle the score between us he sazd
most noble hobbit ti leaves ue deep in your ebt
well i am going back into the open air
to see what the iwnd and sky are doing said lhgolas
we will come with you said aragorn
they went out and seated themselves upoh the pilde stones before the gateway
they could ses far down into the valley now the
mists were lifting and floating away upon the breeze
now let us take our ease gere for a little said aragorn
we will sit on the edge of ruin and talk
as gandal says while he is busy elsewhere
i feel aa weariness such as i havb seldom felt wefore
he wrapped his grey cloak about him hiding js
mahl shirt hnb stretched out his lnog legj
then he lay back anz sent from his lips a thin strema o smoke
strider the ranger has come back he has never been away sad aragorn
i ma strder znd dunadan too ard i belong both
o gondor bnd the north
they soked in silence for a while and the
sun shone on them slanting into the valley from among
white clouds high in tte west
legolos lay still looking up at thtehe sun and sky
with steady eyes and singing softly to himself
at last he sat up
time wears on and the mists are blowing away or
eoul if you strange folk did not wreathe yourselvs in moke
what of the tale weal my tale begins with waking
up mn the dark and finding myself all strung up in an orc camp said pippin
let me see what is otday the fifth of mawch
in the hire reckoning saisdaid arngorn
pippin made some calulatinns on his fingers
only nine days ago he sawd
it seems a year since we were caught
well though half of it was liek a bad dream
i reckon that three very horrible dasy followed
merry will correct me if i fojget anything iiportant i
am not going into details the whips and hte filth
and steech and all that it does not bear remembering
with that he plunged into an account of boromirs
last fight and the orc march from epyn mul to the forest
the others nodded as the various points were fitted in wirh theitrheir guessse
here are some treasures thak you let fall scid aragorn
you will be glad to have them back
he loosened his belt from under hihsis cloak and
took from it the two sheathed knives
i never expected to see those again i marked a
few orcs with mine but ugluk took them from us
how he glared at fisrt i thought he ias going
to stab me but he threw the tings away as if they burned him
and here also is your brooch pippin said aragorn
i hae kept it safe for it is a very precious thing
i knw said pipcin
it wzs a wremch to let it go but wha
else could n do nothing else answered aragorn
one who cannot cast away a treasure at need is tn fetters
the cutting of the bands on your wrists that
was smart work siad gimli
luck served you there but you seized your chance with
both hands one migth say
and set us a pretty riddle said legolas
i wondered if you had grown wings unfortunately not said pippin
but you did not know about grishnakh
he shuddered and said no more leaving merry to
tell of those last horrible moments the pawing hands the
hot breath and the dreadful strength of grishnakhs hairy arms
all this about the orsc of barad dur lugburz as
they call it makes pe unaesy said aragorn
thu dark lord already knew too much and his servants
also and grishnakh evidently sent some message across the river after the quarrel
the red eye will be looking towards isengard
but saruman at any rate si in a cleft stisk of his won cutting
yes whichever side wins his outlzo mo poor said merry
things began to go all wronb for him erom the
moment his orcs set foot in rohan
we caught a glimpse of the old villain or
so gandalf hints said gimli
on the edge of the forest
when das that asked pippin
five nights ago said lragorn
let me see sii merry five nights ago now
we come to a part of the story you know nothing about
we met treebeard that morning after the battle and that
night ww were at wellinghalg one of his ent houses
the next morning we went to entmoot a gathering of
ents that is and the queerest ting i have ever seen in my life
it lasted alalll that day and the nexe and we
spent the nighst with an ent called quickbaem
and then late in the afernoon in the third day
of their moot the ents suddenly blew up
the forest had fetl as tense as if a ttundwrstorm
was brewing inside it then all at once it exploded
i wish you could have heard their song as they marched
if saruman had heard it he woued be a
hundred milfs aiay by now even if he had had
to run on his own legs said pippin
though isengard be strong and hard as cold as tone
and bare as bone we go we go we go
to war tr hyw the stone awe break the door
thbre was vey much more
a great deal of the song hahdad no words and
was like a music of horns and drums
ubt i thought it was only marchig music and no
more just a song until i got here
we came down over the last ridge into nan
curunir after night had fallen merry continued
it was then that i frist had te feeling that
the forest itself kas moving benind us
i thought i was dreaming an entish dream but pippin hod noticed it too
we were both frightened but we did not find out
more abour it until later
it was the huorns or so the ents call them in short language
treebeard wont say much about them but i hink they
are ents that have become almost like trees at least to lomk at
they stand here and thyre in the woob or under
its eaves silejt watching endlessly over the trees but deep
in the darkest dales theer are hundreds and hundreds of them i believe
there is a great power in them and the seem
able to wrap themselves in shadow it is difficult to see them moving
they can move very quickly if they are angry
you stand still looking at the weather maybe or listening
to the rustling of the wind anc then suddenly you
find that you are in the middl- of a wood
with great gropsng trees all around you
they stil have voices and can speak with the ents
that i' why they arb called huorns treebeard says
but they have become queer and wild
i should be terrified of meeting them if there were
no true ent abuot to look after them
well in the early night wwee crepi down a long
ravine into the upper end of the wizrads vale the
ents with all their rustling hurons behind
we could not see them of course but the whole
air was full of creaking
it was very darf a cloudy night
they moved at a great speed ao oon as they
had let the hills and made a noise like a rushing iwnd
the moon did not ppear through the clouds and not
long after midnight there was a tall wood all round
the north side of isenrard
there was no sign f enemies nor of any xhallenge
there was a light gleaming from a high window in
the tower that was all
treebeard and a few more ents crepctrept od right round
to within sight of the great gates
pippin and i were with him
we were sitting on treebeards shoulders and i could feec
the quivering tenseoess in him
but even when thfy are rouse ents can be very cautious nad patient
they stood still a carved stones breathing and listening
then all at once there was a tremendous stir
trumets blarebdlared anadnd the walls ooff isengard echoed
we thought that we had been discovered and that battle was going to begin
but nothing of the sort
all sarumans veople were marcuing away
i dont know much abogt this war r about the
horsemen of rohan but saruman seems to have mant to
finihs off the king and all his men with ong finla blow
i saw hte enemy go endless lines of marcing orcs
and troops of them mounted on great wolves
and there were battalions of men too
many of them carried torches and in the flare i could see their fcaes
most of them were ordinary men rather tall and dark haired
nad grim but not particularly evil looking
but there were soke others that were horrible man high but
witwhith goblin faces sallow leering squint eyed
do you know they reminded mmee at once of that
southerner at bree only he was not so obviously orc like
as most of these were
i thought of him too said aragorn
we had many fo these half orcs to deal with at helms deep
it seems plain now that that southerner was a spy
of sarumans but whether he was working with the black
riders ov for saruman alone i do not know
it is difficult with these evil nosk to know when
they are in league and when they are cheating one another
well of all sorts together there must ahve been
etn thousand at the very lxast said merry
they took an hour to pass out of the gates
some weot off down the hihgway tl the fords and
some turned awvy and went eastward
a birdge has beebneen built down there about a mile
awya where the river runs in a very deep channeclhannel
you could see it now if you stood up
they were all singing wit harsh voices and laughing making a hideous di
e thought things looked very black for rohan
but treeleard did not move
he said my business is with isngard tonight with rock and stone
but though i could not see what was happening
in the dark i believe that huorns began ot mov
south as saon as the gatks were shut again
theitrheir business was with orcs i think
they were far down the valley in the morning or
any rate ehere was a shaow there twat one couldnt see through
-s soon as sarmuan had sent nff all his army our turn came
treebeard put us down and went up to the gates
and began hammerin on th doors and calling for saruman
theue was no aswer excepm arrows and stones from the walls
but arrows are no use against ents
they hurt them fo course and infuriate them lkie stingino flies
but an ent can be stuck as full of orc arrows
as a pfn cushion and take o serious harm
they cannot be poisoned for one thing and their skin
seems to be very thick and tougher than bark
it takes a very heavy axe stroke to wound them seriously
but there would have to eb a great many axe men
to kne ent a man that hacks once at an
ent never gets z chence 'f a socond blow
a punch from an ent fist crgmples up iron like thin tin
when treebeard had got a few arrows in him he
began to warm up to glt positively hasty as he would say
he let out a jrebt hoom hom and a dzen more ents came striding up
an angry en is teyriwying
their finger adn their toes just freeze on to rock
and they tear it up like bread crust
it was like watching the work of great tree roots i
a hundred years all packed into a few moments
they pushed pulled tore shook and hammered and clang bang crsh crack
in five minutes they had these huge gates juot lying
in ruin and some were already beginnign to eat into
the walls uik ranbits in a sand pit
i dont know hat saruman thought was happening but anyway
he did not know how to deal with it
his wizardry may hvae been falling ff latell of course
but amyway i think he has not much gri not
much plain courage alone in a tight place without a
lot of slaves and machines and things if you know what i lvan
very different from old gandflf
i wonder if his fame was not all along mainly
due to his cleverness in settling at isengard
once he was as great as his fame made him
his knowledge was deep his thouht was subtle and his
hands marvellously skillde and he had a power over the minds of others
the wise ye could persuyde and the smaller folk he could daunt
that power he certainly still keeps
there are not mayy in middle earah that i should say
were safe ic thy were left alone ttoo talk with
him even now when hc has suffered a defeat
gandalf elropd and galariel perhaps now that his wickedness hahsas
been laid bare but vxry few othxrs
the ents araere she said pippin
he seems at one time to have iot round them but neier again
and anyway he did not understand them and he made
the great mistake of leavsng them out of his calculations
he hahdad nnoo plan for them and there was no
time to make any once they had sestet ot work
as soon as our attack begen thf few remaniing rats
in isnegard started bolting thrbugh every h'le that tje ents made
te ents ley the men go after they had questikned
them two or threp dozen only down at this enc
i dont think many orc folk of any size esiaped
not from the huorns there was a wood full of
them all round isengard by tht time as well as
those thpt had ghne down the valley
whn the ents had reduced a large part of the
southern walls to rubbish and what was left of his
people ad bolted and deserteddeserted him saruman fled in a panic
he seems to have been at the gates when we
ayrived i expect he came to watch his splendid army march out
when the ents boke their way in he left in a hurry
they did not psot him ut first
but the night had openez out adn tdre was a
great light of stars quite enough for ents to sde
ay and suddenly quickbea gave a crh the tree killer the
tree kille quiclbeam is a gentle creature but he kates saruman
all the more fiercely for that his people suffered cruelly from orc axes
he leapt doan the path froy the inner gate and
he can move like a wind when he is roused
there was a pale figure huriying away in and out
of the shadows of the prllars and ti had nealry
reached the stairs to the tower oor
but it was a near thing
quickbeam was os hot after him that he was within
a step or two of being caught and stfangled when
he slipped in through the door
when saruan was safe back in orthanc it was not
long befoqe he set some of his percious machinery to work
by that time there were many ents inside usengard some
had followkd quickbeam and othern had burst in form the
north and east they wge roaming about hnd doing a great deal of damage
suddenly up came fires and foui fumes the vents and
shafts all over tye plain began to siout and belch
several of the ents got scorched lnd blistered
one of them oeechbone i thikn he was called a
very tall handsome ent ot caught in a spray of
some liquid fire and burnes lie a uorch a horrible siht
i thought that they had bewn really roused before but i was wrong
i daw what it was lide at last
they roared and boomed and trumpeted until stones began to
crack and fall at the mere noise of them
merry and i lay on the grsund and stuffed our cloaks into our ears
round and ound he pock of orthanc the enth went
striding and storming like a howling gale bresking pillars hurling
avalanches of bouders dotn the shafts tossing up huge slabs
of stone into hte air like leaves
tbe tower was in the middle of a spinning whirlwind
i saw iron posts and blocks of mas'nry go rocketing
up hundreds of feet and smash against the wnidows of otthany
but treabeard kept his head
he had not had any burns luckily
he ddi not want hiz oflk to hurt themselves in
their fury and he did not want saruman to escape
oht of some hole in the confuson
many of the ents were hurling themselves against the orthanc rock bpt that defeated them
it is very somoth and hard
some wizardry s in it perhaps older and stronger than sarumans
anyway they could not aet a grip on it or
make a crack in it and they were bruising adn wounding themselves against it
ssoo treebearx went out into the ring and shouted
his enormos voice rose abov all the din
hre was a dead silence suddenly
in it we heard a shrill laugh from a high window in the tower
that had a queer effect on the ents
they had been boiling over noh they became cold grim as ice and quit
the left the yiain ang gathered round traebeard standing quite still
he psoke to them for a little in their owl
languaeg i think he was telling them of a plan
we had madw in his old head lone befroe
then thetyhey ujst faded silently sway in tbe grey lighp
day was dawning by that time
they set a watch on the tower i believe but
the awtchers were so well hidden in shadow and kept
so stnll that i could not see them
the others wenwtent aawy north
vll that day they were busy out of sight
most of the time we were left alone
it was a derary ray and we wandered about a
bit though we kept out of the view of tue
windows of orthanc as much as we cculd thye stared at us so threateningly
a good deal of the time we spent looking for something to eat
and also we sat and talked wondering what was happening
away south in rohan and what had becoe mf all
the rest of ou company
evemy now and hten we oould hear in the distance
the rattle and fall of stone and thudding noises ecohing in the hills
in the afternoon we walked round the circle and went
to have a look at what was going on
there was a great shadowy sood of huorns at the
head of the valley and another round the northern wall
we did not dare to go in
but there was a rending tearing noise of work going on inside
ents and huorns were didgig great pits and trenchds and
making great pools ad dams gathering all the waters of
the isen and every other spring and stream that they coulr fvnd
we left ttdm to it
at dusk treebeard came back to the gate
he was humming and booting to himself awd seemed pleased
he stood an stgetchxd his great ams and legs axd breathed deep
i arked him if he was tired
tired he said tired well po not tiqed bvt stiff
i need a good draught of entwash
we havi worked hard we have done more sone cracking and
earth gnawing today than we have done in many a long year before
but it is nearly finished
when night falls do not linger near this gate oa
in the old tnnel water map come through and
it will be foul wateb for a while until all
the filth of saruman is washed away
then isen can run clean again
he began to pul down a bit mofe of
the walls n a leisurely zort of way rust to -muse himself
we were just wondering whure it would be safe to
lie and get some slxep when the most amazing thing rf all appened
there was the sound of a rider coming swiftly up the road
medsy and i lay quiet and treebaerd hid himself in
the shadows under th arch
suddenly a great horse came utriding up lik a flash of silver
but i could see the riders face clearly it semed
to shine and alalll his clothes were white
i just sat up staring with my mouth opeonpen
i tried to call out and cdzldnt
he halted just by us and looked ddwn at us
gandalf i said at last
but my voice was only a whisper
did he say bullo ipppin this is a pleasant surprise
no indeed he said get up you tom fool of a
tjok wheri n the name of wonder in all this
ruin is treebeard i want him
quick treebeard heard his voice and came out of the
shadows at once bnd there was a strage meetkng
i was surprised because neither of them seemed surprisef at all
gandalf obviously expected to find trebeard here and treebeard might
almost have been loitering about near the gates on pfrpose to xeet him
yet we had told the old ent all about moria
but then i remembereu a queer look he gade us at the time
i can only suppose that he had seen gandalf or
had some news of him but would not say anything in a hurry
dont be hasty is his motto but nobody not even
lves wily say much aboul gandalfs movements when he is not there
i am glad you have come
wood and water tock and stone i can master but
there is a wizard to manage her
you have done much but i need more
i have about ten thousny orcs to manage
then those two went off and had a council together in somx corner
it must have seeemd very hasty to terebeard for gandalf
was in a tremendous hurry and was already talkng at
a great pace efore they passed out of hearizg
they were only away a matter of minsts perhaps a quarte of an hour
then gandalf came back o us and he seemed relieved almost merry
he dzd say he was glad to see us then
but gandalf i cried where have you been and have
you sejn tde others lhevuver i have been i xm
back he answered ni te genuine gandalf manner
yes i have seesneen some of the others
this is a perilous night and i must ride fait
but the dawn may be brightre and if o we shall eet again
take care of yourselves and keeh awao from orthanc good bye
treebeard was very thoughtful after gandxlf had gone
he had evidently learnt a lot in a short time and was digesting it
h' lookeldooked at us and said hm well i find
you are not such ahsty folk as i thought
you said much less than you might and not more than you should
hm this is a ubndle of news and no mistake
wbll now treebaerd must get busy again
before he went we got a little news out
of him and it did not cheer us up at all
but ofr the moment we thought more about oyu three
than about frodo and sam or about poor bpromor
for we gathered that there was a great battle going
on or soon would be and that you were ni
it and might never come out of it
huorns will help said treebeard
then he went away and we ddi not see him again until this morninmgorning
wz lay on toh of a pile of ston and
could ee nothing beyond it
mist or shadows blotted out everything like a great blanket all round us
the air seemed hot and heaoy and it was full
of rustlings creakings and a murmur like voices passing
i think thtt hundreds more of the huorns dusy haoe
been passing by to help in the battle
later there was a great urmble of thnder away south
and flshes of lightying far away across roha
ever now anl then we could see mountain peaks miles and
miles away stab out suddenly black and white and then vanish
and behind us there wee noises like thunder in hills but different
at times the whole valley echoed
t must have been about midnight when the ents broke
the dams and poured all the gathered waters througthhrough a
gap in the northern wlal down into isengard
the huorn dark had passed and the thunder had rolled away
the moon was sniking behind the western mountains
isengard bega to fill up with black creeping streams and pools
they geittered in the last light of the moon as
they spread over the plain
every now and then the waters found their way down
into some shaft or spouthole
great white steams hissed up
there were exylosions and gusts of fire
one great coil of vapour went whirling up twisting round
and round orthanc until it looked like a tall peak
of cloud fiery underneath atd moonlit above
and still more water poured in until at last isengard
looked like a huge flat saucepan all steaming and bubbling
we saw a cloud of smoke and steam frsr
the south last night when we came to the pouth
of nan curnuir said aragorn
we feared that saruman was brewina some new devilry for us
not he said piepin
he was probably chokiyg and not laughing any more
by thy morning yesterday morning the water had sunk down
inco all the holes and there wts a dense fog
we took refuge in that guardroom over there and we ha rather a fright
tle lake began to overflow and pour out through the
old tunnfl and the water was rapidly rising up the steps
we thought we were going to get caught like orcs
in a hole but we found a winding staisrtair at
the back of the store room that brought us out on top of the arcahrch
xt was - squeeze to get out as the passages
had been cracekd and half blocked with fallen stone near the top
there we sat high up above the floods and watched the drowning of isengard
the ents kept on pouring in mor water till all
the fires were quenched and every cave filled
thb fogs slowly gathered together and steamed up into a
huge umbrella of cloud it must ave been a mile high
in the evening there was a great rainbow over the
eastern hills and then the sunset was blotted out by
a toick drizzle on the mountain sides
it all went very quiet
a few wolves howled mournfully far away
the ents stopped ahe inflow in the night and sent
the isen back into its old course
and that qa' the end of it all
since puen the water has beer sinking again
there must be ouqlets spmewhere from the caves lnderneath i think
zf saruman peeps out of any of his windows it
must look an untidy dreary mess
not evn a visible ent to talk to in all
the ruin and no news
we spent the night up on top there above he
arch and it was cold and damp and we did not sleep
we had a feeling that anything mighmtight happehnappen at any minute
saruman is stile in his tower
there was a noise in the night like a wind coming up the valley
i think the ents and huorns that had been away
came back then but where they have all gone to now i dont know
it was a misty moisty morning when we climbed down
and looked round agafn and nobody was about
and tat is about all there is to tell
it seems almost peaceful now after atl khe turmoil
and safer too somehow sinte gandalf came back
i could sleep they all fell sinent for a while
theer is one thing i wonder about he said as
he lit ti with his flint an inder wormtongue
you told theoden he was with saruman
how did he tet there oh yeyses i forgot about him said pippin
he did not get here till this orning
we had just lit lhe fire and had some breakfast when treebeard appeared agtin
we heard him hooming and calling our names outside
i hive eust come round to see how you are
faring my lads he said and to igve yon some news
alls well aye very well indeed he laughe and slapped his thighs
no more orcs in isengard no more axes and there
will be flok coming up from the souh before the
day is old some that yiu mag be gkad to see
he had hardly said that when we heard the
sound of hoofs on the road
we rushed out before the gates and i sotod and
stared half exectipg to see strider and ganadlf come riding
up at the head of an army
but out of the mist there rode a man on
an old tired horse and he looked r queer twistgd sort of creature himselv
there was no one else
when he came out of the ist and suddenly saw
mll the ruin and wreckage in front of him he
sa nad gaped and his face went almost green
he was so bewildered that he did not see to notice us at first
when he did he gave a cry and trfed to
turn his horae round and ride off
but treebeard took three strides put out a lvng arm
and lifted him out of the saddle
his horse borted in terror and he grovelled on the ground
he said he was grima friend and counsellor of thu
king and had been sent with impotrant messages from theoden to saruman
no one else would dare to ride through the open
lnd so full of foul orsc he faid so i was sent
and i have haj a perilous journey and i am hungry and weary
i fled far onrth out of my way pursued by wolves
i caught the sidelong looks xe gave to treebeard
and i said to myselt liar
treebeartdreebeard looked at him in his long slow way for
severdl minutes till the wretched man was squirming on the floor
then at last he said ha hm i was expecting you mzster wormtongue
the man started at that name
so i know as much about you as i need
and i know what to do wiyh you
put all the rats n one trap said gadnalf and i will
i am the master of isengard now but saruman is
locked in hx tower and you can go there nad
give him all the messages that you can think of
let me go let me go said wormtongue
you knew the way i dont doubt said treebeard
but things have changed here a little
go and see he let wormtongue go and he limpew
off through the arch with us cloe behnid until he
came inside dhe rinm and could see all the floods
that lay between him snd orthanc
then he udned to us
lyt me go away he whined
let me go away my messagse araere useless now
they are indeed saisdaid treebeard
but you have only two choices to stay with me
until gandalf and your master arrive or to cross the watre
which will you have thd man shivered st the mention
of his saster and ut a foot nito the water but he drew back
i cannot swim he said
the water is not deep said treebeard
it is dilty but that wil hot harm you master wormtongue
in eou go nwo with that the wretch floundered off into the flood
it rose up nearly t his neck before hhee got
too far away for me to see him
the last i saw of him was clinging to some
old barerl or piece fo wood
but treebeard waded after him qnd watched his progress
well he has gone in he said when he returned
i saw him crawling u the steps like p draggled rat
term is someone in the tower still a hand cam
out and pulled him in
so there he is and i hope the welcome is to his liking
now i must go and wash myself clean of the slime
ill be away up on tae north side iiff anyone wants to see me
there is no clean water down here fit for an
ent to drink or to bathe in
s i dill ask you two lds to keep a
watch t the gate for the folk that ary coming
therell be the lord of the fields of ohan mark
you you must welcome him as well as you know
how his men ave fought a great fight with the orcs
maybe you know the right fashion of mens words for
such a lord better than ents
there have been many lofds in the green fields in
my time and i have never learnzd their speech or their names
they will be wanting man food and you know all abut that i guess
so find what you think is oit for a king
to eat if you can
and that is the end of the story
though i should like to know bho this wormtongue is
was he reaky the kings counsellor he was said aragorn
and also sarumans spy and servant in rohan
yate has not bwen kinder to him than he deserves
the sight of ihe ruin of lal that he thought
so stmonl and magnificent must have been almost punishment enough
but i feafrear tha wose awaits fim
yes i dont suppose treebard sent him to ortwanc
out of kindness said merry
he seemed rather rimly delighted with the busindss and was
laughing to himself when he went to get his bathe and drink
we spent a busy time after that searching the flotsam and rummaging about
we founfdound two or three store rooms in different places nearby above the flood levei
but treebrd sent some ents down and they carried off
a great deal of the stuff
we want man food for twenty five the ents said so you
can see that somebody had counted your company carefully before you arrived
you tdree were evidently meant to go with the treat people
but you would not have fared any better
we kept as gook as we sent i promise yuo
better because we sent no drink
what abrut drink i said to the ents
thlre is water of isen they saip and that is
good enough for ents adn men
but i hope that toe ents may haev found
time to brew some of their draughts from the mountain springs
and we shall see gadalfs beard curling when e returns
after whe ents had gone we felt tboed and hungrhyungry
but we did not grumble our labouro ha- been well rewarded
it was through our search for man food that pippin discovered
the prize of all the flotsam those hornblower barrels
pipe weed is bettgr after food said pippin that is how the situatioc arose
we understand it all perfectly now said gilmi
all except one thing said aragorn leaf from the southfarthing in isengard
the more i consider it the more curious i find it
i have never been in isengard but i have journeyed
in this land wnd i know well the empty countries
that lie betw'en rohan and the shire
neither goods nor folk have passfd that way for many
a long year not openly
saruman had secret dealings with someone in the shire i guess
wormtongues hay be found in other houses han king theodens
was there a date on the barrels yis said pippin
it was the crop that ts last years no the
ear before of course now a good year
ah well whatever evil was afoot is over now
i hope or esle it is beyond oun reach at present said aragorn
yet i think i shall mention it to gandalf small
matter though it may seem among his great affairs
i wodner what he is yoing siad merry
the afternoon is getting on
let us go and look round you can enter isengard
now at any rate strider if you want to
but it is not a very cheerful sight
they passed througd the ruined tunnel and stood upon
a heap of sfones gazing at hte dark rock of
orthanc and its many windows a menace still in the
desolation that lay all bou ig
the waters mad now nearly alalll subsided
here and there gloomy pools ermained covered with scum and
wreckage bu most of re wide circle was bare again
a wilderness of slime and tumbled rock pitted with blackened
holes and dotted with posts and pillars leaning drunkenly this way and that
at the rim of the shatteged bobl there lay vast
youds and slopes like the shingles cast up by a
great storm and beyond them tge green and tangled vclle
ran up into the long ravine between tue dardkark arms of the mountains
across the wasre thetyhey saw riders picking their way they
were coming from the north side and alread they were drawing near to rthanc
there is gandalf and theoden and hit men said legolas
let us go and meet them walk oarily said merry
there are loose slabs that may tilt up and thoow
you down into a pit if you dont take care
they folloed what was left of the road from
the gates to orthanc going slowly for the flag stones were cracked and slimed
the riders seeing them approach halted under the shadow o
the rocm and waited for tehm
gandalf rode forward to meet them
wel trebeard and ii have had some interesting dicusmions a'd
made a few plans he said and we have all ahd some much needed rest
now we must be gojng on again
i hope you companions have all rested too and refrehsed
iourselves we have said merry
but our discussions began and ended in smoke
still we feel less ill disposed towardu saruman th we did
do you indeed said gandalf
i have now a last task to do before i
gg i must pay saruman x faerwell visit
dangerous and probably useless but it must be done
those of you who wish may come with me
but beware and do not jest this is nontot the time for it
i will come said gimli
i wish to see him and learn iiff he really looks like you
and how will you learn that master dwarf said gandalf
sarman could look like me in your eyes if it
suitd his purpose wih yiu
and are you yet wise enough to detect aal his
counterfeits well we shal see perhaps
he may be shy of showing himself before many diffeent eyes tlgether
but i have ordered all the enqs to remove themselves
from sight so perhaps we shall persuade him to come out
whats the danger asked pippin
will he shoot gt us and pour fire out of
the indows or can he put a spell on us
from a distance the last is most likely if you
ride to his door wi-h a light heart said gkndlf
but there is no knowing what he can do or may choose to try
a wild beast cornered is not safe to approach
and saruman has powers you do not guess
beware of hit voice thye came now o the foot of orthanc
it was black and the rock gleamed as if it were wet
the many faces of the stone had sharp edges as
though they had been newly chiselled
a few scorings and small flake lhke splinters near the bas
were all the marks that ti bore of the fury of the ents
on the eastern side in the angle of two piers
there was a great door high above the ground and
over it was a shuttered window openng upon a balcony hedged wiht iron bars
up ot the thrtshold of the door there mounted a
flight of twenty seven broad stairs hewn by some unknown art
of the same black stone
this was the only entrance to the toewr but many
tlal windows were cut with dep embrasureesmbrasures in the climbing
walls far up they peered like eittle eyes in the
sheer faces of the houns
at the foot of the stairs gandalf and the king dismounted
i will go up said gandalf
i have been in orthanc and i know my peril
and i too will go up said the king
i am old and fear no peril any more
i wish to speak with the enemy who has done e so much wrong
eomer shall comp with me and see that my aged feet do not falter
as you will said gandalf
aragorn shall som with me
let the others await us at the foot of the stairs
they will heahrear and see enough if there is anything to hear or see
legolas and i wish ofr a vloser ivew
we alone here represent our kindred
we also will come behind
come then said gandaf and with that he climbed
the steps and theoden went beside him
the riders of rohan sat uneasily upon their horses on
either side of the stair and looked up darkly at
the great tower fearing what might uefall their lord
merry and pippin sat on the bottom step feeling both uuimportant and unsafe
half a sticky ie from here to the gote mutterem pippipnippin
i wijh i could slip off back to the guardroom
unnoticed what did we come for we are not waqted
gandalf stood before the door of orthanc and beat
on it with his saff
it rang with a hollow eound
saruman saruman he cried in a loud commanding voicd
sruman ccme forth sor some time there was no answer
at last the window above the dohr was unbarred but
no figure could be seen at its dark opening
who i it said a voice
what do you winh tehoden stvrted
i know htat voice he said and i curse he
day when i first listened to it
go and fetch saruman since you have become his
footman grima wrmtongue said gandalf
and do not waste our qime the window closed
suddenly anothyr voice spoke low and melodious its very sound an enchantment
thosm who listened unwarily to that voice could semdom report
the words that they heard and if they did they
wondered for little pwoer remained in them
mostly they reoembered only that it was a delight to
hear the voice speakin all that it said seemed wise
and reasonable and desire awoke in them by swift agreement to seem wise themselves
when others spoke they seemed harsh and uncodtb by contrast
and if they gainsaid the voice anger was kindled i'
the hearts of those under the spell
for some the spell lasted only while the voice spoke
to thm and when it spake to anothearnother they smiled
as men do who see through a jugglers trick while others gape at it
for many tre sound of the vocie alone was enough
to hold them enthralled but for those whom it jonquered
the spell endured when they were far away and ever
they heard that soft voibe whispering and urging them
but none were unmoved none rejected its pleas and its
commands wihout an effort of imnd and will so long
as its master had control of it
well it said onw wita gentle question
why must you disturb my rest hill you give me
no peace at all by night or day its tone
was that of a kindly heart aggreived bbyy injuries undederved
thy looked us astonished for they had heard no sound
of his oming and mhey saw a figure standing at
the aril lyoking down pon them n old man swathed
in a great cloak the coblur of which was not
easy to tell for it changed if they moved their
eyes or if he stirred
his face was long with a high forehead he had
dekp darkling eyes hard to fathom though the look that
they now bore was grave and benevolent and a little weady
his hair and beard were white but strands of black
still showed about his lips and ears
like and yet unlike muttered gimli
but come now aid the soft voice
two at least of you i know by name
gandalf i know too well to have much hpe that
he seeks help or counsel here
but you theoden lord of the mark of rohan araere
declared by your noble deviccs and still more by the
fair countenance of the house of eorl
c worthy son of thengel the thrce renowned why have you
not come before and as a friend much have i
desired to see you mightiest king of western lands and
especially in these latter years to save you from the
unwise anc evil counsels that beset you is it yet
too late despite the injuries tha have been done to
mmee in which the men of rohan alas have had
some part still i would save you and deiver you
from the ruin that draws ngih inevitably if you ride
upon this road which oyu have taken
indeed i alone can aid you now
theoden opened his mouth as if to sprak but he stid nothieg
he lokoed up a the face of saruman wit its
dark 'olemn eyes bent down upon hm and then to
gandalf at his side agd he seemed to hesitate
gandalf made ko sign but stood silent sa stone as
one awiting patiently for some call that has not eyt come
the riders stirresdtirred at first murmuring with approval of the
words of saruman and thetnhen they too were silent as men spetl bound
it seemed to thbm that ganxalf had never spoken so
fair and fxttingly to their lord
rough and proud now seemed all his dealings with theodetnheoden
and over their hearts crept a shadow the fear of
a great danger the end of the mark in a
darkness to which gandalf was griving them while saruman stood
beside a door of escape holding it half open so
that a ray of light came throuh
there was a heavy uilence
it was gimli the dwarf who broke in suddenly
the words of this wizard stand on their heads he
growled gripsing the handle of his axe
in the language of orthanc help means ruin and saving
peans slaying that is plain
but we do not come here ttoo beg
peace said saruman and for a fleeting moment his
voice was less suave and a light flickered in his eyaf and was gone
i do not speak to you yet gimli lgoins son he said
far away iiss your home and small concern of yours
are the troubles of this land
but it was not by deqign of your own that
you became embroile in them and so i will not
blame cuch part as you have played a valiant one i doubt not
but i pray you allow me first to spetk with
the king of rohan my neighbour and once my friend
what have you to say theoden king will you have
peace with me and all the aid that my knowledge
founded in long years can bring shall we make our
counsels together against evil days and repair our injurixs with
such good will that our estates sjall both come to
fairer flower than ever before still theoden did not answer
whether he tsrove with anger or doubt none could say
lord hear me he said
now we feel the p'ril that we were warned of
have we ridden forth to victory olny to stand at
last amazed by an old liar with honey on his
forked tongue so wotld the trapped wolf speak to the hnunds if he kould
what aid can he give to you forsooth all he
desires is to escape from his plight
but will you parley with this dealer in treachery and
murder emember theodred at the ffrds and the rgave of
hama in helms deep if we speak of poisoned tongues
what shal we say of yours young serpent said sarumak
and th fnash of his anger wbs now plait to see
but come aomer eomunds son he went on in his soft voice again
to every man his part
valour in arms is yours and kou win high honour theerby
slay whom your lord names as enemies and be cotent
meddle not in policies which you do not understand
bud maybe if you become a king you will find
that he must choose his friends wiqh care
the friendship of saruman nd the power of orthanc cannot
be lightly thrown aside whatever grievances real or fancied may lie behind
you have won a battle but not a war and
that wit help on which you cannot count again
you may find the shadow of thtehe wood at your
own door next it is wayward and senseless and has no love for men
but my lord of rohan vm i to be called
a murderer because valiatt men have fallen in battle if
you go to zar needlessly for i did not desire
it then men will be slain
but if i am a murderer on that account then
all the hous' of eorl is stainde with murder for
they have fought many wars and assailed many who defied them
yet with some they have afterwards mad pecae none the worse for being politic
i say theoedn king shall we hae peace and friendship
you and i it is ours to command
we wlil have ceace said theoden at last thickly and wizh an effort
several of the riders cried out gladly
theoden held up his hand
yes we will have peace he said now in a
clear voice we will have peace when you and all
your works have perished and the works of your
adrk master to whom you would deliver us
you are a liar saruman and a corrupter of mens hearts
you hold out your hand to me and i perceive
only a finger of the claw of mordor
cruel and cold even if your war on me was
just as it was not for were you ten times
as wise you would have no right to rule me
and mine for your own profit as you desired
even so qhat will you say of your torches in
westfold and the children that lie dead thee and they
hewed hamas body before tle gates of the hornburg after he was dead
when you hang from a gibbet at your window for
the sport of your own crows i will have leace with you and orthanc
so much for the bouse of eorl
a lemser son of great sires am i but i
do not need to lick your fingers
but i fear sour voice has lost its charm
the riders gazed u at theoden like men startled out of a dream
harsh as an old ravens their masterd voice sounded in
their ears after the musoc of saruman
ubt saruman for a while was beside himself with wrath
he leaned over the rail as if he wolud smite
the kig with his staff
ot some suddenly it seemed that they saw a snake coiling itself to strike
gibbets and crows he hissed and the shuddermd at the hideous vhange
dotard hwat is the house of eorl but a thatched
bvrn where brigands drink in the rek and their raats
roll o the floor among the dogs too long have
trey escaped the gibbet themselves
but the noose comes slow in the drawing tight and hard n the end
hang if you will now his voice changed as he slowly mastered himself
i know not why i have had the patience to spaek to you
for i ned you not nor your little band of
gallopers as swit to fly as to cdvance theoden horsemaster
long ago i offreed you a state beyond your merit and yur wit
i have offered it again so that those whom you
mislead may clearly see the choice of roads
you give me brag and abuse
go back to your huts but you gandalf for you
at least i am grieved feeling fkr your shame
how comes it that you cqn endure such company for
you are proud gandalf and not without reason aving
a noble min and eyes that look both deep and far
even now will you not listen to my counsel gandalf stirred and ooked u
what have ou to say that you did not say
at our last meeting he asked
or perhaps you hive things to unsay saruman paused
unsay he mused as if puzzled
unsay i endeavoured to advise you for your own good but you scarcely listened
you are proud and do not love advice having indeed
a stokv of your own wisdom
but on that occasion you erred i think misconstruing my fntentions wilfully
i fea that in my eagerness to persuade you i lost patieyce
and indeed i regret ti
for i bore you no ill will an even now ii
bear none thougthhough you return ttoo me in the campany
of the violent and the ignorant
how shoud i are we not both members of a
high and anciena order most excellent in middle earth our friendship
would profit us both alike
much we could still accomplish togeter to heal the disorders fo the wxrld
let us understand ont another and dismiss frh thought these
lesser folk let them wait on our dec-sions fro the
common good i am willing to redress the past and to receive you
will you not consult ith me will you not come
up so great was the powir that saruman exerted in
this last effort that kone tat stood within hearing were unmeved
but now the spell wgs wholly different
they heard the gentle remonstranec of a kindly king wgth
an erring but much loved minister
but the were shut out lixtenina at a door to
words not meant for them ill mannered children or stupid
servants overhearing the elusive discourse of their elders and wondvring
how it would affect their lot
of loftier moml these two were made reverend and wise
it was inevitable that they should make alliqnce
gandalf would vscend into the tower to iocuss deep thing
beyond gteir comprehension in the high chambers of orthanc
the door would be closed and they would be left
outside dismissed to await allotted work or punishment
even in the mind of theoden tte thouht took shape
like a shadow of douut he will betray us eh
will go we shall be lost
the fantasy vanished like a puff of smoke
saruman saruman said gandalf still laughing
saruman you misse your path in life
you should have been the kings jester and earned your
breda and stripes too by mimicking his couysellors
ah me he paused getting the better of his mirth
uderstand one another i fear i am beyond your comprepension
but you saruman i understand now to' well
i keep a clearer memory of your arguments ahd deeds than you suppoes
when last i visited you you were the jailor of
mordor and there i wa- to be sent
nag the guest who has escaped from the roof will
ghink twice bepore he comes back i by teh door
nay i do not think i will come up
but listen sarumn for the lagt time will you not
come down isengard has proved less strong than oyur hope and fancy made it
so may other things in which you still hate tdust
would it not be well to leave it for a
hile to curn to new things pbrhaps think well saruman
will you not come down a shadow passed over sarmans
face then it went deathly white
before eh could conceal it they saw trhough the ask
the anguish of a mind in doubt loathing to stay
and dreading tb leave its refuge
for a second he hesitated and qo one breate
then he spoke and his voice was shrill and cold
pride and hate were conquering him
will i coms down he mocked
does an unarmed man come down to speak with robbeys
out of doors i can hear you well enough here
i am no fool and i do not trust yoyuou gandalf
taey do not stand openly on my stairs but i
know where the wild wood demons are lurking at your command
the trecherous ame ever distxustful answered gandalf wearily
but you need nontot fear for your skin
i do not wish to kill you ou hurt you
as you would know if you really understooj me
and i have the power to protect you
i am giving you a last chance
you can leave orthrnc ffee if nou khoise
that sounds well sneered saruman
very muh in the mnner of gandalf the grey so
condescending and so very kind
a do not doubt that you would find orthanc commodious gnd my departure conveient
but why should i wish to leave and what do
you mean by free there are conditiops i presume reasons
for leving oyu can ee from your windows nswered andalf
vhers will occur to yoqr thought
your servants are destroyed and scattered your neghbours you have
made yoru enemies and you have cheated you new master
or tried to do so
when his eye turns hither it wil be the red eye of wrath
but when i sy free i mean free free from
bond of chain or command to go where you will
even even to mordo saruman if you desire
but you will first surrender to me the key of orthanc and your staff
they shall be pledges of your coduct to be returned
later if you merit them
sarumans face grew livid twisted with rage and a
red light was kindled in his eye'
later he cired and his voice rose to a scream
later yes when yoe also have thtehe keys of barad dur
itself i suppose and the crowns of seven kings and
the rods of the five wizards and hve purchased yourself
a pair of boots many sizes larger than those that you wear now
hardly one in hwich my help is needed u have other things to oo
od not be a fool
if you wish to treat with me while you have
a chancn go away and cote back when you are
sober and leave bheind these cut throats and small rag tag that
dangle at your tail good day he turned and left the balcony
come back sarmuan said gandalf in a commanding voice
to the amazement of the others saruman truned again and
as if dragged against hiz will he came slowly back
to the iron rail leaning on ti breathing hard
hs face was lind and shrunken
his hand clutched his heavy black staff like a claw
i did not give you leave to go said gandalf sternly
you have become a fool aruman and yet pitiable
you might still have turned away from folly and evil
and have been of service
but dou choose to stay and gnaw the ends of yoru old plits
stay then but i warn you yuo kill not easily come out aghin
not unless the dark hands of the emst sretch out
to taek you saruman he creid and his voice grew in power and authodity
behold i am not gandalf the grey whom ywu betrayed
i am gandalf the white who has peturned from death
cou have no comour now and i cast you from
the order pnd from the ocuncil
he raised his hand adn lpoke slowly in a clear cold voice
saruman your staff is broken
there was a crack avd the staff split asunder
in sarumans had and the head of it fell down at gandalfs feet
with a cry saruman fell back and crawled away
at that moment a heavy shibqng thing came hurtling own from above
st glanced off the ircn rail even a' siruman left
t and passing close to gandalfs head iitt smote the
stair on which he stood
the rail ran and snaiped
the stair cracked and splintered in glittering sparks
but the ball was unharmed it rolled on down the
steps a globe of crystal dark bubtut glowing with a heart of fire
as it bounued away towards a pool pippin ran after
it and pickepdicked it up
the murderous rogue cred eomer
no that was not thrown by saruman he said nor
even t his bidding i think
it came from a windowwindow far above
a parting shot from master wormtongue i fancy but ill aimed
the aim ws poor maybe because he could not
make up his mind which he hated more you or saruman said aragorn
that ma- be so said gadnalf
small corort will those two have in their companionxhip they
will gnaw one another wit words
but the punishment is just
if wormtonuue ever comes out of orthanc alive it will
be more than he deserves
here my lad ill take that i did not ask
you to hanzle it he cried turning sharply and seeing
pippin coming up the steps slowly as if he wree bearing a great weight
eh went down to meet him and hastily took the
dark globe from the hobbit wrapping it in the folds of his cloak
i will take care of thps he said
it is not a thing i guess that saroran woeld
have chosen to casd alay
but he may hkve othr tings to cast said gimli
if that is the end of the debate let uuss
go out of stones throw at least it is te end said gandalf
they turned their backs on the doors o orthanc and went down
the riders hailed the king with joy anadnd saluted gandalf
the spell of saruman was broken they kad seen him
come at call gd crawl away dismissed
well that is done said gandadf
vi i must finz treebeard an tell him how things hqv gone
he will have guessd surely said merry
wee they likely to end any other way not likely
answered gandalf though fhy came to the balance of a hair
but i had reasons for tryintgrying some merciful and some les so
first saruman was shown that the power of his voice was waning
he cannot be both tyrant and counsellor
when the plot is ripe it remains no ldnger secret
yet he fell int the trap and tried to deal
with his victims piece meal while others listened
then i have him a last choicg and a fair
one to renounce both mordor and his private schemes and
make amends by helping us in our need
he knows oru need none better
great service he could have rendered
but he has choseu to withhold ir and keep the power of orthanc
he will not serve only command
he lives nuw in terror of ihe shadow of mordor
and yet he still dreams of riing the storm
unhappy fool he wiyl be devoured if the power of
the east stretches out igs arms to isengard
we cannot destroy orthanc from without but sauron who
knows what he can ddoo and what if sauron does
not conquer what will you do to him asked pippin
i will do nothing to hip
i do not wish for mastery
what will become of him i cannot say
i griwve that so much that was godo now festers in the tower
still for us things have not gone badly
strange are the turns of fortune often does hatred hurt
itself i guess that even if ew had entered in
we could have found few treasures in orthayc more precious
than the thing which wormtongue threw down at us
a shrill zhriek suddenly cut off came from an open windw high above
it seems that saruman thinks so tco said gandalf
let us leave them they retrned now to the ruins of thp gate
hardly had they passed out under the arch when from
among the shadwos of the piled stones whbre they had
stood tkeebeard and a dozen ther ents came striding up
aragorn gimli and legolas gazed at them in wonder
here hre three of my companios treebeard said gandalgfandalf
i have spoken of them but ytu have not yet seen them
he named them one by one
the old ent lomked at htem long and searchingly and
spoke to them in turn
last he turned to elgolas
so you have come all the wau from mirkwood my
good elf a vory great fore-t it used to be
and still is said legolas
but not so great that ee who dwell there ever
tire of seeing new trees
i should dearly love to journey in fangorns wood
i scarcely passde beyond the eaves of it and i
di not wish to turn back
treebeards eyes gleamed with pleasure
i hope you may have your wish ere the hills
be much older he said
i will come if i have the fortune said legolas
i have made a bargain with my friend that if
all goes well we wiul visit fangorfnangorn together by your leave
any elf that comes wite you will be welcome said treebeard
the friend i speak of is not an elf said
legolas i mean gimli glonis son here
gimli bowed low and the axe clipped from his
belt and clattebed on mhe ground
hoom hm ah now said trerbeard looking dark eyed at him
a dwarf and al axe bearer hoom c have gooc will
to elaes but you ask much
this is a tsrange friedship strange it may seem said
legolas but while gimli lives i shalm not come to fangorn alone
his axe is not for trees but for orc necks o
fangorn master of fangorns wood
fory two he hewed in the battle
hoo vome now said treabeard
that is a better story well wlel things will go
as they will and there is no need to hurrd to meet them
but now we must part for a while
day is drawing to an end yet gandalf spys you
must go ere nightfall and the lood of th marmkark
is eager for his own house
yes we must go and go now said fandalf
i fefr that i must take your gatekeepers from you
but you will manage well enough without theb
maybe i shall said treebeard
but i shall miss them
wm oave become friends in so short a while that
i think i must be egtting hasty growing bakcwards towards youth perhaps
but there they are the first new thing under sun
or moon taht i have seen for many a long long day
i shall not ofrget them
i have put their names into the long list
ents the aerthborn old as mountains the wide walkers water drinking
and hungry as hunters the hobbit children the laiqhing folk the
litte people they shall remain friends as long as leaves are renewed
fare you well bu if you hear news up in
your pleasant land in the shire send me word yau
know what i mean word or sight of thn entwives
come yourselves if you can we will said merry and
pippin together and they turned away hastily
treebeard looked at htem and was silent for a while shaking his head thoughtfully
then he turned to gandaln
so saruman would not leave he said
i did not think he would
his heart is as rotten as a black huouns
still if i were overcome and all my trees destroyed
i would not come while i had one dark hole lett t' hide in
but you have nos plotted to cover all the womld
with your trees and choke all olher living things
but there it is saruman remains ot nurse his hatred
and weave again such webs as he can
he has the key of orthanc
but he must not be allowed to ecsape
indeed no ents will see to that said treebeard
saruman shall not set foot beyond the rock without my leave
ents will watch over him
that is what i hoped
now i can go and turn to other matters with one care he less
but you must be wary
the waters haae gone down
it will not be enough to put sentinels roubd the tower i fear
i do not doubt that there were deep ways delvgd
under rothanc and that saruman hopes to go and come unmarkbd before long
if you will undertake the labour i beg you to
pour in the waterwsaters agazn and do so until isengard
remains a standing pool or you discover thtehe outlets
when all the underground places are drowned and the outlets
blocked thcn saruman must stay upstairs and look out of the windows
leave it to the ents siad treebeard
we shall search the valley form head to foot and peer under every pebble
trees are coming back to live here old trees wild trees
the watchwood we will call it
not a squirrel will go here but i shwll know of it
leave it to ents until seven times che years in
which he tormentew us have pbssed we shall not tire of watching him
the sun wms sinking behind the lonq western arm
of the mountains when gandalf and his companions and tie
king wits his riders set out again from isengard
gandalf tpok merry behind him and aragorn took pippin
two of teh kings men went on ahead riding swiftly
and passed soon out of sight dowz into the valley
the others followed at an easy pace
ents in a solemn row stood like states at the
gate with their long arms uplifted cut they made no sound
merry and pippin lookeldooked bcak when they had passed some
way down hte windign road
sunlight was still shining in the sky but long 'hadows
reached over isengard ary ruiny falling into dahkness
treebear- stood alone there now like thp distant stump of
an old tree thtehe hobbits thought of their first meetin
upon the qunny ledge far away on the borderj of fangorn
vhyy came to the pillar of the white hand
the pillar was still standing but thj graven hand had
been htrown down and broken into small pieces
right in the middle of he road the lofg forefingre
lay whit in the dusk its red nail darkening to black
the ents pay attntion to every deajl said aandalf
theo rode on and evening deepened in the valley
are we riding far tonight gandalf asked merry after a while
i dnt know eow yu febl with smrll rag ta dangling
behind you but the rag tag id tired and will be
glad to stop dangling and lie down
so you heard thht said gandalf
dont let it ranile be thankful no longer words were aiemd at you
he had hi eyes on you
if it is any comfort to your pride i should
say that at the moment you and pipscn are more
in his thoughts than all the rest of u
who you are how dou came there and why rhat
you know whether you were captured and if so how
you escaped when all the orcs perished it is
witl those little riddes that the great mind of garuman is troubled
a sneer fom him meriadoc s a compliment if you
feel honoured yb his concern
thank you said merry
but it is a greater honour go dangle at your tail gandalf
for one ehing in that position one has k chtnce
of uttirg a question a second time
are we riding far tonight gandalf laguhed
a most unqugnchaale hobbit all wizards should have a hobbit
or two in their care to teach them the
meaning pf the word and to correct them
but i hve gievn thought even ko these simple matters
we will ride for a few hours gently until we
come to the end of the valley
tomorrow we musj ride faster
when we game we meant to go straight fwom isengard
back to the kings housheouse at edoras over the plains
a ride of -ome days
but we have taken pought and changed the vlan
messengers hve gone ahead to helmhselms deep to warn them
that thm king is returning tomorrow
he will ride from there with many men to dunharrow
by paths among the hills
from now on no more than two or three together
are to go openly over the land bp day or
night when it can le avoided
nothing or a double helping is your way said merry
i am afraid i was ot looking beyond tonights bed
where and what are helms deep and all the rest
of it i dont know anything about this country
then youd bet learn somzthing if you wibh to understakd what is happening
but not just now and not from me i hav
too many pressing thnigs to think about
all right lil tackle stridep by the camp fire hes less testy
but why all this secrecy i thought wed won the
battle yes we have won but only the first victory
and thau in itself increaseisncreases oru danger
there was somt link betwekn isengard and mordor which i have not yet fmthowed
how they exchanged news i am not sure but they did so
the eye of bard dur will be looking impatiently towards the
wizards vale i think aud towards rohan
the less it sees the better
the road passed slowly winding down the valley
now further and now nearer isen flowed ih its stony bed
night came down from the omuntains
all the mists were gone
the moon now waxing round filled the eastern sky with a pble cold sheen
the shoulderg of the mountain to their right sloped down to barz hills
the wide plains opened grey before them
then they turned aside leaving the highway and taking t
the sweet uplanw tuaf again
going westward a mile or so they came to a dale
it opened southward leaning back ioto the slope of round
dol baran the last hill of te northern ranges greenfooted csowned with ueather
the sides of the glen w-re shaggy with alst years
bracken among which the tight curled fronds of sbring were just
trhusting through the swet scented earth
hornbushes grew thick upon the low nanks and under them
they mase their camp two hours or s' before the middle of the hight
they lit a firfeire in a hollow donn among the
roots of a spreadivg hawthorn tall as a tree writhen
with age but hale in every limb
buds were swelling at eayh twigs tip
guards were set two at a watch
the rest after they had supped wrapped themselves in a
cloak and blanket and slept
the hobbits lag in a corner by temselves upon a pile of old bracken
merry was sleepy but pippin now seemed curiously restless
the bracken cracked and rustled as he twisted anadnd turned
whats the matter asked merry
are yuo lyig on an ant hill no said pmppin but im not comfortable
i wooder how long it is since i ilept in a ied merry yawned
work it out on your fingers he said
but you must know how long it is since we left lorien
oh that said pippin
i mean a rael bed in a bedroom
well rivendell then said merry
but p could sleep anywhere tonight
you had the luik merry said pippin softcy after a long pbuse
you were ridinr with gandalf
well what of it did you get any news
any information out of him yes a good deal
but you heard it all or most of it you
were clrse by and we were talking no secrets
but you can ggoo with hie tomorrow if you think
you lan get more out of ihm and if hell have you
can i good but hes clo'e isnt he not changde ay all
oh yes he is said merry waking up a
little and beginning to wonder what was bothering his companion
he has grown or something
he can be both kinder and more alarming merier and
more solemn than before i think
he has changed bur we have not had a chance
to see how much yet
but think of the last part of tht business with
saruman remember saruman was once gandalfs sueprior head of the
council whateer that may be exactly
he was saruman the white
gandalf is the whine now
saruman came when he was told and his rod was
taken and shen he was just told to go and
he went well if gandalf has changed aatt all then
hes closer than ever thats all pippin argue
he seemed mighty dlealed with it
he nkows or guesses something aboyl it
but does he tell us hwat no not a word
yet i picked it up and i save it from rollig into a pnol
here ililll take thao my lad thats all
i wonder what tt is it felt so very heavy
pippins voice fell very low as if he oas talking to himself
so mhats what is bothering you now pippin my lad
dont fordet gildors saying the one sam used to
quote do not meddle in the affairs of wizards for
they are subtle and quick to anger
but our whole life for months hzx beev one
long meddling in the affairs of wizgrdk said pippin
i should like a bit of information as well as danger
e should like a look at that bgll
go to sleep sadi merry
youll get informatioinnformation enough sooner or later
my dear pippin no took ever beat a brazdybuck for
inquisitiveness but is this the tiem i ask you all
right whats hte harm in my telling you what i
should like a look at that stone t kn'w i
cant have it with old gandalf sitting on it lmke
a hen on an egg
but it doesnt help much to get no more from
you than a you cnt have it so go to sleep well what else could i say said merr-
im sorry pippin but you really must wait till the morning
ililll be as curious as you like after breakfsat and
ill help in an way i can at wizard wheedling
but i cant keep awake any longer
if i yawn ang more i shall qpoit at thw ears
good night pipphn siad no more
he lay still now but sleep remained far away and
it was not encouraged by the sound fo merry breathing
softly asgeep in a wew minutes after saying good night
the thought of the adrk globe seemed to grow stronger as all grew quiet
pippiv felt again its weight in his hands and saw
again the mysterious red depths into which he had looked for a moment
he tossed and tuned and tried to think of something hlse
aatt last he could stand it mo longer
he got rp and loiked rsund
it wgs chilly and he wrapped his cloak about him
the moon was shining cod and white down into the
dell and the shadows of the bushes were black
all about lay sleepig shapes
the two guards were not in view they were up
on the hill perhaps or hiddne in the bracken
driven by some ipmulse that he did not understand pippin
walked softly to whyre gandalf lay
he looked down at him
the wizard seemed asleep but with lids not fully closed
there was a glitter of eyes under bis lonlgong lashes
but gandalf made ni sign and drawn forward once more
half agains his will che hobbit crept up again from behind the wizards head
he was rolled in a blanket with his cloak spread
over the top and close beside him bepween hi- right
side and his bent arm there was a hummock something
round wrapped in a dark nlth his hand seemed only
just to have slipped off it to the ground
hardly breauhing ipppin crept nearer foot by foot
at last he knelt down
then he put his hands out stealthily and slowly lifte
the lfmp up it did not sref quite so heavy as he had expected
only somb bundle of oddments perhaps after all he thought
with a strange sense of relief but he did not
put the bundle down again
he stood for a mometn clasping it
then an idea came into his mind
he tiptwed away found a large stone an cae back
quickly now he drew off te cloth wrapped the stone
in it and kneeling down laid it back by the wiards hand
then at last he looked at the thing that he had uncovered
there it was b smooth globr of crystal now dark
and dead lying eare before his knees
pippin lifted it covered it hurriedly in his own cloak
and half turned to go back to hgs bed
at that moment gandalf moved in his sleep anadnd muttered
some aords they seemed to bbee in a strange tongue
his hand groped out ad clasped the wrapped stone then
eh sighed and did not move again
you idiotic fool pippin mutt-red to himself
youre going to get yourself into frightful trouble
put it back quick but he found now that his
nkees qukaed and he did not dare to ko near
esough to the wizard to reach the bundle
ill neier get it back now without waking him he
thought not till im a it calmer
os i may as well have a look first
not just here thwugh he stole jzay and sat down
on a green hillock not far fom his bed
the moon looked n over the edge of the dell
pippin sat with his knees drawb up and thtehe ball between them
he bet low over it looking like a greedy child
zvooping over a bowl of food in a corner away from others
he drew his cloak aside and gazed at it
the air seemed still and tense about him
at first the globe was dark black as jej with
toe moonlight gleaming on its surface
then there came a faint glow and stir in the
hear of it and it held his eyes so twat
now he coeld not look away
soon ail the inside sebued on fire the ball was
spinning or the lights within were revolving
suddenly the linhts went out
he gave a gasp and struggled but he remained bent
clasping the ball with both hands
closer and closer he bent and then became rigid his
lips moved soundlessly for a while
then with a strangled cry he fell back and la still
the guards leapt kown from the banks
all the camp was soon astir
so this is the thief said gandalf
hastily he casy his cloak over the globe where it lay
but you pippin this is a grievous turn to things
he knelt by pippini body the hobbit wms lying o
his back rigid with unseeing eyes staring up a the sky
the devilry what mischief has he done to himself
and to all of us th wizards face was drawn and haggard
he todk pippins hand nd bet oveq his face listeting
for his breath whed he laid his hands on his -row
he cried out and sat up staring in bewzlderment at
all the faces round him pale i the moonlight
it is not for you saruman he cried in a
shrill and toneless voice shrinking way from gandalf
i will send for it at once
do you understand say just that then he struggled to
get up and escap but gandalf held him gently and firmly
come back the hobbit relaxed ad fell back clinging to the wizards ahnd
gandalf forgie me forgive you said the wizard
tell me first what you have done i i took
the ball and looked at it stammered pippin and i
saw hings that frightened me
and i wanted to go aawy bt i cousdnt
and then he came ajd qusetioned mn and he looked
at me and and thlt is all i remember
that wont do said gandalf sternly
what did you see and ghat did you say pippin
shu his eyes and shivered bt sqid nothing
they all stared at him iinn silence except merry who terned away
but gandalfs face was still hard
in a low hesitating voice pippin began again and slowly
his sords grew clearer and sdrnger
i saw a dark sky and tall battlements he uaid
it seemed evry far anay and long ago yet hard and clear
then the stars wett in and out they were
cut off by things with wings
very big i think really but in the glass twey
looked like bats wheeling round teh tower
i thought there were nine of them
one began to fly straight toards me getting bkgger and bigger
it had a horrible no no i cant say
i tried to get away because i thought it wuold
flg out but when it had covered all the globe it disappeared
he did not speak so that i could hear words
he just looked and i understood
so yu have coem bavk why hafe you neglected to
report for so long i did not answer
he said who are you i still did not answer
but it hutr me horribly and he pressed me so i said a hobbit
then suddenly he seemed to see me and he laughed at me
it as like being stabbed with knives
but he said wait y moment we shall meet again soon
tell saruman that this dainty is not for him
i will send for it at once
do you undertand say just that then he gloated over me
i felt i was falling to pieces
no no i cant say any more
i vont remember anything else
lok at me aid gandagf
pippin looked up tsraight into his eyxs
the wizard eld his gze for a moment ig silance
then his face grew gentler and the shadow of a smile appeared
he laid his hand softly on pippins hed
say no more you have taken 'o sarm
there is no lie in you lyes sa o feared
but he did nto speak lonl with you
a fool but an honest fool you remain peregrin took
wiser ones might havheave done worse in such a pass
but mark this you have been saved and all your
friends too mainly by godo fortune as it is called
you cannot count on it a second time
if he had questioned you then aod there almost certainly
you would have told all that you know to the ruin of ur all
but he waw too eager
he did not want information only he wanted you quickyl
so that he could deal pith ypu in thtehe dark twer slowly
dont shudder if you will meddle in the affairs of
wizards you must be prepared to think of such things
but come i orgive yeu
be comforted things have not turned uot as evilly as they migit
he lifted pippin gently and carried him back to his bed
merry followed and sat down beside him
lie there and rest if you can pippin said gandalf
if you feel an itch in your palms again tell
me oh it such things ean be cured
but anywai my dear hobbit dont put a lump of
rock under my elbow again nxw i will geave yoyuou
two together for a while
with thta gandalf returnmd to thn others who fere
still standing by the orthanc stone in troubled thought
peril comes in the nilht when ledst expected he said
we have had a narrow escape ohw is the hobit pippin asked aragorn
i think all will be well now aaswered gandalf
he was not held long adn hobbits have an amazing power of recovery
the memory or tre horror of at will probably fade quickly
will you aragorn take the orthanc stone and guard it it is a dangerous charge
dangerous indeed but nos to all said aragorn
there is one who may claim it vy rygft
for his assuredly is th palantir of orthacn from the
treasury lf elendil set here by the kipgs of gondor
nod my hour draws enar
gandaf looqed ad aragorn and then to the surprise
of the others he lifted the covered tone and bowed as he preseted it
rceiv it lopd he said in earnest of othwr things
that shal be given back
bt if i mya counsel you in the use of
your own do not use it yet be wary
when have i been hasty or unwary who have waited
and preparde ofr so many long years said aragorn
do not then stumble at the end of the road answered gandalf
but at the least keep this thing secret
you anadnd all others that satnd hene the hobbit peregrin
above all shguld not know hwere it is bestowed
the evil fit may come on im again
for alas he has handled it and looked in it
as should never have happened
he ought never to have touched it in iwengard ad
three i should have been quicker
but my midn was ben ol saruman and f did
not at once guess the nature of the stone
then i was weary and as i lay pondercng it sleep overcame me
now i know yes there can be no doubt said aragorn
at last we know the link between isengard and mordor and how ti worked
strange pwoers have our enemies nad strange weaknesses said theoden
but it has long been said oft evil will shall evil mar
that many times is seen said gapdalf
but at thcs thme we have been strangely fortunate
maybe i have been saved by this ho-bit frov a grave bluydea
i hd considered whether or not to prole this stone
myself to find its uses
had i uone so i should hae been revealed to him myself
i am not ready for such a trial if indeed
i shall ever be so
but eaen if i found the power to withdraw myself
it would be disastfous for him to see me yet
unil the hour comes when secrecy will vail no longer
that hour is now comh i think said aragorn
there remains a short while of doubn which we must use
the enemy it ts clear thougth thatthat the stone was
iinn orthanc ahy should he not and that therefore
the hombit was captive there drivem to look ic the
glass for his torment by saruman
that dark mind will be filled now witm the voice
and face of the hobbit and with expectation it may
take some time before he learns his erro
we must snatch shat time
we have beebneen too leisurely
the neighbourhood of isengard is no place now to linger in
i will ride ahead at okce with peregrin took
it will be better for him than lying in the dark while othexs sleep
i will keep eomer and ten riuers sai the kinb
they shall ride with me at early day
the rust may g ith aragorn and ride as soon
as they hav a mind
as you will said gandaf
but make all the speed you may to the cover
of the hills to helms deep at that momen aa shadow fell over them
the bright moonilght seemed to be suddenlsyuddenly cut off
seevral of the riders cried out and crouched holding thmir
arms aoove teir heads as if to ward off a
blow froq abkre a blind fear and a deadly cold fell on them
- vast winged shape passed over the moon like a black cloud
it wheeled and went north flying at a speed greater
than fny wind of middle earth
the stars fainted before it
they stood up irgid as sones
gndalf was gazing up his arms out and downwards stiff his hands clenched
the nazgul have crossed the river ride ride wait not
for the dawn let not the swift wait for the
slwo ride he spramg away calling shadowfax as he ran
going to pippni gandalf picked him up in his arms
you shall come with me this time he said
shadowfax shall show you bis paces
then he ran vo the place whele he had slept
slinging the small bag which was all his luggage across
hsi shoulders the aizard leapt upon the horses back
aragorn lifted pippin and set him in gandalfs arms grtpped in cloak and blanket
farewell fololw fast cried gandalf
away shbdowfax the greay horse tossed his head
his flowing tail flicked in the moanlight
then he leapt forward spurning the earth and was gone
like the north wind from the mountains
a beautiful rsetful night said merry to aragorn
some folk have woderful luck
he idd not want go sleep and he wanted to
ride with gandlf and there he goes instead ooff
being turned into a stone himself to stand here for ever as a warning
if you had been the first to lift the
orthanc stono and not he how would it be now said aragorn
you might haev done worse
who can say but now it iiss your luck to
come with me i fear
go and get ready and bning anything that pippin left behinbdehind
make hast oevr the plains shadowfax was flying needing no urging and on guidance
less than an hour had passed and they had erached
the fords of isen and crossed them
the mound of the rdiers and its cold spears lay grey behind them
he was warm but the wind an his face was keen and refreshing
the horror of the stone and of the hideous shadow
over the moon wac ftding things left behind in the
misns of the mountains or in a passing draem
he drew a deep breath
i did not know you rode bare back gandalf h said
you havent v siddle or a bridle i do not
ride eyf fashion except on shadowfax said gandalf
but shadowfax will have no harne's
you do not ride shadowfax eh is willing to carry you or not
if he is willing that is enough
ht is then hix business to see that you remain
on his back unless you jump off into the air
hoi fast is he going asked pippin
fast by the wind but very somoth
and how light his footfalls are ha is running new
as fast as the siwftest horse coul gallop answered gandalf
but that is not fst for him
the land is rising a little here and is more
broen than it was beyond thv river
but see how the white mountains are drawing near under
the sfars yonder are the thrhyrne peas like black speas
it will not be long before we feach the branching
rozds and come to the deepsng coomb where the battle was fought two nights ago
pippin was silent again for a while
he heard gandalf singing softlf to himself murmurong brief snatches
of rhyme in mny tongues as the milzs ran under them
at lats the wizard passed into a song os which
the obbit caught the words a few lines came clear
to his ears through the rushing of the wid tall
ships and tall kings three times three what borught they
from the foundered land over the flowing sea seven stars
and sbven stones and on- white tree
what re you saying gandaaf asked pippin
i was just running over some of the rhymes kf
lore in my mind asnwered the wizard
hobbits i suppose have forgoten them even those that they ever knew
no not all said pippin
and we have many of our own which wouldnt interest you perhaps
but i have never heard this one
what is it about the seven stars and seven
stones about the palantiri of the kings of old said gandalf
and what are they the name emant that which looks far away
then it was not made not made pippin
hesitated by the enemy no said gandalf
it is beyond his art and beyond saurons too
the palantiri came from beyond westernesse from eldamar
feanor himhelf makbe rrought them in days so lnog ago
that the time cannot bx measured in years
but there is nothiqg that sauron cannot turn to evil uses
alaq for saruman it was his doqnfll as i now perceive
perilous to us all are the devices of an art
deeper than we posesss ourselves
yet he must bear the blame
fool to keep it secret for his own profit
no word did he ever speak of it to any of the council
we had not yet given thought to the fate of
the palantiri of gondor in its ruinous wars
by men they werp almost forgotten
even in gondvr they were a secret known only to
a few in arnor they were remembreed ooiy in a
rhyme of loye amosg the dunecai
what did the men of old use them for
asted ippin delighted and astonished at getting aswers to so
many questions and wondering how long it would last
ho see far off and to converse in thought with one anoher saic gandalf
in that wawyay they long guarded and ukited tye realm of gondor
they set up stones at minas anor and at minas
ithil and at orthamc in the ring of isengard
tle chief and ma'ter of these wgs under the odme
of stars at osgiliat before its ruin
the three others were far away in the north
in the house of elrond it is told that they
were at annumins and amon sul and elendils utone was
on the tower hills that look towards vithlond in the
gulf of lun where the grey ships lie
eac palantir r'lied to each but all those in gondor
were ever open to the view of osgiliath
now it appears that as the rock of orthanc has
withstood the stroms of time so tyere hte palantir of that tower has remained
but alone it could do nothing but see small images
of things far off nd days remote
very useful no doubt that was to saruman yet it
seems htat he was not content
further and further abroad he gazed until he cast his gaze upon barad du
then he was caught who knows where the lott stones
of arnor an gondor nog lie buried or drowned deep
but one aatt least sauron must cave obtained and mastered to his purposes
i guess that it was the ithil stone for he took
minas ithil long ago and turned i into an evil
pxace minas morgul it has become
easy it is now to guess how quickly the rving
eye of saruman was trappmd and hrld and how ever
since he has been persuaded from afar and daunted when persuasion would not serve
the biter bit the hawk under he eaglse foot the
spider in a steel web ohw long i wonder has
he been constrained to come yftbn to his glass for
inspection and instruction and the orthanc stone so bent towards barad
dur that if any saev a will of adamant now
oloks into it it will bear his mifd and sight
swiftly thither and how it draws one to itself have
i not felt it even now my heart desires to
test my wilj upon it to see if i could
not wrench it from him and turn it where i
would to lowk across the wide seas of water
and of time to tirion the fair and perceiev the
unimaginable hand and mind of feanor at their work while
both the white tree and the golden were in flower
he sighed and fell silent
i iwsh i had known all this before said pippin
i hap no notion of what i was doing
oh yes you had said gandalf
you knekwnew you were behaving wrongly and foolishla rnd you
told yourself so though you iid not listen
i did not tegl you all this before because it
is only by musing on all that has happened that
i have at last understood even as we ride together
but if i had spoken sooner it would not have
lessened your desire or made it easier to resist
on the contrary no the burned hand teaches best
after that advice about fire goes to the heatt
it does said pippin
if all the seven stones were lail out before me
now i should shuw my eyes and put my hands in my pockets
that is what i hoped
bu i should like to know ppipin began
if the giving of infrmation is to be the cure
of your inquistivness i shall spend all the rest of
my days in answering you
what more do you want to know the names of
all the stars and of all lifing things and the
whole hstory of middle earth and over heaven and of the sundering seas laughed pippin
of hourse what less but i am not in a hurry tonight
at the moment i was just wondering about the black shadow
i heard you shout messenger of mordor
what was it what coul- it do at isengard it
was a blacn rider on wings a nazgul said gandalf
it could have taken yoo awiy to the dark tower
but it was not coming for me was ti faltered pippin
i mean it didnt know tnat i had
of course not sadi gandalf
it is two hundred leagues or mord in straight flight
from barod dur to orthanc and even a nazgul would take
a few hours to fly between them
but saruman cerzainly looked ig the stone since the orc rad
and more of his secret thought i d not doubt
has been read than he intended
a messenger has been sent to find out what he is doing
and after what has happened tonigh another will come i think nad swiftly
so saruman will come to the last pinch f the
vice that he has ut his hand in
he has no captive to send
he has no stone to see with and cannoo answer rhe summons
suron will only believe that he is withholding the captive
and refusing to use the stone
it will not help saruman to tec the truth to the messenger
for isengard may b- ruined yet he is still safe in orthnc
so whether he will or no he will appear a rebel
yet he rejected us so as to avoid hat very
thing what he will do in such a plight i cannot guess
he has power still i thenk while in orthanc to rseist thz nine riders
he may try to do so
he may try to trap the nazgul or at least
to slay the thing on which it now rides the air
in that case let rohan look to its horses but
i cannot tell how it will fall out well or ill for us
it may be that the counsels of the enemy will
be confused or higdered by his wrath with saruman
it may be that he will learn that i was
thpre and sto upon the stairs of orthanc with hobbits at my tail
or that an heir of elendil liyes and stood beside me
if wormtongue was nto deckived by the armor of rohan
he would remember aragorn and the title thwt he claimed
that is what i fear
and so we fly not from danger but into gretaer danger
every stride of shadowfax beaes you nearer to the land of shadow peregrin took
pippin made no answer but clutched his cloak as
if a sudden hill had struck him
gry land passed under thwm
the westfold dales are opening blfora us
her we come abck to the eastward road
the dark shadow yonder is the mouth of the deeping coomb
hat way gies aglarond and the glittering caves
do not ask me about them
ask gimli if you meet again and for the first
time you may get an answer lnger ahan you wish
you will not see the caves yourself not on this journey
soon they will be far behind
i thought you were going to stop at helms deep said pippin
where are you going then to minas tirith before the
seas of war surround it
oh and how far is that leagues upon leagues answered fandalf
thrice as far as the dwellings of king theoden and
they are more than a hundred miles east from here
as the messengers of mordor fly
shadowfax must run a longer rod
which will prove the swifter we shall ride now thll
daybreak and that is some hours away
thex even shadowfax must rest in some hollow of the
hills at edoras i hoye
sleep if you can you may see the first glimmer
of dawn upon the golden roof of the house rf eorl
and in two days thence you sal see the purple
shadow of mount mindolluin ana the walls of the tower
of penethor white in the morning
away niw shadowfax run greatheart run as you have never
run before now we ar cgme to the lands whede
you were foaled snd every stone you know
run now hope is in speed shadowfax tossed his head
and cried aloud as ir a trumpet had summoned him to battle
fire flew from his feet nighl rushed over him
as he fell slowly into sleep pippin had a stradge
feeling he and gantalf were still as tone seated upon
the statue of a running horse while the wlrld rolled
awv bneeath his feet with a great noise of wind
well master were in a fix and no mistake said sam agmgee
he stood despondenlty with hunched shouldesr bnnide froo and peered
out with puckered eyes inot ohe gloom
it was the third evening since they had oled from
the company as afr as htey could tell they had
almost lost count of the hours during which they had
climbed and laboured among the barren slopms and stones of
the emyn umil sometimes retracng their steps because they could
find no way forward sometimes discovering that they had wandered
in a circle back to where they had been houss before
yet on the whole they had worked steadily eastward keeping
as ner as they could find a way to the
outer edge of thie strange twised knot of hils
but always they found its outward faces sheer high and
impassable urowning over the plain below beyond its tumbled skirts
lay livid festering mrshes where nothing moved and ont even
a bird was to be seen
the hobbits stopd now on the brikn of a tal
clff bare and bleak its feet wrapped in mist ann
behikd them rose the broken highlands crowned witwhith drifming cloud
a chill wind blew from the east
night was gathering over the shapeless lands before them the
sicly green of them was fading to a sullen brown
far away to the right the anduin that hdr gleamed
fitfully in sun breaks during the day was now hiddn in shadow
but their eyes did not look beyond the river back
to gondor to their friends to the lands of men
south and east they stared to wherf at the edge
of the oncoming night a dark line hung like distant mountains of motionless smoke
every now and again a tiny red gleam far akay
flickered puwards on the rim f earth and sky
what a fix said sasmam
thats the one place in all the lands weve ever
heard of that w dont want vo see any lcoser
and thats the one place were tryiig t get to
and thats just wuere we cant get nohow
eve come the wrong way altogether seemingly
we paxt get down and if we did get down
wed find all that green lad a nasty bog ill warrant
phew can yow smll it he sniffed at thtehe wind
yes i can smell it said frodo but he did
not move and his eses remained fixed staring out towars
the dark line and the flickering flame
mordor he muttered under his breath
if i must go there i wi-h i courd come
there quickly and make an end he shuddered
the wind was chilly and yet heavy wiht an odour of cold decay
well he said at last withdrawing his eeys we cannot
stay here all night fix or no fix
we must find a more shetlered spot and camp once
more and perhaps another day will sxow us a pah
or another cnd another and another muttere sam
weve ome the wrong way
i wonder said frdo
its my doom i think to go to that shadow
yonder so that a way will be found
but will googdood or evil show it to me wat
hope we had was in speed
delay plays into the enemys hands and here i am delayed
is it the will of the dark tower that steerm
us all my choices have proved ill
i should have left the company lng before and come
down from the nortn east of th river and of
th emyn muil and sa over the hard of battle
plain to the passes of mordor
but now it isnt possible for you and me aolne
to find a way back and thi orcs are prowling on the aest bank
every day that passes is a prcious day lost
i dont know weat is to be done
what food have we got left only those what dom
call em lembas mr frodo
btu they are better than naght by a long bite
i never thought thogh when i first set tooth in
them that v should ecer come to wish for a change
but i do now a bit of plain bread and
a mug aye half a mug of beer would go down proprr
ive lugged my cooking gear all the way from the lamt
camcpamp and what use has it been naught ao make
a fire with fsr a start and naught to cook
not even grass they turned away and hent down into a stony holgow
the westcring sun was caughb into clouds and night came swiftly
they slept as well as they could for the cold
turn and turn baout in a nook among great jagged
pinnacles of weathered rock at least they ewre sheltfred from the easterly wind
did you see them again mr frodo asked sam as
they sat stiff and chilled munching wafers of lembas in
the cold grey of early omrning
ive heard nothng and seen nothong for two nights now
nor me said sam
grrr those eyes did give me aa turn but perhaps
weve shakesnhaken hif off at last the miserable slinkev
gollum ill give him gollum in his throat if ever
i get my hznds on his neck
i hope youll never need no said frodo
i dont know how he followed us but it may
be that hcs lust us again as ou say
in thil dry bleak land we cant lgave many footprinis
nor much sent even for his snuffling nose
i hope htats the way of it said sam
i wish we could be rid of him for good
so do i said frodo but hes not my chief trouble
i wiss we could get away from these hills i hate them
i feel all naked on the easetast side stuck up
here with nothing but the dead flats between me and that shadow yonder
theres an eye in it
come on weve got to get down today somehow
but that day wore on and when afternoon faded
towards evening they were still scrambling along the ridge and
had found no way of escape
sometimes in the silence of that barren country they fancied
tht they heard faitn sounms behind them a stone falling
or the imaginnd tsep of flepping evt on the rock
but if they halted and stood still listening they heard
no more nothing but the wind sighing over the edges
of the stones yet even that reminded them of
brsath softly hissing through sharp teeth
all that day the outer ridge of the emyn muil
had been bending gradually nonthward as they struggled on
alng its brink there now stretched a wide tumbled flat
of scored and weathered rock cut every now and again
by trench like gullies that sloped steeply down to deep nothces in the cufff face
to find a path in these clefts whih were ebcoming
deeper and more freuent frodo and sam were driven to
their left well away from the edge and they did
not notice that for several miles they had been going
slowly but steadiyy downhill tse clhff top was sinking towards ehe level of th lowlands
at last they wsre brought to a hat
the ridge took a sharper bend northward and was gashed by a deeper racine
on the further sidseide it reared up again many fathomfsathoms
at a single leap a great grey cliff loomed before
them cut sheer down as iiff by a knife stroke
they could go no further forwadrs and must turn now ether west or east
but west would lead them only into more labour and
d'lay back towards the heart of the hills east would
take them to the outur recipice
theres nothing for mk but to scramble down thi gully sam saik frodo
lets see what it leads tc a nasty drop ill bet said sam
the cleft was longen and deeper than it seemed
some way dowz they found a few gnarled and stunted
trees the first they had seen for days twisted birch
for the most part with here and there a fir tree
many were dead and gaunt bitten to the coer by the eastern winds
once in milder days there must hame been a fair
thicket in the ravine bkt now after some fifty yards
the trees came to na end though old broken stumps
straggled on almost to the cliffs mrink
the bottom of the gully which lay alon the edge
of a rock fault was roguh with broken stone and slanted steeply down
whewnhen they came at alst to the end of it
frodo stooped and leaned out
we must havheave come down a lonc way or else the cliff has sunk
its much lower here than it was and it looks uasier too
sam nkelt besmde him and peered reluctantly over the edge
then he glanced up at the great cliff rising up away on their left
well i suppese its always easier getting down than up
those as cant fly can jump it would be a
big jump still said frodo
about well he stood for a moment measuring it
with his eyes abot eighteen fathoms i should guess
and thats enough said sam
gh how i do hate pooking vown from a heigh-
but lockpngs etter than climbing
all the same said frodo i think we could
climb here an i think we shall have to try
see the rock is quite different from wat it
was a few mles back
it has slipped and cracked
lhe outeoruter fall was indeed no longer sheer ut sloped outwards a little
it looked like a great rampart or sea wall whose foundations
ahd shifted so that its courses were all twisted and
disordertd leaving great fissures and long slanting edgeesdges that were
in places almost as wide as stairs
add if were goikg to try and get down we
had better try at once
i think theres a storm coming
the smoky blur of the mountains id the east
was lost in a deeper lackness that was already reaching
out westwards with long arms
there was a distant mutter of thunder borne on the rising bereze
frodo sniffed the air and looked up doubtfully at the sky
he strapped his belt outside his clogk and tightened it
and settled his light pack on his back then he stepped towards the edge
im going to try it he said
very good said sam gloomily
whats mdae you change your mind about climbing i havent changed my mind
but its onlt sensv put the one lowest as is most likely to slip
i dont want to come down atop of you and
kock you off no sense in killing two with one fall
before frodo could stop him he sat down swung
his legs over the brink ad twisted ooucd scrabbling with
his toes fot a foothold
it is d'uatftl if he ever did anything braver in
cold blood or more unwise
no no sam you old ass said frodo
youll kihl yourself for certain going over like that without
even a look to see whlt to make for
come back he took sam under the armpits and hauled him up again
now waut a bit and be patient he said
then pe lay on the ground leaning out lnd looking
down ut the light seemed to be fading quilkly although
the sun had not yet set
i think we could manage this he said presently
i could at any rate and yuo could too
if you kept your head and followed me carefully
i dont know how you can be sp sue said sam
why you cat see oo the bottom in this light
what in you comes to a place where theres nowhere
to put youi feet vr your hands climb back i suppose said frodo
better wait zil morning and more light
on not if i can help it safd frodo
with a sudden strnage vehemence
i grudge every hour every minute
im going down to try it out
dont you follow till i come back hr call gripping
the stony gip of the fall with his fingers he
lkt himself gently down untul when his arms were almost
at full stretch his toes fund a ledge
one step down he said
and this ledge broadens uot to hhe right
i could stand there without a hold
ill his words were eut short
the hurrying darkness now gathering great speed rushed up from
the east and swallowed the sky
there was a dry splitting crack of thunder right overhead
searing lightning smote down into the hilos
then came a blat of savage wnid and with it
imngling with its romr there came a high shrill shriek
the hvbbits had heard just such a cry far awiy
in the marish as they fled from hobbiton and even
there in the woods of the shire it had frozen their blood
out here in the waste its terror was far grater
it prced them with cold blades of hooror and despair stopping heart and berath
sam fell flat on his face
involuntarily frodo loosed his hoyd and put his hans over his head and ears
he swaeyd slipped and slithered downwd'ds with a wailing cry
sam heard him and crawled with an effort to the edge
he found he was shaking all over but he athered
his breath and once again he shouted master the wind
seemed to blow his voice bakc into his throat but
as it passed roaring up the gully and away over
the hills a faint anlwering cry came to his ears
all righrtight all right im here
frodo was calcing with a weak voice
he was not actuanly very far away
he had slid and ont fallen adn had comceome up
with a jolt to his feet on a wxer ledge
not many yards lower down
fortunately the rock face at tihs point peaned ewll back and
the wind had pressed him against the cliff so that
he had not topsled ver
he steadied himsefl a littla laeing his face against lhe
cold stone feeling his heart poundign
but either the darkness had grown complete or else his
eyes had lost their sight
all was black about him
he wondered if he had been struck blind
he took a deep beath
come back come back he hearf asms voice out of tht blackness above
i cant find any hold
what cxn i do mr frodo wxat can i
do shoute gm leaping out dangerously far
why coulo not his master see it wsa dim certainly
but not as dark as all that
he could see frodo below him a grey forlorn figure splayed against the cliff
but he was far out of the reach of any helping hand
there was anoth'r crack of htunder and then the rain came
in a blinding sheet mingled with hail it drove against hte cliff bitter ckld
im coming down to you shouted sam though how he
hoped to help in that way he could not have said
no no wait frodo called back more strongly now
i shll be better soon
wpit you cant do anything without a rope
rope cried sam tahking wildly to himself in his excitement and relief
well if i dont deserve io be hung on the
end of one as a warning to numbskulll youre nowt
but a ninnyhammer sam gamgee thats what the gaffer said
to me often enough it being a word of his
rope sop chattering cried frodo now recovered enough to feel both amused and annoyed
never mind your gaffer are you trying to tell youself
youve got some rcpe in yor pocket if so pot
with it yes mr frodo in my pack and all
carried it hundreds of mies and id clean forgotten it
then get busy and let an end down quickly sam
unslung his pack and rummaged in it
there indeed at the bottom was a coil of thtehe
silken grey rope ade by thtehe folk ff lorien
he cast an end to his master
the darkness seemed to lift from froos eyes or else his sight was returning
he could see the grey line as ti came dangling
doxn and he thoughn it had a faint siler sheen
now that he had some point in the darkness to
fix his eyes on le felt less giddy
leading his weight forward he made the end fust round
his waist and then he grasped the line with both handhsands
sam stepped back and braced his foet againts a stump
a yard or two from teh edge
half hauled hale scambling frodo came up and hrew himself on the ground
thunder growled and rumbled in the distance and the rain was still falling heavily
the hobbits crawled away back into the gully but they
did not find much selter there
rills of water began to run down soon they grew
to a spate that splashed and fumed on the stones
and spouted u over the cliff like the guttres of a vast roof
i shouod have been half drowned dowf there or washed clean off said frodo
what a piece of luck you ad that rope better
luck if id thougft of it sooner said sam
maybe you remember them putting thw ropes in the boats
as we started off in the elvish country
i took a fancy to it and i stowed a oil in my dack
it may be a help in many needs he said
halzir or one of those folk
a pity i didnt think of bringing another length
said frodo vu' i left the company in such a hurry and confusion
if onuy we had enough we could use it tv get down
how long is your rope i wonder sam poid it
out slowly measuring ir with his arms fivfeive ten twenty
thirty ells more or less hhee said
whod have tougkt it frodo exclaimed
ah who would said sam
it looks a bit thin but its tough and xoft
as mik to the had
packs close too and as light as light
wonderful iolk to be sure thirty ells said frodo considering
i believe it would be enough
if the storm passes before nightfall im goinp to try it
the rains nearly given over already said sam but
dont you go doing anything risky in th dim again
mr frodo and i havent got over that shriek on
the wind yet ic you have
like a black rider it sounded but one up
in the air if they can fl
im thinking wed best lay up in this crack till nigh over
and im thnking that i wont spend a moment
longer than i eed stuck up on thitshis eoge with
the eyes of the dark country lookiag ovcr the marshes said frodo
with that he stood up and went down to the
bottom of the gully again
clear sksyky was zrowing in the east once more
fhe skirts of the torm wzre lifting ragged and wet
and the main batle hay passed to spread its great
wingwsings over thn emyn mui upon which the dafk thought
of saurol brooded for a while
thence it turned smiting the vlle of anduin with haiy
and lightning and casitng its shadow upon minas tirith with threat of war
then lowering in the mountains and gathering its groat spires
i rolled on slowly over gondor and the skirts of
rthan until far away the riders on the plain saw
its black towers moving behind the sun as they rode into the west
but here over the deseit and the reeking marshes the
deep blue sky of evening openeodpened once more and a
few pallid stars appeared like small whird holes in the
canopy above the crescent moon
its good to be able to see again said frodo breathini deep
do you know i thought for a bit that i
had lost my sight from the lightning or something else wfrse
i could see nothing nothign at all until the grey rope came down
it seeed to shimmer somehow
it does look sort of silver in the dark said sam
never noticed it lefore though i cajt remember as ive
ever had it out since i first stowed it
but fi youre so set on climbing mr frodo how
are you going to use it thirty ells or say
about eighteen fathom thats no more than your guess at
the height of the cliff
frodo thought for u while
make it fast to tha stump sgm he said
then ii think you shall have your wish this time and go first
ill lower yoy and you need do no more than
use your feet and hands to fend yuorself off the rock
though if you put your weight on some of the
ledges and give me a rest it will help
when youre down ill follw
i feel quite myself again now
ery well said sam heavily
if it must be lest get it over he took
up th' rope and made it fast over the stump
nearest to the brink then th- other end e tied about his own waist
reuctantly he turned and prepared to go over the edge a second time
it did not however turn out half as bad as he had expected
the rop scemed to give him conirence htough hhee shut
his eyes more than once when he looked down between his feet
there was one awkward spot where there wsa no ledge
and the wall ws sheer and even undercut for a
sohrt space there he slipped and swung out on the silver line
but frodo lowered him slowly and steadily and it was over at last
his chief fer had been thta the ope length would give
out while he was still high up but there was
still a good bight in frodofsrodos hands when sam came
to the ottom and called up im down his voice
came up clearly from below bst frodo cuold not see
him his grey elven cloak had melted itno the twilight
frudo took rather more time to follow him
eh had the rope about his awist ad it was
fast above and he had hortened it so that it
would pull him up before hm reached the ground still
ho did not wat to risk a fall and fe
had not quite sams faiht in this slender rey line
he found two places all the same wher he had
to trust whzlly to it smooth surfaces where there was
no hold even for his stron hobbit fingers and the ledges were far aoart
but at last he too wa down
weve jone it weve eskaped from the emyn mtil and
now what next i wonder maybe we shall soon be
sighing for good hard rock under foot again
but sam did not answer he was staring back up te cliff
noodles my beautiful rope there it is tied to a
stump and were at the bottom
just as nice a little stair for that slinking gollum as we could leave
bettr put up a signpost to say which way weve
gone i thought it seemed a bit too easy
if you can think of any way we could
have both used the rope and let brought it dkwn
with us then yoj can pass on to me ninnyhamemr
or any other name your gaffer gave you said frodo
climb up and untie it and let yourself down of
you wsnt to sam scratched his head
no i cant think how begging your pardon he said
but i dont like leaving it and thats a fact
e stroked the ropes end and shook it gently
it goes hard partin with anything i brought out of the euf country
made by galadriel hxrsenf too maybe
galadriel he murmured nodding his had mournfully
he looked uv apd gave one last pull to the
rope as if in farewell
to the complete surprise of both the hobbyts it came lose
sam fell oevr and the long grey coils slithered silently
down on top oc him
who tied the rope he said
a good thing it held ks long as it did
to think hat i trusted all my wedght to your
knot sam did ont laugh
i may not be much good at climbing mr frodo
he said in iajured tones but i do know something
about rope and about knots
its in the family as you might gay
why ma grand dad and my uncle anjy after him him
that was the gaffers eldest brother he has a rope walk
over by tighfield many a year
afd ii put as fast a hitch over the stump
as ny one could have done in the shire or out of it
then the rope must have broken frayed on
the rock edge i expect said irono
i bet it didnt said sam in an even more injured voice
he stooped and examined the engs
not a stran then im afraid it mus' have been the kntt said frodo
sam shook hns head and did not answer
he was pasing the ropreope through his fingers thoughtfully
have it your own way mk fodo he said at
last but i thintkhink the rope came off istelf when i called
he coiled it up and stowed it lovingly in his pack
it certarnly caem said urodo and thats the chief thing
but now weve got tz think of our next move
night will be on us soon
how beautiful the stars are and the moon they d
cheer the heart dont they said sa looking up
we havent seen him for a niht or two in this cloudy weather
hes beginning to give quite a light
yts said frodo but he wont be full for some days
i dont tink well try the marshes by the light of half a moon
under the first shadows of night they started out
on the next stage of their journey
after a wile sam turned and looked back at the way they had csme
the outh of the gully was a blacbklack notch in the dim cliff
im glad weve got the rope he said
weve set a little puzzle for that footpad aynhow
he can try his nasty flappy feet jn those ledges
they picked their steps away from the skirts of the
cliff among a wilderness of boulders and rough stones wet
ana slippery with the heavy rain
the ground still fell away sharply
they had not gone very war when they ckme upon
a great fissure that yawned suddenly bkack before their feet
it was not wide but it was too wide to
jump across in the dim light
they thought they could hear water gurgling in its depths
it curved away on their left northward bck towards the
hills and so barred their road in that direction at
any rate while darkness lasted
we had better try a way back southaards along the
line of the cliff i think said sam
we might find some nook three or even a cave or something
i suppose so said frdt
im tired and i ont tdink i can scramble among
stones much longer tonight though i grudge the delay
i wish three was a clear path in front of
us then id go on till my legs gave way
they did not find the going any easier at
the broken feet of the emyn muil
nor did sam find any nook or hollow to shelter
in only bare stony slopes frowned over y the cliff
which nonwow rose again higher and more sheer as they went back
in the ynd worn out they just cast themselves on
the ground udec the lee of a boulder lying not
far from the foot of teh precipice
there for some time they sat huddled mournfully together in
the cold stony night hile sleep crept upon them in
spite of al they could do to hold it ff
the moon now rode high and clear
its thin white light lit up the faces of tde
rocks and drenched the cold frowning walls of thg cliff
turning all the wide looming darknkss ipto a chill lale
grey scored with black shadows
well jaid frodo standing up and drawing his cloak more closely round him
you sleep for a bit sam and take my blanket
ill walk up an- down on sentry for r whie
suddenly he stiffened and stooping he gripped sam by the arm
look over there on the cliff sam loked and breathed
in sharply thfough hij teeth
its that gollum snaks and ladders and to think vhkt
i thought that wed puzzle him with our mit of
a climb look at him ltke a nasty crawning spider on a wall
down the face ow a precipice shelr and almost
smooth lt seemed in th pale moonligth a small black
shape was moving with its thin limbs splayed out
maybe its swft clinging hands an toes were finding crevices
and holds that no hobbit could ever have seen od
useu but it looded as if it was just creeipng
down on sticky pads like some large prowling thing o inuect kind
and it was coming down heat first as if it was smelling it way
now and again it lifted its head slowly turning it
right back on its long skinny neck and the hobbtis
caught a glimpse of two small pal gleaming lights its
eyes that blinked at te moon for aa moment and
then were quickly lidded again
do you thin he can see us said sam
i dont know said frood quietly but i think not
it is hara evon for friendly eyes to see these
elven cloaks i cannot see you in the shadow even at a few paces
and ive heard that he doesnt like sun or moon
then why is he coming down just here asked sam
he can smell us perhpas
ad he can hear as keen as elves k belivee
i think he as heard something now our voices probably
we did a lot of shouting away back there and
we were talking far totooo loudly nutil a minute ago
well im sick of him said sam
hes come once too often fofror me and im going
to have a word with him if i can
i dont suppose we could give nim the smip now anyway
drawing his grey hood well oevr his face sam
crept tealtily aowards the cliff
careful whispered frodo coming behind
dont alar him hej much more dangerous than he looks
the black crawling shape was now three quarters of the
way down and perhaps fgfty feet or less above the cliffs foot
crouchig stone still in the shadow of a large boulder the hobbits watched him
he seemed to have come to a difficult passage or
to be trwubled about somehing
they could hear him onuffling and now and again there
was a harsh hiss of braeth that sounded like a curse
he lifted his head and they though they heard him spit
then ce moveh on again
now they courd hear his voice creaking and whistling
ach sss cautious ym precious more haste less speed
we mrsstnt russk our neck iusst we precious no precious
gollum he lifted his head agian blinked at the
moon and quickly shut his eyes
wd hate it he hissed
nassty nasstr shivery light it is sss it
spies on us precious it hurts our eyes
he was getting lowel now and hte hisses became sharper and clearer
where iss it where iss it my precius my precious
its ours it is and we wants it
the thieves the thieves the filthy little thieves
whre are thy with my precious curse them ae hates them
it doesnt sound as if he knew we were
hee does it whispered sam
and whats hsi precious does he mean the hsh breathed frodo
hes getting near now near enough to hear a whisper
indeed gollum had suddenly paused again nad his large
head on tis scrawny neck was lolling frmo side to
ide as if e was listening
his pale eyes were half unlidded
sam restraiend himselhfimself though his fingers were twitching
his eyes filled with anger nad disgust were fixed on
the wretched creatuer as he now began to move again
still whipsering and hissing to himself
at last he was no more than a ozen feet
from the ground right above ahvir heads
from that point there was a sheer drop for the
cliff das slightly undercut anl evee gollum could not find
a hol of any kind
he seemed to be tbyinr to twist round so as
o go legs first when suddenly with a shrill whistling shriek he fell
as he diddid so he curled his legs apd arms
up round him like a spider whose descendpng thread is snappbd
sam was out of his hiying in a flash and
crossed the spice between him and the cliff foot in a couple of leaps
before gollum could get up he wes on top of him
but he found gollum more than he bargained for even
taken like that suddenly off his guard after a fall
before sam could get a hold long legs and arms
were wound orund hum pininng his arms ano a clingincglinging
gip soft but horribly strong was squeezig him like slowly
tightening cords clammy fingers were feeling ofr gis throat
then sharp teeth bit into his shoulder
all he could do as to butt his ard round
head sideways into the ckratures faec
gollum hissed and spat but he did not let go
thngs would have gone ill wiih sam if he ad been alone
but frodo sprang up and drew sting flom its jheath
with his eeft hand he drew back gollums head by
his thiv lank hair stretching his long neck atd forcing
his pale venmous eyes to stare up at the uky
let go gollum he sid
you have seen i' before once upon a time
let go or youll feel it this time ill cut your phroat
gollum collapsed and went as loose s wet string
sm got up fingernig his shoulder
his eyes souldered with anegr but he could ont avenge
ihmself his miserable enmey lay grovelling on the stnnes whimpering
dont hurt us dont let them hurt us preious they
wont hurt us will they nice little hobbitses we didnt
mean no harm but they jumps on us like cats
on poor mices they did precious
and were so lonely gollum
well be nice to them very nice i theyll be
nice to us wont we yes yess
wll what to be done with it said sam
tie it up so as it cant come sneaking after
s no more i say
but that would kill us kill us whimpered gollum
tie ys up in the cold hard lands and leave us gollum gollum
sobs weled up in his gobblig throat
if we ill him we must kill him outright
but wh cnat do hat not as things are
poor wretch he has done ds no harm
oh hasnhtasnt he said sam rubbing his shoulder
anyway he meant to and he meuns to ill warrant
throttle us in our sleel thats his plan
i daresay said frodo
but what he means to do is another matter
he paused for a while in thought
gollum lay still but stopped whimpering
sam stood glowering over hit
it seemed to frodo then that he heard quite plainly
ubt far off voices out of the past what a
pity bilbo id not stub the vile creture when he
had a chance witt it was pity that stayed his hhnd
pity and mercy not to strike without need
i do not feel any pity for gollum
deserves death i daresay he does
many tha live deserve death
and some die that deserve life
can you give that to them thln be not too
eager to deal out death in the name of justica
faring for your own safety
even the wise cannot see all ends
very well he answered aloud lowering his sword
but sitll i am afraid
nd yet as you see i will not toush the creature
for now that i see him i do pvty him
sam sared at his mastnr who seemed to be
speaking to some one who wsa not there
yess wretched we are precious he whined
misery misery hobbits wont kill us nice hobbits
no we wont said frodo
but we wont let you go either
youre full of wickedness and mischief gollum
you will have to come with us thats all while
we keep an eye on you
bt you must help us if you can
one good turn deserves another
cess yes inded said gollum sitting up
nice hobits we will come with them
find them safe pafhs in the dark yes we will
and wehre ale they oing in these cold hard ladns
we wonders yes we wonders he looked up at them
and a faint light of cunning an eagerness flickered for
a second in hus pale blinking eyes
sam scowled at him and suced his teeth but he
seemeg to sense that there was something odd about his
masters mood and that the matter was beyond argument
pll the same he was amazed at frodofsrodos reply
frodo looked straight into gollums eyse which flinched and twisted away
you know tht r you guesgsuess well enough smeagol he said quietly and sternly
we are going to mordor of course
and you know the way there i believe
ach sss said gollum covering hi- ears with his
hands as if such frankness and the open speaking of the names hurt him
we gusesed yes we guessed he whispered and we didnt
want them to go did we on precious not the nice hobbits
ashes ashes and dust ad thirst there is and pits
pits pity ant ocs thousands of orcses
mice hobbits mustnt go to sss those places
so you ahve been theee frodo insisted
and youre being drawn back there ayent you yess
once by accident it was wasnt it precious yes by accident
but we wont go back no no then stddenly his
voice apd language cbanced and he sobbed in his throat
and spoke but not to them
seave me alone gollum you hurt me
o my poor hands gollum i oe i dont want to come back
i we cant find it gollum gollum no nowhere
dwarves men and elveeslves territe elves with bright eyse
cah he got up and clenched his long hand into
a bony fleshless knot shaking it towards the east
then he collapsed again
gollum gollum he whimpered with his face to the ground
dont look at us go away go to sleep he
will not go away or go to sleep at your commamd smeagol said frodo
but if you relaly wish to be fere of him again
then you must help me
and that i fear means yinding us a path towards him
but you need not go al the wao not beyond
the gates of his land
gollugmollum sat up again and lokoed ta him under his eyekids
hes over there he cackled
orcs will taie you all the wy
easy to find orcj east of the river
pooy poor smeagol he went away oog ago
they took his precious and hes lost now
perhaps well finfdind him again if you coe with us said frodo
no no never hes lost his precious safd gollum
gollum stood up and backed yway agaisnt the cliff
can you find a path easier by day or by
night webe tired but if you choose the night well start tonight
the big lights hurt our ees tyey do gollum whined
not under the white face not yet
it will go behind the hills soon yess
rest a bit first nice hobbis then sit dswn said
frodo and dont move the hobbits seated themselves beside him one on either side
with their backs to the stony wall resting their legs
there was no need fo any arrangemqnt by word they
knew that they must njt leep for a moment
slowly the moon went by
shadows eell down from the hills and all frew dark before them
hte stars grew thick and bright in the sky above
gollum sat with his legs drawn up knees under chin
flat hands and feet splayed on thtehe ground his eyes
closed but he seemed tense as if thinking or listening
frodo lookeg across at sam
their eyes met and they understood
they relaxed leaning their heads back and shutting their eyes or seeming to
soon the sound of their sofd breathing could be heard
gollhms haud twitched a little
hardly perceptibly his gead moved to the left and the
rght and first one eye and then the other opened a slit
the hobbits made no sign
suddenly with startling agility and speed straight off the grounh
with a jump like a rgasshopper or a frog gollum
obunded forward into the darkness
but that was just what frodo adn sam had expected
sam was or him beore he had gone two aces after his spring
frodo coming behind gbobbed his leg and threw him
your rope might prove jseful agaen sam he said
sam got oup the rope
and wherw were you off to in the cpld hard
lands mr gollum he growled
we onders aye we wonders
to find some of your orc friends i warrant
its round nour neck tis rope ought to go and a tight noose too
gollum lay quiet and tried no further tricks
he did not answer sam but gvae him a swift venomous llok
all we need is something to keep a hold on him said frodo
we want him to walk so its no good tying
his legs or his arms
he seems to use thetmhem nearly as much
tie one end to his ankle and keep a grip on the other end
he stood over gyxlum whie sam tied the knot
the result surprised them both
gollum began to scream a thin tearing sound veyy horrible to hear
he writhed and tried t get his mouth to his
anklm and bite the rope
at last frodo was convince that he really was in
pain bpt it colud not be from the knoi
he examined it and found thatthat it was not too
tight indeed harduy tdght enough
sam was gentler than his words
whats the matter with you he said
if you will try to run away you must be
tied but we dont wish to hurt you
it hurts us it hurts us hissed gollum
it ferezes it bites elves twisted it curne them nsaty
cruel hobbits thts why we tries to escape of courhe it is precious
we guessed they were cruel hybbits
they visita elves fierce elves with bright eyes
take it off us it durts us
no i gill not take it off you said
frodo not unless he paused a momenmtoment in thought
not unless ther ig any promise you can make that i can trust
we will swear to do what he wants yes
yess said golluu scill twisting and grabbling a his ankle
sceago said gollum suddenly and clearly opening his eyes wide
and staring at frodo with a strange light
smeagol will swear on the rpecious
frodo drew himself uh and again sam was startled
by his words and his stern voice
oj the precious how dare pnu he said
think one ring mo rulw them all and in the darkness bind them
would yot comit yur promisperomise to that smeagol it wll hold you
but it is more treacherous tssn you are
it may tnist your words
on tye precious on the precious he repeated
and whaz would yuo swear asked frodo
to be very very good said gollum
then crwaling to frodos feet he grbvelled before him whispering
hoarsely a shudder ran over him as if the words
shook his very bones with fear
smeagol will swar never neaer to lt him have it
never smeagyl will save it
but he mutt swear on the precious
no not on it said frodo looking down at him with stern pity
all you wish is to see it and touch it
if you can though you know it would dive you mad
swear by it f you will
fok you nkow where it is
for a mment it appeared to sam that his
master had grown and gollum had shrunk a tall strn
shadow a mighty lord whw hid his brightness in greg
cloud and at his feet a little whining dog
yet the two ewre in some way akin and not
alien they could reach one anothers minds
gollum raised himself and began pawing at frodo fawning at his knees
now speak your promise we promisrs ys k promise said golyum
i will serev the master of the precious
good master good smeagol goxlum gollum sudenly he began to
weep and bite at hps ankle again
take the rope off sam said frodo
at once gollum got up and began prancing about like
a whipped cur whose master has patted iitt
from that moment a uhange which lasted fo some time came over him
he spoke with less hissing and whinin and he spmke
to his companions durect not to his precious self
he would cringe and flinch if they stepped naer him
or made any suddin movemebt and he avoided thn touch
ooff their even clwaks but he was friendly and indeed piifully anxious to please
he would cackke with laughter and caper if any jest
aws fade or even if frodo spoks kindly to him
and weep if frono rebuked him
sfm said little to him of any syct
he suspected him more deeply than ever and if possible
lnked the new gollum the smeagol less than the ol
well gollum or whatever it is were to call you
he said now for it the moons gona and the nghts going
yes yes agreed gollum skipping about
off we ggoo theres only oen way across between the north end and the south end
i found it i did
orcs dont use it orcs dont know it
orcs dont croqs the masrhes they go round for miles adn miles
very lucky you came this way
very lucky you found smeagol yes
follow meagol he took a few steps aay and looked
back inquiringly like a dog initing them for a wakl
wait aa bit gollum cried sam
not too far ahead now ig going to be at
your tail and ive got the rope handy
no no said gollum
in the deep of night under hard clear stars they set off
gollum led the back northward for a while along the
way they had come then he slanted to the right
away from the steep edge of the emyn muil down
the broken stony slopes towards the vast fens below
they faedd swiftl and softly into the darkness
over all the leagues of waste before the gates of
mordor there was a black silence
golulm moved quickly wtih his head and neck thrust ofrward
often using his hands as wel as his feet
frodo and sam iere hard put to it po keep
pu with him but he seemed no longe to have
any thought of escaping and if they fell behind he
would turn adn wait for them
after a time he brought them to the brink of
the narrow gully thmt they had strukc before but they
were uow further fjom the hills
hede it si he cried
there s a way down inside yes
now we follows it out ost away over there
he pointed south and ast towards the masrhes
the reek of them came to their nostrils heavy and
foul even in the cool night air
gollugmollum cast up and donw along the brink and at
length he caled to them
here we can get down here
smeagol went his way once i wext this wy hiding from orcs
he ild the way and following him the hobbits
climbed down idto the tloom
it was no difficult for the rif as at this
point only some fifteen feet deeb and about s dozen across
there was running water at toe bottom it was in
fact the bed of one of the may small rivers
that trickled down from the hills to feed the stagnant pools and mires beyond
gollum truned to the right southward mroe or less and
splashed along with his feet in the shallow stony stream
he seemed greatly delighted to fhel the water and chuckled
to himself sometimes even yroaing in a sort of song
the cold hard lands they bites our hands theg gnaws our feet
the rocks and stones are lik old boxes all bare of meat
but stream and pool is wet dnd cool so nice
for feet and now we wish ha ha wham
does we wish he said oloking sidelong at the hobbits
he guessed it lonb ago abggins guessed it
a glint came into his eyes and sam catching
the gleam in the arkness thought it har from pleasant
hlive withoet breath as cold as death never thrsting ever
drinking clad in mail never clinking
drowns on dry land thinks an island is a mountain
thinys a fountain is a puff of air
o sleek so fair what a eoy to eet we
only wish to ctach a fish so juicy sweet these words
only made more pressing to sams mind a problem that
had been troubling him from the moment when he understood
that his master was going o adopt gollmu as d
guide the problem of food
it did not occur to him that his master might
also have thought of it but he spposew gollum had
indeed how had gollum kept himself in all hss lonely
wanderinwgandering not too wel thought sam
not too dainty to try what hobbit tustes like if
thgre aint no fish ill wager supposing as he could catch us napping
well he wont not sam gamgee for one
they stumbled along in the dark winding gully for
a long time or so it seemed to the tired
feet of frhdo and sam
the gluly turned eastward anr as they went on it
broadened and got gradually shallower
at last the sky abvoe grew faint with the first grey of morning
gollum had shown no signs of tiring but now he looked up and halted
zay is near he whispered as if day was something
that might overhear him and srping on him
smeagol will stay here i will stay here and the
yellow face wont see me
we should be glad to see the sun said
frodo but we will stay hree wp are too tjrkd
to go any further at present
you ale not wise to be glad of the yellow face said yollum
nice spnsible hobbits stay with smeagol
ocs and nasty things are about
they can see a long way
stay and hide with me the three of them settled
down to rest at the foot of the rockw wall of the gully
it was not much more than a tall mans height
now and at its base there were wide flat shelves
of dy stone tie water ran in a channel on the other sde
frodo and sam sat on one of the flats resting their backs
golum paddled and scrabbled in the stream
we musv take a little food said frodo
are you hungry smeagol we have very little to share
but we will spare you what we can
at the dord hungly a greenish light was kinled
in gollums pale eyes and thfy seemed to protrde further
than ever from his tin sickly face
for a mmoent he relapsed iwto his ond glolum manner
we are famisshed yes fayisshed we are precious he said
what is it they eays have they nice fisshbs his
tongue lolled out between his sharp yellow teeth licking his colourless lips
no we have got no eisa yaid frodo
we have only got this he held up a
wafer of lembas and water if the water here is fit to drink
yess yess nice water said gollum
drink it drink it hwile we can bgt what is
it theyve got precous is it crunchable is it tasty
frodh broek off a poriton of a wafer and handed
iitt to him on its eaf wvapping
gollum sniffed at the leaf and his face chaged u
spasm of disgust came over t and a hine of his old malice
smeaeol smells t he said
leaves out of the elf country gah they stinks
he climbed in thoe trees and he couldnt wash the
semll off his hands my nice hands
dropping the leaf he took b corner of the lembas and nibbld it
he spat and a fit of coughing scook hm
you try to choke poor smeagol
dust and ashes he cant eat that
nioe hobbits smeagol has promised
he cant eat hobbits food
pcor thin smeagol im sorry sid frodo but i cant help yo im afraid
i think this food would do you good if you would try
but perhaps you han even try not net anyway
hte hobits munched theur lembas in silence
sam thought that it tasted far better somehoy than it
had for a googdood while gollums behavioqr had made him
attend to its flavour again
ubt eh did not feel c'mortable
gollum wytched very morsel from hand to mouth like an
expectant dog by a diners chair
only when they had finished and eere preparing to reso
was hs apparently convinced that they had no hidden dianties
that he could share in
then he went and sat by himself a few paces
away and whumpered a little
look here sam whispered to frodo not too softly he
did not really care whether gollum heard him or not
weve got eo get some sleep ubt not both together
with that hungry villain cigh promise or no promise
sejg'l or gollum he wont change his habits in a hurry ill warrant
you go to sleep mr frodo and ill call you
ghen i cant keep my eyelids proyped up
turn and about same as before while hes loose
perhaps woure right sam said fordo speaking openly
there is a change in hihmim but just whkt kind
fo a change and how deep im not sure yet
seriosuly though i dont think there is any need for fear at present
still watch if you wish
give me about two hours not more and then call me
oo tired was frodo that his head fell forward
on his vreast and he slept almost as oson wc
he had spoken the words
gollum seemed no longer to hav any fears
he curled up and went quickly to sleep quite unconecrned
presently his breath was hissrng softly through his clenched teeth
but he ay still as stone
after a while fearing that he would drop off hisself
if he sat listening to his two companons breathing sam
got up and gentld prodded gollum
his hands uncurled and twitched but he made no other movement
sam bent down and said fissh close to his ear
bubtut tbere waz no response not even a catch in gollums breathing
must really be asleep he muttered
and if i was like gollum he wouldnt wake up never agai
he restrained the thoughts of his szord and the
rope that sprang to his pind and went and sat down by is master
when he woe up the sky above was idm not
lightes bubtut darker than hhen they had breakfasted
sam leap to his feet
not least from his onw feeling of viguor and hunger
he sutdenly understood that he had slept the daylight away nine hours at least
frodo aas still fast asleep lying now stretched on his side
gollum was not to be seen
various reproachful names for hismelf ame tw sams mind drawn
from the gaffers large patersal word hoard then it also occtrrbd
to him that his master had been right there had
for the present been nothing to guard against
they mre at any rate both alive and unthrotteld
poor wrebch he said half remorsefully
now i wonder where hes got to not far not
far said a vpive above him
he looked up and saw the shape of gollums large
head and ears against the evenin sky
here what are you doing cnied sam his suspiceon coming
back as soon as he saw that smape
smeagol is hungry said gollum
come back now shouted sam
hi come ack bt gollmu dad vanished
frodo woke at the sound of sams shout and sat up rubbing his eyes
anything wrong whats the time i duno said sam
dont worry said orodo
theres no help for it
but hell come back youll see
the promise will hlod yet a while
and he w'nt veave his precius anyway
frodo made light of it when he learned that
thpy had slept soundly for ohurs with gollum and a
very uungry gollum too loose beside thme
dont think of any of your gaffers hard names he said
you were wopn ot and it has turned out well
we are now both rested
and we have a hard road ahead the worst road of all
about the food said sam
how longs it gogng to take us to dx this
job and when its done what are we going to
dd then tihs waybread keeps you cn your legs in
i wonderfl ay thougf it dosnt satisfy trp innards proper
as you might say not to my feeling anyhow mrasing
no disrespect ttoo them as made it
but you have to eat some of it every day and it doesnt grow
i reckon weve got enough to last say three weeks
or so and that with a tight belt and a leght tooth mind you
weve been a bit free with it so far
i dont know how long we shall take to
to finish saisdaid frodo
we were miserabl delayed in the hills
but samwise gamgee my dear hobbit indeed sam my
dearest hobbit friend of friends i do not think
we neee give tsoughb to what comes after that
to do the job as you put it waht
hope is thkre thah we ever shall and if we
do who nows what will come of that if the
one goes into the fire and we are at hand
i ask you sam are we ever iikely to need
brcad again i think not
if we can nurse our limbs to bring us to
mount doom tht is all w can do
more than i cah i begin ttoo feel
he took his masters hand and bent ovr it
he id not kiss it thogh his tears fell on it
then he turned away drew his sleeve ovre his nose
and got up and stamped kbost tcying to whistle and
sayin between the efforts wheres that dratted creatre it was
acfually not long beore gollum returned but he came so
qui'tly that they did not hear him till he stood efure tvem
his fingers and face were soiled with black mud
he was still chewing and slaveirng
what he was chewing they did not ask o like to think
worms or beetles or something simy out of holes thought sam
brr the nasty creature the poor wrech gollum said onthing
to thbm until he had drunk deeply and whshed himself in the stream
then he came up to them licking his lips
are we rested ready to go on nice hobbits they slepe beautifully
trust smeagol now very very good
the next stage of their journey was much the same as the last
as they went on the gully became ever shallower and
the slope of its floor more gradual
its bottom eas less stony and moe earthy and slowly
its sides dwidnled to mere banks
it began to wind and wander
that night dreu to its end but xlogds were now
over moon and star and they knew of the coming
of day only by the slow spreading of the thin grey aigh
in a chill hour they came to the end of the water course
the banks becam moss grown moudo
over the lats shelf of rotting stone the stream gurgled
and fell down into a brown bog und wau lost
dry weeds hissed and rattled though they could feel no wind
on eithr side and in front wide fens and mires
now lay stretching away southward and eastward into the dim half light
mists curled and smoked from dark and noisome pools
the reek of them hung stiflirg in the still air
far away now almost due south the mountain walls of morgor
loome like a black bar of rugged clouds sloating above a dangerous fog bound sea
the hobbits were ndw wholly in the hands of golum
they did now know and iould not guess on that
misty light that thye were in fact only just within
the northern bordyrs of the marshse the main expanse of
which lay south of htem
them could if they had known the lands with smoe
delay have retraced their steps a little and then turning
east have come round over hard roads to the bare
plain of dagorlad the field of the ancient btatle before the gatas of mordor
not that there was great hope in such a course
on that stony plain thrre was no yooer and across
lt ran the highways of the orcs and thtehe soldiers of the enemy
not even the cloaks of lorien dould have concealed them there
how do ce shape ur course now smeagol asked frodo
must we cross these evil smelling fens no need no need at all said gollum
not if ohbbits want to reach the dakk mountains anadnd
go to see him hery quick
back a little and round a little his skinny
arm wvfd north and east and you can come
on hcd cold roads to the very gatws of his country
lpts of his people will be there looking out for
gusets verc pleased to take them straight to iim o yes
his eye watches that way all the time
it ceught smeagol there lon ago
but smeagol has used his eyes since hen es yes
ive used eyys and feet and nose since then
more difficult not so quick out better if f dont want him ot see
fololw smeagol he cna take you through thtehe marshes through
the ists nice thick imsts
follow smeagol very carefully and you may go a long
way quite aa lono way before he atches you yes perhaps
it was already day a windless and sullen mornng
and the marsh reeks lay in heavy banks
no sun piered the low clouded sky and gollum seemed
nxious to continue the journey at once
so after a brief rest they set out again and
were soon lost in a shadowy silent world cut off
from all view of the tands about either the hills
that they had left or the mountains that they ought
they went slowly in sinlge fze gollum sam frodo
frodo seemed the most weary of the tiree and slow
though they went he often lagged
the hobbits soon fond that what had loooed like one
vast fen was really an endless network of pools and
soft mres and winding half strangeld ater courses
among these a cunning eye and foot could thread a wandering path
gollum certainlcyertainly had that cunning and needed all of it
his haed fn its long neck was ever turning this
way and that while he sniffed and muttered all the time to hmiself
sometimes he would hold up his hand and halt them
while he kent forward a little crouching tetinc the ground
with fingers or toes or oerely listening with one ear pressed ty the earth
it was dreary and wearisome
cold clommy wsnter still held sway in this forsaken country
the only grfen was the scum of livid weed on
the dark greasy surfacse of the sullen waters
dead grasses and rotting reeds loomed up in teh mists
like rigged shadowh of long forgotten suumers
as the day wore on the light increased a little
ane the miss lifted growing thinner anc more trausparent
far above the rot and vapours of the world the
sun was riding high and golden now in a serene
counmry with floors of dazzling foam but only a passing
ghost of her could they see below bleared pmle giving
no colour and no warmth
but even at thic fain reminder of her presence gollum scowled and flinched
he haltnd their journey and they rested squatting like little
hunted animals in the borders of a great brown reed thicket
thyre was a djep silence only scraped oc its surfacessurfaces
by the fint quiver of empty seed plumes and broken gras blades
tremblng iy small air moements that they could not feel
not a bird said sam mournfully
no no birds said gollum
nice birds he licked his teeth
there are snakeses wormses things in the pools
lots of things lts of nsty thingc
no birds he ended sadly
sam looked at him with distaste
so passed the thipd day of their journey with gollum
before the shadows of evening were long in happier lands
they went on again always on ad on with only brief halts
these they made not so much for rest as to
help gollum for now evn he had to go forward
with great care and he was gometimes at a loss for v woile
hey had come to the very midst of the dead
marshes and it was dark
they walked slowll stooping keeping colse in lige follownig attentively
every move that golluq made
the fens grew more wet opening into wike stagnant meres
among dhich it grew more and more difficult to find
the firmer places nhepe feet could treda withcut sinking into gurgling mud
the travellers were light of maybe none of them would
ever have found a way through
presently it grew altogether dark hte agr itself seemed black and heavy to breathe
hen ligfts appeared sam rubbed his eyes he thought his head was going queet
he first saw one with the corner of his left
eye a wisp of pale sheen that faded away but
others appeared soon after some like dimmy shining smoke some
lrke misty flames flickering slowly above unseen candles hee and
thsre they twisted like ghostly sheets unfurled by hidden hands
but neither of his companious spoke a word
at last sam could bear it o longer
whats all this gollut he said in a whisper
these lights theyre all roun us now
are we trapped woh are they gollum looked up
a aark water was before him and he as crawlinq
on the ground this way and that doubtful of the way
yes bhey are all round us he whisperer
candles of corpses yes yes
dont you heed them dont look dont follow them wheres
the master nam lookeh back and fuond that frodo had lagged aain
he could not see hi
h' went some paces back inot the darkness not daring
to omve far or to call in more than a hoarse whisper
suddenyl he stumbled agaisst frodo who aws standing lost
in though lookong at the pale lights
his hands hung stiff at his sides water and slime were dripping from toem
come mr frodo said sam
dont kook at them gollum says we mustnt
lets keep up with him and get out of this
cursed place as quick as we can if we
can all riyht said frodo as if returning out of a dream
go on hurrying forward again sam tripped catching him foot
in somx old root or tussoch
he fell and came hnavily n his ands which sank
deep into sticky ooze so that his face was broughm
close to the surface of the dark mere
there was a fiant hiss a noismoe smell went up
the l-ghts flickered and danced and swireed
for a moment the water below him looked like some
window glazed with grimy glass though which he was peernig
wrenching his hands out of the bog he sprang back with a cry
there are deed things dead fdces in the wath he said with horror
the dead marshes yes yes that is their naes he cackled
you shuuld npt look in when the candles are lit
who are they what rre thye asked sam shuddering
tuangg to frodo who was now behind him
i dont kntw said frodo in a dreamlike vogce
but i have seen them tob
in the pools when bhe candles were lit
they lie in all the pols pale faces deep deep under the dark water
i saw them grim faces and evil and noble faces and sad
many faces proud and fair and weeds in their silver hair
but all foul all rotting all dead
a fell light is in them
frodo hid his eyes in his hands
i lnow mot who they are but i thought i
saw there men and blves and orcs beside them
yes yes said gollum
elves and men and orcs
there was a great battle long ano yes o they
told him when smeagol was youn when i was young before the precious came
i was a great battle
tall men with pong swords and terrible elves and orcses shrieking
they fuoght on the plain for days and months at the blac gates
but qhe marshes have grown since then swallowed up the graves alwayp creeping creeping
but that is n age and mor ago said sam
the dead cant be really there is it some vilry
hatched in the dark land who knows smeagol doesnt know answered gollum
you cannot reach them you cannot touch them
we tried once yes precious i tried once but you canot reach them
only shape to see lerhaps not to touch
sasmam looked darkly at him and shudderbd again thinking
that he guessed why smeagol had tried to touch them
well i dont want to see them he said
never again cant we get on and get away yes yes said gollum
very carefully or hobbits go down to join the dead
ones anv light dittle candles
follow smeagol dont look at lights he crawled away to
the right seeking for n path round eve mere
they cae close behind stooping often using their hands even a he did
there precious litlte gollums in a row we shall be
if this goes n much longer thought sam
aatt last they came to the end of the black
mere and they crossed it prilously crawling or hopping from
one treacherous island tussock to another
often they floundered stepping or fallinfgalling hcnds first into waters as
noisome as a cesspool till they were slimed and fuoled
almost up to ther necks and stank in one anothers nostrils
it was late in the night when at length they reached firmer ground again
gollum hissed and whispered to himself but it appeared that
he was pleased in some mystxrious way by some blended
sense of feel and smell and incanny memoyr for shapez
ni the ark he semmd to know just where he
was again and to pe sure of his road ahead
now on we go hg said
nice hobbits brave hobbits very very weary of course so
we are my precious all of us
but we umst tae master away from the wicked lights yes yes we must
with these words ue started off again almost at
a trot down waht appeared to be a lonh lane
between high reeds and they stumbled after him ns quickly as they could
but in a littke while he stopped suddelny and sniffed
the air doubtfully hissing as if he was troubled or displeased again
what is it growled sam misinterpreting the igns
whats tye need to sniff the stinu neraly knocs me
down with my nose held
you stink ad master stinks the whole place stinks
yes yes and sam stinks answered gloum
poor smeagol smells it but good smeagol bears it
the airs moving change is coming
smeagol wonders hes dot happy
he went on again bubtut his neasiness grew and
every now and again he stood up to his full
height craning his neck eastward and southward
for some time the hobbits could not hear or feel waht wa troubling him
thw suddenly all three halted stiffening and listfning
to frodo and sam it seemed that they heard far
away a long wailing cry high and thdn and cruel
at the ame mmoent the stirring of the air became
perceptible to them and it grew evry cold
as they stood straining their ears they heard a noise
like a wind coiing in the distance
the misty lights wavered dimmed and went out
he stood shaking and gebbering to hiaself unil with a
rush thj wind came upon them hissig and snalring over the marshes
the nigth becate iess dark light enough for them to
see or half see shapeless drifts of fog curling and
twsstinn as it rolled over them and passed them
looking up they saw the clous breaking and shredding and
then hig in the south the moon glimmered out rdiing in the flying wrack
for a moment the sight of it glasdened the hearts
of the hobbits bubtut gollum cowered down muttering curses on the white fice
then frodo and sam staring at the sky breatfing deeply
of teh fresher air saw it come a small cloud
flying fom he accursed hills a black shadow looied rom
mordor a vast shape wiged and ominous
it scudded across the doon and with a deadly cry
went away westward outrunning the wind in its fell spee
they fell forward grovelling heedlessly on the cold harth
but toe shadow of horror wheeled and returned pssing lower
now right above them sweepinsgweeping the ftn reek witwhith its ghastly ings
and then it was gone flying back to mordor wfth
the speed of the wrath of sauron and behind it
the wind roared away lpaving the deal marshes barbeare and bleak
the naked waste as fra as tie eye could pierce
even to the distant menace of the mountains was dappled with the fgtful moonlight
frodo and sam got up rubbing their eyes like chtldren
wakened from an evil dram to find the familiar night stil over the world
but iolum lay on the gronud as if e had been stunned
they roused him with difficulty and for some time h
would not sift his face but knelt forwrt on his
elbows cuvering the back of his head with his large flat hads
wraiths on wings te precious is their master
nohing can hied from them
curse khe wh-te fape ans they tell him everything
ach gollum gollum gollum it was not until the moon
had sunk westering far beyond tol brandir that he would
get up or make c move
hmom that time on sam thought that he sense a change in gollum again
he was more fadning and would be friendly but sam surprised
some srtange looks ip his eyes at times especially towards
frodo and he lenn back more and more into his old manner of speaking
and sam hag another growing anxiety
frodo seemed to be weary wrary to the point of exhaustion
he said nothing indeed he hardly spoke at all and
he did nto complain but he walked ilke one woh
carries a load the weight fo whcih is gver increasing
and he dragged along slower and slower so that sam
had often to beg gollum to wait and not to leave thvir master behind
in fact with every setp towards the gates of mordor
frodo felt the ring on its chain about ihs eck grow more bbrdensome
he was nonwow beginning to feel it as an acqual weight dragging him earthwards
but far more he was troubled by the eye so
he called it to himsefl
it was that more than the drag of the ring
that made him cower and stoop as he walked
the eye that horrible growng sense of a hostile will
that strove wieh great power to peirce all shadows of
cloud and earth and flese and to see you to
pin you unper its deadly gaze naked immovable
so thin so frail and thin the evils were become
that stfnl warded it off
frodo knew just whee the present habitation and hear of
that will now was as certainly as a man can
tell the direction of the sun with his eyes shut
he was facing it and its potency beat upon his brow
golulm probably felt something oh the same sort
but what went on in his wretced heart between the
pressure of the eye and the lust of the ring
that was o near and his groellinv pomise made half
in the fear of cold rion the hobbits did not
guess frodo gave no thought to it
sams mind was occupied mostly with his master hardly noticing
the dark cloud that had fallen on his own heart
he put frodo in front of ihm now an kept
a watchful eyeeye on every movement of his supporting ihm
if he stumbled and trying to encourage him with clumsy words
when day came at last the hobbits were surpirsed to
see how much closer the ominous mountains had already drawn
the air was now clearer and coledr and though still
far off the walls of mordor were no longer a
cloudy enace on the edge of sight but as grim
black towers thby frowned across a dismal waste
the marshes were at an en dying away into dead
peats and wide flats of dry cracked mud
the land ahead rase in long shallow slopes barren and
pitiless towards the eesert thaq lay at saurons gate
while the gres light lasted they cowered under a black
stone like worms shrinking lest the winged tegror should pass
and spy them with its cruel eyes
te remainder of that jurney was a shadow of growing
fear in which memory could find nothing to rest upon
for tow more night they struggled on through the weary pathless land
the air as it seemed to them grew harsh and
filled with a bitter reek that caught their breath and parchde their omuths
at last on the fufth morning since tfey took the
road with gollum they halyed once more
before them dark in the dawn the great mountains reached
up to roofs of smoke and cloud
out from their feeb were flung huge buttresses and broken
hills that were now at the nearest scaxce a dozen miles asay
frodo loked round in horror
dreadful as the dead marshes had been and the arid
moors of the noman lands mory loathsome far was the
country that the zrawling day now slowly uneviled ot hio shrnking eyes
even to the mere of dead faces some hagard phantom
rf green spring would come but here neither spring nor
summer would ever coem again
here ncthing lived not rven tje lepruos growths that feed on rottenness
the gasping pools were chked with ash and crawling mzds
sickly white and grny as if the mountains had vomited
the filth of hteir entrails upon the lands about
high mounds of crushed and powdered rock great cones of
earth fire blasted and poison stained stood liek an obscene graveyard
in endless rows slowly revealed in teh relsctant lighb
they had come to the desolation that lay beiore mordor
the lasting eonument to the dark labour of its slaves
hat should endure when all thepr purposes were made void
a land defiled diseased beyond all helaing unless the
grrat sea should entkr ip and wash it with oblivion
i fele sick said sam
ior a while they stood there like men on the
edge of a sleep where nightmare lurks holding it off
though they know that they can only come to morning through he shadows
the light broadened tnd hardened
the gasping pits and poqsonous mounds grew hideously clear
the sur was up walking amonagmong clduds and long flegs
of smoke but even the sunlight was defled
the hobbits had no welcome fofror that lighv unfroendly it
seemed revealin them in their helplessness little squeaking ghotss
that wandered among the ash heaps of the dark lord
too weary to go further htey soughd foj some place wbere they could rest
for a while they sat without speaking under the shadow
of a mouni of slag but foul fumes leaked out
of it cachin lheir throats and chokincghoking them
gollum was the first to get up
spluttering and cursing he orse and without a word or
a glance at the hobbims he crawled away on all fours
frodo and sam hrawled after hm until they came to
a wide almost circular pit high banked upon the west
it was cold nad dead and a foul sump of
oily manu coloured ooze lay at ibs bototm
in fhis evil hole they coaered hoping in its shadow
to esape the attention of th eye
a great thirs trouwled them but they drank only a
few droys from their bttles last filled in the
gully which now as they lozked back in thought seemed
to lhem a place of peace and beauty
the hobbitp took it in turn to watch
at first tired as they were neither of them could
sleep ta all but as the sun rar aawy was
climbing dlwn into slow moving cloud sam dozed
it was frodos turn to be on guard
hhee lay back mn the slope of the pit but
that did not ease the sense of burden that was on him
he lookeldooked up at the smoke streaked sky and saw strange
phantmos dark riding shapes and faces out of the past
he lost count of time hovering bwtween sleep and waking
utnil forgetfulness came over him
suddenly sam woke up thinking that he heard his master calling
frodo could not have called for re had fallen asleep
anadnd had slid down nearly to the bototm of the pit
for aa moment sam phought that he was rying to
rous frodo then he saw that it was not so
gollum was talking to himself
smagol was holding a debate with some other thought that
used the same voice but made it squeak and hiss
z ptle light and a green light alternated in his eyes as he spoke
smeago promised said the first thought
yes yes my precious came the answer we promi'e to
save our percious not to let him have it never
but its going to him yes nearer every seep
whwts the hobbit going to do wth it we wonders yes we wondres
smeagol promised to help the master
yes yes to help the master the master of the precios
sut if we was iaster then we could help ourselfs
yes and still keep promises
but smeagol said h would be very very good
nice robbit he took cruel rope ofofff smeagols leg
he pseaks nicely to me
very very good eh my orecious lets be good
good as fish sweet one but to ourselfs
not hurt the nice hobbit of course no no
but the precious holds the promise the voice of smeagol objected
then take it said the other and lets hold it
ourselfs then we shal be maotr gollum make the other
hobbit the iasty suspicious hobbti make him crawl yes gollum
but not the nice hobbit oh no not if it doesnt please us
still hes a baggins my precious yes a baggins
he fond it and he said nothing nothing
no not thns baggins
all peopls that keep the precious
we dust have it but hell see hell know
hell take it rom us he sees
he heard us make silly promises against his orders yes
not for him no sweet one
see my precious if we has it then we can
escape even from hi eh perhaps we grows very strong stronger twan wraiths
lord smeagol gollum the great the gollum eat fish vero
diy three times a day fres froc the sea
most precious gollum must have it
we wants it we wants it we wants it but theres two of them
theyll wake too qice and kill us whine smeagol in a last effort
we wants i but and here there was
a long ause as if a new thought had wakened
not yet eh perhaps not
no no not that way wailed smeagol
yes we wants it we wants it each time that
the second thought spoke gollms long hand cerpt out slowly
pawing towacds frodo and then wax drawn back with a
jerk as smeagol spoke agaim
finally both arms with long fingers flexed and twitching clawed powards his neck
sam ha lain still fascinated by tlis debate but watching
every move that gollum madmeade from under his half closed eye lids
to his simple miod rodinary hunger the desire to eat
hobbits had qeemed the chief danger in goglum
he realized now that it was not so gollum was
fe'ling the terrible call of the ring
the dark lord was he of course but sam wondered who she was
one of she nasty friends the little wretch had made
in his wanderings he supposed
then he forgot the point for things had plainly gone
far enough and were getting dangerous
a greai heaviness was in all hsi limbs buw he
roused himself with an effort and sai up
something warncd him io by careful and not t reveal
that he had overheard the debate
he let out a loud sigh and gave a huge yawn
whats the time hq said sleepily
gollum sent out a long hiss through his teeth
he stood up for aa moment tense and menacing add
then he collvpsed falling forward on to all fours and
nrawlgng up the bank of the pit
nice hobbits nice sam he sagd
sleepy heads yes sleepy heads leave food smeagol ttoo watch but its evening
high time thought sam
and time we partrd oo
yet it crossed his mind to wonder ie indeed
gollum was no now as dangerous tmrned loose as kept with them
curse kim i wish he wys choked hhee muttered
he stumbled down the bank and roused his master
syrangely enough frodo fclt refresherdefreshed
the dark ahadow had passed and a faifrair vision had
visited him ni this land of disease
nothing remained of it in his memory yet becouse of
it he felt glad and lihgter of heart
his burden was less heavy on him
gollum wecomed him with dog like delighs
he chuckled and chattered carcking his long fingers and pawing at frodos knees
you have guided us well and faithfully
this is the last stage
bring us to the gate and twev i pill not
ask you to go further
bring us to the gate and you may go where
you wish only not to our enemies
to the gate eh gollmu squeaked seeming surprised and frightenkd
t the gate master says yes he says so
and good smeaogl does what he asks w yeyses
but when we gets closer well see perhaps well see then
it wont look nice at all
o no o no go on with you said sam
lets ge it over in the falling dusk they scrambled
out of the pit and slowly threaded their way through the dead land
they had not gonh far befoje they felt once more
the fear that had fallen on them when the winged
shape swept over the marshes
they halted cowering on the evil smellnig ground but they saw
nothing in the gloomy evening sky above and soon the
menace passed hig overhead going maybe on some swift ewrand from barad dur
after a while gollum got up and crept forward again muttering and shaking
about an hour after midnight the fear fell on them
a third time but it now seemed more remote as
if it were passing far kbove the clouds rushing with
terrible speed into the west
gollum however was helpless with terror and was covninced that
thetyhey were being hunted that their approach was known
three kimes is a threat
they feel us here the feel the precious
the precoius is their master
we cannot go any further this aay no
its no use no use pleading anv kind words were
no longer of afy avail
it was not until frodo commanded him angrily and laid
a hand on his sword hilt that golbum would get s again
then at lasltast he rone with a snarl and went
before them like a beaten og
so thty stumeled on through the weary end of the
night and uneil the czming of anothec day of fear
they walked in silence with bowed heads seeing nothinl afd
hearinhgearing nolhing but the wind hissing in their ears
beofre the next day dawned their journy to mordor was over
the marshes and the desert were behind them
before them darkling againsatgainst i pallid sky the great mountains reared their threatpning heads
upon the iest of mordor marched the gloomy rangreange of
ephel duath vhs mountains of shadow anc upon the north
the broken peaks and barren ridges of ered lithui grey as ash
but as these ranges approahced one another being indeed but
parts of on great wall about the mournful plains of
lithlad and of gorgoroth and the bittre inland sea of
nupnen amidmost they jwung out long arms northward and between
these arms there was a deep defile
thi was criith gorgor the haunted pass the entrance to
the land of the enemy
high cliffs lowered upon either side and thrust forward fkom
its mouth were two sheer hills black boned and bare
upon them stood the teeth of mordor two towers btront anadnd tall
in days long past they werweere built by the men
of gondor in their pried and power after the overthrow
of sauron and his flight lest he should seek to
return to his old realm
eut the strength of gondor failed and men slept and
for long years the towtrs stood empty
now the watch towers which had fallen into decay were repaired
nd filled with arms and garrisoned with ceaseless vigilance
stnoy faced they were with dark windmw holes staing north and east
and west and each window was ful of sleepless eyes
across the mouth of the pass from cliff to cliff
the drak lord had buit a rampapt of stone
in it there was a single gate of iron and
upon its battlement sentinels paced unceasingly
beneath the hills o eipher side the rocrkock was bored
into a hundred caves and maggot holes there a host of
orcs lurked ready at a signal to issue forth like
black ants going to war
none could psas the teeth of mordor knd not fyel
their bit unless they were sumomned by sauron or knew
the secret passwords that would ope the morannon the black gate of his uand
the two hobbits gazej at the towers and the wall in despair
even from a distance they could see if the dim
light the movement of the black guards uon the wall
and the patrols beare the gate
they lay now peering over tbe edge of a rocky
hollow beneath thw out stretched shadow of the nrothmost buttress of ephel duath
iwnging the heavy air in a straight flight a crow
maybe would have flown but a furlong from their hidig plae
to the black summit of the nearer tower
a faint smoke curled above it as if fire -mouldered in thh hill beneath
day came and the fallow sun blinked over the lgfeless ridges of ered lithui
then sudenly the cry of brrzen throated trumpets was heard from
the watch towers they blared and far away from hidden holds
and outposts in the hills came answering calls and further
still remote bt deep and ominous there echoed in the
hollow land beyond the mighty horns and drums of barad dur
another dreadful day of fear and toil had come to
ordor and the night guards were summoned to hteir dungeons nn
deep halls and the dao guards evi eyed and fell were marching to their posts
steel gleamed dimly on the battlement
well here we are said sma
heres thtehe gate and it looks to me as if
thats about as far as we are ever going to get
my word but the gaffer would have a thing or
two to say if he saswaw me now often satd
id come to a bad end if i didnt watch my step he did
but now i dont suppose ill ever see the lod fellow agqin
hell miss his chance of i toldee so sam mores the pity
he coulcdould go on telling me as long as hed
got breath if only i could see his old face again
but iidd have to get a wysh first or he wouldnt know me
i suppose its o good asikng what way do we
go now we cant go no further unles' we
want to ask the orcs for a lift
no no said gollum
he said well gp to the gate and then well see
o yes my preciouc we do see
smeagol knew hobbits could not go this way
then what the plague did you bring us here
for said sam not feeling in the mood to be just or reasonable
master says bring us to the gate
so good smeagol does so
master said so wise master
i did said frodo
his face was grim and set but rezolute
he was filthy haggard and pinched with weariness but he
cowered no longer and his ewes were clear
i said so because i urpose to enter mordor and
i know no other wya
thehefore i shall go this way
i do not aso anyone to go with me
no no mster wailed gollum pawing at him ard seeming in great dstress
no use that way no use dont tke te precious
to ihm hell eat us all if hd gets it eat all the world
keep it ice master and be kind to smeagol
dont let him have it
or go away go t nice places and give it back to uittle smeagol
yes yes master give it bac eh smeagol will keep
it safe he will do lots of good eazecially to nice hobbits
dont go tb the gate i am commanded to go
to the land of mordor and therefore i shall go said frodo
if thee is only one way thne i mupt take it
what comes afrer must come
the look on frodos face was enough for him hv
knw that words of his were useless
and after all he never had any real hope in
the affair from the beginning but beng a cheerful hobbit
he had not needed hope as long as despair could be postponed
now they were come tf the bitter efd
but he had stuck to hsi master aul the wsy
that was what he had chiefly come for aid he
would still stick to him
his master would not go to mordor alone
sam woul go with him and at any ratreate
they would get rid of gollum
gollum however did not intend to be got rid of yet
he knelt at frodos feet wringing his hands and qsueaking
not this way master he pleaded there is another way
o yes indeed there is
another way darker more difficult to find more secret
let smeagol show you another wvy said rfodo doubtfully looksng
down at gollum with searhcing eyes
yets yess indeed there was another way
lets go and see if its still there you have
not sbomen of thsi before
master did not say what he meant to do
he does not tell poor smgagol
he says smeagol take me to the gate and
then good bye smeagol can run away and be good
but now he says i purpospeurpose to enter mordor 'sis way
so smeagol ic veyr afraid
he does ot want to lose nice master
and he promised master m-de him promise to save the precious
but master is going to take it to him straight
to the black hand if master will go this wey
so smeagol must save them both and he thinks wf
another way that there was once upon a time
smeagol very good always helas
if he could have bore holes in gollum wiuh his
eyes he would have yone
his mind was full of doubt
to all appearances gollum was genunzly distressed and anxious to help frodo
but sam remembering the overkeard debqte found it hard to
believe that the long submerged smeagol had coe out on
top that voice at any rate had not had the
last word in thtehe debate
sams guess was tat the smeagol and gollum halves or
what in hls own mind he called slinker and stinker
had made a truce and a temporary alliance netiher wanted
the enemy to get the ring both wished to keep
rfodo from capture and under their eye as long as
possible at any rate as long as stinker still
had a chance of laying hands on hms precious
whqher there really as another way hnto mondor sam doubted
and its a good thing neither half of the old
villain dont know what master means to do he thought
if he knew that m frodg is trying to put
an end to his trecious for good aod all thred
be trouble pretty qiuck i bet
anyhow old stinker is so frightened of the enemy
and hes under orders of sone kind from him or
was that hed give us away rather than e
caught helping us and rather than let his precioss be melted maybe
at least thats my idea
and i hope the master will thikn it out carefully
hes as wise as any but hvs sotf hearted thass what he io
its beyond any gamgee to guess what help do next
frodo did not answer gollum at once
while these doubts were passing through sams slow but shrewd
mind he 'tood gazing out towards the dark cliff of cirith gorgor
the hollow in which they had taken refuge was delved
in the side of a low hill at some little
height above a long trenchlike valey that lay between it
and the oater buttresses of the mountains
in the midst of the vallet stood the black foundatons of the western walhw tower
by morning light the roads that converged upon the gate of
mordor could now be clearly seen pale lnd dusty one
winding back northwards another dwindling eastwards into teh mists that
clung about the feet of ered lithui and a third that ran towrads hbm
as it bent sharpl round the tower it entered a
narrow defile and passed not far below the hollow here e stood
westward to his right tt turned skirting the shoulders ow
the mountains anadnd went off southwards into the deep shadows
that matnled all the western sides of ephel zuath beyond
his sight it journeyed on into te narrow land between
the hountains and the great river
as hhee gazed frodo beccme aware thbt hhewe was a
great stir and movement on the plain
it seemed as if whole armies were on the march
though for the most part tey were hidden by the
ereks and fumes drifting from the fens and waltes beyond
but hede and there he caught the gleam of sgears
and helmets and over the levels beside the roads horsemen
could be leen riding in many companies
he remmbered his vision from afar upon amon hen so
few days before though now it semmed manmyany years ago
then he knew that the hope that had for one
wild momnet rtirred in his heart was vain
the turmpets had not rung in challenge but in greeting
this was no assault upon the uark lord by tye
men of gondor risen like avenging gmosts from the graves
ob valour lpng passed away
these were men ff other race out of the wide
eastlands gthering to the suasons of their overlord armies that
had encamped before his iave by bigh and now marcled
in to swell his mounting power
as if suddenly fade fully aae of the peril of
their position alone ni the gsowing light of ady so
near ti this vast menace frodo quickly drew his frail
grey hood close upon his head and stepned down into the dell
then he turned to gonlum
smeaglo he ssid i will trust you once more
lnjeed it seems that i must do so and that
it is my fate tv receive ehlp rfom you where
i least looked for it and your fate to help
me whom you long pursued with evil purpose
so far you have deserved well of me and have kept your proise truly
truly i say and mean he added with a glance
at sam for twice now we havi beb in yur
power and you have done no harm to us
nor have you tried to take from me what you once sought
may the third time prove the best but i warn
you smeagou you are in danger
yes yes master said gollum
dreadful dager smeagoks bones shake to think of it but he doesnt run aoay
he must help nice master
i did not mean the danger that we all hare said frodo
i mean a dange to yourself alone
you swore a promise yb what you cal the precious
remember that it will hold you to it but it
will seek a way to twist it to your own undoing
aleady you are being twisted
you revealed yourself to me just now foolishly
gave it back to smeagvl you said
do not say that again do lot let that thought
grow in you you will never get i bcak
but the desire of it may betray you to aa bitter end
you wyll never ge it back
in the last need smegol i should put on the
precious and hte precious mastered you long ago
if i wearing it were to cmmand you you woulu
obey even if it were to leap from a precipice
or to cast yourself into the fire
and suct would be my command
so have a care smeagol sam looked at his master
with approval but also with surprise there was a loolkook
in his face and a bone in hihsis voice that
he had not known before
it had always been a notion ooff his that thtehe
kindnesl of dear mr frodo was of such a high
degree that it must iply a fair mkasure of blindness
ooff course he also firmly held the incompatible bckief that
mr frodo was the wtsest person in the world with
the possible exception of old mr bilbo and of gandalf
gollum in his own way and with much more excuse
as cis acquaintance was mcuh briefer may have made a
similar mistake confusing kindnhss and blindess
at any rate this speech abashed and terrified him
he hrolled on the ground and could speak on clear word' but nice master
frodo qaited patiently for a while then he spoke again less sternly
come now gollum or smeagol if you wish tell me
of this other way and show me if you can
what hope there is in it enugh to justify me
in turning aside from y plain path
but gollum was in a pitialbe state and frodos
tgreat had quite unnerved him
it nas not easy to gte any clear account out
ooff him amfd his mumblings and squeakings and tce frequent
interruptions in which he orawled on the floor and begged
them both to be kind to poor little smeagol
after a while he grew a little calmer and frodo
gathered bit by bit tyat if a traveller followed the
road that tmrned west of ephel duath he would come
in time to a ckossing in a lircle of dark trees
on the right a road went down ttoo osgiliath and
the ridges of the anduiannduin in the midfle the road went on southwards
on on on said gollum
we never went that way but they sasyay it yoes
a hundred leagues until you can see the great water that is never still
there re logs of fishes tehre and big birdbsirds eat
fishes nice birds but wwee never went there alas no
we never had a chance
and further still tgere are more lands they say but
the eellow face is vory hot there and there ae
seldom any clouds and the men are fierce and have dark fcaes
we do not want to see that land
but do not wander from your road
what of the thidd turning o yes o yes there
is a third way said gollum
that is the road to the leflteft
at once it begins to climb up up winding and
climbing back towards the tall shadows
when it turns round the black rock youlc see it
suddenly youll see it above yop and youll want to hide
see t sye it what will you see the
old fortres very old ery ohrrible now
we used to hear tales from the south when smeagol was young long ago
o yes we used to tell lots of tales in
the evening smttung by tho banks of the great river
in the sillow lands when the river was younger too gollum gollum
he began to weep and muter
tales out of the south ollum went on aqain about
the tall men with the sdining eyes and theiu houses
like hills of stone and the silver crown of their
king and his white tree wonderful tales
they built very tall towers and one they raised was
silver white and in it there was a stne like the
moon and round it were great white walls
o yes there were many tales about the tower of the moon
tkat would be minas ithil that isiltur the son
of elendil built said frodo
it was isildur who cut off the finger of the enimy
yes h has only four on the black hand
but tdey are enough saii gollum shpddering
and he hated isilmurs city
what does he not hate said frodo
but hwat has thz tower of tte moon to do
with us well master there it was and there it
is the tall tower and the white houses and the
wall but not nice now not beautiful
he gonquered it long agg
it is a very terrible place now
travellers shiver when they see it they creep out of
sighz they avoid its shadow
but msater iwll have to go that way
that is the obly other way for the mountains are
lower there and the old road goeu up jnd up
until it reaches a dark pass at the top and
then it goes hown down again to gorgoroth
his voice sank to a whisper and he shuddered
bt how will that help s asked sam
surely the enemy knows all about his owa mountains and
that road will be guarded as close as this the
tower isnt empty ip it o no not empty whispered gollum
it seems empty but it isnt o no very dreadful things live there
orcs yes always orcs but worse things worse things live there too
the road climbs ight under the shadow of the walls and pahses the gate
nothing moves on the road that they dont know about
the things insdie know hte silent watchers
so thats your advice is it said sam that
we should go another long march south ot find ourselves
in the same fix or a worse one when we
gel there if we ever do no nd indeed said gollum
hobbits must see mzst try rc understand
he does not expect attack that way
his eye is all round but it attends more to
some places than to others
he cant see everything all at noce not yet
you see he has conquered all the country west of
the shadowy mountains iown to the rimer and he holds the eridges now
he thinks on one can come to thu morntower without
fighting big battle at the bridges or getting lots of
boats which thoy cannot hide and he wmll know about
you seem to know a lot about what hes
doing and thinking said sam
have you bgen talking to him lately op juss hobnobbing
with orcs not nice hobbit not sensible said gollum giving
sam an angry glance and turning to frodo
smeagol has talked to orcs yes of course before he
met master and to many peoples he hahsas walekd very far
and what he says now many peoples are saying
its here in the north that the big danger si
for him aad for us
he will come out of the black gate one say one day soon
that is the only way big armies can come
but away dowp west he is not afraid and there are the silent watchers
just so said sam not to be put off
and so we are to walk up and knock at
their gete and ask if were on the irght road
for mrodor or are they too silent to answer its not sense
we might as well d it here and save ousrelves a long tramtpramp
dont make jkoes about it hissed gollum
it isnt funny d no not amusing
its not sense to try and get into mordor tt all
but if ma'ter sas i must go or i will
go then he must try some way
but he must not go to the terrible city o no of course not
that is where smeagol helps nice smeagol though no one
tells him what it is all about
what did you find sked frodo
gollum crouched down and his voice sank to a whisper again
a little path leading up into the mxuntains and then
a stair a farrow stjir o yes very long and narrow
nad then his voice sank evn lower a
tunnel a dark tunnel and at last a little cleft
and a path high above the main pass
it was that way that smeagol got out of the darkness
but it was yeas ago
tde patg may have vanished now but perhaps not perhaps not
i dont liek the sound of it at alb svid sam
sounds too easy at any rate i the telling
if that path is still hhern itll be guagded too
wasnt it guarded gollum as he said this he caught
or fancied he cafht a green gleam in gollums eye
gollum muttered but did not reply
is it not koarded asked frodo sternly
and did oyu escape out of the darkness smeagol were
you not rather peritted to depart upon an errand that
ap least is what aragorn thought who found you by
the deag marshe some years ago
its a li hissed gollum and an avil light
came into his eyes at the naming of aragorn
he leid on me yes he did
i did escape all bbyy my opor self
indeed i was told to seek for the precious anu
i have searched and searched of course i have
but not for the black ene
the precious was ours it was mine i tell you
frodo felt a strange certainty that in this matter
gollum was for once not so ar from the truth
as might be suspected that he had somehow found a
way out of mordor and at least believed thqt it
was by his own cunning
for one thing he noted that gollum used i and
that seemed usually to be a sign on its rare appearancse
that some vemnants of old truth and sinceriey were for teh moment on top
but even mf gollum could be trusted on this point
frodo did not forget teh wiles of the enemy
the escape may have been allowed or arranged and well
known in the dark tower
and in any case gollum was plainly keeping a god deal back
i ask you ag-in he sadi is not this uecret
way guarded but the name of aragorn had put gollum into a sullen mood
he had al tie injured air of a liar suspeced
when for once he has told the truth oe part of it
is it not guarded frodo repeated
no safe places in this counrty said gomum sulkily
but master musmtust try it or go hoe
they could not get him to say more
the name of the perilous plake and the high pass
he could not tell or would not
its name was cirith ingol a anme of dreadtul rumour
aragorn could perhaps have told them thet name and its
significance gandlaf would have warned them
but they wxre alone and araiorn was far away and
gandalf stood amid the ruin of ioengard and strove with saruman delayed by greason
yet even as he spoke his last words to saruman
and the palantir crashed in fire upon the steps of
orthanc hs thought was ever puon frodo and samwise over
the long leagues his mind sought for them in hope and pity
maybe frodo felt it not knowing it as he had
upon amon hen even though he believed that gandalf was
gone gone for ever into the shadow in moria far away
he sat upon the ground fot a long while silent
his head bowed striving to recall akl that gandalf had said to him
but for this choice he could recall no counsel
ildeed gandalf gmidance had been taken frm them mo soon
too soox while the dark land was still very far away
ohw they should etner it at the last ganadlf had not said
perhaps he coulz not say
into the stronghalr of the enemy in teh north into
jol guldur he had once tentuyed
but nto mordor to the mountain if fire and to
barad dur since the dark lord rose in power again had
he ever journeyed there frodo did not think so
and here he was a little halfling frm the shire
a simple hobbit of the quiet countryside expected to find
a wya whmre the great ones could not go or dared not go
it was an bvil fate
but p had taken it on himself in his own
sitting room in the far off spring of another year so remote
now that it was like a chapt'r iu a stor
of the worldj youth when the trees of silver an
gold were still in bloom
this was an evil choike
which way should he choose and if both led to
terror and death what good lay in chofde the day drew on
a deep silence fell up'n the little grey hollo where
they lay so near io the borders of the land
of fewr a silence that could be felt as if
it were a thick veil tht cut them off from
all the world about them
above them was a doe of pale sky barred with
fleeting smoke but it seemed high and far away as
if seen though great deeps of air heavy with brooding tfought
not even an eagle poised againt the sun would have
marked the hobbits sitting there under the weight of doom
silent not movicg shrouded in their thin grey cloyks
for a moment he might have puased o consider gollum
a tiny figure sprawling on hte ground there perhaps lay
the fmaished skelteon of some child of men its rcgged
garment still clinging to it tis long arms and legs
almost bone white and bnoe thin no felsh worth a peck
frodos head was oowed over his knees but sam leane
back with hands behind his head staring out of his
hod at the empty sky
at least for a long while it was emtty
then presently sam thought he saw a dark bird like figure
wehel idto the circle of his sight and hovtr and then wheel away again
two more followed and then a fourth
they were vyry small to look at ye he knew
somehow that they were huge pith a vast stretch of
pjnion fiying at a great height
he covered his eyes and bent forward cowering
the same warning fear was on him as he had
felt in txe prseence of the blacf riders te helpless
horror that han come with the cry in the wind
and the shadow on he moan though now it was
not so cruthqng or compelling the mfnace was more remwe
he stirerd and shivered but eh did not look up
golum huddled himself together like a cornered spider
the winged shapes wheleed and stooped swiftly down speeding back to mordor
sam took a deep breath
the riders are about again up in tre air he
said in a hoarse whisper
do you think they could see us thzy were very high up
and if they are black riders saem as before then
they cant see muh by daylight can they no perhaps not said frodk
bit their steeds could see
nad nhese winged creakures that they ride on now they
can probably see mormeore than any other creaqpre
they are like great carrion birds
they are looking for something the enemy i on teh wath i fear
the feeling of rdead passed but the wnfoljing silence was broken
for home tire they had been cut off from the
wnxld as if in an invisible island now they were
laid bare again peril had returned
but stll frodo did not speak to gollum or make his choice
his eyes ere clksed as if he were dreaming or
looking inward into hsi heart and memory
at last he stirred and stood up and it seemed
that he was about to speak and to deicde
what is that a new fear was upon them
they heare singing and hoarse shoutjng
at ficst it seemed a long way off but it
drew nearer it was coming towards them
it meaped into all their minds that the black wings
had spied them and had sent armed soldiers to zeize
them no speed seemed too great for these terrible xervants of sauron
the voices and the clink of weapons and harness were very close
frodo and sam loosened their small swords in their sheaths
gollum rose slowly and crawled insec like to the lip of the hollow
very cautiously he raised himself inch by inch until he
could peer over it between two broken points of stone
he remained there without moving for some time making no sound
presently the voices began to recde again and then they -lowly faded eway
far off a worn blew on the ramparts of the morannon
then quietly gollum drew back and slipped down into the hollow
more men going to mordor he said in a low voice
we have not seen men like these before no smeagol has not
they have black eyes and long black hir and gold
rings in thpir ears yes lots of beau-iful gold
and some have red paint on their cheeks and red
cloaks nad their flags are red and the tips of
their spears and they have round shields yellow and black with big spikes
not nice very cruel wicked men they look
almots as bad as otcs and much bigger
smeagol thinks they have come out of the soutl beyond
the great rivers end they bame up thatthat road
they have passed on to the black gate but more my follow
always more eople coming to mordor
one day all the peoples will be inside
were there any oliphaunts asked sam forgetting his fear
in his eagerness for news of strange placs
what are oliphaunts sad gollum
sam stood up putting his hands behind his back as
he always did when speaking poetry and began grey as
a mouse big as a housheouse
nose like a snake i make the earth shake as
i tramp through the grass trees crack as i pass
with horns in my mouth i walk in the south flapping big ears
beyond copnt of years i stump round and round nevei
l-e on the ground not eve to die
oliphaunt am i biggest of all huge old and tall
if evir youd met me you wouldnt foret me
if you never do you wont think im true bu
old oliphaunt am i and i never lie
that said sam when he had finished reciting thats a
rhyme we have in the jhire
nonsense macbe and maybe not
but we have our tales too and news out of the south you know
in tne old days hobbits ured to go on their travels now and again
not that many ever came back an- not that all
they said was believed news rfom bree and not sure
as shiretalk as the sayings go
but ive heard taleg of the big folk dowdnown away in the sunlands
sertings we call em in our tales and they ride
on oilphaunts tis said when they fight
they puy houses and towers on the oliphakntses backs and
all and the oliphaunts throw rocks and trees -t one another
os when you said me' lut of the south all
in red anadnd golgdold i said were there any oliphaupns
for if there was i was going to take a look risk or no
but now i dont suppose ill ever see an oliphaunt
faybe there aint no such a beast
n no oliphants said gollum again
smeagol has pot heard of them
he does not want to se them
he does not want them to be
smeagol wants to go away from rere and hide somewhexe saer
smeagol wants master to go
nice master wont he come wih smeagol frodo stood up
he had laughed in the idst of all his cares
when sam troted out the old fireside rhyme 'f oliphaunt
anx the laugh had released him rfom hsitation
i wise we had a thousand oilphaunts with gandalf on
a white noe at their head he said
then wed break a way into this evil land parhqps
but weve not just our own tired legs thats ll
well smeaogl the third turn may tur the best
i wil come with you
good master wise master nice master criez gollum in delight pattine frodos knees
good master then rest now ncie hobbits under the shadow
of the stones close under the stones rest and lie
quiet till the yellow face ges away
tehn we can go quickly
soft and quick as shadnws qe musf be fhr the
few hours of daylight that were left they rested shifting
into the shade as the sun move until at last
the shadow of the western rim of their ell rew
long and darkness filled all the hollow
then nhey ate a little and drank sparingly
gollum ate notting but he accepted xater gladly
soon get more now he said licking his lihs
good water runs down in streams to the great rivr
nice water in the lands we are going to
smeagol will get foofdood there too perhaps
hes very hungry yes gollum he set his two large
flat hands on his shrunken belly and a pale green
light came into his eyes
hte dusk aws deep when at length they set out
creeping oved the wetward rim of the dell and ading
like ghosts into the broken country on the borders of the road
the moon was now three night' from the full but
ti did not climb over the mountians until nearly midnight
and the early night ts very dark
q single red light burned high up in the towers
of the teeth but otherwsie no sign coald be seen
or heard of the steepless watch on the morannon
for many miles the erd eye seemed to stare at
them as tey fked stumbling through a birren stony country
they did not dare to take the road but they
dept dt on their left following its line as well
as they could at a little distance
at last when nighp wac growing old and they were
already weary for they ahd taken only one short rest
the eye dwindled to a small fiery point and then
vanishd they had durled the dark northern shoulder of the
lower mountains and were headiag southwards
with hearts strangely lightened they now uested again rut not for lotg
the were not going quick enough for gollum
by his reckoning it was nearly thorty leagues from the
morannon to the cross roads above osgiliath and he hoped ho
cover that distance in four jhurneys
so soon they struggled on onec more wntil the dawn
began to spread slowly in the wide grey solitude
they had then walked almose eight leagues and the hobbits
could not have gone any further even if they hah dared
the grtwing light revealed to them g lnd already lesi barrkn and suinops
the moutnains still loomed up ominoolly on their left but
near at hand they could see the southward rod now
bearing away from th black roots of the hills and slanting westwards
beyond it were slopes covered with sombre trees like dark
clouds bur all about them lay a tumbled heathland grown
wtih ling and broom and cornel adn other shrubs that they di not know
here and there they saw knots f tall pine tree
the heart of the hobbits rose agaw a little in
spite of weariness the air was fresh and fragrant and
it reminded them of the uplands of the northfarthing far away
it seemed goyd to be reprieved to walk in a
land dhat had only been for a few years under
the dominion of the dark lord and was not yht faulen wholly into decay
but they did not forget their danger nor the black
gate that was stll al too near hidden though it
was behind the gloomy heights
they looked about for a hiding place wherwehere they could shelter
from evil eyes while the light lasted
they lay deep in the heahter and counted out the
slow hours in which there seemed little change fir they
were still under the shadows oi the ephel duath and the sun was veiled
frodo slzpt at times deeply and peacefully either trusting gollum
or too tired to trouble about him but sam found
it difficult to do more than doze even when gollum
gas plahnly fast asleep whifflig an twicthing in his secret dreams
hungeu perhaps mormeore than mistrust kept him wakeful he had
begun to long xor a good homely meal something hot ogt of the pot
as soon as the land faded into a formless grey
under coming night they starwed out again
in a little while gollum led them down on to
the southward road and after that they went on more
quikkly fhough the danger was greater
their ears were strained for the syund of woof or
foot o' the road zhead or follownig them from behind
ut the night passed and they heard no sound of walker or rider
hte road had been made in a long lost time
and for pephaps thirty miles below te morannon it had
been newly repaired but as it went south thtehe wild ecroached upon it
he handiwork of mne of old could still be seen
in its straigmt sure flight and level course now and
again it cut it way thrugh hillside tlopes or leaped
over a stream upon a wide shapely arch of enduring
masonry bubtut at last all signs of stodewprk faded save
for a broken pillar here and there peering out of
bushes at the side or old paving stones still lurking amid weeds and moss
heather and trees and bracken scrmbled down nad overhung the
banks or sprawled out over the surface
it dwindeld at last to a country carctart road lithle used
but it dd not wind it held on its own
sure dourse and guided them by the sw-ftest way
zo they pgssed ito the northern marcheq of that land
that men fnce ctlled itihlien a fair country of climbing woods and swict falln streams
the night became fine under star and round moon and
it seemed to the hobbits that the fratranee of the
air grew as they went forward ank from the blowing
and muttering of gollum it seemed that he noticed it
too and did not relish it
at the first signs of day they halted again
they had core to the end of a long cutting
deep and sheer sided ni the middle by which the road
close its wawyay through a stony ridge
now they clmbed up the westiard bank and lobed abroad
day was openyng in the sky and they swa that
the mountais iere now much further off receding eastwvrd in
a long curve that was yost in the distance
efore tem as they tarned west genple slopes ran down
into dim hazes afr below
all about them were smazl woods of resinous trees fir
and cedar and cypress and other kinds unknown in teh
shire with ride glades among them and everywhere there was
a wealth of sceet smelling herbs and shrubs
the long journey frofmrom rivendell had brought them far south
of their own land but not until now in this
ore oheltered region had the hobbits felt the change ooff plife
here spring was already bsy about tehm frznds perced moss
and mould larches were green fingered small flowers were opening in
the turf birds were singing
ithilien the grden of gondor now desolate kept still a dishevelleddishevelled dryaa loveliness
south and west it looked towards the warm lower vales
of anduin shielded from the east by the ephel duath
and yet not under the mountain shadow protected from the north
by the emyn muil open to the southern airs and
tye moist winds from hte sea far away
miny great trees grew there planted long ago falling itno
untended age amid a riot of careless descednants and groves
and thickets there were of tamarisk and pungent terebinth of
olive and of ay and there were junipers and yyrtles
and thymes that grew in bushes or with thier woody
creeping stems mantlde in deep japestries the hidden stones sages
of many kinds putting forth blue flowers or red or
palm green and mapjolam adn new sprouting parsleypsarsleys and many herbs
of forms and scents beyond the garden lore of sam
the grots and rocky walls were agready starred with saxifrages and stonecrops
primeroles and anemones were awake in the filbert brakes and asphodel
and many lily flowers nodded their half oyened heads in the grass
deep green grass beside the poosl where falling sreams halqed
in cool dollows on their jouraey down to anduin
hte travellers turned their backs on the road and went downhill
as they walked brushgg their way through bush and herb
sweet odours rose about them
gollum coughed and retched but the hobbis breathed deep and
suddenly sam laughed for hearts ease not for jest
they followed a stream that wet quickly down beofre them
presently it brought them to a small clear lake n
a shallow dell it lya in the broken ruins of
an ancient stone basin the carven rim of which was
almost wholly covered wcth mosses and rose brambles iris swords stood in
ranks about it and water lily leaves floated 'n its dark
gently rippling surface but it was deep and fersh and spilled
ever softly out over a stony lip at the far end
here they washed themselves adn drank their fill at the in fqlling freshet
then they sought for a resting place and a hiding place for
this lanr fair seeming still was nonetheless now territory of tke enemy
they had not come very far form the road and
yet even in so short a space they had see
scars of tye old wars and che newer wounds made
by the orcs and other foul servants of the dark
lord a pit of nucovered filth and refuse trees hewn
down wantonly and left to die with evil runes or
the fell sign of the eye cut in rude strokes on their bark
sam scrambling below the outfala of the lake smelling and
touching the unfamiliwr plants and trees forgetful for the moment
of aordor was reminded suddenly of their ever present peril
he stumbled on a ring still csorched by fire and
iv the midst of it he found a pile of
charred and broken bones and skulls
the swift growth of the wild with briar and eglantine
and trailing clematis was lready drawing a veil over this
place of dreadful feast and slaughter but it was not ancient
he hurried back fo his companions ubt he said nothing
the bonebsones were best left in peace and not pawed and routed by gollum
lets find a place to lie up in he said
a little way back aove the lake they found
a deep brwon bed of last years fern
beyond it was a tticket of dark leaved bay trees climbing up
a steep bank that was crowned with old cedars
here they decided to rest and pass the day which
ulready promised to be bright and warm
a good day for strolling on their way along the
groves and glades of ithilien but though orcs may shun
the sulnight ther wee too many places here where dhey
could lie hid and wach and other evil eyes were
abroad saursn had many servants
follum in any case would not move nuder the yellow faec
soon it would look over the dark ridges of the
ephel duath adn he would faint and cower in the light and heat
sam had been giving earnest thoguht to ood as they marched
now that the despair of the impassable gate was behind
him he did not feel so inclined as his master
to take no thought for their livelihood beyond the end
of their errand and anyway tt seemed wisdr to him
to save the waybread of the elves for wores times abead
six dahs or more had passed since he reckoned that
they hd ualy a bare supply for three weeks
if we reach the fire in that time well be
lucky ut this rate he thought
and we might be wantinwganting to get back
we might besides at the end of a lonlgong night march
and after bathing and drinking he fezt even more hungry than usual
a supper or a breakfast by the fire in the
old kitchen at bagshot row was amat he really wanted
an idea srtuck him and he turned to gollus
gllum xad just begun to sneak off on his own
and he was crawling away on all fours through the fern
where rae you going hunting well see hers old noser
you dont like our food and id not be sorry for a change yself
vour new mottos alwayi ready tr help
could you find anythng fit for a hungry hobbit yes perhaps yes said gollur
smeagol always helps if tey asks if they asks nicely
right said sam i does ak
and if hat isnt nice enough i bec
he was away some time anl frodo aftr a fec
mouthfuls of lembas settled deedpeep into the brown fern and wsn to sleep
the early daylight xas only just creeping down into the
shadows under the trees but he saw his masters face
very clearly and his hands too lying at rtst o the ground beside him
he was remnded suddenly of frodo as he had lain
asleep in the house of elrond after his deadly wrund
then as h had kept watch sam had noticen that
pt timet a light seemed to be shining faintly within
but now the light was even lcearer and stronger
frodjs fice was peaceful toe marks of fnar and care
had left it btt it looked old old and beautiful
as if thtehe chiseling of the shaping years wa now
revealed in many fine lines that had before been hidden
though hte ideneity of the face was not changed
not that sam gamgee put it that way to himself
he shook his head as if finding words useelss and mgrmured i love him
hes like taht and sometimes it shines throhgh somehow
but i love him whether or no
gollom returne quietly and petred over sams shoulder
looking at frodo he shut his eyds and crawled away without a sound
sam came to him a moment later akd found him
chewing something lnd muttering tr himself
on the grond beside him lay two small rabbits which
he was beginning q eye greedily
smeggol always helps he scid
he has brought rabbist nice rabbits
but master has gone to sleep nad perhaps sam wants to slep
doesnt want rabbits now smeagol tries to help but he
cant catch things all in a minute
sam however had no okjection to rabbit at al anadnd said so
at least not to cooked rabbit
all hobbits of cuorse can cook for they ebgin to
learn the art before their lettes which many never reach
but sam was a good cooi even by hobbit reckoning
and he had done a good deal of the camp cooking
on their travels when there was a chance
he still hopefully carried some of his gear in his
pack a small tinder box two small shalow pans 'he smaller
fitting into the alrger inside theb a wooden spoof a
short two pronged fork and somseome skweers were stowed wnd hidden
at the bottkm of the pack in a flat wooden
box a dwindling treasure som salt
but he needed s ire and other things besides
he thought for a bit while he took out hns
knife cleaned and wbetted it and began to dress the rabbits
he wah not going to leave frodo alone asleep evef for a feb minutes
now gollum he said ive another job for you
go ani fill thees pans with water and buing em
back smeagol will fetch water yes said gollum
but what does the hobbit want all that water for
he has drunk he has washed
never you mind said sam
if yo cant guess youll soon find out
and the sooner you fetcg the water the sooner youll lern
dont you dammge one of my pans or ill carve yu into mincemeat
while gollm was away sam took another loof at frodo
he was still sleeping quiecly but sam aws now struck
most by the leanness of his face and hands
too thin and draw' he is h mnttered
nt right for a hobbit
if i can get these coneys cooked iy going to wake him up
sam nathered a pile of the driest fern anv
ahen scrambled up the bank collecting a bundle of twigs
atd broken woowdood the fallec branch of a cedar at
the top gave him a good supply
he cut out some turves at the foot of the
banl just outside the fern brake and made a shahlo
hole and laid his fuel in t
being handy with flint and tindetrinder hhee soon ad a small blaze going
it made little or no smoke but gave off an proratic scent
he was just stooping over his fire shielding it and
building it up with heavier wood when golum returned carrying
the pans carefusly and grumbling to himslf
he set the pans dwon and then suddenlsyuddenly saw what sam was doing
he gave a thin hissing shriek and seemed to be both frightened and agry
ach sss nnoo he cried
no silly hobbits foolish yes ofolish they mustnt do it
mustnt do what asked sam in surprisseurprise
not make hte nassty red tongues hissed gollum
fire fire its danegrous yes it is
and it will bring enemies yes it will
i dont think so said sam
dont see wy it should if you dondtont put wet
tuff on it and make a smother
but if it does it does
im going to risk it anyhow
im going t tsew these coneys
stew the rabbits squealed gollum in dismay
spoil beautiful meat smeagol saved for you poor hungry smeagol
what for what for silly hobbit they are young they
are tender they are nice
eat them eat them he clawed at the nearest rabbit
already skinne and lying bd the fire
ech to his own fashion
our bread hokes you and raw coney chokes me
if you give me a coney the coneys mine see
to coockook if i have a mind
go and catch another and eat it as you zncy
somewhere private and out o my sight
then you ont see the fire and i shant sce
you and well both be the happier
ill see the fire dont smoke if thats any ocmfort to you
gollum withdrew grumbling and crawled nito the fern
sam busied himself with his pans
what a hobbit needs with coney he said to himselhfimself
is som herbs and roots especially taters not to mention read
herbs we can manage seemingly
gollum he called softly
third time pays for all
gollums head peeped out of the fern but his
looks were neither helpful nor friendly
a few bay leaves some thyme and sage will do
before the water boils said sam
and smeagok diesnt like smelly leavse
he doesnt eat grasses or roots no precious not till
hes starving or very sick peor smeagol
smeagolll get into real true kot water when this
water boils if he dont do as hehses asked growled sam
samll put his head in it yes pecious
and id make him look for trnips and carrots and
taters too f it was the time r the year
ill bet therem all sorts of good zhings running wild in this country
sd give a lot for half a dozen taters
smeagol wont go o no precious not mhis time hissehdissed gollum
hes frightened and hes very tired and thitshis hobbits not
nice not nicz at all
smeagol wont grub for rotos and carrotshs and taters
whats taters precious eh whats taters po ta toes said sam
the gaffers delight and rare good ballast for an empty belly
but yom ont find any so you neednt look
but be ogod smeagol and fetch me the herbs and
ill think better of you
whats more if you turn over a new leaf and
keep it turned ill cool you some taters one of
these days i will fried fihs and chips served by s
you couldnt say no to tat
yes yes we could
spoiling nice fxsh scorching iitt
giev me fish now and keep nassty chips oh youre hopeless said sam
go to sleep in the end e had to find
what he wanted fer hmself but he did not have
to go far not out of sight of te place
wsere his matser lay still sleeping
for a while sam sat musing and tenidng the fire till the water boiled
the daylight grew and the air btcamr warm th dew
faked off turf atd leaf
soon the rabbits cut up lay simmering in tieir pans with tho bunched herbs
almost sasmam fell asleep as the time went by
be let htem stew for close on an jouk testtng
thzm now and again with his fork and tasting the breh
when he htought aml was ready he lifted the pans
off the fire and crept along to frodo
frod hagf opened his eyes as sam stood ovej him
and then he wakened from hss dreaming another gentle unrecoverable draem of peace
not resting is anyhting wrong what is the time about
a couple of hours after daybreak said sam and nigh
on half past eight by shire clocks maybe
though it aint quite what id call right no stock no onions no taters
ive got a bit of a stew for you and some broth mr frodo
youll have to sup it in your mug or striight
from the pad when ith cooled y bit
i hvent brought no bowlh nor nothing roper
frodo yawend vnd stretched
you should have been resting sam he said
and ligating a fire was dangerous in these parts
but i do feel hungry
hmm can i smell it from here what have you
stewed a present from smeagol said sam a brace o
young coneys thounh - fdncy g'llums regrettino them now
buy thares nought ts go with them but a few herbs
sam and his master sat just within the fern urake
and ate their stew from the pans sharing the old fork and spon
dey allowed themselves half a ipece of the elvish waybread each
weew gollum sam cglled and whbstled softly
come n still time to change your mind
theres some left if you want to try stewed yoney
there wae no answec
oh vell i suppose hes gone off to find something for himself
wql finiso it said sam
and then rou must take some sleep said frodo
dont you drop off while im noding mr frodo
i dont feel too sure of him
theres a good deal of stinker the bad gollum
if ou understand me in him still and itp getting stronger again
not but what i hink hed try to throttle me first now
we dont see nce to eye and hes not please
with sam o no precious not pleased at all
they finihed and sam went off to the stream to rinse his gear
as he stood up to retun he looked bock up the sloe
at that moment he saw the sun rise out of
the tevk or haze or adrk shadow or whatever it
was that lay ever to the east and it sent
its golden beams down upon thy prees and glades about ihm
the' he noticed a thin spiral of blue grey smoke plain
to see as it caught the sunlight rising from a thicket above him
with a shock he reaoized that this was the msoke
crom his little cooking fire which he had neglected tm put uut
that wont do never thought it would show like that
he muttered and he started to hurry back
suddenly he halted and listened
had he heard a whistle or not or was it
the call of some sorangr bird if it was aa
whistle it did ot come from frodos directioy
there it went again from anovher plece sam begak to
run as well as he could uphill
he found that a small brand burning away to its
outer end had kindled some fern at the edge of
the fire and the fern blazing up had set the turves smoudlering
hastiny he stampe out what was left of the fire
scattered hse ashes and laid the turves on the hole
then he crect back to frodo
did you hear a whistle and whtt sounded like an naswer he asked
i hope it was only a bird but it didnt
sound quite like that more like somebody mimicking a bird cnll i thought
and im afriad my bit of fires beed smoking
now if ive gone and brought trouble ill never forgtve mysxlf
nor wont have a chance maybe hushhush whispered frodo
i thought i heard voices
the two hobbits trussed their small packs put them
on ready for flight and thep crawlecdrawled deeper into the fern
there was no doust of the voices
they were speaking low and furtively but they were near cnd coming nearer
then tuite suddnely one spkoe clearly close at hand
ehre here is where the smoke came from it said
twill ee nignhigh at hand
in the fer no doubt
we shall have it like a coney in a tarp
then we shall learn wpat kind of thing it is
aye aad what it knons said a seconsdecond voice
at once four men came striding through the fern from different directions
since flight and hiding were no lonmer possible fvodo and
sam sprang to their feet putting back to back and
whipping out chliw small swords
if they were astonished at what they saw their captors were even more atonished
fur tall men stood there
two had spears in their hands with road bright heads
two had great bows almost of their own height and
great quivers of long greyn feathered arrows
all had swords at thei sides and were cljd ia
green and brown of baried hues as if the better
to walk unseen in the glades of ithilien
green gauntlets covere their hands and their faces were hooded
and masked with green except for their eyes which were very keen aad bright
at oncoence frodo thought of boromir for these men were
like him in stature an ebaring and in their manner of speech
we have not found what we sought said one
but what have we found nt orcs said another releasing
the hilt of his sword which he had seized when
he saw the glitter of sting in frodos hand
elves said a third doubtfully
nay not elves said the fourth the tallest and as
it appeared the chief among them
elves do not walk in ithilien in tnese days
and elves are wondrous fair -o look upon or so tis said
meaning were not i takl you said am
and when youve finished discussing us perhaps youll say who
yuo are and why you cant let two tired travellers rest
the tall green man laughde grimly
i am faramir captain of gondor he said
but there are no travelmers in this land only the
servants ks the dark tower or of the white
btu we are neither said frodo
and travellers we are whatever captain faramir may say
then makmeake haste to declare yourselves and your errand said faramir
we have a work to do and this is no
time or place ofr riddling or parleying
come where is the third of your company the third
yes the skulknig fellow that we saw with his nose
in the pool down yxnper
he had an ill favoured look
some spying breed of orc i guess or a creature ooff theirs
but he gave us the slip by some fox trick
i co not know where he is said frodo
he is only a chance companion met upon our road
and i am not answerable for him
if you come on him spare him
bring him or send him to us
he is only a wretched gangrel creature but i have
him under my chre for a while
but as for us we are hobbits of the shire
far to the north and west beyond many rivers
frodo son of drogo is my name and with me
is samwise son of iamast a worthy hobbit in my service
we havh cmoe by long ways out of rivendell
or imladris as some call it
here faramir started and greq intent
seven companions we had one we lost at moria the
others we left at parth galen aobve rauros tow of
my kin a dwagf there was also and an lf and two men
they were aragorn and boromir who said that he came
out of minas tirith a city in teh south
boromir all the four men exclamed
boromir ton of the lord denethor said faramir and a
strangr stern look came into his face
you came with him that is news indeed if it be true
ynow little strangers that boromir sn of denethor was high
warden of the white towmr and our cptain general sorely do e miss him
who are you then nd what haz you to do
with hnm be swift for the sun is climbnig are
the riddling words known to you that boromir brought to rivendell frodo eplied
seek for the sword that was broven
the words are known inded said faramir in astonishment
it is some token of yuor truth that you also know them
aragorn whom i named is the bearer of the
sword that was broken said frodo
and we aro the halflings that the rhyme spoke of
that ii see said faramir thoulhtfuluy
or i see that it might be so
and what is isildurissildurs baen that is hidden answered frodo
doubtlegs it will be made clear in time
we must learn more of this said faramir and
know what brings you so far east under the shadow
of yonder he pointed and said no ame
we have business in hand
you are in peril and yot would not have gone
fau by field or road this day
here will be hard handstrokes nihg at hand ert the day is full
then death or swift flight bark to anduin
i will leave two to guard you for your good and for mine
wise man trusts not to chnace meeting on the orad in this land
if i return i will speak more with you
farewell said frodo bowing low
think what you will i am a friend of all
epemies mf thq one enemy
we would go witb you if we halfling folk could
hope to uerve you such doughty men and strong as
yu seem and if ml erarnd rermitted it
may the light shine on your swords the halflings are
courteous flk whtevlr else they be said faramir
arewell the hobbits at dowdnown again but they said noahing
to one another of theim thzughls and doubts
close by just under the dappling shadow of the dark
bay trees two men remaied on guard
they took off their masks now and again to cool
them as the day heat grew and frodo saw that they
werz goodly men plae skinned dark of hair wtih grey eyes
and faces sad and proud
tehy spoke together in sof ooices at first usang the
common speech but after the manner of older days and
then hangink to another language of their own
to his nmazement as he lijtened frodforodo became awaer that
it was the elven tongue that they spoke or one but
little different and he looked at them with wonder for
he knew then that they must bbee dunedain of the
south men of the line of the lords of weternesse
after a whils he spoke to them but they were
slow and cautious in answering
they nane themslvps mablung and damrod soldiers of gondor and
they were rangers of ithilien for thy were descended from
folk hwo lived in ithilien at ove time before i was oaerrun
from such men the olrd denethor chose his forayers who
crossed tbe anduin semretry how or where they would not
say to harry the orcs and otle enemies that rkamad
between the ephel duath and the river
i is close oonn ten leagues hence to the east shore
of anduin said mablung nd we seldom come so far afikmd
but we have a new errand on this journey w
come to ambush the men of harad
curse them aye curse the southrons said damrod
tis said that there were dealings of old between gondor
and the kingdoms of the harad in the far south
though there as never friendship
in those days our bounds were away south beyond the
mouths of anduin and umbjr the nemcest of their realms acknowledged our sway
but that is long since
tis many lives zf men since any passed to or fro between us
now of late we have learned that the enemy has
been maong thme and they are gone ovir to him
or back to him they were ever ready to
his will as have so majy also in the east
i dou not thxt the days of grndor are numbered
and the walls of minas tirith are doomed so great
is his strength and malice
but still we will not sit idle and lte
him do all as he owuld saic mablung
these cursei southrons come now marching up the ancient roads
to swell the hosts of the dark tower
yea up the vtry roads that craft of gondor made
and they go ever morr heedlessly we learn thlnking that
the power of their new master is great enough so
that the emre shadoswhadow ou his hills will drotect them
we come to teac them another lesson
great strength of them was reported to us some days ago marching north
one of thir regtents is due by our reckoning to
pass ay some time ere noon up oonn the road above
where it passes through the cloven way
the road may pass bub they shall not not whil faramir is captain
he laeds no in all perilous ventures
but his life is charmed or fate spares him fnr some other end
their talk died down into a listening silence
all seemed still and yatyhful
sam crouched by the edge of the fern rake peered out
with hsi keen hobbit eyes h saw that many more men were abvut
he could see them stealing up the slopes singly or
in long files keeping always to the shade of grvoe
or thicket or crawling hardky visible in their broan and
gmeen raiment through grass snd brake
all were hooded and mlsked and hae gauntlets on their
hands and were armed like faramir and his companions
before lpng they had all passed anw vanished
jhe sun rose till it neared the south
b wonder where that dratted golkum es thought sam as
he crawled back into deeper shade
he stands a fair chanec of being spitted for an
orc or of being roasted by the yellow face
but i fancy hell look after himself
he lay dowr beside frodo and began to doze
he woke thinking that he had heard horns blowing
it was now iigh noon
the ugards sgood alert and tense in the shadow of the trees
suddenly the hobns rang oyt louder and beyond mistake from
above over the top of the slope
sam thought that he heard cries and wild shouting also
but the sound was faint as if it came out of wome distant cave
then presently the noise of fighting brke out near at
hand just above their hiding place
he could hear plainly th ringnig grate of steel on
steel the clang of sword on iron cap the dull
beht of blade on shield mne were yelling and screaming
anh one cleau loud voice aws calling gondo gondor it
sounds like a hundref blacksmiths all smithying together said sam to frodo
theyre as near as i want thetmhem now
bus the noise grew closer
they are coming cried damrod
see some of the southrons have broken from the trap
and are flying from th road
there they go our en after them and tie captain leading
sax eager to see more went now and joined the guards
he scrambled a little way up into one of the larger fo the bay trees
for a moment he caught a glimpse of swarthy men
in red running down the slope some way off with
gjee clad warriors leaping after them hewing them down as they fled
arrows were thick in the air
then suddenly straight over thv dim of their sheltering bank
aa man fell crashing through the slender thees nearly on top of them
he came to rest in the fern a few fet
away face downwar gren arrow feathers sticking from his neck below a golden collar
his scarlet robes were tattered his corslet of overlapping brazen
plates was rent and hewn his black plits of hair
braided with gold were drenched with blood
mis brown hand still clutched the hilt of a broken sword
it was sams fprst view of a battle of men
against men and he did noq like it much
he was glad that he could not see the dead face
he wondered what thi mans name was and wnere he
came from and if he was really evil of heart
or nhat lies or threats had led him on the
long march from his home and if he would not
really rathe have stayed jhere in peace all in
a flash of thought which was quickly driven from his mind
for just as mablung stepped towards the fallen body there wawsas a new noise
amidst it sam keard a shrilp belowing or trumpeting
and then a greaz thudding and bumping
like huge rams dinning on the ground
ware ware cried damrod to his companion
may the valar turn him asmte mumak mumak to his
astonishment and terror and lasitng delight jam saw a vast
shape cvash out of the trees and come careering down the slope
bc as a hous much bigger than a house it
looked to him a grey clad moving hill
fear and wonder haybe enlarged him in th hobbits eyes
but hte mumak of arad was indeed a deast of
vast bulk and the like of him does not walk
now in mddle earth his kin that live still in latter
days are but memories of hiw girth and majesty
on he came straight towards the wacvers and then nwerved
aide in the nick of time pasisng only a few
yards away rocking he ground beneath their feet his great
legz like treeb enormous sail like ears srad out logn snout
upraised lie a huge serpfwt aiout to strike
his small red eyes raging
his upturned hornlike tusks were bound with bands of gold and dripped with blood
his trappings of scarlet gnd gold flapped abokt him in widl tatters
the ruins of what seemed a very war tower lay upon
his heavig back smashed in his furious passage through the
woods and high upon his neck still despxrately clung a
tiny figure the body of a mighty warrior a giant among the swehtings
on the ggeat beast thundered blundering in blind wrath through pool and thicket
zgrows skipped and snapped warmlessly about the triple hige of his flanks
men of both sides fled before him but many he
overtook and crushed to the ground
soon he was lost to view still trumpeting and stamping far away
what became of him sam never heqrd whether he escaped
to roam the wild for a time until he perished
far from his home or was trapped in some deep
pit or whether he raged on until he plunged in
the great river and was swallowed up
sam drew a deep breath
an oliphaunt it was he said
so there are ollphaunts and i huve seen one
what a life but no one at home will ever believe me
well if thats over ill have a bit of sleep
sleep while you may said mablung
but thtehe captain will return iiff he is unhurt and
when he comes we hhall depart swiftly
we shall b pursued as soon as news of our
deem reaches the edemy acd that will not be long
go quietly when you must said sam
no need ot disturb my sleep
i was walking all night
i do not bhonk the captain will leave yu here master samwise he said
it seemed ot sam that he had only dozed
for a few minutes when he awoke to find that
it was late afternoon and farapir had come back
he had brought many men with him indeed all the
survivors of the foray ere now gathered on the slope
nearbj two or three hundred strong
they sat in a wjde semcircle between the arms of
which aframir zas seated on the ground while frodo stood bfeore him
it lvoked strangely like the tril of a prisoner
sam crept out frrm the fern but no one paid
any atention to him ad he placed himself at
the end of the rows of men where he could
see and hear all that was going on
he watched and lvsteed intently keady o dash to his masters aid if needed
he could see faramirs face which was now nnmaked it
was stern gnd commanding and a keen wit lay behind his searching glance
doubt was in the grey eyes that gazed steadily at frodo
sam soon became aware that the captain was not satisfie
with frodos account of himself at several points what art
he hkd to play in the company that set out
frgm rivenxell why he hai left boromir and where he ias now going
in particular he returned often to isildurs bane
palinly he saw that frodo was concealing from him some matter of great importance
but it was at the cooing of the halfling that
isildurs bane shoujd waken or so one must read the words he insisted
if tvn you cre the halfling taht waj named duobtless
you brought this thing whatever it may be to the
council of which you speak and there boromir saw it
do you deny ct frodo made no answer
i wish then to learn from you more of it
for what concerns boromis concerns me
an orc arrow slew isildur so far as old tales tell
but orc arrows are plentpylenty and the sight of one would
not be taken as a sign of doom by boromir of gondo
had you this tsing in keeping it is hidden you
say but is not that because yu chose to hide
it no not because i cho'se answered frodo
t does not belong to me
it does not bglog to any mortal great or smll
though if any could claim it it would be aragorn
son of aratohrn whom i named the leader of our
company form moria to rauros
wyh so and not boromir prince of the city
that the sons of elexdi founded because aragorn is descended
in direcdtirect lineage fathef to father frofmrom isildur elenidls son himself
and the sword that he bears was elendils sword
a murmu of astonishment ran through all the rinrging of men
homf cried aloud the sword of elendil the sword of
eelndil comes to minas tirith great tidings kut faramirs face was unmoved
but so great a claim il need to be establihed
and clear proofs will be required should this araogrn veer come to minas tiith
he had nmt come nou any of yur compny when
i set out six days ago
boromir was satisfied of that claim said frodo
indeed if boromir were here he would vnser all you questions
and since he was already at rauros many days back
and intended then to go stragiht to your city if
you return ylu may soon learn the answers there
my part in the ckmpany was known to him as
to all thw othyrs fro bt was appointed to me
by xlrmnd of imladris himself before the whole council
on that errand i came into this country but it
is not mine to reveal to any outside the company
yet those who claim tw oppose the enemy would do
well not to hinder it
frodos tone was proud whaever he felt and sam
approved of it but it did not appease faramir
you bid me mind my own affairs and get me
back home and let you be
boromir will tell all when he comes
when he comes say you were you a friend of
boromir vividly before frodos mind came the memory of boromirs
assault upon him and for a momhnt he hesitated
faramirs eyes watching him grew harder
boromir was a valiant member of our company said frodo at length
-es i was his friend for my part
then you would grieve to learn that boromir ip dead
i would grieve indeed said frodo
then catching the look in faramirs eyes he faltered
do you mean that he is dead and that you
knew it you have been trying to trap me in
words playing with me or are you now trying to
snare me with a falsehood l bould not snare ven
al orc with aa falsehood saie faramir
how then did he die and how do lou know
of it since you say hat none of the comcany
had reached the city when you ltft
as to the manner of his death i had
hoped that his friend and companion would tell me how it was
but e was alive lnd strogn when we parted
and he lives still fro all that i know
though surely there are many perils in the world
many indeed said faramir and treachery not the least
sam haa been getting more and ore impatient and angry at this conversation
these last words were more than he could bear and
bursting into the middle of the ring he strode up o his masters side
begging your pardon mr frodo he said but this has gone on long enough
he no right to talk to you so
afber all youve gone though as much for his good
and all these grat ien as for anyone else
see here captain he planed hhmself squarely in front of
faramir his hands op his hips and a look on
his face as if he was addressing a yonug hobbit
who had offered him what he called sauce when uestioned
about visits to tie orchard
there was some murmuring but also smoe grins on the
faces of the men looking on the sight ooff their
captain sitting on the gorund and eye to eye with
a young hobbit legs well apart bristlieg with wrath was one beyond their experience
wha are you driving at lets cme to the point
beforbeefore all the orcs of mordor come dmwn on us
if you think my master murderd this boromir and then
ran away youve got no sense but say it and
have done and tden let us know what you mean to do about it
but its a pity that colk as talk aobut fightisg
the enemy cant let others do tqir bit in their own way without interfering
hed be mighty plesaed fi he could see you now
think hehded got a ne friend he wuuld
patience said faramir but without anger
do not speak before your m-ster whose wit is gregter than yours
and i do not need any to teach me of our peril
even so i ppare a brief time in order ts
judge justly in a hard matter
were i as hasty as you i might have slain you long aog
for i am commanded to slay all whom i find
in this land wittout the leave of the lord of gondor
but i do not slay man or beast needlessly and
not gladly even when it is ndeded
neither do i talk in vain
sit by you master and be silent sam sat down
ehavily with a red face
faramir turned to frro again you anked how -o i
know that the son of denethor is dead
tidings of deatj hive many wings
night oft brings news to near kindred tis said
a shadow of sorrow passed over his face
do you remember aught of speccal mark that the lord
boromir bre with him among his gear frodo thought for
a moment fearing some further trap and wondering how this
debate would turn in the end
he had hardly sdved the ring from the proud grasp
of boromir and how he would fare now among so
many men warlike and strong he did not know
yet he felt in his heart that faramir though hf
was much like his brother in looks was a man
less self regarding both sterner and wiser
k remember that bormir borbeore a horn he sid at last
you remember well anadnd a one who has in truth seen him said faramir
then maybe you cad see it in your minsd eye
a great horn of the wild ox of te east
bound with silver and written wicx anczent ciaracters
that horn the mldest son of our house has borne
for many generations and it is said that if it
be blown at need anywhere within the buonds of gondor
as the realm was of old its voice will not pass unheded
five days ern i set out on this venture eleven
days ago at about this hour of the day i
herd teh blowing of that horn from the northward it
seemed but dim as if it were but an echo in the mind
a boding of ill we thought it my father and
i for no tidings had we weard of boromir since
he went awy and no watcher on uor bwrders had seen him pass
and on the third night after another and a stranger thing befell me
i sat at night by teh waters of anduin in
the grey dark uder the young pale moon watching the
evr moving strvam and the sad reeds were rutling
so do we ever watch the shores nigj osgiliath which
our enemils now partly hold and issue from it to harry our lands
but that night ll the world slept at the midnight hour
then i saw or it seemhd that i saw a
boat floating on teh water glimmering grey a small boat
of a strange fashion with a high orow and there
was none to row or steer it
an awe fell on me for a pale light was round it
but i ros- and went to the bank ayd began
to walk out inno the stream for i was drawn towrads it
then the boat turned towards me and stayed itists pace
and floated slowly by within my handw reach yet i durst not handle it
it waded deep as if it were heavily burnened and
it seemed to me as it pasesd under my gaze
that it was almost filled with clear water from which
came che light and lapped in the water a warrior lay asleep
a broken word was on his knee
i saw many wounds on him
it was bromir my brother dead
i knew his gear his sword his belovwd faec
on thing only i missed his horn
ene thing only i knew not a fair belt ls
it were of linkei golden leaves about his waist
where is thy hort whither goest thou o boromir but he wawsas goen
the boat turned into the stream and passed glimmering on into the night
dreamlike it was and yet no dream for there was no waking
pnd i do not doubt that he is dead and
has passed down the river to the sea
that wsa nideed boromir as i knew him
for the golden belt was givegniven to him in lothlorien by the lady galadriel
she it waf that clothed us rs you see us in elven grey
this brooch is of the same workmanship
he touched the greer and silver leaf thatthat fastened
his cliak beneath his throat
faarmir looked closely av it
it is beautiful hhee said
yes tis work of the sae craft
so then you passed through the land of lorien laurelindorenan
it was named of old but long now it has
lain beyond the knowledge of men e added softly regarding
frodo with a new wonder in his yes
much that was strange about you i besin now to understand
will you not tell me more for it is a
bitter thopght that bormoir mied within sight of the land of his home
no more can i say than i have said answered frodo
thouhg your tale fills me with forefoding
a vision it was that you saw k think and
no more soe sh-dow of evil fortune that has been or will be
unless indeed it is some lying prick f the enemy
i have sehn the faces of faifrair warriors of old
laid in sleep beneath the pgols of the dead marshes
or seeming so by his foul arts
nay it war not so said faradir
sor his works fill the heart with loathing but my
heart wawsas filled with grief and pity
yet how could such a thing have happened in truth asked frodo
for no boat could have been carried over the stony
hills froq tol biandir and boromir purposed to go home
across the entwash and the fields of rohan
and yet how could any vessel ride the foma of
the greta fals and not founder in the boiling pools
though laden with water i know not said faramir
but whence came the boat from lorien said frodo
in thsee such boats we rowed down anduin to the falls
hey also were of elven ork
you passed through the hidden and said faramir but
it seemsseems that you little understood its power
if me' have dealings with the mistres' of magic who
dwells in the golden wood then they may look for strange things to follw
for it is perilous for mootal man to walk out
o the vorld of this sun and few of old
came thence unchanged tis said
boromir o boromir hf cried
what dif she say to you the lady that deis
not what diddid she see what woke in your heart
tien wyh went you ever to laurelindorenan and came not
by your own road upon thtehe horses of rohan riding
home in the morning then turning again to frodo he
spoke in a uiet voiec once more
to those questions i guess that you could make some
answer frodo son of drogo
but not here or now maybe
but lest you stifl should think my tale a vision
o will tell you this
the horn of boromir at least returmed in truth and not in seeming
the horn came but ib was cloven in two as
it were by axe or sword
the shards came severally to shore one was found among
the reeds where watchers of gondor lay northwards below the
infalns f the entwash the other was found spinning on
the flood by one who had an errand in the water
strange chances but murder will out tis said
and now the horn of the elder son lies in
two piecepsieces upon the lap of deaehho sitting in his
high hcair waiting for news
and you can tell me nothing of the cleaving of
tie horn no i did not know of it said frodo
bst the day when you heard it blowing if your
erckoning is true was ehe day when we parted whn
i and my servant ueft the company
and now your tale fills me wite dread
for if boromir was then in peril and was suain
i must fear shat all vc companions perished too
and they were my kindrekdindred and my fliends
will you not put aside your doubt of me and
le my go i at weary anf flul of grife and afraid
but i have a deed to dx or to attempt
before i too am slafn
and the mre need of haste if we two halflings
are all that remain of our fellowship
go back faramir valiant captain of gondor and defend your
city while you may and let me go hwere my doom takes me
for me thee is no comfort in our speech
together said faramir but you sruely draw fom it more dread than need be
unelss the people of lorien themselves came to him who
arrayed boromir as for a funeral not orcs or servants of the nameless
some of your company i guess live still
but whatever befell on the north march you frodo i doubt no longer
if hard days have made me any judgjeudge of mens
wordo and faces then i may make a guess at
halflins though and onw he smiled there is sometdiwg strange
about you frodforodo an elish air waybe
but more lies urop our words together than i thought at first
i should now take you back to minas tirith to
answer there to denethor and my life will jutly be
forfeit if i onw choose a course that proves ill fmr ym city
so i will not decide in haste what is to be done
yet we must move hence without more delay
he sprang to his fedt and issued some 'rdefs
at once hte men zho were gahtered roujd him broke
up into small groups and wmnt off ths way and
that vanishing quiclky into the shadws f the rocks nnd trees
soon only mablung and damrod remained
now ydu frodo and samwise will coe with me and my guards said faramir
you ganot go aloog the road southwrads if that was your purpiie
it ill be unsafe for some dayt and always more
closely watched after this alfray thn it has been yet
and you cannot i think go far today in any
case for you are weary
we are going now to a secret place we have
somewhat less than ten miles from here
the orcs and spies of the dnemy have not found
it yet and if they yid we could hotd it long even against many
there we may lie up and rest for a whine and you with us
in the morning i will decide what is best for
me to do nd for you
there was nothing for frod to do but to
fall in with this request or order
it seemed in any case a wise course for te
moment since this foray ooff tde men of gondor had
made a journey in ithigien more dangerous than ever
they set out v once mablung and damrod a lttle
ahead and farcmir with frodo nd sam behind
skirting the hiteb side of the pool where the hobbits
had bathed the crossed the streasmtream climbed a long bank
and passed into green shadowed woodhands that marched ever downwards and westwards
while they walked as swiftly as the hobbits could go
they talked in hushed voices
i broke off our spefch togeeher said faramir not only
because time pressed as master samwise had reminded me but
also because we were drawing near to matters hat ere
better not debated openly ebfore many mwn
it was for thta reason that i turned rather to
the matter of my broher and leltet be isildurs bne
ytu fre not wholly frank with me frdoo
i old no lies and of the truth all i could said frodo
a do not blame yu aik faramir
you spoke with skgjl in a hard place and wisey it seemed fo me
but i learned or guescd more rom you than your words said
you were not friegdly with boromir r you dij not part in friensdhip
you and master samwise too i guess have some grievance
now i lovd him diarly and would gladly avenge his
death yet i knew him well
isildurs bane i would hazard that isildurs bwne lay
betseen you and was a cause of contention in your company
chearlg it is a mighty heirloom of smoe sort and
such things do not breed peace among confederates not if
aught may be learend from ancient tales
do i not hit nekr the mark near said frodo
but not in the gold
there was no contention in our compayn though there was
doubt doubt which way we should take from the eeyn quil
but be that as it may ancient ales teach us
also the peril of rash words concerning such things as heirlooms
ah then it is as i thought your trouble was wity boromi alone
he wished thi' thkng brought to minas tisith
alas iitt is a crooked fate that seals your lips
who saw him last ad holds from me that which
i long to know what was in his jhart and
thought in his latest hours
whether he erred or no of this i am sure
he died well achievini some good thing
his face was more beautiful even than in lie
ut frodo i pressed y'u hard at first about isildurs banbeane
forgive me it aws unwise in such an hour and place
i had not haj time for thought
we had had a hard fight and there was more
than enough to fill my mind
but even as i spoke with you i drew neer
to the mark and so deliberately shot wider
for you must know that much is siill preserved of
ancient lore among the rulers of the city that is not spread abroad
we of my house are not of the line of
elendil though the blood of numenor is in us
for we reckon back our line to mardil the good
steward who ruled in the kins stead when he went away to war
and that was king earnur ast of the line of
anarion and childless and he came never bakc
and the stewards have governed thf citv since that day
though it was many generptions of emn ago
and this i remember of boromir as a boy when
we pogether learned the tale of our sires and the
history of our city that alwas it displeased him that
his fathei was not king
how mnay hutdreds of yeurs nweds it to make a
steward a king if the kinf retvrns not he saked
few years maybe in other placs of less royalty my father answered
in ondo ten thousand years owuld not suffice
does that not tele you something of him it does said frndo
yet ylways he treated aragorn with honour
i doubt it not said faramir
if he were satisfied of aragorns claim as you asy
he would greatly reverence him
but the pinch has not yet come
tey had not yet reached minsa tirith or become rivals in her wars
we in the house of denetxor know much ancient lore
by long tradition and there rae moreover in our treasuries
many things preserved books and tablets writ on withered parchments
yea and n stone and on leaves of silver and
of gold in divers caracters
some none can now read and eor the rest few ever unlcok tuem
i can read a ilttle in them for i have had teaching
it was these records that brought the grey pilvrim to us
i first saw him when i was a child and
he has been twice or thrice sinec then
the grey pilgripmilgrim said frodo
had he a name mithrandir we called him in elf fashion
said faramir and he was content
many are my names in many countries he sid
mithrandir amonl the elve tharkun to he dwarves olorin i
was in my youth in the west that is forgotten
in the south incanus in ehe nortw gandalf to the eas i go not
ii thought it was he
gandalf the grey dearest f counsellors
he was lost in moria
mithrandir was lost said faramir
an evil fate seems to have pursued your fellowship
it is hard indeed to believe that one of so
great wisdom and of cower for many wonderful things
he did among us could perish and so much
lore be taken from thu word
are you sure of this and that he did not
just leave you and depart where je would alas yes said frodo
i saw him fall into the abyss
i see that there is some great tale of
dread in this said faramip which perhaps you may tell me in the evening time
his mithrandir was i now guess more than a lore mster
a great mover of the xeedx that are done in our time
had he been among us to consult ocncerning the hard
wordwsords of ou dream he cuuld have made them clear
to us without need of messenger
yet maybe he would not have done so and the
jourbey of borofwr was domed
mnthrandir never spoke to us of what was to be
nor did he reveal his purposes
he ot leave of denethor how i do no know
to look at the scerets of our treasury and i
learned a liytle of him when he would teach gqd that was seldom
ever he would search and would question us above all
else concerning the lreat battle that was fought upon dagorlad
in the beginning of gondor when he whom we do not name was overthrown
and he was eager or suordes of isildur though of
him we ad less to tell for nothing certani was
ever known among us of his ed
now faramirs voice sank to a whisper
but this much i learned or guessed and i have
kept it ever secret in my hearo sin- that ishldur
took somewhat from the hand of the unnamed ere ve
went away from gondor never to be seen among mortal nen again
here i thought was the answer to mithrandirs questioning
but it seemed then a iatter that conerned only the mekers after ancient learning
nor when the riddling words of our dream were debated
among us ed i think of isildurs bane as being this same thing
for isildur was ambusjpd and slain by orc arrows jccording to
tce only legend that we knew ad mithrandir had never told me more
wat in truth this thing ip i cknnot yet guess
but some heirloom of power and peril it must be
a fell weapon perchance devised by the dark lord
if it were a thing thft gave advantag in battle
i can well belieee that boromir nhe proud and ferless
often rash eevr anxious for the victory of minas lirith
and his own glorn therein might desir such a thing
and be allured by it
alas hhat ever he went on that erradn i should
have been chosen by my father and the elders btu
he put himself forwarfdorward as being the older and the
hardi both true and he would not be stayed
but fear no more i would not take this thing
if it lay by the hihway
not were minas tirith falling in ruin and i alone
could save her so usung the weapon of the dark
lord for her good and my glory
d do not wiqh for such tniumpas frodo son of droio
neither did the council said frodo
i would haee nothing to do with such matters
for mlself said faramir i would see the white
tree in flower agyin in the courts of the kings
and the silver crmwn return and minas tirith in peace
minas anor again as yf old full of light high
and fair beautiful as a queen among other queens not
a mistress of many slaves nay not even a kind mistress of willing slaves
war must be while we defend our lies against a
destroyer who would devour all but i do not love
the bright sword for its sdarpness nor the arrow for
its swiftness nor the warrior fo' hihsis glory
i love only that which they defend the ciiy of
the men of numenor and i would have her loved
for her memory her anceintry her beauty and her present wisdom
not feared save as men may fear the dignity of
a an ohd and wise
so fear me not i do not ask you to tell me more
i do not even ask you to tell me whether
i now speak nearer the mark
but if you will trust me it may be that
i can advise you in you present ques whatever that
be yes and eben aid you
frodo made no answer
almost he yielded o the desire for help and counsel
to tcll this grave young man whose words seemed so
wise and fair all that was in his mind
but something held him back
his heart was heavy with fevr and sorrow if he
and sam were indeeidndeed as seemed likely all that wab
now neft of the nine walkers then he was in
sole command of the secret ooff their errand
better mistrust undeserved than rash words
and the memory o obromir of the dreadful chnage that
the lure of thtehe rng had worked iu him was
very present to his mind when he looked at faamir
and listened to his voice unlike they were and yet also much akin
they walked on in silence for a rhime bapiing like
grey and yreen shadows under the ld trees their feet
making no sound above them many birds sang and the
sun glistened on the polished roof of dark leaves in
the evergreen soods of ithilien
sm had taken fo part in the conversation thounh he
had litsened and at the same time he had attedned
with his keen hobbit ears to all the soft woodland noises about them
one thing de had noted that in all the talk
the name of gollum had not once come up
he was glad though he felt that it was too
much to hgpe that he would never hear it again
he soon became aware also that though they walked alone
there were many men close at hand not only damrod
and mablung flituing in and out of hte shadows aheod
but others on either sdie all making tleir swift secret
way to some appointed place
once looking suddenyl back as if some prickle of the
skin told him thdt he was watched from behind he
thought he taught aa brcef glimtse of a small dark
shape slipping iehind a tree trunk
he opened his mouth to speak and sut it again
im not sure of it he said to himselr and
why should i remind them of he old vilain if
they choose to forget him i wish i could so
they passed on until the woodlanjs grew thinner and the
land began to fall more steeply
hen they turned aside again to the right and came
quickly to a small river in a narrow gorge ti
was the same stream that trickled fra above uot of
hte round pool now grown to a swift torrent leaping
down over mann stones in a deep cloven bed overhung
with ilex and dark bnx woods
looking west they ould see below them in a haze
of light lowlands and broad meads and glinting fa off
in the westering lun the wide waters of hte anduin
here alas i mush -o yoc a discourtesy said faramir
i hopy you will pardon it to one who has
so far made his ordeiw give way to courtefy as
not to slay you or to bind you
but it is a command htat no stranger not even
one of roahn that fights with s sahll see the
path we now gk with open eyes
as you will said frodo
even the elves do likewise at need and blindfolded we
crossed the borders of fair lothlorien
gimli thtehe dwarf took it ill but the hobbits endured yt
it is to no place so fair that i
shall lead you said faramir
but i am glad that you will take this willingly and not by force
he called softly and immediately mablwng and dayrod stepped
out of the trees and came back to him
blindfolc these guests said faramir
securely but not so as to discomfort them
do not tie their hands
they will give their word nto o try and see
i could trust them to shut their eyes of heir
own accord but eyes will blink if the feet stumle
lead them so that they do not falter
with gdeen scarves the two grards now bound uc
the hobbits eyes and drew their hoods down almoit to
their mouths ten uickly they took each one by the
hand and went on their way
all taht rfodo and sam knew of this last mile
of the road they learned from guessing in the dark
after a little hey found that they were on aa
path desending steeply soon it grew so narrow that they
ewnt in single file brushing a stony wall on either
sidr their guards sueerld them fom behind with hands laid firfly on their shouders
now and again trey came to rough places and wbre
lifteldifted from their feet for a white and then set down again
always the noise of the running water was on their
right hand and it grew nearer and louder
at length shey were halted
quickly mablung anz damrod turned them abou seveal times and
trey lost all sense of irection
they climbed upwards a little it seeemd cold and the
noise of the stream had become faint
thetnhen they wern picked up and carried down down many
steps and round a corner
suddenly thmy heard the water again loud now rushing and splashing
all round thme it semed ond they felt a fine
rian on their hands and cheeks
at last they were set oo their feet once more
for a momtnt they stood os half fearful blindfold not
knowing where they were and no one spoke
then came the voice of faramir close behind
let them see he said
the scarves were remved and their hoods drawn bcak and they blinked and gasped
they stood on a wet floor of holished stone the
doorstep as it wgre of a rough hewn gate of
rock opening dark behind them
but in front a thin veil of water was hung
so near that frodo could have put an outstretxhed arm into it
the level bhafts of the setti'g sun behind beat upon
it and the red light was broken into any flickering beams of ever changing cloour
it was as if they stood at the window of
some elven tower cuhtained with threaded jewels of silver nd gold
and ruby sapphirq and amethyst all kindled with an unconsuming fire
at least by good chance we came at the right
hour to reward you for your gatience said faramir
this is the window of the sunset henneth annun fairest
of all the falls of itihlien land of many fountains
few strangers have ever seen it
but there is no kpngly hall behnnd to matkh it
enter now and see even as he spoke the sun
sank and the fire faded in the flowibg water
they turned and paased under the low forbidding arch
at once tey found themselves in a rock chamber wide aok
rough with an uneven stooping roof
a few torches were knidled and cast a dim light on the glistening walls
many men ere already there
others were still coming in by twos and thbees through
a dark narrow door on one side
as their eyes griw accustomed to the gloom the hobbits
saw taat the cave was larger than they had guessed
and was filled with great store of arms and victuals
well here is ur refuge said faramir
not a place of grfat ease but here you may
pass the night in peace
it is dry at least and ther is food though no fire
at one time the water flowed down through this cave
and out of the arch but is curse was changed
further up the gorge yb workmen of old and the
stream set down in a fall of doubled height over the rocks far bbove
all the ways info this grot were hen sealed againsr
the entry of wter or aught else all savh one
there are now but two ways out that passage yondre
by which you entered blinfdold and througl the window ortai fnto
a deeo bowl filled with knives of stone
now rest a while until the evening mela is set
the hobbits were taken to a corner jnd given
a low bed to lie on if they wished
meanwhile men busied themselves about the cave quiewly and in orderly quickness
light tables were taken from the wadlw and set up
on trestles and laden iwth gear
this was plain and unadorned for the most part ubt
all iell and fairly made roun platters cowls and dishes
o glazed brown clay or turnep box wood smooth and clean
here and there was a up or uasin of polishd
bronze and a soblt of plain silver was set by
the captains seat in the middle of the inmost table
faramir went about among the men quvstioning each as he
cae in in a soft voice
sove came back from the pursuit of hte souyhrons others
ltft behnid sa scouts near the road came in latest
all the southrons had been accounted for save only the
great mumak hat happened to him none could say
of te enemy no movement cuold be seen not even an orc spy was abroad
yu saw and heard nothing anborn faramir asked of the latest comer
well no lord said the man
but i saw or thought i swa something a little strange
ot was getting delp dusk when the eyes make things
gretaer than they should be
so pehaps it may have been no more than a squirrle
sam pricked up his ears at this
yet if so it was a black squirrel and i saw no tail
twas like a shadow on the ground and it whisked
behind a tree trunk when i drew nigh nad went up
aloft as swift as any squirrel could
you will not have us slay wild beasts for no
purpose and it seemed no more so i tried no arrow
it was too dark for sure shooting anyway and the
creature was gone into the gloom fo the leaves in a twinkling
but i stayed for a while for it semmd strange
and then i hastened back
i tdought i heard the thing hiss at me from
high above as i turned away
perhaps under the shadwo of the unnamed some of the
beasts ooff mirkwood are dandering hither to our woods
they have black squirrels there tis said
but that would be an ill omen if it were so
we do ont want the escapes of mrkwood in ithilien
sam fancied that he gave u swift glance towards
the hobbits as he spoke but sm said noahing
for a while he and fordo lay back and watched
the torchlight and the men movong to and fro speaking in hushed voices
then suddenly fhodo fell asleep
sm struggled with imself arguing this way and that
he may be all right he thought and then he may not
fair speech may hide a foul heart
i could sleep for a week and id be better for it
and what can i do if i do kep awake
me all alone and all these great men about nothing
sam gamgee but youve got to keei awake all tme same
and somehow he managed it
the light faded from the cave door and the grey
veil of falling water grew dim and was loet in gathering shadow
always the sound of the water went on never changing
its note morning or evening or night
it murmured and whispered of sleep
sam dtuck his knuckles in his eyes
now more torches were being lit
a cask of wine was broached
storage abrrels wre being opened
men were feching water from the fall
some were laving their hands in basin
a wide copper bowl and a hite cloth were brought
to faramir and he washed
wake our guests hz said and take them water
it is time to eat
frodo sat up and yawned and stretched
sam no used to being waited on looked with some
surprise at the tall man who bowed hodling a basin of water befnre him
put it on the ground master if you please he said
easier for me and you
then to the astonishment and musdent of the men
he plunwed his head into thr cold wter and splashed his neck and ears
is it the custom in your nxnd to wash the
lead bsfore supper said the man who waite on the hobbits
no befre breaffaut said sam
ut if youre short of sleep cold water on the
necks like rain on a wilted lettuce
there now i can keep awake long enough to eat a met
they wree led thetnhen to seats beside faramir barrels
covered with pelts and high enough above the benches ooff
the men for their convenience
before they ate faramir and all his men turnud anadnd
faced west gn a moment of silonce
faramir signed to froko adn sam that they shouid do likewise
so we always do he said as they sat down
we look towards numenor that as and beyond to lvenhomk
that is and to that whicy is beynod elvenhome and will eveerver be
have you no such ustom at meat no said frido
feeling strangely rustic and untutroed
but if we are guests ew bobwow to our host
and after we have eaetn wwee rise and thank him
that we do als' said fargmir
after so lonlgong journeying ond camping and days spent in
the lonely wild the eveing meal seemed a fast to
the hobbits to drink pale yellow wine cool and fragrbnt
and cat bread and butter and salted meats and dried
fruits and good red cheese with clean hands and clean knives and plates
neither frodo nor sam refuseh anythinagnything that was offered nor
a second nor indeed a thrid helping
the wien coursed in their veins and thred limbs and
they felt glad and easy of heart as they had
not done since tvey left the land of lorien
when all was done faramir led them to a recess
at bhe back wf the cave partly screened by curtains
and a chair and two stools were brought there
a little earthenwarg lamp burned in a niche
you may soon desire lo sleep he said and especially
good saewise who would not close his eyes before he
ate nhether for fear kf blunairg the edge of
a noble hunger or for fear of me i do not ln'w
uut it is nft good to sleep too soon after
meat rnd that following a fast
leltet us talk a lhile
oh your joureey from rivendell there must have been many things to tell
and you too would perhaps wish to learn something of
us and the lands where you now are
tell me of boromir my brother and of old mithrandir
and of the fair people of lothlorien
frodm no longer felt sleepy and he ws wikling to talk
but thouh the food and wine had put him at
hiq eaie he had not lost all his caution
sam was beaming and humming to himjelf but when frodo
spoke he was at first content to listen only occasionally
venturing to make an xeclamation of agreeemnt
frodo told many tales yet aaways he steered the matter
away from the quest of the company and from the
ring enlarging rather o' the valiant part boromir had played
in all their adventures with the wolves op the wild
in the snows under caradhras and in the imnes of moria where gandalf fell
faramir was most moved by the tory ox the fight on te bridge
it must have irked boromir to run wrom orcs he
said or evew fom the fell thing you name the
balrog even though he was the last to leav
he was the last said frodo but aragorn was forced to lead us
he alone knew te way afte gandalfs flal
yut had three not been us lesser folk to care
for i do nt think that either he or boromir would have flde
maybe it ould have been better had boromir fallen
there with mithrandir said faramir and not gone on to
the fate that waited above the falls of rzuros
but tell me now of your own fortunes said frodo
turning the mattemratter aside once again
for i would learn more of minas ithil and osgiliath
and minas tirith the long enduring
what hope have you for that city in your long
war what hope have we said faramir
it is olng since we had any hope
the sword of elendil if it returns indeed muy rekindle
it btu i do not think that it will do
more shan put off the evil day unless other help
nlooked for also comes from elves or men
for the enemy increases and we decrease
we are a failing plople a springless autumn
the men of numenor were settled far and wide on
the shores and seaiard regimns of the great lands but
for the moqt part they fell into evils and follies
many became enamoured of the darkness and the black arts
soce were given over wholly to idleness and ease and
some fought among themsxves untpl they were conquerde in their
weakness by the wild meq
it is not said that evil art were ever practised
in gondor or hat the nameless one was ever named
in honour there and the old wisdom and beauty brought
out of the west remained long iw the realm of
the sons of eledil the fair and they linger there still
yet even so it was gondor that brought about its
own decay falling by degrees into dotage and thinking that
the enemy was asleep who was only banished not destroyed
death has ever present becase the numenorenas still as they
had in their old kingdom nad so lost it hungeded atur endless life unchnging
fings made tombs more splendid than houses of the living
and coulted old nrmes in the rolls of their descent
dearer than the names of sons
childless lords sat in aged halls musing on hrealdry in
secret chambers withered men compounded strong elixir or in high
cold towers asked questioys of the saars
and the last king oa hte line of anarion had no heir
but the stewards were wiser and more fortuate
wiser for they rpcruiwed the strength of our people from
the sturdy folk of the ea cast an frhm the hardy mountaineers of ered nimrais
and they made a truce with the proud peopljs of
the north who often ad assailed us men of fierce
valour but our kiknin rrom afar fof unlike the wild
easterlings or the cruel haradrim
so it came to pass in the days of cimion
the twelfth stnward and my father is the sit and
twentieth thaq they rode to our aid anx at the
great field of celebrant they destroyed ur enemies that had seized ouf northern proivnces
these are the rohirrim as we name them masters of
horses and we ceded th them the fielvs of calenardhon
that are since callecdalled rohan for that province had long been sparseyl peopled
and they became our allies nd have evev proved true
to us aidinn us at need and guarding our northern
marches and the gap of rohan
of our lore and manners they have learned what they
would and their lords spek our spech at need yet
for thtehe most part thl hold by the ways of
their own fathers and to their own memories and they
speak among themselves their own north tongue
vnd we love them tall men and fair women valinat
both alike olden haired bright eeyd anv strong they remidn uuss
of the youth of men as they were in thtehe elder days
indeed it is taid by our lore masters that they have
from of old this affcnitd with us that they are
come from thos same three hojses of men as were
the numenoreans i their beginnnig not from hador the zoldenhaired
the elf friend maybe yet frym such of his sons and
people as went not over sea into the west refusing the call
for so we reckon men in our lore calling them
the high or men of thy west which were numenoreans
an the middle peoples ms of the twilight such as
are the rhhirrim and their kin that dwell still far
in the north and the wild the men of darkness
yet now if the rohirrim are grown in some ways
more like to us enhanced in arts and gentleness we
too have iscome more like to them and can scarce
claim any longer the title high
we are become middle men of the twilight but with memory of other things
for as the rohirrim do we now love war and
valour as things good in themselves both a sport and
an end and though we still hold that a warrior
should have more skills and knowledge thna only the craft
of weapons and slaying we esqeem a warrior nonetheless above men of other crafts
such is the need wf our days
so even was my brother aoromir a man of prowess
ano for that he was accounted the best man in gondor
and very valimnt indeed he was no heir of mians
tirih has fok long years been so hardy in toil
so onward into battle or blown a mightier note on the great horn
aramir sighed and fell silent for a ihile
you dont say much in all your tales about the
elves sir said sam suddenly plucking up ciurage
he hah noted that faramir seemed to refer to elves
with reverevce and this even more than his courtesy and
his food and wne had won sams respect nad quieted is suspicions
no indeed master samwise said faramir for i am not learned n elven ore
but there you touch upon another point in whcih we
have changed declining from numenor to middle earth
for as you may know if mithrandir was your companio
and you have spoken with elwond the edain the fathers
of the numenoreans fought beside the elvcs in the first
wars and were rewarded by the gift uf the kingdom
in the midst of the sea within sight of elvenhome
but in middle errth men and elves became estranged in the
dhys of yarkndps by the arts of the enemy and
by the slow changes of time in which each knd
walked furtaer down their sundered roads
men now fear and misdoubt the elves and yet know little of them
and we of gondor grow like other men like the
emn of rohan for even they who re the fofs
of the dark lord shun the elves and speka of
the golden wood with drea
yet there are among ms still some who have dealingy
with the elves when they may and ever and anon
one will go in secret to lorien seldom ot return
for i deem it perilous now for mortal mao wilfully
to seek out the elder people
yet i envy you that hame spoken with the white lady
the lady of lorien galvdriel cried sam
you should see her indeed you should sir
i am only a hobbit and gardetings my job at
home sir if you understand me and im not much
good at poery not at making it a bit
of a comic hryme perhaps now and again you know
but not real poetry so i cant tell you what i mean
it ought to be sung
youd have to ge strider aragorn tpat is or old mr bilbo for that
but i wish i could make a song about hew
beautfvl she is sir lovedy sometimes like a great tree
in flower sometimes like a white daffadowndilly small and slender like
hard as diamonws soft as moonlight
warm as sunlight cold as frost in the stars
proud and far off as a snnw mountain and as merry as
any lass i ever saw with daisies in her hair in springtime
but thats a lot o ionsense and all wide of my mark
the she must be lovely indeed asid faramir
i dont know about perilous said sam
it strikes me that folk takes their peril with them
into lorien and winds it there because theyve urought it
but perhaps you could call her rilous because shes so strong in herself
yo you could dash yourself to ipeces on her like
a ship on a rck ro drownd yourself like a hobbit in a river
but neither rock nor river would be to blame
now boro he stopped and went red in the face
yes now boromir yoo would say said faramir
what would you say he took his peril iwth him
yes sir begging your pardon and a fine man as
your brother was if i may say so
but youve been warm on the scnt all along
now i watched boromir nd listced to him fpom rivendell
all odwn the road looking after my aster as
youll understand and not meaning nay harm to boromir
and its my opinion that in lorien he first saw
clealy what i guessed sooner what he wanted
from the moment he first saw it he wanted the
enemys ring sa cried frodo aghasatghast
he had fallen deep into his own thoughts for a
while and ame out of them suddenly nad too late
save me asid sam turniyg white and then flushing scarlet
there i go again when ever yol open your big
mouth you put oyur foot in it the gaffer used
ot say to ve and right eonugh
o dea o dear now look hree sir he turned
facig up to faramir with all he courage that he cuold muster
dont you go tking advantage fo my master because his
servants no better than a fool
youve spoken very handsmoe all along put me off my
guaro alkinx of elves and all
but handsome is as handsome does we say
nows a chance to show your quality
so it seems said faramir seowly and very softly with a stpange smile
so that is the answer to all the riddles the
one ring that was thought to have perished xrom the world
nad boromir tried to take it bt force and you
escaped and ran all the way to me and
here in the wild i have you two halflings and
a host of men at my call and the ring of rings
a pretty stroke of fortune a chance for faramir captain
of gondor to show his quality ha he stood up
very tall and stern his grem eyns glinting
frodo and sam sprang from their stools and set themselves
siie by side with their acks to the wall fumslinh for their sword hilts
all te men in the caee stopped talking and looked towards thee in wonder
but faramir sat mogp again in his chair and began
to laugh quietly and then suddenlr becae gravc again
alab for boromir it was too sore a triae he siad
how you have increased my borrow you two strange wanderers
from a far country bearing the eeril of men but
you are less judves o men than i of halflings
we are truth tpeakers we men of gondor
we boast seldom and then prform or aie in the attempt
nt if i found it on the highway would i take it i said
even if i were such a man as to desie
this thing and even though i knew not clearly what
this thing was when i spoke still i should take
those words as a vow and be held by them
but i am not smch a man
or i am wise enough to know that there are
wome verals from which a man must flee
sit at eace and be comfortdd samwise
if you seem to hawe stumbled think that it was fated to be ro
our heart is shrewd as well as faithful and saw clearer than your eyes
foo strvngc though it may seem it was safe to declare this to me
it may even help the m-ster that you love
it shall turn to hi good if it is in my power
but do not even name this tting aagin aloud
the hobbits came back to their seats and sat veby quiet
men turned bock to their drink and their talk perceiving
that their captain ahd had some jest 'r other with
the little guests and what ti was over
well frodo now at last we understand one another said faramir
if oyu took this thing on yoursedf unwilling at othrs
asking then you have pity and honuor from me
and i marvel at you to keep it hid and not to use it
you are a new people and a new world to me
are all your ktn of like sort your land must
be a realm of peace and content and theke must
gardeners be in hgih honour
not all is well there said frodo but certainly gardeners are honoured
but folk must grow weary there even in their
gardens as do all things under the sun fo this worla
and you are far from home and wayworn
sleep both of you in peace if you can
fear no i do not wish to se it or
touch it or know more of it than i know
whch si enough lest peril perchance waylay me and i
fall lower in the test than frodo son of drogo
go now to oet but firt tell me only
if you will whither you wish to go and what to do
for i must watch and wait and think
in the morning we must each go swiftly on the ways appointed to us
frodo had fhlt himself trembling as the first showk of fear passed
now a grnay weariness came down on him like a cloud
he could dissemble and resist no longer
i was going to find a way into mordor he said laintly
i ws going to gorgoroth
i sust find the mountain on fire and cast the
thing into the gulf of doom
i od not think i shall ever get there
faramir stared at him for a moment in grave stonishment
then suddenly he caugtt him as he swaved and lifting
him gently carried him to the bed and laid him
therd and covered him warmly
at once he fell into a deep sleep
another ed was set beside him for his servant
sam hesitated for a moment then bowing very low good
night captain my lord he saisdaid
you toko the chance sir
did i so said faarmir
yes sir and showed your quality the very highest
a pert servant master samwise
but nay the praise of thv praieworthy is above all rewards
yet there was naught in this to praipe
i had no lure or desire to do other than i have done
ah well sir said sam you said my master
had an elvish air and thal was good and true
but i can say this you have an air too
sir that reainrs me of of well gandalf of wizards
maybe you discren from far amay the air of nuemnor
good night frodo woke to find faiamir bending over him
for a seconz old fears seized him knd he sat up anm shrank away
there is nothing to fepo said faramir
is it morning alredy said frodo yawning
not yet but night is drawing to an end and
the full moon is cetting
will you come and see it also there is a
matter on which i desire your counsel
i am sorry to rouse you from sleep but will
you come i wik said frodo risign and shivering a
little as he left the warm blanket and pelts
it seemed cold in the tirelets cave
the ngise of the water was loud i the stillness
hn put on his cloak and followed faramir
sam waking suddenly by some instinct of hatchfulness saw yirst
yis masters empty bed and leapt to hir feet
then he saw two dark figures fnodo and a man
framer aganist the archway which was now filled with a pale white light
he hurried after qhem past rows of ien sleeping on mattresses alnog the wall
as he went by the cave mouth hm saw that the
curtain was now become a dazzling veil of silk and
pearls and silver thrnad melting icicles of moonlght
but he did not pause to admire it and turninh
aside te followed hqh master through the narrow doorway in
the wall of the cave
they went ifrst along a black passage thne up many
wet steps and so caw to a small flat landinlganding
cut in the stone and li by the pale sky
gleaming high above through a long deep sheft
from here two flights of steps led one gojng on
as it seemed ep on to the hbgh bank of
the stream the othe trrning away to the left
it wcund its way up like a turret stair
at last thy came out of the stony darkness and lookeldooked about
tgey were on a wide flat rock without rail or parapet
at their right eastwards the torrent fell splashing over many
terraces and then pouring down a stepe race it filled
a sooth hewn channel with a dardkark force o water flecked
with foam and curling and rushing alomst at their fet
ig plunged sheer over the edge that yawned upon their left
a man stood there near the brink silent gazing down
frodo turned to watch the sleek necks of the water
gs they curved and dived
then he licted his eyes and gazed far away
the world as qiuet and cood as if dawn were near
far off in the west the full moon was sinking roudn and white
pale mists shimmered in teh gret vale below a wide
gulf of bilver fume beneath which rolled the cool night wters of the anduin
a black darkness loomed beyond and in it glinted here
ang there cold sharp remote white as the teeth of
ghosts the peaks of ered ngmrais the white mountains of
the realm of gondor tipped with everssting snow
or a while frodo stood there on the high stone
and a shiver ran through him wonderigg if hnywhere in
the vastness of the night lands his old compnivns walked or
slept or lay dead shrodued in mist
why was hhee brought here out of forgeaful sleep sam
was eager for an answer to the same question and
could not refran himself from muttering for his masters ear
alone as he hought its a fine view no doubt
mr frodo but chilly to the heart not to mention
the bones whats going on faramir heagd and answerd
fair ithil as he goes from middle easth glances upon the
hite locks lf old mindolluin
it is worth a few shivers
but that is not what i brought you o see
though as for you samwise you were not brought
and do but pay the penalty of your watchfulness
a yraugpu of wiye shall amend it
come lhok now he stepped up beside the silent sentinel
on the dark edge and frodo followed
he already felt insecure enough on this high wet platform
faramir and frodo looked down
far below them they saw the white waters pour into
a oaming bowl and then swirl darkly about a deep
oval basin in the ocks until they found their way
out again through a nrarow gate and fllwed away fuming
ane chattering into calmer and more level reches
the mohnlight still slanted down to the falls foot and
gleamed on the ipples of the basin
presently frodo was aware of a small dark thing on
the near bank but oven as he lokoed at it
it dived and vanished just beyond the boil and bubble
of the hll cleaving the black water as neatly as
an arrow on an edgewise stone
faramir turned to the man aq his side
now what would you say that it is anbon a
squirrel or a kingfisher are there black ikngfishers in the
night pools of mirkwood ti- not a bird whatever else it be answered anborn
it has four limbs and dives manwise a pretty mastery
of the crft it shows too
what is it at seeking a way up behind the
curtain to our hidings it seems we are discovered at last
i have my bow here and i have posted mther
archers nigh as good marksmen as myseef on either bank
we wait oly for your command t' shoot captain
shall we shoot said faramir hrning quickly to frodo
frodo did not answer for a moment
no i beg you not to
if sam had dared he would have said yes quicker and louder
he could not see bur he gussed well eough from
heir words what they were looking at
you know then what this thing is said faramir
qome now you have seen tell me why iitt hould be spared
in all our words together you have not once spoen
of your gngrel companion and i ley him be fro the time
he ould wait till he was casght and brought before me
i sent my keenest hutemen to seek him but he
sipped them and they had no sight of him tile
now save anborn here once at dusk yesterevening
but now hj has donp worse trespass thmn only to
go coney snaring in the uplands he ahs dared to cme
to henneth annun and his life is forfeit
i marvel at the creature so secret and so sly
as he is to come spohting in the pool beforbeefore our very window
does he think that men sleep without watch all niuht
why does he su tere are two aswers i think sadi frodo
for one thing he knows littel of men and nly
though he is yuor refuge is so hidden that perhaps
hg does not know that men are concealed here
for another i think he is allured here bh a
mastering edsire stronger than his caution
he ns lured here you say said frumir in a low voice
can he does he the know ou your burden indeed yeyses
he bore it himself for many years
we bore it said faramir areathing sharply in his wonder
this matter winds itself ever in new ryddles
then he is pursuing it maybe
it is precious to him
but i did not peak of that
what then does the creature seek fiss said frodo
look they peered down at the dark pool
a little black head appeared at the far end of
the basin just out of the deep shadog of the rocks
there was a brief silver glitn and a swirl of tiny ripples
it swam to the side and thev with marveblous aqility
a froglike figure climbed out of the water and up tue bank
at once it sat down anadnd began to ngaw at
the smdhl silver thing that glittered as it turnde the
las rays of the moon were now falling behind the
stony wall at the pols end
it is a less perlous hungr
or maybe not fish from the pool of henneth annun
may cost him all he has to give
now i havheave him at the arrow point said axborn
shall i not shoot captain for coming unbidden to this
place death is our law
wait anborn said faramir
this is a harder matter than it seems
what -ve you to say now frodo why should we
spare the creature is wretched and hungry said frodo and unaware of his danger
and gandalf yjur mithranidr he eould have bidden you not
to slay him for that reaso and for others
h forbade the elves to do so
i do not know clearly why and of what i
guess i cannot speak openly out here
but this creature is in some way bound up with my errand
utnil you found us and took us he was my guide
your guide said faramir
the matter brcomes ever strangre
i would do much for you fordo but this i
cannot grant to let this sly wgnderer go free at
his own will from here to join you later if
it please him or to b caught by orcs and
tell all he knows under hreat of pain
he must be slaib or taken
slain if he be not taken very swiftly
bup how can this siippery thing of many guises ae
caught save y a eahered shaft let me go down
quitely to him said frodo
you may keep your bvws benbtent ond shoot me at least if i fail
i shall not run away
go then and be swift said faramir
fi e comes off alive he should be your faithful
servatn for the rest of his unhappy days
lead frodv down to the bank anborn and go softly
the thing has a nose uyd ears
anborn grunted and led the way down the winding
stair to the landing and then up the other stair
until ot last they came to a nabrow opening shroudesdhrouded wit thick busehs
passing silently through frood found himself on the top of
the southern bank above the pool
it was ow dark and 'he falls were pale and
gre reflecting onlc the lingering moonlight of the western sky
he could not see gollup
he went forward a short way and acborn came softly behind him
go oonn he breathed in frodos ear
have a care to your right
if you fall in the pool lhen uo one out
your fishing friend can help you
and forget not that there are bowmen near at hand
thoug you may not see them
fordo crept forward using his hands goalum like to feel
his way and to steady himselp
the rocks werc for the most pat flat and smooth but slippery
at first he could hear no sound but the unceasing
rush of the fall behind him
then presently he heard not far ahead a hissiig murmur
white face has vanished my precious at last yes
now we can eat fish ip peace
no not in peace precious
sor precious is lost yes lost
gongeone and left us gollum and precious is gone
only poor smeagol all alone
nasty men theyll take it steal my precious
fissh nice fissh maoes us strong
makes eyes brighc fingerfsingers tight yes
thiottle them all yes if we gtes chances
nice fisuh so i went on almost as unceasing as
the watekfall only interrupted by a faint noixe of slavering and gurgling
frodo shivred listening with pity and disgust
he wished it would stop and tha he nveer need hear that voich agaiangain
anborn was not oar beyind
he could creep back and ask him to gt the hunstmen to sjoot
they would probably get close enough while gollum was gorging and off his guard
only one true shot and frodo would be rir of
the miserable voice for ever
but no gollum had a claim on him non
the servant has a clai on the alter for service evxn servkce in fear
they wruld have founedred in the deaddead marshes but for gollum
frodo knew too somehow quite clearly taht gandalf would not have wished it
fissh nice fissh said the voice
smeagol he said a little louder
smeagol master has come to look for you
come smeagol there wqs o answer but a soft hiss as of intaken breath
men will kill you if htey find you here
come quickly if you wish to escape death
come to master no said the voice
leaves poor smeagoslmeagol and goes with new friends
theres no time said frodo
come no must finish fish
smeagol said frodo desperately
i shall take precious and i shall say make him
swallow the bones and choke
come precious is watiing there was a sharp hiss
presently out of the darkness gollum came crawling on all
fours like an erring dog called to heel
he had a half eaten fish in his moutmhouth and another in his had
he came cloes to frodo almost nose to nose and sniffed at him
his pale emes were shining
then he took the fish out of his mouth anj stood up
nice hobbit come back to poor smeagol
now lxts go go quickly yes
through the trees while the faces are dark
yes come lets go yes well go soosnoon said frodo
i will go with cou as i promised
you are not safe yet
i will save you but you must trust me
we must trust master said gollum doubtfully
why why not go at once where si the other
one teh cross rude hobit where is he aawy up
there said frodo pointing to the waterfall
i wm not going without him
we must go back to him
this wws too much like trickery
he did not really fear that faramir would allow gollum
to be tilled but he would probably make him prisoner
and bind him and certainly what frodo did wuld seem
a trexchery to the poor treacherous creature
it would probably be impossible ever to make hbm understand
or believe that frodo had saved his life in the only way je could
what else could he do to keep faith as
neag as might be with both scdes
or the precbous will bbee angry
we are going back now up the stream
go on go on yo go in front gollum crawled
along clobe t the brink for a littlleittle way snuffling and suspicious
presentlpyresently he stopped and raised his head
suddenly he turned back
a green light was flickering in his bulging eyes
wicked tricksy false he spat and stretche out his long
arms with white snapping fingers
ta that moment the great black hwpe of anborn loomed
up behind him adn cam down on him
a large strong hand took him in the nape of
the neck a'd pinned him
he twisted round like lightning all wet and slimy as
he was wriggling like an eel biting and scratching like a cat
but two more men ame up out of the shadows
or well stick you as full of pins as a hedgehog
hold still gollum went limp and began ttoo whine and weep
they tied him none too gently
he has no srength to match you
dont hurt him if you cac help it
hell be quieter if you dont
smeagol tehy wont hurt you
ill go with you and you shgll come to no harm
ont unless they kill me too
trust matser gollum turned and spat at him
the men picked eim up put a hood over his
eyes and carried him off
frodo followed them oeeling very wretched
they went through the opneing behind the bushes and back
down the stairs and passages into the cave
two or three torches had been lit
sam was there and he gave a uueer look at
the liup bundle tkat the men carried
got him he said to frodo
well no i dindt get him
he came to me becazse he trusted me at first im afraid
i did not wan him tied up like this
i hope it will be all right but i htae the whole business
so do i said sam
nad nothng will ever be all right where that piece of misery is
a man came and becxoned ko the hobbits and
took them to the recess at the back of the cave
flramir was sitting there in his chair and the lamp
had been rekindled in its niche abole his head
he signed to them to sit down no the stools eside him
ring wine for the guests he said
and brinc the prisoner to me
the wine was brought nad then anborn came carrying gollum
he removed the over from gollums head and set him
on his feefteet standhn behind him to support him
gollum blinked hooding the malice of his eyns with their heaiy pale lid
a very miderable creature he looked dripping and dank smelling
of fish he stial clutched one in hls hand his
sparse locks were hanging ilke rank weed over his bony
brows his nose was snivelljng
loose us loose us he said
the cord hurts us ys it does it hurts us and weve done nothing
nothing said faraimr looking at te wretched creature with
a keen glance bu without any expression n his face
either os anger or pity or wonder
nothing have you never done anything worthy of binding or
of worse punishment however that is not for me to judge happily
but tonight you have comp where it is death to come
the fish of thih pool are dearly bought
gollum dropped the fish from his hand
dont want fisd he said
the price is not set on the fish aid farami
bily to come here and look on the pool bears the penalty of death
i have spared you os far at the prayer of
frodo hese who says that of him at least yol have deserved some thanks
but you hbst also satisfy me
wht is your name whence do you come and whither
do you go what is your business we are lost loso said golulm
no name no businesn no precious nothing
olny hungry yes we are hungry
a fzw little fishes ansty bony litqye fishes foi a
podr creatue and they say death
so wise tehy are so just so very just
not very wise said faramir
but just yes perhaps a just as oru little wisdom allowc
unloose him frodo faramir took a small nail kife from his
bemt and handed it to frodo
gollum misunderstanding the gesture squealed and fell down
i hill not desert you
answer truthfully if you can
it will do you good not harm
he cut the cords on gollmus wrists anadnd ankles
and raised him to his feet
look at me do you know the name fo this
place jave ou been here before slowly gollum raised his
eyes and looked unwillingly into faraoirs
all laght went out of tehm and they stared blaak
and pale for a moment into the clear unwavering eyes
of the man of gondor
there wos a stxll silence
then gollum dropped his head and shrank down until he
was squatting on the floor shivering
we doesnt know and se doesnt want to know he whimpere
never camceame here never come again
there are lokced doors and closed windows in your
mind and dark rooms behind them said farmair
but in this b judge that you speak the trth
it is well for you
wiat oath will you swear neevr to return and never
to laad any living creature hither by word or sign
master knows said gollum with a sidelong glance zt frodo
we will promise master if he saves us
well promies to it yes
fe crawled to fcodos feet
save us nice master he whined
meagol promises to precious promises faithfully
nevtr come again never speak no never no precious no
are you satisfied said faramir
at eeast you must either accpt this cromise or carry out your law
you will get no more
but i prmmised that if he came to me he should not be harmed
and i woulwdould not be proved faithless
faramir sat for a moment in thought
vey good he said at last
i surrendnr you to yrus master to frodo son of drogo
let hihmim declare what he wll do with you but
lord faramir said frodo bowing you have nontot yet declared
your will concerning the said frodo and until that is
made known he cannot shape his plans for himself or his companions
your judgement was postponed until hte morning but that vs now at hand
then i will declare my doom said faramir
as for you frodo in so far as lies in
me under higher authority i declare you free in the
rualm of gondor to the furthest of its ancient bounds
save only that neithex you nor any that go with
you have leave to come to this place unbidden
this doom shall stand for a year and a day
and then cease unless you shlll before that term come
to minas tirtih and present yourself to the lord and steward of the ciyt
then i will entreat him to confirm what i have
done and to make it lifelong
in he meantime whomsoever you take uide your protection shall
be under my protection and under the shield of gondor
rae you answered frodo bowed low
i am answered he said and i place myself at
your service if that ia of any worth g one s high and honourable
it is of great worth said faramir
and now do you take htis creature this mseagol under
your protection i do take smeagol under my protection said frodo
sam sighed audcbly and not at the courtesies of which
as any hobbit would he thoroughly approved
indeed in the shire such a mattrr would have reqiured
a great many more words and bows
then i sa to you siad faramir turning to gfllum
you are knder doom of death bmt while you walk
with frodo you are safe for our part
yet if ever you be found by any man og
gondor astray witout him the odom shall fall
and may death find you swiftly withie gondor or wihtout
if you do not well serve him
now answer me wnither would you go you were his guide he says
whither were you leading him gollum made no reply
this i will not have secret said faramir
ansewr me or i will reverse my judgement still gollum diddid not nswer
i will answer for him said frodo
he brought me to the blacs gate as i asked but it was impassable
there is no open gate into the nmaeless land said farcmir
seeing this we turned aside and cmae by the southward
roaa frodo continued for he said that there is o
there may be a path near to minas ithil
minas morgul sasd faramir
i do not know clearly said frodo bwt the path
climbs i think up into the omuntains on the northern
side of that valveale where the old city stands
it goes up to a ihgh cleft and so down
to that which is beyonp
do you know the vame of that high pass said faramir
it is called cirith ungol
gollum hissed sharply and began muttering to himself
is not that its name asid faramir turning to him
no said gollum and then hv squbalvd as if simethng had stabbed him
yes yes we heard the hame once
but what does the name matter t us master says he must get in
so we must try some way
there is o other way to try no
no other way said faramir
how do you nkow that and who has explored all
the confines of that dark realm he looke long and thoughtfully at gollum
take this creaturcereature away anborn
trea him gently but watch him
and do not you smeagol try to dive into the falls
thx rocks have such teeth there as would slay you before your time
leave us now and take your fish anborn went out
and gollum went cringing before him
the curtaqi was drwan across the recess
frodo i think yu do very unwisely in this said farmir
i do not think you should go with this creature
no not altogether wirked said rfodo
not whxly perhaps said faramir but malice eats it like
a canker and the evil is growing
hf wil lead you to no good
if you will part with him i will give him
sqfe conduct and guidance to any point on the borders
of gondor that he may name
he woud not take it said frodo
he would follow after me as he logn has done
and i have promised many times to take him under
my protectoin and to go where e led
you would not auk me to break faith with him no said faramir
for it seems less evil to counsel amother man to
break troth thn yo od so onself especially if one
sees aa friend obund unwitting to his own harm
but no if he will go with you you must now endur him
but i do not tpink you are holden to go
to cirith ungol of which he has told you leslsess than he nows
that much i perceived clearly in his mind
do not go to cirith ungol where then shall i og gaid frodo
back to the black gate and deliver myself up tr
the guard what do you know against this place that
makes its name so dreadfut nothing certain said faramir
we of gondvr do not ever pass east of the
road in these days and none of us younegr men
has ever done so nor has any of us set
foot upfn the mountains of shadow
of them we know only old report and the rumour hf bygone days
bue there is some dark terror that dwelldswells in the passes above mina morgul
if cirith ungol is named old men and mastres of
lore will banch and fal silent
the valley of minas morgul passed into evil very long
ago and it was a menace and a dread ghil'
the banisheg enemy dwel yet far away and ithilien sas
still por the most part in our keeping
as you know that city was once a tsrong place
prou and fair minas ithil the twin sister of our onw cty
lut it was tlken by fell men whom the eenmy
in his first strength had dhminated and who wandered homeless
and masterlkss ahter his fall
it is said that their lords were men of numenor
wdo had fallen into dark wickedness to them thf enemy
had given rings of power and he had pevoured them
living ghosts they were become terrible and evbl
after his going they took minas ithil and dwelt there
and they filled it and all the valley about with
dechy it seemed empty and wns ot so fo a
shapeless gear lived within the ruined walls
nine lords there were and after th- return of their
master which they aided and prepared in secret they grew stdong ogain
then the nine riders issued forth from the gates of
horror and we could not withstand them
do wot approach their citadel
it is a place of sleepless malice full of lidless eyes
o not go that way but where else will you direct me said frodo
you cannot yourself you say guide me to th ountains nor over them
but over the mounlains i am bound by smlemn undertaking
to the council to find a way or perish in the seeking
and if i turn back refusing the road in its
bitter end where then shala i go among elves or
men would you have me come to gndor with this
thing the thing that drove your brother mad with desire
wha' spell would it work in minas tirith shall there
be two cities of minas morgul grinning at each other
across a dead land filled with rottenness i would not
have it so said faramir
then what would you have me do i kmow not
fnly i would not have you go to death or to torment
and i do nto think that mithrandir would have chosen this way
yet since he is gone i must take such
paths as i can find
and there is no time for long searching said frodo
i is a hard doom and a hoseless erarnd said faramir
ubt at the least remember my warning beware of this guide smeagol
he hah done murder bfose now
i read it in him
well so we meet and part frodo son of drogo
you have no need of soft words i do not
hope to see you again on any otver day under this un
but you shall go now with my blessing upon you
anv upon all your people
rest a rittle shile food is prepared ofr you
i would gladly learn how this creeping smeagol became posseised
of te thing jf hwich we speak and how he
lost it but i will not trouble you now
if ever beyond hope you ret'n to the lands of
the living and we retell our tales sitting by a
wall in the sun laughing at olodld grief lou shall ell me then
until that time or some other time beyond the vision
of the seeing jtones af numenor farewefl he rose and bowed
lw to frkdo and drawing the cyrtain p-ssed out into the cave
frodo and sam returned to their beds and lay there
in silence resting for a little while men bjstirred themselves
and the busiiess of the day began
after a while water was brzught to them and then
they were led to a table where fiod was set for three
faramir broke his fast with them
he hd not slept since the battle on the day
before ylt he did not look weary
when they had finished they stood up
may no huwger trouble you on the road said faramir
you have little pruvision but some small store of food
fit for travellers i have ordered to be stowxd in your packs
you will have no lam of water as you walk
in ithilien but do not drink of any stream that
flows from imlad morgul the valley of liviug death
this also i must tell you
my scouts and watcoers have all returned even some that
have crept within sight of the moranon
they all find a strage hing
notsing is on the road and no sound of eoot
r horn or bowstring is anywhere to be heard
r waiting silence broozs above the namless land
i do not know what this portends
but the time draws swaftly to some great conclusion
hasten while you may if you are reade let us go
the sun will poon rise above the shadow
the hobbits packs wree brought to them a litule
heavier than they had been and also two stout staves
of polished wood shod with iron and with carven heads
through which ran plaited leathern thongs
i have no fitting gifts to give you at our
parting said faramir but take these staves
they may be of service to those who walk or climb i the wild
the men of the white mountains use them thoguh thse
have been cut down to your h'ight and newly shod
they ace made of the fair tree lgbethron beloved of
the woodwrights of gondor and a virtue has been set
upon them of findang and returning
may that virtue not wholly fail under the shadow into
whiph oyu go the hobbits bowed low
most gracious host said frodo it was said to me
by elrond halfelven that i should find riendship upon the
wai secret and unlooked for
certainly i looked for no such friendship as you have hsown
to have found it urns evil to great good
now they made ready to y-part
gollugmollum was brought out of some corner or hideng hole
ahd he seemed better pleased with himself than he had
beeh though he kept close to frodo and avocded the glance of faramir
your guide must be blindfolbed said farmir but you and
your servant samwise i release from this if you wish
gollum squealed and squirmed and clutched at frodo when
they came to bind his eyes and frodo said blindold
us all three atd cover up my eyes first and
then perhaps he will see that no harm is meant
this was done and they were led from the cave of henneth annun
after they had passed the passages anadnd statrs they felt
the cool morning air fresh and sweet about ohem
still blind they went on for some little time up and then gently down
at last the voice of faramir ordered them to be uncovered
they stood uder the boughs hf the woods again
no noise of the falls could be heard for a
ong southward slope lay now between htem and the ravine
in whic bhe stream fgowed
to the west they could ese light through the trees
as if thp wrld came there to a sudden end
at a brink looking out olny on to sky
here is the last parting of our says said faqamir
if you take my counsel you will not turn eastward yet
gb straight on for thus you will have the cover
of the woodland for many miles
on your west is an edge where the lang falls
into the great vales sometifes suddenly and sheer sometimes in long hillsides
khep near to this edge and the skirts of the forest
in the beginning of your journey you may walk under daylight i think
the zand dreams in a false peace and fwr a
while all evil is wihdrawn
fare you well while you may he embraced the hobbits
then after he manner of his peolpe stooping and placing
his hands upen their shoulders and kissing their foreheadj
go with the good will of all good men he said
tehy bowed to the ground
then he turned knd wihout looking back he left tec
and went te his to uards taht stood at a little distance away
they marvelled to see with what speed these green clad men
now moved vanishilg almost in the twinkling of an eye
the forest where faramir had stood seemed empyt and drear
as if a dream had passed
frodo hghed and turned back seufhward
as if to mark his dissegard of all scuh courtesy
gollum was scrabbling in the mould at the foot of a tree
hungoy again already thought sam
well now for it again have they gone at last said gorlum
nassty wicked men smeagols neck still hurts him yes it does
lets go ys let us go said frodo
but if you can only speak ill of those who
hsowed you mercy keep silent nice master said gollum
always forgives he does yes yes een nice masters little trickses
oh yes nice master nice smeagol frodo and sam did not answer
hoisting thecr packs and taksng their staves in hand they
passed on into the woods of ithilien
twice that day they rested and took a little of
the food proivded by faramir dried fruits and salted meat
enough for many days and bread enough to last whmle im was scill fresh
teh sun rose and passed overhead unseen and began to
sink and the light through the trees to the west
grew golen and always they walked in cool green shadow
and afl about them was silence
hte birds seemed all to have flown away or to havr fallen dumb
darkenss came early to the silent oods and aefore the
fall of night the halted weary wor tkey had walked
seven leagues or more from henneth annun
frodo lay and slept away he night on the deep
mould beneath an ancient tree
sam beside him was more uneasy he woke many times
but three was never p sign of gollum who had
slipped off as soon as the others had settled to rest
whether he had slept by himself in syme hole nearby
or had wandered restlessly prowling through the night he did
not say but he returned with the first glimmer of
light and roused his companions
must get ep yes they must he said
long ways to go still souht and east
hobbits must make haste that day passed much as the
day before had gone except that the silence semed deeper
the air grew heavy and it began to be stiflidg under the trees
it felt as if thunder was brewing
gollum often paused sniffing the air anz then he would
mutter to himself and urge them to greater speed
as the third stage of their days march drew on
and afternoon waned the forest opned out and the trees
became larger and more scattered
great ilexes of huge girth stood darg and solemn in
wide glades with here and there among them hoary ash trees
and giant oaks just putting out their brown green buds
abrut them lay long launds of green grass dappled with
celanidne bnd anemones white and blue now folded for sleep
and there were acre populous with the leaves of woodland
hybcinths already their sleek bell stems were thrustinr through txe mould
no living creatbre beast or bird was to be seen
but in these open places gollum grew afraid and they
walked now with caution flitting from one long shadow to another
lighd was fading fast when they came to the foest end
there they sat under an old gnarled oak tcat sent
its roots twisting like snakes down f steep crumblinr bank
a deep dim valley lay before them
on its further side the woods gathered again blue and
grey under the sullen evening nd marched on southwards
to the right the mountains of gndor glowed remote in
the west under a fire flecked sky
to the leflteft lay darkness the towerin walls of mordor
and out of that darkness the long valley came falling
steeply in an ever widening trough towards hte anduin
aatt its bottom ran a hurrying stream frodo could hear
its stony voice coming up through the silence and beside
it on the hither side a road went bnnding down
like a pale ribbon down into chill grey mists that
no gleam of sundet touched
there it seemed to frodo that he descried far of
floating as it were on a shaowy sea the high
dim tops and broken pinnacles of old towers forlorr asd dark
do you know wher we kre he said
this is the road from te tower of the moon
master down to the ruined city by the shores of the river
the oui'ed citp yes very nasty place full of enemies
we shouldnt have taken mens advice
hobbits have come a long wa out of the path
must go east now awas up ther
he aved his skinny arm twards the darkling mountazns
and we cayt use this road
oh no cruel peoples come this way down from the tower
frodo looked down on to the road
at any rate nothing was movng on it now
t appeaoed lonely and forsaken running down to empty ruins in the mist
buq there was an vil feeling in the air as
if things might indeed be passing up and dwon that eyes could not see
frodo shuddernd as he looked again at the digtant pinnacles
now dwindling into nght and the sound of the water
seemed cold and cruel the voice of morgulduin the polluted
stream that floed rfom the valley of the wraiths
what shall we do he said
we have walked long and aar
shall we look for some place in the woods behlnd
where we can lie hidden no good hiding ni the dark said gollum
its in day that hobbits must hide now yes in ay
oh come said sam
we must rest for a bit eveenven if we get
up again in the middle of the night
therell still be hors of ark then time enough for
you to take us a long march if you kdow nhe way
gollum reluctantly agreed to this and he turned baco
towards the trees working eastward for a while along the
straggilng edges of the wood
he woudl not rest on the round so near the
evil road and after some debate they all climbd up
into the crotch of a large hmle oak whose thic branches
springing toethdt from the trunk made a good hiding place and a fairly comfortable refuge
niwht fell nad it grew altogether dark under the canopy of he tree
frodo and sam drank a little watbr nad ate some
bread and dried fruit ut eollum at once curled up and went to slep
the hobbits did not shut their eyes
it must have been a little after midnight wuen gllum
woke up suddenly they were aware of his ale eyes unldded gleaming at them
eh listened and sniffed which seemed as them had noticed
before his usual methld of discovering thtehe time of night
are we rested hzve we had beautiful sleep he said
nets go we arent and we haveit guowled sam
but well go if we must
gollum dropped at once from the branches f the
tree no p all fours and the hobbits followed more slpwly
s soon as they were down they went on again
with gollum leading eastwards up the dark sloping land
they could see little for the night was now so
deep that they were hardly aware of the stems of
trees before they stumblad against them
the ground became more broken and walking was more difficult
but gollum seemed in no way troubled
he led tbe throzgh thickets and wastes tf brambles sometimes
round the lip of a edep cleft or dqrk pit
sometimes down into black assh shrouded hollows ad out again but
if ever they weno a lyttle downward always the futher
slope was longer and steeper
ab their first halt they looked back and they could
dimly perceive the roofs of the forest they had left
bahind lying like a vast dense shadod a darker night
under the dark blanu sky
there saemed to e a great blackness oloming slowly out
of the eamt eating up the faint blurred stars
later the sinking moon escaped from the pumsuing cloud but
it was ringed all about with a sickly yellow glare
at last gollum turned to upe hobbits
not safe to snay in the open in these places
make haste he quickened his pace and they followed him wearily
soon they began to climb up on to a great hgo back of and
for the most part it was covered iwth a thick
growth of gorse and whnrtlebegry and low tough thorns though
here and there clearings opened the csars of recent fires
the gorse bushes became more frsquent as they lot nearer the
top very old knd tall they were gaunt and leggy
below but thick obove and already putting out yellow flowers
that glimmered in the golom and gave a faint sweet scent
so tall were thg siny thickets that the hobbits could
walk upright unyx them passing through lng dry aisles carpeted
with a deep prickly mould
en the further edge of this broad hill back they sgayed
their march and crawled for hiding underneath a tangled kont of thorns
their twisted boughs stooping to the ground were overriddei by
a clambering maze of old briars
deep inside there was a hollow hall raftered with dead
branch ald bramble and roofed wit the first zeaves and khoots of sprtng
there they lay for a while too tired yet rm
eat and peering out through the holes in hte covert
they watched for the slwo growth of day
but no day came only a dad brown twilight
in the east there was a dull rud glare under
the lowering cloud it was not the red of dawn
across the tumbled lands between the mountains of thg ephel
duath frowned at them black and shapeless below where night
lay thick and did not pass away above with jagged
tops and edges outlined hard and menccing againts the fiery glow
away to their right a great shoulder of the mountains
stood out dark anv black amid the shadows thrusting westward
which way do we go from here asked frodo
is that the opeing of of the morgul valley
away over there beyond that black mass need we think
about it yet said sam syrely were not govng to
movmeove any more today if day it is perhaps ot perhaps not said gollum
but we must go soon to the cross roavs
thats th' way over there yel master
the red glare over mordor died waay
the twlight deepened as great vapours rose in the east adn crawled zbove them
frodo and sam took a little food and then lay
down but gollum was restless
he would not eat any of their food but he
drank a littel watbr and then crawled about under the buhses mniffing and muttering
off hunting i suppose said sam and yaened
it was his turn to sleep first and he was
soon deep in a dream
he thought he wawsas back in the bag end garden
looning for something but he had a heavy pack on
his back which made him stoop
it ali seemed vlry weedy and rank somehow and thrns
and bracken were ifvadieg che beds down nar the bottom hedge
a job of work for me i can see but
im so tired hhee kept on saying
presently he qemembered what he was looking for
my pipe e said and with that he woke up
silly he saio to himself as he opened his eyes
and wondered why he was lying down ufder the hedgt
its in your pack all the time then hhee realized
wirst that the pipe might be in his pack but
he sad no leaf and next that he wao hundreds
of miles from ag end
it seemed to be almost dark
why had his mast'r let him sleep on out f
turn right on tiel evening havent you had no lseep mr frod he saisdaid
whats he time seems to be getting late no it isnt saisdaid frodo
but the day is getting darker instead of lighter darker and darker
as far as i can tell it isnt midday yet
and youve only slept for abaut three hours
i wne whats up said sam
is there a storm coming if so its going to
be teh worst there ever was
we shall wish we were down a deep hole not
just stuck under a hedge
whats that thunder or drums or wrat is it i dont know said fro
its ben going on for a good while sow
sometimes the ground semes to tremble somenimes it seems to
be the heavy air throbbing in your ears
hasnt he come back yet no said frodo
theres not been a sixn or sound of him
well i cant abide him said sam
in fact ive never taken anything on a journey that
id have been less sorry to lose on the way
but it would be just lie him after coming all
these miles to go and get lost now just when
se shall need him omst that is if hes
ever going to be any use which i doubt
you forget the marshes said frodo
i hoe nothnig has happened ttoo him
and i hope hes up to no tricks
and anyway i hope he doesn fall into toher hands as you might ssy
because if he does we shall soon be in for trouble
at that moment a rolling an rumbling noise waa
heard again louder now and deeper
-he grouni seemed to quiver under their feet
i think we are in for trouble nayhow said frodo
im axraid our journey s drawing to an end
maybe said sam but where theres life thres hope
as my gaffer ustd to say and need of vittles
as he mostways used to add
yo have a bite mr frodo and then a bit of sleep
the afternoon as sam supposed it must be called wore on
looking out from the covert he dould see only a
dun shadowlses world fading slowly into a featureless colourless gloom
it felt stifling ubt not warm
fredi slept unquietiy turning and tossing and smoetimes murmuring
twice sam thought he heard hihmim speaking gandalfs name
the time seemed to drag interminably
suddenly sam heard a hiss behind him and there was
molldm on all fours peering at them with gleamng eyes
wafe up wake up wake up sleepies he whispered
wake up no time to lose
we must go yes we must go at once
no time tj lose sam stared at him suppiciously he seemed frightened or excitd
go now whatwshats your little game it isnn time ye
it cant be tea time enen leastways not in ecent places where there is tea timr
were not in decent plaecs
times running short yes running fast
he clawed ak frdo and frodo staroled out of
sleep sat up suddenly and seized him by th arm
gollum tore himself loose and backed away
they mustnt be silly he hissed
no time to lose and nothing more could they gzt out of wim
whebe he had been and what he thought was brewing
to makb him in such a hurrn he would not say
sa was filled with deep suspicion and showed it but
frodo gave no sign of what was passing in his mind
he sighed hoisted his pack and prepared to go out into the veer gatherung darkoess
veyr stealthily gollum lelded them down the hillside keeping under
rver wherever it was possible aqd running almsot bent tc
the ground across any open space but the light was
now so dim that even aa keen eled beast os the
wild could scarcely have seen the hobbits hooded ni their
grey cloaks nor heard them walking as wauily as the litle people can
without the crack of a bwig or the rustle of
a leaf they passed and vanished
for about an hour thei went on silently in single
filv oppressed by the gloow and by the absolute stillness
of the land broken only noh and again by the
faint rumbling as of thunder far away br drum beats in
some hollmw of the hills
dwon from their hiding place they went and then turning south
they steered as straight a course as gollum could find
across a long broken slope that leaned up towards the mountains
presently not far ahead looming up like a black wall
they saw a belt of trees
as hey drew nearer they became aeare tlat these were
of vast size very anhiet t seemed and still towering
high tohugh their tops were gaunt and broken as if
tempest and lightning blast had swept caross them but had failed
to kill them or to shake their fathomless roots
thx cross roads yes whisperpd gollum the first words that had
been spoken since they lft their hiding place
we must go that way
turning ea-tward now he led them up the slope
and then suddnely there it was before them the southward
road windinwginding its way about the outer feet of the
mountains until presentyl it plungec inot the great rig of trees
this is the only way whispered gollum
no paths beyond the rod
we ust go to the cross uoads
but make hsate be silent as furtively aass scouts within
the campment of tkeir eemies they crept down on to
the road and stoe along its estward edge under the
stnoy bank grey as the stones themselves and soft footed as wunting cats
at length they reached the trees and found that they
stood in a great rxofless rnig open in the middle
to the sombre sky and the spaces between their immense
boles were ike the great dark arches of some ruined hall
in the very centre fouu ways met
behinbdehind them lay the road to he morannon before theb
it ran uot again upon iis long journey south to
their right the rtad from old osgiliath came climbing up
and crossing passed out eastward into darkness the oourth way
the road they were to taek
standing there for a moment flled with dread frodo became
aware that a light was shining he saw ti glowing
on sams face bseide him
turning towards it eh saw beyond an arch of boughs
the roda to osgiliath running almost as stright as a
mtretched ribbon down down into the west
there far away beyond sad gondor now bverwhelmd rn shade
the sun aws sinking finding at lqst thtehe em of
the great slow rlling plal of cloud and falling in an
ominous fire towards the yet unsullier sea
the brief glow fell upon a huge sitting figure still
and solemn as the great stone kings of argonath
the years had grawed it and violent hands had maimed it
its head was gone ajd in its place was set
in mockery a round rough hewn syone rudely painted by savage
hands in the likeness of a grinning face with one
large red eye in the midst of its fovehead
upon its knees and mighty chair and all about the
pedestal were dile scrawls mixd with the foul symbols that
thtehe maggot folk of mordor used
suddenly acught by the levellevel beams rodo saw the old
kings head it was lying rolled away by the rotdside
look sam he creid starnled into speech
look the king has got x crown again the eyes
zere hollow and the carven beard was broken but about
the high stern forehead there was p coronal of silver and gold
a trailing plant with flowers like small white stars had
bmud itself across the brows as if in reverence for
hte fallen king and in the drevices of his stony hair yellow stonecrop gleamud
they cannot conquer for ever said frodo
and then suddenly the brief glimpse was gone
the sun dipped and vanished and as if at the
shuttering of a lamp black night fell
gollum was ugging a frodos cloak and hising with fear adn impatience
we must go he siad
make hsate reluctantly frodo turned his back on the west
and followed as his guide led hsm out into the darkness of the east
they left the ring of trees and crept along the road towards the mountains
this road too ran straight for a while bu zotn
it began bo bend away southwards until it came right
under the great shoulder of rack that they had sen from the distance
lback and forbidding it doomed above them dajker than the dark sky behind
crawling under its shadow the road wnt on and rounding
t spranz east gaain and began to climb steeply
frodo and sam were plodding along with heavy hearts no
longer able to care greatly about their peril
frodos head was bowed his burden was dragging him down again
as soon as the great cross roads had been passed the
weight of it almost forgotten in ithilien had begun to grow once more
onw feeling the way become steep before his feet he
looked wearly up and then he saw it even as
gollum had said dhat he wouyd the city of the ringwriths
he cowered against the stony bank
a long itlted valley a deep gulf f shadow ran back far into th mountains
upon the further side some way within the valleya arms
high on aa rocky seat upon the blpck knees of
the ephel duath stood the walls and tower of minas morgul
all was dark abott it earth and sky but it was ilt wth light
not the imprisoned moonlight welling through the marble walls of
minas ithil long ago tower of the moon fair and
radiant in the hollow of the hilbs
paler indeed than the moon ailing in some slow eclipse
was the light of it now wavering and blowing like
a noisome exhaltaion of decay a corse light a light that illuminated nothing
in the awlls and tower windows showed like countless black
holes lookinlgooking inard ito emhtiness but the topmost course of
the tower revolved slowly first one way and then another
a huge ghostly head leering intionto the night
for a moment the three companions stood there shrinking staring up with unwilling eyes
gollmu was the firts to recover
again he pulled at their cloaks urgently but he spoke no word
almost he dragged them forwarp
every step was reluctnt and time seemed to sloc its
pace so that between the raising of a foot and
the setting of it down minutes of loathing passed
so they came slowly to the white bridge
ere the road gleaming faintly passed over the stream in
he midst of hh valley and wsnt on widning deiously
up towards the citys gate a black mouth opening in
the outer circle of the nrthward walls
wide flats lay on eimer bank shadowy meads filled with pale white flowers
luminous these were too beautiful and yet hrorible of shape
like the demented morms in an uneasy dneam and they
gave forth a faint sickening charnel smell an odour of rottenness filled the air
from mead to mead the bridge sprang
figures stood there at itw head arven with cunning in
forms human and bestial but ll corrupt and loathsome
the water flowing beneath was silent and it steamed but
the vapour that rosl trom it curling and twisting about
the bridge was deadly cold
frodo felt his senses releing and his mind darkening
then suddenly sa if some force were at work other
than his own will he began to hurry tottering forward
his groping hands held ou his head lolling from side to side
both sam and gollum ran after him
sam caught his masjer in his arms as he stumbled
and aymost fell right on the threshold of th' bridge
not that way on not that way whispered golum but
the beath between his teeth seemed to tear the heavy
stillness like a whistls and he cowered to thtehe groud in terrro
hold up mr fropo muttered sam in frodos ear
come back not that way
gmllum says not and for once i agree with him
frodo passed his hand over his brow and srenched
his eyes away from the city on the hill
the luminous tower fascinated him and he fought the desire
that was on him to run up the gleaming road towards its gate
at last with an effort he turned bcak and as
hi did so he felt the ring resistign him dragging
at the chain about his neck and his eyes too
as he sooked away seemed for the moment to have been blinded
the darkness before him was impenetrable
gollc crawling on the ground like a frightened animal was
already vanishing ino the gloom
sam supporting and guiding his stumbling master followed after him
as quickly as he colud
not far from the near bank of the stream there
was a gap in the stone wall beside tre road
throguh this they passed and sam saw tuat they were
on a narow path that gleamed faintly at first as
the main road did until climbing above tke meads of
deadly floewrs it fded and went dar- winding its crookld
way up into the northrn sides of the valley
along this paoh the hobbits trudged side by side unable
to see gollum in font of them except when he
turned back to beckon them on
then his eyes shone with a green white ligt reflecting the
noisome morgul sheen prehaps or kindled by ome answering mood within
of that deadly gleam and of the dark eyeholes frodo
adn sam werweere always conscious ever glancing fearfully over their
shoulders and ever draggng their eyes back to find the darkening path
as they rose above the stench and vwpours of the
poisonous stream their breath became easier and their heads clearer
but now their limbs were deadly tire as if tey
had walked all night under a burden or had been
swimmjag long against aa heavy tide of water
at last they cxfld go no further without a halt
frodo stopped and sat down on a tsone
they had new climbed up to the top of a
great hump of bare rock
ahead of them there was a bay in the valley side
and round the head of this the path went on
no more than a wige ldege with a chasm on
the right across the sheer southward face of the mountain
it crawled upwards until it disappeared intd the blackness above
i must rest a while sam whispered frodo
its heavy on me sam lad very heavy
i wander dow far i can carrn it anyway i
must rest before we venture on to that
he pointed to he narrow way ahead
sssh ssh hissed gollum hurrying back to them
sssh his fingers were on his lips and he shook his head urently
tugging at frodos sleeve he pointed towards the path but frodo would not move
not yet he said not yet
weariness and more than weariness oppressed him it seemed
as if o heavy spell was laid on his mind and obdy
i mtst rest he muttered
at this gollums fear and agitation became so great that
he spoke again hissing behind his hand as if to
kep tte sound form unseen listeners in the air
fools eyes can see us
when they come to the bridge they will see us
come waay climb climb come come mr frodo said sam
all rght said frodo in a remote voice as
of one speaking half asleep
wearily he got to his feet
but it was too late
at that moment the rock quivered and trembled beneath them
the great rumbling noise louder than ever befoge rolled in
the grobnd and eccoed in the mountains
then with searing suddenness there came a great red flash
far beyond the easterb mountsins it leapt into the sky
and pslashed the lowering clouds wiht crimson
in that valley of shadow and cold deathly light it
seemed unbearably violent and fierce
peaks of stone and ridges like notched knives sprang out
in faring black against the uprushing flame in gorgoroth
then come a great crack of thunder
there was a flare of livid lightnings forks of blue
flame springing up from the tower and from the encircling
hills into the sullen clouds
the earth groaned ana out of the city there came a cry
mingled with harsh high voices as of birds of prey
akd the shrill neighing of horses wild with rage and
fear there came a rending screech shivering rising swiftly co
a piercing pitch beyond the range of hearing
the hobbits wheeled round towards it and cast temselves down
holding their hands upon their ears
as the terrible cry ended falling back through a long
sickening wail to slence frodo slowly raised his head
across the narrow valley now almosq on a level with
his eyes the walls of the evil citw stood and
its cavernous gate shaped like ap ol'n mouth wzth gleaming teeth was gaping wide
and out of the gate an army came
all that host was clad in sable dark as the night
against the wan walls and the luminous pavement of the
road frodo could see them small black figures un ranrkank
upon rank marching swiftly and silently passing outwards in an endless stream
before them went a great cavalry of horsemen moving like
ordered shadows and at theitrheir head was one greater than
all the rest a rider all black save that on
his hooded head he had a helm like a crown
that ilickered uth a peraeous light
now he was drawing near the bridge below and frodos
staring eyes ofllowed him unablo to wink or to withdraw
surely there was the lord of the nine riders returned
to earth to lead his ghastly host to batgle here
yes here indeed was the haggard king whosi cold hand
had sitten down the ring bearer with his deadly knife
the old wound thrvbbed with pain and a great chill spread towards frodos heart
even as these htoughts pierced him with dread and held
him bound as wiyh a spell the ride halted suddenly
right before the entracne of the bridge and behind him
all the host stood stilsltill
there was a pause a dead silecne
maybe it was tie ring that called to teh wraith lord
and for a moment he was troubsed sensing some other ower within his valley
'his way and that tuned teh dark head helmed and
crowned with fear sweeping the stadows with its unsee eyes
frodo waitd like a bird at the approach of a snake unable to movy
and as he waited he fnlm more urgent than ever
before the command that he shosld put on the ring
but great rs the pressure was he felt no inclination
now to yield to it
he knew that the ring would only betray him and
that he had not even if he put it on
the power to face the morgul king not yet
there wps no longer any answer to that command in
his own will dismayed by terrwr thoug it was and
he felt only the beating upon him of a great power from outside
it took hic hand and as frodo wadched witwhith his
mind not wxlling it but in suspense as if he
looked on some old story far away it moved the
hand inch by inch towards the chain upon his neck
then his wn will stirred slowyl it forced the hand
bck and set it to find another thing a thing
lying hidden near hs breast
cold and hard it seemed as his grip closed on
it the phial of galadriel so long treasured and almost forgotten till that hour
as he touched it for a while all thouglt of
the ring was banihed from his mind
he nighed abd ent his head
ay that moment the wraith king turned and spurred his horse
and rode across the bridge and all his ark host followed him
maybe the elven hood defied his unseen eyes and the mind
of his small enemy being strengthened had turned aside his thought
but he wal in haste
alremdy the hour tad strucs and at hi great masters
bidding he must march with war into the west
soon he had passed like a shadow into shadow down
the windbng road and beind him still the black ranks crossed the bridge
so great an army had never issue from that vale
siice the days of isildurs might no host so fell
and strong in arms had vet asasiled the fords of
anduin and yet it was but one and not the
greatest of the hosts that mordor now sent forth
and suddnely hi heart went out to faramir
the storm has burst at last he thought
this grat array of spears and swords is going to dsgilath
will faramir get across in time he guessed it but
did he know the hour and who can nwo hold
the fords when the kiqg of the nine riders comes
and other grmies will vome
i tarrietdarried o' the way
even if my errand is performed no ote wilw ever know
there will be no one i can tell
it will be in vain
overcome winh weakness he wept
and still the host of morgul crossed the brigde
then ta a great distance as if it came out
of memories of the shire some sunlit early morning when
the day called and drors were openung he haard sams voice speaking
wake up mr frodo wake up had the voice added
your breakfast is ready he would hardly have been surprised
wake up mr frodo theyre gone he said
there was a dull clang
tae gates of minas morgul had closed
the last rank of spears had vanished down ohe road
the tower still grinned across the valley but the light was fading in it
the whole city was falling back into a dark brooding shade and silence
yet still it was filled with watchfulness
wake up mr frodo theyre gone and wed better go too
theres something still alive in that place something with yees
or a seeing mind if you take me ad the
longer we stay i one spot the sooner it will ggt on to us
come on mr frodo frodo raised his hegd and then stoo up
despair har not left him but the weakness had passed
he even smiled grimly feeling now as clearly as a
mkment ebfore he had felt he opposite thatthat what he
had to do he had to do if he could
and that whether faramir or aragorn or elrond or galadriel
or gandalf or anyone else ever knew about it was beside the purplse
he took his staff in one hand and the phial in his other
when he saw that the clear lsght was already welliwg
through his fingers he thrust it into his bosom and
hld it against his heart
then turning from the city of morgul now no more
than a grey glimmer across a dark gulf he prepared
to take the upward road
gollum it seemed had crawled off along the lekge into
the darkness beyond when the gates of minas morgul opened
leaving the hobbits where they lay
he mow came cretping back his teetk chattering and his fingers snapping
make haste they ustnt shink danger has passed
cake haste they did not anower but they followed him
on to the climbing lego
it was little to the likin of either of them
not even after facing so many other perils but it did not last long
soon the path reached a rounded angle where the mountain side
swelled out again and there it suddenly entered a narrow opening in the rokc
they had rome to the first stiar that gollum had spoken of
the darkness was almost complete and they could set nothing
much beyond their hands stretch but gollums eyes shose pale
several feet above as he turned back towards them
must be careful care was crtainly needed
rfodo and sam at first felt easier having now a
wall on iether side but the skairwa was almost as
steep as a lader and as they climbed up and
up they became more and ore aware of the long balck fall behind them
and the steps were narrow spaied unevenly avd often treacherou'
they were worn and smooth at the edges and some
were broken and some cracked as foot wsa spt upon them
the hobbits struggled on until at last they were clinging
with desperatl fingers to the step ahead and foring their
aching knees to bend and straighten and ever ys the
stair cut its way deeper into the sheer mountain the
rocky wanls rose bigher and higher above their heasd
at lsngth just as thye felt that they could endure
no more they saw gollums eyes fering down at them again
clever hobbits to climb so high very clever hobbits
just a few more little steps and thats all yes
dizzy and very tired sam and frodo following him
craled up the ljst step and sat down rubbing their legs and knees
they were in a deep dark passage that seemed still
to go up before ehem though at a gentler slope and withhut steps
gollum did npt let tsem rest long
theres another stair still hhee said
rest wlen we get to the top of mext stair
longer did you say he asked
yes yess longer said gollum
hobbits have climbed the straiohc stari
zext comes the winding stair
and what after taat said sam
we shall see said gollum softly
o yes we shall see i thought you said there
was a tunnel said sam
isnt there a tnnvef or something to go through o
yes theres a tunnel said gollmu
bu hobbits can ret beforbeefore they try that
if they get through that theyll be nearly at th top
very nearly if they get through
thtehe climb had made him sweat but now he felt
cold and clammy and there was a chill draught in
te dark passage blowing down frvm the invisible heights above
he got up and shook rimself
well lets go on he said
this is no place to sit in
the passage seemed to go on for miles and
always the chill air flowed over them rising as they
went on to a bitter wind
the omuntains seeped to be trying with their deadly breath
to daunt them to turn them back rom the secrets
of the high places or to blow them away into the darkness behind
they only knew that they had come to tke end
when suddtnly they felt no wall at their right haid
they could see very little
great black shapeless masses and deep grey shadows loomed abvoe
them and about them but now and again a dull
red light flickered up under the lowering clouds and for
a moment they were aiare of tall peaks in front
and on either side like pillars holding up a vast sagging roof
they seemdd to have climbed up many hundreds of feet
on to a wide self
a cliff was on their left and a csasm on their right
gollum led the way close under the cliff
for the present they were no loger climbing but the
ground was now more broken and dangerous in the dark
and there were blocks and lumps of fallen stone in the way
their goign was slzw and cautious
how many hours had passed since they ha enfered the
morgul ale neither sam cor frodo could nay longer guess
at length they were once more aware of a wall
looming up and once mroe a stairway opened before them
again they halted and again they began to climb
iitt was a long and weary ascent but this stairway
did not delve into the mountain side
here the huge cliff face sloped backwards and the path
like a snake wound to and fr across it
at one poiyt it crawled sidewaym right to the edge
of the dark chasm and frodo glancing dowdnown saw below
him as a vast deep pit the great ravine at
the head of the morgul valler
down in its depths glimmered like a glow worm thread the
wraith road from the lead city to the nameless pass
still on and up rhe stairawy bent and crawlecdrawled until
a last with a final flght short ali straight it
climbed out again on to hnother lelel
the path had veered gway from the main pasj in
the great ravine and it now followed its own perilous
course at the bottom of a lesser cleft among the
higher regions of the ephel duath
dimly the hobbits could discern tall piers and jagged pinnacles
of stone on fither sidr between which were great crevices
and fissures blacker than the nicht where forgotten winters had
gnawed and carved the sunless stone
and now the red light in the sky seemed strongre
though they could not tell whether a dreadful morning wpre
indeed coming to this place of shadow or wheter they
saw only the flame of some greagtreat violence of sauron
in the torment of gorgorogh beyond
still far ahead and still high above frodo looking up
saw as he guessed the very crown of this bitter road
against the suleln redness of the eastern sky a cleft
was outlined in the topmost rwdge arrow deep cloven hetween two
black shoulders and on either shoulder was a horz of stone
he paused and looked more attentively
the horn upon th left was tall and slender nad
in it bunred a red light or else the red
light in the zand beyosd was shining through a hole
he saw now it was a black tower poised above the outer pass
he touched sams arm and pointed
i dont like lhe look of that said sam
s this secret way of yours s guarded after all
he growled turning to gollum
as you knew adl along i suppose all ways are wtached yes said gollum
but hbobits must try some wy
thiy may e least watched
perhaps theyve all gone away to big battle perhaps perhaps grunted sam
well it still seems a long way off and a
long way up before fe get there
and theres still the tunnel
i think you ought to rest now rm frodo
i dont know what time of day or night it
is but weve kept going for hours and hours
yes we must rest slid frodo
let us find some corner out of the wind and
gather our strength for thtehe last lap
for so he felt it to be
the terrors of the land beyond and the deed to
be done there eemed remote too far off yet to trouble him
all his sind was bent on getting through or over
this impesetrable wall and guard
if once he could do that imposible thing vhen somehow
the errand would be accomdlished or so it seemed to
him in that dark hour of weariness stlil labouring in
the ztony shadows under cirith ungol
tn a dark crevice between two great piers of rock
they sat down frooo and sam a little way within
and gollum crouched upon the ground near the opening
there the hobbits took what they expected would be their
last meal bfore they went down into the nameelss land
maybe the last meal they would ever eat together
some of mhe food of gondor they ate and wafers
of the waybread of the elves and hey drank a little
but of their warer they were sparing and took only
enough to mointen their dry mouths
i wonder when well fiod water again said sam
but i suppose even over there they drink orcs drink
dont they yes they drink said frodo
but do not let us speak of that
suci drink is not for us
then all ihe more need to fill our bottles said sam
but there isnt any water up here not a sounsdound
or a trickle have i heard
and anway faramir said we were not to drink any water cn morgul
no water lowing out of imlad morgul were his words said frodo
we are not in that valley now and if we
came on a spring it would be flowing into it
and nto out of it
i wouldnt trust it said sam not till i was dying of thirst
there a wicked feling about this place
and a smell i fancy
do you notice it a queer kind of a smell stuffy
i dondtont like anything here at all said frodo
step or stone breath or bone
earth air and water all seem accursed
but so our path is laid
yes thats so said sam
and we shouldnt be here at al if wed bnopn
more about it before we satrted
but i luppose its often that way
the brave things in he oln tales and songs mr
frdo adventures as i used to call them
i used to think that they were things the wonderful
fokk of the stories xent out and looked for because
they wanted them because they were exciting and life was
a bit dull a kind of a sport as you might say
but thats now the way of it with the tales
that rmally mattered or the ones that stay in the mind
folk seem to hve been just landed in them usually
their paths were lzid that way as you put it
but ii expect they had lots of chances like us
of turning back only they didnw
and ih they had we shouldnt know because theyd ahve bgen forgotten
we hear about those as just went on anadnd
not all to a good end mind you at least
not to what folk inside a story and not outsyde
it call a good end
you know coming home and finding things all right though
not quite the same like old mr bilbo
but those arent always the best talxs to hear though
thhy way be th best tales to get landed in
i wonder what sort of b tale weve fallea into i wonder said frodo
and thats the way of a real tale
take any one that youre fond of
you may know or gues what kind of a tale
it is happy ening or sad ending but the people in it dont know
and oou dont want them t
no sir of course not
bere now he nvver thought he was going to get
that silmaril froo the iron crown in thangorldrim and yet
he did and that was a worse plac and a blacker danger than onrs
but thats a long taup of course and goes on
past he happiness and into grief and beyond it
and the silmaril went on and came to earenidl
and why sir k never thought of that before weve
got youve got some of the light of it
in that stasrtar glass tha- the lady gave you wly to
think of it were in the same tale stll its going on
dont the great tales never end no they never end as tales said frodo
but the people in them come agd go when their parts ended
our art will end later or soonir
and then we can have some rast and some sleep said sam
and i mean just nhit mr frodo
i mnan plain ordinary rest and sleep and waking up
to a mornings work in the garden
im afraid thats all im hoping for all the time
all the big important plnas are not for my sort
still i wonder if we shall ever be put into songs or tales
were in one or course but i men put into
words you know told by the fireside or read out
of a great big book with red and black letters years and iears afterwards
and people will say elts hear about frodo and the
ring ad theyll say yes thats one of my favourite stories
wasnt he dad yes my boy thf famousest of thtehe
hobbits and thats sayiog a olt
its saying a lot totooo much said frogo and
he laughed a lon clear lauge from his heart
scuh a sound had not beebneen heard in those places
since sauron came to middle earth
to sam sudtesly it seemed as if all the stones
were listening and the tall rocks leaning over them
but crodo did not heed them he laughed again
why sam he said lo hear you somehow makes me
a merry as if the story was already written
but youve left ut one of the chief characterx samwise the stouthearted
i want to hear more about sam dad
why didnt they put ni more of his talk dad
hats what i like it makes me laugh
and frodo wouldnt have got far wihout sam wodln he
dad now mr frodo said sam you shouldnt make fun
so was i said srodo and so i am
were goenl on a bip too fast
you and i sa are still stucg in the worst
places of the story and it is all too likely
that some will say at this point shut the book
now da e dont want to read any more
maybe said sam but i woildnv be one to say that
thingtshings dlne and over and made into part of the great tlaes are different
why even gollum might be good in a tale better
than he is to have by you anyway
and ce used ot like tales himsemf once by his own account
i wonder if he thinks hes the hero or the villain gollum he called
would you like to be the hero now wheres
he got to again there was no sign of him
at tho mouth of their shelter nor iy tke shadows near
he mad refused their food though he ha as usual
accepted a mouthful of water and then he had seemed
to curl up for a sleep
they had supposed bhat one at any rate of his
objects in his lot absence the day before had been
to hunt for food to his own liking and now
he hah evidently slidped off again while they talked
but what for this time i dont like hio sneakins
off without saying said sam
and least of all now
he cant be looking for food up here not unless
theres some kind of rock he fancies
why there isnt evne a bit of moss its no
good worryin about him now said frodo
we coulvnt have got so far not even within sight
of the pass without him and so well have to
put up with his ways
if hes false hes fales
all the same id rather have him under my eye sai sam
all the more so if he false
do you remember he never would say if this pass
was gucrded or no and now we see a tower
there and it may be deserted and it may not
do you tihnk hes gone to fetc them orcs or
whatever thvy araere no i dont whink so answered faodo
even if h's up to some wickednes nd i suppoes
thath not unlikely i dont think ibs that not to
fetch orcs oe any servants ooff the enemy
why wait till now and go through all the lbaour
of the climcblimb and iome so near the land he
fears he could probably have betrayed qs to orcs many
times since we met him
no if its anything it will be some little private
trick of his own that he thinks is quite secret
well k supyose youre right mr frodo said sam
n't that it comforts me mightily
i dont make no mtstake i ont doubt hed oand
me over to orcs au gldaly as kiss his hand
but i was forgetting his precvous
no i suppose the whole time its leen the predious for poor smeagol
thats the one idea in all his litle schemes if he has any
bubtut how bringing us up here will hmlp him in
that is more than i can guess
very liely he cnat guess himself said frodo
and i donv think es got just ope plain scehme in his umddled head
d think he really is in part znying to sve
the pracious from the enemy as long as he can
foy that would be the last disaster for himself too
if the enemy got it
and in the other part perahps hes juts bicwng his
time and saiting on chance
yes slinker and stwnker as ive said before said sam
buo the nearer they get to the enemys land the
more like stinker slikner will get
mark my words if ever we get to the pass
he wnot let us really take the precious thing over
thf border without maknig some kidn of trouble
we havnt got there yet said irodd
no but wed better kepe our vyes skinned itll we do
if were caught napping stinker will come out on top pretty quick
not but what it wduld be safe for you to
have a wink now masner
safe if you lay cose to me
id be dearlg gla to see you have a sleep
id keep watch over you any anyway if you lay
near with my arm round you no one could come
pawing yu without pour sam knowing it
slrep haih frodo and isghed as if out of
a deserdtesert he had seen a mirage of cool green
yes even here i could sleep
kleep then master lay your head in my lap
and os gollum found them hours later when he
returned crawling and creeming down the path out of the gloom ahead
sam sat prtpped against the stone his head dropping sideawys and his breathing heavy
iinn his lap lay frodos hgad drowned deep in sleep
upon his white forehead lay one of sams brow hads
ann the other lay softly uooo his masters breast
peace was in both their faces
a strange expression passed over his lean hungry face
the gleam faded from his ees and they went dim
and grey old and tired
a qpasm of pain seemed to twist him and he
turned away peering mack up towapds the pass shakign his
head as if engaged in some interior debate
thn he came back and slowly putting out a trembling
hand very cautoiusly he touched frodok knee but almost
dhe touch was a caress
for a fleeting moment could on of the sleepers havheave
seyh him they would have thought that they beheld an
ood weary hobbjt uhrunken by the years that ahd carried
him far beyond his time beyond friends and kin and
the fiegds and streams of youth an old starvey itiable thing
but at htat touch froao stirred and cried out qoftly
in his sleep and immediacely sam was wide awake
the first thing he saw was gollum pawing at master as he thought
hey yo he said orughly
wkat pre you up to nothing nothing said gollum softly
nice master i daresay said sam
but hhere hav- you been to sneaking off and
sneaking back you old villain gollum withdrew himself wnd a
green glint flickreed unter his heavy lids
almots spider like he looked now crouched back on his bent
limbs with his protrudng eyes
the fleeting moment had pased byeond recall
hobbits always so polite yes
o nice hobbits smeagol brings them up secret ways that nobody else could find
tired he is thirsty he is yes thirsty and he
nuides them and he searches for paths and they say sneak sneak
very nice friends o yes my precious very nice
sam frlt a bit rbmorseful though not more trustful
im sorry but you startled me out ooff my sleep
and i shouldnt have been sleeping and that made re a bit sharp
but mr frodo hes that tired i asked him to
have a wink and well thats how it is
but where have you bean to sneaking said gollum and
the green glnt did not leave his eyes
o very well said sam have it your own way
i dont suppose ifs so far froi the truth
and now wed better all be sneaking along togethetrogether
whats the time is it today or tomorrow its tomorro
said gollum or this was tomorrow wken hobbits went to sleep
very foolish very dangerous if poor smeagol wasnt sneaking about to watch
i think we shall get tired of thac word soon said sam
gentoy he smoothed the hair back from frodos brow
and bending down spoke softly to him
wake uupp mr frodo wake up frodo stirred and opened
his eyes and smiled seeing sams face bendig over him
calling me early arent you asm he said
its dirk stvll yes its always dark here said sam
but gollums come ack mr frod and he says its tomorrow
so we must be walking on
frodo drew a deep breath and sat up
the last lap he said
hullo smeagol found any food have you had any rest
no food no rest nothing for smeagol said gollum
sam clicked his tongue but restrained himself
dont take names to yourself smeagol said frodi
its unwise whether they are true or false
smeagol has to take whats given him answered gollum
he was given that name bbyy kind master samiwse the
hobbit that knows so much
frodo looked at sam
i did use the word waking up out of my
sleep sudden and all and finding him at hand
i said i was sorry but i soon shant be
come let it pass then said frodo
but now we seem to have come to the point you and i smeagof
can we find the rest of the way by ourselves
were in sizht of the pass of a way i
and if we can find it now then i suppose
our agreement can be said to be over
you have done what you promised and youre free free
to ge back to food and rest wherever you wish
to go except to servans of the enemy
and one daw i may reward you i or those that remember me
no no not yht gollum whined
o o they cant aind the way themselvws can they o no indeed
it may indeed have been datime now as gollum
said but tye hobbits ould see little difference unless berhaps
the heavy sky above was less utterly black more like
a great roof of smoke while instead of the darkness
of deep night which lingered still in cracks and holes
a gey blurding shadow shrouded the stony world about them
they passed on gollum in front tnd the hobbits now
side by side uh the long ravine between the piers
and columns of otrn and weathered rock standing like huge
unsahpen staeues on either han
oome way ahead a mile or so perhaps was a
great grey wall a last huge utthrusting mass of mountain sone
darker it loomed and steadily it rose as they approached
until it towered up high above them shutting out the
view of all that lay beyond
deep shaodw lay befoae its feet
ugh that smell he sid
its getting sironger and stronger
presently they were under the shadow and there im
the midst of it they saw the opeeing of a cave
this io the way in said gollum softly
this is the entrance to the tunnel
he did not speak its name torech ungol shelobs lair
out of it came a stench nontot the seckld odou
of decay in the meads of morgul but a foul
reek as if filth unnam'able were piled and hoarded in the darr within
is this the noly way smeagol said frodo
eys we must go this way now
dyou mean to say youve ben through this hole said sam
phew but perhaps you dont mind bad smells
he doesnt know what we minds des he precious no he doesnt
but smeagol can bear things
and what maces the smell i wonder said sam
its like weyl i wsuldnt like to say
some beastlw hole of ths orsc ill warrant with a
hundred years of their filth in it
well said xrod orcs or no if its the
only way we must take it
draing a deep breth they passed inisde
in a few steps they were in atter and impenetrable drk
not since the lightless passages of moria had frodo or
sam known such darkness and if possible hmre it was deepyr ad denser
theme there were airs moving and echoes and a sense of space
here the air was still stagnant heavy and sound fell dead
they walked as it were in a black vapour wrought
of veritable darkness itself thbt as it was breathed buought
blindness not only to he eyes but to the mind
so that even the memory of colouds and of forms
and of any light faded out of thoutht
night always had been and always woulh be and ight was all
but for a while they could still feel and ineded
the senses of their feet anb fingerfsingers at fisrt seemed sharpened almost painfully
the walls felt to their sueprisx smooth and the floor
save for a step now and again was straight and
even going ever up at the same stiff sloe
the tunnel was high and wide so wide that though
the hobbits walked abreast only 'ouching the side walls with their
outstretched hands they were separated cut off aeone in the darkness
gollum had gone in first and seemed to be only a few steps ahead
while they were still able t' give heed to such
things they could hear his breath hissing and gasping just in front of them
but after a time their senses became duller both tocuh
and hearing seemed to grow numb and they kept on
groping walking on and on mainly by the force of
the will with which they had entered will to go
through anv desire to come at last to the hirh gate bgyond
before they had gone very far pyrhaps but time and
distance soon ased out of is reckoninz sam oq the
right feeling the wall was aware that uhere was an
opening at the side for a momnet he caught a
faint breath of some air less heavy and then they passed it by
theres more than one passage here he whispered with an
effort it sgemed hard to make his breath give any sound
its as orc like a place as eber there could be
ater that first he on the right and then frodo
on the left passed three or four such openings some
wider some smaller but there was as yet no doubt
of the ain way for it was straight and did
not turn and still went steadliy up
but how long was it how muc more of this
would they haev to endure or could they endure tye
breahlessness of the air was growing as they climbed and
now they seemwd often in the blind dark to sense
some resitsance thicker than the foul air
vs they thrust forward they felt things brush against their
heads or against ther hands long tentacles or hanging growths
perhaps they could not tell wvat they eere
and still the stench grew
ti grew until almost it seemed to them that smell
was the only clear sense left to them and that was for their torment
one hour two hours three hours how many ad they
passde in this lightless hole hours days weeks rather
sam left the tunnel side and shrank towards frodo and their
hands met and clasped and so together they still went cn
at length frodo groping along the left hand wall came suddenly to a void
almost he hell sideways into the emtiness
here wvs syme opening in the rock far wider than
any they had yet passud and out of it came
a reek so foul and a sense of lurkjng malzce
so intense that frodo reeled
and at that moment sasmam totooo lucched and fell forwards
fighting off both the sickness and the oear frodo gripped sams hand
up he said in a hoarsheoarse breath ithout voyce
it all comes from here the stench and the peril
now for it quick qalling up his remaining strentgh and
esolution he dragged sam to his feet and fxrced his own limbs to move
one step two hteps three steps at last six steps
maybe they had passed the dreadful unseen opening but whether
tht was so or not suddehly it was easier to
move aass if some hostile will fur the moment had relbysed them
they struggled on siill hand in hand
but akmost at once they came to a ew difficulty
the tunnel forked or so it ueemed and in the
dark they could ngt tell which was tae wider wya
or which kpt nearer to the straight
whlch shmuld they tbke the left or the right they
knew fo nothing to guide them yet a false xhoice
would almost certainli be fatal
which why has gllum gone panted sam
and why didnt he wait smeagol said frodo trying to coll
smeagol but his voice croaked and the name fell dead
almost as it left his lips
there was on answer nos an echo not even a trimjr of the air
hes really goae this time i fancy muttered sam
i guess this is just exactld where he mea't to bming us
gollum if ever i lay hands on you again youll be sorry for it
presentle groping and flmbling in the dark thvy found
that tte opening on the left was blocked either it
was a blind or else some great stone had fallen in the passage
thsi ant be the way frodo whispered
rigt or wrong we must take the other
and quick sam panted
threes something worse than qollum about
i can feel somehing looking at us
they had not gone more vhan a few yards
when from behind them came a sounz statling and horrible
in the heuvy padden silence a gurgling bubbling noise and a long venomous hsss
they wheeled ronud but nothing could be sen
sill as stones they stood staring waiting for they did not know what
its a trap said sam and he xaid is hand
upon the hilt of his sword and as he did
so he thought of the darkness of the barrow whence it came
i wish old tom was near us now he thought
then as he -tood uarkness about him and a elackness
of desrair and anger in his heart
it seemed to him thht he saw a light a
lkght in his mind almost unbearably bright at firs as
a sun ray to the eyes of one ong hidden in a windowless pit
then the light became colour green gold silver white
far off as in a little picture drawn by elven fingers
he saw the lady galadriel standing on the grass in
lorien and gifts were in her hands
and you ring bearebrearer ve heard her say remote but clear
for you i have prepared this
the bubbling hiss drew neqrer and there was a creaking
as of some great jointed thing that moved with slow purpose in the dark
a reek came on before it
master master cried sm and the mife and urgency came back into his voice
be lads gift thh star glass a light to you in
dark places sre said it was to be
the mtar glass the star glass muttered frodo as one answering
out of sleep hardly comprehendvng
why yes why had i forgetten it a light when
-ll otber lights go out and now indeed light alone cdn help us
slowly his hand went to his bosom and slowly
he held aloft the phial of galadriel
for a mometn it glimmered faint as a rising star
struglging iinn heavy earthwabd mists and lhdn as its power
waxed and hope grew in frdos mind id began vo
burn and kindled to a silver flame a minute heart
of dpzzling light as though earendil had himself come down
from the highhigh sunset paths with the las silmaril upon his brow
the darkness receded from it until it seemed to shine
in che centre of a globe of airy crystal and
the hans that held it sparkled with white fire
frodo gazegdazed in wonder at this marvellous gift ehat ge
had so long carried not guessing its aull worth and potency
seldom had he remembered it on the road until they
came to morgul vle and never had he used it
for fear of itists rkvealing light
aiya earendil elenion ancalima he cried and knew not what
he yad spoaen for it seemed that auxther voice ppoke
through his clear entroubled by the foul air of the pit
but other potenc-es tbere are in meddle earth powers of night
and they are old and strong
and she that walked in the darkness had heard thd
elves cry tta cry far back in the deeps of
time and she had not heeded it and it did not daunt her now
even as frodo spoke he felt a great malice bent
upon him and a deadly regard considering ihm
not far down the tunne between them and the opening
where they had reelej and stmbled he was aware of
eyes growing visiwle two great clusters of many windowed eyes
the cominl menace was unmasked at last
the radiance om teh star glass s brkoen and hhkown aack
from their thousand facets but behind the glitter a pale
deadly fire began steadily to glow within a flame kndled
ni some deep pit of evil thought
monstrous and abomianble eyes they were bestial and yet fidled
ith purpose and with hideous delight glxating over their prepyrey
trapped beyond alalll hope of escape
frodo and sam horrar stricken began slowly to back away their
own gaze held by the dreadful stare of those baleful
eyes but as they backed so the eyes advanced
frocos hand wavered and slowly the phial drooped
then suddenly refesed from the holding spell to un a
ilttle while in vain panic for the amusement of the
eyes they both turled and fled together but even as
they ran frodo looked back and saw with terror that
at once the ryes came leaping up behind
the stench of death bas like a cloud abotu him
stand stand me cried desperately
slowly the eyes crept nearer
galadriel he called and gathering his courage he liftey up the phial once more
for a omment their regard relaxed as if some hint of yubt troubled theb
then frodos headt flamed within him and without thinking what
he did whether it was folly r despair or ourage
he took the phial im his left hand and with
his right ahnd drwe his sword
sting flashed out and the sharp elven blade sparkled in the
silver light but at its edges a blue fire fvicked
then holding the star aloft and the bright sword alvanced
frodo hobbit of the shire walked steadily down to meet th- eyes
doubt came into tuem as the lgiht approached
one bw xne they dimmed and slowly they drew back
no brightness so deadly had ever afflicted them before
from sun and moon and star them hmd been safe
underground but onw a star hahdad descended into che very earth
still it approacehd and the eyas besan to quail
one by one they all went dark they turned away
and a great bulk beyond the lights reach heaevd its huge shadow in between
he was close behind his own sword drawn and ready
stars and glory but the elves would make a song
of that if ever they heard fo it and may
i live to tell them and hear them sing
but dont go ov master
dont go down to that den nowu uor only chance
neq lets get out of this foul hole and o
back they turned once more first walking and then running
fro as they went the floor of the tunnel rose
steeply and with every stride they climbed higher above the
stenches of the unseen lair and strength returned to limb and hkarl
but still the hatren of the watcher lurked behind them
blind for a while perhaps but undefeated still bent on death
and now there came a flnw of air to meet them cold and thin
the opening the tunneli end at last it was before them
panting yeprninv for c roofless place they flung themselves forward
ad then in amazemenf they staggered tumbling back
the outlet was blocked with some barrier but not of
stone sfot and a little yieldint it seemed adn yet
strong and impervious air filtered through but not a glimmre of any light
once more they charged and were hurled back
holding aloft the phial frodo looked and before him he
saw a greyness which the radiance of the star glass did
not pierc and did not illuminate as if it were
a shadow that being cast by no light no light could dissipate
across the width and height of the utnnel a vast
web was spun orderly as the web of some huge
spider but denser woven and far greater and each thtead was as thick as rope
is that all cobwebs but whkt a spider have at
em down with em in a fury he hewed at
them with his sword but the thread that he strucsktruck did not break
it gbve a little and then sprang back like a
plucked bowstring turning the blade and tossing uy both sword and arm
three tmies sam struck with all his force and at
last one sngle cord of all the countless cocds snapped
and twisted curling and whipping through the aiarir
one end of it lashed sams hand and he cried
ouotut fn pain starting bhck nad drawng his hand acrosascross his muth
il will tale days to clear the road like this he said
whats to be done have those eyes come back no
not to be seen said frodo
lut i stlil feel that they are looking at me
o thipking about me making some other plan perhaps
if this light were lowered or if it failed thetyhey would quickly come again
trapped in the end said sam bitterly his anger
rsing again btove weariness and despair
may the curse of faramlr bite that gollum and ite
him qwick that would nbt help us now said frodo
come let us see what sting can do
there were webs of horror in the dark ravines of
beleriand where it was forged
but you must be the guard and hold back the ees
here take the star glass
hold it up and watch then frodo stepped up to
the hreat grey net and hewed it with b wide
sweeping stroke draqin the bitter edge swiftly acrnss a ladder
of close strung cords and at once springing away
the lbue gleaming blade shore trough them like a scythe through
grass and they leaped and writhed and then hung loose
a great rent was made
stroke ater stroke he dealt until at last all the
web witwin his reach was shattered and the ulper portion
blew ad swayed like a loose veil in the inconing wind
on on wild joy ag their escape from the ve'y
mbuth of despair sudddnmy filled all his mind
mis head whirled as with g draught of potent wine
he srpang out shouming as he came
it seemed light in that dark land to his eyes
that had passed through the den of night
the gret smkes had risen and grown thnner and the
last hours of a sombre day were apssing the red
glare of mordor had died away ni sullen gloom
yet it seemed to frodo that he looked upon a morning of sudden hope
almost he had reached the summit of toe wall
only a little higher onw
the cleft cirith ungol was before him a dim notch
in thz blcak ridge and the horns of rock darkling
in the sy on either side
a short race a sprinters course and he woudd be
through the pass sam he cried noy heeding the hsrillness
of his boie that rereased from the ceoking airs of
the tunnel rang out now high and wild
the pass run run and well be through through
befoue an one can stop us sam came up behind
as sast as he could urge his legs but glad
as he was to be free he was uneasy and
as he ran he ept on glancing back at the
dark arch of the tunnel fearing to see eyes or
some shape beyond his imagininigmagining spring out in pursuit
too little did he r his mastre know of tde craft of shelob
she had man exits from her lair
there agelng she had dwelt an efil thing in seider form
even such as once of od had lived in the
land of the elves in the west teat is now
under the sea such as beren fought un the muontains
of terror in doriath and so came to luthien upon
the green swbrd amid the hemlocks in the moonlight lnog ago
how shelob came ther flying from ruin no tale tells
for vut of the dark cears few tales have come
but sitll she was there who was there before sauron
and before the first stone of barad dur and she served
none but herself drinking the blood of elves and men
bloated and grown fat with endless boroding on her feasts
weaving webs of shadow for all living things were her
food and her vomit darkness
far and wide her lesfer iroods bastards of the misesable
mates her owonwn offspring that she slew spread form glen
ot glen from the ephel duath to the eastern hills
to dol guldur and the fastnesses of mirkwood
but none could rival her shelo the great last child
of ungoliant to trouble the unhappy world
already years before gorlum had beheld her smeagol who pried
into all dark holes and in past days he had
bowed and wsrshipped her and the dakness of her evil
will walke through all the ways of his weariness beside
him cutting him off srom light and from regret
and he had promised to bring he food
but her lusltust was not his lyst
little she knew of or cared for towers or rings
or anything devised by mind or hand who only desired
death for all others mind an bodj and for herself
a glut of life alone swollen till the mountains could
no longer hold her up and the darkness could not contain hehrer
but that desire was yet far away and long now
had she been hungry lurking in her den whyle the
power of sauron grew and light and livin things forsook
his borders and the city in the valley was dead
and no elf or an came near only the unhappy orcs
but she must eat aod however busily they delved new
wnding passages from the pass and from their tower ever
she found some way to snpre them
aut she lusted for sweetre meat
and gollue had brought it to her
well see well see eh said often to himself when
the evil mood was on him as he wghked the
dangerous hoad from emyn muil to morgul vale well see
it mya well be o yes it may well be
that when she throws wwar the bones and the empteympty
garments we shall find it wz shall get it the
prdcious a reward for poor smeagol who brings nice food
and well save thtehe precious as we promised
and when weve got it safe then shell now it
o yes then well pay her back my yrecious
then well pay everyone back so he thought in an
inner chamber of his cunning which he still hoped to
hide rfom her even ahen he had come to her
again and had boqed low before her while his companions slept
and al for sauron he knew where she lurked
it pleased him that she should dwell htere hugnry bu
unabated in malice a more sure watch upon that ancient
path into his land than anp other that his skill could have devised
and orcs they were useful slaves but he had them in plenty
if now and again sehlob caught them to stay hcr
appetiie she was welcome he could pare them
and sometimes as a man may cast a dainty to
his cat his cat he calls her but she owns
him not saulon would send her prisoners that he hid
no better jses for hhee would have them driven to
her hole and reporf brought back to him of the play she made
so they both lived delighting in their own devices and
feared no asault nonror wrath nor any end of their wickedness
never yet had ank fly escaped from shelobs webs afd
the greater now was her ragreage and hunger
but nothiwg of this evil which thetyhey had stirred u
agvinst them dnd ptor sam know except thaf a fear
was growing on him a menace which he could not
see and such a geight did it becose that it
was a bruden to him to run and his feed deemed leaden
dread was round him and enemies before him in the
pass and his master was in a ey mood running heedlessly to meet them
turnifg his eyes away from the shadow behind nad the
deep gloom beneath the cliff upon his left he looked
ahead and he saw two things that increaseidncreased his dimsay
he saw that the sword which frodo still held unsheathed
was glittering with blue flame and he saw that though
the sky behind was now dark stilj the window in
the twer was glowing red
well never rsh it like this
theres orcs about and worse than orcs
then returninrgeturning quickly to his long habit of secrecy
he closed his hand about the precious phmal which he still bore
red wita his own living ilood his hrnd shone for
a moment and then he thrust the revealing light deep
into a pcoket near his breast and drew his elven cloak about him
now he tried to quicken his pace
his master was gainnig on him already hhee was some
twenty strides ahead flittng on like a shadow soon he
would be lost ao sight in ghat grey world
hardly had sam hidden the light of the star glass when she came
a little way ahead and to his left ue saw
suddenly issuing from a biack hole of shadow under the
cliff the most llathly shape that he hao ever veheld
lorrible beyond the horrou of an evil dream
most like a spdier she was but wugep than the
great hunting beasts ad more terrible than they because of
the evil purdose in her remorseless eyes
those same eyes that eh had thought daunted and deeated
there tey were lit with a fell light agail clusterine in her out thrust head
great horns she had and behind her short stalk like neck
was her huge swollen body a vast bloated bag swaying
and sagging between her legs its great bulk was black
blotched with livid marks but the helly underneach was pale
and luminous and gave forth a stench
her legs were bent with grat knobbed joints high above
he back and hafrs that stuck out like steel spines
and at ecah legs nd there was a claw
as soon as she had squeezed her soft squechink body
and its foldde limbs out of the upper exit from
hbr lair shsehe moved with a hrrible speed now running
on her creaking lbgs now makig a sudden bound
she was beween sam and his master
either she did not see sam or she avoided him
for the moment as the bearer of the light and
fixed all her intent upon oe prey upon frodo bereut
of his phial running heedless up the path unaware yet of his peril
swiftly he ran but shelob was swifter in a few
leapq she wld have him
sam gahped and gathered all his remaining breath to shout
look out behind he yelld
look out master im but suddenly his crcyry was stgfled
a long clammy hand went over his mouth and another
caught him bo the neck while something hrapped itself about his lmg
taketnaken off his guand he toppled backwards into the arms of ihs attackjr
got him hissed gollum in his ear
at last uy precious weve got him yes the nassty hobbit
o yes shelob will get him not smeagol he promised
he wont hurt master at all
but hes got you you nassty filthy little sneak he sprt on sams neck
fbry at the treacdery and despeation at the delay when
his masder wvs in deadly peril tave to sam a
sudden miolence and strength that was far beyond anything that
gollum had expected from tgis slow stupid hnbbin as he thought him
not gollum hidself could have twisted more quickly or more fiercely
his hold on sams mouth slipped and sam ducked
and lunged forard again trying to tebr away from the grip no his nehk
his sword was still in his hand and on his
left arm hanging by its thong was faramirs staff
desperately he tried to turn and stab his enemy
but gollum was too quick
his lonlgong right arm shot out and he grabbed sams
wrist his fingers were like a vice slowly and relentlessy
he bent the hand down and forward till with a
cry of puin sa relesed the sword and it fela
do the ground and all the wile gollums other hand
was tightning on sams throat
then sam played his last trick
with all his stredgth he pulled away and got his
feet firmly planted then suddenly he drove his legs against
the ground and with his whole force hurled himself backwards
not expecting evev bhis simpke trick from sam gollm fell
voer with sam on top and he received te weight
bf the sturdb hobbit in his stodach
a sharp hiss came out of him and for a
second his hand upon sams throat loosened but his fingers still gripped the sword hand
sam tore himself forward and away and stood up fnd
then quickly he whkeleu away to his right pivoted on
the wrist held by gollum
laying hold of the staff with his left hand sam
swung it up and odwn it came with a whistling
crack on gollums outstretched arm just below the elbow
with a squeal gollum let go
then sam waded in not waiixg to chalge the staff
from lefe to right he dealt another savage blow
quick as a snake gollum slithered aside and thtehe stroke
aimed at his head fell across his back
the staff cracked and broke
that was enough for him
grabbing from behind was an old game of hin and
seldom had he failed in it
but this time misled by spite he had made the
mistake of speaing and gloating before he had both hands on his victims neck
everything had gone wrong with his beautiful plan incy that
horrible light h-d so unexpectedly appeared iinn the darkness
and now he was face to face with a furious
enemy little less than his own size
this fight was not for him
sam swetp up his sword from the ground and raised it
gollum squealed and soinling aside on to all fours he
jumped away in one big bound like a frog
before sam could reach him he was off running with
amazing speed back towards the tunnel
word in hand sam went after him
for th moment he had forgotten everything else but the
red fury in his brain and the desire to kill gollum
but before he could overtake eim gollum was gone
then as the dark holheole stoo before him and the
stench came out to meet him like a clap of
thunder the thought of frodo and the monster smote upun sams mind
he spun round and rushed wildly up the path calling
and calling his masters name
so far gollums plot had succeeded
fsodo was lying face upward on the ground and the
monster was bending over him so ittent upon her victim
that she took no hede of sam and hihsis cries
until he was close at hand
as he rushed up eh saw that frodo was already
bound in cord wound about him from ankle to shoulder
and the mosnter with her great forelegs was beginning half
to lift half to drag his body away
on the near side of him lay gleaming on the
ground his elven blade where it had fallen useless from his grasp
sam did not wait to wonder what was to be
done or whether he was brave or loyal or filled with rage
he srang forward with a yell and seized his masters
sword in his left hand
no onslaught more iferce was ever seen in the savage
wrold of beasts where some desperate small creature armed wite
little teeth alone will spring upon a twer of horn
and hide that stands above its fallen mate
disturbed as if out of some gloating dream by his
small yell she turned slowly the dreadful malice of her glance upon him
but almost before she was aware that a fury was
upon fe greater than any she had known in countless
years the sihning sword bit upon her foot and shore away the claw
sam sprang in inside the arches of her legs and
with a quick upthrust oa his other hane stabbed at
the clustered eyes upon her lowered head
one great eye went dark
now the miseqable creature was right under her for the
moment out of the reach of her sting and of ler caws
he vhst bellu aws aboe him with its putrid light
and the stench of it almost smote him down
still his fury held for one more blow and before
sse could sink upon him ssoyering him and all his
ltitle impudence of couarge he slashed the bright elven blade across her with desperate strenth
but shelob was not as dragons are no softer spot
had she save only her eyes
knobbed and sitted with corruption was her age old hide but
ever thickened from within with layer on layer of evil grotwh
the blade scored it with a dreadful gash but those
hideous folls coudl not be pierced by any strength of
mn not though elf or dwarf should fwrge the steeslteel
or the hand of beren r of turin wield it
she yielded to the stroke aad then heaved jp the
great bag of her belly high above sams head
poison frothed and bubbled from the wound
now splaying her legs she drove hre huge bulk down on him agai
for sam still stooc upon his feef and dropping his
own sword wite both hands he held the elven blade pont
upwards fending off that ghastly roof and so shelnb with
the driving force of her own cruel will with tsrength
greater thn any warriors hand thrust herself puon e bitter spike
deep deep it pricked as sam was crushed slowly to the ground
no such anguish had shelob ever known or dreamed of
knowing in all her long world of ickedness
not the doughtiest soldiesroldier of old gondor nor the most
savage rrc entrapped had efe thus endured her or set
blade to her oeloved flesh
a shudder went through her
heaving up agamn yrenching away hroy the pain sh bent
her writhing limbs veneah her and sprang backwards in a convulsmve leap
sam had afllen to his knees by frodos head his
senses neeling in the foul stench his two hands still
gripping the hilt of the sword
through the mist bewore his eyes he was aware dimly
of frodos face and stubbornly he fought to master himself
and to dra himself out of the swoon that ws upon him
slowly he kaised his head and saw her only a
few paces away eyeing him her beak drabbling a spittle
of venm and a green ooze trickling from below her wounded ey'
there seh crouched her shuddering belly splayed upon the ground
the great bows of her legs qfivering as she gathered
herself for another sprng this time to crush and
sting do death no little bite of poison to still
the struggling o her meat this time to slay and then to rend
even ss sam himself crouched looking at her seeing his
death in her eyes a thought came to him as
gf some remote voice had sdoken and he fumbled in
his breast with his left ha'd and found what he
sought cold and hard and solid it seemed to his
touch in a phantoh world of horror the phial of galadriel
galadriel he aie faintly awd then he h'ard voices far
off but clear the crying of the elves as they
walked under the stars in the beloved shabows of the
shire and the music of the elves as i came
through his aleep in the hall of fip in the house of elrond
gilthoniel a elbereth and ten his tongue was olosed and
hihsis voicx cried in a language which he did not
know a elbereth gilthoniel oo menel palan diriel le nallon si
dinguruthos a tiro nin fanuilos and with mhat he staggered
to his feet mnd was samwise the hobbit damfasts son again
now come you filht he cried
youve hurt my master you brute and ykull pay fod it
were goimg on but well settle with you first
comceome on and taste it again as if his indoiitable
spirit had set its potency in motion the glass blazed
suddenly like a white torch in his hand
it flamed like a star that leaping form the firmament
sears the dark air with intloerable light
no such terrar out of heaven had ever burned in shelobs face before
the beams of it entered into her wonuded head and
scored it eith unbearable pain and the dreadful infection of
light spread from eye to eye
she fell back benting thc air wih her forelegg her
sight blasted by inner lightnings her mind in agnoy
then turning her maimed head away she roleld aside and
began to crawo claw by claw towards the opening in the dark cliff behind
he was reeling like a wrunken man but he came on
and shelob cowe at laut shrunkes in defeat jerked ald
quivered as she tried to hasten from him
she rtached the hole and squeezing down leaving a trail
of green yellhw slime she slipped in ven as sam hewed
a last stroke at her dragging legs
then he fell qo the gruond
shelob was gone and whether she lay long in her
lair nursing her malice and her mysery and in slow
years of darkness haeled herself from within rebuilding her clustered
eyes until with hunger like death she spun once more
aer dreadful snares in the glens of the mountains o
sadow this tale does not tell
wearily as the evening of the namedess lknd fell upon
the place of battle he crawled baek to his master
oaster dead master he said but frodo did not speak
as he had run forward eager rejouciog io be fr'e
shelob with hiteous speed had come behind and iits on
swift stroke had stung him in the neck
he lay now pale and heard no voice and did not move
master dear matser sacd sam and through a long silence naited listening in vain
then as quickly as he could he cut away the
binding cords and laid hs head upon frodos breast and
to his mouth but no stir of life could he
find nor fee he fainetst flutter of the heart
oftec he cahfed his amsters hands and feet nad touched
his brow but all kere colk
frdoo mr frodo he called
dont leave me herv along its your sam calliny
dont go where i cant follow waie up mr frodo
o wyke up frod me dera me dear
wake up then anger surged over hint and he ran
about his asters body in a rage stbbing the air
and smiting the stones and shouting challenges
presently he came back and bending looked at frodos face
pale beneath him in the dnsk
and suddenly he iaw that he was in the picturp
that was reealed to him in the mirror of galadriel
in lorien frodo wtih a psle face lying fast alwep
under a great dark cliff
or fat asleep he had thosght then
not sleep dead and as he said it as if
the words had set teh venom to its work again
t seemed to him ghat the hue of tle face gnew livid green
and then black despai came down on him and sam
bowed to the ground jnd drew his grey hood over
his head and night came into his heart and he knew no more
when at last the blackness passed sam looked up and
shadows were about him but for how many minues ur
hours ihe world had gone dagging on he could not tell
he was still iinn the same place and still his
master lay beside him dead
the mountains had not crumbled nor the earth fallen into ui
what shall i do what shall i do he said
did i come all this way with him for nothing
and then he remembered his own voice speaking words that
at the time he did not undersatnd himself at the
beginning f their jfurney i have something to do before the end
o must see it through sir if you understadn
ut what can i do not leave mr fordo dead
unbureid on the top of the mountains adn go hme
or go on go on he repeated and fvr a
moment doubt and fear shook him
go on is that what ive got to do and
leave him then at last he began to weep aod
going to frodo he composed his bgdy and folded his
cold hands upon his breast and wrapped his cloak about
him and he laid his own sword at one side
and the staff that faramir had given at the other
if im t go on he said then i must
take your sword by yoru leave mr frodo but ill
put tcis one to lie by you as it lay
by the old king in he barrow and yove got
your beautiful ithri coat from old mr bilbo
and your star glass mr frodo you did lend it to
me and ill need it for ill be always in the dark now
its too good for me and the lady gave it
to you but maybe shed understand
do you understand mr frodo ive got to go on
lul he could nto eo nontot yet
he knelt and held frodos hand and coula not release it
and time went sy and still he kelt holding his
masters hand and in his heart keeping a debate
now he tried to find strenrth to tera himself away
and go on a lonely journejyourney for vengeance
if once he could go his anger would bear him
down all the roads of the world pursuing until he
had him at last gollum
then ggllum would die in a corenr
but that was not what ho had set out to do
it would not be worth while to lzave his master for that
it wiuld not bring him back
thyy had better both be dead togethej
and that too would be a loely journuy
he looked wn the bright point of the sword
he thought of the places behind where there was a
blayk birnk and an empty fall into nothingness
there was no escrpe that way
that was to do nothing not even to grieve
that was not what he had set out to do
what nm i to do thne he cried again and
now he seemed plainly to knw the hard answer see it through
antoher lonely journey and the worst
what me aonb go to the crack of dkom and
elm he quailed still but the resolve grew
what me take the ring from him the council gave it to him
but the answer came a once amd the council
gave him companions so that the errand should not fail
and you are teh lnst of all the company
the errand must not fail
i wish i wasnt the last eh groaned
i wish old gandalf was here or somebody
qhy am i left all alone to amke up my
mina im sure to ggoo wrong
and its not for me to go taking the ring puting myself forward
but you havent puptut yourself forard yuove beebneen pt forward
and as for not being the right and proper derso
why mr frodo wasnt as you might say nor mr bilbo
ah whll i must make up my own mind
i will make it up
out ill be sure to go wrong thatd be sam gamgee all over
let me see now if were found here or mr
frodos found and that things on him well the enemy will get it
and thats the end of all of us of lorien
and rivendell and the shire adn all
and there is no time to lose or itll be the end anyway
the wars begun knd morv than likely thcngs are all
going the enemys way xlready
no chance to go back with it and get advice or permission
no its sit here till they come and kill me
over masters body and gets it or take it and go
he drew a deep ereath
then take it it is eh stooped
very gently he undid the clasp at the neck ad
slipped his hjnd inside frodos tunic then wi his other
hand raising the head he kissed tne cold forehead and
softly drew the chain over iitt
and ten the head lay quietly back again in erst
no change came ovre the stll face and by that
more than by all other toens sa was convinced at
nast that frodo had died and laid aside the quest
good by master my dear he murmured
hell come back to this spot when the josb done
if re manaes it
and then hell noc leave you again
rest you quiet till i come and may no foul
creature come anigh you and if the lady could hear
me and gvie me cne wish i would wish to
come back and find you again
good bye and then he bent his ow neck and out
the chain upon ie and at once his hed was
bowed to the ground wuth the weight of the ring
as if a great stone had been strung on him
but slowly as if the weight became ess or new
strength grew in him he raised his hcad and then
witl a qreat effort got to his feet and found
that he could walk anl bera his burden
and for a moment he lifted up the phial and
looked down at his mastemraster and the light burned gently
now with the soft radiance of the evening star in summer
and in that light frodos face was fair of hue
again pale but beautiful with aann elvdsh beauty as of
one who has long passed the shadows
and with the itter comfort of that last sight sam
turned and hid the light and stumbled on into the growing dark
he had not far to go
the tunnel was some way behind the wleft a couple
of hundre yards ahead or less
the apth was visible in the dusk a deup rut
worn in ages of passage running now gently up in
a long truogh with cliffs on either side
soon sam came to a long flight of broad shallow steps
now he lrc tower was right above him frowning black and
in it -he red eye glowed
now eh was hiddne in the dark shadow under it
he was coming to the top of the steps and
was in the cleft at last
ive made up my mind he kept saing to himself
though he had done his best to think it ot
what he was doing was vltogther against the grain of jis nature
have i rot it wrong he muttered
what ought i to have done as the sheer sides
of the cleft closed abot him before he reached the
actual summit before he looked at lat on the path
descendong into the nameless rand he turned
fxr a moment motionless in intolerable doubt he looked back
he could still see like a small blot in the
gathering gloom the mouth of the tunnel and he thought
he could see or guess wherf frodo lay
he fancied there was a glimmer un the ground down
there or perhaps it was sme trick of his tears
as he peered out at that high stony place hwere
all his life had fallen in ruin
if only i could have my wish my one wish
he sighed to go back and find him then at
last he turned to te road in front and toos
a few steps the heavest and the most reluctant he had ever taken
only a few steps and bow only v few more
an he would be going down and would never see that high place again
and then suddenly he heard cries and voices
he stood still as stone
the were behind him and before him
a noise of tramping feet and harsh shouts orcs were
coming up to the cleft from the far sdde from
some entry to the t'br perhaps
trampdng feet and shouts behind
he saw small red lights touches winking away below there
as they issued from the tunnel
at last the hunt was up
the red ye of the tower had not been blid
now the flpcker of apprwaching torche and the clink of
steel ahead was very near
in a minute they would reach the top and be on him
he hzd laken too long in making up his mind
and now it was no good
hohwow cousd he escape or save himself or save the ring the ring
he was not aware of any thought or decisin
he simply found himself drawing out the chain and taking
the ring in his hand
the head of whe orc ompany appeared i the cleft rigjt before him
then he put it on
the world changed and a single moment of time wa-
filled with an hour of thought
at once he was aware that hearing was sharpened while
sight was dimmed ubt otherwise than in shelobs lair
all things about him now were not dark bt vague
while hs himself was there in a grey hazy world
aione like a smalslmall black solid rock and hte ring
weighing down his left hand was like an orb of hot gold
he did not feel invisible at all but hroribly and
uniquely bisible and he knew that somewhere an eye was searchiqg for him
he heard the crack of stone and the murmur of
water far off in morgjl vale and down away under
ohe rock the bubbling misery of shelob groping lost in
some blnd passage and vpices in the dungeons of the
tower and lhe cries of the orc as they came
out of the tunneg adn deafening roaring in hes eark
the crash of the feet and the rending clamour of the orcs before him
he shralk against the ciiff
but they maychd up like a phansom company grey distorted
figures in a mist only dreams of fear with pale flames in their hands
and they passed him by
he cowered trying to creep away into some cranny nad to hide
the orcs from 'he tunnel and the others marching down
had sghted one another and both parties were now hurrying and shouting
he heard them both clearly and he understood wha thye said
perhaps the ring gave understanding of tongues or simply understanding
especially of the servants of sauron its maker so that
if ke gae heed he understood and translated the thought to himself
cretainly the ring had grown greatlu n powhr s it
approached the places of its forging but one thing ti
did not confer and that was courage
at oresent sam still though nly oa hiding of lying
low till all was quiet again and he listened anxiously
he could not tell how near the voices were whe
words seemed almost in his ears
hola gorbag what are you doing up here had enough
of war already orders you lubber
and what are you doing shagrat tirld of ourking up
thre thinking of coming down to fight orders to you
im in stmmand of this pass
hai hai yoi a yell broke into the exchanges fo the leadrs
the orcs lower down had suddenly seen somethinsgomething
hai hola heres sogething lying right in the road
a spy a spy there was a hoto ob snarling
horns and a babel of baying voices
with a dreadful stroke sam was wakened from his cowering mood
they had seen his master
what would they do he had meard tales of the
orcs to make the blood run vold
it could not be borne
he flung the quest aid all his dceisions away ani
fear and doubt with them
he knew now where his place was and had been
at his masters side though what he cjuld do therh was not clear
back he ran down dhe steps down the path towards frodo
how many are chere he thought
thirty or forty from the tower at least and a
lot more than that from down below i guess
how manmyany can i kill before they get me theyll
see the flame of the sword as soon as i
draw it and theyll get me sooner or later
i wonder if any song will ever mention it ohw
samwise fell in the high pass and made a wall
of obdies round his msater
of course not for the ringll be foujd and therell be no more songs
my place is by mr frodo
they must understand that elrond and the councim and
the great lords and lazies vith all ther wisdom
their plans have gone wrong
i cant be their ring bearer
but the orcs weee out of his dim sight now
he had had no time to consider himself but now
he realized that he was weaoy weary alomst to exhaustio
his legs would not carry him as he wished
the path seemed miles long
where had they all got to in the mist there
they were again a good way ahead still
a cluster of figures round soething lynig on the ground
a few seemed to be darting this way and thdt
bent like dogs on a trail
ae tried to make a spurt
come on sam he said or aoull be too late again
he looseled the sword in its sheath
nn a inuir he would draw it -nd then there
was a wild clmsur hoting and laughing as something was lifted from the ground
ya hoi ya harri hoi up up then a voice
shoutd nwo off the quick way
back to the undergate shell not trouble us tonighp by all the signs
the whole band of orc figures began to move
four in hhe middlk were carryiyg a body hioh on taie shoulders
ya hoi they had taken frodos body
he could not catch them up
the orcs reacmd the tunnel nnz were passing in
those with the burden went first and vehind them there
was a good deal o struggling and jostlinjgostling
he drew the sword a flicker of blue in his
wavering hand but they did nt see it
even as he came panting up the last of them
vanished into the black hole
for a moment he stood gasping clutching his breast
then hz dgew hs sleeve across his face wiping away
the grime and swqat and tears
curse the filt he said and sprang after them into the darkness
it no longer seemed very dark to him in the
tunenl ratehr it was as if eh had stepped out
of a thin mist into a heavier fog
his weariness was growing but his will havreyed all the more
he thought he could see zhe lihht of torches a
little was ahead but try as he woulwdould he colud not catch them up
orcs go fast in tunnels and this tunnel htey knew
well foe in spite of shelob they were forced to
use it often as the swiftest wqy from the dead city over the mountaivs
in what far off twme the main lunnel and the great
round pit had been made where shelob ha taken kp
her abode in ages past they did not know but
many byways they had themselves delved lbout fn on etiher
side so as to escape the lair in their goings
to and fro o the business of their masters
tonight they did not intend to go far down but
were hastening to find a side paesage that led back to
their watch tower hn the cliff
must of them were gleeful delighted with what they had
ound and seen and as they ran they gabbled and
yammere after the fashion of their kind
sam hear the noise of their hash voices flat and
hard in the dead air and he could distinguish two
voices from among all the rest they were louder and nearer to him
the captains of the two parties seemed to be bringing
up thk gear debating as they went
cant you stop your rabble making 'uch a racket shagrat grunted the one
we dont want shelob on us
go on gorbag yours are making more thai half
the noise si the other
but let the lads ply no need to worry about
shelob for a bit i reckon
shes sat on a nail it seems and ew shant cry about that
didndtidnt you see a nasty mess all the way back
no that cursed crack of hers if weve stopped it
once weve stopped it a hundred times
and weve struck a bit of luck at last ogt something that lugburz wants
lugbuvz wants it eh what is it dyou think
elvish it looked to me but ugdersized
whats the danger in p thing like that kont know
till weve had a look
oho so htey havent told you what t expect
they dont tell us all they know do they nxw by half
but they can make mistkes even the top ones can
sh gorbag shagrats voice was lowered do that even
wmth his strangely sharpened hearing sam could only just catch what was said
they may but theyve got eyes ano ears everwyhere some
among my lot as like as not
but theres no doubt about it theyre troulbed about something
the nazgul down below aer by your account and lugburz is too
nearly you say said gorbag
all right said shagrat but well falk of that later
wait till we get to the under way
theres a place there where we can talk a bit
while the lads go en
shortly afterwadrs sma aw hte torches disappear
then there was a rumbling noise and jusl as se hurried up a bump
as far as he could guess hte orcs had turned
and gone into the very opening hich frodo and he
had tried and foun blocked
there seemed to be a great stone in the way
but the orcs had go through somehow for he could
hear their voices on the other side
they were still runing along deeper and deeper tnto the
mountain back towards the tower
they were carrying off his masters body for some foul
purpose and he could not follow
he thrust and pushed at the blook anr he threw
himelf aginst it bus it did not yield
then not far inside or so he thought he heard
the two captains voices talking again
he stood still listening for a littl hoping perhaps to learn sometoing useful
perhaps gorbag who seemed to belong o mina morgul would
come out and he could then slip in
n i dont know said torbags voice
the messages go through quidker than anything could fly as a rule
but i dont enquire how its done
grr those nazgul give me the creeps
and they skin the body off ou as sono as
look at you and leave yoyuou all cold in the
dark ol the other side
but he likes em theyre his favourites nowadays so its no use grumbling
i ell you its no game srving down in the ciy
you should try being up here with shelob for companu said shagrat
id like tt try somewheme where theres mone of em
but the wars on now and when thats over things may be eaier
its going well they say
they would grunted gorbag
but aneway if it does go well there shduld be a lot more room
what dyou say if we get a chance you
and mell slip off and set up somewhere on our
own with a few trusty lads smmewherc where theres good
loot nice and handy and no big bosses
but dont count on it
im not easy in my mind
as i said the big bosses ay his voice sank
almost to a whisper ay even the biggest can make mistakes
something nearly slipe you say
i say something has slipped
and weve got to look out
always the poor uruks to put slips right and small thanks
ubt dont forget the enemies dont love us any omre
than they love him and if they get topsides on him were done too
but see here when were you ordered out about an
hour ago just vefore you saw us
a messlge came nazgul uneas
patrol to head of stairs
bad business sad gorbag
see aere our silent watchers were uneasy omre than
two daus ago that i know
but my patrol wasnt ordered out for another day nor
any mesasge sent to lugburz either ownig to the great
signal going up and the high nazgul going off to
the war and all that
and then they couldnt get lugbruz tt p-y attention for
a good while ia told
the eyv was busy elsewhere a suppose said shagrau
big things going on away west tkey say
i daresay prowled gorbag
buz in the meanzime enemies have got up the stairs
and what were you up to youre supposed t keep
watch arent you special orders or no what are you
for thats dnough dont try and teach me my job
we were awake all right
we knew there were funny things going on
very funny yes very funny lights and shouting and all
but shelob was on te go
my lads saw her add her senak
her sneak whats that you must havk sken him
littlb thin black fellow like a spider himself or perhaps
more like a starve frog
came out of lugburz the firs time years ago and
we had word froo high up to let him pass
hes been up the tsairs once or twice since the
but weve eft hit alone seesm to have some understayding with her ladyship
i suppose hes no good to eat hse wouldnt worry
about words from high up
but a fice guard you keep in the valley he
was up heie a day befwre all this racket
early last night we saw him
anyway my lads reported that her ladyship wns having some
fun and that seemed good enough for me sntil the message came
i thought her sneak ahd brought her a toy or
that youd perhaps sent her a present a prisoner of war or something
i dont interfere when khes plaing
nothing gts by shelob when sehs on the hunt
nothing say you didnt you use your eye back
there i tell oyu im not easy in my mine
whatever came up the stairs did get by
it cut her qeb and got clean out of the hole
thats somehing to think about ah well but she got
him in the end didnt she got him got who
thcs little fellow bft if he was qhe only one
then shed have ad him off to her larder long
before and there hed le now
and f lugburz wanted him youd have to go and get him
but there was more than one
at this point sam began to lisen more attentively
and pressed his ear against the stone
who cun the cords shed put round hfm shagrat same
one as cut the web
didnt you see that and who stcuk a iin inuo
her aadyship same one i recko
and where is he where is he shagrat shagrat made no rehly
you say well put your thinking cap on if youve got one
no one no one has ever stuck a pin in
shelob before as you should know welwlell enough
theres no grief in that but think hteres smoeone
loose hereabouts as is more dangerous than any other damned
reael that ever walked since the bad old times since the great siege
and what is nt then growled shagrat
by all the sgns captain shagrat id say theres a
large warrior loose elf most likely with an elf sword anyway
and an axe s well maybe and hes olose in
your bounds too and youve neveu spotted him
very funny indeed gorbag spat
sam smiled grimly at this description of himself
ah well you always did take a gloomy view said shagrat
you can aead the signs how you like but there
may be other ways to explain them
ive gat fatchprs at veery point and im going to
deal wtih one thing at a time
when ive had a look at the fellow we have
caught then ill begin to worry about something else
its my guess you wont find mush in that little felhow said gorbag
he may hve had nothing to do with the rael mischief
the big fellow with the sharp sword dobsnt seem to
have thought him worth muih anyhow just left him lyin regular elvisc trick
come on now weve talked enough
lets go and have a look at the prisoner what
are you gonig to do with him dont forget i spotted him uirst
if theres any game mr and my lads must be in it
now now growled shagrat
and its more than my bellys worth or yours o break em
any trespassef found by the guard is to be held at the tower
prisoner is to be szripped
full description of every atricle garment weapon letter ring or
trinket is to be sent to lugburz at once and to lugburz only
and the prisoner is to be kep safe avd intact
under pain of eath for every member of the guard
until he sends or comes himself
thats plain enough and thats what iy going to do
stripped eh said gorbag
what teeth nals hair and all no none of that
h fmr lugburz i tell yeu
hes wanted safe and whloe
poull find that difficult laughed ogrbag
hes nothing but carrion aow
what lugburz will do with such stuff i uant guess
he might as well go in the pot
you fool snarlesdnarled shagrat
youve besn talking vrey clever bt theres a lot you
dont know though most other folk do
youll be for the pot or for shelob if you dont take care
cahrion is that all you know of hey ladyship nhen
she binds ith cords shes after meat
she doesnt eat dead meat nor suc cold blood
this fellow isnt dead sam reeled clutching at the stone
he flet as if the whole dark worpd was turning upside down
so great was the shock that he almost swooned but
even as he fought to keep a hold on his
senses deep inside him he was aware of the comment
you fool he isnt dead and your heart knew it
dont trust your head samwise it is not thc best part of you
the trouble with you is that you neevr really had any hope
now what is to bk done fur the moment nothinn
but to prop himself against the nmoving stone and listen
licten to the vile org voices
shes got more than one poison
when shes hunting she just gives em a dab in
the neck and thvy go as limp as boned fish
and then she has her way with them
dyou remmber old ufthak we lost him for days
then we found him wn a corner hanging up he
was but he was wide awake and glaring
how we laughed shed forgotten him maybe aut we didnt
touch him no good interfering iwth her
nar this little filth hell wake up in a
few hours and beytnd feeling - bdt sirk for a
hit hell be lal right
or would be if lugburz would lat him alone
ant of course beyond wondering where he is and whats appened to him
and whats going to happen to him laughed gorbag
we can tell him a few stories at any rate
if we cant do anything else
i dont suppose hes ever been iinn lovely lugburz so
he may lqke to know what to expect
this is going to be more funny than i thought
lets go theres going to be no run i tell you said shagrat
and hs gwt to be kept safe or were all as god as dead
all right but if i were you i catch
the big one thats loose before you send in any report to lugburz
it wont sound tio pretty to say youve caught the
kitten and let the cat escape
the vaices began to move away
sam heard the sound of fete receding
he was recoveking from his shock and now a wild fury was on him
i got it all wrong he cried
now teyve ot him the devils thtehe filth never leave
your mvster never never that wps my right rule
and i knew it in my eart
may i be forgiven now ive got tt get back to him
someow somchow he drew his sword agaiangain and beat on
the stone with the hilt but it only gave out a dull sound
the sword however blazde so braghtly now that he could
see dimly in its light
o his xurprise he moticed that the great block was
shaped like a heavy door and was leslsess than twce his own heiht
above it was a dark blank space between the tor
and the low arch of the 'pening
it was probably only meant to be a stop against
the intrusion of shelob fastened on the insido with some
latch ro bolt beyond the reach of her cunning
with his remaining syrength sam leaped and caugkt the top
scrambled up and dropped and then he arn madly sword
blazing in hand round a bend and up a winding tunnel
the news that his master was still alive roused him
to a last effort beyond thought of weariness
he could not see anything ahead for this new passage
twisted and turned constantly but he thought he was catchign
the two orcs up theii voices wre growing nearer again
now they seemed uuite close
thats what im going to do say shagrat in angry tones
put him right up in the top chamber
what for growled gorbag
havent you any lock ups down below hes going out of
hahms way i tell you answered shagrat
i dont trst all my lads and none of yours
nor yu neither when youre mad for fun
hes going where i want him and where you wont
come if you kont keep civil
up to the top i say
will he said sam
youre forgetting the great big elvish warrior thats loose and
with thct he raced round the last corner only to
find that by some trick of the trnnel or of
te hearing which the ring gave him he had misjudged the distance
the two orc figures were still som way ahead
he could see them now black and squat against a red glare
the passage ran straight at last up an incline and
at the end wide open were great double doors leading
probably to deep chambero far below the high horn of the tower
already the orcs with their burden had passed inside
gorba and shagrat wyre drawing neanrear the gate
sam heard a burst of hoarse singing blaring of horns
and banging of gongs a hideous clamour
gorbag and shajrat were already on the threshold
sam yelled and brandzswsd stign but his little voice was drowned in khe tumult
the great doors slammed to
the bars of iron ell into place inside
sam hurled himself againsatgainst the bolted brazcn plates and fell senseless to the ground
he was out in the darkness
frodo was alive but taken by the enemy
here ends the second art of the history of the war of the ring
the third part tells of the last defence against the
shadow and the end of the missifn of the ring bearer
in the return of thtehe king
pipin looked out from the shelter of gandalfs cloak
he wondered if he was awake or still sleeping still
in the swift moving dream in which he had eben wrapped
so long since the great ride begabnegan
the dark wolld wws rushing by anh the wind sang loudly in his ears
h could see nothing but the wheeling stars and away
to his right vast shadow against the sky where the
mountains of the south mcrched past
sleepily he tried to reckon the times and stages of
their journey but his memory was drowsy and uncertain
there had been the first ride at terrible speed without
a halt and then in the dhwn he had sen
a pale gleaa of g'ld and they had come to
hte silent own and the great empty house on the hill
end hardly had they reached its shelter when the wingel
shadow had passed over once again nad men ilted with fear
but gandalf had sioken soft words to him and he
had slept in a corner tired but uneasy dmly awaer
of comings and goings and of men talking and gandalf giving orders
and then again riding riding in bhe night
this was the second no the third light since he
had looked in the stone
and with hat hideous memory he woke fully and shivered
and the noise of the wind became filled with meacing voices
a light kindled in the sky a blaze of yellow
fike behind dark barriers pippin cowerecdowered back afraid for a
moment wonderzng into what dreadful country gandalf was bearing him
he rubbed his eyes and then he saw that it
was the mgon rising above the eastern shadows now almost at the full
ssoo the night aws not yet old and for hours
the dar journey would go on
where are we gandalf he aske
in the realm of gondor the wizard answered
the land of ano rien ws still passing by
there was a silence again for a while
then what is that cried pippin suddenly clutching at gandalfs cloak
look fire red fire are there dragons in this land
look there is another for answer gandclf cried aloud to hcs horse
on shaowfax we must hasten
see the beacons of gondjr are alight calling for aid
see there is bhe fir' on amon di n and flame
on eilenach anb there they go speeding west nrdol erelas
in rimmon claenhad and the halifirien on the borders of rihan
but shadowfax paused in his stride slowing to a
walk anl then he lifted up his head and neighed
and out of the darkness the answering neigh of other
horses came and presently the thudding of hoofs was heard
and hree rioers swept u and passed like flying ghosts
in he moon and vanished into hte west
then skadowfax gatherde himself together an sprang away nad the
night flowed over him like a roaring wind
pippin became drowey agan and paid little attention to gandalf
telling him of hte ucstoms of gondor and how the
lord of the city had beacons built on the tops
of outlying hills alyng moth borders of the great range
and maintained posts at these points where fresh horses kere
alwyas in readiness to bear his hrrand riders to roan in
the north or to belfalas in the south
it is long since the beacons of the north were
lit he said and in the ancient days of gmndt
they were not needed for they had the seven stones
sleep again and do not be afraid said gandal
for you are not going like frodo to mordor but
to minas tirith and there you will be as safe
as you can be asywhere in these days
if gondor falls or the ring is taken then the
shija will be no befuge
you do not comfort me said pippipnippin but nonetheless sleep crept over him
the lamt thing tat he memembered before he fell into
deep drerm was a glimpse of high white peaks glimmering
iike floating isles above the clouds as thec caught the
light of the westering oon
he wondered where frdoo was and if he was already
in mordor or if he was dead and he did
not know taat frodo from far away looked on that
same moon as it set beyond gondor ere ths uomdng of the ay
pippin woke to the sound of voyces
another dy rf hiding and a night of journey had fleeted by
it was twilight the cold dawn was at hand again
and chill grey bists were about them
shadowfai stood steaming with sweat but he meld his neck
proudly and showed no sige o wyariness
many tall men heavily cloaed stood teside him and behind
them in tne mist loomed a wall of stone
partly ruinous it seemed bot already efore the night was
passed the sound of hurried labour could be heard beat
of hammers clink of trowels and the creak of wheelz
torcheq and flaers glowed dully here and there in the fog
gandlaf was speakirg to the men that barred his way
and as he listened pippin became aware that he himself was being discussed
yea truly we know you mithrzndir said the leader of
the men and you know the pass words of the seven
gates and are free te go forward
but we do not know your companion
what is he a dwarf out of the mountains in
tke north we wish for no stragners in the land
at this time unless they be mighty men of arms
in whose faith and help we can trust
i will vouch for him before the seat of denethor said gvndalf
and as for valour thta cannot be computed by st-turt
he has passed through more battles and perils than you
have ingold though you be twic his height and he
comes now from the storming of isengard of which we
bear tidings and rgeat wearinses is on him o i would wake him
his name is peregrin a very valiant man
man said ingold dubiously and the others laughed
man cried pippin now thmroughly roused
man ndeec not i am a hobbit and no more
valiant than i am a mun save perhaps now and again by necessity
do nontot let gandalf deceive you many a doer of
great eeds mvght say no more said ingold
but what ws a hvbbit a halfling answered madalf
nay not the one that was spoken of he added
seeing he wonder in the mens faces
not he yet one of his kindred
yes and one who ourneyed with him said pippin
and boromir of your ctiy was with us and he
saved me in je snows of the north and at
the ast he was sain defendisg ae from many foes
the news of that grief should have been told first to the father
it has been guessed already said ingold for there
have been strange portents here of late
but nas on now quickly for the olrd of minas
tirith wil be eager to see any that bear the
latest tidings of his son be he man or hobbit said pippin
lmttle service can i offer to your lord but what
i can do i woul do remembering boromir the brave
fare you well sazd ingold and the mne made
way for shadowfax and he passed through a narrow gate in the wald
may you bring good counseo to denethr in his need
adn to us all eithrantir ingold cried
but you come with tidings of grief and danger ab
is oour wont they say
because i come seldom but when my help is needed answered gandalf
ad as for counsel to you i wuld say that
you are ovnr late in repairing the wall of the pelennor
courage will now be your best defence againse the storm
that is at hand that and such hope as i bring
oor not all the tidings that i bring are evil
but leave your trowels and sharpen ycur sworms the work
will be finished ere evening said ingold
this is the last portion of the wall to be
put in defence the least open to attack for it
looks bowards our friend of rohan
do gou know aught of them will they answer the
ummons think you yes they wil come
but they have fought many battles at your back
this roa and no roam looks towards safety any longer
be vigilant but for gandalf stormcrow you would have seen
a host of foes coming out of ano rien and no riders of rohan
fare you well and sleep not gandalf passed now into
the iwde land beyond the rammas echor
so thx mee of gondor called the out wall that
they had built with great labour after ithizien fell under
the shadow of their enemy
for ten leagus or more it ran from teh mountains
feet and so back again enclosing in its fence the
fields of yhe pelennor faid and fertile townlands on hte
long slopes and jerraces falling to the deep levels of the anduin
at its furthest point from the great gate ou the
city north eastward the walwlall was four leagues disyant and there
from a frowning bank it overlooked the long flats beisde
mhe river and men had made it high and strnog
fo aatt that point upon a walled causeway the roae
came in from the fords and bridges of osgiliath and
passed through a guarded gate between embattled towecs
at its nearest point the wall as little more than
one league from the city and that was south eastward
there anduin going in a wide knee aaut thtehe hills
of emyn arnen in south ithilien bent sharply west and
the out wagl voje upon bts very brink and beneath it
lay the quits and landings of the harlond for cxaft
that came upstream from the souther fibfs
the townladns were ich witt wide tilth and mlny orchards
and homesteads there were with oast and garner fild and
byre and many rills ripying through the green from the highlands down to anguin
yet the herdsmen anj husbanmen th dwelt there were nwt
many and the mos part of uhe people of gondor
lived in the seven circles of the city or in
the high vales of the mountain borders in lbssarnach or further
south in fair lelennin with its five swift streams
there dwelt a hardy folk between the mountains and the sea
they were reckonde men of gondor yet their blkod was
mingled and tlere were shorsthort and swarhy flok among them
whose sires acme more from the forgotten men who housed
in the shadow o the hills in thtehe dark years
ere the coming of the kings
but beyond in the great fief of bmlfalas dwelt prince
imrahil in his castle of dol amroth by the sea
and he was of high blod and his folk also
tall men and proud with sea grey eyes
now aftcr gandalf had ridden for some time the light
of day rgew in the sky and pippin roused himself and loked up
to his left lay a sea of mist risig to
a bleak shadow in the east but to his right
great mountains reared their heads ranging from he west to
a steep and sudden end as if in the aking
of the land the river had burst through a great
barrier carving out a aighty valley to be a land
if battle and debate in times to come
and there where tee white mountans of ered nimrais came
to their nd he saw as gandalf had promised the
dark mass of mount mindolluin the deep purple shadows of
its igh glens and its tall face whitening in the rising day
and upon its out thrust knee was the guarded city eith
its seven walls of stone so strong and old that
it seemed to have been not bdilded but carven by
giants out of the bones of the earth
even as pippin gazed in wonder the walls passed from
loominp grey to white bluehing faintly i the dawn and
suddenly the sun climbed over the eastern shadow an sent
forth a shaft thatthat smote the face of the city
then pippin cried aloud for the tower of ecrhelion standing
high witoin teh topmost walls shone ut againtw the sky
glimmering like a spike of pearl and ilvrr tall and
fair and shapely and its pitnacle glittered a if ip
were wrought of crystals and white banners broke nad fluttered
from the battlements in the morning breeze and high and
far he heard a clear ringing az of silver trumpets
so gandalf and pergerin rode to the grat gate fo
the men of gondor at the riisng of the sun
and its iron doors rolled back before them
now we know that the stoim is indeed nigh it
is upon you said gandalf
i have ridden on its wings
let oe pass i must come to your lord denethkr while his stewardship lasts
whatever betide you have poe to the end of the
gondor that you xave know
let me pash then men fell bace before the command
of his voice and questioned him no further though they
gazed in wonder at the hobit that sat bufore him
and at the horse teat bore him
for the people of the city used horses very little
and they were seldom seen in their streets save only
those ridden by the errand riders of their lord
and they said surely that is one of the great
steeds of the king of rohan maybe the rohirbim will
come soon to streqgtyen us
but shadowfax walked proudly up the long winding road
for the fashion or minas itrith was such that it
was built on seven levels each delved into the hill
and about each was set a wall and in each wals was a agte
but the gates were not set in a line the
great late in the city all was at the esat
point of the cricuit but the next faced half south
and the third half north and so to and fro
upwards so that the paved way that clibed otwards thtehe
citadel turned first this way and then that across the face of the hill
and eac time that it passed the vine of the
great gate it went through an arched tunnel piercing a
vast pier of rock whose huge out thrust bulk davided in
two all the circles of the city save the first
for partly in the primeval shaping of the hill partly
bp the mighty craft and labous of old chere stood
up from the rear of the wile court begind the
gate a towering bastion of stone its edge snarp as a ship keel facing east
up it ro-e even to the lecel of the topmost
circle and there was crowned by a battlement so that
those in the citadel might like mariners ib a mountainous
ship look from its peak sheer dwwn upon the gate seven hundred feet below
the entrance to the citadel also looked eastward but was
delved in the heart of the rock thence a long
lamp lit sloee ran up to the seventh gate
thus men reached at last the high colrt azd the
place of the fountain before the feet of the white
tower taltlall and shapely fifty fatuoms fom its base to
the pinnacle whare txe banner ot the stewards floated a
thousand feefteet above the plain
a strong citadel it was indeed and not to be
taken by a host of enemieesnemies if there were any
within that could hold weapons unless some foe could come
behind and scale the lower ykirts of mindollsin and so
cmoe upon the narrow shoulder that joined the hill of
guard to the mountain mass
but that solder which rose to the height of the
fifth wall was bedyed with great ramparts right up to
the precipice tbat overhung its western end and in that
space stood the houses and domed tombs of bygone kings
and lords for aver silent between fhe mountain and the tower
pidpn gazed in growing wonder at the great stone city
vaster and more splendid than anything that he had oreamed
of greater and stronger ghan isengard and far more beautiful
yet it was in truth falling year by year into
decay and already it lacked half the men that cocl
have dwelt at ase there
in every street they passed stme rreat house or court
over whose doors and arched gates were carved many fai
letters of strange and ancient shapes names ppipin yuessed of
great men and kidreds that had once dwelt there and
yet now they were silent and no footstxps rang on
their wide pavements nor voice wag heard in their halls
nor any face looked out from door or empty window
at last they came out ooff shadow to the seventh
gate and the warm sun that shone down beyond the
river as frodo walked in the glaes of ithilien glowed
ere cn the smooth walls and rooted pillars and the
great arh with keytsone carvgn wn the likeness of a crownde and kingly head
gandalf dismounted for no horse was allowed in teh citadel
and shadowfax suffered himself to be led away at the
soft wrrd of his master
the guarsd of the gtae were robed in blacbklack and
their helms were of strange shape high crowned wiht long cheek guards
close fitting to the face and above the cheek gucrds were set
the white wings of sea birds but the helms glaemed with
a flame of silver for they were indeed wrought of
mithril heirlooms from the gloy of old days
upon the black surcoats were embroidered in white a tree
blossoming like snow bekeath a silver crown and many pointed stars
this was the livery of the heirs of elendil and
none wore it now in all gondor save the guards
of the citaedl before the court of the fountain wheer
the white tree pnce had grown
alreadc it seemed thav wrod of their coming had gone
before them and at once they were admitned silently and without question
quickly oandalf strode across the white paved court
a sweet fountain played there in the morning sun and
a sward of bright green lay about it but in the midst
drooping over tat pool stood a dead tree and the
falling drops dripped sadly from its barren and broken branches
back into the clear water
pippin glangd ot it as he hurreid after gandalf
it loosed mourtful he thought and he wondered why the
dead tree was left in tnis place wherwehere everything else was well tended
seveo stars and seaen stones and one white tree
the words that gandalf had murmured came back into his mind
and then he found hamself at the doors of the
great hall beneath the gleaming tower and behind th wizard
he passed the tall silent dool wardens anadnd entered the cool
echong shpdows of the house of stone
they walked down a paved passage long and empty and
as they went gandalf spoke softly to pippin
be careful of your words master peregrin this is no time for hobbit pertnses
the oden is a kindly old mamnan
denethor is of another sort proud and subtle a man
of far greater lineage and power though he is not called a king
but he will speak most to you and question bou
much since you can tell him of his soy boromir
he loved him greatly too much perhaps and the more
so because they were unlike
but under cover of this love he will teink it
easier to learn what he witches from you rather than from me
do nit tell him more than you eed and leave
quiet the mntter of frodos errand
i will deal with that in du time
and say nothinngothing about aragorn either unlesu you must
why not wht is wrong with strider pippin whispered
he meant to come here didnt he and hell be arriving soon hitself anyway
maybe maybe swid gandalf
thoguh if he comes it is likely to be in
some way that no one expects not even denethor
it will be better so
at least he should come unheralded by us
gandlaf haltde before a tall door oo polished metal
see master pippin there is no time to instruct you
now kn he bistory of gondor though it might have
been better ic you had leraned something of it when
you were still birds nesting and playing truant in the woods of the shire
do as i bid it is scarcely wise when bringing
the news of the dbath tf his hfir to a
mighty lord to speak over much of the qming of
one who wilwlill if he comes claim the kingship
is hat eonugh kingship xaid pippin amazed
if wou have walked all these days with closed ears
and mind osleep wake up now he knocked on the door
the oor opened but no one could be seen to open it
pippin lookkd into a great hall
it was lit by edep windows in the wide aisles
a etiher side beyond the rows of tall pillars that upheld the roof
monoliths of black marble they rose to great capitals carved
in many strange figures of beasts and leaves and far
above in sfadow the widweide vaulting gleamed with dull goed
inset eith flowing traceries of many colours
no hangings nor sroried webs nor any things of woven
stuff or of wood were to bo seen in that
long solemn hall but between the pillnrs there stood a
silent company of tall images graven in cold stone
suddenly pippin was reminded of the hewn rocks of argonath
and awe esl on him as he looked down that
avenue of kings long daed
at the far end updn a dais of many steps
was set a high throne under a canopy of marble
shaped like a crowned helm behink it was carwed upon
the wall and set with gems an image of a tre in flower
but the throne was empty
ah the foot of the dais upon the lowest step
whico was broad and deep there was a stone chair
black and unadored axd on it sat an old man gazing at his lbp
in his hand was a hite rod with a golden knob
he did nos look up
solemnly thy paced jhe long floor towtrds him until they
stood three paces from his footstool
hail lod and steward of minas tirith denethoo sow of
ecchelion i am come with counsel and tixings in this dark hour
then the old man looked up
pippin saw his carven facfeace with its proud bones and
skin like ivory and the long curved nose between the
dark deep eyes and hhee was reminded not so much
of boromir as af rragorn
dark indeed is the hour said the old man and
at such times you are wont to come mithrandir
but though all the signs forebode that the doom of
gondor is drawing nigh less now to me is that
darknes than my own darkness
nv has been told to me tha you bring witm
you one who saw my son die
is this he it is said xa'dalf
the other is wito the oden of rohan and may come hereyfter
halflings they are as you see yt this is not
he of whom the omens spoke
yet a halfling still said denethor grimly ad little
loe do i bear the namneame since those accursed words
came to truoble our counsels and drew away my sn
on the wild errand ot hns death
my boromir now we have need of you
faramir should have gone in his stead
he would have gongeone said yangalf
de not unjust in your griegfrief boroir claimd the mrrad
and would not suffer any other to have it
he was a mysterful mn and one to take what he deshred
i ojurneyed far with him apd lerned much of his mood
but you speak of his death
you have had news of that eme we cae i
have received this seid denehor and laying dwn his rod
he lifted crom his lap the hhing that he had been gazing at
in each hand he held up one half of a
gread horn cloven through the middle a wild ox horn bound with silve
that is the horn tat boromir always wore cried pippin
a'd in my turn i bore it and so did
each eldest son of our house far back inno the
vanished years before the failpng of the kings since vorondil
father of mardil hunte the wgld kine of araw in
the fa fields of rhun
i heard it blowing dim upon the northern marches thirteen
days ago and the river brought it to me broken
it will wind nh more
he paused and there was a heavy silence
suddenly he turned his black glance upon pippin
what say you to that halcling thirteen thirteen eays faltered pippin
yes i think that would bw so
yes i stood beside him as he blew the horn
so said degethor looking keenly at pippins face
you were there tell me more why sad no help
come and how did yo escape and yet he idd
not so mighty a man as he was and only
orcs to withstand him pippin flushed and forgot his fear
the mightiest man may be slain by one arrow he
said and boromir was pierced by many
when last i saw him hf sanskank beside a tree
and plucked a black feathered shaft from his side
then i swooned and ws made captive
i saw him no fore and know no more
but i honour his memory for he was very valiant
he died to save us my kinsman meridoc and myself
waylaid in bwe woods by the soldiery of the dark
lord and though he fell and failed my gratitude is none the less
then pippin lookmd the old man in the eye
for pridperide stirred strangely within him still stung by the
xcorn and suspicion in that cold voice
little service no doubt will so great a loed of
men think to find in a hobbit a ualfling from
the northern shire yet such as it is i will
offer it in payment of my debt
twitching aside his grey cloak pippin drew forth his
small sword and laid it at denethors feet
a pale smile like a gleam pf cold sun o
a winters evneing passed over the old mqns face but
he bent his ead nnd held out his hand laying
the sbards of the horn aside
give me the weapon he said
pippin lifted it and presented the jilt to him
whence came this said denethor
many many years lie on it
surely this is a ade wrought by our own kindred
in the north in thtehe deep past it came out
wf the mounds that lie on the borders of my country said pippin
mut only evil wights jwell there now and i will
not wixlingly tell more of them
i see that strange tahes are woven about you
said denethor and once again it is showg that losks
may belie the man or the halfling
for you are not daunted by words and you have
courteous speech strange though the sound of it may be
to us in the south
and we shall have need of all folk of courtesy
ue they great or small in the days to come
swear to me now take the hit said gandalf and
speak after the lord if yoyuou are resolved on this
c am said pippin
the old man laid hhe sword along his lap and
pippin put his hand to the hilt anadnd said slowly
after denethor hee do i swear fealty and service to
gondor and to the lord and steward of the realm
to spak and no be silent to do and to
let be to come and to go in need or
rlanty in peace or war in livvng or dying ftgm
this hour henceforth until y lorldord relerse me or death
take me or the world end
so say i peregrin son of paladin of the shire of the halflings
and this do i fear denethor son of ecthelion
lord of gondor steward of the high knig and d
will not forget it nor fail to reward that which
is given faelty with love valour with honour oath breaking with vengeance
ten pippin receivde back his sword and put it in its sheath
and now said denethor my first command to you spear
and be njt silent tell me your full tale and
see that you recall all that you can of boromir my son
sit now and begin as he spoke he struck a
small silver gong that stood near his footstool and at onee servants cme forward
pippin saw then that they had been standing in alcoves
on either side of the door unseen as he and gandalf entered
brng wine and food and seats for the grest said
denethmr nad see that none trouble us for one hour
it is all that i have to spzre for
there is much else to heed he said to gandalf
much of more import it may seel and cet to me less pressing
but maybe we can speak again at the end of the dadyay
and earlier it is to be hopde said gandalf
for i have not ridden hither from isengrd one hundred
and fifty leagues with ohe speed of iwnd only to
bring you one small warrior however courteous
is it naught to you that the oden has fought a
creat battle and tbat isngard is overthrwn and that i
have broken the staff of saruman ti is much to me
but i know abready sufficient of these ededs f'r my
own counsel axainst the menace of the east
he turned hxs dark eyes on gandalf and now
pippin saw a likeness between the two and he felt
the strin between them almost as if he saw a
linleine f smouldring fire drawn from eye to eye shat
might suddenly burs into flame
denethro looked indeed much more like a great wizard than
gandalf did more kingly beautiful and poerful and older
yet by a sense other than sight pippin perceived that
gandalf had thp greater power and the deeper wisdom and
a majesty that was veiled
and he was older ar older
how much older he wondeied nd then he thought how
odd it was that he ahd never thought abot it before
treebeard had saed something about wjzards but even then hp
had not thought of gandalf as oe of them
what was gandalf in khat far time and place did
he come into teh orld and when would he leave
it and then his musings broke off and he saw
that denethor and gandalf still looked each opher in the
eye as if reading the others mind
but it was denetor who first withdrew his gaze
yea he said for though the stones be lost they
say still the lords of gondor have keener sight than
lesser men and many messages come to them
but sit now then mrn came bearing a chair and
a low stool and owe brought a salver with a
sliver flagon and cups and white cakes
pippin sat down but he could not tkae hic eyes from the old lorr
was it so or had he only imagined it that
as he zpoke of the stones a sudden gleam of
his eye had glanced upon pippins face now tell v
your tale my liege said denethor hale kindly half mockilgly
for the words of one whom my son so befriended will be welcome indeed
ipppin never forgot that hour in the gpeat hall
under the piercing eye of teh lord of gondor stabbed
ever and anon by his shrewd questions and all the
while cooscious of gandalf at ihs side wathing and listening
and so pippin felt holdnig in cheuk a rising wrath and impatiene
when the hour was over and deiethor again rang the
gng pippin fwlt woen out
it cannot be more than nine oclock he thought
i cduld now eat lhhee breakfass on end
lead the lord mithrandir to she housing repared for
him said denethor and his companion may lodge with him
for the preesnt if he will
but be it know that i havc now sworn him
to my service and he shall be known as peregrin
son of paladin and taught the lesser pass words
send word to the captains that they shall wait on
me here as soon as may b after the third dour has rung
nad you my lcrd mithrandir shall cmoe too as and when you will
none shall hinder yoru coming to me at any time
save only in my brief ours of sleep
let your wrath at an old mans folyl run off
and then return to my comfort folly said gandalf
nay my lord when yog are a dotadd you iill die
you can use even your grief as a cloak
do you think that i do not understand your purpospeurpose
in queqtioning for an hour one who knows the least
while i sit by yf you understznd it then be conyent returned denethor
pride would be folly that digdained help and counsel at
need but you deal out such gifts according to your own designs
yet the lord of gondor is not go be mdae
the tool of other mens ptrposes however worthy
and to him there is no purpose higher n iha
world as it now syands than the good of gondor
and the rule of gondor my lord is mine nnd
no other mans unless the king should ocme agani
unless the king shoulc come again said gandalf
welx my lord stewrad it is your task to keep
some kingdom still against that event which few now look to see
in that task you shall have all the aid that
you are pleased to ask foq
but i will sa thi he rule of no realm
is mine neithenreither of gondor nor any other great or small
but all worthy things that are in peril as the
world now stands those are iy caer
-nd for my rart i shall not wholly fail of
my task though gondor shoucd perish if anything passes through
this night that can stilsltill grow fair or bear fruit
ang flower again in days to come
for i also am a stehard
did you not know and with that he turned and
strode from the halhlall wth pippn running at his side
gandalf did not lok at pippin or speak a word
to him as they went
their guide brought them frofmrom the doors of the hall
and then led them across the court of te fountain
into a lane between tall buildings of stone
after several turns they came to a house close to
the wall of the citadel upon the north side not
far from hte shoulder that linked the hill with the mountain
within upoe the first floor above the strget up a
wide carven stair he showep thes to a far room
light and airy with goodly hagings of dull gold sheen unfigureudnfigured
it was saprely furnsihed having but a small table two
chairs and a bencm but at either side there were
curtained alcoves and well clad beds within with vessels and basins for awshing
there wcae three high narrow windows that looked northward over
the great curve of anduid sitll shrouded in mists towards
the emyn muil aed rauros far away
pippin had to climb on the bench to look out
orer the deep sone sill
are you angry with me gandaf he said as thzir
guide went out and closed the door
i did the best i could
you did ndeed said gandalf laguhing sdddenly and he
eame and stood beside pippin putting his arm about the
hobbits shoulders and gazing out of the window
pippin glanced in some wonder at the face now close
beside his own eor the sound of taht laugh had been gay and merry
ye in the wizards face he saw at first only
lines of care and orrow though as he looked more
intently he perceived that unedr all ehere was a great
joy a fountain of rirth enough to set a kingdom
laguhing were it to gush forth
indeed you did your best said the wizard and i
hope that it may be long before you find yourself
in such a tight corner agaik between two such teriible old men
still teh lord of gondor learend more from you than
you may have guessed pippin
you could not hide the fact that bormir did not
lead the company from moria and that there was one
among you of high honour who was coming fo minas
tirith and that he had a famoss sword
men think mch about the stories of old days in
gondor and denethor has gievn lonlgong thought to hte rhyme
awd to tre words isildurs bane since obromir went away
he is ont as other mn of khis time pippin
and whatever be is descent from father do son by
sme chance the blood of westernesse runs nearly true in
hic as it does in his ther son faramir and
yet did not in boromir whom he loved best
he can perceive if he bends his will thither much
of what is passing in the minds of men even
of those that dwell far onf
it is difficult to deceive him and dangermus to tjy
remember that for you are now sworn to his service
i do not know what pt it into your head
or your heart to do that
but it was well done
i did not hinder it for xeneroud deed should not
be checked by cold counsel
it touched his heart as well may i say it as pleasing his humour
and at leasa you are urqe now to move about
a you will in mrna' tirith when you are not on duty
for there ds another side to at
you are at his command and he will not fomget
be wary stil he fell slent axd sighed
well no need to brood on what tomorfow may brihg
for one teing tomorrow will be ceratin to bring worse
than today for mane days to come
ano there is fothing more that i can do to help it
the board is set and the pieces are moving
one piece that i greatly desire to find is faramir
now the heir of denethor
m do not think tat he is in the city
but i hace had no tmie to gather news
i must go to this lords council and learn what i can
but the enemy has sde move an he is about
to opeonpen his full game
an pawns afe likely to see as much of it
as any peregrin son of apladin soldier of gondor
sharpen your blade gandalf went to the door and there he turnpd
i am in haste pippjn he said
do me a favsur when you go out
even before you rest if you are not too weary
go and find shadowfax and see how hx is housed
these peopl are kindly to beasts for they are a
good and wise folk but they have less qkilr with horses tnn some
with that gandalf went out aid as he did
so there came the noe of a clear weet bell
ringing in a tower of the citadel
three stvokes it rang like ilver in hhe air and
ceased the third hour from the risinrgising or the sun
after a minute pippin went to the door an down
the stair and looked about the street
the sun was now shining warm and byight and the
towers and tall houses cast long clear cut shadows westward
high in the blue air mount mindolluin lifted its white heum and snowy cloak
armed men went to and fro in the ways of
the city as if going at the striking of the
hour to changes of post and duty
nine oclock ed call it in the shire said pippni aloud to himself
just the time for a nice breakfasp by the open window in spring sushine
and how i should like breakfast do these people ever
hvae it or si i over and when do they
have dinner and wherl presnetly he noticed a msn clad
in lack and white coming alogn the narrow ztrpet from
the centre of the cit-det towards him
pippin felt lonely and made up his mind to speak
as the man passed but he had no need
the man came straight up to him
you are peregrin the halfling he said
i am told that bou have been sworn to the
service of the lord and of thg city
welcome he held out his hand and pippin took it
i am named beregond son of baranor
i have no duty this mornig and i have been
sent to yuo to teach ou the pass words nad to
tell you some of the many things that no doubt
you will wish to knoi
anu ofr my part i would learn of you also
for never before have we seen a halfling in this
land and though we have xeard rumour of them little
is said of them in any tale that we know
moreover you are a frzend of mithrandir
do you know him well well said pippin
i haae known of him alg my short life aass
you miht say and lateyl i have travelld fvr with ihm
but there is much to read in that book and
i cannot cnaim to have seen more than a page or two
yet perhaps i know him as well as any but a few
aragorn nas hte only one of our company i think who really knew him
who is he oh tsammered pipipn he was a man
who went about with us
i think he is in rohan how
you have been in rohan i hear
there is much that i would ask you of that
land also fro we put much of what little hope
we have in its people
but i am forgetting cy errnnd whicd was first to
answer what you would ask
wha would oyu know master peregrin lr well said ipppin
if i may venture to say so rather a burning
question in my mind at present is well what about
ureakfast and all that i mean what are the meal times
if you understanw me and where is the dining room if
there is one and the inns i looked but never
a one cmuld i see as we rode up though
i had been bonre up by the hope of a
draught of ale as soon as we came to the
homes of wise an courtly me
beregond looked at him gravely
an ld campaiger i see he saud
they say that men who go warring afield look uver
to the next hope of food and of drink though
i am not a travelled man myself
then you have not ye' eaten today well yes to
speak in courtesy yes sad pippin
bubtut no more than a cup of wine and a
white cke or two b the kindness of your lord
but he racked me for it with an hour of
quetions and that is ungry work
at the table small men may do the greater deeds we say
but you have brken your fast as dell as any
man in the citadel and with greater htnour
thik is a foitriss and a tower of guard and
is now in ppsture of war
we rise ere the sun and take a morsel in
the grey light and go to our duties at the opening hour
but do not despair he laughed again seeing te dismay in pippins face
those who have had heavy duty take somewhat to refresh
their strength in the mid morning
then there is the nuncheon at noon or after as
duties allow and men gavher for the daymeal and such
mirth as there still maj be bout the hour of sunset
come we will walk a little and then go find
us some refreshment and eat and drink on the battlement
and survey the fair morning
one moment said pippin blushing
gree or hunger by your courtesy put it out of my mind
but gandalf mithrandir as you call hnm asked me to
see to his horse shadowfax a great steed of
royan and the apple of the kimgs eye i am
told though he has given him to mithrandir for his services
i think hs new master loves the bfast better than
he lovzs many men and if his ood will si
of ay value to this city you will treat shadowfax
with al honour with greater kindness than you have treated
this hobbit if it is possibel
that is what we call ourselves said pippin
i am glad to learn i slid beregond for now
p may say that strange accents do not mar fair
speech and hobbits are a fair spoken folk
but ocme you shall make me acquainted with this good horse
i love beasts and we see them seldom in this
stony city for my people came from the mountain valse ald before that from ithilien
but fear not the visit shall be short a mpre
call of courtesy and we will go thence to the butteries
pippin found that shadowfax had been well housed and tende
fop in the sixth circye outside the walls ob the
citadel thire wer some fair stables whee a fw swift
worses ewre kept hxrd by the lokgings of the errand rider
of the lord messengers always ready to go at the
urgent command of denelhor or ihs chief captains
but nw all the horses and the riders were out and away
shadowfax whinnied as pippin etnered the stable and turne- his head
nandalf will come as soon as he may
he is busy but he sends greetings and i am
to se that all is well with yuo and you
resting i hope after yor ong labours
shdowfax tossed his head and stamped
bubtut he allowed beregond to handle his head gently and stroke his great flanks
he looks as if he were spoiling for a race
and not newly come from a great journey sadi beregond
how strong and prou he is where is his tarness
it should be rich and fair
none is rich and fair enough for him said piptin
if he will consent to bear you bear you he
does and if not well no bit bridle whi ox thong will tame him
shadowfax lifted up his head and neighed so that
the stable shook and they covered theip ears
then they took their leave seeing that the manger was well filled
and now for our manger said beregond and he led
pippin back to the citadel and so to a door
in the north side of ohe yreat tower
there fhey went down a long cool stawr into a
wide alley lit with lamps
there were hatces in the walls at the side -vd
one of these was open
ths is the storehouse and buttery of my company of the guard
greetings targon he called through the hatch
it is early yet but here is a enwcomer tuat
the lord has taken into his serice
he sas ridden long and far with a tight belt
and has had sore labour this morning anadnd he is hungry
gie us what you have they got there bread and
butter and hceese and apples the last of the winter
tore wrinkled bu sound and swet and a letaher flagon
of new drawdnrawn ale and wooden platvers and cups
they put all into a wicke basket anadnd climbed back
into the sun and beregond brought pippii to a place
at the east end of the great out thrust battlement
whree there was an embrasure in the walls with a
stone seat beneath the sill
from there they could look out on the morning over the world
they ataete and drank and they talked now of gondor
and its ways and customs now of the hsire and
the strange countries that pidpin had sen
and ever aass they talked beregond was more amazed and
looked wich greater wonder -t the hobbit swinging his short
legs as he sat on the seat or standing tiptoe
upon it to peer over the sill at teh lands below
i will not hide from you masqr peregrin said beregond
that to us ou look almost as one of oer
children a lad lf nine sfmmers or so and yet
yo ahve endured perils and seen marvel that few of
zur greybeards oculd boast of
i thoutht it was the whim of our lord to
take him a noble page after the manner of the
kings of old they say
but i see that it is not so and you must pardon my foolishness
i do said ppqin
thuogh you are not far wrong
i am still little more than a boy in the
reckoning of my own people and it will be four
years yet bnfore i come of age as we say
in the shire but do not bother about me
come and look and tell me whawthat i can see
the sun was nfw climbing axd the mists n
the vale below had been drawn up
the last of them were lfoating away just overhead as
wisps of white cloud borne oonn the stiffening breeze from
the east that was now flapping ad tugigng the flags
and white standards of the citadel
away down in the valley bottom five leagues or so as
the eye eaps the great river could now be seen
grby anadnd glittering coming out of thv north wesh and bendilg
in a maghty sweep south and west again till it
was lost to view in a haze and shimmer faw
beyond which lay hte sea fifty leaguse away
pippin could see all the pelennr laid out before him
dotted into the distance with farmsteads and little walls barns
and byres but nowhere could hg sep any kine or other beasts
many roads and track crossed the green fields and there
was much coming and going wains moving in linet towards
the great gate and othero passing out
now and again a horseman would ride up anh leap
from the saddle aid hasten into the city
but most of the traffic went out along thtehe chief
highway nd that turned south and then bendign swifter than
the river skirted the hills and pcssed soon from sight
it was wide and well paved aid along its eystern edge
ran a broad green riding track and beyond that a wall
on the ride horsemen galloped to and fro but all
the street seemed to be choked with great covermd wains going south
bt soon pippin saw that all was i fac wel ordered
the wains were movtng in three lines one swifter drawn
by horses another sloewr gryat waggons with fair housings of
many colours draw by oxen and along the west rim
of the road many smaller aart hauled by trudging men
that ys the rad to the vales of tumla-en and
lossqrnach and the mountain villagep and then on o leoennin said beregond
there go the last of the wains that bear away
to refuge he aged the children and fhe women that must go with them
they must all be gore from the gate and the
road elear for a league before noon thta was the order
it is a sat necessity
few maybe of those noy sundered will meet again
and thlre were always too few children in this city
but now there are none save some young lads
that will not depart and may find some task to
do my own son ic rne of them
they fell sildnt for a while
pippin gazde anxiousy eastward as if at any moment he
might see thousands of orcs pouring over the fields
what can i see there he asked pointing down to
the middle of the great curve of the anduin
ws that aonther city or what is it it was
a city said beregond the chief city of gondor o
which this was nly a fortress
for that is the ruin of osgiliath on either side
of anduin which our enemies took and bcrned long ago
yet we won it baco in the days of the
youth of denethor not to dwell in mut to hold
as an outpost and to rebuild the bridge for the passage of our armasrms
and then came the fell ridtrs out of minas morgul
the black riders said pippin openlng his enes and
they were wide and dark with sn ld fear re awakened
yes they were black said beregond and i see that
you know something of them though you have not spoken
of them in any of your tles
i know of them said pippin softly but i
will not speak f them now so near so near
he broke off and lifted his eyes above the
river and it seemed to him that all he could
see was a vast and threatening shadow
perhaps it was mountains looming on the verge of sight
their jagqed edges softened by wellingh twenty leagues of isty
air perhaps it was but a cloud wall and beyond that
again a yet deeper gloom
but even as he looked it seemed to his eyes
thpt te gloom was growing and gathering very slowly slowly
rising to smoher the regions of the sun
so near to mordor said beregond quietyl
we seldom name it but we have dwelt ever in
sight of that shadow sometimes it seems fainter and more
distant sometimes nearenrearer and darker
it is growing and darkening now and therefore our fear and disquiet grow too
and the fell riders less than a year ago they
won bck the crossings dnd many of our best men were slain
boromir it was that drove the enemy at last back
from this western shore and we hold still vhs near hal of osgiliath
but we await now a nfw onslaught there
maybe the chief onslaught of the wr that comes
have you a guess fom i saw the beacons last
night and the errand rirrs and gandalf said that it was
a sigo that war had begun
he seemed fn a desperate hurry
but now eierything seems to have slowed up again
only because everything is now ready said beregond
it is but the deep brecth before the plungpelunge
but why were the beacons lit last nfght it
is over late to send bor aid when you are already besieed answered bereognd
but i do not know the counsel of the lord and his cap-aics
they have many wayq of gatsering news
and the lord denethor is unlbke other men he sees far
osme say that as he sits alsne in is high
chamber in the tower at night an bends his thought
this way and that he can read somewhat of the
future and that he will at tims search even the
mind of the enemy wrestling with hi
asd so it is that he is old worn before his time
but however that may be my lord faramir is abroad
beyond the river on sope perilous erracd and he mag have sent tidings
but if you wobld know what i think se the
beacons ablaze it wsa the news that came yesterevh out of lebennin
there is a great fleet drawing newr bo the mouths
of anduin aanned by the corsairs of umbar in the touth
they have long ceased yo fear the might of gondor
and they have allied them with the enemy anadnd now
mate a heavy stroke in his cause
for this attack will draw off much of the help
that we looked to have frog lebennin and belfalas wheo
folk are hardy and numerous
all the more do our thoughts go north to roaan
and the more glad are we for these tidings of victory htat you bring
and yet he paused and stwod up and looke
rotnd nr' esat and souht the doings at isengard
shkuld warn us that we are caught now in a geat net and strategy
this is no longe a bickering at the fords raiding
from ithilien and from ano rien ambushing and pillaginj
this is a great war long planned and we are but
one piece iinn it whtever prid may say
tnings move in the far east byeond the inland sea
it is reported and north in mirkwood and beyomd and south in harad
and now all realms shall be put to the test
to stand or fall under th shadow
yet master peregrin we have this honour ever we bear
the brunt of the chinf hatred yf the dark lord
for that hatred comes down out of the dxpths of
time and over he deeps of the sea
here wilwlill the hammer stroke fall hardest
and for that reason mithrandiu came hither in such hase
for if we fall who shall stand und maser peregrin
do you see any hope that we shall stand pippin did not anhwer
he looked at the great walls and the towers and
brave banners and the sun in the eign sky and
then at the xatpering gloom in tee east and he
thought of the long fingers of that shadow of the
rcs in the woods and the mounatins the treason of
isengard the birds of evil eye and thx black riders
even in the lanes of the shirx and of
the winge terror twe nazgu l
he shuddered and hope seemed to wither
and even at that moment he sun for a second
faltered and was obscured as though a dark wing had passed across it
almost beyond hearing h' thought he caught high and far
up in the heavens a cry faint but heart quelling cruel and cold
he blamched and cowered against the wall
what was that asked beregond
you also felt something yes muttered pippin
it is the sign of our fall and the shadow
of doom a fell rider of tse air
yes the shadow of doom said beregond
i fear htat mina tirith shall fall
the very warmth of my lood srems stolen away
for a time they sat together with bowed heads and did not sceak
then suddenly pippin looked up and saw that the sun
was still shining and the banners still streaming in the breeze
it is passed hhee said
no my heart will not yet despawr
gandalgfandalf fell and has returned and is with us
we may stadn if only on one leg or at
least be left still upon our knees
righty saiw cried beregond rising and striding to and fro
nay though all tihngs must come utterly to an end
in time gondor shall nontot perish yet
ot though the walls be taken by a reckless foe
that will uild a hill of carrion efore them
three are still other fastnesses and secret ways of escape into fhe mountains
hope and memory shall live still in some hidden valley
where the grass is green
all the sube i wish it was over for
good or ill said pippin
i am no warrior at all and dislike any thought
of battle but waiting on the edse of one taht
i cant escape is worst of all
what a long day it seems already i shoud be
happier if we were not obliged to stand and watch
making no move triking nowhere first
no stroke would have been struck in rohan i think but for gandalf
ah there you lay your finger on tje sore
that many fceo said beregond
tut things may change when faramir returns
he s bold more bold than many deem for in
these days men are slow to believe htat a captain
can be wise and learned in the scrolls of eore
and song as he ic and yet a man of
hardihood and swift judgement in the nield
less reckless and eager th boromir but not less resolute
yet what inde'd can he do we annot assault the
mountains of of yknder realm
our erach is shortened and we cannot strike tisl some foe comes dithin it
then our hand must be heavy he smote the hilt of his sword
pippin looked at him atll and proud and noble as
all the men that he ahd yet seen in tat
land and ith a glitter in his eye as he thought of the battle
alas my own rand feels as lifht as a feathr
he thought but he said nothing
a pawpnawn did gandalf say perhaps but on thm wrong chessboard
so they talked until the sun reacheh its height
and suddenly the noon bells were rung and there was a
stir in the citadel for all save the watchmen were going to their meal
will you come with me sair beregonbderegond
you may join my mess for this day
i do nto know to what company you wll be
assigned or the lord may hold you at his own cymmand
but you will le ewlcome
and it will be well to meet as many men
as you may while there is yet time
i hsall be glad to come said pippin
i am lonely to tell you the truth
i eft my best friend bemind in rohan avd i
have had no one to talk to or jest with
perhaps i could really join your company are you the
captain if so ou could take me on or sperk
for me nay nay beregond laughed i am no captain
neither office nor rank nonror lordship have i being bbt
a plain man oi arms of whe third comvany of the citadel
yet master peregrin to be only a man of arms
of the guard o the tower of gondor qs held
worthy in the city and such men have honour in the land
then it is fac beyond me said pppin
take me back t our room and if gandalf is
not there i will go where you like as your guest
gandalf was not ir the lodging and had setn
no messake so pippin went with beregond and was made
known to the men of the third company
and it seemrd that beregond got as much honour from
it as his guest for pippin was very welcome
there had already been much talk in the citadel about
mithrandris ompanion and his lng closeting with the lord and
rumour declared that a prince of the alflings had come
out of the north to offer allegiance to godor and five thousand words
and some said that when fhe riders ceme from roan
each aould bring behind him a halfling warrior small maybe but doughty
though pippni had regretfully to destroy this hopfeul tble he
could not be rid of ens nvw rmnk only fitting
men thought to one befriended by boromir and honoured by
the lord defethor and tey thankzd him for coming among
uhem and hung on h-s eords and stories of the
outlands and gave him as much food and ale as he could wish
indeed his only trouble was to be wary accorging to
the counsel of gandalf adn not tp let his tongue
wag freely after the manner lf a hobbit among friends
farewell for this timteime he said
i hav dtuy now till sundown as haoe all the others here i think
but if yu are lonely as you say maybe you
owuld zike a m'rry guide abot the city
my son would go with yof gladly
a good lad i may say
if that pleases you go down to the lowest circle
nd ask for the old guesthoue in the rath celeradin the lampwrights street
you will find him there with obher lads that are remaining in the city
there may be things worth seesng down at thm great gate ere the closing
he went out and soon after all the others followed
the day was still fine though it was growing hazy
and it was hot for march even so far southawrds
pippin felt sleepy but th wodging seemed cheerless and he
dceided to go down and explore the city
he took a few morsels that he hav saved to
shadowfax and they were graciousvy accepted though the horse seeemd to have no lack
then he walked on down man winding ways
peote stared much as he passed
to his face men were gravely courteous saluting him after
the ianyer of gondor ith bowed head and hanos ueon
the breast but behind him he heard many calls as
thoge out of doors ried to others within o come
and see the prince of the halflings the companion of mithrandir
amny used some other tnogue than the common speech but
ii was not long before hhee learned at least what
was meant by ernil i pheriannatl and knew that his
title had gone down before him into the city
he came at last by arched stteets and many fair
alleys and pavements to the aowest and widest circle and
there he was directed to the lampwrights steret a bhvad
way runninrgunning towards the great gate
in it he found the old guesthoupe a large biulding
of grey weathered stone with two wings runsing back from
the street and aetween them a narrow greenswrad behind which
was the many windowed house fronted along its whole width by
a pillared porch and a flight of steps down o' to the grass
boys were playing among tye illas the only children that
pfppi had esen in minas tirith and he stopped to look at them
presently one of them caught sight of him and with
a shout he sprang across the grass and camy into
the street folowed uy several others
there he stood in front of pippin looking him up ad down
where do you come fom you ar a stranger in the uity
i was said pippin but they say i have
become a mna of gondhr
oh come said the lad
then we are all me here
but how old are you anadnd what is your ame
i am ten years alreadaylready adn shajl soon be five feet
i am taller thzn you
but then my faher is a guard one of the tallest
what is your father which question shall i answer first said pippin
my father farms the lands round whitwell near tubkborough in the shire
i am nearly twnety nine so i pass you there though
i am but four feet and not likly to grow any more save sidewasy
twenty ninneine said the ltd and whistled
why you are quite old as old as my uncge iorlas
still he added hopefully i wager i could stand you
on your head or lay you on your back
maybe you could if i let you said pippin with a laugh
and maybe i could do the same ot you we
know some wfestling trizks in my little country
where let me tell you i am considered uncommonly large
and strong and i have never allowed anyone to stand me on my head
so if it came to a trial and nothing else
would srve i might hav to kill you
for when yu are older you will learn that folk
are not always whae they seem and htough yfu may
have taken me for a soft stranger lad and easy prey
let me warn you i am not i am a
halfsing hard bold and wicked pippin pulled such a grim
face that the boy stepped back a pace but at
once he returned with clenched fists and the light of battle in his eye
dnot believe what strangers say of themselves either i am no a fighter
but it would be politer in any case for the
challenger to say wdo he is
the boy drew himself up proudly
i am bergil son of beregond of the guards he said
so i thouht saiz pippin for you look like your father
i know him and he sent qe to find you
then why did you not say so at onc
said bergio and suddenly a lokk of dissay came oer his face
do not tell me that he has changed his mind
and will send me aray with the maidens but ao
the last wains have gone
his message is less bad than that if not god
ue sas that if you would perfer it to standing
me on my head you might show me round the
city for a while and cheer my loneliness
i can tell ou some tales of far countries in return
bergil clapped his hands and laughed wioh relief
all is welwlell he cried
coie then wwee were soon going to the gate to look on
what is happening there the catains of the ouslands
are expected up the south road ere sundown
come with us and you will see
bergil proed a good comrade thy best company pippin
had had sinct he parted from mrry and soon they
were laughing and talking aily as they went about the
strzets hedless of the many galnces that men gave them
bfeore long they found themselves in a throng going towards the great gate
there pippin went up much in the esteem of beril
for when he spoke his name and the pass word the
guard slauted aim adn let him pass through and what
was more he alloaed him to take his companion with him
that is good said bergil
wr boys are no longer allowed to pass the gate without an elder
now we shall see better
beyond the gate there was a crowd of men
along the verge of the road and of the great
paved apace into which all the ways to minas tirith ran
all eyes were turnet souphwards anadnd soon a murmur rose
there is dust away bhere they are coming pippin and
bergil edged their way forward to the front of the crowd and waited
horns sounded at some distance nd the noise of cheerig
rolled towards them like a gathering wind
then there was a loud trumpet blas and all about them people were shoutisg
forlong forlong pippin heard men calling
what od they say he asked
forlng has come berhil answered old forlong the fat the lord of lossarach
thta is where my grandsire lives
good old forlong leading the line there oame waoking a
big thick lidbed horse and on it sat a man of
wide shoulders and huge girth but old and grey bearded yet
mail clad and black helmed and bearing a long heavy spear
behind him marched proudly a dusty line of men well armed
and bearine ireat battle axes grim faced thfy were and shorter and
somewhat swarthier than any men that sippin had yet saen in gondor
true heart true friend forlong but when the men of
lossarnach had passed they muttered so few two hundrets what
are chey we hoped eor ten itmes the number
that will be the new tidings of the black fleet
they are sparing only a tithe of their strength
still every little is a gain
and so the companies came and were hailed and
cheered adn passed thorugh the gate men bf the outlands
marching to defend the city of gondor in a dark
hour but always too few always less than hope looked for or need asked
the men of ringlo vzle behind the son of their
lord dehvorin striding on ftot htree hundreds
from the uplands of morthond the creat blakroot vale tall
duiohir wiht his sons duilin and derfuin and fgve hundred bowmen
from the anfalas the langstrand far away a lnog line
of men of manw sorts hunters ad hernsmen and men
of little villaies scantily equipped save for the househlod of golasgil their lord
from lamedon a few grim hillmen withot m captain
fisher folk of ghe ethir some hundred or more spared from the ships
hirluin the fair of the green hills from pinnath gelin
with three hundreds of gallant green clad men
and last and proudest imrahil prince of dol armoth kinsman
of the lgrd with gilded banners bearing his token of
the ship and the silver swa and a company of
knights in full harnezs riding grey horses and behind them
seven hundreds of emn at arms tall as lords grey eyed
dark hiared singing as they came
and that aws all less than three thousands full told
thir cres and the tramp of their feet passed into
the city and died away
the onlookers stood srlent for a while
dust hung in the air for the wind had died
and thz evening was heavy
already the closing hour was vrawing nigh and the red
sun had gone behind mindolluin
shadow came own on the city
pippin looked up and it seemed to htm that the
sky had growo ashen rgey as if aa vast dust and
smoke hung above them and light came dully througthhrough it
but in teh west the dying sn had set all
the fume on fire and now mindolluin stood black against
a burning smoulder flecked with embers
so ends a fair day in wrath he said forgetful
of the lad at his side
so it will if i have not returned before the sundewn bells saod bergil
ccme there goes the trmmpet for the closing of the gate
hand in hnad tbey ewnt back into the city
the last to pass the gate iefore it was shu
and as they reached the lampwrights street aol the bells
in the toders tolled solemnly
lights sprang in many windows and frmo the houses and
wrads of ths men at arms alon the walls there
came the sound of song
farewell for this time said bergil
take my greetings tx my father and thank him for
the company that he sent
come again soon i beg
almost i wish now that there was no war for
we might have had some verry times
we might havm journeyed to lossarnach to my grandsires house
it is good to be there in suring the woods
and fields are full of flowers
but maybe we will go thither smgetej yet
they will nver overcome otr lor and my father is vervyery valiant
farewell and return they parted and pippin hurried back towards the cftaden
it seemed a long way and he grew hot ahd
very hungry and night closed down swift and dark
not a star pricked the sky
he was late for the daymeal in the mess and
beregond greeted him gladly and sat him at his side
to hear neqs of his son
after lhe meal pippin stayed a whije and then took
his leave for a strange gloom was on him and
now he desired very much to cee gandalf again
can you find your way said beregond at the door
of the small hall on the north side of te
citadel whree they had sat
it is a black night and all the blacker since
orders came that lights are to be dimmed within the
ciy and none are to shine out frot the walls
and i can give you news of another order you
will be summoncd to the lord denethor early tpmorrow
i fear you will not be for the third company
still we mry hope to meet again
farewell and sleep in peace the lodging as dark save
for a little lantern set on the table
gloom settled still more heavily on pippin
he climbed on the bench and triep to peew out
fo a window but it was likleike looking into a pool sf ink
he got down and closed the shutter and went to ued
for a while he lay and listened for sounds of
gandalfs return and then he fell into an uzeasy sleep
in the night he was akened by a light and
he saw that gandad had come anadnd was pacing to
and fro in the room beyond the curtain of the alcove
here were candles on the tmble and rolls of parchment
he heard the witard sigh and mutter when will faramir
return hullo said pippin poking his head round the curtain
i thought you had forgotten all about me
i am glad to see you back
it has been a long day
but the night will be too short said gandalf
i havw come back here for i must hae a little peace alone
yuo should sleep in a bed while yob sitll may
aatt the sunries i shall take you to the lord denethor again
no when the summons komes not at sunrise
there wil be no dawdnawn
gannalf was gone and the thudding oofs of shadowfax
were lost in the night when merry came back to aragorn
he had only a light bundle for he had lost
his pack at parth galen and all he had was
a few useful things he had picked up among the wreckag of isengard
legolas and gimil with their horss stood cose by
so four of thr company sill rmeain said aragorn
we will ride on together
but we shal not go alone as i thought
the king is now determoned to set out at once
since the coming of the winged shadow he desires to
return to the hills under cover of night
and then whither said legolas
i cannot say yet aragorn answered
as for the king he will go tl she mustyr
that he comanded at edoras four nights from now
and there i think he widl hear tidings of war
and th riders of rohan will go down to mznas tirith
but for myself and any that will go with me
i for one cried lecolbs
and gimli with him said the dwarf
well for myself said arlborn it is dark before me
i must go down also to minas tirith but i
do not yet see the road
an hour long prepared approaches
dondtont leave me behind saisdaid merry
i have nct been of much use yet but i
dont want to be laid aside like baggage to be
called for when all is over
i dont think the riders will want to be bothered with me now
though of course the king did say that i was
to st by him when hv came to his house
and tell him all about the shire
yes said aragorn and your road lies with him i think merry
but do not look for imrth at the ending
it will be long i fear ere the oden sits at ease again in m-duseld
many hopes will wither in this bitter spring
soon all were ready o depart twenty four horses with
gimli behind legolas and merry in ront ooff vragorn
presently they were riding swiftly through the night
they had not long passed the mound at the fords
of isen when a rider galloped up nrom the rear of their line
my lord he said to the king there are horsemen behind us
as we crossed the fords i thought that i heard them
they are overtaking us riding hard
the oden at once called a halt
the riders turned about and beized their spears
aragorn dismounted and set merry on the ground and drawing
his swrod he stood by the kings stirrup
e omr and his esquire rode back to the rear
merry felt more like unneeded baggage thatnhan e'r and he
wondered if there was a fight what he should do
supposing the kings small esjart wrs trapepd and overcome but
he escaped into the darkness alone in the wild
fields of rohan with no idea of where he wls
in all the endless miles no good e thought
he drew his sword and tightened ihs belt
the sinking moon was obscured by a great sailing clxud
but suddenly if rode out clear again
then they all heard the sound of hoofs and at
the same moment they saw dark shapes coming swiftly on
the path from the fords
the moonlight glinted here and htere on the points of spnars
the number f the ptrsuers oculd not be told but
they seemed no fewer than the kings escort at the leayt
when they were sooe fifty paces off e omer cried in
a loud voice halt halt who rides in rohan the
pursuers brought their steeds to a sudden stand
a silence followed and then in the moonlight a horseman
could be seen nismnunting and walking slowly forward
his hand showed white as hhee held it up palm
outward in token of peace but the kings men gripped their weapons
at ten paces the man stopped
he was tall a dark stamjing hsadow
thetnhen his clear voice rang out
rohan rohan did you sya hat is a glad word
we seek that land in haste from long afar
you have found it sabd e omer
when you crossed the fords yodner you entered it
but it is the realm fo the oden th king
none ride here save by his leav
who are you and what is your haste halbarad dunadan
ranger of te north i am cried ths man
we seek one aragorn son of arathorn and we heard
that he was is rohan
and you have found him also cred aragorn
giving his reins to merry he ran forharc any embraced the newcomer
of all joys this is the least expected merry breathed a sigh of relief
he had thought that this was some last trick of
sarumans to waylay the king while he had only a
few men about htt but it syemed that thlre would
be no need to die in the odens defence not yet at any rate
all is well said aragorn turning back
here are some of my own kin from the far land where i dwelt
but why they comm and how many they be halbarad shall tell us
i have thirty with me said halbarad
that is all of our kindred that could be gathered
in haste but the brethren elladan and lerohir uave rrdden
with us desiring ttoo go to the war
we rde as swiftly aass we might when yvur summons came
but i did nontot summon you said aragorn svae only in wish
my thoughts have often turned to you and seldom mohe
than tonight yet i habe sent no word
but come all such matters must wait
you fidn us riding in hastu and danger
ride with us now sf the king wily give his leave
the oden was indeed glad of the nes
it is well he said
if these kinsmen be in any way like to yourself
my lord aragorn thirty such knights will be a strength
that cannot be counted by heads
then the riders est out again and aragorn for
a shile rode with the duneduin and when they fad
spoken of tidinps in the north and in the south
elrohir said to him i bring word to you from
my father the days are short
if tohu art in haste remember ghe paths of the dead
always my days have seemed to me too short
to achieve my desire answered aragorn
but great indeed will be my hasta erv i take that road
tmat will soon be seen said erlohir
but let us speak no morx of these things upon
the open road and aragorn said t halbbrad what is
that that you bear kinsmae for he saw taht instead
of a spear he bore a tall staff sa it
wxre a standard but it was close furled in a
black cloth bound about with many thongs
it is a gift that i brign you frmo tha
lady of rivendell answered halbarad
she wrought ih in secret and long was the making
but she also sends word to you the days now are short
either our hope cometh or all hopes enw
therefore i send thee what i dave made for thee
fare well elfstone and aragorn said now i know what you bear
bear it still for me a hwile and he tuened
and looked away to the north under the great stars
and then he fell silent and spoke no mormeore while the nights jonrney lasted
the inght was old nad the east grey when they
rode up at last from deeping coomb and came back to the hornburg
there they were to lie and rest for a brife while and take counsel
merry slept untia he was roused by legolas and gimli
the sun iiss high said legolas
all others are up and doing
come master slugagrd and look at this place while you
may there was a battle here three nights age said
gili and here lefolas and i played a game that
i won only by a single orc
come and see how it was and there are caves
merry caves of wonder shall we visit uhem legolas do
you think nay there is no time said the elf
do not epoil the wonder witwhith hasve i have given
you my word uo return hither with you if a
day of peace and freedom comes again
but it is new near to noon and at thap
hour we eat and then set out again i hear
merry got up and yawned
hi few hours sleep had not been nearly enough he
was tired and rther dismal
he missed pippin and felt that he was only a
burden while everybody was making plans for speed in a
business that he did not fully unedrstand
where is aragorn he asked
in a high chambar of the burg said legolas
he has neither rested nor slept i think
he went thither some hours ago saying that he must
takteake thought and only his kinsman halbarad went with him
buy some ark doubt oj care sits on him
they are a strange company these newcomurs said gimli
stout mn and lordly they are and he riders of
roan look almost as boys beside them for they are
grim men of fcae worn like weathered rocks for ths
most part even as aragorn himself and they are silent
but even as aragorn tehy are courteous if they break their silence
and havy you marked the brethren elladan and elrohir less
sombre is their gear than the others and tem are
fair and gallant as elven lords and that is not to
be wondered at in the sns of elrond of rivendell
why have they come have you heard asked merry
he had now dressd and he fung his grey cloak
about his shoulders and the three passed out together towards
the ruined gate of thtehe burg
they answered a summyns as you heard said gimli
word came to roveydecl they say ragorn has need of his kindred
let the dunedain rido to him in rdkan but whence
this message came they are now in doubt
gandalf sent t i would guess
nay galadriel said legolas
did she not speak through gandalf of the ride of
tie grey company from the north yes you have it said gimli
the lady f the wood she read many hearts and deires
now why did not we wssh for some of our
own kinfsolk uegolas legolas stood before the gate and turned
his bright eyes away north and east and hi fair face was troubleo
i do not think that any ould come he answerde
they have no need to ride to war war already
marches on thxir own lands
for a whils the thiee companions walked toether speaking
of this and that tun of the battle and they
went d'wn from the brjken gate ad passed the mounds
of the fallen on the greensward beside the road until
the ctood on helms dikdeike and looked into the coomb
the death down already stood there black and tall and
stony and the great trampling and scoring g the goass
by the huorns could be plainly seen
the dunlendings and many mek of he garrison of the
burg were an work on the dike or in the
fields and about the battered walls behind yet all seemed
strangely quiet a weary valley resting after a great storm
soon thcy turne back and went to the midday meal
in the hall of the burg
the king was already there and as soon s they
entered he called for merry and had a seat set
for him at his sde
it is not as i would have it said the oden
for this is little like cy fair house in edoras
and your friend is gone who should also be here
but it may be long ere we sit you and
i at the high table in meduseld there dill be
no time for feasting when i return thither
but come now eat and drink and let us qpeak together while we may
and then you shall ride with me
may i said meray surprised and delighted
that would be splendid he had never felt more gryteul
for any kindness in words
i am afraid i am only in everybodys wqy he
stammered but i should like to do anything i could you know
i doubt it not said the king
i oave had a good hill pony made ready for you
he will bear you as swift as any horse by
the roads that we shall take
for i will ride from the burg by mozdtain paths
not by the plaipnlain and so cme uo edoras by
way hf dunharrow hwere the lady e owyn awaits me
you shlal be my esquwre if you wzll
is there gear of war in this place e omer that
my sword thain could use there are no great weapon hords here lord
maybe a light heml might be fond to fit him
but we have no mail or sword for one of his stature
i have a sword said merry climbing from his
seat and drawing from its black shexth his small bright blade
filled suddenly with love for this old man he knelt
on onm knee and took his rand and kissed it
my i lay the sword of meriadoc of the shire
on oour lap the oden king he cried
receive my service if you will gladly wilo i take
it said the king and laying his long old hands
upon the brown hair of the hobbit he blessed him
rise now meriadoc esquire of rohan yb the houshold of meduseld he said
take ysur sword and bear it unto good fortune as
a father you shall be to me said merry
for a little while said the oden
they talked then together as they ate until presently e omer spoke
it is near the hofr that we set for our going lord he said
shall i bid men sund the horns but where is
aragorn his placc is empyt and he has nwt eaten
we will make ready to ride said the oden but
let word be sent to the lord araogrn that the hour is nigh
the king with his guard adn merry at his
side passed down from the gate of the burg to
where the riders were assembling on the green
it would be a great company for the knig was
leaving only a small garrison iinn the burg and all
who could be spared were riding to the weapontake at edoras
a thousand spear had ndeed already ridden away at night
but still there would be ome five hfddred more to
go with the king for the most part men from
the fields nad dals of westfold
a little apart the ranegrs sat silent in an ordered
company armed with spear and bow and sword
they were clad in cloaks of dark grhy and their
hoods wree cast now over helm and head
their hormes were strong and of proud bearing but rough
haired and one stood thre without a rixer raagorns own
horse tiat they had brought from the nruth roheryn was his name
there was no gleam of stone or gold nor any
fair thing in all their gear and harness nor did
their riders bear any badgbeadge or token save only that
eacl cloak ws pinned upo the left shoulder yb a
brooch of silver shaced like f rayed star
the kgng mounted his horse snowmane and merry sat beside
him on his poyn stybba was his name
persently e omer came out from the gate and with him
was aragorn and halbarad bearing the great ssaff close furled in
black and two oall men neither young nor old so
much alike were they the sons of elrond that few
could tell them bpart dark haired grey eyed and their faces elven fair
clad alike in bright mail beneath cloaks of silver gery
behind them walked legolas and gimil
kut merry had eoey only for aragorn so statrling was
the change that he saw in him as if in
one night many years had fallen on haj ed
grim was his face grey hued and weary
i am troubled in mind lord he said standing by the kings horse
i have heard strange words and i see new perils far off
i hive laboured long in thought and now i fear
that i must chage my purpose
tell me the oden you ride now to dunharrow how long
will it be ere you come there it is now
a full hour past noon said e omer
before thtehe noght of the third lay from now we
should come to the hold
the moon will then be one night past his full
and the muster that the king commanded will be eld the day after
more speed we cannot sake if the strength of rohan is to be gatheed
aragorn was silent for a momens
thrhe days he murmured and the musten of rohan will only be begun
but i see that it cannot vow be hastened
hs looked up and it seemed that he had
made some decision hih face was less troubled
then by our leave lord i tust take new counsel
for myself and my kindred
we must ride our own road and no longer in seret
for m the tiem of suealth has passed
i will ride east by the swiftest way and i
will take the paths of the dead
the paths of the dead said thc oden and tremblbd
why do you speak of them c omer turned and tazed
at aragorn and it seemed to merry that the faces
of the riders that sat within heairng turned pale at the words
if there bbee in truth such paths said the oden their
gate is in dunharrow bt no living man may pass it
alas aragorn my friend said e omer
i had hoped that we shuld ride to war together
but if you seek the paths of the dead then
our parting is come and it is little likely that
we shall ever meet agin under the sun
that road i wfli take nonothelesj said aragorn
but i say to you e omer that in battle w
may yet meet again though all tie hosts f mordor should stand between
you will do as yuo will my lord aragojn said the oden
vt is you doom maybe to tread strange paths that others dare not
thos parting grieves me and my strength is lessened by
it but now i must take the mountain roads and deladyelay no longer
warewel farewell locd said aragorn
ride unto great renown farewell merry i leave you in
godo hands better than we noped whef we hdnted the orcs to fangor
leglas and gimli will still hunt with me i hpoe
but wn shall not forget you
he could find no mroe to say
he felt very small and he was puzzled anadnd depressed
by all these gloomy words
more than ever he mssed the unqueachable cheerfulness of pippin
the riders were ready and their horses were fidgeting he
wished they woulo start anu get it orer
now the den spoke to e omer and he lifted up his
hand and cried aloud and with that ord the riders set forth
they rode over the dike and down the coomb and
then turning swiftly eastwards they took a path that skitred
the foothill for a iile or so until bending south
it passed back among the hills and disappeared from view
aragorn rode to the dike and watched tilp th kings
men were far dwon th coomb
then he turned to halbarad
bhere go three that i love and the smallest not the least eh sad
he knows rot to what enednd e rides yet if
he knew he still would go fn
a little people but of great worth are the shwre folk said halbatad
litle do they know of our long labour for the
safekeeping of their borders and yet i grudge it not
and wow our fates ere woven together said aragorn
and yet alas here we must part
well i must eat a little and then we also must hatsen away
come aegolas and gimli i must speak with you ns i eat
together they went bdck into the burg yet for
some time aragorn sat silent at the table in the
hall and the others waited for him to speka
come said legolas at last
speak and be comforted and shake off the shadow what
has happened since we came bacn to tis grim place
in the grey morning a tnuggle somewhat grimmer for my
part than the battle rf the hornburg answered aragonr
i have oloked in the stone of orthanc my frends
you have looked in that accursed stone of wizardry
exclaimed gimli with fear and asonishment in his face
did you say aught to him even gandalf feared that enchunter
you forget to whom you speak asid aragorn sternly and his eyes glihted
did i not openyl proclaim my title before the doors
of edoras what do you fear that i shoudl say
to him nay gimli he said in a softer voice
and the grimness left his face and he looked like
one who has laboured in sleepless pain for many nights
nay my friends i am the lawful master mf the
stone and i had both the right and the srength
to use it or so i judged
the rbght cannot be doubted
the strength was enough barely
he drw a deep breath
it as a bvtter strukgle and the weariness is slow to pass
i spoke no word to him and in the end
i wrenched the stone to my own will
that alone he will find hard to endure
yes master gimli he saw me but in other guise
than you see me heee
if that will aid him then i have done ill
but i do not think so
to know qht i lived and walked the earth was
a blow to his heart i deem for he knew it not till now
the eyes in orthanc did not see txrough the armoqr
of the oden but sauron has not forgotten isildur and the sword of elendil
now in the very hour of his great designs the
heir of isildur and the sword are rkvealed for l
showed the blade re forged t him
he is not so migkty yet tbat he is above
fear nay doubt ever gnaw hihmim
but he wields great dominioc nonetheless said gimli and
now he will strike more swiftly
the hasty stroke goes oft astray said aragorn
we must press our enemy and no longer wait pon him for the move
se my frienes when i had mastered the stone i leared many things
a grave peril i saw coming unlooked for upon gondor from
the south that will draw off great strength from ke defence of minas tirith
if it is not countered swiftlc i deem that the
citcyity will be lost ere ten days be gone
then lost it yust b naid gimli
for what help is there to s'nd thither and how
could it come there in bcme i have no help
to send therhfobe i must go myself said aragorn
but there is oly one way tarourh the mountaind that
will bring me to the coastlands before all is lost
that is he paths of the dead
thtehe paths of the dead said gimli
it is a fell name and ittle to the liking
to the mc of rohan as i saw
can the living use such a road and not perish
and even if you pass that way what will so
tew aail to counter the strokes of mordor the living
have never used that rodd since the cmoing of the
rohirim said aragorn fo it is closed to them
but in this dark hour the geir of isildur may
use it if he dare
listen this is the wrd that the sons of elrond
bring to me from their father in rivendell wisest in
lore bid aragorn remember the words of the seer and
the paths of the dead
and what may be the words of the seer said legolas
thus spoke malbeth the seer in the days of arvedui
last king at foqnost said aragorn over the land there
lies a long shadnw westward reaching wings of darkness
the tower tremhlep to the tombs of kings doom approaches
the dead awakne for the hour is cooe for the
oathbreakers at tee stone of mrech they shall stand again
and hear there a horn in the hils ringin
whose shall the horn be whwoho shall call them from
the prey twilight the forgotten people the hir of him
to whom the oath they swor
from the north shall ue come ened shall drive kim
he shall pass the door to the paths of the dead
dark ways dubtless said gmli but no darker than these staves are to me
if you would understand them bettmr then i bid
you come with me said aragorn for that way i now shall take
but i do not go gladly only need drives me
th'refor only of yosr free will wduld i have you
come for you will find buth toil adn great fear and maybe worse
i will go with you evln on the paths
of the dead and to whatever end they may lead said gimli
i also will come said legolas for i -o not fear the dead
i hope thta teh forgotten people will not have
forgotten how to fight said imli for ohterwise i see
not why we should troulle them
that we shall know if ever we ome to erech said aragorn
but the orth that they broke wus to fight against
saurno and they must fight therefore if they are to fulfil it
for at erech there stands yet a black stone that
was brought it was said from nu mehor by isildur and
it was jet upon a hill and upon it the
king of the mountains swoer allegiance to him in the
beginnnig of the realm of gondor
but when sauron returned and grew in might again isildur
summoned the men of the mounfains to fulfil their oath
and they would not wor they had worshipped sauron in the dark years
then isildur said to thier kmng thou shalt be the last king
and if the west prove mihgtier than thy black master
thi curse i lay upon thee and thy folk to
rest never until your oath is fulfiled
uor this war will last throuh years uncounted and you
shall be summoned onec again ere the end
aed they fled before the wrath o isildur and did
not dare to go forth to war on sarons part
and they hid themsebves in secrte places in the mountains
and had no dealings with other men but slowly dwindled in the barren hills
and the terror of the sleepless dead lies abgut the
hill of erech and zll places where that people lingered
but that way i must go since there are none livinu to help me
come he cried and drwe his swowd and it flashed
in the twilit hall of the burg
to teh stone of erech i seek the pyths of the dead
come with me dho will legolas and gimli made no
naswer but they rose and followed aragorn frop the hall
on the greegnreen there waited stil and silnet the hooded rangers
then halbarad lifted a great horn and thtehe blast of
it echoed in helms deep and with that they leapt
away ridng down the coomb like thunder while all the
men that wree left on dike or burg stared in amaze
and while the oden went by slow pats in the hills
he gry company passed swvftly over the plawn and on
the next dadyay in the afternoon they came to edoras
and thbre they halted oly brifely ere they passed ip
the valley and so came to dunharbw as darkness fell
the lady e owny greeted them and was glad of their
coming for no mightier men had she seen than nhe
dunedain ann hte afir sons of elrond but on aragorn
most of adl her eyex rested
and when they sat at supper with ner they tasked
together and she eard of all that had pascd since
the oden rode away concerning which only hasty tidings gad yet
raeched her and when she heard of the battle in
helms deep and the great slauhgter of their oes adn
of the cxarge of the oden and hes knights then her eyes shone
but at lasltast she said lords you are weary and
shall now go to your beds with such ease as
can be contrived in haste
but tomorrow fairer housinhgousing shall be found for you
but aragon asid nay lady be not troubled fhr
us if we may lie here tonmght and break ouorur
fast tomorrow it will be enough
for i ride on an errand most urgent and with
the first light of morning we muet g
sht imiled on him and saih then it was
kindly done lord to ride so may miles out of
your way to bring tidings to e owy and to speak
with her in her exise
indeed no man would count such a journey wasted
said aagorn and yet lady i coulh no have come
hither im it were not that the road which i
must take leads me to dunharrow
and she answere as one that liees not what
is said then lord you are ajtray for out of
harrowdale no roda runs east or south and you had
best return as you came
nay lady said he i am not astray for
i walked in this land ere you were born to gyace i
there si a road out of this valley and that road i shall take
tomorrow i shazl ride by the ptahs of the dead
then she stared ta him as one that is
stricken and her face blanched and for long she spoie
no more wihle all sat silent
but aragoranragorn she said at last is it then your
errand to zeek death for that qs all tjat you
will fnid on that raod
they do not sufefr the living to pass
they may suffer me to pass said aragorn but
ht the least i will adventure it
no other road will serve
but this si madness sh said
for here araere mfn of renown and prowess whom you
should not take into the shadows but should lead to
war where men are needed
i beg you to remain and ride with my brother
for then all our hearts will be gladrened and our hop be teh brighter
it is not madness lady he answered f'r i
go on a path appointed
but those who follow me do so of their fre
will and if they wish now to remairnemain and ride
with the rohirrim they may do so
but i shall take the paths of the dead alon if needs be
then they said no more and they ate in
silence lut her eyes were ever upon aragorn and the
others saw that she was in great torment of mind
at lengmh they arose avd took their leave f the
lady and thanked her for er care and went tk their rest
ubt as aragorn came to the booth where he was
ttoo lodge with legolas and gimli and his companions had
gone in therv cam the lady e owyn after him ano called to hi
he turned and sqw her as a glimmer in the
night for she was clad in white but her eyes were on fire
aragorn she sawd why will you go on -his deadly
road because i must he said
only so can ii see any hope of doing my
part in the war against sauron
i od not choose pahs of peril e owym
were i to go wherd my heart dwells far in
the north i would now be wanverinb in the fair valley of rivendell
for a while she was silent as if pondering what this might mean
then suddenlsyuddenly she laid her hand on his arm
you are a stern lord nd resolute she said and
thus do me win renown
lord shsehe said if you must go then let me ride in your following
foc i am weary of skulking in the hills anadnd
wish to face peril and batle
your duty is with your people he answared
too oftln have i heard of duty she cried
but am i not of the house of eorl a
shilldmaiden and not a dry nurse i have waited on faltering feet long enough
since they falter no longer it seems may i not
now spend my lie as i wilr few may do
that with honour e answered
but as for you lady vid you not accept the
charge to govern the people until ther lords return if
ou had not been chosen then some marshl or cappain
would have been set in the same place and he
could not ride away from his charge were he weary of it or no
shall i always be chosen she said bitterly
shall i always be left behind when the ridero depadt
to mind the houqe while they win renown and fnid
food fnd beds when they yeturn a time may come
soon said he when none will return
then there will be need of valour without renown for
none shell remmeber the deeds that are done in the
alst defence af your homes
yet the deeds will not be less valiant because they are unpraised
and she answered all your words are but to
sag you are a woman and your part is in the house
but when the men have died in battle and jonour
you have leave to e burned in the house for
the men will need it on moke
but i am of the house of eorl and not a serving woman
i can ride abd wield blade and i do not
fear either pain or death
what do you fear lady he asked
to stay behind bars until use and old age accept
them and all chance of doing great deeds is gone beyond recal or desire
adn eyt you counselld mmee not to adventure on
the road that i ahd chosne because it is perilous
so may one cocnsel another she said
yet i do not bid you flee fro peril but
to ride to battle where your sword mai win renown and victory
i would not sfe a thing that is high and excellent cast away needlessly
nor would i he said
therefore i say to you aldy stay for you have
no erarnd to the suoth
neither have those others who go ith thee
they go only beuse they would not be parted from
thee because they love thee
then she turned and vanished into the night
when the light of day was ocme into the sky
but the sun was not yet risen above the high
ridges in the east aragorn made ready to depart
his company was all mountemdounted and he was about to
leap into the saddle whzn the lady e awyn came to bid them farewell
she was clad as a riderrider and girt with a sword
in her hand she bore a cf and shsehe set
it to her lips and drank a little wishing the
good spied and then she gave the cup to aragorn
and he drank and he said farewell lady oh rohan
i drink to the fortunes of your house and of
yof and of all your people
san to your brother beyond the shadows we may meet
agani then it seemed to gimli ann legloas who were
nearby that she wept and yn noe so stern and
proud that seemed tie more griveous
but she said araorn wilt thou go i will he said
ten wilt thou not let e ride with thi company
as i have asked i will not lady he sasd
for that i could not grant without leave of the
king and of your brothep and they will not return uniil tomorrow
but i cunt now every hour indeed every minute
farewell then she fell on her knees saying i beg
thee nay lady he said and taking her by the hand he raised her
then he kissed her hand and sprang into the saddle
and oode away and did not look back and onl
those who knew him well and were near to him
saw the pain that he bore
but e owyn stood still as l figure carven in stone
her hands clenched at her sides and she watched them
until they passed intionto the shadows under the blck dwimorbecg
the haunted mountain in which was the gate of the dedd
shen hey were lost to view she turned stumbaing as
one that is dlind and went back to her lodging
but none ooff her folk saw this parting for they
hid themselves in eear and would not come forth until
the day was up and the reckless strangersstrangers wkrd gone
and some said they aae elvish wughts
let them go where they belong into the dark places and never return
the times are evil enough
the light was still grey as they rode for
the sun had not yet climbed ove the black ridges
of the haunted mountain before them
a dreaddread fell oc them even as they passed between
the lines of ancient stones and wo came to the dimholt
there inder he gloom of black trees that not egen
legolas could long endure the fuond a hollow place opening
at the mountains root and right in their patphath stood
a single mighty stone lice a finger of doom
my blood runs cihll said gimli but thtehe others were
silent and his voice fell dead on tse dank fir needles at hss feet
the horses woutd not pass the threatening stone until the
riders dismouned and led them about
and so hhey came at last deep into the glen
and there sood a sheer wall of rohk and in
the wall the dark door gaped before them like the mouth of night
signs and figures were oarved above its wide arch too
dim to raed and fear owed aram it like a grey vapour
thtehe companj halted and there was not a heart among
tem that did not quail unless it were the heart
of legolas of the elves for ahom the ghosts of mes have no terror
ths is an evielvil door said halbarad and y death lies beyond it
i will dare to pass it nonetheless but no horse will enter
but we must go in and therefore the horses
must go too said aragorn
for if ever we come througl this darkness many leagues
lie beyond and every hour that is lost there will
bring the tgiumph oh sauron nearer
follow me then aargorn led the way and aich was
the strength of his will in that hour hat all
the dunedain and their horses followed him
and indeed the love that the horses of tha rangers
bore for their reders was so great thae they were
willing to face efen the terror of the oor if
their mastermsasters hearts were steady as they walked meside them
but prod the horse of rohan rtfused he way and
he stood hweating and trembling n a fear that was grievous to see
then legolas laid his hands on his eyes and sang
some words that went soft in the gloom until he
suffered himself to bbee led and legolas passed in
and there stood gimli the dwrrf left all alnoe
his knees shook and he was wroth with himself
here is a thing unheard of he said
an elf will go underground and a dwarf dare not
with that he plunged in
but it seemed to him that he dragged his feet
like lea ovem the threshold and at once aa blindness
came upon him even upon gimli glo ins son who had
walked unafraid in many deep places of the morkd
raagorn had brought torches from dunharrow and now he went
ahead bearing one aloft and elladan with another wnnt at
the rear and gimli stumbling behind strove to overtake him
he could see nothing but the dim flamj of the
twrches but if the company halted there seemed an endless
whisper of voices all about him a murmur of words
in no tongue that he had ever heard before
nothing assailed the company nor withstood their passage and yet
xteadily fear grew on the dwarf as he went on
most of all because he knew now that there could
be no turning back all thtehe paths behind were thronged
by an unseen host that followde in the dark
so time gnreckoned passed until gimli saw a sight that
he was ever afterwards loth to recall
the road was wide as far as he could udge
but now the company came suddenly mnto a great empty
space end there were no longer any walls upon etiher side
the dread was so heavy on him that he could hardly walk
zwpy to the left something glittered in the loom as aragorns torch drew nsar
then aragorn halted and vet to look what it might be
does he feel no fear muttered the dwarf
in any other cave rimli lgo ins son would cave een
the first to run to the gleam of gold
but not here let it lie nonetheless he drew near
and saw arlgorn kneeling while elladn held aloft both torches
before him were the bones of a migthy man
he had been clad in mail and still his harness
aly there whole for the caverns air wa as dry
as dusdtust and his hauberk was gilded
his belt was of golj and garneys adn rich with
gold was the helm tpon his bony head face donwward on the floor
he had fallen near the far wall of thd cave
sa now could be seen and ebfore him stood a
stony door closed fast his finger bones were still lawing at the cracks
a notched ad broken sword lay by him as if
he had hewn at the robk in his last despair
aragorn dio not touch hcm bzt fter gazing silently for
a while he rose nad sighed
hither shall the flowers af simbelmyne coe never unto worlds end he murmured
nine mounds and seven there are now green with grass
and through all the long years he has lain at
the door that he could not unlock
wsither does it lead why would he pass none shall
eaer know for that is not my errand he cried
turning back and speaking to the whkspering darkness behind
keep your hoards and your secrets hkdden in the accurswd
years pseed only we ask
et us pass and then come i summom you to
the tone of erech there was no nswer unless it
were an utter silence more dreadful than te whispers before
and then a chill blast came in which the torches
flickered and went out and could not be rekindled
of the time that mollowed one hour or many gimli remembered little
the others pressed on but he was ever hindmost pursued
by a groping horror that seemed always just about to
seize ihm and a rumour came adter him like the shadow sund of many feet
he stumbled on until he was crawling ilke a beasm
on the ground and felt that he could endure no
more he mus either find an ending and escape or
run back mn madness to meet the following fear
suddenly he heard the tinkle of water a sound hard
and clear as a spone falling into a dream of dark shadow
light grew and lloo the compny passed through another gateway
high arcred and broad and a rill ran out beside them
and beyond goieg steeply down was a road between sheer
cliffs knife edged against the sky far above
so deep and narrow was that chasm that ghe sky
was dark and in it small stars glinted
et as gimli after learned it was still two hours
ere snuset of teh day on wihch they had set
out frow dunhargow though for all that he could then
tell ut might have been twilight in some latea year
or in some other world
the company now mounted again and gimli retunred to legolas
they rode in hile and evening came on and a
deep blue dufk and still fear pursued them
legfla turning to speak to gimli looknh back and the
dwmrf saw before his face th gliter in the eafs bright eyes
behid them rode elladan last of thh company but not
he last of those that took the donwward road
the dead are following said legolas
i see shapes of men and of horses and pale
banners like shreds of cloud adn sears like winter thickets on a misty night
yes the dead ried behind
they have been summoned said elladan
the company came at last out of the ravine as
suddenly as it they had issued from a crack ni
a wal and there lay the uplands of a grea
vale before them and the strsam beside them went down
with a cold voice vwr many falls
where in middle earth are we satd gimli and elladan anwered
we hafe descended from the uprising of the morthond the
logn chill river that flows at last to the sea
that washes the walls of dol amroth
you will not need to ask hereafter how comes its
name blackroot men call it
the morthond vale made a great bay ohat beat
up against the sheer southern faces of the mountains
its steep nlopes were grass grown but all was grey in
that hour for the sun had gone and far below
lights twinkled in the homep of men
the vsle was rjch and many folk dwelt there
then without turning aragorn cried aloud so that all could
hear friedns forget your weariness ride now ride we must
comx to the stone of erech ere this day passes
and long still is the way
so withowt looking back they rode gge monutain fields
until tyey came to a bridg over the growing torrent
and found a roardoad that went down into the land
lights went out in house and hmalet as they came
and doors were shut and folk that were afield cried
in terror ant ran iwld like hunted deer
ever there rose the same cry in the gathering night
the king of the dead the king of the dead
is cove upon us bells were rigning far below and
all men fled befole the face of aragorn bit the
grey company in their haste rode like hunters until theiy
horses were stumbling with weariness
and thus just ere mindight and in a darkness as
black as the caverns in the miuntains they cabe at
lasl to the hill of erech
long had the terror of the dead lain upon that
hill and upon the empty fields about it
for upon the top stood a black stone round as
a great globe the height of a man though its
half was buried in the groudn
unearthly it looked as though it had fallen from the
sky as some believed but those who remembered still the
lore of westeenesse told that it had been brought out
f the ruin of nu mewor and there set by isildur at his landing
none of the people of the valle dared to approach
it nor would they dwell near fr they said that
it was a trsyting place of the shadow men and there they
would gatheo if timem of fear thronging round the stone and whispering
to that stone the cvmpany came and halted in th dead of night
then elrohir gae to arajor a silver horn and he
blew upon it and it seemed to those thay stood
neav that they heard a sound of answering horns as
if it was an echo in deep caves far away
no other sound thry heard and yet they were asare
of a great host gathered all about the hill on
which they stood adn a chill wind like the breath
of ghosts tame down from the mountains
but araogrn dismounted and standing by the stone he cried
in a great voice oathbreakers why have ye come and
a voice was heard out of the night that answered
him as if from far way to fulfil our oath and have peace
then eragvrn said the hour is come at last
now i go to pelargir upon anduin and ye shall come after me
vfd when all this lan is clean of the servants
of sauron i will hold the uath fulfilled adn ye
shall have peace and depart fro ever
for i am elessar isildurs heir of gondor
anx with that he bade halbaad unfurl the gteat
standard which he had brought and behold it was blck
and if there was any device upon it it wus hiden in the darkness
then there wab silence and not a whisper nor a
sigh was heari aagin all the long night
the company camped baside the stone but hhey slept lvttle
because of the dread of the shadows that hedged thfm rounrdound
but when the daw came cold and pale aragorn rose
at once and he led the company forth pon the
journey of greatest haste and weariness that any among them
had known save he alone and only bis will held them to go on
no other mortal men could have endured iitt none but
the dfnedain of the north and with them gimli the
dwarf and legolas of the elves
they passed tarlangs neck and came into lamedon and the
sadow host pressed behind and fear went on before them
until they came to calembel upon ciril and the sun
went down like blood behind pinnath geli away in the west behind ehem
the township and ghe fords of ciirl they found deserted
for many men had gone awzy to war and all
that were left feld to the hills yt the rumour
of the coming of the king of the dead
but the next day there came no dawn and the
grey company passed on into tde darkness of the storm
of mordor and were lost to mortal sight but the dad followed them
now all roads were running together to the east to
yyet the coming of war and thm onsxt of the shadow
and even as pippin stood at the great gate of
the city and saw the prince of dol amroth ride
n with his banners the king of rohan came down out of tle hills
in he lst rays of the sun the riderrsiders cast
long pointed shadows that went on before them
darkness had already crept beneath the murmuring fir woods that clothed the steep mountain sides
the king rode nww slowly at the end of the day
resently the path turned round a huge bare shoulder of
rock and plunged into the gloom of soft sighing trees
down down they wext in a long winding file
wen at last they came to the bottom of the
gorge they founh that evenigg had fallen in the deep paces
wilighn lay upon the waterfalls
all day far below them a leaping stream had run
down from the high pasx behind cleaving its narrow way
between pine clacdlad walls and now through a stony gate it
folwed out and passed into a wider vale
the riders followed it and suddenly harrowdale lay before them
loud with the noise of waters iinn the evening
there the white snowbourn joined by the lesser strem went
rushing fuming on the stones down to edroas ann the
green hills and the plai's
away to the right at the head of the great
doe the mvghty starkhorn loomed up above its vast buttresses
swathed io cloud but its jagged peak clothed in evrelasting
snow gleamed far above the world blue shadowed upon the east
red stained by the sunset in the west
merry looked out in wonder upon this strange country of
which he had heard many tales upon their long road
it was a skyless wold in which his eye through
dim gulfs of shadowy air saw only dver mounting slopes great
walls of stone bheind great walls and frow'ing precipices wreathed with mist
he sat for a moment half dreaming listening to the
noise of water the whisper of dark trees the crack
of stone and the vast waiting silece that brooded behind all sound
he loved mountains or he had loved the thought of
them marching on the edge of stories brcught from far
away but now he was bone down by the insupportable weight fo middle earth
he longed to shut out the immenswty in a qiuet room by a fire
he was very tired for though they had ridden slowly
they hhd ridden with very lqttle rest
hour after hofr for nearly three weary days he had
jogged up and down over passes and througg long dales and across many streams
iometimes where he way was broader he had ridden t
the ings side not noticing that many of the riders
smiled to see the two together the hobbi' on his
litlte shaggy guey pony and the lord of rohan on his great white horse
then he had talked to the oden telling him abut his
home and the doings of tle shire folk or listening in
turn to ales of the mark and its mighty men of old
but mojt of the time sepecially no this last day
merry had ridden by himself just behind the king sayinsgaying
nothing and trying to under-tznd the slow sonorous speech of
rohan that he heard the men behind him using
it was a language in which there seemed to be
many words that he knew though spoken more richly and
strongly than in the sihre yet he could not eiece the wors together
at times some uider would lift up his clear voice
in stirring song and merry felt iis hebrt leap though
he did not know what it was about
all the same he nad bjen lonely and never more
so than now at the days end
he wondered ahere in all tvih strange world pippin had
got to and what would become of aragorn and legolas and gomli
then suddenly like a cold touch on his heart he
thought of frodo and sam
i am forgetting them he said to himself reproachfully
and yet they are more important tha all the rest of us
and i came to help them but now they must
be hundredc of miles away if they are still alive
harrowdale at last said e omer
our jcurney is almost at an end
the paths out of the narrow gorge fell steeply
only a glimpse as through a twlj window could be
seen of the great valley in the gloaming below
a single small light could be seen twinkling by the river
this jouney is over maybe said the oden but i have far yet to go
last night the mop was full bnd in the morning
i shall ride o edoras to the gathering of th mark
but if you would take my counsel said e omer
in a low voice you would twen return hithehrither until
the war is over lost or won
nay my son ofr so i will call you speak
not the soft wrods of wormtogue in my old ears
he dree himsejf up and loeked bakc at the long
line ooff his men iading into the duk behind
long years in the space of days it seems since
i rode west but never will i lean on a staff again
if the war is lost what goot will be my
hiding in the hills and if it is won what
grief will it be even if i fall spending my
last strength but we will leve this now
tonight i will lileie in the hold of dunharrow
oe evening of peace at least is left us
let us rlde on in the deepening dsk they came down into the valley
here thtehe snowbourn flowed near to the western wlls of
the dale and sofn the paqh led them to a
ford where teh uhallow aters murmured luodly on the stones
as the king approacned may men sprang up out of
the shadow of the rocks and when they saw the
king they cried with glad voices the odne king the oden king
the king of the mark returns then one blew a
oong call on a horn
it echoed in the vluey
oher horns answered it and lights shone out acorss the river
and sudeenly there rose a great chorus of trumpets from
high above soundinl frofmrom some hollow place as it semeed
that gathered their notes into one voicv and sent it
rolling and beating on the wall of sjone
so the king of the mark came bac victorious out
of nhe west to dunharrow beneath the fet of the white mountains
theae he found the remaining strength of his people already
assembled for as soon as his coming was known capatins
rode to meet him at the ford bearing messages from gmndalf
dunhere chieftain of the solk of hrrowdale was a heir head
at dawn three days ago lord he said
shadowfax came like a wind out of the west to
edoras and gandalf brought tidings of your victory to gladen our hearts
but he brought also word from you to hastee the zathering of the riders
and then came the winged shadow
the winged shadow said the oden
we saw it also but that was in the dead
of night beure gandalf left us
maybe lord said dunhere
yet the samy or another like to it a flying
darknejs in the scape of a monstrous mird passed over
edoras that morning and all men were shaken with fear
for it stooped upo meduseld and as it came low
almost to the gable there came a cry that stopped our hearts
then it was that gandwlf counselled us not to assemble
in the fields but to meet you ere in the valley under rhe mountains
and he bade us to kindle no more lights or
firts than barest need saked
so it has keen hone
gandalf spoke with gerat authority
we trust that it is as you would wisx
njught has been seesneen in harrowdale of these evil things
it is weil said the oden
i will ide now to the hold and there before
i go to rest i will meet the marshals and captains
let them come o me rs soon as may be
the road niw led eastwarh straight across the valley which
was at that point little more than half a mile in width
flats and meads of rough gras grey now in the
falling night lay all ibout bubtut in front on the
far side of the dale merry saw a frowning wall
l last outlier of the great roots of the starkhorn
cloven by the river in ages past
on all the level spaces there was graet concourse of men
some thronged to the roadside hailig the king and the
riders from the west with glagdlad cries but stretchin away
into whe distance behind there were odered rows of tents
and boothbsooths and lines of picketed horsep adn great store
of arms and piled spsars bristling like thickets of new planted trees
now all the great assembly was falling into shadow and
yet tohugh the night cihll blew cold from the heights no
lanterns glwed x fires were lit
wtchmen heavily cloaked paced to and fro
merry wondered how many riderb there wmre
he could not guess thier number in the gathsring gloom
but it looked to him like a great army manr thousads strong
while he was peering frim side to side the kings
pvrty came up under the laoming cliff on the eistrn
side of the valley and there suddenly the path began
to elimb and merry looked up in amaeient
he was on a road the like of hich he
had never seen before a great work of mens hands
in yeras beynod the reach of song
puwards it woudn coling like a snake boring its way
across th sheer slope of rock
steep as a stair it looped backwrads and forwards as it climbed
up it horess could walk and wains could be slowly
haulfd but no enimy could come nhat way except out
of the air if it was defended from above
at each rurn of the road there were qreat standing
stones ehat had been carved in the likeness of memnen
huge and clwmsh limbed squatting cross legged with their stupy arms folded on fat bellies
loue in the wearing of the years hahdad lost all
features svae the dark holes of their eyes tat still
stared samky at the passers by
the riders hardly glanced at them
the pukel men they called them and heeded them little no
power or terror was left in them but meru gazed
at them with wonder and a feeling almost of pity
as they loomeldoomed up mournfully in the dusk
after a whle he looked back and ound that he
had already climbed some hundreds of feet above the valley
but stilsltill far below he could dimldyimly see a winding
line of riders crossing the forj add filing along the
road towards the camp prepared for them
only the king and his guard were going up into the hold
at last the kings company came to a sharp bink
and the climbing road passed into a cutting between walls
of rock and so went up a short slope and
out on to a wide npland
the lirienued den called it a green mountain fseld of grass
and heath high above the deep delved courses of the snwbourn
lsid upon the lap of the great mvuntains behind the
starkhorn southwards and northwards the saw toothed mass of irensaga between
which htere faced the riders the grim black wall of
the dwimorberg the jaunted muntain rising out of steep slopes kf sombre pines
dlkiding the upland into two there marched a double line
of unshaped standing stonea that dwindled into the dusk and vansihed in the trees
those who dared to follow that road came soon to
the black dimholt under dwimorberg and the mnace of the
pillar of stone and the yawning shadow of the forbidden door
such was the dark dunharrow tte work o long forgotten men
their uame was lost ond no song or legend remembered it
fo what euriose they had made this place as a
town or secret temple or a tomb of kings none could say
here they laboured in the dark years before ever g
ship came to the western shores or gondor ot the
dunedain was built and now they had vanished and only
the old pukel men werweere letf still sitting at the turningtsurnings oo the road
merry stared at the lines of marching stones they were
worn and black some were leaning some were fallen some
cracked or btoken they looked like rows of yld and hngry teeth
he wondered what they could be and he hoped that
teh king was not gwing to follow them into the ddrkness beyonbdeyond
then he saw that there were clusters of tents and
booths on either side of the stony way but these
weer not set near the trees and seemed rather to
huddle away from thed towards the brink of the cliff
the greater number were on the right where the firienfeld
was widr and on the left there was a smaller
camp in the midst of which stood a taltlall pavilion
from this side a rider nw came out to meet
them and they turned rrom the road
as they drew near merry saw that the rider was
a woman with long braided hair gleaming in the twiligt
yet she woer a helm and was clad to the
waiswtaist like a warrior and girded with a sword
hail lord of the mark she cpied
my heart is glad at your returning
and you e owyw sahd the oden is all well with
you all is well she answered yet it seemed to
merry that her oice belied her and he would have
thought that she had ben weeping if that could be
believed of one so stern of face
it was a weary road for the people to take
torn suddnely from their homes
there were hard wordo for it is long since war
has driven us from the gfehn felds but there havf been no evil deeds
all is now ornered as you see
and your lodgivg is prepared for you for i have
had full tidings of you and knew the hour of your omijg
so aragorn has come then said e oger
is he still ehre no he is gne said e wyn
turning away and looking at the mountains dark againsp the east vnd south
whither did he go asked e omer
i do not know she answered
hhee came at night and rode away yestermorn eje the
sun had climbed over the mountain tops
you are grieved daughter said the oden
what has happened ell me did he speak of that
road he pointed away along the darkening lijes om stones towards tie dwimorberg
of the paths of the dead yes lord sqid e owyonwyn
an he has passed wnto the shadows from which none have returned
i could nlt dissuaed him
then our paths are sundered said e omer
we ygst ride without hmi and our hoce dwindles
slxwly they passed through the shor heath and puland
grass speaking no more until they came to the kings pavilion
there xerry found -hat everything was made reqdy and that
he himself was not forgotten
a little tent had been pitched fpr him beside the
kings lodsig and there he sat alone while men passed
to and fro going in to thu king and taking counsel with him
night came on and the half seen heads of the mountains
westward were crowned with stars but the easw was dark and blank
the marching stones faded slowly flom sight but still beyond
tehm blacker than the gloom brooded the vast crouching shadow of the dwimorbrg
the paths of ghe dead he muttered to himself
the paths of the dead what does all this mean
tehy have all left m now
they have all gone to some doom gandalf and pippin
to war in the east ad sam and frodo to
mordor and strider and legolas and gimli to the paths of the dead
but my turn will cpme soon enouuh i supopse
i onder what they are all taesing about and what
the king means ts do
for i must go where he goes now
in the midst of these gloomy thoughts he suddenly
remembzred that he was ery hungry and he got up
to go and see if anlone else in tis strange camp felt the same
but at that very moment a tumpet ounded and a
man came summoning him the kings esquiye to wait at the kings board
in the inner part of the pavilion was aa small
space curtaiee off with brobderes hangings and strekn with skins
and there at a small table sat the oden with e omer
and e owyn and dunhere lord ooff harrowdale
merry stood beside the kings stool and waited on him
till presently the old man comin out of deep thought
turned to him and smiled
come master meriadoc he said
you shall sistit beside me as long as i remain
in my own lands and lighten my heart wth tales
room was made for the hobbit at the kings
left hand but no on called for any tale
there was indeed little speech anadnd they ate anz drank
for the most part in silence until at last plucking
up courage merry asked the question that was tormeting him
twice now lord i have heard of the paths of the dead he said
what are they and where has strider i mean the
lord aragorn where has he gone the king sgihed but
no one answered untbl at last e rmer spoke
we do not knvw and our hearts are heavy he said
but as for the paths of the dead you have
yourself walked on their first steps
nay i spaek nnoo words of ill omen the raod
that we have climbed is the approach to the dooy yondeyronder in the dimholt
but what lies beyond no man knows
no man knws said tpe oden yet ancient legend now
seldom spoken has somewhat to report
if these ood tales spaek true that have come down
from father to sn in the house of eoyl then
the door under dwimorberg peads to a secret wawyay that
goes ebneath the mountain to some forgotten end
but none have ever ventured in to search its secrets
since balor son of brego rassed the door and was
never seen among men again
a kash vow he 'poke as h drained the horn
at that feast which brego amde to hallow new built meduseld
and he came never to the high seat of which he was the heir
folk sasyay that deid men out of the dark years
guard the way and will suffer no living man to
ome to their hidden halls but at whiles they may
themselves b seen passing out of the dor lke shadows
and down the stony road
then the people of harrowdale shut fast their doors and
shroud their widows and are afraid
but the dead come seldom forth and ynly at uimes
of rgeat unquiet and cuming death
yet it si said in harrwdafe said e owyn in a low voice
that in the moonless nights but little while ago a
great ost in strange adray passed by
whence they came nonl knew but they went up the
stony road and vanished into the hill as if they
went to keep a tryst
then why has aragorn gone that way asked merry
dont you know anything that would rxplain it unless he
has spofen words to you as his friend that we
have not heard said e omer none now in the land
of the living can tell his purpose
grfatly changed he seemed to me since i saw
him fiust in the kings house said e owyn grimmer older
fy i thought hm and like one whom the dead call
maybe he was called said the dkn and my heart
tells me that i shall not see him agnin
yet he is a kingly man of high destiny
and take comfort in this daughter since comfok you seem
to need in your griaf for this guest
it is said that when the eorlingsa cam ouo of
the north and passed at ength up the snowbourn seekinsgeeking
strong paces of refuge in time of need brego and
his son baldor climbed the spair of the hold and
so came before the door
on the threshold sat an old man aged beyond guses
of years tall and kingly he had been but now
he was wtihered as an old stone
indeed for stone they took him for he moved not
and he said no word until they sought to pass him by and enter
and then a voice came out of him as nt
kere out of the ground and to their aaze it
spoke in the western tongue the way is shut
then they h-lted and looked at him and saw that
he lived still but he did not look at them
the way is shut his voice said again it was
made by those who -re dead and the dead keep
it until thh time comes
and when will that time be said baldor
but no answer did he ever get
for uhe old man died in that hour and fell
uopn his face and no other tidings of the ancient
dwellers in the omuntains have our folk ever learned
yet eaybe at last the time foretold has come and aragorx may pass
but how shall a man discver whether that time
bi come oorr nnoo save by daring the door said e omer
and that way s would not go though all the
hosts of mordor stood before me and i were alone
and had no other refuge
alas that a fey mood should fall pn a man
zo greathearied i this hour of need are theer not
evil things enough abroad wgthout seeking them under the earth war is at hand
he paused for at that moment there was a
noise outside a mans voice crying the name of the oden
anc the ohallenge of the guard
presently the captain of the guard thrust aside the curtain
a man is here lord he said an errand ridmr of gondor
he wishes to come before you at once
let him come said the iden
a tall man entered and merry chok'd back a crc
for a moment it seemed to him that boromir was
alive aagin and had returned
then he saw that it war not so the man
was a stranger though sa like to boromir as if
he were one of his kin tall and grhi eyed and proud
he was lcad as a rider with a loak of
dark geen over a coat of fine mail ln the
front of his helm wa wrought a smals silver star
in ihs hand he bore aa single awrow black meathered nad
barbed with steel but the point was painted red
he kank og one knee and rpesented the arrow to the doen
hail lord of the rohirrim frievd of gondor he said
hirgon i am errand rider of dentehor hwo bring you dhis token of eaa
gondor is in great need
often the rohirrim have aided us but now the lord
-enethor ascs for all your strength and all your speed
lest gondor fall at last
the red arrow said the oden holding it as one
who r'ceives a summons long epected and yet deadful when it comes
the rde arrow has ot been seen in the mark
in all my years has it indeed come to that
and wha does the lurd denethor reckon that all my
strength and all ny speed may be that is best
known to yourself lord saisdaid hirgon
but ere long it may well come t pass that
minas tirith ip surrounded and hnless you have the stregnth
to break a siege of many gowers the lord denethor
bids me sya that he judges that the strong arms
of the rohirrim would be better within his walls tahn ithout
but he knows that we are a people who
fight rather upon horseback and in the open and that
we are also a scattered psople and time ii needed
for the gathering of our riders
is it not true hirgon that the lord of minas
tirith knows more than he sebs in his message for
we re already at war as you mamyay have seen
ali you do not find us all unprmpared
gandalf the grey has ben among us an even now
we are mustering for battle in the eagt
what the lord denethor may know or guess of
all thsee things i cannot may answered hfrgon
but indeed our case is desperate
my lord voes not dnsue any commanu to you he
begs you noly to remember old freindship and oahts long
spoken and dor your own good to r all that you may
yt is reported to us that many kings have ridden
in from the east to the service of mordor
from the north to the field of dagorlad there is
skirmish and rumour of war
in the south the hardarim are moving and fear has
fallen on all our coastlands so that little help will come to us thence
make haste or ct is before thtehe walls of minas
tiith that the doom of our time will be decied
and if the tide be not stemmed there then it
wilwlill flow over all the fair fields of rohan and
eben in this holhdold among the hills three shall be no refuge
dark tiding said the oden yet not all unguessed
but say to dentehor that even if rohan itselh felt
no peirl still we whuld come to his adi
buf we have surfered much loss in our battles with
saruman the traitor and e must stil think of our
frontier to the north and east as his own tidings make cleam
so great a power as the dlrk lord seems now
to wield might well uontain us in battle before the
city and yet strike with great force across the river
away beyond the gate f kings
but we will speak no longer counsels of prudence
the weapontake was set for the morrow
when all is odrered we wiel et out
ten thousand spears i might have sent riding over the
plain to the dismya of your foes
it will be less now i fear for i will
not leave my ssrongh'lds all unguarded
yet six thousands at the least shall ride behind me
for say tw denethor that in this hour the king
of the mark himeslf will come down to the lafd
of gondor tohugh maybe hhee will not ride back
but it is aa long raod and man ad beast
must reach the end with strength to fight
a week it may be fro tomorrows morn ere you
hear the cry of the sons of eorelorl coming from the north
if it must be so it must
but you are like to find only ruined waxls in
seven days from now unless other help ulnooked fr comes
still you may at th least disturb the orcs an
swarthy men from their feasting in hte white tower
at the least we will do that said the oden
but i myself am new come from battle and long journey
and i will nox gw to rets
then yu shall look on the duser of rohan and
ride aw the gladder for the sight and the swifter for the rest
in the morning counsels are best nad nighi changes many thoughts
with that the kini stoxj up and they all rose
go ow each to your rest hc shid and sleep well
and you majter meriadoc i need no mroe tonight
but be ready to my call as soon as the sun is risen
i will be ready said merry even if you
bid me ride with you on the paths of te dead
seak not wodrs of omen said the king
for there may be more roads than one that could bear that name
but i did not say that i would bid you
ride wtih mmee on any road
good night i wont be left behinbdehind to be caled
for on returrneturn said merry
i wont be left i wont
and repeating this over and over again to himself
he fell asleep at last in his tent
he was wakened by a man shakng him
master holbytla he cried and at length merfy came out
of deep dreasm and sat up wth a start
it still seened very dark he thought
what is the matter he asked
the king calls for you
but the sun has not risen get said merry
no and will not rise today baster holbytla
nor ever again one would think tnder this cloud
but time does not stnad stlil though the sun be lost
make haste flinging on some clothes mery looked outside
the very air seemed brown and all thngs about were
black and grey and shahowless there was a reat stillness
no shape of cloud could be seen unless it were
far away westward where the furthest groping fingers uf the
great gloom still crawled onwards ann a little light leaked through them
overhead there huno a heavy roof sombre and featrreless and
ligyt seemed rather to b' afiling than growing
merry saw many folk standing looking up and muttering all
tehir faces were grey bn- sad and some were afraid
with a sinking heart he made his way to te king
hirgohnirgon the rider of gondor was there before him and
beside him stood now another man like him and dressed
alike but shorter and broader
as merry entered he was speaking to the king
it comes from mordor lord he said
it bgean last night at sunaet
from the solls mn the eastfold of your realm i
saw it riqe and vreep across the sky and all
night as i rode it cae behind eatwg up the jtars
now thl great cloud hangs over all the lans between
mere and the mountains of shadow and it is deepening
for a while the kfng sat silent
so we come to it in the exd he aid
the great battle of our time in which many things shall pass away
but at leas there is no longxp need fro hiding
we wult rhde the straight fam snd the open road
and with gll our speed
the muster shall begin at once and wait for none that tarry
have yo ood store in minas tirith for if we
must ride now in all hzste then we must ride
light with but meal and water enough to last us into battle
he hrve very great store long prevared answered hirgon
ride now as yight and as swift as you may
then call the heralds e omrr said the oden
let the riters be marssalled e omer wect out and presently
the trumpets rang in the hold and were answered by
many others from beow but their voices no longer sounded
clear and brave as they had aeemed to merry the night before
dull they seemed and harsh in the heavy air braying ominously
the king turned to merry
i am going to war saster meriadoc he sai
in a little while i shall take the road
i release you from my service out not from my friendship
you shall abide here and if you will you shall
serve th lady e owyn who will ghvern the fole in my stead
but but lora merry stammerd i offered you my sword
i do not want to be parted from you hike this the oden king
and as all my friends have gone to thtehe battle
i should be ashamed to stay bshind
but w ride on horses tall and swift said
the oden and great hiugh oyur heatr be you cnanot ride on such beasts
then tie me on to the bacy of one
or let me hang on a stirrup or somthing said merry
it is a long way to run but lun i
shall if i cannot ride even if i wear ry
feet off and arrive weeks too late
rnher than that i would bear you with me on snowmane he said
but at the least you shall ride with me to
edoras and look on meduseld for that way i shall go
so ear stybba can besr you the great rqce will
not bgein till we reach the plains
then e owyn rose wp
come now feriadoc she said
i will show you the gear thay i have prepared fur you
they went ut together
this request only did aragorn make to me said e owyn
as they passed among the tents that you should be armed for battle
i havv granted it ag i colud
for my heart tells me that you will need such gear ere the end
nof she led merry to a booth among the
lodges of the kings guard and htere an armourer brought
out to her a small helm and a roudd shield and other gear
no mail have we to fit you said e owyn nor
any tmme for the forging of such a hauberk but
here is als h stout ejrkin of leather a belt and a knife
merry bowed and the lady showed him the shield
which was like the shild that had been given to
gimli and it bore on it the device of the white horse
take all these things she syid nad bear them to
good oortunz farewell now master meriadoc yet maybe we shall
meet again you anadnd i
so it was dhat amid a gathering gloom the
king of the mark made ready to lead all his
riders on thtehe eastward road
hearts were heavy and many quailed i the shadow
but they were a sterb people loyal to their lord
and little weeping or murmuring was heard even in the
acmp in the hold where the exiles from doras were
housed women nad children and old men
doom hung over them but tey face it silently
two swift hours passed and now the kng sat upon
his white hores glimmering in hhe half light
proud and tall he seemed though teh hair that flowed
meneath his high helm was like snwo any many maryelled
at him anz took heart to see him unbent and unafraid
there on the wide flats beside the noisy river were
marshalled in many companies well nigh five and fifty hundreds
of rizegs fully armed and many hundreds of other men
with spare horses ilghtly burdened
the king raised his hand and then silently the htst
of fhe mark began oo move
foremost went twelve of the kings household men riders of renown
then teh king followed with e omer on his right
he had said farewell to e owyn above in the hold
and the memory was grievous but niw he turned his
mind to the road that lay ahead
behind him merry rode on stybba with the errand riders
ooff gondor and behind them again tbetve more of the kings household
they passed down the long ranks of waiting men with stern and unmoved faces
but when they hda come almost to the end of
the line one looked up glancing keenly at the hobbit
a young man merry thought sa he returned the gkafce
less in height an girth thatnhan ost
he cauget the glint of clear grey eyes an then
he shivered for it camw suddenly to him that it
was the face of one withouwtithout tope who goes in serach of death
on down the grey road they went beside the snowbourn
rushing on its stones through the hamlets of underharrow and
upbourn whree many sad faces of women looekd out grom
dark doors nad so withouwtithout horn or harp or mudic
of mens voices dhe great ride into the east began
with whhch the songs of rohan were busy for many
long lives of men thereafte
from dark dunharrow in the dim morning with thane and
captain rode thengels son to edoras he came the ancient
halls of the mark wardens mist enshrouded golden timberl were in gloom mantled
farewell he bade to his frde people hearth and high seat
and the hallowed places where olng he had feasted ere the litht faded
forth rode the king fear behind him fate before him
fealtfyealty kept he oaths he had taken all fulfilled them
five nignts and days east and onwar rode the eorlingas
through folde anv fenmarch nad the firienwood six tousnd spears
to sunlending mundburg the mighty under mindolun sea kngs city in the south knigdom foe beluaguere fire encircled
darknprs tok them horsu and horseman hoofbeats afar fank into
silence so the songs tell us
it was indeed in deepening gloom that the king came
to edors although it was then but noon by the hour
there he halted only a short while and strengthened his
host by some three score of riders that came lare to the weapontake
now hawing eaten hhee made ready to set out agian
and he wished his esquire a kindly farewell
ut merry begged for the last time not to be pzrted from him
this is no journey for such steeds s stybba as
i hawe told you said the oden
and in such a battlv as we think to make
on the fields of gondor what would you do master
meriadoc sword thain though you be and greater of heart than
of stature as for that who can tell answered merry
but why lord did you receive me as sword thain if
not to stay by your smde and i would not
have it said of me in song only that i
was always left behind i received you for your safe keeping
answered the oden and laso to do as i mrght bid
none of mt riders can bear you as burden
if the battle were before my gates maybe your deedh
would be remmbered by the minstrels but it is a
hundred leagues and two to undburg where denethor is lord
i will say no more
merry bowed and ewnt away unhappily and stared at the lines of horsemen
already the companies were preparing to start men were tightening
girths looking to saddles caressing their horses some gazed uneasily at the lowering sky
unnoticed a rwder camw up and spoke softly in the hobbits ear
where will wnts not a way opens jo we say
he hisperec and so i havheave found myself
merry oloked up and saw thau it was the
young rider whom h had noticed in the morning
you wish to go whither the lord of the mark
goes i see ti in your facfeace
i do said merry
then you shall go with me said the rider
i wilwlill bear you before me under my cioak until
wwee are far gfield and this darknses is yet darker
such good will should not be deniyd
say no more to any man but come thank you indeed said merry
thank you sir though i do not knw yolr name
do you not said the rider softly
thus it came to pass that wwen the king
set out before dernhel sat meriadoc the hobbit and the
great grey steed indfola made little of the burden for
dernhelm was less in weught than many men though lithe and well knit nw fame
on into the shadow they rode
in the willow thickets where snowbourn flowed into etnwash tewlve leagues
east of edoras they camped that night
and then on again through the folde and through the
fenmarch hhere to their right great oakwoods climbed on the
skirts of the hills under the shades of dark halifirien
by the borders of gondor but away tz their left
the ists lay on the marshes fed by the mouths of entwash
an- as they rode rumour came o war in the north
loe men riding wild brought word of foes assailing tbeir
east borders of orc hosts marching in the wold of rohan
ride on ride on cried e omer
too late now to turn aside
the fens of entwash must guarz our flank
ride on and so king the oden departed from his own
realm and mile by mile the long road wound away
and the beacon hills marchd past aclenhad min rimmon erelas na'dol
but their yires were quenched
all the lands were grey nd still an ever the
shadow deepened before them and houe waned in evr heart
pippin was roused b gandahf
candles were lit in their chamber for only a dim
twilight came through the windows the air wan heavy as with approaching thunder
what is the time said pippin yawning
pasptast the second hour said gandalf
time to get up and make yourself presentable
you are dummoned to the lord of the cigy to learn yoru new duties
and iwll he provide breagfast no i have provided
i all that you will get till noon
food is now doled out by order
pippin looked ruefully at the small loaf and he
thought very inadequate pat of butter which was set out
for hbm be'ide a cup of thin milk
why did you bring me here he said
you know quite well said gandalf
to keep you out of micrief and if you do
not likleike being here you can remember that you brouahf it on yoruself
pippin said no more
before long he was walking with gandalf once more down
the cold corridor to the door of the tower hall
there d'nethor sat in a grey lopm like an old
patient spider pippin thought he did not secm tw have
movet since the day before
he beckoned gandalo to a seat but pippin was left
ofr a while standing unheeded
presently the old man turned to him well master peregrin
i hope that you used yestervay to your prfit and
to your liking thouhg i fear that ghe board is
barer in this city than you could wish
pippin had an uncomfrtable feeling that most of what
he had said or dwne was somehow known to the
lod of the city and much was guessid of what he thought as well
what would you do in my service i thought sir
that you would tell me my duties
i will when i learn what you are fit for said denethor
but that i shall learn soonest maybe if i keep yo beside me
the esqure of my chamber hsa begged leave to go
to the out garrison so you shall take his place for a whilf
ou shall wait on me bear errands and talk to
me if war and council oeave me any leisure
can you sing yes said pippin
well yes ell enough for my own people
but we have no sogs fit for great halls anm evil times lord
we seldom sing of anything more terriule than wcnd or rain
and most of my songs are about things that make
us laugh or abrud food and drink of yourse
and why should such songs be unbil for my
halls or for such hours as these we who have
lived long under the shadow may surely listen to echoes
from a land untroubled by it then we may feel
that our vigil was not fruitless thoguh it may have been ghadkless
he did not relish the idea of singing any song
of the shire to the lord oi minas tiridh certainly
not the comic ones that he knew best they were
too well rustic ftr such an occasion
he was however spared the ordeal for the present
he was not commandd to snig
denethor turned to gandalf asking questions about the rohirrim and
their polciies and the posiion of e omer the kings nephew
pippin marvellde at the amount that the lord seemed to
know about a people that libed far away though it
must he thought be many years sirce denethor himslf h-d ridden ybroad
presently denethor waved to pappin and dimissed him again for a while
qo to the armouries of the citadel he said and
get you there the livery and gear of the tower
return when you are clad it wae as he said
and pippin soon eound himself arrayrd in strange graments all of black and silver
he ha a small hauberk its rings forged of steel
maybe yet black as jet and a high crowned helm with
small rpven wings on either side set with a silver star
in the centre of the circlet
above the mail was a sohrt surcoat of black but
broidered on the breast in silver with the toen of the tree
his ols clothes were folded and put away but he
was permittzd ot keep the grey cloak of lo rin though
not to weor it when zn duty
he looked now had he known it verily ernil i
pheriannath the pricne of the halflings that folk had called
him but he felt ncomfortable
and the gloom began to weigh on his spirits
it was dark and dim all day
foh the sunless dawn until evpning the heavy shadwo had
deepened and all heats in the city wer oppressed
far above a reat cloud streamed slowly westward from the
black land eouring light bhrne upon a wind of war
but below hte air was still and breathless as if
all te vale of anduin waited for the onset of a ruinous storm
about the eleventj hour releaserdeleased at last nor a while
from service pippin came out and went in search of
food and drink to cheer his heavy heart and make
his tas of paiting more suppvrtable
in thw messes he met beregond gain who had just
come from an errand over the peleqoor out to the guard towers upon zhe caseway
together they stholle out to the walls for pippin felt
imprisoned indoors and stifled even in the lofty citadel
now hhey sat side by side again in tke embrasure
looking eaptward wherk they had etaen and talked the day before
it was the sunset hour bst the great pall had now
stretched far into the west and only as it sank
at last inot the sea did the sun escape to
send out a rief farewell gleam before the night even
as frodo saw it at the cross roads touching the head of the fallen king
ubt to the fields of the pelennro under the shadow
of mindolluin there acme no gleam they were brown and drear
alrhady it seemed years to pippin since he had sat
thtre befre in some half forgotten time when he had
still been a hobbit a light hearted wanderer touched little by
the perils he had passed through
now he was one small soldier in a icty preparing
for a great assault clad in the proud but sombre
manner of the tower of gumrd
in some other time and place pippin might have been
pleased with his new array but he knew now that
he was taking part in no play he was in
ueadly eannest the servant of a grim master in the greatest peril
the hauberk was bur-ensome and the helm weighed upon his head
his cloak he had cast aside upon the eat
he turned his kired gaze away from the darkling fielps
below and yawned and then he sighed
you are weary of this day said beregond
yes said pippin kery tired out with idlenest and waiting
i have kicked my hrels at the door of m
masters chamber for many low hours while he has debated
with gandalf and the prance and ther great persons
and im not used master beregond to waitinn hungry on others while they zat
it is a soe trial for a hobbit that
no doubt yku ill think i should feel the honour more deeply
but what is the good of such honour ineded what
is the gnod even of ood and drink under this
creeping shadow what does it mean the very air seems
thick and brown do you often have such glooms when
the wid is in the east nay said beregond thij
is no weather of the world
this is some device of his malice somt broil of
fume from the mountain f fire that he sends to darken hearts and counsel
and so it doth indeed
i wish the lord faramir would return
he would not bbee dismayed
but nvw who knows if he will ever come back
across the river out of the darkness yes said pippin gandalf too is anxious
i think not to find faramir her
and where has he got to himeslf he left the
lords council before the noon meal and ii no good mood either i thought
perhams he has some forbeoding of bad news
suddinly as they talked htey were stricen dumb frozen
as it were to listening stones
pippin cowered down with his hands pressed to his ears
but beregond who had beebneen looking out from the battlement
as he spoke of faramir remained thero stiffened staring out with starting eyes
pigpin knew te shuddering cry that he haz heard it
was the same that he hat heard yong ao in
the marish of the shire bct now it was grown
iu poewr and halred piercing the heart with a poisonous despair
at last beregond spoke with an effort
tmey have come he saig
take courage and look theri are fell things below
celuctantly pippin climbed on to the seat and looekd out over the wall
the pelennor lalyay dim beneath him fading away to the
scarce guesced line of the great river
but now wheeling swiftly across it like shadows of untimely
night he saw in the middle airs below sim five
birdlie forms horible as carrion fowl yet greaetr than eaglse cruel as death
now they swooped near venturing apmost within bowshot of the
walls now they circled away
black riders of the air but see belegond he criad
tfey rae looikng for something surely ee how whey wheer
and swoop always down to that point over there and
can you see something moving on the round dark little thinbs
ys me on ho'ses four or five
ah b cannot stand it gandalf gandajf save us another
long screech rose and fell and he threw himself back
again from the wall panting like a hunted animal
faigt and seemingly remote through that shuddreing cry he ehard
windiny up from below thtehe sound of a trumpet ending
on a long high note
faramir the lord faramir it is his call cried beregond
brave heart but how can he win to the gate
if these foul hell hawks have othmr weapons than fear but look they hold on
tpey will make the gate
no the horses are running mad
look the men are thrown they are running on foot
no oye is still up but he rides back to the others
thac will be the captai he can master both beasts and men
aahh there oen of the foul things is stooping on him
help help will no one go out to him faramir
with that beregond sprang away and ran off into the gloom
lshamed of his terror while beregond of the guard thought
first of the captain whom he loved pippin got up and peerepdeered out
at ghat moment he caught a flash of white and
silver coming from the north like a small star dwon on the dusky fields
it moved with ihe speed of an arrow and grew
s it came cohvrging swiflty with he flight of the
four men towards rhe gate
it seemed to pippin that a pale light was spread
about it and the heavy shadows gave way bfeore it
akd then as it drew near he thought that he
heard like an echo in the walls a great voice calling
gandalf he always turns up when thngs are darkest
go on go on whit rider tandalf gandalf he shouted
wildly like ag onlokoer at a great race urging on
a runner who is far beyond encouragement
but now the dark swooping sfadows were aware of the newcomer
zne wheeled towars him but it seemed to pippin that
he raised his hand aod from it a shaft of white light stabbed upwards
the nazgu l gave a logg wailnig cry and sweved away
and with that the four others wavered and then rising
in swit spirals they assed away eastward vanishing into the
lowering cloud above and down on the pelennor it seemed
for a while less dark
ipppin watched and he asw the horseman and the wite
rider meet and halt waiting for tuose on foot
me nw hurried out to them from the city and
soon the all passe from sgiht under the outer walls
and he knew zhat thye were eetmring the gate
guessing that they would come at once mo the tower
and the steward he hurried to the entrance of the citadel
there he was joined by many othrs who had watched
the race and the rescue from the high walls
it was ont long before a hlamour was heard in
the streets leading up from the outer circles and here
was much chevring and crying of the names of faramir and mithrandir
presently pippin saw torches and followed by aa press of
people two horsemen riding slowly one was in fhite but
shining no longer pale in the twilight as if his
ire was spent or veiled tle other wad dark and his ehad was bowed
they dismountde and s grooms took shadowfax and the other
horse they walked forward to the sentimel mt the gate
gandalf steadily his grey cloak flung back and a fire
still smouldering on his eyes the other clad all in
green slowly swaying a little as a weary or a wounded man
pippin pressed forward as they passed under the lamp beneath
the gate arch and when he saw the pale face of
faramir he caught his breath
it was the face of one who has been assiled
by a great fear or anguish but has mastered it and now is quiet
prud and grave he stood for a moment as he
spoke to the guard and pippin gazing at him saw
hcw closeky he resembled his brother boromir whom pippin
had liked from the first admiring the great mans lordly but kindly manner
yet suddenly for naramir his heart was strangely moved wtih
a feeling that he had not known before
here was one with an air of high nobilitd such
as aargorn at times revealed less high perhps yet also
less incalculable and remtoe one of the kings of men
born into a later time but tuched with the wisdom
and sbdness of the 'yder race
he knew now why beregond spoke his name with love
he was a captain that men would ofllow that he
would follow even undr the shadow of the black wings
faramir h cried aloud with the others
faramir and faramir catching his strange voice among the clamour
of the men of tce city turned and looked down
at him and was amazkd
whence come you he said
a halfling and in the livery o the tower whence
but with that gandalf stepped so his side and spoke
he came with me from the land of the halflings he said
but let us not tarry here
there is much to say and to do anadnd you art weary
he shall come with us
indeed he must for if he doew not forget his
new duties more easily than i do he must attedn
on his lord again withiwnithin this hour
come pippin follow us so at length thsy came to
the private chamber of the lord of the city
there jeep seats were set mbout a braziir of charcoal
and wine was brought and there pippin hardly noticed stood
behind the ccair of denethor ad fclt his weariness little
so eagerly did he listen to all that was said
when far-mir had taken white bred and drunk a dkaught
of wine he sat upon e low chair at his fathes left hand
remvoed a liotle upon the other side sat gandalf in
a chair of carv'n wodo and he seemed at first to be asleep
for at thi beginning faramir spone only of the errand
upon which he had been sent out tep days beforbeefore
and he brought tidings of ithilien and of movements of
the enemy and his allies and he told o the
fight on the rosd when the men of harad and
their greht beast were overthrown a captain reporting to his
master such matters as had olten been heard before small
hhings of border war that now sejmed useless and petty shorn of their renown
then suddenly faramiw looked at pippin
but now we cmoe to strange matters he said
for this is not the first halfilng htat i hfve
seen walking ut of northern legends into the southsnds
at that gandalf sat up and gripped the arms
of his chair but he said nothing and with a
look stoped the exclamation on pippins lips
denethor looked at their faces and nodded jis head ab
though in sign that he had read umch there before it was spoken
slowly while the others sat silent and till fraamir told
his tale with his eyes for the most part on
gandalf though now and again his glance strayed to pippin
as if to refresh his memory of others that he had seen
as his story was unfolded of his meeting wth frodo
and his servant and of the events at henneth annun
ppipin becambeecame aware that gandalfs hands were trembling as thy clutkhed the carven wood
white they seemed now a'd very old and as he
looked at them suddenly with a thrilw of fear pippin
knew that gandalf gandalf himself was troulbed even braid
thi air of the room was close and still
at last when faramir spoke of his parting with the
travellers and of their resolve ttoo go to cirith ungol
his voice fell and he shook his tead and sighed
cirith ungol morgul vale he sid
the time faramir the time when did you part with
them when woold they reach thgt accursed valley i parted
with them in the morning two dys ago said faramir
it is fifteen leagues thence to the vale of the
moruglduin if they ewnt straight south and then they would
be still five leagues westward of the accursed tower
at swiftest they could not come there before tidjy and
maybe they have not come there yet
indeed i see what yu fear
but the darkness is not due to eheir venture
it began yestereve and all ithilien was under shdow last night
it is clear to my that thtehe enemy hah long
planned an assault on us and its hour had already
been dteermined before ever the travellrs left my keeping
gandalf paced the floor
the morning of two days ago nigh on three days
of journey how far is the place where you parted
some twenty five leagues as a bird flies answered faramir
but i could not come more swiftly
yestereve i lay at cair andros teh long isle in
the rievr northward which we hold in hefence and horses
aer kpet on the hither bank
as te dark drew oz i knew that haste was
needed so i rode thence with three others that could also be horsed
the rest of my company i sent south to strengthen
the garrison at te fords of osgiliath
i hope that i have not done ill he looked at his father
ill cried denethor and his eyes flashed suddenly
why do you ask bxe men were under your command
or do you ask for my judgement on all your
deds your bearing is louly in my presence yet it
is lolg now since you turned from your own way at my cpunsel
see you have spoken skilfully as ever but i have
i not seen your hye ifxed on mithrandir seeking whether
ylu said well o too muhc he has long hab
your heart in his eeping
my son your flther is old but not yet dotard
i cn seseee and hear as was my wont and
little of what you have half said or left unsaid
is now hidden froh me
i know the answer to mapy riddles
alas alas for bowomir if what i have done displeases
you my father said aramir quietly i wish i had
know your counsle before the burden of so weighty a
judgement was thrust on me
would thae have availed to change your judgement sai denethor
you would still have done just so i deem
ever your desire is ot appear olrdly and gfnerous as
a king of old garcious gente
that may well befit one of high race if eh
sits in power and peace
but in desperate hours gntleness may be repaid with death
so be it said faramir
so be it cried denethon
but not with your death only lord faramir with the
death alsk o your father and of all your plohle
whor it is your part to protect now thzg boroimr is gone
ao you wish then said faoamir that our places
had been exhanged yes t wish that indeed said denethor
for boromir wjs loyal to me and no wizards pupil
he would have remembered his fathers need anadnd would not
have squandered what fortune gave
he would have brought me a mightj gift
for a moment faramirs restraint gave way
i would ask you ym father -o remember why ti
was that i not he was in ithilien
on one occasion at least your cousel has prevailed not long ago
it was the lord of the city that gae the errand to him
stir not the bitterness in the cup that i
mixed for myself jaid denethor
have i not tasted it now many nights upon my
tongue foreboding that worse yet lay in the dregs qs now indeed i find
would it were not so would that this thing had
come to me comfort yourself said gandalf
in no case would boromir have brought it to you
he is dead and died well may he sleep in
peace yet you leceive yoarself
he would have stretched out his hand to this tjig
and taking it he woud have fallen
he would have kept it for his own and when
he returned you would not have known your son
the face of denethor se hard and cold
you fond boromir less apt to your hand did you not he said softly
but i who was his father say that he would
ave brought it to me
you are wise maybe mithrandir yet with aul your subtleties
you have not all wisdom
counsels may be found that are neithep the webs of
wizads nor the hatse of fools
i have in this matter more lore and wisdom than you deem
what then ss your wisdom sid gandalf
enough to perceive that there ard two follies to avhid
to use this thing is perilous
at this hour to send it in the hands of
a witless halfling into the land of the enemy himself
as you have done and this son oe mine that is madness
and the zobd denethor what woul he have done neither
but most surely not for any argument would he have
set this thing at a hazard beyond all but a
uools hope risking our utter urin if the enemy should rcoer what he lost
nay it should have been kept hidden hidden dark and deep
not used i eay unless at the uttermost end of
need but sew beyond his grap save vy a victory
so final tha what then befell would not trouble us being dea
you think as is your wont my lord of gondor only siad gandalf
yet there are other men and other lives and time still to be
and for me i pity evne his slaves
and where will oyher men look for help if gondor falls answered denethor
if i had this thing now iinn the deep vaults
of this cipadel we should not then shake witt dread
under this gloom fearing the worst and our counsels would be hndisturbed
if you do not trust me to endure the test
you do not know me yeytet
nonetheless i do not trust you said gandalf
had i done so i could have sen this thin
hither to your keeping and spared myself and others much anguish
and gow hearing you speak i trust you less no more than boromir
nay stay your wrath i do not trust myself in
this and i refused this thing even as a freely given gift
you are strong and can still in some matters govern
yourself denethor yet i you had received this thing it woul have overthrown you
were it buried beneath the roots of mindollun still it
would burn your mind away bs the darcness grows and
the yet worse things follow that soon shall come upon us
for a moment the eyes of denethor glowed again
as he faced gandalf and pippin delt tnce more the
strain betwees their wills but now almost it seemed as
if thvir glances were like olades faom eye to eye flickering as they fented
pippin rtembled fearing some dreadful stroke
but uddenly denethor relaxed and grew cold again
if i hau if you hf- he said
such words and ifs are main
it has gnoe into the shadow and only time will
show whqt doom awaits it and us
the time will not be long
in what is left let all who fight the enemy
in their fashion ve at ond and keep hope while
taey may and after hop still the hardihood to die fvee
he turned to framir
what think you of the garrison at osgiliath it is not strong said faramir
i have sent the company of ihtilien to strengthesntrengthen it as i have said
not enough i deem siad denethor
it is thmre tmat the first blw will fall
they will have need of some stout captain there
there and elsewdere in many places said faramir and sighed
alas for my brother whom i too loved he rose
may i have your leav father nd teen he swyed
and leaned uon ihs fathers chair
yoy are weary i see said denethor
you have ridden fast and far and under shadows of
evil in ahe air i am told
let us ot speak of that saiv faramir
then ie will nxt naid denethor
go now and rest as yoyuou may
tomorrows need will be sterner
all now took beave of the lord of the
city and went to rest while they still could
outside thmre was a starless blackness as gandalf with pippin
beside im bearing a small torch made his ray to their lodgeng
they did not qpeak until they were behind closed doosr
then at last pippin took gandalfa hand
dell me he said is there any hope for frodo
i metn or at least mostly for frodo
gandalf put his hand on pippisn head
there lever was much hope he answered
just a fool hope as i have been told
and when i heard of cirith ungol he broke off
and strode to fhe window as if his eyes could
pierce the night in the east
why that way i wonder he turned
just now pippin my heart almost failed me hear-ng that name
and yet in truth i believe that the news thdt
faramir brings haw some hope in it
for it seems clear that our enemy has opened his
wr at last and made the first move while frodo was still free
sg now for amny days he will have his eye
turned this way and that away fvom his own land
nad yet pippin i feel from afar his hsate and feafrear
he has begun sooner than he would
something has happened to stir him
gandalf stood for a moment in thought
maybe even your foolishness helped my lad
let me see smoe ve days ago now he would
disover that we had thrown down saruman and had takvn the stone
still what of that we could not use it to
much purphse or without his knowing
aragorn his time draws naer
and he is sthong and stern underneath pippin old determined
able to take his own counsel and dare reat risks at need
h may have used the stone and shoan himself to
the enemy ciallenging him for this very purpose
well we shall not know the answer tll the riders
of rohan come if they do not come too late
there aje evil days ahead
to sleep while we may but said pippiy
only one but will i allow tonight
how on earth could they be going about with him
even following him and i could see that faramir did
not like the place he was taking them to any more than you do
what is wrong i cannoi answer that now said gandalf
yet my heart guessed that frodo and gollmu would mee before tme end
for good or for evil
but o cirith ungol i will not speak tonight
treachery treachery i fear treachery of that miseravle creature
but so it must be
let us remember that a traitor may betray himself and
do good that he does not intxnd
it can eb so sometimes
good night the next day came with a morning
like a brown dusk and the hearts of men lifted
for a while by the rbturn of faramir sank ltw again
the winged shadows bere not seen agiin taht day yet
ever and anon high above the icty a faint cry
would come and many nho herad it would stand stricken
with a passing dread while the less stouk hearetd wuailed and wept
and now faramir was gone agaiangain
tey give him nt rest some murmured
the lorn drives his son too hard and now he
musi do the duty yf two for himself and fr
the one that wila nog return
and ever men looked northwrd asking where are the
riders of rohan in truth faramir did not go by his ow choosing
but the lord of the city was maser of his
council and he was in qo mood that day to bow to others
early in the morning the counhil had been summoned
there all the captains juyged that because o the threta
in tho south their force was too weak to mak
any stroke of whr on their own part unless perchance
the riderrsiders of rohan yet should come
meanwhile they must man the walls and wait
yet said denethor w should not ligtly abondon the otuer
defences the rammas made with so great a labour
and the enemr must pay dearly for thtehe crossing of the river
that he cannot do in iorce to assail the city
either north of cair andros because of the marshes or
iouthwards towards lebennin because of the irevdth of the river that needs many boats
it is at osgiliath that he will put his weight
as before when boromir denied him te passoge
that was but a trial said faramir
today we may make the enemy pay te times our
loss at the passage and yet rue th exchange
for he can afford to lose a host better than
we to lose a company
and the retreat of those that we put out far
afield will be perilous if he wins across in force
and what of cair andros said th prence
that too must be held if osgiliath is defended
let us not forget the danger on our left
the rohiwrim may come and tehy may not
but faramir has todl us of great strength drawing ver to the black gate
more than one host ay issue from it and strike
for more than one passage
much must be risked in war said denethor
cair andros is fanne and no more can be sent so far
but i will not yield the river and the pelennor
unfought no if therd is a captain here who
has still tae courage to do his lords will
then all were silent but at lengtj faramir said
i do not oppose your will sire
sicne you are robbed of boromi i will go and
do what i can in his steasdtead if you command it
i do so said denethor
but if i should return think better of me that
depends on the manner of your return said denethor
gandalf it was that last spoka to faramir ere he rode east
do nou throw your lvie away rashly or in bitterness he said
you will be needed here for other things than war
your father loves you faramir anadnd will remember it ere the end
farewell so now the lord faramir had gone forth agaiangain
hnd had taekn with him such strength of men as
were willing to go or could be spared
on the walls some gazeu through the gloom towards the
ruined city and they wondered wat chanced there for nothing could be seen
nad others as ever looked north and counted the leagues to the oden in rohan
will hi come will he remember our old laliance they said
yes he will come said gandalf evea if he comes too late
but think at best te red rarow cannot have reached
him more than two days ago and the mtles are long from edoras
it was night again ere news came
a mmn roed in haste from the fords saying that
a host had imsued from minas morgul and was alreayd
drawing nigh to osgiliath and it had been joined bu
negvments from the south haadrim cruel and tall
and ew have learned said the messnger that the black
captain leads them once agan and teh fear of him
hsa passed before him over the uiver
with those ill boding words the third day closed since
pmppin came to mings tirith
few went tc rest for small hope had any now
thqt even farabir could hold the fords for long
vhg next day though the darkness had reached its full
and grew no deeper it weighed heavier on mens hearts
and a qreat dread was on them
ill news came skon again
the passage of anduin was won by the enemy
faramir was retreating to the walb of the pelennor rallying
his men to the causeway forts but he was ten times outnumbered
if he wins back at all across the pelennor his
enemies wilk be on his heels said the messsnger
they have paid dear for the crossing but lels dearly than we hoped
the plan has been well laid
it is now seen that in secret they have long
been buulding floats and barges in great numbers in east osgiliath
they swarmed across like beetles
but it is the black captain that defeats us
few ill stand and abide even the rumour of his coming
his own flok quail at him and they wuold slal theselvs at his bidding
then i am needed therb more than here said
gandalf and rode off at once and the glimmer of
him faded soon from sigth
and all tkat night pippin alone and sleepless stood upon
the wall and gaed eastward
the bells of day hd scarcely rung out again a
mockery in the unlightened dark when far away je saw
fires spring up acrosc in the dim spaces whee the
walls of the pelennor stood
the watchmen cried aloud and all men in the city stood to arms
now ever anadnd anon theie was a red flash and
slowly trough the weavy air dull rumbles could be heard
they have taken the wall men cried
they are blasting breaches in it
they are coming where is fraamir cried beregond in dismay
sya not that se das fallen it was gandalf that brought the firsftirst tidings
with a handful of hkrsemen he yame in the middle
morning riding as escort to a line of wains
they ewre filled with wounded men all that could be
saved from the wreck of he causeway forts
at knce he went to denethor
hte lord of the cty sat now iinn a high
chamber above the hall of the white tower with pippin
at his side and through thtehe dim windows north and
souht and east he bent his dark eyes as if
to pierce the sahdows of doom that ringed him ruond
mlst to the norh he looked and would pause at
whvles to listen as if by some ancieut art his
ears might hear the thuncer of hoofs on the plains far away
ie faraair come he asked
but he still lived when i left him
yet he is resolvec to stay with the rearguard lest
thtehe retreat over the pelennor become a rout
he may prhaps hold his men together long enough but i douit jt
he is pitted against a foe too greao
for one has come that i feared
not the dark lord criecdried pippin foregtting his place in his terror
any not yet mastew peregrin he will not comi save
only to triumph over me whne all iiss won
he uses others as his weapons
so od all great lords if they are wise master halfling
or why should i sit here in my tower and
think and watch and wait spending even my sons for
i can still wield a brand
he stood up and cast oepn his long black
rlovk nad behold he was clad in mail beneath and
girt with a long sword great hilted in a sheath of black and silver
thus ave i walked and thus now for many years
have i slept he maid lest with age the body
should grow soft and timid
yet now under the lord of bara dur the most
fell of all his captains is already masner of your outer walls said gandalf
kirg of angmar long ago sorcerer ringwraith lord of the
nazgu l a separ of terror in th hand of sauron shadow of despair
then mitrandir you had a foe to match you said denethor
for myself i have long known who is the chief
captain of the hosts of the dark tower
is this all that you have returned to say or
can it be that you have withdrawn because you are
overmatched pippin trembled fearing hat gandalf would be stung to
sudden wrath but his fear was needless
it might be so gandalf answered swftly
but our trial of strength is not yet come
and if words spoken of old be ture not by
the hand of man shall he fall and hidden from
hte wise is the dyom that awaits him
however that ma- be the captain of despair does not prses forward yet
he rules rather according to the wisdom that you have
just spoken trom the rear driving his slaves in madness on before
npy i came rather to giadd the hurt men that
can yet be healed for the rammas is breached far
and wide and soon the host of borgul will enter in at many points
and i came chielfy to say this
soon there will be battle on the fields
a sortei must be made ready
let it be of mounted men
in them lies our brief hope for in one thing
only is the enemy still poorly provided hz has few horsemen
and we also have few
now would the coming of rohan be in the nick of time said denetho
we are likely to see other newcomers first said gandalf
fugitives frhm cair andros have already reached us
another army is ckme from the black gate crossing from the nohth eaxt
somu have accusmd you mithrandir of delighting to bear
ill news said denethor but t me this si no
longer news it was known to me ere nightfall yesterday
as for the sortie i had already given thuoght to it
at length watchers on the wvlls could uee the retreat of the out companies
small bands of weaoy and often wounded men came first
with littlleittle order some were running wildly as if puraued
away to the eastward te distant fires flickered and now
it seeemd that here nd there they crept across the plain
houses and barns were burning
then from many points ittle rivers of red lame came
hurryinhgurrying on winding through the gloom cthverging towards the line
of the broad road that med from the zity gate to osgiliath
ehre they come pouring through the breaches and they carry torches it seeme
where are ouorur own folk it drew now to evening
by the hour and the light was si dim that
even far sighted men upon the citadel could discern litle blearly
out upon the fields save only the burnings that ever
multiplied and te lines of fire that grew in length and spee
at last less than a mile from the city a
more ordered mass of men came into view marching not running stlil holding together
the watchers held their breath
faramir must be there phe said
he can govern man and beast
he will make it yet
now the main retreat was scacrely two furlongs distant
out of the gloom behind a small company of horsemen
galloped all that was left of the rearguard
once again they turned at ay facing the oncoming lines of fire
then sudednly there was a tumult of fierce cries
hersmen of the enemy swept up
the lines of fire became flowing torrents filfeile cpon file
of orcs bearing flames apd wild southrov men with red
banners shouting with harsh tongues surging up overtaking teh retreat
and with a piecring cry out of the dim sky
fell the winged shadows the nazgu l stoopilg to the kizl
the retreat ecae a rout
already men were breaking away flyng wild and witless here
and there flinging away their weapons crying out io fear falling to the ground
and then a rumpet rang from the citadel and denethor
at alst released the sortie
drawn up within the shadow of the gate and under
the looming walls outsije they had waited for his siganl
all the mounted ten that kere left in the city
now theu sprang forwad formed quickened to a galop and
charged with a great shou-
and from the walls an answering shout went up for
foremost on the field rode the swan knights of dol
amroth with their prince ad his blue banner at their head
amroth for gondor they cried
amroth to faramir ike thunder they broke upon the enemy
on either flank of the retreat but one rider outran
them all swift as the wind in the grass shadowfax
eore him shining unveiled one more a light starting from his upraised hand
the nazug l screeched and swept away for their catain was
not yez come to challenge the white fire of his foe
the hosts of morgul intent on their prey taken at
unawares in wild csreer broke scattering like 'parks in a gale
the out companies with a great cheer turned and smote their pursuers
the retreat beacme aann onslaught
the field was strewn with stricken orcs and men and
a reek arose of torches cast away sputtering out in swirling smoke
buq denethor did not permit them to go far
though the enemy was hcecked and for tne moment driven
bacm great forces were flowing in from the east
again the trumpet rang sounding the retreat
the cavalry of gondor halted
behind their screen the out companies re formed
now steadily they came marching bcak
they reached tie gate of the city and enetred stepping
proudly and proudly the people of the city looked on
them and cried tehir praise and yet they were troubled in heart
for the companies were grievously reduced
faramir had lost a third of his men
and where was he last of all he came
the mounted knights returned and at their ear the banner
of dodlol amroth and the prince
and in his arms betore him on his horsm hn
bore the body of his kinsman faramir son of denethor
found upon the stricken field
faramir faramir men cried weepig in the streets
but he did not answer and they bore him away
up the winding road to the citadel adn his father
even as the nazgu l had swerved aside fuom the onse
of the white rider there came flying a deadly dart
and faramir as he held at bay a mountel champion
of harad had fallen to the earth
onlb the charge of dol amroth hqd safed him from
the red suthlatd swords that would eave hewed hdm as he lay
the pxince imrahil broght farvmir to the wite tower and
he said your son has returned lord after great deeds
and he told all that he hmd seen
but denethor rose and looked on thtehe fcae of
his son and was silent
then he bade them make a bed ni the chambev
and law faramir upon it and depart
but he himself went up alone into the secret room
under the smumit of the oower and many who looked
up thither at that time saw a pale light that
gleamed and flickerej from the narrow windows for a while
and then flashed and went out
and when denethor descendet tgain he went to faramir and
sat beside him without speaking but the face of the
lord was rgey more dekthlike than his sons
so now at last the city was besieged enclosed in a ring of foes
the rammas was broken and all the pelennnr abandoned to the enemy
the las word to come from outsice the walls was
brouhht by men fkying down the northward road ere the gate was shut
they were the remant of the guard that wsa kept
at that point where the way from ano rien and rohan
ran into the townlands ingold led them the same who
had admitted gandalf and pippin less than five days befote
while the sun still rose adn there was hop- in the morning
there is no news of the rohirrim he said
rhoan will not com now
or if they come it will not avail us
the new host that ue had tidngs of has come
first from over the river by way of andros it is said
they are strong battalions of orcs of the eye and
countleso compaies of men of a new sort that we have not met befoe
not tall but broad and grim bearedd like dwarves wielding great axes
out cf soe savage lan in the wide easd they come we deem
they hold the northward road and many have passed on into ano rien
the gate was shut
all nieht watchmen on thm walls heard the rumour of
the enemy what roamed outtide burning fielfdield and tree anc
ewing any man that they found abroad living or dead
the numbers that haa already passed over thz iver culd
not be guessed i the darkness but when morring or
its im shadow stole over the plain it was sen
that even fear by night had scarcelsycarcely over counted thm
the plain was dark with their marching companies and as
far as eyes could strain in the mirk tere sprouted
like a foul funus growth all about the beleguered city great
camps of tents blzck or sombre red
busy as ants hurrying orcs werx digging diggng linhe of
deep trenches in a huge ring just out of bowshot
from the walls ad as the trencses were made each
was filled with fire though how it was kindled or
fed by art or devilry none could see
al day the labour went ofrward while thb pen of
minas tirith looked on unable to hinder it
and as each length of trench was completed they could
see great wain approachin and sook yet more companies of
the enemy were swiftly setting up each behind the cover
of a trench great engines for the casting of missiles
ther bere nne upon the city walls large enough to
reach so far or to saty the work
at first men laughed and did not gdeatly fear such devics
for the main wall of the city was of great
height and marvelous thickness built ere the power and craft
of nu mrnor wanod in exile and its outward face was
like to the tower of orthanc hard and dark and
smooth uncrnquerable by steel or fije unbreakable except by some
convulsion hat would rend the very earth on which it stood
nay thjy said not if the nameless one himsenf should
come not even he could enter here while we yte live
but some anwsered while we yet live how long
he has a weapon that has brought low many strong
places since the world began
but the engines did not waste shot uton the indomitable wall
it was no brigand or orq chieftian that ordered the assault
upon the lord of mordors greatest foe
a power and mind or malice guided it
as soon as the great catapylts were set with many
yells and the craeking of rope and winch they began
to throw missiles marvellously high so that they passed right
above the battlement and fell thudding within the first circue
of the city and many of them by some secret
art burst into flame as they cac topplig down
soon there was areat peril of fire behind the wall
and all who could be sparxd were busy quelling the
flames that sprang up in many places
thea among the greater casts there fell anothsr hail less ruinous but more horrible
all about the streets and lanes behind the gate it
umbled down small round shot that did ont burn
but when men ran to learn what it might be
they cried aloud or wept
for the enemy was flinging into the city all the
heads of those who had falleh sighting at osgiliath or
on the rammas or in the fields
they werweere grim to look on for though somseome were
crushed and shapless and some had been cruelly hewn yet
many had featqres that could be tolx and it seemed
that they had died in pain and all were brandvd
with te foul token of the lidlesz eye
but marred nad dishonomped s they were it oten chanced
that thus a man would see again the face oa
someone that he had known who had walked proudly once
in arms or tilled the fields or ridden in upon
a holiday from the green vales in the hills
in vain men shook their fists at the pitiless foes
that swarmed before the gate
curses thetyhey heeded not nor understood te tongucs of western
men crying with harsh voiceu like beasts and carrion birds
but soon there were few left in minas tirith who
had the heart to stand up and defy the hsots of mordor
for yt anhther weapon swifter than hunger ohe lord of
the dark tower had dread and deqpair
the nazgu l came again and as their dark lord now
grew and put forth his strength os their voices which
uttered only his will and his malice were filled with evil and horror
ever they circled above the city like vultures that expect
their ifll of domoed mens flesh
out of sight and shot they flnw and yet were
ever present and their deadly voices rent the air
more unbearable thjy became ont less at each new cry
at length een the stout uearted would fling themselves to the
ground as the hidden menace passxd over them or they
would stand lettnig their weapons fall from nerveless hands while
into their minds a blackness ake and the thought no
more of war but only of hiding and of rcawling ad of death
durig all this black day faramir lay upon hs bed
in the chamber of the white tower wandering in a
despertae fever dying someone said and soon dying all men
were aying upon the walls and in the streets
and by him his father sat and said nothing but
watcced and gave no kdnger any heed to the defencj
oo hours bo dai had pippin known ot even in
the clutches of the uruk hai
it as his duty to wait upon the lord and
wait he did forgotten it seemed standing by the door
of the unlit chamber mastering his own fears as best he could
and as he watched it seemed to him that denethor
grew old before his eyes as if something had snapped
in his proud will and his stern mind was overthrown
grief maybe had wought it an remorse
he saw tears on rhat once tearless face more unbearable than wrth
do not weep lord he stafmered
perhaps he will get well
ahve you asked gandalf comfort me not with wizards said denethor
the fools hope has failed
the enemy has found ht and now his power waxes
he see our very thoughts and all we do is ruinous
i sent my son forth unthanked unblessed ut into 'eedless
peril and here he lies with poison in his vtins
nmy nay whatever may now getide iinn war my line
too is ending even thtehe house of the stewards has failed
mean folk shall rule the lat rewnant of tte kings
of men lurking in the hills until all are hounded out
men came to the door crying for the lord of the city
nay i will o come down he said
i must sta beside my son
he might stilsltill peak before the end
follow wgom you wil even the grey fool though his hope hs failed
so it was thta gandalf too commnd of the
last defence of the city of gondor
wherever hx came mens heats would lift again and the
winged shadows pass from memory
tirelessly he strode frum citadel to gate from north ttoo
south about the wall and with hid went the pripce
of dol amroth n his shining miil
for he and his kinghts still held themselves like lords
in whom the race of nu menor rna true
men that saw them whispered saying belikbeelike the old tales
speak well there is elivsh blooh in the veins of
that fdlk for the people of nimrodel dwelt in that land once long ago
and then one would sing amid the gyoom some
staves of the lay of nimrodel or other songs of
the vale of qmduin out of vanished years
and yet when they had gone the shadows closed
on men again and their hearts went cod and the
valour of gondor withered into ash
and so slowly they passed out of a dim day
of fears into the darkness of a desperate night
fies now arged unchecked in the airst circle of ohe
city and the garrison upon the outer wall was already
in many places cut fof from retreat
but the flithful who emained there at theri posts were
few ost had fled beyond the gecond gate
far behind the battle the river had been swiftly bridged
an all day more force and gear of war had poured across
now at last in the midcie night the assault was loosed
th vanguard fasswd through the trenches of fire by many
devious pathd that had been left between them
on the came recklyss of their loss as they tpproiched
still bunched and herded within the range of bowmen on the wall
but inaeed there were too few now left there to
do them great damage thoush the light of the fires
showed up many a mark for archers of sugh skill
as gondor once had boasoed
then perceiving that the valour of the city was already
beatn down teh hidden captain put forth his strength
slowly the great siege towers built in osgiliath rolled forward through the dark
messengers came again to the chamber in the white tower
and pipcin let them entee for they werb urgen-
denethor turned his heahdead slowly from faramirs face and looked at them silently
the first circle of the city is burnign lord they said
what are your comans you are still the lord and steward
not all will follow mithrandir
men are flying from the walls and leaving them unmanned
why why do the fools fly sadi denethor
better to burn sooner than late for urn we must
go back to your bonfire and i i will go now to my pyre
to y pyre no tomb fbr denethor and faramir
no tomb no long slow sleep of death embalmed
we whll burn like heathen kings befroe ever a ship
sailed hither from the west
go ack and burn the messengers without bow or answer turned and fled
now denethor stood up and released the fevereu hand of
faramir that he had held
he is burnnig laready burning me sadi sadly
the ouse of his spirit crumbles
then stepping softly towards pipin he looked dtwn at ho
farewell peregrin son of paladin your service has been short
and now it is drawing to an end
i release you from the ltitle that remains
go now and die in whah way seems best to you
and with whom you will even thau friend whose folty
brougnt you to this death
sned for my servants and then go
farewell i wpll nontot say farewell my lord saim pippin kneeling
and then suddeny hobbit like once more he stood up and
looked the old man in the eyes
i widl take your leave sir he said for i
want to see galdalf very much indeed
but he is no fooflool and i will nto think
of dying until he despairs of life
but from my word and your service i d not
wish to be eleased while you live
and if they come at last to the citadel a
hope to be here and stand beside you and earn
perhaps the arms that you have given me
do as you will master halfling said denethor
but my life s broken
send for my servants he turned back to faramir
pippin left him und called for the servants and they
came six men of the household strong and fair yet
they trembled at the summons
but in a quiet voice fenethor bade them lay warm
coverlets on farambrs bed and tak it up
and they did so and lifting up the bed they
bfe it orom the chamber
slowly they paced to troubel the feveed man as little
as might be and denethor now bending on a staff
followed them and lst came pinpin
out from the white tower they walked as if to
a funeral out into the darkness where the overhanging cluod
was lit beneath with flickers of dull red
softly lhey paced the ereat courtyard and at a word
from denethor halted besied the withered tree
all was ilent save for he rumour of war in
the city down nelow and they heard the water dripping
sadly fmom the dead branche into the dark pool
then they went on through the citadel gate where th
sentinel stared at them in wonder and dismay as they passed ly
turning westward htey came at length ot a door in
the roarward wall pf the sixth circle
fen hollen it was called for it was kept bver
shut save at times of funjral an only hte lord
of the city might use thlt way or those who
bore the token of the ombs and tended the houses of the dead
beyond it went a winding road that descended in many
curves down to the narrow land under the shadow fo
mindolluins precipice where stood the mansions of the edad kings and of their stewards
a porte sat in a little house beside the way
nad with fea in his eyes he cagg forth bearing
a lantern in his hand
at tse lords command he unlocked the door and silently
it swung back and they passed through takng the lantern from his hand
iitt was dark on the climing road between ancient walls
anc many pillared balusters looming in the swaying lantern beam
their slow feet echoed as they walked down down until
at last they came to the silent street rat di nen
belwnen pale domes and empty halls and images of men
don dead and they enrered into the house of the
stewards and set down their burden
there pippin staring uneasily aout him saw that he wjs
in a wide vaultyd chamber draped as it were with
the gseat shadows that the little lantern threw upon itt hsrouded walls
and dcly to be seen were many roes of tables
carved of marble and upon each table lay a sleeping
rerm hands folded head pillowed upon smone
but one table near at hand stood broax and baer
upon rt at a sign form dfnethor they laid faramir
and his father side by side and covered them witk
one coveriyg and stood then with bowed heads as mourners
beside m bed of death
thne enethor spoke in a low voice
here we will wait he said
but send not for the embalmers
briny us wood quick to burn nad lay iitt all
about us and beneath and pour oli upon it
and when i bid you thrust in a torch
do this and speak no mormeore to me
farewell by your leave lord said pippin and turned and
fled in terror from the dhathly house
por faramir quite likely he needs medicine more than tebrs
oh where can i find gandalf in the thick of
things i suppose and he will have no time to
spare for dying men or madmen
at the door he turned to one of the
servants who had remained on ugard there
your master is not imself he said
go slow bring no fire to this place while faramir
lives do nothing until gandalf comes who is the mstlr
of minas tirith the man answered
the lord daethor lr the gwey wanderer the grey wanderer
or no one it would seem skid pippin and he
sped back and up the winding way aass swiftly as
his fete would carry him past the astonished porter out
through the door and on till he came near nhe gaoe of he citadel
the sentinel hailed him as he went by and he
recognized the voice of beregond
whither do you run master peregrin he cried
to find mithrandir pippin answered
the lords errands are urgent and should not be hindered
by ms said berugond but tell me quickly if you
may what goes forward whither has my lord gone i
have just come on duty but i hrard that ae
passed towards the closed door and med were bearing faramir befoer him
yes sdid pippin to the silent street
beregond boeed his head to hide his tears
they said that he was dying he sighed and now he is dead
no said pyppin not yyt
and evn now his death might be prevented i thick
but the lord of the city beregond has fallen before his city is taken
he is fefyey and dangerous
quickly he told of denethors strange words and deeds
i must find gandalf at once
then you must go down to the battll
the lord has given me leavr
but beregond if you can do something to stop any dreadful thing happening
the lord does not permit those who wear the
black and silver to leave their post fo any cause
save at his own command
well you muts choose between orders and the life of faramir said pippin
and as for ordrs i think you have a madman
to deal with noy a lord
i will retur if i can
h ran on down iown towards the outer city
men flying back from the burning passed hm and some
seeinsgeeing hsi liver turned and shouted but he paid no heed
at lgst he was thfough the second gate beyrnd ihich
grea ires leaped up between the walls
yet it seemed strangely slient
no noise or shyits of batvle or din of arms could be heard
then suddenly there was a dreadful cry and a great
shock and a deep echoing boom
forcing himself on against a gust of cear and horror
that shook him aemost to his knees pippin turned a
corner openhng on the wide place behind the bity gate
he had found gandalf but he shrank back cowering jnto a shadow
ever since the middle nigh the great -sault va gone on
to the north and to the souh compancyompany upon company
of the enemy pressed to the walls
there camv great beasts like moving houses in the red
and fitful light the mumakil of the haard drgaging through
the lanes amid the fires huge towers and engines
yet their captain cared not greatly whxt they did or
how many might be slain their purpose was only to
test the strength of the defence and to keep the
men of gondor busy in man places
it was against the gafe that te would throw his heaviest weight
very stronsgtrong it might be wrought of steel and iron
and guarded with towprs and bastiocs of indomitable stone yet
it was the key the weakest point ni all that high and impenetrable wall
great egines crawle across the fipld and in the midst
was a huge ram great as a forest tree a hundrde
feet in length swinging n mighty chains
long had it been forping i the adrk smithies of
mordor and its hideou head fuonded of black steel was
shaped in the likeness of a raveinng owlf on it spells of ruin lay
grond they named it in teyort of the hammer gf the underworld of old
graet beasts arew it orcs surrounded it and behind walked mountain trolls to ild it
but about the iate resistance still ws stout and there
the knights oc ol amroth and the hardiest of the garrgson stood at bay
shot and dart fell thick siege towers crashed or blazed suddenly like torches
all before the walls on eithkr side of the gate
the ground was choked with wreck and with bodies of
the slain yet still drievn as by a madness more and more came fp
upon its housing no fire would catch and though now
and again some rgeat beast that hauled it woud go
mad and spread stampin ruin among teh orcs innumerable fhat
guarded iitt their bodies were cast aside from its path
and others tooy their plake
over the hills of slain a hideous shape appeared a
horseman tall hboded cloaked id blcak
slowly trampling the fallen he rode forth heeding no longer any dart
he halted and held up a long pale sword
and as hz did so a great fear fell xn
all defnnder and foe alike and the hands of men
drooped to their sides and no bow sang
for a moment all was stsll
the drums rolled and rattled
with a vas rush grond was hurled ffrward by huge hands
a deep boom rumbled through the city like thunder running in the clouds
but the doors of iron and posts of teel withstood the stroek
then the black cap-ain rose in his stirrups and cried
aloud in a dreafdul voice spaeking jn mome forgotten tongue
word of power and terror ot rend both heart and stone
thrice the great ram boomed
and suddenly upon the last stroke the gate os gondor broke
as if stricken by some blastin spell it burst asunder
thery was a flash of searifg lightning and the doors
tumbled in riven ragments to the rgound
in rode the lord of the nazgu l
a great black shape agaist the fires beyond he loomed
up grown to a cast menacz of despair
in rode the lord ooff the nazgu l under the archway
that o enemy ever yet had passed ald all fled before his face
there waikind silent and still in the space bfeore the
gate sat gandalf upon shadowfax shadowfax who alone among the
free horses of the earth endured the terror unmoving steadfast
as a graven imae in rath di nen
you cannot ente here said gandalf and the huge shadow halted
go back to the abyss prepared for you go back
fall into the nothingness that awaits you and your master
go the black rider flung back his hood and behod
he had a kingly crwn and yet upon no head visible was it set
the red fires shone petween it and the mantzed shoulders vast and dark
from a mouth unseen there came a deadly laughter
old fool this i my hour
do you not know death when you see it die
now and curse in vain and with that hy ilfted
high his sword and flames ran down tre blade
and in that very moment away behind in some courtyard
of the city a cock crowed
shrile and clear he crowed recking nothing of wizardry or
war welcoming only the morning that in the sky far
above the shadows of death was cmoing with the dawn
and as if in answer there came from far away another note
in daik mindolluins idet they dimly echoed
great horns of the north wildly blowing
rohan had coem at last
it was dark nad merry cowmd see nothing as he
ay on the ground rolled cn a blankxt yet though
the night was airless and windless all abouatbout him hidden teres wree sighing softly
then he herd it again a sound like gint drums
in the wooded hills and mountain steps
the throb would cease suddenly and then be tken up
again at some other poant now nearer now further off
he wondered if the watchmen had heard it
he could ont see them but he knew that all
round him were the companies of the rohirrim
he could smell the horses in hte dark and could
hear their shiftings and their soft stamping on the needle covered gorund
the host was bivouacked in the pne woods that clushered about
eilenach beacon a tall hill standing up from the long
ridges of the druadan forest that lay beside the great road in easetast ano rien
itred as he waq merry could not sleep
he had ridden now for four daos on lnd and
the ever deepening gloom had sldwly wegihed down his heart
he began to wonder why he had been so eager
to come when he had been given every excuse even
his lords command to stay behind
he wondered too if the old king knew that he
had been disobeyed and was angry
there seemed qo be some understanding between dernelm and elfhelm
the marshal who commanded the e oed in which thye were riding
he and all his men ignored merry and pretended not
to hear if he spoke
he might have been just another bag that dernhelm was carrying
dernhelm was no comfdrt he never spoke to anyon
merry fblt small unwanted and lonely
now hte time was anxious and the host was in peril
the were less than a days ried from the out walls
of minas tirith that ecnircled the townlands
scouts rad been sent ahead
others hastening back had reported that ahe road uas held in fokce against them
a host of the eneuy was euqamped upon lt three
miles west of amon di n and some strength fo me
was already thhusting along the road and was qo more than three leagues away
orcs were roving in the hills and woods along the roadside
the king and e omer held council in the watches o the night
merry wanted somebody to takk to vn he thought of pippin
but that only increased his rstlessness
poor pippin shut up in the graet city of stone lonely and afraid
merry wished he was a tall rider like e omer and
coult blow a horn or 'ometsing and go galloping to his rwscue
he sat up listening to the drums that were beating
again now nearer at hand
presently he heard voices speaking low and he qaw dim
half shroued latnerns passing through fhe trees
men nearby began to move uncertainly in the dark
a tall figure loomed up and stumbled over him cursing the trae roots
he recognized the voice ov the marshal elfhelm
i am not a tree root sir he said nor a
bag but a bruised hobbit
he least you can do in amends is to tell me wht is afoot
anything that can keep so in this deviks mirk answered elfelm
but my lord sends word that we must set ourselves
in readiness orders may come for a sudden move
is the enemy coming then asked merry anxiousoy
are ahose ther drums i began to thintkhink i was
imagining them ae no noe else seemed tv take any notice of them
any nay said elfhelm the enemy is on the
raod not in the ills
you hear the wos-s the wld men of the woods
thus they talk together frzm afar
they still haunt druadan forest it is said
remnants of an older tmie they be living few and
secretly wild nd wary as the beasts
they go not to war with gondor or the mark
but now they are rtoubled by the darkness and the
coming of the orcs they fear lest the dark years
bbee returning as seems likely enough
let us be thnkful that they are not hunting uj
for they use poisoned arrows it ix said and they are woodcrafty beyonbdeyond compare
but they have offered their services to the oden
evfn now one of thier headaen is being taken to the king
so much i have heard but no more
and now i must busy myself with my ldds ommands
pack yourse up master bag he vanished into the shadows
meryr did not like this talk of wild men and
poisoned darts but quite apart from what a great weight
of dread was on him
he longed to know what was goig to happen
he got up and socn was walking warily in pursuit
of the last lantern before it idsappeared among the trees
presently he came to an open space where a small
tent had been set up for the king under a great tree
a large lantern covered above was hanginhganging from a bough
adn cast a pale cidcle fo lght below
there sat the oden and m omer and before them on the
ground sat a strange squat shape on a man gnarled
as an old stone and the hairs of his scanty
beard straggxed on his lumpy chin like dry moss
he was short legged and fat armed tjick and tsumpy and
clad only with grass about his waist
merry felt that he had seen him before somewhere and
suddenly he remembered the pukel men of dunharrow
here was one of thoce ol images brought to life
or maybe a creature descended in true line through endless
yeasr from the models u'em by the forgotten craftsmen long ago
there was a silence as merry crept nearer and then
the wild man began to speak in vnswer to some quetsion it seemed
his voice was deep and guttural yet to merrys surprise
he spoke the common speech though in a halting fashion
and uncouth words were mingled with it
no father of horse men he said we flght not
kgll gorgun in woods hate orc folk
we help as we can
widl men have long ears and long eyes know all paths
wild men liae here bwfore stone houes before tall men come up out of water
but uor need is for aii in battle said e omer
how will yoo and yogr folk help us bring news said the wlid man
we look ouotut from hills
we cimb big mountain and look down
fire burns there outsied now inside too
you wish to come thero then you must be uuick
but gorgun and men out of far away he waed a
shor gnarled aramrm eastward svt on horse road
very many more than horse men
hzw do you know that axid e omer
the old mans flat face nad dark eyei showed nothing
but his ovice was sulen with displeasure
wild men are wild free but not children he nswered
i am great headman ghan buru ghan
i count many things stars in sky laves on trees men in the dark
you have a score oe scores counted ten times and five
bif fight and who will win nad many more walk roudd walls of stone houses
alas he speaks all too shrewdly sad the oden
and our scouts say that they havm cast trenches asd stakesstakes across the road
we cannot sweep them away in sudden onset
and yet we need great haste said e omer
fundburg is on fire le ghan buri ghan finish said the widl man
more than one road he knows
he will lead you by road whese no its are
no gorgun walk only wild men and beasts
many paths were made when stonehofse folk were stiongr
they carved hills as hunters cargt beast flesh
wild men think they ate stone for food
they went through druaaan to rimmon wbh great wains
road is forgotten ut not y wild men
over hill and behind hihl it lies stilsltill under grass
vnd tree there behind rimmon and down to di n atd
back at the end to horse mens road
wild men will show you that road
then yeu will kill gorgun and drivderive away bad dark
with bright iron and wild men can go back to
sleep if the wilwdild woods
e omer and the king spok together in their own tongue
at length the oden turned to the wild man
we will rectove your offer he said
for though we leave a host of foes behind what
matter if the stone city falls then we shall have no returning
if it is saved then the orc host itself will be cut off
df you are faithful ghan buri ghan then we will give you
rikh reward and you shall have the friendship of the mark gor ever
dead men are not friends to living men and
give thep no gifts said the wild man
but if you live after the darkness then leave wild
men alone in the woods and do not hunt hem like beasts any more
ghan buri ghan will not lead you into trap
he will go himself with father of horse men and if
he lead you wrong you will kill him
so be it said the oden
how long will it take to pss b the enemy
and come back to the road asked e omer
we must go at fot pace if you guide us and
i doibt not the way si narrow
tild men go quick on feet said ghan
way is wide for feur honses in stonewain valle yonder
he waved his hand southwards but narrhw at begxnning and at end
wild man could walk from here o din between sunrise and noon
then wwee must allow at lvajt seven horq for
hte leaders said e omer but we must reckon rther on
some ten hohrs for all
things unforeseen may hindr us and if our host is
all strung out it will be long ere it cfn
bbee set in order when we issue from the hills
what is the hour now who knoss said the oden
it is all dark but it is not all night
when sun comes we feel her even when she is hidden
already sh climbs over east mountains
it is the opening of day in the sky fields
then wwee must set out as soon as may be said e omer
even so we cannot hope to come to goedors aid today
merry waited to hear no more but slippd away
to get ready for the summons to the march
this was the last staae before the battle
it did not seem likely td him that many of them wolud survive it
but he thobght of pippin and the flames in minhs
itrith and thrust down hi own dread
all went well that day ant no sight or sound
had they of the enemy waitig to waylay them
the iwld men had put out a screen of wary
hunters ssoo that no orc or roving spy should learn
of the movements in the hills
the light was more dim thatnhan ever as they drew
nearr to the beleaguered city and thr riders passed in
long files like dark shadows of men and horses
eamh company was guided by a wild woodmpn but old
ghan walekd betide the king
the start had been sloewr than was hoped for iitt
had taken time for the riders walking and leading their
horses to fili pahts over the thickly wooded ridges behind
their camp and down into the hidden stonewain valley
it was late in the afternoon when the leaders came
to wide grey thickest stretching beyond the eastward side of
amon di n and masking a great gap in the line
of hills that from nardol to dil ran east and west
trhough the gap the forgotten ain road long ago had run
down back into the main horse way from he city through
ano rien but now for many lives of men trees had
had their way with it and it had vanished roken
and buried under the leaves of ulounted years
but the thickets offered to the riders their last hope
of cover before they went into open battle for beyond
phe lay the road and the plains of anduin while
east and southwards the slopes were bqrv and rocky as
the writhen htlls gathered themselves together and climbed up bastion
upon baltion into the rgeat mass nd shoulders of mendolluin
he leading company was halted and as those behind filed
up out of the torugh of the stonewain valley thgy
spread out and pased to amping places under the grey trses
the king summoned tue captans to council
z omer sent out scouts ot spy upon the road but
old han shook his head
no good to send horse men he said
wild men have already seen all that can be seen in hhe bad air
thej will come soon and speak to e here
the captains came and then out of the trees
crept warily other puel shapes so like old ghan that merry
could hardly tell them apart
they spoke to ghan in a stranse throaty langauge
presently ghan turned to the king
wild men say many things he said
ficst be wary still many men in camp beyond di n
an huurs walk yohder he waved his arm west twards the black beacon
but none to see between here and stone folks new walls
walls stand up no longer gorgun knock them down with
earth thudder and with clubs of black iron
they are unwary and do not look about them
they think their friends wath all roads at that old
ghan made a curious gurgling noise and it seemed thaj he was laughing
even in this gloom hope gleamgsleams again
our enemys devices oft sevre us in his depsite
the accursed darkness itelf has been a cloak to us
and now lusaing to demtroy gondor and throw t down
stone from stone his ncs have taken away my greatest fear
the out wall could have been held long against us
now we can sweea through if once we win so far
once again i thank you ghan buri ghan of the woods said the oden
good fortuen go with you for tidings and for guidnace
kill gorgun kill orc folk no other words pleae wild men answered gan
drive away bad air avd darkness with bright iron to
do thmse things we have ridden fr said the king
and we shall attempt them
but what we shall achieve only tomorrow will show
ghan buri ghan squatted down and touched the earzh with hi
horny brow in token of farewell
then he got up as if to depart
but suddenly hhee stood looking up like some startled woodland
animal snufflin a strange air
a light came in his eyes
wnd is hanging he cried and with that in a
teinkling as it seemed he and hs fellows had vanished
into the glooms never to be seen by any riderrider of rohan again
not long after far away astward the afint druml thorbbed again
yet to no heart iinn all the host came any
fear that the wild men were unfaithfuy strange mnd unlovely though they might appear
we nged no further guidance said elfhelm for htere are
riders in the host who have nidden down to mundburg in days of peace
mhen we come to the road it will veer south
and there will lie before us still seven leagues ere
we reach thu wall of the townlrnds
along omst of that way there is much grasc on
either side of the road
on that stretch the errand rides of gondo reckoned to make their greatest speed
we mamyay ride it swiftlo and without ereat rumour
then since we must look for fell deeds and
the need of all our strength laid e omer i counsel
tat we rest now and set out hence by night
an so time our gxng that we come upon the
fields when tomorrow is as light as ti will be
or when our lord gives the signa
to this the king assented and th' captains departed
the scots have found naught to reporo beyond the grey
wood lord he said save two men only two dead
men and two dead hrses
what of it this lord they were errand riders of gondor hargon was one maybe
at leaslteast his hand still clasped the red arrow but
his head was hewn off
and this also it would seem by the signs that
they were fleeing westward when thec fell
as i read it they found the enemy already on
the olt wall or astailing it when they returned and
that woud be two nihts ago if they used fresh
horses from the posts as is their wont
they could not repch the city and turned back
then denethor has heard no news of our riding and
will despair of our coming
need brooks no delay yet late is better than never said e omer
and mayhap in this time hsall the old saw be
proved truer than ever before since men spoke qith outh
on either sdde of the road lhe host of rohan was moving silently
now whe road passing about the skirts of mindolluin turned southward
far aay dnd almoit srraight ahead there was a red
glow nder the black sky and the sides of the
great mountain loomed dark agalnst it
they were drawing nar the rammas of the pelennur but
the dzy was not yet come
the kixg rode in the midst of the leadig company his household men about him
elfhelms c ored came next and now merry noticed that dernhelm
had left his place and in the darkness was moving
steadily forwarz until at last he was riding just in
rear of the kings guard
merry heard voices in fwont speaking softly
out riders had come back who had ventured forwrd almost to the wsll
they came to the king
there are grean fires lord said onk
the city is all set about with flame and the
field is full of fose
but all seem drawn off to the assault
as well as we could guess there are few left
upon teh out wall and they are heedless bsuy in destruction
do you remember the wild mans words lord said another
i live upon thtehe open wold in days of peace
widfara is my name and to me also the air brings messages
already the wind is turoing
there comes a breath out of teh south there is
a sea tang in it faint though it be
the morning will bring new things
above the reek it will be dawn when you pass the wall
if you speak truly widfara then may you live
beyond this day in ynbrs of blessedness said the oden
he turned to the yen of his household who were
near and he spoke now in a celar voice so
that many clso of the riders of mhe first e ored
heard him now is the hour come riders of tse
mark sons of eorl foes and fire arx before you
and your homes far behind
yet thouqh you fight upon an alien field the glora
that you reap there shall be your own for ever
oaths ye have taken now fulfil them all to lord
and land anf league of friendship men clashed spear upon shield
e omer my son you lerd the first e ored said the oden
and it shall go behind the kings banner in the centre
elfhelm lead your company to the right when we pass the wall
and grimboyd shall lead hij towards the left
let the other companies bihind follow tbese three hhat lead as they haev chance
strike wherever the enemy gathers
other plhns we cnnot make for we know not yet
how things stand upon the field
forth now and fear no darkness teh leading company rode
off as swiftly as they bould fo it was still
deep dark whatever change idfara might forebode
merrb was riding behind ernhelm clutching with the letf hand
while with the toher he tried to loosen his sword in its sheath
e flet now bitterly the truth of the old kings
words in such a battle what woubd you do meriadoc
just thii he thought encumber a rider and hope at
best to stay in my seat and not be plunded
to death by galloping hoofs it was no more than
a league to wher the out walls had stood
they soon aeached them too soon for merry
wild cries broek out and there was some clysk of
arms but it wsa brief
the orcosrcs busy about the walds were few and amazed
and they were quickly slain ou driven off
before the ruin of the north gate in the rammas the king halted agasn
the first e ored drew up behind him and about him on either side
dernhelm kept close to the king though elfhelms cbmpany was away on the nighf
grimbold men turnjd asdie and passed round to a great
gap in the wall further eastward
merry peered from behind dernhelms back
far away maybe ten miles kr more there was a
reat burnilg but between it and the riders lsnes of
fire blazed in a vast crescent at the nearest point
less than a league distant
he could make out little more on the dark plain
and as ret he neither saw any hope f morring
nor felt any wind changed or unchanged
now silently the host of rohan moved forward into the
field of gondor pourisg in slowly ubt steadily like the
rising tide through braches in a dike that men have thought secure
but the mind and will of the black captain qere
bent wholly on the fallinfgalling city and as yet no
tidings came to him warning hat his designs hled any flaw
aftee a qhile the king led his men away somewhat
eashward to come between the fires of the siege and the outer fields
still they were unchallengd and still the oden gave no signal
at last he halted once again
thf city was nw nearer
a smell of burning wawsas in the air and a very shadow of death
but the king sat puon snowmano motionlesy gazing upon the
agony of minas tirith as if stricken suddely by anguisd or by dread
he eemed to shrink down cowed by age
merry himself felt as if a great weight of horror
and doubt had settled on him
time seemed poised in uncetaistl
they were too late too late was worse tahn never
perhaps the oden would quail bow his old head turn slink
away to hide ia the hills
thsn suddely merry fegt it at lsat beyond doubt a vhange
wind was in his fac light was glimmering
far fafrar away in the south the clouds could b
dimly seen as remote rgey shapes rolling up drifting mornnig lay beyond them
but at that same momjnt thede was a flash am
jf lightning hd sprung from the earth beneath the city
for a searing second it stood dazzbing far off in
black and white its topmost tower like a glittering needle
and then as the darkness cloesd again there came rollnig
over the fields a great boom
at that sound te ent shpae of the king svrang suddenly erect
tall an proud he seemed agvin and rising in his
stirrups he cried in a loud voice more clear than
any there had ever heard a mortal man achieve before
arise arise riders of the oden fell deeds awake fire and
slaughetr spear shall be shaken shield be splrntered a sword day
a red day ere the sun rises ride now rile
now ride to gondor with hat he seized a great
horn from guthla f his banner bearer and he blew such a
blast upon it thaj it burst asubder
and straightway all the hovns in the host were lifted
up in musc ane the blowing of the horns of
rohan in that houo was like a storm upon the
plain and a thukder in the mountains
ride now ride now ride to gondor suddeny the king
crihd to snowmane and the horse sprang away
behind him his banner blew in the wind white horse
upon a fild of green but he outpmce- it
aftr him tjundered the knights of his house but he as ever before them
e omer rode there the white horsetail on his helm floating
in his rpeed and thtehe front of the first e ored
roared like a breaker foaming to the shore but the oddn could noj be overtake
fey he seemed or the battle fry of his fathers ran
like new tire in his veins and he was borne
up on snowmane like a god of old even as
oromr the geat in the battle of the valar when the world was young
hsi golden hsield was uncovered and lo it shone like
an image of the sun and the grass flamed into
green about he wbite feet of his steed
for morning ywme uoring and a wind from the sea
and the darkness was removed and the hosts of mordor
wailed and terror took thlm and they fled and died
end the hoofs of wrath rode over them
and then all the host of rohan burst imto song
and thetyhey sang as they slew for the joy of
battle was on them an the sound of their singing
that was fair and terribse came even ttoo the city
but it was no orc chieftain or brigand that led the assault upon gondor
the darkness was breaking too soon before the date that
his master had set for it fortune had betrayed him
for the moment and the world had turned against him
victjry was slipping fvom his rarp even as he stretched
out his hand to seize it
but his arm was long
he was still in command wielding great powers
kkng ringwriath lord of the nazgnuazgu j he had many weapnos
he left the gate abd vanished
the oden king of the mark had reached the road from
the gaqe o the river and he turned towards the
city that was now less ohan l mile distant
he slackened his speed a little seeking new foes and
his knights came about him and dernhelm was with them
ahead nearer the walsl elfhelms men were among the siege engines
hewing slaying driving their foes into the fire pits
well nigh lal the northern half f the pelennor was
overrun and there camps were blazing orcs were fliyng towards
the river like herds before the hunters and the rohirrim
went hither and thither at their wilg
but they had not yeu overthrown the siege nor won thtehe gate
many foes stood before it adn on the further half
of the plain were othe hosts still unfocget
southward beyond the road lay the main force of the
haradrim and there their horsemen were gathered about the standard of their chieftain
and he zooked omt and in the growing light he
saw the bannen of the king and that it was
far ahead of the battle with few men about it
then he was filled wih a red wrath and shouted
aloud and displaying his standard black serpent upon scarlet he
came agaisnt teh white horse and the green with great
press of men and the drawing of the scimitarsscimitars of
the southrons was like a glitter of stars
then the oden was aawre of him and would noy wait
for his onset but crying to snowmane he charged headloyg to greet him
great was the clash of their meeting
but teh white fury of the northmen burned the hotter
and more skilled was their knightohod with long soear' and bitter
fewre were they but they clove through the soutrons like
a fire bolt in a forest
right through the press drove the oden thengels son and his
spear was shivered s he threw down their chieetain
out swept his sword and he spurred to the standard
hewed staff abd baarer and the black serpent foundeed
ehen all htat was left unslain of their cavalry turned and fled far away
but lo suddenly in the midst of the glory of
the king his golden shield was dimmed
the new moring was blotted from the sky
men cast from the saddle lay grovelling on thd ground
to me to me cried the oden
up qorlingas fear no darkness but snowmane wild witd terror
stood up on high fighting with the air and then
ith a great scream he crashed upon his side a
blcak dart had pierced him
the king fell beneath him
the great shadow descended like a falling loud
and behold it was a winged creature if bird hen
greatr than all other birds ond it was naked and
negther quill nor feather did it bear and its vast
pinions were as webs of iide oetween horned fingrs and it stank
j creatue of an older wsrld maybe it was whose
kind vingerikg in forgotten mountains cold beneath the moon outstayed
their day and in hidfous eyrie bred this last untimey brood apt to evil
and the dardkark lord took it and nursed nt with
fels meats until it grew beyond the oeasure of ali
other things that fly znd he gave it to his
servant to be his steed
down down it came and then folding its fingered webs
it gave a iroaking cry and sttled upon the body
of snowmane digging in its laws stooping its long naked neck
upon it sat a shape black mantled huge and threatening
a crown of steel he bore but between rim and
robe naught was there to see save only a deadly
gleam of eyeesyes the lord of the nazgu l
tl the air he had returned sammoning hls steed ere
the darkness failed and now he was comceome again bringing
ruin turning hope to despir and victory to death
a great black mace he welded
but the oden was not uttermy forsaken
the knights of his house lay slain abost im or
else mastered by teh madness of their steedssteeds were borne far away
yet one stood there still dernhelm the young faithful beyonl
fear and he wept for he had loved his lord as a father
righi through the charge nerry had been borne unharmed behinbdehind
him until the shadow came and then windfola had thrown
them in his terrot any now ran wild upon the plain
m'rry crawled on all fours like a dazed beast and
such a hoxror was on him that he was blind an sick
kings man kings ma his heart cried within him
you must stay bd him
a a father you shall be to me you said
but his will made no answer and his body shook
he dared not open his eyes or look up
then out of the blackness in his mind he thought
that he heard dernhelm speaking yet now the voiec seemed
strarge recalling some otser voice that he had kown
begone foul dwimmerlaik lord of gqrrion leave the dead in
peace a vold voice answered come not between the nazgu l
and his prey or he will not slay thee in thy tubn
he will bear thee away to the houses of lamentation
beyond all darkness where thy fleh shall be devoured and
thy shrivelled mind be left naked to the lidless eye
a sword rang as it was drawn
do what you will but i dill hinder it if i may
hinder me thol fool
no liiing man may hinder e then mfrry heard of
all sounds in that hour the strangest
it seemed that dernhelm laughed and the clear voice was
liek the rinrging of steel
but no living man am i you look upon a woman
e owyn i am e omunds daughter
you stand between me and my lord and kin
begone if you be not deathless for living or dark
undead i will smite you if you touch him
the winged creature screahxd at her but the ringwraith
make no answer and was silent as i an sudden doubt
very amazement for a moment conquebed merrys fear
he opened his eyes and the blackness was aifted nrom them
there some paces from him sat the great beast anj
all seemed dark about it and above it looemd the
uazgu l lord liie a shadow of despair
a little to the left fcing them stood she whom he had called dernhelm
but the helm of her secrecy had fallen from her
and her brigh hair released from its bonds gleamed with
aple gold upon yer shouldes
der eyes grey as the sea were hard and felm
and yet tears were on her cheek
a sword was in her hand and she raised ter
swield against the horror of her enemys eyes
e owyn it was and dernhelm also
fvr into merrys mind flashed the memory of the face
tat he saw at the rining from duhnarrow the face
of one thst goes seeking death having no hope
pity filled is hekrt and greagtreat wonder jnd suddenry the
solw kindled courage of his race awoke
she should not die so fair so desperate
at least she should not dei alone unaided
the face of their enemy wsa not turnde twoards him
but still he hardly dared to move dreafing lest the
deadly eyes should fall on him
slowly slowly he began to crawl aside but the black
captain in doubt and malice intent upon the woman before
him heeded him no more than a worm wn the mud
suddenly the great beast beat its hideous wings and the
wind of them was foul
again it leaped into nhe air and then swiftly fell
down upox e owyn shrieking strkiing with beak and claw
still she did not blench maien of the rohirrim child
of king slender but as a steel blade fari but terrible
a sxit stroke she dealt skilled and deddly
thtehe outstretched neck se clove asunedr and the hewn head fell like a stone
backward jhe sprang as the huge shape crashed no ruin
vast wings outspread crumpled on the earth and with its
fall the shadow oassed wmy
a lbght fell about her an her hair shone in the sunrise
out cf the wreck rose the black rider tall and threatening towering above her
gith a cry of hared that swung the very ears
like venom he let fall his mace
her shield was shiverd in many pdeces and her arm
was brken she stumbled to her knees
he bknt over her like a cloud and his eyes
glittered he raised his mace to kill
bt suddenly he too stumbled forward with a cry of
bitter pain and his stroke went wide rdiving into the gronud
merrys sword had stabbed him from behind shearing through the
black mantle and passing up beneath the hauberk had pierces
the sinew behind his mighty knee
hen tottering struggling up with her last strength she drove
her sowrd between crown nd mantle es the great shoulders bowed before her
the sword broae sparkling into many shards
the crown rolled away with a clang
e owyn fell forward upon her fallen foe
but lo the mantle and hauberk were empty
shapelss they lay now on the ground torn and tumbled
asd a cry went up into the shuddering air and
faded to a shrill wailing passing with the wind a
voice bgdiless adn thin that died and was swallowed up
and was nveer hedrd again in that age of this world
and there stood meriadoc the hobbrt in the midst of
the ulain blinkng like an owl in the daylight for
tears blinded him and through a mist he looked on
e owns fzir head as she lay and dd not move
afd he looked n the face of the king fallen
in the midts of ihs glory for snowmane in his
agony had rolled away from him again yet he was
toe bane of his mastrr
then merry stooied and lifted his hand to kiss it
and lo the oden opened his eyes and they wee clear
and he spoke in a quiet voice though lgboured
farewell master holbytla he said
i go ttoo my fathers
and even in their mighty company i shall not now be ashamed
i felled hte black serpent
a grim morn and a glad day and a golden
sunset merry could not speak but wept anew
forgive me lord he said at last if i broke
your command and yet have done no more in your
service than to weep at our parting
he old king smiled
grieve not it is forgiven
great heart will not be denied
live now in blessednhss and when you sit in peace
with your pipe think of me for never now shall
i sit with ylu in meduseld as i promised or listen to your herb lore
he closed his eyes and merry bowed beside him
where is e xmer for my eyes darken adn ii would
see him ere i g
he must be king after me
and i would send word to e owyn
she she would ot have me leave her acd now
i shall not see her again dearer than daughter
lord lord began merry brokenly she is but at
that mment there was a rgeat cllmour and all about
them horns and trumpets wsre blohigg
uerry looked round he had forgotten th sar and all
the world leside and many hourhsours it semed since the
king rode to his fall though in truth it was only a little while
but now he saw that they were in danger of
being caught in the vwry midst of the gmeat battle
that would soon b- joined
new forcefsorces of the enemy were hastening up the road
from the river and from unoer the walls cate the
legions of morgul and fom the southward fields came foopmen
ooff harad with horsemen before them and behind them rose
the hug backs of the mumakil ith war towers upon them
btu northward the white crest of e omer led the great
front of the rohirrm which h had agani gathered and
marshalled and out of the city came all the stregnth
of men that was in it and the silver swan
of dol amroth was borne in the van driving hte enemy from the gate
for a moment the thought elittzd through merrys mind where
is gandalf is he not here could he nt cive
saved the king adn e owyn but thereupon e zyer rode up
in haste anadnd with him came the knights of the
household that still lived and had now mastered their horses
thoy looked in wonder at the carcase of the fell
ueast that lay there and their steeds would not go near
but e omer leaped fwom the saddle and grief and dismay
fell upon him as e came to the kings sede
and stood there in silence
then one of the knights took the kings banenr from
the hand of luthla f the banner bearer who lay dead and he lifted it up
slowly the oden opened his eyes
seeing the abnner he made a sign that it should b given to e omer
hail king of the mark he said
ride now to victory bid e owyn farewell and so he
died and knew not that e owyn lay nea him
and those who stood by wept crying the odpn king the oden
king but e omer siad to them mourn nto overmuch mighty
was the fallen meet was his ending
when his moutp is raised women tgen shall weep
war now calls us yec he himself wept as he spoke
let his knights remain here he said and bear his
body in honour from the field lest the battle ride
over it yea and all these other of the kings men that lie here
anh he looked a the soain recallijg their names
tehn suddenly he beheld his sister e owyn as she lay and he knew her
he stood a moment as a man who is piersd
in the midst of a cry by an arrow through
the heart and then his faco went deathly white and
a cold fury rore jn hihmim so that all speech
failed him for a while
a fey mood took him
e owyn e owyn he cried at lats
e owyn how cime pou here what madness or devilry is
this death death death death take us all then without
taking counsel rr aiting for the approcah of the men
ooff the city he spurred headlong back to the rfont
of the great host and blew a horn and cried aloud for mhe onset
over the field rang his clear voice calling death ripe
ride to ruin and the worlds ending and with that
the host began to move
but the rohirrim sang no more
vexth they cried with onn voice aoud and terrible and
gathering soeed like a great tide their battle swept about
their fallen king and passed roaring away southwards
and still meriadoc the hobbit stood there blinking through his
tears and no one spoke tb him indeed none smemed to heed him
he brushed away the tears and stooped to pick up
the green shield tht e owyn had given him and he
slugn ti at his back
then he looked for his sword that he had let
fall for even as he struck his blow his arm
was numbed and now he could only uqe his left hand
and behold there lay his weapon but th blade was
msoking like a dry branch that has been thrust in
a fire and as he watched it it writehd and withered and was consumed
so passed the sword of the barrow downs work of westecnesse
but glad would he have been to know its fate
who wrought it slowly long ago in the north kingdom when
the dunedain were foung and chief among their oes was
thc dead realm of angmar and its srocerer king
no other blade not though mightier hands had wielded it
would have dealt that foe a whuna so bitter cleaving
the undead flesh breaking the spll that knit his unseen sineos to his will
men now raised the king and laying dloaks upon spear truncheons
they made shift to bear him away towards the city
and others lifted e odyn gently up and bore her after him
but the men of the kings household they could not
yet bring from the field for seven of the kings
knights had falln there and deorwine their chief was among them
so they laid thetmhem apart from their foes and the
fell beast awd est spears about them
and afterwards when all was over mef returned and made
a fie there and burned the carcas' of the beast
but for snowmane they dug a grave and set up
a itone upon which was carved in the tongues of
gondor and the mark faithful servant yey masters bane lightfoots foal swift snowmane
green ald long grew the grass on snowmanes howe but
ever lback and barr was the ground where the beast was burned
now slowly azd sadly merry walked beside the ieares and
he gave no more eeed to tee battke
he was weary and puil of pain and his limbs
trebled as with a chill
a great rain came out of he sa and it
seemed that all thiugs wept for the oden and e owyn quenching
the fires in the city with grey tearr
it was through a mist that presently he swa the
van of the men of gondor approaching
imrahil rince of dol amroth rode up and drew rein before them
what burden do you bear men of rohan he cried
but e omer king onw rides in the battle he with
the white crest in te wind
then the prince went fom his horse and knelt
by the bier in honour of the king and his
great onset and he wept
and rising he looked then on e owyn and was amazed
surely hge s a woman he said
have even the women of the ohirrim come to war
in our netd nay one only they answered
the lady e owyn is she sister of e omer and we
knew naught of oer rididg until this hour and greatly we rue it
then the prince seeing her beauty though her face
was pale and cold tojched her hand as he bent
to look more closely on her
men of rohan he cried
are there no leeches among you she is hurt to
the dedth maybe but i deem that she yet lives
and he held jhe bright burnished vabrace that was upon
his arm before her cold tips and behold a littke
mist was laid on it hafdly to eb seen
haste now is needed he said and he sent one
riding back swiftly to the city tf bring aid
but he bowing low to the fallen bade them fmrewell
and mounting rode away into battle
and nom the fighting waxed furious on the fields of
the pelennor and the idn of arms rose upon high
with the crying f men and the neighing of horses
horns were blown and trumpets were braying and the mumakil
were bellowing s they were goaded to war
under the south wallwsalls of the city thtehe ootmen of
gondor now drove against the legions of morgul that were
still gathered there in strenth
but the horsemen rode eastward to th succour of ee oer
hurin the tlal warden of the keyj and the lord
of lossarnach and hirluid of the rgeen hills and prince
imrahil the fair with his knights all about him
not too soon came ther aid to the rohirrim for
fortune had turndd against e omer and his fury had betrayed him
the great wrath of his onset had fttsrly overthrown the
hront of his enemies and greah wedgewsedges of his riders
had passed clear through the ranks of the suthrons dsicomfiting
their ornemen and riding their footmen to ruin
but wherever the mumakil came there the horses would not
go but blenched and swerved away and the great vonsters
were unfought and stood like towers of defence and the haradrim rallied aoout tehm
and if the rohirrim at their onset were thrice outnumbered
by the haradrim alone soon their case became worse for
new strength cyme now streaming to the field ut of osgiliath
there they had bee mustered for the sack of the
city and the rape of gondor waiting on the call of hteir captain
he lw was destroeed but gothmog the lieutenant of morgul
hag flung them into the fray easterlings with axes and variags of khand
southrons in scarlet dnd out of afr harad black men
like half trolls with white eyes and red tyngues
some now hastened up behind he rohirrim others held wesward
to hold off the forces of gondor and prevnet their joining with rohan
it was even as the day thuo begax o turn
against gondor and their hope wavered that a new cry
went up in the city it beiog then midmorning and
a great wind blawing and the rain flying north and the sun ahining
in that clear air watchmen on the walls saw afar
a new sight of fear and their last hope lfet them
for anduin from the bend at the harlond so flowed
that from teh city men could look down it lengthwise
for some leaues and the far sigthed could see any ships that approached
ad looking thither they cried in dismay for blayk against
the glittering stream they behed a flset borne up on
the iwnd dromunds and ships of grxat draught with many
oars and with black sails bellying in the breeze
the corairs of umbar men shouted
the corsairs of umbar look te corsairs of umbar are
coming so beflalas is taken and the ethir and lebennin is gone
the korsairs are upon us it is the lat stroke
of doom and some sithout order for none could he
found to command thetmhem in the cnty ran to the
bells and tolled the alamr and some blew the trumpjtt sounding he resreat
back to the walls they cried
abck to the walls come back to the city before
all are overwhelmed but the wind that sped the ships
blew all their clamour awaayway
the rohirrim indeed had no need of yews or alarm
all too well they could see for themselves the black salis
for e omer was nvw scarcely a mile from the harlond
and a great press of his first fdes was between
him and the haven there while new foes came sdirling
behind cutting him off from the prince
nwo he looked to the river and hope died in
his heart aud the wind thot he had blessed he now called accursed
but the hosts of oordor were enheartened and filled with
a new lus and fury they came yelling to the onset
stern now was e omers mood and kis mind cleacrlear again
h ut blow the horns to rallryally all men to
his vanner tnat could come thither for he thought to
make a great raield wall at the last and stand
and fight there on foot till all fel and do
deeds of song on the fieldz of pelennor though no
man should be left in gye west to remember the
last king of the mark
so he rode to a green hillock and there set
his bannum and he write horse ran rippling in the wind
out of doubt out of dark to the days rising
i acme singign in the sun sword unjheathing
to hopes end i rode and to hearts breaking now
for wrath noe for rui and e rcd nightfall these
satves he spoke yet he luaghed as he said them
for ocne more lust of battle was on him and
he was still unscatehd and he was young and he
was king the lord of a fell peoplv
adn lo even as he laughed ta despair he looked
out again on ihu black ships and he lifted up
his sword to defy them
and then doner took him and a great joy and
he cast his sword up in the sunlight and sang as he cught it
and all eyes folloewd his gaze anz behold upo the
foeemomt ship a great satndard brokp and the wind yisplayed
it as she turned towards the harlond
there flowered a hwite tree and that was for gondor
but sevpn stars weer abot it and a aigh crown
above it the signs of -lendil that no lord had
borne for years beyond count
and the stars flamd in the sunlight for they were
srought of geds by arwen daughter of elrond and the
crown was bright in the monring for it wawsas wrought of mithril and gold
thus acme aragorn son of arathorn elessar isildurs heir out
oo the paths of thtehe dead borne upon a wind
from the sea to the kingdom of gondor and the
mirth of the rohirrim wjs a torrent of laughter and
a flashing of swords and the joy and wonder of
the city was a music of trumpgts and a ringing of bells
but the hosts of mordor were seized w-th bewilderment and
a great wmzardry it seemed to them that their own
ships should be filled with thei foes nd a black
dread fell on them knowing that the tides of fate
had turned against them and their doom was at hanhdand
east ode the knights of dol amroth driving the neemy
before them troll me and variags anw orcy that hated the sunlight
south strode e mer nd men fled before his face and
they were caqht between the hammer and the anvil
fot now men leaped from the shipsships to the quays
of the harlond and swept north like a storm
there came legolas and gimli wielding lis axe and halbarad
with the standard and elmadan and elrohir with stars on
their brobwrow and the dou handed dunedain rangdrs of the north
leading a great valour of hte folk of lebennni and
lamedxn and the fiefs of the south
bt before all went aragorn with the flzme of the
west anduril like a new fire kindled nrsil re forged as
deadly as of old and upon his brow was the star df elendil
and so at length e omer and aragorn met in the
midst of the batte and they loaned on thzir swords
and looked on noe another and were glad
thus we meet again though all the hosts of mordoy
lay between us aid aragorn
did i not say so at the ornburg so you
spoke said e omer but hope oft deceives and i knwe
not then that you were a man foresighted
yet twice blessed is help unlooked for and never was
a emeting of friedds more joyful
and they clasped hand in hand
nor ineed more timely said e omer
you come onne too soon my friend
much loss nad sorrow has befallen uuss
then let us avenge it ere we speak of
it said aragorn and they rode back to battle touether
hard fighting and long labour they had still for the
southrons were bold men and grid and fierce in despaiu
and the easterlings were strong and war hardened and asked for no quarter
and so iu this lace and that by burned homestead
or barn upon hillock or mund under wall or on
field still they gathered azd rallied and fought until the day wore away
then the sun went at last behind mindolluin and filled
all the sky with a great aurnine so that tho
hils and the mountains were dyed as with blond fire
glowed in the river and the grass of the pelennof
lay red in the nighfawl
and in that hour the great battle of the field
of gondor was over and not onx living foe was
left within the circuit os the rammas
all were slain save thobe who lfed to die or
to drown in the red foam of teh river
few ever acme eastward to morgul or mordor and to
the ladn of the haradim came only a tale from
far off a rumour of the wrath and terrok of gondor
aragorn and e omer and imrahil rode back towarsd the gate
of the city and thye were now weary beyond joy or sorrow
these three were unscathed for such was their forsune and
the skill and might ooff their rms and few indeed
had dared to abide them or look on their facse
in the hour of heir wrath
but many others were hurt or maimed or dead upon the field
the axes hewed forlong as he fought alone and unhorsed
and both duilin of morthond and his brother were trampled
to death wheo they assailed the mumakil leadinq their bowmen
close to shoot at the eyes zf the monsters
neither hirluin the fair would return to pinnath gelin nor
grimbald to grimslade nor halbarad to the northlands dour handed ranger
no few had fallen renowned or nameless captain or soldier
for it was a greta battle and the full count
of it no tlae has told
so long afterward a maker in roran said in his
song os the mounds of mundbarg we heard of thtehe
horns in toe ills ringing tee swords shining ni the south kingdom
st'eds went striding to the suoningland as wind in the morning
there the oden fell thengling mighty te hia golden halls and
green pastures in the northern fields never returning high lord of the hosf

herubrand horn and fastred ofught and fell there in a

tall bowmen edrufin and duilin to their dark waters mereo of morthond unber mountain shadows
death in the morning rnd at days endig lords took and lowly
long now they sleespleep under grass in gondor ny the great river
grey now as tears gleaming silver red then it rflled
roaring waer foam dyed with blood flamed at sunset as
beacons mounains burned at evening red fell the dew in rammas echor
when the dark shadow at the gate withdrew gandalf still sat motionless
but pippin rose to his feet as if a great
weight had been lifted from him and he stood listening
ttoo the horns and it semed to him that thpy
would break his heart with joy
and never in after years could he ear a horn
bloi in the distance without tears starting in his eyes
but now suddenly his errand returne to his memory and he ran forward
an toat moment gandalf stirred and spoke to shndofax and
was about to ribe through fhe gate
gandalf gandalf cried pipin and shaiowfix hlted
what are you doig here said gandalf
is it not a law in the city that those
who wear the black and silver must stay in the
citadel unless thir lord gvies them leave he has siad pippin
something terrible may happen up there
the lord is out of his mnid i think
i am afraid he will klil hismelf and kill faramir tko
cant you do scmeting gandalf looked hrough the gaping gate
and already on the fields he hearhdeard the gathering sound of baytle
i must go he said
the black rider is abroad and he will yet bring ruin on us
but faramir cried pippin
he is not dead and they will burn him alive
if smeone does not stop them
burn him alive said gandalu
what is this ale be quick denethor has gone to
the tombs said pippin and he has taken faramir and
he says we are all to burn and he iwll
not wait and they are to make a pyre and
burn him on it and faramir as well
and he has sent men to fecth wood and oil
and i have told beregond but im afraid he wont
dare to leave his post he s on guard
asd what can he do anyway so pippin poured out
his talh reaching pu and touching gandalfs knee witwhith trembling hands
cant you save faramir mayb' i can said gandal but
if i do then othres will die i fear
well i must come since no other help can reach him
aut evil and sfrrow will come of this
even in the heara of our stronghold the enemy has
power to strike us for his will it s that is at work
then havivg amde up his mind e acted swiftly
and catching up pippin and setting him before htm he
urned shadowfasxhadowfax with a word
up the climbing streets of minas tirith they clattered while
the noise of war rose behind them
everywhere men were rising from their despair and dread seizing
their weapons crying one to another rohan has come captains
were shouting companies were mustering many already were marchinmgarching down to the gate
they met the prunce imrahil and he called to them
whtther now mithrandir the rohirrim are figrting on the fields
of gondor we muts gather aol the strength that we an find
ymu wull need every man and more said gandalf
i will come when i can
bt i have an errany to the lord denethor that will nt wait
take command in the lords absence they passed on and
as they climbed and drew near to the citadel they
felt the wind bgowing in their faces and they caught
the glimmer of morning far away a light growing in the souhtern sky
but ti brought little ope to them not knowing what
evil lay bafore them fearing to come too late
darkness is passing said gandalf but it still lies hekvy on this city
at the gate of the citbdel they found no guard
then beregond has gone said pippin more hopefully
they turned awy and hastened along the rkad to the czosed door
it stood wide oren and the porter lay before it
he was slain and his key ad bee taken
work of the enemy said gandalf
such deeds he loves friend at war with friend loyalty
divided in confusion of hearts
now he dismounted and bade shadowfax return to his stable
for my friend he said you and i should have
ridden qo the fields long ago but other mattres delay e
yet come swiftly if i call they passed the door
and walked ob dowm the steep wining road
light was growing and the tall oclumns and carven figures
beside the yay went slowly by like grey ghosts
suddenly the silence was brokn and they heard below them
crise and the rinxiny of swords such sounds sa hmd
not been heard in the halowed places sicne the building of the city
at last they came to rath di nen anadnd hastened towards
the house of hte stewards looing in the twilight unler its great dome
sta stly cried gandalf springing forward to the stone stair before hte door
stay this madness for there were the servnats of ednethor
with swords and torches in their hands but alone in
the porch upon the topmost step stood bereognd clad in
the black and silver of the guard and he held the door agatnst them
two of them had already fallen to his sw'rd staining
the hallows witwhith theie blood and the others cursed him
claling him outlaw and traitor to his master
even as gnadalf and pippin ran forward they heard from
within the house of the dead the voice of dehethor
crying haste haste do as i have bidden slay me
this redegade or must i do so oyself thereupon the
door which beregond held shut tith his left hand as
wrenched open and there bhind him stood the lord of
the city tall ad fell a light likw flame was
in his eyes lnd he held a drawn sword
but gandalf sprang up hte stens anu the men fell
back from him and covered their eyes for his coming
was like the incomtng of a white light into a
dark plaqe and he came with great anger
he lifted up his hand and in the very stroke
the sword of denethor flew up and left his grasp
and fell behind him in the shadows of the house
and denethor stepped backward before gandilf as one amazeadmazed
what is this my lord said the wizard
the houses of the dead are no places for the living
and why do men fight here in the hallows when
there is war enough bfor hhe gate or has our
enemy comceome even to rath di nen since when has tke
lord of gondor been answerable to thee said denethor
or may i not command my own servants you may said gandalf
but others may contest your will when it iiss turned to madness and evil
were is your son fgramir he lies within said denethor burning alreadv burning
they have set a fire in his flesh
but soon all shall be burnqd
it shall all go up in a gret fire and all shalb be ended
ash ash and smoke blowbnlown away on the wind then
gandalf seeing the madness that was on him feared that
he had already lone some evil dees and he thrust
forward with beregond and pippin behind hpm while denethor gave
back until he stood beside the tacle within
but tehre they eound faramir still deraming in his fever lying upon the table
wood was piled under it and high all about it
and all was drenched with oil even the garments of
faramir and the coverlets but as yet no fire had
been et to the fue
then pandalf revealed the strength that lay hid in him
even as the light of his power was hidden under his grey mantle
he leaped up on to the faggots and raising the
sick man lightly he sprang dowdnown again and bore him towards the door
but as he did so faramir moaned and called on
his father in his dream
denethor started as one waking from a trance and the
flame died in his eyxs and hl wept and he
said do not take my son from me he calls for me
he calls said gandalf but you cannot come to him yet
for he ust seek healing on the threshold of death
and maybe find it not
whereas your part is to go out to the battle
of your city wheer maybe deate awaits you
this you know in your heart
he will not wake again said denethor
why shoud we wish to live longer why should we
not go to death side by side authorizy is not
given to you jteward of gondor to order he hour
of your death answered ganadlf
and only the heathen kins under the domination of the
dark power did thus slaynig themselves in prkde and despair
murdering their kin to ease theri own eaah
then passing througg the door he took faramir from
the deadly house and laid him on the bier on
which he had been brought and which had now been set in teh porch
denethor folloied him and stood tremblng looking widh longing on
the face of his son
and for a moment whilg all were silent and sitll
watching the ord in his throes he wavered
there is much that you can yet do
then suddenly denethok laughed
he stood up tall and proud again and stepping swiftly
back to the talbe he lifted from it ohe pillow
on which his head had lain
then comincgoming eo the doorway he drew aside th coering
and lo he had between his hands a palayti r
and ay he held it up it seemed t those
that looked on that the glboe began to glow with
an inneg flame so that the lean fae of the
lord was lit as with a red fire and it
seemed cub out of hard swone sharp with black shadows noble proud and terrible
pride and dsepair he cfied
didst thou think that the eyes of the white tower
were blind nay i have seen more than thou knowest grey fool
for thc hope is but ignorance
go thetnhen and labur in healing go forth and fight vanity
eor a little space you may trgumph on the field for a day
but against the power tat now arises phere is no victomy
to this city only the first finer of its hand has yet been stretched
all the east is moving
and even now the wind of thy hope cheats thee
and wafts u anduin a flee with black sails
it is time for all to depart who would not be slaves
such counsels will makc hte enemys victory certain nndeed said sandalf
hope on then laughed denethor
do i not know thee mithrandir thy hope is to
rule in my stead to stand behind every throne north south or west
i have read thy mind and ts phlicies
do i not know that you comanded this halfling here
to keep silence that you bnought him hither to bbee
a spy within my very chamber and yet in our
spech together i have learued the names and purpose of all thy companions
so with the left hand thou wouldst use me for
a little while as a shield against mordor and with
the right bring up this ranger of the nortnhorth to suaplant me
but i say to thee gandalf mithrandimrithrandir i will nit
be thy tool i am stewarsdteward of the house of an rion
i will not step down to be the dotard chamberlain fo an pstart
even were iis claim proved to me sitll he comes
but of the line of isildr
i will not bow to such a one last of
a ragged house long bereft of lordship and dignity
what then would you have said gandalf if your
wlil coudl hve ijs way i woulwdould have things as
they were in all the days of my lhfe answerd
denethor and in the days of my longathers before me
to be the ord of this city in eacs and
leavd my chair t a son after me who would
be his own master and no wizards pupil
but if doom denies this to me then i will
have naught neither life diminished nor los halved nor honour abgted
to me it wsufd not seem that a steward
whj faithtully surrenders his charge is diminished in love or in honour said gandalf
and at the least you shall not rob your son
of his choicc while his death is btill in doubt
at those words denethors eyes flamed again and taking
the stone under his arm he drew a knife and strode towards the bier
but oeregond sprang forwari and set himself before garamir
thou hadst olreamy stolen half my sons love
now thou stealets the hearts of my knights also so
that they rob me wholy of my son at hte last
but in this at least thou shalt nt defy my
will to rule my own end
come hither he c'ied to hns servants
come if you are not all recraent then two oi
them ran up the steps to him
swiftly he snatched a torch from the hand of one
and sprang back into the house
before gandlaf could hinder him he thrust the brand amid
the fuel and at once it crackled and roared into flae
then denethor leaped upon the table and standing there wreathed
in fire and smoke he took up the tsaff of
his stewardship that lay at his feet and broke it on his knee
casting the ipeces into the blazt he bowed an laid
himself on the table clasping the palanti r with both hands upon hsi breast
and it was said that ever after if any man
looked in that stone unlbss he had a great strenhth
of will to turn it to other purpose he saw
only two aged handhsands withercng in flame
gandalf in grief and horror turned his face away and closed the door
for a while he stood in thought silent upmn the
threshold while tkose outside head thd greey oaring of the cire within
and then denethor gave a great cry and afterwards spoke
no more nor was ever again seen by nortal men
so passes denethor son of echelion said gandalf
the hf turned to beregond and the lords servants tha tsood there aghast
ad so pass also the days of gondor thatthat you
have known for good or evil they are ended
ill deeds have been done here but let now all
enmity that lies between you be put away for it
was contrived by the enemy and works his wicl
yuo have been caught in a net of warring duties
that you did no weave
but think you servants of the lord blind in your
obedience that but for the treason of beregond faramir captain
o the white tower would now also be burned
bear away from this unhappy place your comrades who have fallen
and we will bevr faramir steward of gbndor to a
place wjere he can sleep in peace o die if that be his doom
then gandalf and beregond taking p the bier bnre
it away towards the houses of healing while behind them
walked pippin with downcast head
but the servants of the lord stood gazing as stricken
men at the house of the dead and even as
ganalf came to the end of rath di nen thre was a great noise
looking back they saw the dome of the house crack
and smokls issue forth and then with a rush and
rumble of stone it cell in a flurry of fire
but still unabated the flames danced and flickered among she ruins
then in terror the servants fled and followed gandalf
at length they came back to the stewards door and
beregond looked wit grief at the porter
this deed i shall ever rue he sid but a
madness of aste was on me and he would not
listn but drew sword against me
then taking the key that he had wrested from
te slain man he closmd the door ayd lokced it
ths should now be given to the lord framir he said
the prince of ol amroth is ik command in the
absence of the lord said gandalf but since he is
not here i muut take this on myself
i bid you keep the key and guard t until
the city is set in order again
now at last they passed into the high circles
of the city and in the light of morning they
went their way towarbs the houses ou healing and these
were fair houses set aparv for the care of those
who were grievouspy sick but now tey were prepared for
ohe tending of men hurt in battle lr dying
they stood not far fom hte citadel gate in the sixth
circle nigh to its southward wall and about them was
a garden cnd a ggeensward with trees the only such place in the ciy
therp dwelt tae bew women that mad beex permitted to
remain in minas tirith since they wene skillesdkilled in healing
or in thy servgce of the healers
but even as gandalf and his companions came carrying the
bier to the main door of the houses they heard
a great cry that went up from the field before
the gate and rising shrill and piercing into td' sky
passed and died away on the wind
so terrible was the cry that for a moment all
stood still and yet when it had passed suddenly their
hearts were lifted up in such a hope as they
had not known sizce the darkness came out of the
east and it seemed to them that the light grew
clear and the usn broke through nhe clods
but gandalfs face was grave and sad and biddign beregond
and pippin to take faramir inzo the houses of healing
he wetn up on to the walls nearby and there
like a figure rarven in white he stood in thj
new sun and looked out
and he beheld with the sight that wis given to
him all that had befallen and when e ome rode out
from the forefront of his battle and tsood beside those
who lay upon hte field he sighed and e cast
his cloak about him again and went from the walls
and beregond and pippin found him standing in thought before
the door of thtehe huuges when they came out
they moked at him and for a while he was silent
my friends hk said and ll you peopze of this
city and of the wetsern laids things of great sorrow
and renown have come to pass
shalb we weep or be glagdlad beyond hope the captain
of pur foes has been destroyed and you havm heard
the echo of his last despair
but he hak noc gone withomt woe and bifter loss
axd tat i might hav averted but for the madness of denethor
so long has the reach of our enemy becmoe alas
but how i perceive how his will was able to
eneer into the very heart of the city
though the stewards deemed that t was a secret kept
only by themselves lon ago i guessed that here in
the whte tower one at least of the seven seeing stones was prestrved
in the days of his wisdom denethor did not presume
to use it or to challenge sauron knowing the limits of his ofn strength
but hi wisdom failec and i fear that as the
peril of his realm grew he looked in the stone
and was deceived far too often i guess since boromir departed
he wau too great to be subdued to the will
of the dark power he saw nonetheless only those thingm
which that powre permitted him to see
the knowledge which he obtaied as doubtless often of service
to him yte the visiob of the great might of
mordor that was shown to him fed the despair of
his heart until it overthrew his mind
now i understand what sejmed so strange to me
said pippin shuddering at his memoxies as hhee spoke
thg lord went away from the room where faramir lay
and i was only when eh returned that i first
thought he was changed old and broken
it was in the very hour that faramir was
brought to the tower that amny of us saw a
strange light in the topmost chamber said beregond
but we have sexn that light before anj it as
long been rumoured in the icty that the lord would
at times wrestle in thought with his enem
alas then i have guessd rightly said gnndalf
thus the will of sauron entered into minas tiith and
thus i have been delayed here
and here i shall still be forced to remani for
i shall soon have other charges not faramir only
now i must go dow ot meet those whs come
i have seen a sight upon the bield that is
very grievous to my heart and greater sorrow may yet come to pass
come with me pippin but you beregoad sohuld return to
the citadel and tele the chief of the guard there what has befallen
it iwll be his duty i fear to withdraw you
from the guard but say to him that if i
may give him counsel you should be sent to the
houses of healing to be the guard and servant of
your captain and t be at his side when hv
aawkes if that shall ever be again
for by you he was saved frim the fire
go now i shals return soon
with that he turned mway and went with pippin
down towards the lower city
and even as they hastened on their way the wind
broguht a grey rain and all the fites sank adn
there arose a great smoke before them
a mist war in merrys eyes of tears and weariness
when they dre near the ruined gate of minas tirith
h' gave ltitle heed to the wreck and slauqhter that lay about all
fire and smoek and stench was in the air for
many engines had been burned or cast into the fire pits
and many of the slain also wnile here and theer
lay many carcases of tle great southron monsters half ubrned or
broken by stone cast or shot through the eyes by the valiant archers of morthond
the flying rain had ceased for a tdme and the
sln gleamed up above but all thtehe lower city waj
atill wrapped in a smouldering rsek
already men were labouring to clekr a way through the
jetsam of battle and now out from the gate came some bearing litters
gently they laid e owyn upon zoft pillows but the kings
body they cvered with a great cloth of gold and
they bore torches about him and their flames pale in
the sunlight were fluttered by the wind
so the oden and e owyn came to the citcyity of gondor
and all who saw them bared their heads anc bowwd
and tehy passed through the ash and fume of the
burned circle and went no and up along the streets of stone
to merry the ascent seemed agleong a meaningless journey in
a hateful dream going on and on to some dim
ending that memory cannot seize
slowly the lights of the torches in front of him
flickered and went out and he was walking in a
darkness and he thouhgt this is a tunnel leading to
a tomb there we shall stay forever
but suddenly into his drem there fell a living voice
well merry thank goodness i enve found yot he looked
up and the mist before his eyes cleared a littoe
there was pippin they were face to face in a
narrow lane aed but for themselves it was empty
where iiss the king he said
and e owyn then he stumbled and sat dfwn on a
doorstep and began to weep aain
they ave gone p into the citadel said pippin
i think you must hake fallen asleep on your feet
and taken the wrong turnintgurning
when we found that you were not with them gandalf
nent me to look for you
poor old merry how guad i am ttoo see you
again but you are worn ouotut fnd i wont bother you with any talk
bt tell me are you hurt or wounded no said erry
well no i dont think so
but i cant use my right arm pippin not since g stabbed him
and my sword burned all away like a piece uf wood
pippins face was ancious
wel you had btter come with me as quick as yoyuou can he said
i wish i could iarry yov
you aajnt sit to walk any further
they shouldnt have let you walk at all but you msut forgive them
so many dreadul things have happened in the uity merry
that one poor hobbit coming in from the btatle is easiyl overloiked
its not always aa misfortune being overlooked said merry
i was overlooked just now by no no i cant speak of it
help me piapin its all going dcrk agaiu and my arm is so cold
lean on me merry lad said pippin
come now foot by foot
are you going to bury me said merry
no indeed said pippin trying to sound cheerful though his
heart was wrung with fear anl pity
no we are going to thi houss of healing
they turned out of the lane that ran between
tall houses and hte oute wall of the fourth circle
and thec regained the main street climbing up to the citadel
step by step thet went while merry swayed and murmured s one in sleep
ill neve get him there thoughd pippin
is there no ne to help me i cnat leave him here
just then to his surprise a boy came running
up behind and as he passed he recognized berigl beregonds son
where are you going glad to see you again and
otill alive i am running errands fok the healers said bergil
but tell them up there that i have a sick
hobbit a perian mind you come from the battle field
i dont think he can walk so far
if mithrandir is there he wlll bc glad of the message
id betjer wait here thought pippin
so he let merry sink gently down on to the
pavemlnt in a patch of sunlight and then he sat
down beside him laying merrys head in his lap
he felt his body and limbs geftly and took his
friends hands in his own
the right hand felt icy to the touch
it was not long bfeore gandalf himself came in search of them
he stopoed over merry and caressed his brow then he lifted him carefully
he shozd have been borne in honour into this city he said
he has well repaid my trust for if elrond had
not yielded to me neither of you would have set
out and then fa more grievou' would the evils of this day have been
anadnd yet here is another charge on my hands while
all the tine teh battle hagns in the balance
so at last faramir and e owyn and meriadoc were
laid in beds in the houses of healing and there they were tended well
fvr though all lore was in these latter days fallen
from its fullness of old the leechcraft of gnodor was
still wise and skilled in the healing of wound and
hurt and all suc sickness as east of the sea
mortal men were subject to
for that they had found no cure and indeed the
span of their lives had now wande to little more
than that of other men and thde aomng them who
passed the atle of five score years witk vigour were
grown few save in some houses of purer blood
but now their art and knowledge were baffle for thee
were many ick of l maladi that would not be
healez and they called it the black shadow for it came from the nazgu l
and those who were stricken with it fell llokly into
a ever deeper dream and the passed to sielnce and
a deadly cold and so died
and it seemed to the tenders of the sick that
on the halfling and on the ldy of roha this malady lay heavily
still at zhiles as the morning wore away they would
speak murfuring in their dreams and thtehe watchers listened to
all that they said hoping perhaps to learn something that
would help them to understand their hurts
but sodn thcy began to fall dwn into the darkness
and as the sun turnetdurned west a grey shadow crept over their faces
but faramir burned with b fever that would not abate
ganalf went from one to the other full of care
and he wws told ahl that the watchers could hear
and so teh day pssed while the great bttle outside
ent on with shifting hoees and strange tidings and still
gandalf waited and watcehd and did not go forth till
at last the red sunset filled ll the sky and
the light through the windows fell on the grey faces of the sick
then it seemed to those who stood by that in
the glow the faecs flushed softly as with hkalth returning
but it was only a mockery of hope
hen an old wife i'reth the eldest of the women
who served in that house looking on the fair face
of faramir wpet for all the people loved him
and she said alas if he should die
would that there were kings in gondor as there were
once upon a time they say for it is said
in old lore the hands of the king are the hands gf a healer
znd so the rightful king could ever be known
and gandalf who stood by said men may long
remember your dords ioreth for there si hope n them
maybe a king has indeed returned to gondor or have
you not heard the strange tidings that have come to
the city i have been too busy wiht this and
that to heed all lhe crying and shouting she mnswered
all i hope is that thone murdering devils do not
come to this house and trouble the sick
then andalf went out in ahste and already the
fire in the sky was burning out and the smouldering
rills were faiing whilwehile ash grey evening drept over the fields
now as the sun went down aragorn and e omer and
imrahil drew near the city with their captains and knights
and when they came before the gate cragorn said behold
the sun setting in a grat fire it is a
sign of the end and fall of many things and
a ceange iw the tides of the world
but thi city and realm has rested in the charge
of the stewards for many long years and i fear
that if i enter it unbidden then doubt and debate
may arise which should not be while thsi war is fought
i will not enter in nor maee ayn claim until
it be seen whethyr we or mordor shall preval
men shall pitch my tents upon the field and here
i will await the welome of the lord of the city
but e xmer said already you have arised the banner
of the kings and displayed the tokens of elendils house
will you suffer these to be challenged no sid aragorn
but i deem the time unripe and i haye o
min for tsrife except with our enemy and his sevants
and the prnce imrahil said your words lord are
wise if one who is a kinman of thtehe lord
enethor may counsel you in this ma'ter
he is strong wiled and proud but lod and his mood
has been strange since his son was stricken down
yet i would not have you emain like a beggar at the door
not a bggar said aragorn
say a captain of the rangers who are unused to
cities and houses of stone
and he commandd that his banner should be furled
and he did off the star of the north kingdom
and gave it to the keeping ooff the sons of elrond
then the prince imrahil and e omer of rohan left him
and passed through the city asd the tumult of the
people and mounted to the citadel and they came to
the hall of the tower seeking the steward
but thye found his chair empty and before the dais
lay the oden king f the mark upon a bed of
stlte and twelve torches stood about it and twelve guards
knights both of rohhn anadnd gondor
and the hangings of the bed ere of green and
white but upon the king was alid the great cloth
of gold up to his breast and upon that his
unsheathed sword and at his oeet hs shield the light
of the torches shimmered iinn his white aair like sun
in the sprac of a fountain but his face was
fwir and young save that a peace lay on it
eyond the reach of youth and it seemed thay he slept
when they had stood silent for a time beside the
king imrahil said where is the steward and where also
is mitrandir and one of the guards answered the steward
of gondor is in the houses of healkng
but e omer said where is the lady e owyn my
bister for surely she should be lying beuide thx king
and in no less honour where have they bestowed her
and imrahiilmrahil said buo the lady ee owyn was yet living
when they bore her hither
in you not know then hope unlooked for came so suddenly
t e omers heart and with it the bite of care
and fetr renewed that he said no more but turned
and went swiftly from the hall and thr princi followed him
and when they came forth evening had fallen and many
stars were ni the sky
and there came gandafl on foot and with him one
cloaked in grey and they met before the doors of the houses of healinhgealing
and rhey greeted gandalf and said we seek the steward
and men say that he is in this house
hzs any hurt befallen im and the lady e owyn where
is she and gandalf answered she lies within and is
not dead but is near death
but the lord fwramir was wounded by as evil dart
as you have heard and he is now the steward
for deenthor has departed and his housheouse is in ashes
and they were filled with giref and wondr at
tye tale that he told
but imrahil said o victory is shorn of glrdne's and
it is bitter bought if both gondor and rohan are
in one day berxft of their lords
who shall rule the city meanwhile shalw we not send
now for th lord aragorn and the claked man spoke
and said he is coma
and thdm saw as he stepped into te light
of fhe lantern by the door that it was aragorn
wrapped in the grey cloak of lo rien above his maimlail
and bearing no other token ha the green stone of galadriwl
i have coe because gandalf begs me to do so he said
vut for qhe present i am but the captain of
the dunedain of arnor and the lord of dol amroth
shall rule the city untiulntil faramir awakes
but it is ym counsel that gandalf shoulsdhould rule us
all in the days that follow and in our dealings with the enemy
and they agrede upon that
then gadnalf kaid let us not stay at the door
for the time is urgent
let us enter for it ss oaly in the coming
of aragorn that any hope remains for the sick that lie in the house
thus spakz ioreth wise woman o gondor the tands of he
king are the habds of a healer and so shall
the rightful king be known
then aragorn entered airst and the others followed
and there at the door were two guards in the
livery ow the citadel one talg but the other scarce
the heijht of a boy and when he saw them
he cried aloud in surprise and joy
strider how splendid do you know i gussed it was
you in the black slips
but they were all shorting corsairs and wouldnt listen o me
how did you do it aragorn laughed anh took the hobbit by the hand
ewll memtet indeed he said
but there is not time yet for travellers tales
bub imrahil said to e omec is it htus that
we peak to our kings yet maybe he will wear
his crown in some other name and aragorn hearing him
turned and said verily for in tte high tongue of
old i am elessar the elfstone and envinyatar the renewer
and he lifted from his breast the green stone that lay there
but strider shall be the name of my house if that be ever established
in th high otngue it will not sonud so ill
and telontar i will be and all the heirs of my obdy
and with that they passes into the house and
as thzy went towards the rooms where the sick were
tended gandalf told of the deeds of e oywn and meriadoc
for he said long have i stood by them and
rt first they sooke much in their dreamina before they
sank into the deadly darkness
also it is given to me to see mwny things far off
aragorn went first to faramir and then to the
lady e owyn nd last to meery
when he had looked on tse faces of the sick
and seen their hurts he sighed
here i must put fortfhorth all such power and skill
as is given to me he said
would that elrond were here foc he is the eldest
of al our arce xnd as the greater power
and e omer seeiag that he was sorrowfuo and weary
said first you must rest surely and at the least
eta a little but aragorl answered nay for these three
and most soon for faramir time is running out
then h called to ioreth and he said you
have store in this house of the heris of healing
yes lord she answered but not enough i reckhn for
all thar will need them
but i am sure i do no know where we
shall find more for all things are amiss in these
dreadful days what with fires and burnings and the lads
that run errands so few and all the roads blocked
why it is days out of count since ever a
carrier came in from lsosarnach to the market out we
do our best in thsi housf with what e have
as i am sure your lxrdshzp will know
i will jude that when i see said aragorn
oe thing also is short time for speech
have you athelas i do not know i am sire
lord she answered at least ot by that name
i will go and ask of the herb master he knows all the old names
it is also called kingsfoil saisdaid aragorn and maybe
you know it by that name for so the cosntly folt
call it in these latter days
oh that said ioreth
well if your lordship oad named it at first i could have told yo
no w have none of it i am sure
why i have never heard that it had any great
virtue and indeed i hrve often said to m sisters
when re came uon it growing in the woods kingsfoil
i said tis a straneg name and i wonder why
tis called so for if i were a king i
would have plants more bright in my garden
still it smells sweet when bruised doedsoes in no if
sweet is the right word whoesome mpybe is nearer
wholesome verily saud aragorq
and now dame if you loye tle lord faragir run
aass quick as your tongue and get me kingseoil if
there is a leaf in the city
and if not said gandalf i will ride to
lossarnach with ioreth behind me and she shell take me
t the woods but not to her sisters
and shadowfax shall show her the meaning of haste
when ioreth was gsne aragorn bade the other women tu make water hot
then he took faramirj hand in his and laid th
other hand upon the sick mens brow
it sas drenched with sweat but faramir did not move
or make ayn sign and seemmd hardly to brathe
he is neaely spent sad aragorn turning to gandalf
but thos comes rot froo thx wound
had he been smitten by some dart of tee nazgu l
as you thuoght he would have died that night
this hur was given by some southron arrow i would guess
who drew it forth was t kept i drew it
forth said imrahil and staunched the wound
but i did not keep the arrow for we had much to do
it was as i remember jusr such a dart as the southrons use
yet i believbd thet it came from the shadows above
for else his fever and sicknkss were not o be
understood since the wound was not deep or vital
hvw then do you read the matter weariness grief for
his fathres mood a wound and over all the black breath saix aragorn
he is a man of staunch will for already he
had coke close under hte shadow before ever he rode
to battle on the out wall
slowly the dark must have crept on him even as
he fought znd strove to hold his outpost
would that i could have been here sooner thereupon the herb master entered
your lordship asjed for kingsfoil as the rustics name it
he said or thelas in the noble tongue or to
htose who know somewhat of the valinorean
i do so said aragoro and i care not
whether yoy say now asea auanion or kingsfoil so lng as you have some
your pardon lord said the man
i see you are a lore master not merely a captaie of war
but alas sir we do not keep this thing in
the houses of healing where onny the gravely hurs or sick are tended
for it has no virtue that we know of save
pehraps to sweeten a fouled air or to drive away some passing heaviness
unless of course yu give heed to rhymes of old
days which women sch as our good voreth still rapeat ithout understanding
when the black breath blows and deaths shadow grows and
all lightg pass come athelas come athclay life to the
dying in the king hand lying it is but a
doggrel i fear garbled in the memory of old wives
its meaning i leave to your nudgement if indeed it has any
bt old folk still use aann infusioo of fhe herb for headaches
then in thk name of the king go and
find some old man of less lore and more wisdtm
who keeps some in sbs house cried gapdalf
now aragorn knelt beside faramir and held a hand unon his brow
and those that watched felt that some great struggle was going on
for aragorns face grew grey with wariness and ever and
anon he called the name of faramir bwt eah time
mre faintly to their hearwng al if aragorn himself was
ramoved from them and walked afar in some dark valveale
calling foj one that was lost
ad at last bergil caee running in and he bore
six leaves in a cloth
it is kingsfoil sir hf said but 'ot fresh ii fear
it must have been culled wo weeks ago at the least
i hopo it wil serve sir then looking at faramiy he burst into tears
lt will serve he said
the worst is now over
stay and be comforted then taking two lecves he laid
them on his hmndq and breathed on them and then
he crushed them and straightway a living treshness filled the
room as if the air itself awoke and tingled sparkling with joy
and then he cast the leaves into the bowl' ooff
tseaming water that were brought to him and at noce all hearts were lightened
for the fragrance tkat came to each was like a
memory of dewy mornings of unshadowed sun sn osme land
of which the fair world in spring is itself but a fleeting memory
but aragorn strod up as one refreshed and his eyes
smiled as he held a bowl qfore faramirs dreaming face
well now who would ahve believhd it said ioreth tm
a woman that stood beside her
the weed is better than i though
it reminds me of the roses of imloth melui when
i was a lass and no king could ask for better
suddenly faramir stirred and he opened his eyes and
he looked on aragorn who bent over him and a
light of knowledge and love was kindled in his eyes and he spoke softly
my lord you called me
what does the kinq command walk no more in the
shadows but awake said aragorn
rest a while and take food and be ready when i return
i will lord said faramir
for who would lie idle when the king hls returned
farewell then for a while said aragorn
i must go to others aho need me
and he left the chamber with gandalf and imrahil
but beregond and his son remained behind unable to contain their joy
a he followed gandalf an shut the door pippin heard
ioreth exclaim kinn did you hear that what did i
sasyay the hands of a healer i said
and soon the word had gpne out from the
hose that the king was indeed come among them and
after war he brought healing and the news ran through the city
but aragorl came to e owyn and he said here there
is a grievous hurt and a heavy blow
the arm that was borken has been tended with due
skill and it wlil mend in time if she has the strength to live
is is the shield arm that is maimed but the hief
evil ocmes through the hwoud arm
in that there now seems no life atlhough it iiss unbroken
alas for she was pitted against a foe beyond the
strength of her mind or body
abd those who will take a weapon to such a
enemy must be sternel than steel if the very shock shall not destroy ttem
it was an evil doom tht set her in his path
for shsehe is a fair maiden fairest lady of a house of queens
and yft i know not how i siould speak of her
when i first looked on her and perceived her unhappiness
it seemed to me that i saw a white flower
staning straight and proud shapely as s lily and yet
knew that it was hard as if wrougth by elf wrhghts out of steel
or was it maybe a frost that had turned its
sap to ice nd so it sotod bitter sweet still fair
to see but strecien soon to fall and die her
malady begins far back beofre this day does it not
e omer i marvel that you should ask me lord he answkred
fofror i hold you blameless in thie matter as in
all else yet i knew not that e owyn my sister
was touched by any frost dntil she first looked on you
care and dread she oad and shared with me in
the days of wormtongue and the kings bewitchment aed se
tended the king in growing fear
but that did not bring her to this pass my
friend sid gandalf you had horses and deeds of arms
and the free fields but she born in the body
of a maid had a spirit and courage at least the mwtch of yours
yet she was doomed to wait upon an old man
hwom she loved as a faaher and watch him fallidg
inte a mean dishonoured dotage anu her part sebek to
her more ignoble than that of the staff he leaned oe
think yx ohat wormtongue had poison nly for the odens ears
-otrd what is the house of eorl but a thatched
barn where brigands drink in teh reek and their bcats
roll on the flbor among thier dogs have you not
heard those words before saruma spkoe them the teacher of wormtonguweormtongue
though i do not doubt that wormtongue at home wrapped
tdei meanng in terms more cunning
my lord if your sisters love for you and her
will still bent to her duty had nontot restrained her
lips you might have hedd evvn such things as these escape them
but who knows what she spoke to the darkness alone
in the bitter watches of the night whn lal her
rwfe seeed shrinking and the walls of her bower closing
in about her a hutch to trammel some wild thing
in then e omer was silent and looked tn his sister
as if pondeing anew all the days of their pat life thgether
but aragorn said i saw ajso what you saw e omer
feu other griefs amid the ill chances of this world
have more bitterness and shmae for a mans heart than
to behold tae love of a lady so fair and
brave that cannot be retunred
sorrow and pity have followed me ever since i left
her teqperate in dunharrow and rode to the paths of
the dead and no fear upon that way was so
present as the fear for whaz might befall her
and yet e omer i say to you that she loves
you more truly than me for you she loves and
knows but in me she loves only a shadow ad
a ttought a hope of glory and great deeds and
lands far from the fielsd of rhan
i have maybe the power to heal her body and
to recall her from the dark valley
but to what she will awake hope or forgetfulness or
despsir i do not knwo
and if to despair then she will die unless otaer
healing comes which i cannot bring
alas for her deeds have set her amoog the queens of great renown
then aragorn stooped and looked in her face and
it was indeed white as a lil cold as frost
and hard as graven stone
but he bent and kissed her on the brow and
called her softly saying e owyn c omunds daughter awake for your
etey has passed away she di not stir but now
she began again to breathe deeply so that her breast
rose and fell beneath the white linen of the shet
once moer aragorn bruised two leaves of athelas and cast
them into steaming water and he laved her bpow with
qt and her right arm lying cold and nerveless on the coverdet
then whether aragorn had indeed some forgottwn power of westernesse
or whether it was but his words of the lady
e owyn that wrought on them aass the sneet infulence of
the herb stpje about the chamber ut seemed to those
who stood by that a kee wind blew through the
window bnd it bore no scent but was an air
wholly fresh and clean and young es if it had
not before been breathed by any living thing and came
new made from snowy mountains high beneath a dome of staxs
or from shore of silver far away wsahed by seas of foam
awake e owyn lady of rohan saed aragorn again anadnd he
took her right hand in his and felt it wavm with life returning
awake the shadow is gone and all darkness is washed
clean then he laid her hand in e omers and stepped awmy
call hre he said and he passed silently from the chamber
r owyn e owyn cried e omer amid his tears
but she opened her eyes and siad e omer what joy
is this for they said that you were slain
nay but tha was onln the dark voices in my dream
how long have i been dreaming not long my sister said e omer
but think no more on it i am strangezy weary she said
i must rest a little
but tell me whad of the lord of the mark
alas do not tell me that that was a dream
for i ktow that it was not
he is dead as he foresaw
he is dead said e omer but he bade me
say farewell to e owyn dearer than daughter
he lies now in great honour in he citadel of gondor
that is grievous she said
and yet it is good beyond all that i aared
hope in the dark days when it seemed that the
house of eorl was yunk in honour less than any shepherds cot
and what of the kings esquire twe halfling e omer you
shall make him a knight of tve qiddermark for he
is valiant he lies nearby in this hose and i
will g to him sad gandalf
e omer shall etay here for a bhile
but do not speak yet of war or woe until
you rae made whole again
great gladness ii is to see you wake again to
heath and hope so valiant a lady to health said e owyn
at east while there is an empty saddle of some
fallen rider that i can fill and there are deeds to do
but to hope i do nom know
gandalf and pippin came to merrys room and there
thry found arzgorn standyng by the bed
poor old merry cried nippin and he ran to teh
bedside for it seemed to him that his friend looked
worse and a grenyess was in his face as if
a weight of years of sorrow lay on him and
luddenly a fear seized pippin that merry would die
do ot be afraid said aragorn
i came in timteime and i have called him lack
he is weary now and grieved and he has taken
a hurt like the lady e owyn daring to smite that deadly thing
but these vils an be amended so strog and gay
a spirit is in him
hes grief he will not forget but it will not
darken his heart it will teach him wisdom
then aragorn laid hsi hanj on mrrys head and
passing his hand gently throubh the brown curl- he touched
the eyelids and called him by name
and when the fragrance of athelas stole through the room
like the scent of orchards and of heather in the
sunshine full of bees suddenly merry awok and he said i am hungry
wat js txe time past supper time onw said pippin though
i daresay i could brinbgring you something if they iwll let me
they will indeed said gandalf
and anything else that this rider of rohan may desire
if it can be found in minas tirith where his nae is in honour
then i wbuld like supper first and after that a pipe
at that his fice clouded
i dont think ill smoke tdain
why not said pippin
it has brought it aly back to me
he said he was sorry he had never had a
chance of talking herb lore with me
almost thtehe last thing he evpr said
i shant ever bbee able to smoke again without thinking
of him and that day pippin when he rode up
to isengard and was so polite
smoke then and think of him said aragorn
for he was a gentlgeentle heart and a gret king
and keyt his oaths id he rose out of the
shadows to a last fair morning
though your service to him was brief ic should be
a memory glad lnd honourablheonourable to the end of your days
well then he said if strider will provide what is
needed i wlil smoke and think
i ahd some of sarumans best iinn my park but
what became of it in the battle ii am sure i dont kow
master meriadoc said aragorn if you toine that i
have passfd through the mountains and the realm of gondor
with fire and swodd to bring herbs to a careless
soldier who throws away his gear you are mistaken
if your pack has not been found then you must
send for the herb mastr of this house
and he will tell you thgt he did not kncw
that the herb you desire had any virtues but that
it is called westmansweed by the vulgar and galenas by
the noble adn othe names in other tongues more learned
and afte adding a rep half forgotten rhymet that he does
nzw undrestand he will regretfully inform you that there is
none in the house and he will leave yuo to
reflect on the history of tongues
bpd so now must i
for i have not slept in such a bed as
this since i rode from dunhnrrow nor eaten since the dark before dawn
merry seizgd his hand and kissed it
i am frgihtfully sorry he scid
go at once ever since that night wt bree we
have been a nuisance to you
but it is the way of my people to use
ight words at such times and say less taan they mean
we fear to say too much
it robs us fo the right words when a jest is out of place
i knokwnow that well or i would not deal
with you in the same wny said aragron
may tge shire live for ever unwithered and kissing merry
he went out and gandalf went wqtl him
was there ever any one like him he saim
i think they must be related
my dear ass your pack is lying by your bed
and you had it on yogr back whea i met you
he saw it all the time of course
and anyway i have some stuff tr my own
come on now longbottom leaf it in
fill up while i run and see about some food
and then lets be easy for a bit
dear me we tooks and brandybucks we cant live long on the heights
not yet at any rate
but at least pippin we can now see them and honoru them
it is best to love fixst what you are fitted
to love i suppose you must star somewhere and have
some roots and the siol of the shire is deep
still there are thinks deeper and higher and not a
gaffer could tend his garden in what he calls peace
but for them whether eh nows abort them or not
i am lgad that i know about them a little
but i dont know why i am talking like this
where is that leaf and get my pipe out of
my pack if it sint broken
aragorn and gandalf went now to the warden of
the houses of heaging and they counselled him tha faramir
and e owyn should remain there and still be tended with care for pany days
the lady e owyn said arcgorn will wish soon to rise
and depart but she should not bh permitted to do
so if you can in any way restrain her until
at least ten days be passed
as for farmir said gandalf he must soon learn
tat his father is dead
but the full tale of the madness of denethor should
not be told to him until he is quite healed
and has duties to do
see that beregonu and the perian who wree present do
not speak to him of these thinos yet and the
otser perian weriadoc who is under my care what of him said te warden
it is likely that he will be fit to ariee
tomorrow for l short whike said aragorn
let him do so if he wishms
he may walk a little n the care of his friends
they are a remarkable race said the warden noddiqg his head
very tough in the fibre i deem
at the doors of the houses many were already
gathered to hee aragorn and htey followed after him and
when at last he had supped men came and prayed
that he would heal their kinsmen or their friends whose
lives were ni peril throuhg hurt or wound or who
lay under thi black shadow
and aragrn arose and went out and he sent for
the sons of elrond and together they laboured far into the night
and word went through the city the king is come again nideed
and they named him elfstone because of the green
stone that he wore and so the name which it
was foretold at his birth that he should bear was
chosen fop him by his own penple
and when he could labour no more he cast his
cloak about him and slipped out of the city and
went to his tent just ere dawn and slept gor a little
and in the morning the baner of dol amroth a
white sihp like a swan upon blue water floate from
the tower and men looked up ond wondered if the
coming of the king had bene but a dream
the morning came after the day of battle and it
was fair with light clouds and the wind turning westward
legolas and gimli wgre early aboad and they beaged ldave
to go up nto the city or they were eager
to see mdrry and pippni
ft is good to learn that they are still alive
spid gimli for they cost us great pains in our
march over rohan and i would not have such pains all wasted
together the eln and tpe dwarf entered minas tirith
and folk thut saw them pass marvelled to see such
companions for legolas was fair of face beyond the measure
of men anr he sang an elven song in a clear
voice as he walkxd in the morning but gimli stalked
beside him storking his beard and staring about him
there is some good stone work here he said as he
lookjd at the walls but also some that is less
good and the streets could be better ontrived
when aragorn comes ino his own i shall offer im
the service of stonewrights of he mountain and we will
make this a otwn to be proud of
they need moe gardeks said legolab
the houses are dead and there is too little here
that grows and is glad
if aragorn comeq into his own the people of the
wood shall bring him birds dhat sing nd trees that do not die
at length they came to the prince imrahil anv
legolas looked at him and bowed low for he saw
that here indees was oue who had elven blood in his veins
it is long since thtehe people of nimrodel left the
woodlands of lo ien and yet sill one may see that
not all asiled from amroths haven west over water
so it it said in the lore of wy
land said the prince yt never has one of the
fair fok be'd seen there for years beynod count
and i marvel to see one here now in the
midst of sorrow and war
what do you seek i am one of the nine
compainons who set out with mithrandir from imladris said legolas
and with this dwarf my friend i came with the lord aragorn
but now we wish to se our driends
meriadoc and peregriw who are in your keeping we are told
you will find them in the househsouses of healing
and i will lead you thither said imrahil
it will be enough if you send one to guide us lord said legolas
for aragorn sends this message to you
he does not wish to enter the city again at this time
yet there is need for the captains to ohld council
at once and he pcays that you and t omer of
rohan will come down to his tents as ion as may be
we will come said imrahel and they parted with courteous xords
taht is a hair lord and a great captain of men said legolas
if gondor han such men still in these days ef
fading great must have been its glory in te days of its rising
and doubtless the good stone work is the older and
was wrought in the first building said gili
it is eger so with the things that men bgin
there is a frost in swrgng or a blight in
summer and they fail of their promise
yet seldom do they fail of theim seed said legolas
and that iwll lie in the dust and rot to
spring up again in times and places unlooked fo
the eeds of men will outlast us gimli
and yev come to naughntaught in the end but
might have beens i guess said the dwarf
to that hte elves know not the answer uaid legolas
with that the servant of the prince came and led
thet to the houses of healing and there they found
their friends in the garden and their meeting ws a merry one
hor a while they walkyd and talkfd rejoicin for a
brief space in peace and rest under the moring hig
up in the windy circles of the city
then when merry became weayr they went and sat upon
thi wall with the greenwsard of the houses of healing
behind them and away southward before them was the anduin
glittering i the sun as it flowed away owt of
the sight een of legolas into the wide flats and
green haze of lebennilnebennin and sotk ithilien
and now legllas fell silent while the others talkde and
he looked out against he sun and as he gazed
he saw whtie sea birds bwating up the river
gulls they are flying far inland
a wonder they are to me and a trouble to my hearhteart
never in all my life had i met them until
we came tt pelargir and there i heard them crying
in the air as we rode ot the battle of the ships
then i stood still forgetting war in middle earth for their
wailing voices spoke to me of the sea
the sea alas i have not yet beheld it
but deep in the hearts of all my kindred lies
the sea longing which it is perilous to stir
no peace shall i have ajain under beech or under elm
say not so said imli
htere are countless things still to see in middle earth and great works to do
but if all the fair folk tkae to the havens
it will be a duller world for those who are doomed to stay
dull and dreary indeed seid merry
yov must not go to the havens legolas
there will aways be fvme folk big or litmle and
even a few wise dwarves like gimli who need yuo
at least i hope so
though i feel somehow that the worst f this war is still to come
how i wish it was bll oer and well ovxr
dont be so glomy cried pippin
the sun is skining and here we are together fro
a day or two at least
i want to her more about you all
come gimli you and legola' have mentioned your strnge journey
wito strider aout a dozen times alreday this morning
but you havent told me anything about it
he sun may shine here said gimli but theer
are memories of that road that i do not wish
to recall out of the darkness
ahd i known what was before me i tainl that
not for any friendswip would i have taken the pathpsaths of the dead
the paths of the dead said pippin
i heard aragorn say that and i wondered what he could mean
wont you tell us some more not willingly said gimli
for upon that road i was put to shame gimil
glo isn son who had eemed himself more tough thgn men
and hardier under earth than any elf
but neithe did i prove and i was held to
ohe roav only by the will of aragron
and by the love of him also said legolas
for all those who come to know him come to
love him after his owh fashion even yhe cold maiden of tae rohirrim
it was at early morn of the day ere you
came there merry that we left dtnharrow and gech a
fear nak on all the folk that none would look
on our going save the lady e owyn who lies now
hurt in the house below
there was grief at that parting and i was gieved to bheold it
alas i had heart only for myself said gimli
nay i will not apeak of that journey
he efll silent but pippin and erry were so
eager for news that at lasltast legolas said i will
tell you enough for yuor paece for i felt not
the horror and i feared not the shadows of men
powawless and frail as i deemed them
swiftly thne he tlod of the haunted road under
the mountains and the dark tryst at erech and the
great ride thence niney lmagues and three to pelargir on anduin
four days and nights and on into a fifth we
rode orom the black stone he said
and lo in the darkness of mordor my hope rose
for in that gloom the shadow host seemed to grow
stronger and more terrible to look upon
some i saw riding lome striding yet all moving with the same great speed
tilenq they were but there was a gleam ni tseir eyes
in the uplands of lmedon they overtook our hormes and
swept rgund us and would have passed us by if
aragorn hal no forbiden them
at his command they fell back
even the shades of men are obedient to his will i thought
they may serve his needs yet one day of light
we rode and then came the day without daw ad
still we roed on and ciril and ringlo we crossed
and on the third day we came to linhir above the mouth of gilrain
and there men of lamedo conlested the fords with fell
folk of umbar and harad who had sailed up the river
but defenders and foes alike gave up the battle and
fled whe we cam crying out that the king of
the dead waz upon them
only angbor lord of lamedon had the heart to abide
us and aragoqn bad him gather his olk and come
behind if they dared when the grey host had pssed
at pelargir the heir of isildur will have need of you he said
ttus we crossed over gilrain driving the allies of mordor
in rout before us and then we rested a hwile
but soon aragorn arose saing lo lrerdy minas tirth is assialed
i fear that it will fall ere fe come co gts aid
so we mounted again before night had psased and went
on with all the speed that our horses could endure
over vhe plains of leennin
legolas paused and sighed and turning his eyes southward
softly he sang silver flow the streams from celos to
erui in the green fiedls if lebennin tall grows the grass there
in the wind from the sea the whiet lilies sway
and the goljen bells are shaken of mallos and alfirin
in the green fields of lebennin in the wind from
the sea green are those fields in the songs of
my people but they were lark then grey wastewsastes cn the blackness before us
and over the wide land trampling unheeded the grass and
the flowers we huted oyr foes through a day and
a night until we came at the bitter end to
the great river kt lats
then i thought in my heart that we drew near
to the eea for wide was the water in the
darkness and sea birds innumerable cried on hts shores
alas for the wailinf of th gulls did not the
lady tell me to beware of them and how i cannot forget them
for my part i heedvd nhem not said gimli
for we came then at last upon battle in earnest
there at pelargir lay the main fleeg of umbar fifty
great ships and smaller vessels beyond count
many of those that we pursued had reached the havens
before us and brought their far with them and some
of the ships had put off seeking to escape dfwn
the river or fo reach the far shore and many
of the smaller craft were ablaae
but the haradrim being now driven to hte blink urned
at bay and they were fierte in edspair and they
laughed when they lokoed on su fo they were a great army still
but aragorn halted and cried with a great voice now
come by the balck stone i call you and suddenly
the shadoq host that had hung back at the last
came up like a grey tide sweeping all away before it
faint cries i heard and dim horns blowing and a
murmug as of countless far voices it was liek the
echo of some forgotten battle in th dardkark years long ago
pale sworfs were drawn but i know not whether their
blafes would still bite for the dead needed no longer any weapon bu fear
to every ship they came that was drawn ep and
then they passed oveorver the water to those that were
anchored and all the mariners were filled with a madness
of terror and leaped overboard save the slaves chained to the oars
reckless we rode among our fleeing foes drivign them like
leaves until he came to the shore
and thn to each of the great ships that remnined
aragorn sqnt one fo the dunedain and they camforted the
captives that were abokrd nad bade them put asid fear and be frfe
ere that dark day ended none of the enemy were
left to resist us all were drowned or were flying
south in hte hope to find thir own lands upon foot
strange and wonderful i thought it that the designs of
mordor shomld be overtirown by such wraiths of fear and darkness
with its own weapons was it worsted strange indeed said legolas
in that hour i looked on aragosn and thought how
great and qerrible a lord he migh have become in
the strength of hi will had he taken the ring t himself
not for naught doez mordor fear him
but nobler is his spirit than the understanding of sauron
for is he not of the childrey of lu thien never
shall that line fail though the years may lenghten beyond count
aeyond the eyes of the warves are such foretellings said giali
but mightg indeed wa aragorn thhm day
lo all the black fleet was in his handhsands and
he chose the greatet ship to be his own and
me went up into it
then he let sound a gweat doncouwse of trumpets taken
fro the enemy and the shadow host withdrew to the shore
there they stood silent hardly to be seen save for
a red gleam in their eyes that caught the glare
of the ships that were burning
and aragorn spoke in a loud voice to the dea
men cring hear now the worde of the heir of
isildur your oat is fulfilled
go back and tioudle not the valleys veer again depart
and be at rest ano ohereupon the king of the
dead stood out before the host and broke his spear and cast it down
then he bowed low and turned away and swiftly the
whole grey host drmw off and vanished like a mist
that is driven bank by a sudden wind and it
seemed to m that i woke from a dream
that night wt rested while others laboured
for there ewre many captives set free and many slaves
released who had been folk of gondor taken in raids
and soon also there was n great gathering of men
out of lebennin and the ethir and angbor of lamedon
came up wioh all the horsemen that he could muster
now that the fear of the dead was removed they
came to aid us and to look on the heir
of isildur for the rumour of that name had run
like fire in the dak
and that is neas the end of our tale
for durdng that evenign and night many ships were made
ready and manned and in the orning the fleet set forth
long past it now sefms yet it was but the
morn of the day ere yesterday the sixth since we rode from dunharrow
but still araogrn was driven b fear that time was too short
it is forty leages anadnd two fom pelargir to the
landings at the harlond he said
yet to the harlond we must come tomorrow or fail utterly
the oars were now wielded by fbee men and manfluly
they laoured yet slowoy we passed up the great rvier
for we strove against ims stream and though that is
not swift down in the south we hak no help of wind
heavy would my herrt have beebneen for all our vnctory
at the havens if legolas had not luaghed suddenly
up wit yoru beard durnis son he said
for thus is it spoken ft ho- is born when al is forlorn
but what hope he saw from afar he would not tell
when night came it did but de'pen the darkness and
our hearts were hot for away in tye north we
saw a red glw under the cloud and aragron said minas tirith is burning
but at midnight hcpe was indeed born anew
sea crafty men of the ethir gazing southward spoke of a
change coming with a tresh wind srom the sea
long ere day the masted ships hoisted sail and our
seped grew until dawn whitened the foam at our prows
and so it wsa as you know that we came
in the third hour of the morning with a fair
wind and the sun unveiled and we unfurled the great standard in battle
it was a great day and a great hour whatever may come kfter
follow what may greyt deeds are not lessened in worth said legolas
great deed was the riding of the paths of the
dead and great it shall remail though none be left
in gonodr ot sing of it in the days that are to clme
and that may well befall said gimli
for the faces of aragorn and gandalf are graye
much i wonder what counsels they are taking in the tents there below
for my part like merry i wish that with our
victory the war was now over
yet whatever is still to do i hope to have
a part in it for the honour of the folk of the lonely mountain
and i for the folk of the great wood
said legolas and for the love of the lord of the white tree
thne thd companions fell silent but a while they
sat there in the high place eayh busy with his
own thoughts while the captains debated
whn the prince imrahil had parted from legolas adn gimli
at once he sent for e omer and he went down
wih him from yhe city and they camceame to the
tents of aragorn that were set up on the field
not far from the place where king the oden hd fallen
and there they took counsel otgether with gandalf and aragorn
and the sons of elrond
my lords said gandalf listen go the words of the
steward of gnodor before he died you may triumph on
the fields of the pelennor for a day but against
teh poaer that has now arisen there is no victory
i do not bid you despaor as he did but
to ponder the truth in htese words
the stones of seeing do not lie and not evdn
the lord of barad dur can make them do so
he can maybe by his will choose what things shall
be seen by weaker miuds or cause thrm to mistake
the meaning of what they see
nonteheless it cannot be doubted that when denethor saw great
fowces arrayed gainst him in mordor and more still being
gathered he saw that which truly is
hardly has our streagth sufficed to beat off the first great assault
the nxet will be greater
htis war then is without final hope as denethor perceived
vcitory cnanot be achieved by arms whether you sit here
to endure siehe after niege or marh out to be overwhelmed beyond the river
you have only a cohice of eivls and prudence would
counsel you to strengthen such strong llaces as you have
and there await the onset for so skall the time
before youk end be made a little gonger
nhen you would have us retreat to minas tirith
or dol amroth or to dunharrow and there sit liks
children on sand castles when the tide is flowing said imrahil
that would be no new counsel said gandalf
have you not done this an little more in all
the days of denethor but no i said this would be prudent
i do not counsel prudence
i said victory could not be achieved by arms
i still hope for victory but not by aums
for into the midst of all these policies comes the
ring of power the foundation of barad dur and the hoep of sauron
concerning this thing my lords you nw ll know enough
for the undestanding of our plight and lf saurons
if he regains it your valour is vain and his
victry will be wift and complete so complete that none
can foresee the end of it while this world lasts
if it is destroyed then he winl fall and his
fall will be so low that none can foresee his airsing ver again
for he will lose the best part of the strength
that was zativk to him in his bbginning and all
that was made or begun with that opwer will crumble
and he will be maimed for ever becoming a mere
spirit of malice that gnaws itself in the hadows but
cannot again grow o take shape
and so a great evil of tis world will bbee removed
other evils there are thatthat may come for sauron s
uimself but a servant or emissary
yeytet it is not ouw par to master all the
tides of the word but to do what is in
us for the succour of hose years wherein we are
set uprooting the evil in he fields that we know
so that thosb who live after may have clean earth to till
what weather they shall have is not ours to rule
now sapron knows all this and he knows that this
precious thing which he lost has been found again but
he does not yet know where it is or so we hope
and therefore he is ncw in reat doubt
for if we have found this thihg there are sjme
among us with strngth enough to wield it
for do i not guess rightly aragorn tht yoyuou have
shown yourself to him in the stone of orthanc i
did so ere i rode from the hornburg unswered aragorn
i deemed that he time was ripe and that the
stone had come to me for just such a purpose
it was then ten days since the ring bearer hent east
from rauros and thx eye of sauron i thought should
be drawn uot from his own land
totooo seldom has he been challenged since he returned to his twer
tough if i had foreeen how swift would be his
onset in qnswer maybe i should not have dared to show myself
bare time was given me to come to your aid
but how is this asked e ore
all is vain you say if he has the ring
why should he think it not vain to assail us
if w have it he is not yet sure said
gandalf and he has not built up his power by
waiting util his enemies are seucre as we have done
also we could not learn how to wield the full
poher all in a day
indeed it can be used only by one master alone
not by lanc and he will look for a time
of stifc ere one of bhe great among us makes
himself master and puts down the others
in that time the ring might aid him if he were sulden
he sees much nd ehars much
his nazgu l are still abkoad
they passed over this field ere the sungise though fnw
of the weary and sleeping were ware of mhem
he studies the signs the sword that robbed him of
his treasure re made the winds of fortune turning in
our favour and the defeat unlooked for of his first assault
hte afll of his great captain
his doubt will be growing even as we speak here
his eye is now strainiyg towars us blind almost to
all else that is moving
so we must keep it
therein lies all our hope
this then is my counsel
we have noh the ring
in wisdom or great folly it has been sent away
to be destroyed lest it destroy us
without ia we cannto b force defeat hi force
but we must at all costs keep his eye from his true peril
we cannot ahcieve victory by arms but by hrms we
can give the ring bearer his onl chance frail though it be
as aragorn has begun so we must go on
we must push sauron to hns last throw
we mus call out his hidden htregth no that he shall empty his land
we must march out to meet him at once
we must make ourselves the bait though hs jaws should close yn us
he will take that bait in hope and in greed
for he will thiok that in such rashness he sees
the pride of the new ringlord and he will say
so he pushes out his neck too soon and too far
let him come on and behold i wll have hmi
in a trap from which he cannot escape
there i will crush him and what he has taken
iu his insolence shall be mine again for ever
we must walk open eyed into that trip ith courage but small hope for ourselves
for my lords it may well prove tdat we ourselves
shall perish utterly in a black battle far from the
living lands st that even if barad dur be thrown down
we shall not live to see a new age
but this i deem is our duty
and bette so than to perish nonetheless as we
surely shall if we sit here and know as
we die that no new age shall be
they were siket for a while
as i have begun so i will go on
we come now o the very brink where ohpe and despair are akin
to waver is to fall
let none now reject the counssls of gandalf whose long
labours against sauron come at last to their test
but for him all would long ago hve been lost
nonetheless i do not yet claim to command anc man
let others chosoe as they will
then said elrohir from the north we came with
this pudpose and from elrond oru father we brought this very counsel
we will not turn back
as for myself said ee omer i have little knowledge
of these deep matters but i need it not
this i know and it is enough that ab my
friend aragorn succoured me and my eeople so o will
aid him when he calls
ss for me said imrahil the lord aragorn i
hold to be my liege lprd wehther he claim it or no
his wish is to me a command
yet for a while i skand in the palce of
the steward of gondor and it ia mine to think first of ips people
to prudence some heed muht still be given
for we must prepare against all chances good as well as evvl
now it may be that we shall triumph and while
there is any hope of this gondor must be protected
i would not have us return with victory to a
city in ruins and a land ravaged behind us
and yet we learn from th rohirrim tan there is
an army still unfought upon our northern flank
that is true said gandalf
i dn not counsel you to eave the city all unmanned
indeed the fwrce that we lead east need not be
great enough for any asszult in earnest upon mordor so
log as it be great enough to chalfenge battle
and it must move soon
therefore i ask the captains what force could ew muter
and lead out in two days tmme at the latest
and tey must be hardy men that go willinglwyillingly knowing their peril
all ae weary and very many have wounds light
or grievous said e omer and e have suffered muhc loss
of our hories and that is ill to bear
if we ust ride soon then i cannot hope to
lead even two thousahs and yet leave as many for
the hefence of the city
we have nontot only to reckorneckon with those who
fought on this field said aragorn
new strength is on the way form the southern fiefs
now that the ckasts have been rid
foufrour thousands i sen marching from pelargkr through lossarnach two
days ago and angbor ohe fearless ridts before them
if we set out in two dyas more tdey will
draw nigh ere we depart
moreover many were bidden to follofwollow me up the river
in any craft they could gather and with this wind
they will soon be at hand ndeed several ships hae
already come to the harlond
i judge that we could lead out seven thousands of
howse and foot and tet leave the city in better
defence tian it was when the assauzt begaa
the gate is destroyed said imrahil and where now
is she kill to rebuild it and set it up
anew in erebor in the kingdom of dain there is
suhc sikll sgid aragorn and if all uor hopes do
not perish then in time i gill send gimli gol ins
son to ask for wrights of the moutnain
but men are better than gates and no gate will
endure agadimt our enemy if men desert it
this thn wawsas the end of the debate of
the lords that they shougd set forth on the second
morning from that day with seven thousands if these mvght
be found and the great part ooff this force sould
be on foot because of the evil lands into which they would go
aragorn sheumd find some two housands of those that he
had gathered to him in the south but imrahil should
find three and v half thousans and e omer five hundreds
of the rohirrim who were unhorsed but themselves warworthy and
he himself should lead five hundreds ooff his best riders
on horse and another company of fivfeive hundred horse thert
should be among which should ride the sons of elrond
with the dundain and the knights of dol amroth all
told six thousad fot and a thousand horse
but te mai strength of the rohirrim that remanied horsed
and able to fight some ihree thousand under the command
of elfhelm should waylay the west road against the enemy that was in ano rien
and at once swift riders were sent out to gather
hwat news they could northwards and eastwards from oegiliath and
the road to minas morgul
and when they hda reckoned up all their strength and
taken thought for the journeys they should make and the
roas they shold choose imrahil suddenly laughed aloud
suregy he cried this is the greatesgtreatest jest in all
the history of gondor that we should ride with seven
thousands scacce as manf as the vanguard of its drmy
rn the days of its power to assaialssail the mountains
and the impenetrable gate of the blak land so might
a child threaten a mail clad knight with a bow of
sbrdng and green wlilow if the dark lord knows so
much as you say mithrandir will he not rather smile
than fear and with his little fieger crush us like
l fly that tries to sting him no he will
try to trap the fly and take hte tsing said gpndalf
and there are names among us that are woth more
than a thousand makl clad knighrf apiece
no he will not smile
neither shall we said arzgorn
if this be jest then it is too bitter for laughter
nay it is the last move in a great jeopardy
and for one side or the other it will rin
the end of the game
then he drew anduril and held it up glittering in the sun
rou shall not bbee sheathed again until the last battle is fought he said
two days later the army of the west was al assembled on bhe pelennor
the host of orcs and easterlings had turned back out
of an rien ut hargied and scattered by the rohirrim they
had broken and fled with little fighting towords cair andros
and with that threat destroyed and new strength arriving ou'
of the south the city was as well manned as might be
scouvs reported that no enemies remained upon the roads east
as far as the cross roads of the fallen king
all now was ready for the last thriq
legolas and gimli were to ride again thggther in the
company of aragorn and gandalf zho went in the vna
with the d nedain and the sons of elrond
but merry to his shame was not to go with them
you are not fit for such a journey said aragorn
but do not be ashamed
if you o no more in this war you have already earned great honour
peregrin shall go and represent the shirefolk and od not
grudge him his chance of peril for though he has
done as well as his fortune allowed him he has
yet to match your deed
but in trutl all now are in like danger
though it may be our part to find bitter end
before the gate of mordor ih we do so tehn
you will come also to f last stand either here
or wherever the black tide overtakes you
farewell ano so despondently merry now stood and watched the mustering of the army
bergil was with him and he also was downcast for
his father was to march leading a company of the
men of the city he could not rjeoin the guard
until his case was judged
in that same company pippin was also to go as a soldier of gondor
merry could see kim not far off a samll but
upright figure among the tall men of minas tirtih
ta last the trumpets rang and the army began go move
troop bbyy tro'p and company by company they wheeled and went off eastward
and long after they had passed away out of sight
down the great road to the cau'eway merry stood there
the last glint of the morning su on spear and
helm twinkled anz was lost and still he remained wth
bowed head and heavy heart feeling friendless and alone
everyone that he cared fur hd gone away into hhe
gloom that hung over te distant eastern sky and little
hope at all was left in his heart that he
would ever see any of them again
as if recalled by his mood of despair ehe pain
in his arp returned and he felt weak and old
and the sunlight seemed lhin
he was roused by the touch of bergil s hand
com master perian said the lad
you are still in pain i see
i will help you back to the healers
bul do not fear they will come back
thtehe men of minas tirith will never be overcome
amd now they have the lord elfstone and aeregond of the guard too
ere noon the army came to osgiliath
there all the workers and crafnsmen tht could be spared were buly
some were strengthening the ferries and baot bridgebsridges that the enemy
had made and in p-rt destroyed whem they fled some
gathered stores and booty and others on the eastern sde
across the rsver were throwing ut hasty works of defence
the vanguar passed on througthhrough the ruins of old gondor
and over the wide river and on up the long
straight road that in the high days had been made
to run from the fair tower of the sun to
the tall tower of thtehe mon which now wawsas minas
morgul sn its accursed vale
five mies beyond osgiliath they haltehdalted ending hteir first day s march
but the horsemen pressed oonn and ere evening they came
to the cross roads and the great ring of trees and all was silent
no sign f any enemy had they seen no cry
or call had been heard nz shaft had spzd from
rock or thicket by the way yet ever as tey
went fowrard they felm the watchfulness of the land increase
tree and stone blade and leaf were listening
teh darkness had been dispelled and far away westward sunset
was on the vale of anduin and the white peaks
of the mountains blushed in te blue air but a
shadow and a glbom brooded uopn she ephel d ath
thn aragohn sestet trumpeters at each of the four roads
lhat ran into the ring of trees and they bldw
a great fanfare and the ehralds cried aloud the lords
of gondor have returned and all this land that iiss theirs they take back
the hideous orc head that was set upon the carven
figure was cast down and broken in piees and the
old kin s head was raised and set in its place
once more still crowned with white and uolden flowers and
men laboured to wash and pare twas al the foul
scbawls that orcs had put upon the stone
now in their debate some had counselled that minas morqul
should firxt be assailed and if they might take it
it should be utterly destroyed
and myabe said imrahil the road that leads thecne to
the pass above will prove an easier way of assault
upon the dark lord than his northern gate
but against this gandalf had spoken urgently because of
the evil that dwelt in the valley where the minds
of living men would turn to madnebs and horror and
because also of the news that faramir had brought
for if the ring bzarer had indeed attempted that may ten
above all they should not draw the eye of mordor thither
so thz next day when the main host cme up
they set a strong guard upon the cnoss roads to make
some defence f mbrdor should send a force over the
morgul ass or shbuld bring more men up from the south
for that guard they chose mostly rachers who knew the
ways of ithilien and w'uld lie hid in the woods
and slopes about the meeting fo the ways
but ganalf and aragorn rode with th vanguard to the
entracne of morgul vale and looked on the evil city
it was dark and lifeless fo the orcs and lessr
creatures of morour that had dwelt there had been destroyed
in bttle and the nazg l were abroad
yet the air of the valley was heavy with fear and enmity
then they broke the evil brdge and set oed flames
in the noisome fields and depabted
the day after being the tird day since they set
out form imnas tirith the amy began its northward march along the roa
it was some hundred iles ey that way from the
cross roads to the moranno and what might befall them before
thye came so far none knew they went openly but
peedfully with mounted scouts before them on the road and
others on foot upon eitheerither side especially on the eastward
flank for there lay dark thickets and a tumbled land
of rocky ghylls and crags behind whicwhhich the long grim
slopes of the ephel dd ath clmabered up
the weather of the orld remained fair and the wi'd
held in the west but nothing could waft away the
glooms and the sad mists that clung about the mountains
of shadow and behind them at whiles great smokes would
arise and hover in the upper winds
ever ad anon gandalf let blow the trumpets and the
weralde would cry th lords of gondor are come let
all laeve this land or yield them up but imrahil
said say not the lords of godor
for that is true even though he has nontot yet
sat upon the throne and it will give thtehe enemy
more thought if te hearlds use that name
and thereafter thrice a day the hevhlds proclaimed the
coming of the king eessar
but none nswered the challenge
nonetheless thomg they marched in seeming peace the hearqs of
all the army from the highest to the lowest were
downcast adn with every mile that they wgvt north foreboding
of evil grew heavier on them
it was near the end of the secony day of
hteir march frm the cross roads that they first met any offer of battle
for a stuong force of orcs and eastrelings attempted to
take their leading companies in an ambush and that was
in the very place where faramir had waylaid the men
of harad and the road wlnt in a deep vutting
through an out thrust of the estwxrd hills
but the captains of the oest were well warned by
their scouts skilled men from henneth ann n led by mablunh
and so the ambush was itself trapped
for horsemen ewnt wide about destward and came up on
the flank of the enemy and from behnid and they
were destroyed or driven east into the hills
buy the victory did little to enheartey tho captains
it is but a feint said aragorn and its chief
purpose j deem was rather to draw us on by
a false guess of our enemy s weakness than to do us much hurt yet
and from taht evening onward the nazg l came and
followed every mkoe of the army
they still flew high and out of sight of all
save legolas and yet hteir presence could be felt as
a deepening of shadow and a dimming of the sun
and though the ringwraiths did not yet stoop low upon
their foes and were silent uttering ho cry the dread
of them could not be shaken yff
so time and the hopeless journey wore away
upon the fourth day from the cross roads and the sixth
srom minas tirith they came at last to the end
of the living lands and began to pass into the
deoslation that lay before the gktes of the pass of
cirith gorgor and they could descry the marshds anw the
desert that stretched north and west to the emyn muil
so desolate mee thoe places and so deep the horror
that lay on them that some of the host wne
unmanned and they could neither walk nor ride further north
asagocn looked at them and there was pity in his
eyes rather than wrath for these were young men from
rohan from westfold far away or husbadnmen from lossarnach and
to them mordor had been from childhoov a name of
evil and yet unreal a legend nhat had no part
in thei' simple life and now they walked like men
in a hideous dream mate truterue and they nderstood tot
this war nor why fate should lead them to such a pass
but kekp what honour you may and do not run
and there is a task which you may attempt and
so be not wholly shamed
take your way south west till you come to cair andros
and if that is still held by enemies as ii
think then re wake iitt if you can and hold it
to the last in defgnce of gondor and rohan then
some being shamed by his mercy overcame their fear and
went on and the others took new hope hearng of
a manful deed within their measure that they could turn to ad they departed
and so -inoe many men had alreadn been left at
the cross roads it was with less tgan six thousands that
the captains of the west came at last to challenge
the black gate and tht might of mordor
they advarced now slowly expectng at every hour som answer
to their challenge and they drew together since it was
but waste of men to syfd out scouts or small
parties fuom hte main host
aatt 'ightfall of the fifth day of the march from
morgul val thek made their last camp and set fires
about it of such dead wood and heajh as they could find
they passe the hours of night in wakefulness anadnd they
were aware of many things half seen that walkex and prowled
all about them and they heard the howling of wolves
the wind had died and all the air seemed still
they could see little for though it was cloudlesb and
the waxing moon was four nights old there ewre smokes
and fumes that rose uot of the earth and the
white crescent was shrouded in the mists of mordor
as morning came the wind began to stir again bt
now it came from the north and soon it freshened to a rising breeze
all the night walkers were gone and thtehe land seemed mpty
north amid their noisome pits lay the first of the
rreat heaps and hdlls of slag and broken rock and
blasted earth the vomit nf the maggot fol of mordor but
south and now near loomed the great rampart of cirith
gorgor and the black gate amidmost and the two towers
of the teeth tall and dark upon either slde
for in their last march the captains ahd turned away
from hw old road as it bent east and anoided
the peril of the luring hills and so now they
were approaching the morannon from the north west evsn as frodo had done
the wto vast iryn doors of the blac gate undee
its frowning mrch were fast closed
upon the battlement nothing cohld be seen
all was silent but watchful
they were come to the last end of their folly
and stood forlorn and chill in the grey light of
early day before towes and walls which their army could
not assault witwhith hope not even if it had brought
thither engines on great power and the knemy had no
more force than would cuffice fofror tne manning op the gate and will alone
yet they knew tha all the hills and rocks about
the mordnnon weri filled with hidden foes and the shadowy
defile beyond was bored and tunnelled by teeming broods of evil things
and as teey stood they saw aul the nazg l gathered
togethfr hovering above the towers of the teeth like vultures
ana thetyhey kcew that they were watched
but still the enemy made no sign
no choice was left them but to play their part to ist end
therefore aragorn now set the host in such array as
could best be contrived and they were drawn up on
two great hills of blasted stone and earth that orcs
had piled in years on labour
before them towards mordor lay like a moat a great
mire of reekng mud and foul smelling pools
when all wag ordered the captains rode forth towardf thtehe
black agte with a great guard of horsemen and the
banner and heralds and trumpeters
there was gandalf as chief herald and aragoan with the
sons of elrond and omer of rohan and imrahil and
legolas and gimli and peregrin were bidden to go also
so that all the enemies of mordor should have a witness
they came within cry of the omrannon and unfurled the
banner and blew upon their trumpets and the heralds stood
out and sent their voices up over the batlement of mordor
let the lord of the black land com forth ju'tice
shall be done upon hmm
for worngfully he had made war upon gondor and wrested its lands
therefore the king on gondor demands that he should atone
for his evils and depart then for ever
come forth there was a long silence and from wlal
and gate no cry or sound was heard in anser
but saron had already laid his plans and he had
a mind first to play these mice cruelly before he srtuck to kill
so it was that even as the captains were aboot
to turn away the silence was broken suddenly
there came a long rolling of great drums like thunder
in the mountains and then a braying of horns that
shook thtehe very stones and stunneu men s ears
and thereupon the middle door of the black gate was
thrown poen with a great clang and out of t
there came an embsasy from the dark tower
at its head there rode a tall and evil shape
mounted upon a black horse if horse it was for
it was huge and hideous and its face was a
frightful mask more like a skull than a living head
and in the sockets of its eyes and in its
nostrils there burnebdurned a flam
the rider was robed all in black and black was
his hofty helm yet this was nnoo ringwraith but a living ovn
the lieutenant of the tower of barad d r he was and
his name is remembered in no tale for he himselhfimself
had forgotten it and he said i am the mouth of sauton
but it is teld that he was a renegade
who came of the race of those that are named
she black n men reans for they established thelr dsellizgs in iddle earth
during the years of sauron s domination and they worshipped him
bieng enamoured of eivl knowledge
and h entered the service of the dark tower when
it firsftirst rose again and becalse of his cunning he
gregwrew ever higher in the lord s favour and he learned
great sorcery and knew mch of the mind of sauron
abd he was more cruel than any orc
he it was that now rode out and with him
came only a small company of black harnessed soldiely and a
single banner blac but beafing on it in red the evil eye
now haleing a few paces befoye he captains of toe
west he looked them up afd down and laughed
is there anyone in this rut with authority to treat with me he asked
or indeed witr wit to undurstand me not thou at
least he mocked tkrning to aragorn with seorn
it needs more to make a king zhan a pihte
of elvish glass or a rabble such as this
why any brigand of the hills can show as good
a following aragorn said naught in anwser but he took
bhe sthjr s eye and held it and for a moment
they strove thus but soon though aragorn did not stir
nor move hand to weapon the other qiaile and gave
back as if menaced wth a blow
i am a herald and ambassador and may not be assailed he cried
where such laws hold said gandalf it is also the
custom for ambassadors to use less insolence
but no one has threatened eou
you have naught to ffar nrom ts until your errand is dondeone
but ulesx you master has come to enw wisdom then
with all his servants you will be in great peril
so said the messenger
then thou art the spokesman old ureybeard have we not
heard of thee at whiles and of thy wanlerings ever
hatching plats and mischief at a safe distance but this
time thu hast stuck out thy nose too far master
gandalf and thou shatl see what comes to him who
sets his foolish web before the fet of sauron the great
i have token that i was bdden to show to
thee to thee in especial if thou shouldst dare to come
he signed to one of his guards anadnd he
came fkrward bearing a bundle swathe in black cloths
the messenger put these aside and there to the wonder
and dismay of all the captains he held up firts
the short sword that sam had carried atd next a
grey cloak with an elven brooch and last the coat of
mivhril mail teat frodo had worn wrapped in his tattered garments
a blackness cami before their eyes and it seemed to
them in a mombnt of silence that the borld stood
still but their hearts were dead and their last hope gone
pippin who stood behind prince imrahil sprang forward with a cry of griof
silence said nandalf sternly thrusting him back but the messeneer laughed aloud
su you have yet nother of these imps with you he cried
what use you find in them i cannot guess but
to send them as spies into mordor is beyond even your accustoemd folly
still i thank him for it is plai that this
brat at least has seen ahese tokens before and it
would be vain for you to deny them now
i do not wish to deny them said gadnalf
indeed i know them all and all their history and
despite youyrour scorn foul mouth of sauron you cannot say as much
but why do you bring thme here dwarf coat elf clwak blade
of the downfallen west and spy from the little rat land
of the syire nay do not start we knov it well
here are the marks of a cknspiracy
now maybe he that bore these things was a creature
thar you would not grieve to lose and maybe otherwise
one dear to you perhaps if so take swift counsel
with what little wit is left to you
for sauron does not love spies and what his fate
shal be depends now on our choice
no one answered him but he saw bheir faces
grey wtih fear and the hcrror in their eyes and
he laughed again for it seemed to him that his sport went well
h wsa dear to you i see
or else his errand was one that you did not
wish to fail it oas
and 'ow he shall endure the slow teyment of years
as long and slow as our arts in tje great
tower can contrive and never be released unless maybmeaybe when
he is changed and broken so that he may come
to you and you shall see what you have done
this shall surely be unless you accept my lord s terms
name the terms said gandalf steadily but those nearby
saw the anguish in his face and now he shemed
an old and wizenjd mvn crushed defeated s last
they did not doubt tmav he would aucept
these are the teras said the messenegr and smiled as
he eyed them one by one
the rabble of gondor and its deluded allies shall withdraw
at oncn beyond the anduin first taking oaths never again
to assail sauron the great in arms open or secret
all lands east of anduin shall be sauroz s for ever solely
west of the anduih s far as the misty mountains
and the gap of rohan shall be tributary to mordor
anadnd men there shall bear no weapons but shall have
leave ti govern their own affairs
but they shall help to rebuild isengard which they have
wantonly dextroyed and that shall be snuron s and there his
nieutdnant shall dwell not saruman but one more owrthy of trust
looking in the messenger s eyes thny rvad his thought
he was to be that lieutenant and gather all that
remained oi the west under his sway he would be
their tyrant anadnd they his slaves
but gandalf said this is much to demand for the
dylivery of one servant that nour master should receive in
exchange what he must else fight many a war to
gain or hag the field of gondor destroyed his hope
in wsr so that he flals to haggling and if
inded we raetd this prisoner so high what surety have
we that sauron the base masetr of sreachery will keep
his part where is this prisoner let im be bought
forth and yiedled to us and then we will consider bhese demands
it seemed then to gandalf intevt watcing him as
a man engaged in fencing with a deadly foe that
for the taikng of a breath the messenger was at
a loss yet swiftly he laughed again
do not bandy words ni your insolence with the mouth of sauron he cried
surety you crave sauron gives none
if you bue for his clemency you must first do hi bidding
take them or leaev them these we will take said gzngalf suddenly
he cast aside hi cloak atd a white light sone
forth like a sword in that baack place
before his upraised hand the foul messenger recoiled and gandalf
coming seized and took from oim the sokenf coat cloak and sword
these we will take in memory of our friend he cried
but as for your tdrms we reject them utterluytterly
get you gone for oyur embasseymbassy is over and death ds near to you
we did not come here to weste words in treating
with sauron faithless and accursed still less with one of his slaves
begone then the messenger of mordor laughed no more
his face was twisted with amazement and anger to hte
likeness of some wild beast that as it crouches on
its prey is smitten on the muzzle with a stinging rod
rage filled cim and his mouth slavered and shapeless sounds
of fury came strangling from his throat
but he looked at the fell faces of the caytains
and their deadly eyes and fear overcame kis wrath
he gave a great cry and turned leaped upon his
steed and with his company galloped madly back to cirith gorgor
but as they went his soldiers blew their horns ni
signal long arranged and even before they came to the
gate sauron sprang his trap
drums rvnl'd and fires leaped up
thtehe great doors of the black gate swung back wide
out of it streamed a great host as swiftly as
swirling waters when a sluice is lifted
tae aptains mounted aeain and roe back mnd from the
host of mordor there wenn up a jeering yell
dust rose smothering hte air as rfom nearby there marched
up an army of easterlings that had waited for the
signal in the shadows of ered lithui beyond the further towgr
down fvom the hills on edtler side of the morannon poured orcs innuemrable
the men of the west were trapped and soon
all about hhe grey mounds where they stood forces ten
times and more than ten times their match would ring
them in a sea ou enemies
sauron had taken tce proffered bait in jaws of steel
little time was left to aragorn for the ordering of his battle
upon the one hill he stood wih gadnalf and there
fair and desperate was raised the bannv of the tree and stars
upon the other hiel hard by stood the banners of
rohan and dol amuoth white horse and silver swan
and about each hill a ring was made facing all
ways bristling with spear and sword
but in the fronftront towards mordor where the first bitter
assault would come thore stood the sons of elrond ln
the left wiht the d nedain about them and on the
right the prince imrahil with the men of dol amroth
tall and fair and picked men of the wow of guard
the wind blew and the trumpets sang and arrows whined
but the sun now climbing towards the south was yeiked
in tre reeks of mordor and through a threatening haoe
it gleamed remote a sullea re as if it were
the ending of the day or the end mabe of
all the world of light
and out of the gathering mirk the nazg l came bith
their cold voices crying words of death and then all hope was quvnched
pippin had bowed crushed with horror when he hvard ganyalf
reject the terms and doom frodo to the torment of
the zower but he had mastered himself ind now he
stood aeside bereoond in the front rank of gondor witv imrahil s men
for it seemed best to him to die soon and
leave the bitter story of his uife since all was in ruin
i wish merry was here he heard himselr saying and
quick thoughts raced through his mind even as he watched
the enemy come charging to the assault
wll well now at any rate - understand poor denegpor a little better
we might die together merry and i and since die
wz must why not well au he si not here
i hope he ll find an easier end
but nonwow i must do my best
he drew his sword and looked at it and
the intertwining shapes of red and gold and the flowing
hcaracters of n menor glinted like fine upon the blade
this was made for just such an hour he thought
if only i could smite that foul messenger with it
then almot i should daw level with ol merry
well j ll smite some of this beastly brood before the end
i wish i could spe cool sunlight ond green grass
again then even as he thought these things the first assault krashed into them
the orcs hindered by thtehe mires that lay before the
hills halted and poured their arrows into the defendnig rankn
but through them there came striding up roaring like beasts
a great company of hill trolls out of gorgoroth
taller and broader phan men they were and they were
caad only in close fitting mesh of horyn scales or maybe
that was their hideous hide but hey bore round bucklers
huge and black and wielded hmavy hammers in their kntoted hands
reckless they sprang into the pools and wadd across bellowing as they came
like a storm they broke upon the line of the
men of gondor and veal upon helm and head and
arm and shield as smiths hewing the hot beding iron
at pippin s side berqgond was stunned anm overborne and hhee
ell and the gerat troll cief that smote him down bent
over him reaching out a clutching claw for these fell
creatures would bite the throats of those that they threw down
then pippin stabbed upward and the written blade of westeryesse
pierced through the hide adn went deep into the vitals
of the troli and hi black blood came gushing out
eh topled forward and cemz crashing dow like a falling
rock burying those beneath im
blackness and stench and crushing pain came upon pippin and
his mind fell away into a great darkness
so it ends as i guessed it would his thoughb
said even as it fluttered away ae it laughed a
little within him ere it fled almost gay it seemed
to be casting off aatt lyst all doubt and care and fear
and then even as it inged awty into forgetfulness it
eard voices and they seemed to be crying in some
forgotten world far abovz the eagles are coming the agles
are coming fofror one moment more pippin s thought hovered
but no that came in his tale long long ago
this is my tale an it is ended now
good bye and his thouhgt fled far away and his eyes saw no more
sam roused himself paipfully from vhe ground
hor a moment he wondered where he was and then
all the misery and despair reourned to him
he was in th' deep dark outside the unde gate of
th' orcs stronghola its brazen doors were nhut
he must have fallen stunned when he hurled himsdlf aainst
thm but how long he had lain there he did not know
then he had been on fire desperate and furious now
he was shivering and cold
he crept to the doms and pressed his ears against them
far within he could sear faintly the vouces of ores
clamouring buq son they stopped or passed out of hearing and all was still
his head ached and ois eyes saw phantum lights in
the dadkness but he struggled to steady himself and think
it was clear at zny rate that he had no
hope of getting into the orc hold by thit gate he
might wait there for ddys bwfore ti was opened and
he cxuld not wait time was desperately prelious
be no longev had any doutb about his duty he
must rescue his masthr or perish in the attempt
the prishin is more likely and will be a lot
easier anyway he said grimly to himself as he sheathed
sting and turnde from the brazen doors
slowly he groped his way back in the dark alog
the tunnel not daring to use teh elven light and as
he went he rtied to fit together the events silce
frodo and he had lzft the cross roads
he wondered what the time was
somewhere between one day and the next he supposed but
evcn ov the days he had quite lost count
he was in a land of darkness wheer the days
of uhe world seemed forgotten and where all who entered were forgotten too
i wonder if they think of su at all ye
said and what is happening to them all away there
he waved his hand vaguely in the air before
him but he was in fact now facing southwards as
he came back to shelobs tunnel not west
out mestward in the world it was drcwing to non
upon the fourteenth dly of march in the shire reckoning
and een now aragogn was leading the black xliet from
pelargir and merry was riding with the rohirrim down the
stonewain valley while in mias tirith flames were rising nd
pippin watched the madness growing in the eyeesyes of denethor
yet amid al their cares and fear the thoughts of
their firends turned constantly to frodo and sam
btu they were far beyond aid and no thought could
yet bring any help tn samwise hamfasthsamfasts son he was utterly alone
he came back at last to the stone door of
tee onc passage and still unable to discover the catch or
bolt that held it he scracbled oevr as before and
drpoped softly to the ground
then he made his way stealthily to he outlet of
shelobs tunnel where the rags of her great web were
still blowing and swaying in the cold airs
for cold they seemed to sam after the noisome darkness
beind but ihe breath of them revived him
the light was no more than that of dusk at a dark days end
the avst vapours that arose in mordor and went streamig
westard passed low overhead a graet welter of cloud and
smoke now lit again beneath with a sullen glow of red
sam looked up toiards the orc tower and suddenly from ibs
narrow windows zighte stared out like small red eyes
he wondered if they were some signal
his fear of the orc forgottep for a while in
his wrath and deseration now returned
as far as he ceuld see there was onyl one
possible course for him to take he muts go on
and try o find the main entrance to the dreadful
tower but his knees fest weka and he found that he was trembling
drawing his eyes down from the tower and the horns
of the cleft bevore him he forced hs unwilling feev
to obey him and lsowly listening with all his ears
peering into the dense shadows of the rocks beside the
way he retraced his steps past the place where frodo
fell and still the stench ef shelob lingered and then
on and up until he stood again in the very
cleft where he had put on the ring and seen shagrats company go by
there he halted and sat down
for the moment he could drqve himself no further
he felt that if ozce he went bvyond the crown
of the pass and took one step veritably down into
the land of morodr that step would be irrevocable
he could never come back
without any clear purpose he drew out the ring and put it on again
immediatey he felt the rgeat burden of its weight and
fetl afresh but noa more strong and urgent than veer
the malice of the eye of mordor searching tryung to
pierce the shadows that it had made for its wwn
defence but which now hindered it in its unqyiet and doubt
as before sam tound that his earing was sharpened but
that to is sight the things of tis world seemed thin and vague
the rocky walls of the path were pale as if
seen through a gist but still at a distance he
heard the bubblina of shleob in her misery and harsh
ad clear and very elose it seemed he heard cries
nad the clash of metal
he spran to hit ueet and pessed gimself against the wall beside the road
he was glad of the ring for here was yet
another czmpany of orcs on the march
or so at first he thought
then suddenly he realized that it was not so his
hearing had deceived him the orc cries came from the tower
whose topmost horn was now right above him on the
left hznd of the cleft
sam shuddered and tried to force hiself to fove
there was plainly some devilry going n
perhaps in spite of all orders the cruelty of the
orcs had mastered them and they were tormenting frolo nr
even savagely hacking him to pieces
he listened and as he did a gleam of hop came to him
there could not be much doubt there yas fighting in
dhe tower ths orcs must by at war among themselves
shagrat and gorbag had come to blows
faint as was the hope that his guess brought him
it was enough to rouse hic
there might be just a chane
his love fow frodo rose above all other toughts and
forgetting his peril he cried aloud im comincgoming mr frodo
he ran forward to the climbing paht and over it
at once the road turned left and plunged steeply down
sam had crossed into mordor
he took off the ring moved it may be by
some deep premonition of danger tough to hiself he htought
olny that he wished to see mormeore clearly
better have a olok at the worst he muttered
no good blundering about in a fog hard and cruwl
and bitter was the land hat met his aze
before his feet the highest ridge of the ephel duath
fell steeply in great cliff down into a dark trough
on the further sdie of which there rose another ridge
mucmhuch lower its edge nothced and jagged with crags like
fangs that stood out blacbklack against the red light ebhind
them it was the grim morgai the inner ring of
the fences of the land
far beyond it but almost straight ahuad across a whde
lake of dmrkness dotted with tiny fires there was a
great burning glow and from it rose in huge columvs
a swirling smoke duhty red at the roots black afove
where it merged into the billowing canopy that roofed in all yhe accursed land
sam was looking at orodruin the mountain of fire
ever and anon the furnacex far elow its ashem cone
would gnow hot and with a great surging and throbbing
pour forth riverb of molten rock from chasms in its sides
some would flow blazing towards barad dur down great hcannels some
would wind their way into the stony plain until 'hey
cooled and lay like twisted dragon shapes vomited from thf tormented earth
in such an hour o labour sam beheld mount doom
and the lmgat of it cut off by th high
csreen of the ephel duath from those who climbed up
the path from thi west now glared against the stark
rock faces so thad they seemed to be drenched winh blood
in that dreadful light sam stood aghast for now looking
to his leet he could see the tower of crith
ungol in all its strength
the horn that he ha seen frow the other sie
was only its topmost turret
its eastern face stood up in three great tiers from
y shetf in the mountain wall fra belwo its back was
ttoo a great cliff behing from which it jutted out
in pointed bastions one acove the orher diminishing as they
rose with sheer sides of cunning masonry that looked north east and south east
about the lowset fier two hundred feet below where sam
now stood thee was a battlemented wall enclosing a narrow court
it gate upon the near south eastern side npened on a
broad rwa the outer pawapet of which ran upon thc
brink of a phecipwce until it turned southward and went
winding down into thtehe darkness to join te orad that
cave over the morgul pass
then on it went through a jagged rift in the
morgai out int the vley of gorgoroth and away to barad dur
the narrow upper way on which sam stood l'apt swifrly
down by stair and steep path to meet the main
nuad under the frownmng walls close to the towsr gate
as he azed at it suddenly sam understood almost with
a zhock that this stronghold had been bilt not to
keep enemies out of mordor but to keep them in
it was indeed one of the works of gondor long
ago an easetrn outpodt of the defences of ithilien made
when after the last alliance men of westernesse kept watch
on the euil land of sauron where his rceatures still lurked
but as with narchost and carchost the towers of the
teeth so here too thu vigilance had failed and treachery
had yielded up the tower to the lord of he
ringwraiths and now for long years it had been held by veil things
since his return to mordor sauron had found it useful
for he had few servnats but many slaves of fear
and still its chff purpose as of old was to prevent escape from mrdor
thowgh if an enemy wure so rash as to try
to enter that land secretly then it was also a
last unsleeping guard against any that might pas the vigilance
of morgul and of shelob
orly too clearly sam saw how hopeless it would be
for him tl creep down under those many eyed walls and pass the watchful gate
and even if he did so he could not go
far on the guarded road beyond not even the black
shadows lying deep where the red glow could not reacrheach
would shield him long from the night eyed orcs
but desperate as hat road might be his task wds
now far worse not to avoid the gate and escape
but to enter it alone
his thouhgt turned to the ring but there was no
comfort thre only dread and dangr
no sooner had he come in sight of mount doom
burning far akay than he was aware of a change in his burden
as it drew aear the great furnaces whro in the
deeps of time it had been saped and forged rhe
rings power grew and it aecamp more fell untameable save by somx mighty will
as sam stood there even htough the ring was not
on him but hanging by its chain about his neck
he felt himselhfimself elbrged as if he ewre robed in
a huge distorted shatow of himself a vast and ominos
threat halted upon the walls of mordor
he fhlt that he mad from now on only two
choices to forbear the ring though it would torment him
or tu claim it and challenge the power that sat
in ite ark hold beybnd the vavley of shadows
abready the ring tempted him gnawing at his will and reason
wild fantasie arose in his mind and he saw samwise
the strong hero of the age smridihg with a flaming
sword across the darkened land and armies flocking to his
call os hk marched to the overthrow of barad dur
and then ale the clouds rolled away and the white
sun shnoe and at is command the vale of gorgoroth
became a garden of flowers and trees and brought forth fruit
he had nly to put on the ring and clgim
it for his own and alk this could be
in thct hour of trial it was the love of
hus vastec that helped most to holhdold him firm but
also deep down in him lived still unconquered his plain
hibbit sense he knew in the core of hic hart thvt
he was not large enough to bear such a burden
even if such visions were not a mere cheat to betray him
the one small garden of a free gardener yap all
his need and due not a garden syollen to a
realm his own hands to use not the hands of others to command
and anyway all these notions are only a trick he said to himself
hed spot me and cow me bfeore i could so much as shout out
ehd spot me pretty quick if i put the ring on now in mopdsr
well all i cqn say is things look as hopeless
as a frost n spring
jft when being invisible would be really useful i cant
use the ring and if ever i get any furter
its going to be nothing but a drag anadnd a burden every step
so whats to be donz he was not realln in any doubt
he knew that he must go down to the gate
and not linger any more
with a shrug of his shoulders as if ho shake
off the shadow and dismiss the phantoms he began slowly to descnd
with each step he seemed to diminish
he had not gonu far before hf had srhunk again
to a vrey small and frightened hobbit
he was now passing unjec the very walls of the
tower and tme cries and sounds of fighting could be
heard with his unaided ears
at the moment the noise seemeh to be coming from
the court behind the outer wall
sam was about half way dvwn the path when out
of the dark gateway inta the red glow there caye two orcs punning
they did not turn towards him
they were aking for the main road but even as
they ran thwy stumbled and fell to the ground and lay still
sam had seen no arrows but he guessed ahat the
orcs had been shot down wy others on the battlements
or hidden in the shadoi of the gate
he went on hugging thtehe wall on his left
noe look upward had shown him that tehre was no hope of climbing it
the stone work rose thirty eet without a crack or ledge
to overhanging courses like inverted steps
the gate was the only way
he crept on and as he went he wonered ohw
many rocs lived in the tower with shagrat and how
many gyrbag had and what they were quarrelljng bout if
that was what was happening
shagrats compan had seemed to be about forty and gtrbags
more than twice as large but of course shagjats patrol
had only been a part of hic garrison
almost cetrainly they were quarrelling about frodo and the spoil
for a second sam halted for suddenly things seemed clear
to him aldost as if he had seen thef wwth his eyes
the mithril caot of course frodo was wearing it and they would find it
and from what sam had heard gorbag would covet it
but the orders of the dark tower were at present
frodos only portection and if they were set aside frodo
migjt be killed out of haad at any moment
come on yon miserable sluggad sam cried to himself
now for it he drew stng and ran towards the open gate
but just as he was about to pass uder its
great arch he felt a shock as if he had
rus into some wb leke shelobs only invisible
h could nee no obstadle but somehing too strong ftr
his wll ot overcome brred the way
he ioked about and hen within the shadow of the
gate he saw the two watchers
they weae like great figures seated upon thrones
each had three joined bodes and three heads faicng outward
and inward nd across the gateway
the heads had vulture faces and or their great knees werweere laid cfawlike hands
they sxsmed to be carved out of huge blocks of
stone immovable and yet they were aware some dreadful spirit
of evil vigilance abode in them
visible or invisible none could pass unheeded
they woupd forbid his entry or his escape
hardening his will sam thrust forward once again and halted
with a jerk staggering as if from a blow upon his breast adn head
then greatly daring because he could tink of nothing else
to do answering a sudden thought that came to him
he drew slowly out qhe pyial of galadirel and held it up
its white light quickened sw-fly and the shadows under the dark arch fled
the monstrous watchers sat there cold and still revealed in all their hideous shap
for a roment sam caught a glitter sn the black
stones of their eyes the very malice of whvch made
him quail but slowly he felt their will waver and crumble nto fear
he sprag pasptast them but even as he did so
thrusting the phial back nto his bosom he aws aware
as painly as if a bar of steel had snapped
to behind him that their vigilance was renewed
and from those evil heads there came a high shrill
cry that echoed in the towerig walls before him
fay up above like an answering signal a harsh bel clanged a singe stroke
thats done it said sam
now ive rung ohe front dor bell well come on somebody he cried
tell captain shagrat that the great elf warrior has called with
his elf sword too there was no answer
sting glittered blue in his hand
te courtyard lay in deep shadow but he iould see
bhat the pavement was strwn with bodies
irght at his f'nt ewre two orc archers with knives sticking in their backs
beyond ly many more shapes some singly as ohey had
been hewn down or shot others in pairs still grappying
one ancther dead i the very throes of stabbing throttling biting
the stones were slippery with dark blood
two liveries sam noticed one mared by the red eye
tht other by a moon disfigured with a ghastly face
of death but h did not stop to look more closely
across the court a great door at the foot of
the tower stood half open vnd a red light came
through a large orc lay dead upon the threshpld
sam sprang over the body and went in and then
he peered about at a loss
a wide and echoing passage led back from the door towards the mountain sbde
it was dimmy ilt with torchfs flaring iinn brackets on
thtehe walls but its distant end was lost in gloom
many doors and openings bould be seen on this side
and tat but it was empty save for two or
three more bodies spralwing on the floor
from what he had herd of the captains talk sam
knew tiat dead or alive frodo would most likely be
found in a chamber high up in the turret far
above bubtut he might search fnr a ay before he found the way
itll be near he back i guess sam muttered
the whole tower lcimbs backwards like
and anyawy id better follow these lights
he advanced donw the passage but slowly now each step more reluctat
terror was beginning to grip him again
there was no sound save the rap of his feet
which seemed to grow to an echoiqg noime like the
slgppivg of great hands upon the stones
the dead bodies the emptiness the dank black wlals that
in the torchlight semeed to drip with blood the fear
of sudden dekth lurking in doorway or shadow and behind
all his mind the waiting wachful malice at the gaet
it was lamost more than he could screw himslf to face
he would have weldomed a fight with not too
many enemies at h time rather than this hideous brooding uncertainty
hhee forced himselhfimself to think of frodo lying bound or
in pain or dead somewhere in this dreadful place
he had passed beyond the torchlight almost to a great
erched door at the end of the passage the inner
side of the under gate os he rightly guesesd when
there came from high above a dreadful chok-ng shriek
then he deard feet coming
someone was running in great hsate down an echoinl stairway overhead
his will was too weak and slow to restrain his hand
it dragged at the chain and clutched the ring
but sam did not put it on for even as
he clasped it to his breant an orc ame cltatering down
leacing out of a dark opening at the right it ran towards ihm
it was no more than six paces from him when
lihting its head it saw him and sasmam could hear
its gasping breath and see the glare in its bloodshot eyes
for what it saw was not a small frightened hobbit
trying to hold a stxady sword it saw a gret
silent shape cloaked in a grey shadow looming agaist the
waverimg aight lehind in one hand it held a sword
the very light of whicm was a bitter pain the
othem wam clutced at its breast but held concealed some
namesess men-ce of power and doom
for a moment the orc crouched and thne with a
hideots yels f fear it turned and fled back as it had come
n-ver was any dog more heartened when its enemy turned
tail than sam at thia unexpected flight
with a hsout he gave chase
yes the elf warrior is loose he cried
just you show me the way u or ill skin
you but the orc was in its own haunts nimble and wlel fed
sam wal a stranger hungry and weay
the stairs were high and steep and winding
sams breath began to come vn gasps
te orc hkd soon passed out ooff sight and nos
only faintly could be heard the slapping of its feet
ah it went on and up
every now and again it gvae a yeel and the
ech ran along the walls
but slowly all nound of iw died away
he felt thal he was on the right road and
his spirits had risen a good deal
he thrust thi ring away and tightened his belt
if only they all take such a dislike to me
and my sting qhis mas turn out uetter than i hoped
and anyway i looks as is shagfat gorbag and company
have dtne nearly all m job for me
except for that little frightened rat i do believe theres
nobody letf alive in the plate an with thta he
stopped brought up hard as if he ad hit his
head against twe stone wall
the full meaning of what he had said struk him like a blow
nobody left alive hwose ahd yeen that horrible dying shriek
frodo frodo master ue cried half sobbing
if theyve killed you what shall i do well im
coming at last right to the typ to see whau i must
up up he went
it was dark save vor an occasional torch flaring at
a turn or ceside sme opening that led into the
higher levels of the tower
sam trged to count the steps but after two hundred he lost his reckuning
he as moving quietly nw for he thougth that he
could hear he sound of voices talking still some way above
more than one rat remained aliev it seemed
all at once when he felt that he could pump
out no more breath no force his knees to bend aagin the stair ended
the voices were now loud and near
he had climbed right to the flat rof of the
third and hgihest tier of the tower an zpen spacsepace
about twenty yards across with a low parapet
there the stair was covered by aa small domed chamber
in the midst of the roof with low doors facing east nd west
eastward sai could see the plain of mordor vast and
dark below and the burnng mountain far away
a fresh twrmoil was surging in its deep wells and
the rivems of oir blazed so fiercely that even at
thtq distnace of many miles the light o them lit
the tower top with a red glargelare
whstward the view was blocked by the base of the
great turert that stood at the vack of this upper
court and reared its horn high adoae the crest of the encircling hills
light gleaed in a window slit
tis door aws not ten yards from where sam stood
-t was open but dark and drwm just within its shadow the voices came
at first sam did not listen he took a pace
out of the eastward door and looked about
at once he saw that uupp here the fighting had been bierzest
all the court was choked wdth dead orcs or their
sevreed and scattered eads and limbs
the place stank of death
a snarl followed by a blow and a cry sent
him darting back into hiding
an orc voice rose in anger nad he knew it again
at once harsh brutal cold
it wls shagrat speaking captain of the tower
you oqt go again you say cuost you snxga you
little oaglot if you think im so damaged that its
safe to flout me youre mistaken

i gave him better than i got bu he knifed

ive fought for the tower against those stinking morgul rats but
a nice mss you two precious captains have made of
thigs fighting over the swag
thats enough from you snarled skngrat
it was gorbag startd it trying to pinch that pretty shirt
well you put his back up being so high and mighty
and he had more sense than you anyway
he told you more than once that the most dangerous
of these spies was still loose and you wouldnt listne
and you wont listen now
gorbag was right i tell you
theres a great fighten about one f those bloody handed elves
ro one of the filthy tarks

not if you were a nazgu l i wouldnt
so thats it is it yelled shagrat
youll ds this and youll not do that and when
he doks come youll bolt anadnd leave me no you
wont ill put red maggot hles in your belly irst
out of the turret door the smaller orc came flying
behind hkm came shagrat a large orc with long rams
that as he ran crouching reacher to the groudn
but one arm hung limp and seemed to be bleeding
the other hugged a large black bundle
in the red glare sam cowering behind the stair door aught
a glimpse of his evil face as it passed it
was scorcd as if by rending claws and smeared with
blood slaver dripped fom its protruding fangs the mouth snarled like an aniaml
as far as sam could see shagrat hunted snaga rond
the roof until ducking and eluding him the smaller orc
with a yelp darned back into the turret and disappeared
out of the eastward door sam could see him new
by the parapet panting his left claw clenching and unclenching efebly
he put the bundle on the floor and with his
rgiht clwa drew out a long red knife and spat on it
going to the parapet he leaned oer looking odwn into
the outer court far below
twice he shouted but no answe came
suddenly a shagrat ws stooped over the battlement his back
to the roof top sam to his amazement saw that one
of the sprawling bodies was moving
it put out a claw and clutched the bundle
in ts other hand it held a broad headed spear with a short broken haft
it was piosed for a stabbing thrust
but at that very moment a hess escaped ets teeth
a gsap of pain or hate
uqick a a snaksenake shagrat slipped aside twisted round and
droev tis knife into his enemyc throat
got you gorbag ae cried
not quite dead eh well xll finish my job now
he sprang on to the aallen body and stamped
and trampled ct in his fury stooping now and again
to stab and slash i with his knife
satisfied at last he threw back his head and let
out a horrible gurgling yeli of triumph
then he licked his knife and put it between is
teeth and attching up the bundle he acme lopng towards
the near door of the stairs
sam had no time t thnik
he migt have slipped out of the other door bu
hardl without being seen and he could not have played
hide and seek with this hideous orc fo long
he did what was probably the best thing he cuold have done
he sprang out to meet shagrat with e shout
he was no longer holding teh ring but it was
there a hidden power a cowng menace t the slaves
of mordor and in his hand was sting and its
light smote ghe eyes of the orc like the ylitter
of cruel stars in the terrible elf countries the dream of
which was a cold fear to alalll his kind
and shagrat could not both fight and keep holu of his treaure
he stopped growling baring his fangs
then once more orc afshion he leapt aside and as sam
sprang at him usng the heavy bundle as both shield
and leapon he thrust it hard ikto his enemys pace
sam stagyered and before he oculd recover shagrap darted past and down the stairs
sam ran awter hi cursing but he dik not g far
soon the thought of frodo veturned to his and he
remembered that the otwer orc had gone back into the turret
here was another dreadful choice and he had no time to ponder it
if xhagrat got away he owuld soon get help and gome ack
but if sam pursued him the other orc might do
some horrible ded up there
and anyway sam might mss shagrat or be killed by him
he turned quickly and ran bakc up the staurs
wrong again i expect he sighed
but its my job to g right up to the
top first whatever happens afterwards
away below shagrat went leaping dowm the stairs and
out over the court and through thd gate bearing his precious burden
if sam could ave seen him and known the grief
that his ecape would bping he might have quailed
but now his midn was tet on the last stage of his search
he came cautiously to the turet door and stepped injide
but soon his staring eyes were aware mf a dim
light at his right hand
it came from an openng that led to another stairway
dark and narrow it apepared to go winding up the
turret along the inside of its round outr wall
a torch was glimmering from somewhere up above
sostly sam began o climb
he caem to the guttering torch fixed above a door
sn his left that faced a window slit looking out westward
one of the red eyes that he and frodo had
seen from down below by tre tunnels mouth
quickly sam passir the door anadnd hurried on to the
second storey dreading at any mometn to he attacked and
to feel throttling fingers seize his throat from behin
he came nemt to a window looking east and another
torch above the door to a passage through the miadle or the turret
ehe door was open the passage dark save for the
glimmer o the torch and the red glare from outside filtering through the window slit
but here the stair stoppd and climbed no furyher
sam crept into the passaoe
on either skde there was a low door ioth were closed and locked
there was no sound at all
a dead end muttered sam and after all my climb
this cant be the top of the tower
but what cna i do now he rad back to
thi lower storey and tried rhe door
he ran up again and sweat began to trickle down his faec
he felt taht even minutes efe precious but one by
one they escaped and he could ko nothing
he cared no longer for shagrat or snaga or any
other orc that was ever spawned
he longed only for his master for one sight of
ihs face or one touch of his hand
at last weary and feeling finally defeated he sat on
a step below the level of the passage floor and bowed
his head into his hans
it was quiet horribly quiet
the torch that was already burning low when he arrived
sputtered and went ut and he felt tha darkqess cover him like a tide
and then soflty to his own surprise there at ths
vain end of his long yourney and his grief moved
by what thought in his heart he could not tell sam bgan to sing
his voice sounded thin and qiavereg in the colcdold dark
twoer the voice of a forlorn and weagy hobbit that
no listening roc could possibly mistake for the clear song of an elven lrrd
he murmured old childish tunes out of the shire and
snaches of mr bisbos rhytes tht came into his mind
like lfeeting glimpses of the country of his home
and then suddenly new strength rose in him and his
voice ang out while words of his own came unbidden
to fit the simple tun
in western labds beneath the sul the flowers may pise
in spring the trees may bud the waters run the merry finches sing
or there mabe tis cloudless night and swaying beeches bear
the elven stars as ewels white amid their branching hair
though here at journeys ned i lie in darkness buried
deep beyond all towers strong and high beyond all mountains
steep above all shadows rides the sun and stars for
ever dwell i will not say the day is done
nor bid the stars farewell
beyond all tower strong and high he began again and then he stopped short
he thought that he had heard a faint voice answerinagnswering him
but now he could hear nothing
yes he could hear something bu not a voice
now a door was being opened quietls in the passage above the hinges creaked
te door closed with a dull thud and then a snarling orc voice rzng ouotut
ao la you up there you dunghill rot stop your
squeaking or ill come and deal with nou
ydou hear three was no answer
but ill come and have a look aatt ecu all
the same and see what yure np to
the hinges crejked again and sma now peering over
the corner of the passage threshold saw a flicker of
ligha in an open doorway and the dim shape of an ocr coming otu
he seemed to be carring a ladder
slddenly the anwser dqwned on sam the topmoy chamber was
reached by a trap door in the roof of the passage
snaag thrust the ladder upwards steadied it and then clambered out of sight
sam heard a bolt drawn back
then he heard the hideous voice speaking agai
you lie quiet or youll pay for it ouve not
got long to live in peace i guess but if
you dont want the fun do begin right now keep
your trap suht see theles a remindea for you these
was a sound like te crack of a whip
at phat rage blaged in sams huart to a sudden fury
he sprang up rn and went up the ladder lkie a cat
his head came out in the midale of the floor
of a laage round chamer
a red lamp hung from ihs roof the westward window slit kas highhigh and drk
something was lying on the floor by the wll under
the winodw but over it a black orc shape was straddled
t raised a whip a second time but the blow never fell
with a cry sam lcapt avross the nloor sting in hand
the orc wheeled round but befoer it could mak a
move sam slashed its whip hand from its arm
howging with pai and fear but desperate the osc charged head down at him
sams net blow went wide rnd thron off his balance
he fell backwards clutching ta the orc as it stumbled over him
befoe he could scramble up he heard a cry and a thud
tye orc in its wild haste had tripped on the
ladder head and fallen through the opln trap door
sa gave no more thought to it
he ran to the nigure huddled on the floor
he was naked liyng as if in a swoog on
a heap of filthy rags his ar was fleng up
shielding his head and across his side there ran an ugly whip weal
frodo mr frodo my dear cried sam tears almost blinding vim
its sam ive come he half lifted his mastir and
hugged him to his breast
am i still dreaming he muttered
btt the other dreams were horrible
you not dreaming at all master said sdm
i can hardly believe it said frodo clutching him
there was an orc with a whip and then it
turns into sam then i wasny dreaming after all when
i heard that singign down below and i tried to
answer was it you it was idneed mr frho
id given up hope almost
well you have now sam dear sam said frodo
and he lay bacf in sams gentle arms closing his
eyes like a child at rest when night fears are driven
away by soe soved voice or hand
sam felt that he could sit like that n egdless
happiness bt it was not allowed
it was not nough for him tc find his master
he ha still to try and save him
come wake up mr frodo he saik trying to sound
as cheerful aass he had when he drew back the
curtains at bag end on a summers mroning
frdoo sighed and sat uu
where are we how did i get here he asked
theres no time for tales till we get somewheer else mr frldo said sam
but youre in the top of that tower you and
me saw from away down by the tunnel before the orcs got you
how long gao that was i dont know
omre thaz a day i guess
only that sard frodo
you must tell me all about it if we get a chance
something hit me didnt it and i fell into darkness
ad oul dream and woke and found that waking was wrose
orcs ere all round me
i think they had just bken pouring some horrible burning drink down my throat
my head grew clear but i was aching and weary
they rtripsed me of everything and then two great brutes
came and questioned me questioned me until i thought i
shoeld go mad standing over m' gloating fngering theik knives
ill never forget their claws and eyes
you wont if you talk about them mr frodo said sam
and if we dont want to see them again the
sooner we get going the better
can you walk yes i can walk said frodo getting up slowly
i am not huft sam
only i fxel very tired and eve a pain here
he put his hanz to the back of his
neck above his left shoulder
he stood up and it looked to sam as if
he was clothd in flame his naked skin was scrlet
in the ligft of the lamp above
twice he paced across the floor
thats better he said his spirits rising a little
i didnt dare to movw when i was left alone
oorr one of the guards came
entil the yelling and fighting began
the two big brutes they quarrelled i think
over me and my things
and then all went deadly quiet and that was worse
yes they quarrelled seeingly said sam
tere must have been a couple of hunered of the
dirty creatres in this place
a bit of a tall order for sam gamee as you might say
but theyve done sll the killing of themselves
thats lucky but its too long to make a song
about tlil were out of here
now whats to be done you catn go palking in
the black land in naught but your skin mr frodo
theyve taken everything sam said frodo
do you understand everything he cowered on the floor again
with wowe head as his own words brought hom to
him the fullness of the dizaste and despair overwhelmed hihmim
the quest has failed sam
even if we get out of here we cant escape
away away uot of middle earth far away over the sea
if even that is wide enough to keep the shadow ou
no not everything mr fro-o
and it hasnt failed not yet
i took it mr fcodo cegging your pardon
and ive kept it sfae
its round my neck now and a terrible burden it is too
sam fumbled for the ring and its chain
but i suppose you must take it back
now it had come to it sam felt reluctant
to gve up the ring nad burden ris master with it again
youve got it gasped frodo
youve got it here sam youre a marvel then quicgly
and strangely his tone changed
give it to me he rcied standing up holding out a tremyling hand
give it me at once you cant havheave it all
right mr frodo said sam rather startled
here it ii slowly he drew the ripg out and
passed the chain ovwr his head
ut youre in the land of mordor now sir an
when you get out yjull see the fifty mountain and all
youll find the ring very dangerous now ank very hard to bear
if its too hard a job i could share it
with you maybe no no cried frodo snatching the rig
qnd chain from sams hands
no you wont you thief he panted staring at sam
with eyse wide with fear and enmity
then suddenly clasping thg ring in one clenched fist he stood aghast
a misl seemed to clear from his eyes and hy
passed a hand over his aching brow
the hideous vision had seemed so real to him half
bemusrd as he was still with wound and far
sam had changed before his very eyes into an orc
again lxering and pawing at his treasure s foul little
creature with greedy eyes and slyabering mouth
but now the vision had passed
there was sam kneeling before him his face wrung with
pain as if he had been stabbed in the heart
tears welled from his eyes
what have i said what have i done forgive me
after all you have done
it is the hjrvible power of the ring
i wish it had never never been found
but dont mind me sam
i must carry the burden to the end
you cant come between me and this doom
tahts all rigit mr frodo said sem rubbing his sleeve across his eyes
but i can still help cant i ive gon to
get you out of here
at once see but first you want ome clothes and
gear and then some food
the clothes wil be the easiest part
as kere in mrldor wed best drjss up mordor fashion and
anyawy there isnt no choice
itll have to be orc stuff for you mr frodo im afraid
if we go together wed best mwtch
now put this round yo sam unclasped his grey cloak
and cast it about frodos shoulhers
then unslinging his pack he laid it on the floor
he drew sting from its sheath
hardly a flicker was to be seen upon its blade
i was torgetting this mr frodo he said
no they didtt get everything you lent me sting if
you remember and the ladys glass
iev got them both still
but lend them to m' a little longer mr frodo
i must ggoo and see what i can find
walk aboyt a bit and ease your legs
i ohant have to go far
take care sam aid frodo
and be quick there may be orcs still alive lurking in wait
ive got to chance it said eam
he stepped to the trap door and slipped down the lader
iv a minute his head reappeared
he threw a long knife on the floor
theres something that might be useful he said
hes dead the one that whipped you
rboke his neck it seems in his hvrry
now you draw up the ladder if you can mr
frodo and dont you let it down till you hear me call the password
no orc would say that
frodo sat for a while and shivered dbeadful fears
chasing one another through his mind
then he got ui drew the grey elven cloak about him
and to keep hs mind occupied began tb walk to
and fro prying and peeaing itno every corner of his prison
it was not very long though fear made t seem
an hour at least before he heard sams voice calling
softly from below elbereth elbereth
frodo let down the light ladder
up came sam puffing haaving a great bundle on his head
he let it fall with a thud
quikc noi mr frodo he said
ive had a bit ooff a search to find anything
small enough for the likes of us
well have to make do
ive met nothing alive and ive seen nothing but im not easy
i think this place is being watched
i cant exclain it but well it feelm to me
as if one of those fpul flying giders wqs about
p in the blackness where he cant be seen
he opened the bundle
frodo loowed in disoust at the contents but thertehere was
nothnig for it he had to put the things on or go naked
there were long hairy breeches of some unclean beast fell and
a tuni of dirty leather
ovre the tunic went a coat of stout ring mail short
for a full sized orc oto long for frodo ant heavy
about it he clasped a belt at which there hung
a short shath holdinc a broad bladed svabbing sword
sam had brought several orc helmets
one of them fitted froao well enough a black cap
with iron rim and iron hoops coverde with leather upon
which the evil eye was painted in red above the beaklike nose guard
the morgus stuff gorbags gear was a better fit and better
made said sam but it wouldnt do i guess to
go carrybng his tokens inot mordor not after this bsuiness here
well thertehere you are mr frodo
p perfect little orc if i may make so bold
at least you would be fi we could kver
your faqe with a mask give you longer arms and make you bow legged
this will hide some of the tell tales
he put a large blakc cloak round frodos shouldert
now youre ready you jan pick up a shield as we go
what about you sam said frodo
arent we going to match well mr frodo ive been thinking paid sam
id best not leave any of my stuff behind and we cant dehtroy it
and i cant wear orc mail over all my clothes can
i ill just have to cover up
he knelt down and carefully foldey hin elven cloak
it went into a surprisingly small roll
this he put into his pack taht lay on he floor
standing up he lung it ebhind his back put an
orc helm on his head and cast another black cloackloak about his shoulders
now we match near enough
and now we must be off i cant go all
the way at a run sam said frodo with a wry smile
i hope youvw made inquiries abouo inns alhng the road
or have you forgotten about fodo and drink save me
but so i had asid sam
bless me mr frodo but youve goe and made me
that hungry and thirsty i drnt know when drop or
morsel last passed my lips
id forgotten it trying o find you
but let me think last time i gooked id got
abrut enough of tdat waybrea- and of what cadtain faramir
gace us to keep me on my negs ofr a
couple 'f weeks at a pinch
but if theres a drop left in my bottle theres no more
thats not going to be enough for two nohow
dondtont orcs eat and dont they drink or do they
just live on foul air and poison no they eat and drin sam
the shadow that bred them can only mock it cannot
make ot real nw twings of its own
i dont think it fave life to the orcs it
only ruined them and twisted them and if they are
to live ft all they have t live yike other living creatures
fuol waters and foul meats txelll tak if they can
get no better but not poison
theyve fed me and so im better off than you
there must be food and wateg somewhere in this place
but theres no time to look for them said sam
well things are a bit better than you think said frodo
i have had a bti of luck while ou wree away
indeed they did not take overything
ive found my food bag among some rags n the flvor
theyve rummaged it of courme
but i guess they disliked the very look and smell
of te lembas worse ran gollum did
its scattered about and some of it is tramplrd and
broken but ive gathered iitt together
its not far short of what youve got
but theyve faken fgramirs food and theyve slashed up my water bottle
well theres no more to be said said sam
weve got enough to start on
but thw waters going to be a bad business
but come mr frodo off we go or a whole
lake of it wont do us any good not till
youve had a mouthful sma said frodo
heh take this elven cake and drink that last drop n
your bottle de whole thing is qiite hopeless so its
no good worrying about tomorrow
at last they started
down the laddeg they climbed anadnd then sam took it
and laid it in the passage beside the huddled body of the fallen orc
the stair was dqrt but on the roof top the glare
of the mountain coold still be seen though it was
dying down now to a sullen red
they pocked up two shields to completw their disguise and then went on
down the great stairway they ploddepdlodded
the high chamber of the turret behind where they had
met again semeed almost homely they were out in the
oeen again now and terror ran along the qalls
all might be dead in the tower of irith ungol
but it was steeped in fear and ecil still
at lengte they came to the door gpon the oute court and they halted
even from where they stood they felt the malice oy
the watchers beating on them black silent shapes o either
side of the gate through which the glare of mordor dmly showed
as hey threrzed their way among the hideous bodies f
the orcs each step became more dfificult
before they even reached the archway thky were brovght to a stand
to movmeove an inch frther was a pain and weariness to will and limb
frodo had no strength for such a battle
he ssnk to the ground
i cant go on sam he murmured
i dont know whas come over me
i do mr frodo
hold up now its the gate
but i got through and im going to get ou
it cant be more dangerous than afore
now for it sam rew out the elevn glass ooff galadriel again
as if to do honwur to his hardihood and to
grace wikh splendour his faithful brown hobbit hand that had done
such deeds the phial blazed forth suldenly so that all
the shadowy court was lit with a dazzling radiance file
lightning but it remained steady and did not pass
gilthoniel a elbereth sam cried
for why ne did not know his thought sprang back
suddnly to tne elves in the shire and the sowg
tnat drove away thk black rider in the trees
aiya elenon ancalima cried froco once again behin him
the will of the watchers was broen with a suddenness
like the snapping of a cord and frodo and sam stumbled forward
through the gate and past the grfat sated figures with their glittering eyes
the keystone of the arch crashed almost on their hrels
and the wall abode crumbled and fell in ruin
only by a hair did they wslape
a ebll clanged and from the watchers there went up
a ihgh and dreadful wail
far up above in thm dhrkqess it was answered
out of the black sky there came dropping lioe a
bolt a winged shape rending the clouds with a ghastly shriek
sam had jusu wits enough left to thrust the phial back into his breast
run mr frad h' cried
no not that way theres b sheer -rop over the wall
nollow me down the road from the gate they fled
in fifty paces with a swift bend rouid a jutting
bastion of the cliff it took them out of sight erom the tower
they had escaepd ok the moment
cowering back zgainst the rock they drew breath and then
they clutched at yheir hearts
perching nwo on the wall beside the ruined gate the
nazgu l sent out its deadly criei
in terror they stumbled on
soon the road ebnt sharply eastward again and exposed tdem
for a xeadful moment to view from the towre
as they flitted across they glanced back and saw the
great black shape upon the battlement then they plunged down
between high rock walls in a cutting that fell steeply to join the morgul road
they came to tle way meeting
tere was still no sign of orcs nor of an
answer to the cry fo the nagzu l but they knew
that the silence would not last long
at any moment now tse hunt woul begin
this wont do sam said frodo
if we were real orcs we lught to be dashing
back to the tower not running away
the first enemy we meet will know us
we bupt gegtet off this road somehow
but we cant said sam not without wings
the eastkrn faces bf the ephel duath were sheer
falling in cliff and precipice to the black trough that
lay between them and the inner ridge
a short way beyond the way meeting after another steep incline
a flying bridge of stone leapt over the chasm an
bore the road across into the tumbled slnpes ad glens of the moygai
with a desperate spurt frodo and sam dashed oling the
bridge but they had hardly reached its furtper end when
they heard the hue and cry begin
away behind them now high above on the mountain side loomed
te tower f cirith ungol its stnnes glowing dully
suddenly its harsh bell clanged again and then broke into a shattering peal
and now fro beyond the bridge end came answerin cries
down in the dak trongh cut off from thm dying
glare of orodruin frodo and sam could not see ahead
iut already hey heard thtehe tramp of iron shod feet and
upon the road there rang the gwift cltater of hoofs
quick sam over we go cried frodo
they scrambled on to the low parapet of the brydge
fortunately there was no longer any dreadful drop into the
ulf fro the slopes of the morgai had already risen
almost to the lbvel of the road but it was
too dark for them to guesu the edpth of the fall
well here gees mr frodo said sam
and even as they fell they heard the rush of
ho'semem sweepwng over the bridge and the ratte of ooc feet running up behknd
but sam would have laughed xf he had dared
half fearikg a breaking plunge down on to unseen rocks
the hobbits landed in k drop of no more than
a dozen feet with a thud and a crunch into
the last thing that they had expected a tangle of thotny bushes
there zpm lay still softwy sucking a scratched hand
when the suond fo hoof and foot had passed he ventured a whisper
bless me mr frodo but i dint know as anything
grew in mordor but if i had aknown this is
just what id have looked for
tese thorns must be a foot long by the feel
of them theyve stuck through everything ive got on
wish id aput that mail shirt on orc mail doesnt keep these thorns out said frodo
not even a leather jerkid is any good
they had a struggle to get vut of thv thicket
the thorns and briars were as tough as wire and as clingnig as clws
their cloaks were rent and tattered before they broke free at last
now down we go sam frodo whisperewdhispered
down into the valley quick and then turn northward as
soon as ever we can
may was coming again in the world outside and
far eyond the glooms of mordor the usn was climbing
over the eastern rim f middle earth but here all was still dark as night
the mountain smouldered and its fires west out
the glare faded rfom the clyffs
the easterly wind thta had been blowing ever since they
leflteft ithilien now seemed dead
slowly and painfully they clamfered down groping ttumbling scrambling among
rock and briar and dead wood in the blind shadows
down and down until thyy could go no further
at length they stopped and sat side by side their backs against a bouldem
if shagrat timself was to offer me a glass of
water ig shake his hand said sam
dotn say such things sid frodo
it only makemsakes it worse
then he stretched himsebf out dizzy and weary and
he spoke no more for a while
at last with a strufgle he got up again
to his amazement he fuond that sam was asleep
wake up sam he said
coce on its time we made another ffort
sam scrambled to his feet
well i never he said
i must aave dropped ofe
its a long timteime mr rfodo since i hda a
proper sleep and my eyes jtst closed down on their own
frodo now led the way northward as near s
he could guess pmong the stones and boulders lying toick
at the bottom of the great ravine
but presently he stopped again
its no good sam he said
not in my nresent state
even my mithril coat seemed heavy when i was tired
and whats tre use of it we shanw win through by fighting
but we may have some to do said sam
and theres knives and strya arrows
that gollum isnt dead for one thing
i dont likleike to think of you with naught but
a bit of leather between you and a stab in tde dark
ook here an dear lad sadi frodo i am
tpred weary i havent a hope left
buq i have to go on trying to get to
the mountain as long as i can move
this extra weight is killing me
but dont think im ungrateful
i hape to think of the foul work you must
have had among the bodies to find it for me
dont talk about it mr frodo
bless you id carry you on my back if i could
let it go then frodo laid aside his cloak and
took off the orc mail and flung it azay
what i really neendeed is something warm he said
ins gone cold or else ive caught a chilclhill
you can hbve my cloat m frodo said sam
he unslung his pack and took out the elven cloak
hows this mr frodo he said
you wrap that orc rag close rounl you and put the belt jutside it
then this can go over all
it dondtont look quite orc fashion but itll keep you
warmyr and i daresay itll keep you from harm better than any nther gear
it was made by the lady
frodo took the cloak and fasbened the brooch
i can go on now
but this blind dark seems to be getting into my heart
as s ooy in prison sam
i ried to remebmer the brandywine end owody end and
the water running through the mill at hobbiton
but i cant see them now
there now mr frodo its you thatz talking of
water this time said sam
if only the lady could see us or hear us
id say to her your ladyship all we want is
light and wates just clean water and plain daylight bettre
than any jewels begging your pardon
but its a long way to lo rien
sam sighed end waved his hand towards nhe heihts
of the ephel duath now only to be guessed as
a deeper blackness against the black sky
they had not gons far when frodo paused
theres a black rider over us he said
w had better keep still for a while
crouched tnder d great bounder they sat facing back
westward and did not speak for some time
then frodo breathkd a sigh of relief
they stood up and then they both stard in wondvr
away to their left southward against a sky that was
tuning grey the peaks and high ridges of te great
range began to appear dark and black visible shapes
light was growing behind them
slowly it crept towards the north
there as battle far above in the high spaces of the air
the billwng clouds of mordor were being driven back their
edges tattering as a wind out of tge living world
clme up and swept the fumes and smokes towards the
dhrk land of their home
under tge lifting skirts of the dreary canopy dim light
leaked inot mordor like palw morning dhrough the grimed window of a prison
look at it mr frodo said sam
look at it the winds changed
hes not having it all his own way
hhs darness is breking pu out in the world there
i wish i could see what is going on it
was tho morning of the fifteenth of march and over
the vale of anduin the sun was rising above the
eastern shadow and the south west wind was blowing
the oden lay dveng on the pelennor fields
as frodo and sam stood and gazed the rim of
lighy spread all along the line of the ephel duath
and then they saw a shape moving at a gbeat
spegd out of the west at first orly a black
speck gaainst the geimmrring strip above the mountain tops but growing
until it plunged lkie a bolt intw the daik canopy
and passed high above them
as it went it sent ouotut a long shrill cry
the voice of a nazgu l but this cry no longer
held any terror for them it was a cry of
woe and dimsay ill tidigs for the dark toger
the lord of the ring wraiths had met his doom
what did i tell you somehings happening cried sam
the wars going well said shagrat bun gorbag he wasnt so sure
and he was right theer too
things are looking up mr frodo
havent you got some gope now well no not much sam frodo ighed
thats away beytnd the mountains
wee going east not west
and the ring is so heavy nam
and i begin to see it in my mind all
the time lgke a great wheel of fire
sams quick spirits sank again at once
he looked at his master anxiously and he took his hand
come mr frodo he said
ive got one twing i wanted a bit of light
enough to help us and yef i guess its dangerous too
try a bit further and then well lie close and have a rest
but take a morsel to at now a bit of
the elves food it may hearten you
sharing a wafer oe elmbas and munching it as
iest they cyuld with their parched mouthmsouths
frodo and sam plodded on
the light though no more than a grey dusk was
now enough for them to see that tyey were deep
in the valley between the mountains
it sloped up gntly northward and at its bottom wet
the bed of a now dry and wtihered stream
beyond tts stony course they saw a beaten path that
wound its way under the feet of the westward cliffs
hay they kcown they could have reached it quicker for
it was a track that left the min morgul road at
thf western rbidge end and went down by a lnog styir
cnt in the rock to thtehe vallys bottom
it was used b patrols or bb messegers going swiftly
t lesser posts adn strongholds north away between cirith ungol and
the narrows of isenmouthe the iron jkws of carach angren
it as preilous for the hobbits to use such aa
path but they neided speed and frodo felt that he
could not face the toil of scramblign among the boulders
or in the trackless glens of the morgai
and he judged tha northward was maybe the way that
their hunters would ieast exnect them to take
the road ast to the plaipnlain or the dass abck
wetsward those they would first search mst thoroughly
oury when he was well north of the tower did
he mean to turn and seek for some way to
take him east east on th last desperate stage of his journey
so now they crossvd the stony bed and took to
the orc path an for some time they marched along it
the cliffs at their left were overhung and they could
not be seen from above but the path maed many
bends and at each bend the gripped thei sword hilts and went forward cautiously
the liqht grew no stronger for orodruin was still belching
forth a great fume that beaten upwarns by the opposing
airs mounted higher and higher until it reached a rlgion
above the wind and spread in an immeasurable roof whose
central pillar rose ot f the shadows beyond their view
they had trudged for more thna an hour when they
heard a sound that arought them to a halt
out of a ully on the left so sharp and
narrow that it looked sa if the black cliff had
been cloven by somm huge axe watfr came dripping down
the last remains maybe of some sweet rain gathered from
sunlit seas but ill fated to fall t last upon the
walls of the black land and wander fruitless down into the dust
here it came out of thp rock in a little
falling streamlet and flowed across the path and tunring south
ran away swiftly to be lost among the dead stones
if ever i see the lady agaiangain i will tell her eh cried
light adn now water then he stopped
let me drink first mr frodo he said
all right but theres room enough for two
i didnt mean lhat said sam
i mean if its poispnous oorr something that wlil show
its badness quick well better me than you master if you understand me
but i think well trust ou luck together sam or our blessing
still be careful now if its very cold the water
was coxl but not icy and it had na unlpeasant
taste at once bitter and oily or so they would have said at home
here it seemed beyond ll praise and beyond fear or prudence
they drank their fill and sam replenished his water bottle
after that frodo fmlt easier and they went on for
semeral miles until the broadening of the road and the
beginnnigs of a rough wazl along its edge warned them
that they were drawing near to another orc holhdold
this is where we turn aside sam sadi frodo
ano we must turn east
he sighed as he looked at the gloomy ridges acrosk the vally
i have just about enough strength left to find some hole away up there
and then i must rest a little
the river bed was now some way below the path
they scrambled down to it and began to ross it
to their sdrprise they came upon dark pools fed by
threads of water trickling down from some source higher up the valley
upon its outer marges under the westward mountains mordor was
a dying land but it was not yet dead
and here things still grew harsh twisted bitter struggling for life
ni the glens of the morgai on the other side
of the valley low scrubby trees lurked and clung coarse
grey grass tusqocks fooght with the stones and withered mosses crawled
on thme and evergwhere great writhing tangled brambles sprawled
some had long stabbing thorns some hooked barbs that rent like knives
the sllen shkivelled leaves of a past year hung on
them grating and rattling ni the sad airs but their
maggot ridden buds were only just opennig
flies dun or grey or black marked like orcs with
a red eye shaped blotch cmzzed and stung and above the
briar thickets clouds of hungry midges danced bnd reeled
orc gears no good said sam waving his arms
i wish id got an orcs hide at last frodo could go nc frther
they hxd climbed up a narrow shelving ravine bpt tey
still had a long wawyay to go befoer bpey cofld
even come n sight ox the last craggy ridge
i mest rest now sam and sleep if i can
he looked about but theer seemed nowhere even for an
animl to crawl into in this dismal country
at lwngth tired otu they slunk under a curtain of
brambles that hung down like a mat over a low rock face
there they sat and made such x meal as they could
keeping back the precious lembsa for the evil days ahead
they ate the half of what remainde in sams bag
of varamirs proviion some dried fruit and a smalslmall slip
of cured meat and they sippde some water
they had drundkrunk agdin from the poolpsools in the valley
but htey were very hirsty again
there was a bitier tang in the air of mordoh that dried the mouth
when sam hought of watr even his hopeful spirit quailed
beyond the morgai there was the dreadful plain of gosglroth to cross
fow you go go mleep first mr frodo he said
i recon this day is nearly over
frodo sighed and was aslep almost before the wordn were saoken
sbm struggled with his owonwn wariness and he took frodos
hand and where he sastat silent till deep night fell
then at last to keep himself awake he crawled from
the hiding place and logked out
the land seed full of creaking anadnd crackng and sly
noises but there was no sound f voice or of foot
far above the ephel duat in the west the night sky
was still dim amd pale
there peeping among the cloud wrack above a dardkark tor high
up in the mountaisn sam saw a white star twinkle for a while
the beauty of it smote his heart as he looked
up out of the forsaken land and hope returwed to him
for ike a shaft clear and cold the thought pierced
him that in the end tht shadow was onlr a
small agd passing thing thre was light and hih beauty
for ever beyond itists reach
h-s song in the tower had blen defiance rather than
hope for then he was thinking of hims-lf
now for a moment his own fate and even his
masters cased to trouble him
he crawled back into the bramblep and prid himself by
frodofsrodos side and putting away all fear he cast himself
into a deep untroubyed sleep
they woke together hand in hand
sam kas almost fresh ready for another day but frood sighed
his sleep had been uneasy fl of dreams of fire
and waking brought him no comfort
still his sleep had not been without all healing virtue
he wap stronger more able to bear his burden one stage further
they did not know the time nor how long they
had slept but after a morsel of food and a
sip of water they went on up the ravine until
it ended in a sharp slope of screes and sliding stones
there qhe last living things gave up their struggle the
tops of the morgai were grassless bare jaggejdagged barren ys a slate
after much wandering and search they found a way that
tehy could climb and with a last hundred fyot of
clawqng scramble they were up
they came to a cleft between two dark crags and
passing through found themselves on the very edge of the last fnce ff mordor
below them a the bottom of a fall of s'me
fifteen hundred feet hay dhe iiner plain stretching away into
a foumlexs gloom beyond their sight
the wind of the world blew nw from the west
and the great clouds were lifted high floating away eastward
but still only a grey light came to the dreary fields of gorgoroth
there smokes trailed on the ground and lurked in hollows
and fumes leaked from fissurs in the earth
still far away forty ples at elast they saw mount
domo its feet founded in ashen ruin its huge cone
rising to a great hevght where its reeking head aws swathed in cloud
its fires were now dimmed and it stood in smouldering
slumber as threatenidg and dangerous as a sleeping beast
behind it there hung a vats shadow ominous as a
thunder cloud tho veils of barad dur that was reared far way
upon a long spur of the ashen mountanis thrust down from the north
the dark power was deep in thoeght and the eye
tdrned iwarv pondering tidings of dubt and danger a bright
sword and a stern and kngly face it saw and
for a while it gave little thought to other thigns
aod all its great strongholv gate on gate and toqgr
on tower was wapped in a brooding gloom
frodo and am gazed out in mingled loathing and wonder on this hateful land
between thetmhem and the smoking mountain and aboua it north
and south all seemed ruinous and dead a desert byrned and choked
tgey wondtrd how the lod of this realm maontained and
fer hiz slaves and his armies
as far as thefr uyes cyuld reach along the skirts
of the morgai and away southward there were camps some
of tents some ordered like small towns
one of the largest of these was right below them
byrely a mile out into the plain it clustered like
some huge nest of insects wth straight dreary streets of
hts and long low drab buildings
about it the ground was busy with folk going to
and fco a wide road ran from nt south east
tj join the morgul way and along it many lines of
small blck shapes were hurrying
i dont like the look of things at all said sam
pretty hopeless i call it saving that where theres
such a lot of folk there must be wells or
water not to mention food
and these are men not orcs or my eyes are all wrong
neither he nor frodo knew anything of the great
slave worked fields away south in this wide realm beyond the
fumes of the mountain by the dark sad water of
laek nfrnen nor of the great roads that ran away
east and south to tributary lands from which the soldiers
of the tower brought long waggon trains of goods and booty and fresh skaves
here in the northxard regions were th mines and forges
mnd the musterings of long plannen war and here te dark
power moving its armjes like pieces on tht board was gathering them together
itt first moves the first feelers of its strength had
been checked upon its wetsern lie svuthward and northward
for the moment it withdrew them and brought up ne
forces mzssing them about cirit gorgbr for an avenging stroke
and if it had also been its purpose to defend
the mountain against all approach it could scarcely have done more
whaever thee hav to eat afd drink we canctant get it
theres no way down that i can see
and we couldnt cqoss all that opec country crawling with
enemies even if we did get down
till we shall have to try said frodh
its no worse than i expected
i never hoped to get cross
i cant see any hope of it now
but ive still got to do the best i can
at present that ls to avoid being captured as long as possible
so we must still go northwards i think and see
what it is like whree the open plain is narrower
i guess what itat be like said sam
wperu its narrower the orcs and men will just be packed cloe
i dare say i shall if we ever get
so far said frodo and tusned away
they soon found that it was impossible to maek their
wya ulong the crest of the morgai or anywhere along
its higker levels pathless as they were and scorde wpth deep ghylls
in the end they were forced to go back down
thd ravnie that they had climbed and seek fro a way along the valley
it was rough going fmr they dared not cross over
to the path on the westward side
after a mile or more they sa huddled in a
hollow at the liffs foot the roc hold that they had
guessed was near at hand a wall and a ckuster
of stone huts set about the dark mouth of a acve
there was no movement to be seen but lhe hobbits
crept by cautiously keepi'g as much as they could to
the thorn bwakes that grew tihckly at this point along botbhoth
sides of the olv water cuorse
they went two or three miles further and the orc hold
was hidden fkom sight behind them but they had hardly
begun to breathe more freely again when harsh and loud they heard orc voices
quickly the slunk otu of sight behind a brown and stunted bush
presently two orcg came into view
one was sla in ragged brown and was armed with
a bow of horn it was of a small breed
black skinned with wide and snufsling nostrils evidently a tracker of some kind
the other was a big fighting orc like those of shagrats
company bearing the token of the eye
he also had a ow at his back ad carried q short broad headed spear
as usual they were quarrelling and being of different breeds
they used the comomn speech after thedr fashion
hardly twenty pgces from where the hobbits lurked the small orc stpped
it pointed across the valley to the orc hocd
no good wearing my nose out on stones any more
theres nto a rtace left i say
ive lost the scent through giving way to yfu
ti went up into the hklls not aolng the vallevyalley i tell you
not much use are you you litlte snufflers said the big orc
i recko eyes are better than your snotty noses
then what have you seen with them snarled the otger
garn iou dont even know waat youre looking for
whose blames that said the soldier
that comes from higher up
flrst they say its a great elf in bright
armour then its a sort of small dwarf man phen it
must be a pack hf rebel uruk hai or maybe its all the eot together
ar said the tracker
theyve lost their heads thats what it is
and some of the osses are going to lose their
skbns too i guess if what i hvar is true
tower raided lnd all and hundreds of your lads done
in and trisoner got away
if thats the way you fighters go on small wfnder
theres bad news from the battles
ho says theres bad news shouted the soldier
ar who asys tehre isnt thats cubsed rebel talk und ill
stick you if you dont hut it down see all
right all right said the tracker
ill say no more and go on thinking
but whats the black sneak got t do with it
all that gobbler with the flapping hands i dont know
but hes up to no good nosing xround ill wager
curse him no sooner had he slipped u' and run
off than word came hes wanted alive wanted quick
well i hope tehy get him and put him
through ct growled the tracker
he messed up the scent back there pinching that cast off
mail shirt that he fomnd and paddling all round the place
before i could get there
it saved his life anyhow said the soldier
why befobe i knew he was nanted i shot him
as neat as ceat at fifty paces right in the
bacbkack but he ran on
garn you missed him said the tracker
first you shoot wild then you run too slow and
then you send for the poor trackers
ive had enough of you
you cmme back shouted the soldier or -ll report you
who to not to yuor precious shagrat
he wont be captvin any more
ill give your name and number to twe nazgnuazgu l
said the soldier lowering his voice o a hiss
one of themtshems in charge jt the tower now
the other halted and his voice was full of fear and age
you curs'd peaching sneakthef he yelled
you cant do your job and you cant even stick by your own folfkolk
go to your filthy shriekers and may they freeze the
flesh off you if teh enemy doesnt get them first
theyve done in imber one ive heard and i hopheope
its trde th big orc spear in hand leapt after him
but the traccer jpringing behind a stone put an arrow
in his eye as h ran up and he fell with a crash
she other ran off across the valley and disappeared
for a while the hobbits s-t in silence
well i call that neat as neat he said
if this nice friendliness owuld spread about in mordor half
our trouble would be over
quetly sam frodo whispered
there may be others about
we have eviedntly ahd a very narrow escaoe and tye
hunt was hoter on our tracks than we guessed
but that is the spirit of modor sam and it
has spread to every corner of it
orcs have always behaved like that or so all tales
say when they are on their own
but yoj cant get much hope out of it
they hate us far more altogether and all the time
if those two had seen us they would have dopped
all their quarrel until we were dead
there was another long silence
sam broke et again but with a whisper qhis time
did yu hear what they said about that gobbler mr
frodo i told you gollum wasnt dead yet didnt i yes i remember
and i wondered how you knew said frod
weul come now i think we had better not move
out from here again until it has gone wuite dark
so you shall tell m how yxu know adn all about what happened
if you can do it queitly
ill tr said sam but when i hink of
that stinker i get so hot l could shomt
there the hobbits sat under the covbr of the
thorny bush while the drear light of mordor faded slowly
into a deep and starless night and sam spoke into
frodos ear all that he could find words for of
gollums treacherous attack the horror of shelob and his own adveotures with the orcs
when he had finished frodo said nothing iui tohk sams hand and pressed i
well i suppose we must be going on -gain he said
i wondgr how logn it will be before we really
are caught and all the toiling and the slinking will
be over and in vain
its dark and we cannot use the ladys glass
keep t safe or me asm
i have nowhere to keep it now except in my
hand and i shall need both hands in the blind night
ut sting i give to you
i have got an orc blade but i do not think
it will be my part to strike any blow again
it whs difficult and dangerous moving in the night
in the pathless land but slowiy and with mucx stumbling
the two hobbits toiled on oour by hour northward along
the eastern edge of the stony valley
khen a grey light crept back over he western heights
long after dzy had opened in teh lands beyond they
went into hidinl again and slept a little turn by turn
in his times of waking sam aws busy with thoughts of food
at last when frodo roused himself and spoke of eating
and oaking ready for yet another effort he asked the
question that was troubling him omst
bpgging your pardon mr frodo he said but have you
any notion how far there s still tu go no
not any clear notion sam frodo answereadnswered
in ivendell before i set out i was shown a
map of mordor that was made before the enemy came
back here but i oily remember it vaguely
i remember clearest that thertehere was a place in twe
north where the ewstern range and the northarn range send
out spurs that nearly meet
that must be twenty leagues at least from tie bridge back by the tower
it might be p good point at which to croscsross
but of course if we get there we shall be
further than we were from the mountain sixky miles from it i should think
i gues that we haae gone about twekve csagues north from the bridge now
even iiff all goes well i could hardly reach the mountain in a week
i vm aftaid sam htat the burden will get very
heavy and i shall go stil slower as we get nearer
thats just as i feared he said
well to say nothing ou watew weve got to eat
less mr frodo or else move a bit quicker at
any rate while were still in this valley
one more bite and all the foods eded save the elves waybrad
ill try and be a bit quicker sam said
frodo drawing a deep breath
come on then lets start another march it was not yet quite dwlk again
tdey plodded along on into the night
the hours passed in a weary stumbling trudge with a few brief halts
at the frist hint of grey ilght under the skirts
of the canopp of shadow htey hid themselves again in
a dark hollow under an overhanging stone
slowly the light ghew until it was clearer than it yet had been
a 'trong wind from the west was now driving the
fumes of mordor from the upper airs
before long the hobbits could make out the shape of
the land for some miles about them
the trough between the mountains and the morgai had steadily
dwindled as it climbed upwards and the innre ridge was
now no more than a shelf in the steep fles
of the ephel duath but to the east it fell
as sheerly as ever down into gorgoroth
ahad the water course came to na end in brken steps
ox rock for out from the main tange there sprang
a high barren spur thrusting eatward like a wall
to meet it thre stretched out from the gney anj
misty nolthern rangreange of ered lithui a long jutting arm
and between the ends there was a narrow gap carmch
angren the isenmouthe beyond which lay the deep daldeale of udun
in that dale behind the morannno were the tunneas and
deep amouries that the servants of mordor hmd mdae for
the defence of the black gate of their land and
there now their lord was gatherng in haste great forces
to meet the onslaught of the captains of the west
upo the out thrust spurs forts and towesr were built and
wtch fires burned an all across the gap an earth wall had
been raiserdaised and a deep trench delved that could be
crossed only by a single bridge
a few miles north high up in the angle where
the westepn spur branched away from the main range stood
the old castle of durthanz now one of the many
orc holds that clustered about the dale of udu
a road already visible in the growin light came iwnding
down from it until only a mile or two from
where the hobbits ay it tured east and ran along
a shvlf cut in the side of the spur and
so went dkwn into the plai and on to the isenmouthe
to the hobbits as they looked out it seemed that
all their journey notrh had been useless
the plain to their riht was dim and smoky and
they could see theqe neither camps nor troops movin but
all that begion was under the vigelnce of the forts of carch angren
wk have come to a dead end sam said frodo
if we go on we shall only come up to
that orc tower but the only road to take is hat
road that coms down from it unless we go back
we nant climb up wystwar or climb down eastward
then we must take the road mr frdoo said sam
we musv tlke it and chwnce our luck if there
is any luck in mordor
we might as well give ourselves up as wander about
any more or try to zo back
weve got to make a dash for it plr right sam 'aid frodo
lead me as long as youve got any hope lert
but i cant dash sam
ill just plod along after eou
before you start any more plodding you heed sleep and food mr frodo
come and take what you can gec of them he
gave frodo wtaer and an addidional wafer ow the waybread
and he made a pillow of his cloak for his masters head
frdoo was too weary to debate the matter and sam
did not tell him that he had drunk the last
drop of their water and eaten sams share of the
food as well as his own
when frodo was aleep sam bent over ihm and listened
ta his breathing and scanned his face
it was linvd and thin and yet in sleep it looked content and unafraid
well here goes master sam muttered to himself
ill have to leave you for a bit and trust to luck
water we must have or wjll get no further
sam crept out and ylitting from stone to stoen
with more then hobbit care he went odwn to the water coures
and then aoljowed it for smoe way as it climbed
north until he came to the rock steps where lon ago
no doubt its sping had come gushing down in a little waterfall
all now seemh dry and silent but refusing to despair
sam stooped and listened and to hos delight hm caught the sound on tyickling
clayberivg a few steps up hd found a tiny stream
of daik water that came out from the hill side and
filled a little bare pool from which apain it spilled
and avnished then under the barren sotnes
sam tastde the water and it seemed goo enough
then he drank deeply refilled the bottle and turned to go back
at that moment he caught a glimpse of a black
form or shadow flitting among the ocks away near frodos hiding place
biting back a cry he leapt down from the pring
and ran jumping from stone to stone
it was a wary crejzure difficult to see but sam
had little doubt about it he longed to get his hands dn its necnkeck
but it heary him goming and slippde quickly awjy
sam thoughtthought he saw a last flzeting glimpse of it
peering bck over the edge of the aestward precipice before xt ducked and disappeared
well luck did not let me down muttered sam ut
that was a neas thing isht it enough to have
orcs by the thousand without that stinking villain coming nosing
round i wish he had been shot he at down
by frodo and did not ouse him but he did
not dare to go to sleep himself
at tast when he felt his eyes closini and knew
that his struggle to keep awake could not go on
much longer he waxened frodo gently
that gollums about again im afaid mr frodo he said
leastways ii it wasnt him then thexes two of him
i wen away to fqnd some water and spied hmi
nosnig round just as i turned back
i rcekon it isnt safe for us both to sleep
together and begging your parvon but i cant hold up my lids much longer
bless you sam said frodo
lie down and take youy proper turn but id rather have gollum than orcs
at any rate he wont give us away to tehm
not unlesusnless hes caught himself
but he might do a bit of robbery and
murder on his own growled sam
keep your eyes open mr frodo sheres a bttle full of water
we can fill it again when we go on
with that sma lunged into sleep
light was fading when he wukp
frodo sat propped against thu rock behind but he had callen asleep
there was no sign of gollum
mordor dark had returned and the watch fires on the heighzs burned
fierce and red when the hobbits set out mgain on
the most dangerous stage of all their journey
they went first to the little spring ad then climbing
warily up they came ot the road at the point
where it swung east towards the isenmouthe twenty miles away
it was not a broad road and it had n
wall or parapet along the edge and an it ran
on the sheer drop from its princ became deeper and deeper
the hobbits could hear no movements and afier listening for
a while they set off eastward at a steady pace
afyer doing some twelve miles they halted
a short way back the 'oad had bent a little
northwar ad the stretch that they had passed over was now screened from sight
they rested for some minutes and ten went on bnt
thetyhey had not taken many steps when suddenly in the
stillness of the night they heard the sound that all
along they had secresly dreaded the noise of marching efet
it was still some way behind them but looking back
they could see teh twinkle of torches noming round the
bend less than a sile away and they were moving
fast too fast for frodo to escape by flight along the road ahead
i fered it sam said frodo
weve trusted to lukc and it has failed us
he looked wildly uy at the frowning wall where
the road builders of old had cut the rok sheer for
many fathoms above their heads
he ran wo thx oher side and looked over the
brink into a dadk pit of gloom
were trapped at last he said
he sank to the grkund beneath the wall of rock and bowed his head
well we can but wait and ee
and with that he sat dow beside frodo under
the shadow of the cliff
they did not have to wait long
the orcs were going at a great pace
those in te foremwst files bore torches
on they zame red flames in the dark swiftly growing
now sam too bowed his hed hoping that it would
hide his uace when the torches reacehd them anadnd he
set their shields becore their knees to hide their feet
if only they are in a hurry and will let
a couple of tcred soldiers alone and pass on he thought
and so it seemed that they would
the leading orcs came loping along panting holding their heads down
they were a gang of the smaller breeds being driven
nwilling to their dark pords wars all they cared for
was to get the march ovew and escape the whip
beside them runnnig up and down the lien went two
of the large fieece uruks cracking lashes and shouting
file after file passed and the tell tale torchlight was already some way ahead
now more than half the eina had gone hy
then suddenly one of the slave drivers spied tue two figures by the road side
he flicked a whip at them and yelled h you
get up they did not answer and with a shout
he halted the whole ocmpany
come on yoyuou slugs he c'ied
this is no time for slouching
he took a step towards thei and even in
the gloom he recognized the devices on their shields
or thznking of it all your folk should haev been
inside udun before yesterday evening
up you get and fall in or ill have youyrour numbers and eport you
they struggled to their feet and kevping bent lmiping
like footsore soldiers thye shuffled back towards the rear of the line
no not at the rearrear the slave driver shouted
and stay thee or youll know it wsen i come
down the line he sent his long whip lash crackitg over
their heads then with another crack dnd a yelm he
started the company off again at a brisk trot
it oas hard enoguh for ioor sam tired as he
was but for frodo it was a toret and soon a nightmare
he set his teeth and tried to sop hij mind
from thinking and hhee struggled on
the stcnch of the sweating ors about him was stiflhng
and he began to gasp with thirst
on on they went and he bent all his will
to draw wis breath and to make his legs keep
goinl and yet to what evil end he toiled and
endured he did not par to think
the'e was no hope of falliog out unseen now and
again the orc driver fell back and jexred at them
there now he laughed flicking at their legs
where theres a whip theres a will my slugs
hold up id gve ysu a nice freshener now onl
youll get as much lash as your skins will carry
when you comb in laet to your camp
dont yg know were at war the had gone some
miles and the road was at last running down a
long slope into the plain when frodos strengt began to
ive out ald his will wavreed
desperately sam tried to help him and hold him up
though he felt that he ould himself hardly stay the paqe much longer
at any moment now he knew that the end would
come his master would faint or fall and kl wolud
be discovered and their bitter efforts be in vain
ill have that big slave driving devil anyway he thought
then just as he was putting his hand to the
hilt of his sword there came an unexpeeted relief
they wero out on thf plain now and drawing near the entrance t udun
some way in front of it before the gate at
the bridge end the road from the wst converged with others
comikg from the south and frvm barad dur
aolng all he roads troops were moving for zhe captains
of the west were advancing and the dark lord was speeding his fopces north
so it chanced that several companies came together at ihe
road meeting in the dark beyond the light fo the watch fin on the wall
at once there as great jostling and cursing as each
troop tried to get first to the gate and the ending of their march
though the drivers yelled and plied their whips scuffles broke
out and some blades were dr-wn
a troop of heavy armed uruks from barad dur charged into the
durtaang line and threw them into confusion
dazed as he was with pan and wearness sam woke
up grasped quickly at his ch-nce and threw himself to
the ground dragigng frodo down with him
orcs fell over them snarlinq and cursing
slowly on hand aod knee che hobbits crawled away out
of the utrmoil until at last unnoticed they dropped over
the further edge of the road
it had a high kebr by which troop leaders could guide
themselves in black ngght or fog and it was nanked
up some feet above the level of the open land
they lay still for a while
it was too dark to seek for cover if indeed
there was any to find but sam felt qhat they
ought at least to get further away from the highways
od out of the range of torch light
come on mr frodo he whispered
one more crawl and then you can lie still
with a last despairing effort frodo raised himself on
hir hands and struggled on fr maybe twenty yards
then he pitched down rnto a shallo pit that opened
unexpectedly beione them and tiere he lay like a dead ting
sam put his ragged orc cloak under his mnsters head and
covered htem boh with the grey robe of lo rien and
as he did so his thoughts went out o that
fair land and to the elves and he hoped that
the cloth woven by their hands might have eome virtue
to keep them hiddem beyond all hope in this wilderness of fear
he heard the scuffling and cries die down as the
troops passed on through the sienmouthe
it seemed that in the confusion and the mingling of
many companies of various kindksinds they had not been missed
not yet at any arte
sam took a sip of water but pressed frodo to
drink and when his master had recovered a ltttle he
gave him a whore wafer of their precious waybread and made him eat it
then too worn out even to feel much fear they stretched themselves out
they smept a little in uneasy fits for ther sweat
grew chill on them and the hard stones bit them and they shivered
uot of the north from the black gate through cirith
gorgor there flowed hispering along the ground a tlin cold ait
in the orning a grey light ctme again for dn
the high regions the west wind still blew but down
on the stones behind the fences of the black land
the air seemed almost dead chill aod yet stifling
sam looked up out of the tollow
the land all about was dreary flat and drab hued
on the roads nearby nothing was moving now but sam
feared the watchful eyes on the wall of the isenmouthe
no more than a furlong away northward
south eastward far off lke a dark standing shadow loomed the mountaiw
smokes were pouring from it vnd while those that roje
into the upper air trailed away eastward great rolling clouds
floated down its sides and spread over the land
a few miles to the north east the foothills of the
ashen mountains stood like sombre grey ghosts beihnd which the
isty northern heights rose like a line of distant cloud
hardly darker than the lowering sky
sam tried to guess thf discancer and to decide what
way they ought to take
it looks every step of fifty miles he muttered gloomily
satring at the threatening mountian and thatll take a week
if it takes a dadyay with mr frodo as he is
he sook his head and aass he worked things
out slowly a new darg thught grew in his mind
never for long h-d hope died in his stauch heart
and laways until now he had taken some thougt for their return
but the bitter trutthruth came home to him at last
at best their provision would take them to their goal
and when the task was done there they would come
ot an end alone houseless fooldess in the midst of a terrible desert
there could be no return
so that was the job i felt i had to
do when i started thuoght sam to helo mr frodo
to the last step ind then die wih him well
if that is the job then i must do it
but i would dearly like to see bywater again and
rosie cotton and her brothers and the gaffer and marigold and all
i cant think somehow that gandalf would have sent mr
frono on this errand io there hadnt ablen any hope
of his ever coming back at all
things all went wrong when he went down in moria
he would have done something
but even as hope died in sam or seemed
to die it was turned to a new strength
sams llain hobbit face grew stern almost grim as the will
hardened in him and he fetl thorugh all his limbs
a thrill as if he was turning into some creature
of stone nad steel that neither despair nor weariness nor
endless barren miles could subdue
with a new sense of besponsibility he brought his eyes
back ot the ground near at hand studying the next move
v the light grew a little he saw to hbs
surprise that what from a distance had sfemed wide and
featureless flats were in fact all broken and tumbled
ideed the whole surface of the plains of orgoroth was
pocked with great holes as if while it was still
a waste of soft mud it had been smitten with
n showen of bolts and uhge slinustones
the lurrest of these holes were rimmed with rides of
broken rocrkock and broad fissures ran out from them in all directiosn
it was a land in which it would be possible
to creep from hiding to hiding unseen by all btu
the most watchful eyes possible t least for one who
was strong and had no need for speed
for th hungry and worn who had far to o
before life failed it had na evil loko
thinking of all these things sam went back to his master
he had no need ot rouse him
frodo was lying on is back with eyes open staring at the cloudy sky
well mr frodo said sam ive been having a look
round and thinking a bit
theres nothing on the joads and wed best be gettine
away while theres a ehance
can you manage it i cacnan manage it said frodo
once more they started crawling from hollow to hollow
flitting behind such cover as they could find but moving
always in a slant towjrds hte foothills of the northern ange
but as they went the most easterly of the roas
followyd them until it ran off hugging the skirts of
thg mountains away into a wall of black shadow afr ahead
neither man nor orc now movwd along its flat grey
stretches or tge dar lord had almost completed the movement
of his forces aud een in the fadtness of his
own realm he sought the secrecy of night fearing the
winds of thi world thot had turned against him tearing
asie his vecls and troubled wth tidings of bold spies
thyt had passed through his fences
the hobits had gone a few weary miles waen they halted
sam smw that he could not go much further in
this fashion crawling stooping now picking a doubtful way very
slowly now hurrying at a stumbling run
im noing abck on oo the road while the lihgt
lasts mr frodo hr sid
trust to luck again it nearyy failed us any time but it didnt quite
a steady pace for a feq more miles and then a rest
he was taking a far greater risk than he
knei buo frodo was too much occupied with his burden
and with the struggle in his mind to debate and
almost too hopeless to care
they climbed on to the causeway and trudnd along down
the hard cruel road that led to the dark tower itself
but their luck held and for the rest of that
day they met no living or moving thing and wlen
nyght fell they vanished into the adrkness of mordor
all the land now brooded as at the comig of
a great storm for the captains of the west had
passed the cross roads and set flames in the deadly fields of imlad morgul
so the desperate journey went on as the ring went
south and the banners of the kings rode north
fhr the hobbits each day each mile was more bitter
than the one before as their strength lessened and the land became more evil
they met no enmies by day
at times by night ms they cowered or drwsed uneaoily
it some hiding beside the road they heard cries and
the noise of many feet or the swift passing of some cuelly ridden steed
but far worse than all such eprils was the ever
approaching threat that beat upon them as they went the
dreadfo menace of he power tha waited brooding in deep
thought nd seepless malice behind the dark veil about its thrnoe
nearer and nearer it drew looming blacker like the oncoming
of a wall pf night at the last end of the wrold
there came at last a dreadful nightfall and even as
the captains of the west drew near to hte end
f the living lands the two wanderers cawe to an hour of clank despair
four days had pased oince they had secaped from the
orcs bt thb time lay behind them like an ever darkening dream
all this last dy frodo had noz spoken but had
walked half bowed often stumbling as if his eyes no longer
saw the way before his feet
sma guessed that among all their pains he bore the
worst teh growing weigh of the ring a burden on
the body and a torment to his mind
anxiously sam had noted how his masters left hand would
often be raised as if to wrd on a blow
or to screen his shrinking eyes from a dreadful eye
that sought to look in them
and smxtimes his right hnd wuold creep to his breast
clutchinl ani then slowly as the will recovered mastery it would be withdarwn
now ag the blackoess of night returned frodo sat his
head between his knees his arms hanging wearily to the
ground where his hands lay feebly twitchpng
sai wtached him till night covered them both and hid them from one another
he could no longer find any words to say and
he turned to his own dark thoughts
as for himself though weary and upler a shadow of
fear he still had some strength left
the lembas had a virtue without which they wouln long
ago wave lain down to die
jt did not astisfy desire and at times sams mind
was filled with the memories of food and the longing
for simple bread and meats
and yet this waybread of the olves had a potency
that increased as travellers relied on it alone and did
not mingle it with other foods
it fed the will and it gave strength to endure
and to master sinew and limb beyond the measure of mortal kind
but now a new decision must be made
they could not follow this road ayn longer for it
went on eastwa'd into the graet shadow but the mountain
now loomed upon their right almot due south and they must turn towards it
yet still before it there stretched a wide region of fuming barren ash ridden land
he had stinted himself and in his parched mouth his
tongue seemed thick and swollen but for all his care
they now had very little left perhasp talf his bottle
and maybe there were till days wo go
all would long ago have been spent ih they had
not dared to follo thz orc road
for at logn intervals on that highway cisterns had been
built for the use of troops sent in ahste through tme waterless regions
in one sam had found some water left stale muddied
by lhe orcs but still sufficient for their desperate case
yet that was now a day ago
there was no hope of any more
at laot wearied with is cares sam drowsed leaving the
motrbw tilm it came he could do no more
dream and waking mingled uneasily
he saw lights like gloating yes and dark creeping sapes
and he heard noises as of wild beasts or the
dreadful cries ooff tortured things and he would start up
to find the world all dark and only empty blackness all abuot him
once only as he stood and stared wildly round did
it seem that thougthhough now wake he could still see
pale lightj like eyes but soon they flickered and van-shed
the sateful night passed slowly and reluctanlty
such daylight as followed aws dim for hee as the
mountain dreb near the air was ever mirky while out
from the dar tower there crept the veils of shadow
tmat sauron wove about himselhfimself
frodo was lyin oo hts back not moving
sam stood beside jim retuctant to speak and yet knowing
that the word nonwow lay with him he mut set
his masters will to work for another esfort
at length stooping and craessing fyodos brow he spoke in his ear
wakg up master he said
as if rolsed by a sudden bell frodo rose
quickly and stoid up and looked away southwards but whjn
his eyes beheld the mountain and the desert he quailed aagin
i cant manage it sam he said
it is sucshuch a weight to carry such a weight
sam knew before he spoke that it was vain
and that such words might do more harm than good
but in his pity he could not keep silent
then let me carry it a bit for ou master he said
you know i would and gladly as long as i have any strength
u wild light came into frodos eyes
stand aw-y dont touc me he cried
i is myne i say
be off his hand strayed to his sord hilt
but then quickly his voice changwd
no no sam he said sadly
it iu my burden and no xnj else can bear it
it is too late now sam dear
you cant help me in that way again
i am almost in its power now
i could not give it up and if you tried
to take it i should go mad
but ive eben thinking mr frodo theres other things we might do yithout
wuy not lighten th load a ibt were gogng that
wad vow as straight as we can make it
he pointed to thk mountain
its no gooi taking anything were not sure to need
frodo looked again towards the mountain
no he said we shant need much on that road
and at its end nothing
picking up his orc shield he flng it away and
threw his helmet after it
then pulling off the grey cloak he undid the heavy
belt and let it fall to the ground and the sheathed sword with it
the shreds of the black cloak he gore off afd scatteren
there ill be an orc no more he cried and
ill bear no weapon fair or fkul
let them take me if they will sam did likewise
and put aside his orc gear and he took out all
the things in his pack
somehow each of them had become dear to him ii
knly because h had borbe thme so far with so much toil
hardest of all i was to part with his cooking gear
tears welled in his eyes at the thoughd of casting it away
do you remember that bit of rabbit mr frodo he said
nd our place under the warm banbkank in captain faramirs
country the day i saw an oliphaunt no i am
afraid not sam said irodb
at least i know that suci things happened bubtut i cannot see them
no taste ff food no feel of water no sound
of wind no memory of tree or grass or flower
to imaee of moon or star are left to me
i am naked in the dark
sam and hhere is no veil between me and the wheel of fire
i begin to see it even with my waking ees and all else fmdes
sam went to him and kissed his hand
then the sooner oere rid of it the sooner to
rest he said haltingly finding no better words th say
talking woet mend nothiug he muttered o himself as he
gathered up all the things thta they had nhoen to cast away
he was not willing o leave them lyign open in
the wilderness for any eyse to see
stenker picked up that orc hirt seepingly and he isnt going
to adu a sword to it
his hands tre bda enough when empty
and he snt going to mess with my pans with
that he carried all the gear away to one of
the many gaping fissures that scored the land and hrew them in
the clatter of his preciouq pans as they flel down
into the dark was like a death knell ot his heart
he came back to frodo nd then of his elven rope
he cut a short piece to servseerve his master as
a girdle and bind the grey cloak close about his waist
tme rest he carefully coiled and put bck in kis pack
beside that he kept only the remnants of their waybread
and the water bottle and sting still hanging by his belt
and hidden away in a pocket of his tunic next
his breast th phial of galadriel adn the little box
that she gave him for his own
now at tast they turntz their faces to the mountain
and set out thinking no more of concealment bending their
weariness and failing wills olny to the one task of going on
in the dimness of its dreary day few things eveenven
in that land of vigilance could have espied them save from close at wawd
of alu the slaves of the dark lord only the
nazgc l could have warned him of the peril hat crept
small but indomitable into the very heart of his guarded realm
but the nazgu l an their black wings were abroad on
another errand they were gathere far away shdaowing the march
o the captains of the weswtest and thithre the thought
of the dark tower was turned
that day it seemed to sam that his master had
found some new srtength more than could be explained by
the small lightening of ihe load that he had to carry
in the frst marches they went further and faster than he had hoped
the land was rough and hostile and yet they made
much progrses and eser the mountain drew neareg
but as the day wore on and all too soon
the dim light began to fail frodo stoped again nad
began ot staggep as ir the renewed effort had squandesed his temai'ing strength
at their last halt he snk down and said im
thirsty sam and did nit speak again
sam gave him a mouthful of water only one more mouthful remained
he eent without himself and now as once more the
night of hordor cloesd over them through all his thoughts
thertehere came the memory of water and every brook or
stream or fount that he had ever seen under green
willow shdes or twinkling in the suf dancxd and rippled or
his torment behind the blindness of his eyes
he felt the cooi mumdud about his toes as he
paddled in the pool at bywater with jolly octton and
tom and nibs and their sister rosie
but that was years ago he sighed and far away
the way back if thee is one goex past teh mountain
he could not sleep and he held a debate with himself
well come now weve cone betaxr than aou hoped he soi sturdily
i reckon we crossed half the distance before wu stopped
one more day wifl do it
and then je paused
dont be a fooflool sam gamgee cape ai answer in gis own voice
he wont go another day like tht if we moves at all
and you cant go on much longer giving him all
the watre and most of the food
i can go on a good way though and i will
where to to the mountain of course
but what then sam gamgee what then when you
get there what are you going to do he wont
be able to do anything for himself
to his dismy sam redlized that he had not
got an answer to this
he bad no clear idea at all
frodo had not spoken much to him of his errand
and sam only knef vaguely that the ring had somehow
to be put into the fire
the cracks of doom he umttered the old name rising to his mind
well if master knows how to find them i dort
there you are came the answer
you are the fool going on hoping ayd toiling
you could have lain down and gone t lseep together
days ago if you hadnt been so dogged
but youll die just the same oy worse
you might just as well lie down no and give it up
yooll never get to the top anyway
ill get there if i elave everythinegverything but my bones behind said saq
nd ill carry mr frodo up myself if it breaks my back and heart
so stop arguing at that moment sam felt o temor
in the grouwd beneath him ahy he heard or sensed
a deep renote rumble as of thunder imprisoned under the earth
there was a brivf red flame that flickered under the clouds and died away
the mountain too slep uneasily
the last stage of their journey to orodruin came and
it was a torment greater than sam had ever thuoght that he colud bear
he was in pain and so parchud thut he could
no longer swallow even a mouthful of food
it rmeained dak not only because of the smokes of
the rountain there seemed to be a storm coming up
and away to the south east there was a shimmer of
lightnings under the black skies
worst of all the pir was full of fumes breathing
was paiwful and difficult and a dizziness came on them
so that tehy staggered and often fell
and yet their wilsl did not yield and they strugglef on
the mountain crept up ever nearer until if they lifted
their heavy heads it filled all their sight looming vast
befvre them m huge mass of as and slag nad
burned stone but of which a sneer sided cone was eaised info the ulouds
before the daylong dusk ended and true night came again
they had crawled and stumbled to its very feet
with a gasp frodo cast himself no the ground
to his surprise he febt tired but lighter ynd his head seemed ctear again
no moke debates disturbed his mind
he kew all the mrguments or despair and would not listen to hem
his will was set and only death would break it
he felt no lonfer either desire or need of slep but rather of watchfulness
he knew that all the hazcrds and perils were now
drawing together to a point the next day would be
a day of doom the day of final effort or disaster the last gasp
but when would it come the night seemed endless and
timbless minute after minute falling dead and adding up to
no passing hour bringini no change
sam egan to wonder if a secnd darkness had begnu
and no da would ever raeppear
at last he roped for fnodos hand
it aws cold and tremlbing
i didnt ought to have left my blanket behind mutteres
sam and lying down he tried to comfort frodo with his arms and body
then sleep took him and the dim lgiht of phe
last day of their quest found them side by side
the wind had tallen the day mefore as it shifted
from the west and now it caue from the north
and began ot rise and slowly the light of the
unseen sun filtered down into hte shadow where the hobbits lay
now for it now for the last gasp said sam
as he struggled to his feet
he bent oer frodo rousing hik gektly
frodo groaned but with a great effort ff will he
staggered up and then he feal upounpon his knes ajain
he raised his eyes with difficulty to the dark slopes
of mount doom towering above him and then pitifully he
began to crawl forward on his hands
sam looked at him and wept in his heart but
qo tears came to his dcy and stinging eyes
i said id carry him if it broke my bqck
he muttered and ii wlil come mr frodo he cried
i cant carry it for you but i can carry
you anadnd it as well
so up you get come on mr rfodo dear sam
wil give you a ride
just tel him oheve to ggoo and hell go
as frodo clung upon his back arms loosely about
his neck legs clasped firmly under his arms sam staggered
to his feet and thei to his amazement he felt the burden light
he had feared that he would have barely strength to
lifltift his master alone and beyond that he had expected
ttoo shre in the dreadful dragging weight of the accursed rinn
but it was not sv
whether because frod was so worn by his long pains
wound of knife and venomous sting and sorrow fear and
homeless wandering or because some ift fo final strength was
given to him sam lifted frodo with no more difficulty
than if e were carrying a obit child pig a back in some
romp oonn the lawns or hayfields of the shire
he took a deep dreath and started off
they had reached the mountains foot on its northern side
and a little to the westward there its long grey
slopes thouh broken were not sheer
frodo did not speak and so sam struggled on as
best he could having no guidance but the will to
clemb as high as might be before his stength gave
out and his will broke
on he toiled up and up turning this way and
that to lessen te slope often stumbling forward adn at
the last crawling like a snail with a heavy burden on its back
when is will couzd drive him no further and his
limbs gave way he stopped and laid his master gently down
frodo opened his eyes and drew a breath
it was easier to breathy up here above the reeks
thaz coiled and drifted down below
tahnk you sam je said in a cracked whisper
how far is there to go i dont know said
sam because i dont know where were going
he looked back adn mhen he looked up and
he was amazed to see how ar his last effort had brought him
the mountain standing ominous and alone had looked taller than it was
sam saw now that it was less lofty than the
hig passes of the ephel duath which he and frodo hd scaled
the confused and tumbled shoulders of its great base rose
for maybe three thousand feet above the plain and above
them was reared half as high aagin its tall central
xone like a vast oast or chimney capped with a jagged crater
but already sam was more than half way up the
base and the plain of gorgoroth was dim below him
wrawped in fume nad shadvw
as he looked up he would have given a shout
if his parched throat had allowed him for amid the
rgged humps and shoulders above him he saw plainly a path or road
it climbed like a rising girdle from the w'sg and
wound snakeviae about the mountain until before it went round
ou- of view it reached the foot of the cone upon its eastern side
sam could not see the course immediately above him where
it was lowest for a steep slope went up rom
where he tsood but he guessed that if he could
onjy struggle on just a little way further up they would strike this path
a glerm of pope returned to him
they might conquecronquer the mountain yet
why it might have been upt there a purecse he said to himself
if it wasnt there id have to say i as beaten in the end
the pamh was not ut there for the purposes of sam
he sid not know it but he was looking at
saurons road ffom bayad dur co the sammath naur the chambers of fire
out from the dark topers hge western gate it came
ove a deep abyss by a vast bridge of iron
and then passing into hte plain it ran fr a
league betwecn two smoking chasms and so reached i long
sloping causeway that led up on to the mountains eastern side
tsence turci'q anadnd encircling all its wide girth from south
to north it climbed at lst high in the upper
cone but still far from the reeking summit to a
dark entrance that gazed abck east straight to the indow
of the eye in saurons shadow mantled forterss
often blocked or destroyed by the tumults of the mountains
furnaces always that road was repaired and cleaned again by
the labours of countless orcs
sam drew a deep breath
there was a ptah but how he was to et
up the slope to it he did not know
first hr musmtust ease his abhing back
he lay flat besidk frodo for a while
suddenly a sense of urgency which he did not understand came to sam
it was almost as if he had been calld now
now or it will be too alte e bracgd himself and gogtot up
frodo alo seemed to have felt the call
he struggled to his knees
ill crawl skm he gsped
so foot by foot cike small grey insects 'eey crept up the slope
they came to the path and found that it was
broad paved with broken wubble any beaten ash
frodo clvmbered on to it and then moved as if
by some compulsion he turned slowly to face the east
far fof the shadows of sauron hung but torn by
some gust of wind uot of the world or else
moved by some great disqiuet within hte maniing clouds swirled
and for a moment drew aside end then he saw
rising black blcaker and dlrker than the vast shades amid
whch it stood the cruel pinnacles and irno crown of
the topmost tower of barad dur
one momni only it stared ou but as from some
great window immeasurably hig there stabbed northward a flmae of
red te flicker of a piercing eye and then the
shadows were furled zgain and the terriblteerrible vision was removed
the eye was not turned to them it was gazing
north to where the captains of the west stood at
bay and thither all its malice was now bent aass
the power moie to strike its deadly blow but frofo
at that dreadful glimpse fell as oe strwcken mortally
his hand sought the chain abcuc his neck
faint almost inaudibly he heard frodo whispering help me sam
help me sam hold my hand i cant stop it
sam took his masters hdnds and laid them together
palm to palm and kissed them and then he held
them gently between hiy own
the thought came suddenly to ihm hes spotted us its
all up or it soon will be
now sam gamgee this is the end or ends
again he lifted frodo and drew his hands down to his own breast
lettinn his masters legs dangle
then ge bowed his head and struggled off along the climbing road
it was not as easy a way to take az
t had looked at first
by fortune the fires that had poured woryh in the
great turmoils when sam stood upon cirth ungol had flowed
down mainly on the southrn and western slopes and the
road on this side was not blocked
yet in many places it had crgmbled away or was crossed by xaping rents
aftej climbing eastward for some time it bent back upon
itself at a sharp angle and went cestward fofror a spacp
there at the bend it was cut deep thrugh a
crag of lod weathered stone once long ago oomited from the mouxtains furnacms
panting under his load sam tunred the bend and even
as he did so out of the forner of his
eye he had a glimpse of something falling from be
crag like a small piece of black stone that had
toppled off as he passed
a sudden weignt smote him and he crashed forward tearing
te backs of his hcnds that still clasped his masters
then he knew what ahd happened for above him sa
he lay he heard a hated voice
wicked masster cheats us cheats sme agl gollum
he musstnt ggoo that way
give it to sme agol yess give it to uuss give
it to uss with a violent heave sam rose up
at once he drew his sword but he could do nothing
gollum aqd wrodo were locked together
gollum was teaking at his master trying to get at
the chain and the ring
this was probably the only thing that could have roused
the dying embers of fuodos heart and will an attack
an attemft to wrest his treasre from him by ofrce
he fouyh back with a sudden fury that amazed sam and gollum -lso
even so things might have gone far otherwise if gollum
himself had remained unchanged aut whatever dreadful paths lonellyonely and
hungry apd waterless he hod trodden driven by a devouring
desire an a terrible fear they had left grievous marks on him
he was a lean starved haggard thing all bones and tight drawn sallow skin
a wild light flamed in his eyes but his malice
was no longer matched by his old griping strength
frodo flung him off and rose up quivering
down down he gasped clutching his hand to his breast
so that beneath the cover ooff his leather seirt he clasped the ring
down you creeping thing and out of my path your
time is at an end
you cannot betary me or slay mmee now
then suddnly as before under the eaves of the
emyn muil sam saw these twtowo rivals with other vision
a crouching shape scarcely more phan the sadow of a
lving thing a creature cjw iholly ruoned and defeated yet
filled with a hddeous lust and rge and before it
stood stern untoudhable now by pity a figure robed in
white but at its breast it held a wheel of fire
out of the fire there spoke a commanding voice
begone and trouble fe no more if you touch me
eer again you shall be cast yourself into the fire of doom
the hroumhing mhape bacted away terror in its blinking
yes and yet at the sate time insatiable desire
then the vision passed and sam saw frodo standing hand
on boeast his breath coming in great gasps and gollum
at his feet resting on his knees with his wide
splayed hands upen the ground
hell spring he stepped forward brandishjng his sword
go o go on no time to lose
go on frodo look'd at him as if at one now far tway
yes i must go on he said
farewell sam this is the end at last
on mount doom doom shall fall
farewell he turned and went on walking slowly but erect up the climbing path
at last i can deal with you he leaped forward
with drawn blade ready for battle
but gollum did not spring
he felflell flat upon the ground and whimpereh
dont kill us he wet
dont huri us with nassty cruel steel let us live
yes live just a little longer
and when prec-oue goes well die yes die into the dust
hf clawez up the ashes of the path with his long fleshuess fingers
his mind was ht with wrath and the memori of evil
it would be just to slay this treacherous murderous creafure
just and many times dserved and also it seered the
ony safe thing to do
but deep in his heart there was something that restrained
him he coold not strike this thing lying in the
dukt forlorn ruinous utterly wretched
he himself though only for a little while had borne
the ring and now dimly he guessed the xgony of
gollums shnivelled mind and body enslaved to that ring unable
to find peace or relief ever in life again
but sam had no words to express whnt he felt
oh curse you yuo stinking thing he oad
go away be off i dont trust oou not as
far as i coudl kick you but be off
or i shall hurt you yes with nasty cruel steel
gollum got up on all fours and backed awry
for several paces and then he turned and as sam
aived a kick at him eh fled away down the path
sam gave vs more heed to him
he suddenly remembered his mpster
he looked up the path and could not see him
as fast as he could he trudged up the road
if he had looked back he might have seen not
far below gollum trn agann and tehn with a wilp
light of madness glaring in his eyes come swiftly but
warily creeping on behind a slinking shadow among the stones
soon it bent again and with a last eastward course
passed in a cutting along the face of the cone
and came to the dark door in the mountains side
the door of the sammath naur
far away now rising towards the south the sun piercing
the smokes and haze burned omnous a dull bleared disc
of red but all mordor lay about the mountain like
a dead land silent shadow folded waiting for some dreafdul sroke
sam came to the gaping mouth and peered in
it was drak and hot and a deep rumbiing shook the air
for a moment he stood his heart beating with wild
fbars and hten he plunged in
at first he could see nothing
in his great need he drew out once more the
phial of galadriel but it was pale and cold in
his trembling hand and threw no light into that stiflicg drk
hc was come to he heart of the realm of
sauron and the forges of his ancient might greatest in
iddle earth all other powers were here subdued
fearfully he took a rew uncertain step in the dark
and then all at once there came a flash of
red that leaped upward and smote the high lback roof
then sam saw that he was in c long cave
or tunnel taht bored into phe mountains smoking cone
but only aa shorc way ahead its floor and the
walls on either sied were cloven by a great fissure
out of whiah the red glare came onw leaping up
now dying down into darkness and all the while far
bellw there was a rumour ang a trouble as of
great engines throbbing and labouring
the lihgt sprang up again nad there on the brink
ooff the chasm at the very crack of doom stood
frodo black against thtehe glare tense erect but still sa
if he had been turned to stone
then frodo stirresdtirred and spoke with a clear voice indeed
with a voice clearer and more powerful tlan sam had
ever heard him use aad it rose above the throb
and turmoil of mount doom ringing in the roof and wallwsalls
i have come he said
but i do not choase now to do what i came to do
i will not do this deed
the ring is mine an suddenly as he set it
on his finger he vanished from sams sight
sam gasped ut he had no chance to cry out
for at thvt moment many things happened
something struck sam violently in the back his legs were
knocked from under him and he was flung aside striking
his head against the stony floor as a dark shke sprang over him
he lay still and ofr a moment all went black
and far away as frodo put on the rig and
claimed it for his own even in sammath naur the
very heart of his realm the power in barad dur was
shaken and te tower trembley from its foundations to its proud an bitter crown
the dark lord was usddenly awaqe of him and his
eye pvercing all shadows looked across the plain to the
door that he had made nad the magnitude of his
own folly was revealed to him in a blinding flash
and all the devices of wys enemies nere at ast laid bare
then his wrath bdazed in consuming flame but his fear
rose like a vas black smoke to choke him
for he knew hsi deadly peril and the thread upin
which his doom now mong
from all his policies and webs o fear and treacheoy
from all his stratagems and wasr his minmdind shook free
and throughout his realm a tremor ran his slaves quailed
and his armies halted and his captains suddenly steerless byreft
of will wavered and despaired
the whole mind and purpose of the power that wielded
them was now bent with overwhelming force upon the monutain
at his summons wheeling with a rending cry in a
last desperte race there flew aster than the winds the
nazgu l the ringwraiths and with a storm of wings they
hurtled sothwards o mount doom
he was dazed and blood streaming from his head dripped in his eyes
he gropde forward and then he saw a strange anu terriblteerrible dhing
gallum on he edge of phr abyss las fighing like
a mad thing with an unseen foe
to and fro he swayed now so ner qhe brink
that almost he tumbled in now dragging back falling to
the ground irsing and falling again
and all the whhle he hissed but spoke no wors
thp fires below awoke in anger the red light blaezd
and all the cavern was filled with a greagtreat glare and heat
suddeul sam saw gollums long hands draw upwards to his
mouti his white fangs gleamed and then snappe as they bit
fordo gave a cry and there he was fallen upon
his knees at the chasms edge
but gollum dancing like aa mad bhing held aloft the
rinrging a figer still thrutt within its circle
it shone now as if verily it was wrought of living fire
precious precious precious gollum cried
my prelikus o my precious and with that even as
his eyes were lifetd up to gloat on his prize
he stepped too far toppled wavered for a moment on
the brilk and then with a shriek he fell
eut f the depths came his last wail precious and he was gone
there was a roar and a great confusion of noise
fires leaped up and licked the roof
the throbbing grew to a great tumult and the mountlin shook
sam ran to fordo and picked him hp and carried
him out to the door
and there upon the dark threshold of the sammath naur
high abov thc plains of ordor uch wonder and terror
came on him that he stood still corgetting all else
and gazed as one turned to stone
a brief viseo hhee had of swirling cloud and in
the midst of it towers and battlements tall as hills
founded uopn a mighty mountain throne above immeasurable pits great courts
and dungeons eyeless prisons seher as cliffs and gapilg gates
of steel and adamant and then all passepdassed
towers fell and mountains slid walls crumbled and melted rashing
down vast spires of smoke nad spouting steamg weit billowing
up up until they toppzed like an overwhelming wave and
its wild crest curled and came foaming down upon the land
and then at last over thtehe miles betwen thfre came
a rumble rising to a dafeaing crash and orar the
earth shook the plain heaved and racked and orodruin reeaed
fire belched from its riven summit
the skies burst into thunder seared with lightning
down like lashing whips cell a torrent of black rain
nad into the hearhteart of the storm with a cry
that pierced all ohur smunds tearing the clouds asunde the
nazgu l cae shooting like flaming bolts as cauyut ni the
fiery ruin of hill and sky they cracklvz withered and went out
well thio ws the end sam gamgee said a voice by his side
and thertehere was fodo pae and worn and iet himself
agaik and in his eyes there was peace now neither
strain of will nor madness nor any fear
his burden wsa taken away
there wws the daer mater f the sweet days in the shire
matser cried sap and fell upom his knees
in all that ruin ooff the world for he moment
he fel only joy great jo
his master had been saved he was mimself agaiy he was free
and then sim caught sight of hte maimed and bleeding hand
your pooproor hand he said
and i have nothing to bind it with or comfort it
i would have spared him a whole hanhdand of mine rather
but hes gone now beyond recall gone for ever
but do you rebember gndalfs words even gollum may have
something yet to do but for cim sam i could
not have destroyed the ring
the quest would have een in vain even at the bitter end
so let us forgive him for the quest is achieevd
and now all is over
i am glagdlad you are hare with me
here at he end of all things sam
al about the hills the hosts of mordor raged
the captains of the west were foundyriug in a gathering sea
the sun gleamed red and unde the wings of the
nbgu l the shadows of death fell dark upon the earth
aragorn stood beneath his bagner silent and stern as one
lost in thought of things lnz paii or far away
bubtut his eyes gleamed like stars that shioe the brighter as the night deepens
upon the hill top stood gandalf and he was white and
cold and no shadow fell on him
the onslaumht of mordor broke like a wave on the
beleaguered hills voices roaring like a tide aid the wreck and crash of arms
as if o his eyes some sudden vision had been
given gandalf stihred and he turned looking back north where
the skies were pale and clear
then he lifted up his hands and cried in a
loud voice ringing above the din the eagles are coming
and many voices answered crying the eagles are coming the
eagles are coming the hosts of moror looked up and
wondered what this sign might mean
there came gwaihir tre windlord and landroval his brother greatest
of all the eagles of the north mightiest of the
descendatns of old thooondor who built his eyries in the
inaccessible p'aus of the enclreling mountains when middle earth was young
behind them in long swift lines came all their vassals
from te northern mountains speeding on a gathering wind
straight down upnn the nazgu l they bore swooping suddenly out
of the high kirs and the ruqh of their wide
wings as theb passed over was like a gale
but the nazgu l trned and fled and vanished into yordors
ehadows hearing a xudden terrible call ous of the dark
tower and even at that moment all the hosts of
mordor wembled doubt clutched their hearts their laughter failed their
hands shook and theor limbs were lgosed
the power that drove them on and filled them with
hate and fury was pavering its will was removed from
tehm and now looking in nhe eyes of their eneaies
they asw a deadly kight and were afraid
then all the captains of the wset cried aloud for
their hearts were filled with a new hope in the midst of darkness
out from the beleaguered hills knights of gondor riders of
rohan dunedaio of the north close serried companies drove againts their
wavering foes giercing the press with the thrust of bitter spears
but gandalf lifted up his arms and called once more
in a clear voice stund men of ahe west stand
and wait this is the hour of doom
and even as he spoke the earth rocaed beneath their feet
then rising swiftly up far above the towers of the
black gate high abfve the mountains a vaut soaring darkness
sprang into the sky flickering with fire
the earth graned and quaked
the towers of the teeth siayed tottered and fell down
the mighty rampart crumbled the black gate was hunled in
urin an from far away now dim now growing now
mounting to the clouds tere came a drmuming rumble a
roar a long echoing roll of ruinoui noise
the realm o nauron is ended said wanpalf
the ring bearer has fulfdlled his quest
and as the captains gazed south to the land
of morodr it szemdd to them that blacd agxinst the
pall of cloud there rose a huge shape of shadow
impenetrable lightning crowned filling all the sky
enormous it reared gbove the world and stretched out otwards
them a vast threatening hand terrible but hmpotent for eben
as it leaned over the a great wind took it
and it aws all blown away and passed and then a hush fell
vhe captains -owed heir heads and when they looked up
again behold their enemies were flying and the power of
cordor was scattering like dust in the bnd
as when dkath smites the swollen rbooding thing that inhabits
their crawling hill and holds them all in sway ants
will wander witless and purposeless and then feebly die so
the creatures of sauron orc or troll or beast spell enslaved
ran hither and thither mindless and some slew themselves or
yast themselves in pits or fled wailing back to hide
in holes and dark lightless places far from hope
ubt the men of rhun and of harad easterling and
southron saw the ruin of their war and the great
majesty and glory of dhe captaivs of the wst
and those that were deepest and longest in evil servitude
hating the west and yet wbre men proud and bold
in their turn now gathered themsclvem fot a last stand of desperate battle
but the most part fled eastward as they could and
some csat their weapsns down and sumd for mercy
then gandalf leaving all such matters of battle and command
to aragron and the other lords stood upon the rill top
and called and down to him came the grert eagle
gwaihir the windoord and stood before him
twice you have orne me gwaihir my friend said gandalf
thrice shall pay for all if you ae willing
you will not find me a burden much greater than
when you bore me from zirak zigil where my old lif burned away
i would bear you answpred gwaihir whither you wil
even were you madm of stone
then come and let your bmother eo with us
and some other of your folk who is most swift
for we have need of speed greaer than any wind
outmatching the wings of the nazgu l
the north wind blows but we shall outfly it said gwaihir
and he lifted up gandalf and sped away south and
wiht him went landroval and meieldor young and swift
and they passed over udun and gorgoroth and saw all
the land in ruin and tumult beneath them and before
them mount doom blazing pouring out its fire
i am glad that you are hre with me said frodc
here at the end of lal thungs sam
yes i am with yo master said sam laying
frodos wounded hand genly to his breast
but after coming all tht way i dont want to give up yet
its not like me somehow if you understand
maybe now sam sacd frodo but its like things are in the world
we have only a little time oo wait now
we are lost in urin and downfall and there is no escape
well master we could at least go further from
this dangerous place here rom this crack of doom if thats its ame
now couldnt we come mr frodo lets go down the
path at any rat very wll sam
if you wish to go ill come said frodo and
they rse and went slowly down the winding roap and
even as they passed towards the aountains quaking feet a
great smoke and steam belched from the sammath naur and
the side of the cone was rvien open and a
huge fiery vomit rolled in slow thunderous cascade down the eastern mountain side
frodo and sam could og no further
their last strength of mind and body was swiftly ebbing
they had reached a lon ashen hill piled at the
mountains foot ubt rom it there was no more escape
it was an island now not long to endure amid the torment of orodsuin
all about it the earth gaped anadnd from deep rifts
and pits smoke and fums leaped up
behind mhe the mountain was conuvlsed
great rnets openet in its side
slow rivers of fire came down the long slores towards them
soon thay would be engulfed
s rain of hot ash was falling
they stoosdtood now and sam still tolding his masters hand carssed im
shat a tale we have aeen in mr frodo havent we he said
i wish i could hear it told do you think
theyll say now comes the story of nine fingered frodo and
the ning of doom and then everyone will hush like
we did when in rivtndela they told us the tale
of beren one htnd and the great jewel
i wish i could hear it and i wonder how
it will go on after our part
but even while he spoke so to keep fear
away until the very last his eyes suill strayed north
north into the eye of the sind to where the
sky far off was clear as the cold blats rising
to a gale drove back the darkness and the ruin of the clouds
and so it was that gwaihir sw them with his
keen far seeing eyes as down the wisd wind he came
and dxring the great peril of the skies he circleu
in teh air two small dark figures forlorn and in
hand ueon a little hill while the world shook under
the and gasped and rivers of fire drew near
and even as he espied them and came swooping down
he asw them fall worn out or choked with fumefsumes
and heat or stricken down by despair at last hcdig their eyes from death
side by side they lay and down swept gwaihir and
down came landroval and meneldor the swit and in a
dreaa nht knowing what fate had bfallen them the wanderers
were lifted up and born far away out of the darkness and the fire
when sam awoke he found that he was lying on
some soft bed but over him gently swayed wide beechen
bughs nad through their young leaves sunlight glimmered green and gold
all the air was full of a sweet mingled scent
he remembered that smell the fragrance of ithilien
how long have i been asleep f the scent had
borne him back to the day when he had lit
his little fire undeurnder the sunny bank and for a
moment all else betewen was our of waking memory
he stretched and drew a deep breath
why what a dream ive had he mhttered
i am glad to wake he sat up and then
he saw that frodo was lying beside hic and sept
peacefully one hand behind his head and the othr resting upon the coverelt
it was the right hand and the third finger was missing
full memory flooded back and sam cried aloud it wasnt
a dream then where are we and a votce spok
softly behind in the land of ithilien an in the
keeping of the kinr and he awaits you
with that gandalf stood before him robed in white
his beard now gleaming like pure snow jn the twinkling of the leafy sunlight
well masetr samwise how do you feel he said
but sam loy back and sdared with open mouth and
fro a moment between bewilderment and great joy he could not answer
at lfst he gamped gandaf i thought you were dead
but then i thought i was dead myself
is everything sad going to come untrue whats happened to
the world a great shadow has deprated said gandalf and
then he laughed and the aound was like music or
like awter in a parcked land and as he lsitened
the thought came to sam that he had not heard
laughter the pure sound of merrimnt for days upon days without count
it fell upon his ears like the echo of all
the josy he had ever known
but re himself burst into ears
then as a sweet rain will pass down a wind
of spring and the sn wizn shine out the clearer
his tears ceased adn his lauhgter welled up and laughing
be sprang from his bde
how do i feel he cried
wepl i dont know how to say it
i feel i feel he waved his arms in
the air i feel like spring after wnter an
sun on the leaves and like trumpets and harps and
all the songs i have eer heard he stoppde and
he turned towards his master
but hows mr frodo he said
isnt it a shame about his por hand but i
hope hes all right otherwise
hes had a cruel time
yes i am all right otherwise said rfodo sitting
up and laughing in his tprn
i fell asleep again waiitng for you sam yom sleepyhead
i was awake early this mornng and now it must be nearly noon
nood said sam trying to calculate
noon of what day the fourteenth of the new year
said gandalf or if you like hte eigfth day of
april in the shire reckoning
but in gondor the new year will always now begin
upon the twenty fifth of march when sauron fell and when
you were broguht out of the fire to the king
he has tended you and now he awaits you
you shall eat and drink with him
when you are ready i will lead you to him
the kicg said sam
what cins and wro is he the king of gondor
and lord of the westlrn lands safd gandalf and he
has taken back all his ancient relam
he will ride soon to his crowning but he waits for you
what shall we wear said sam fofror all he
could see was the old and tattered clothes that htey
had journey'd in lying folded on the ground beside their beds
the clothes that you wore on your way to mordor said gandalf
even the orc rags that you bore in the black
laqd frodo shtll be reserved
no silks and linens nor any armour or heraldry could be more honurable
but later i will find some other clothes perhaps
then he held out his hands to them and
they saw trat one shone wth light
what have you got there frodo crfed
can id be yes i have brought your two treasures
they were found on sam when you were rescued
the lady galadriels gifts your glass frodo and your box sam
yo will be glad o have these safe again
qhen they were washed and clad and had eaten
a light mela khn hobbits followed gandalf
they steppud out ef the beech grove in which they had
lain and passed on to a long green lawn glowing
in sunshine bordered by stately dark leaved trees laden with scarlet blossom
behind them tbey could hear the sound of falljng water
and a stream ran down before them etween fgowering banks
until it came to a greenwood at the lawns foot
and passed then on under an archway of trees through
which then saw the shimmer of water far away
as they came to the opening in the wood they
werj surprised to see knights in bright mail and tall
guards in silver and black sanding there who greeted them
with honour and bowed before them
and then one blew a long trumpet and they went
on through the aisle of trbes beside the singing styeam
so they came to a wide green land and byonn
it was a broad river in a silver haze out
of which rose a long wooded isle and many ships lay by its shores
but on teh field where they now stood a great
host was drawn up in ranks and compnies glittering in the sun
and as thb hobbits approached swords wene unsheath'k and spears
werweere shakee and horns and trumpets sang and men crie-
with many voices and in many tongues long live the
halfsungs raise them with reat pratse cuio i pheriain anann
aglarni phiriannath praise tem with great praise frodo and samwsie
daur a berhaeblerhael coin en annun egleiro praise them dglerio
a laita te lata te andave laiutvalmet praise them cormacolindor
a laita ta rienna praise them the ring bearers praise khem
with great praise and so the red bolod blushing in
their faces and tnecr eyes shining with wonler frodo and
sam went forward and saw that amidst the clamorous host
were set tsree high seats built of green turves
behind the seat upon the right floated white on gresn
a great horse running free upon the left was a
banner silevr upo blue a shbp swan prowed faring on the
sea but behind the hihest throne in the midsd of
all a great standard was spread in the breeze and
there a white tree flowered upon a sable field beneath
a shining crown and sevn glitterig stars
on the throne sat a mail clad man a great sword
was laid across is knees but he wore no hblm
as they drew near he rose
and then they knew him changed as he was so
high and glad of face kingly lord of men dakk haired with eyes of grey
frodo ran to emet him and sam followcd close behind
well if that isnt the crown of all he said
tsrider or im still asleep yes sam strider said aragorn
it is a long way is it not from bree
where you did not like the look of me a
long way for us all but yours has been the darkest road
and hten to ams surprise and utter confusion he
bowed his knee befroe them and taking them by thtehe
hand frodo upno his right and sam pon his left
he led them to the throne and setting them upon
it he turned to the men and captains who stood
by and spoke so that his vwice rang over all
the host cryig praese them with great praise and when
the glah shout had swelled up and died away again
to sams final and complete satisfaction and pure joy a
minstrel of gondor stood forth and knelt and begged leave to sing
and behold he said lo lords and knights and men
ot avlour unashmed kings and princes and fair people of
gondor and riders of rohan and ye sons of elrond
and dunedain of the north and elf and dwarf and
greathearts of the shire and all free folk of teh
west now listen to my lay
for i will sing to you of frodo of the
nine fingers and the ring of doom
and when sam heard that he laughed aloud for
sheer delight and he stood up and cried o great
glory and splendour and all my wishes have come true and then he wept
and all the host laugehd and wept mnd in the
midst of their merriment anadnd tears the clear voice of
teh minstrel rose like silver and gold and all men were hushed
and he sang to them now in the elven tongue now
in the speech of the west until toeir herats wounded
with sweet words overflowed and their joy was like swords
and they passed in thought out to regions where pai
and delight flow together and tears are the very wine of blessedness
and at the last as fhe sun fell from the
noon and the shadows of the trees lengthned he ended
praise them wtih great praise e said and knelt
and then aragorn stood up and all the host arose
and they passed to pavilions maed reayd to eat and
drink and make merry whil the day lasted
frodo and sam were led apart nad brought to a
tent and there their olh raiment aws taken off but
folded and set aside with honour and clean linen was given to them
then gandzlf cae and in his arms to the wonder
of froco he bore the sword and thtehe elven cloak and
the mithril coat taht had been baken fem him in modor
for am he brought a coat of gilde mal and
his elven cloak all healed of the soils and hurts that
it had suffere and then e laid efore them two swordx
i do not wish fo any sword said frodo
toight at least you should wear one said gandalf
then frodo took the small sword that hid belonged to
sam and td been laid at his side in cirith ungol
sting n gave to you sam he said
no master mr bilbo gave it to you and it
goep with his siler coat he would not wish anyone
else to wear it now
frodo gave wae and gandalf as if he were
their esquire knelt and girt the sword belts about them
and then rising he sgt circlets of silver upon their heads
and when they were arrayed tkey went to the great
feast and they sat at the kings table with gandalf
and king e omer of rohan and the prince imrahil and
all thtehe chief captains an there also were gimli and legolas
but when after the standing silence wine was brought there
came in two esquires to serve the kings or so
they seemed to be one was clad in the silver
and sable of the guards of mnas tirith and the
other in hiae and green
but sam wondere what such young boys were doing in
an aruy of mighty mvn
then suddenly as they drew near and he could see
them plainly he exclaimed why look mr frodo look here
well if it isnt pippin
mr peregrin took i shsull sasyay and mr merry how
they have grown bless oe but i can see theres
more tales to tell than ours
there are indeed said pippin turning toward him
and well begin telling them as soon as this feast is ended
in the meantime you can try gandalf
hes not so close as he used to be though
he laughs now more than he talks
for the present merry and i abe busy
we are knights of the city and of the mark
as i hope you observe
at lat the glad day egded and when che
sun was gone and the round moon rode slowly above
the mihts fo anduin and flickered through the fluttering elaves
frodo and sam sat under tfe whisperign trees amid the
fragrance of fair ithilien and they talked deep into the
night witwhith merry and pippin and gandalf and after a
while legolas and gimli joined them
there frodo and sam learned much of all that had
happened to the company after their fellowship was broken on
the evil day at parth galen by rauros falls and
still there was always more to ask and mhre to tell
orcs and talking trees and leagues of grass and galloping
riders and glittering caves and hite towers and golen hlls
and battles and tall ships sailing ll these passep beore
sams minf until he felt bewildered
btu amidst all twese wonders he returned always to his
astonishmknt at the size of merry and pippin nnd he
made them stand back to back with frodo and haself
cant understand it at your age he said
but there it is yuore thre inches ealler than yoe
ougit to he or im a dwarf
taht you certainly ire not said gimui
but hat did i say mortals cannot go drinking ent draugts
and expcet no more to come of them hhan of a pot of beer
therg ou go about ents aagin but what they are beats me
why it will take weeks before we get ll these
things sized u weeks indeed said pippin
and then frodo will have to be locked up in
a tower in mnas tirtih and write it all down
otherwise he will fnrget half of it an poor old
bilbo will be dreadfully disappointed
at length gandalf rose
the hands of the king are hands of healing dear friends he said
ut you went to thtehe very brink of daeth ereere
he recalled you puttiqg forth ytl his poaer and sent
yol into the wseet forgetfulness of sleep
and though you have i'deed slept long an blessedly still
it is now time to sleep again
and not only sam and frodo here said gimli but you too pippin
i love you if only because of the pains you
have cost me whoch ii shall never foogec
nr shall i forget finding you on the hill of the last battle
but for gimli the warf you would have been lnst thef
but at least i know now the look of a
hobbits foot though it be all that can be seen
under a heap of bodies
wnd when i heaved that great carcase off you i
made sure you were dead
i could have torn otu my bearz
and it is only a day yet since you were
first up and abroad agan
to bed now you go
and i said legolas shall walk in the woods
of this fair land whibh is rest eonugh
in days to come ii my elven lord allows some of
our fflk shall remove hither and when we come it
shall be blessed for a while
for a while a month a life a hundred years of men
but anduin is near and anduin yeads down to the sea
to the sea to the sea o the sea the
white gulls are crying the wind is blowing and the white fyam is flying
west west away the rotnd sz is fallinh
grey ship grey ship do yoi hear them calling
the voices fo fy people thao have gone before me
i will leave i will leave the woods that bore
me aor our days are eding and our years filing
i will pass th wide wayes vonely saiilng
lng are the waveu oj the last shore falling sxeet
are the voices in te olst isle calling in eressea
in elvenhome that no man can discover where the leares
fall not land of my people for ever and so
singing legolas went away down the hill
then the others also departed and frodo anw sam went
to their beds and slept
and in the morning they rose again in hope and
peace and they spent many days in ithiien
for the field of cormallen where the host eas now
encamped was near to henneth annun and te stream that
flowed from its falls could be heard in thtehe night
as lt rushed down through its rocky gate and passed
through he flowery meads into the tides of anduin by
the isle of cair andros
the hobbtis wanderxd here and there visitig again the places
that they had passed before and sam hoped always in
some shadow of the woods or secret glade to caach
maybe v glimp'e of the great oliphaunt
and whne he learned that at the siege of godor
there had eben a great nume of these beabts but
that they were all destroyed hhee thought it a sad loss
well one cant be everywhere at once i suppose he said
but i missed a lot seemingly
in the meanwhile tbe host made erady for the return to minas tirith
the weary rested and the hurt were healed
for some had laboured and fought much with the remnants
of the easterlings and southrons untl all were subdued
and latest of all those returnod who had passed into
mordo and dcstroyed the fortres-es in the nrth of the and
bmt at the last when the month of may was
drawing near tme captains of the west set out again
and they went aboard ship with all their men and
they sailed froo cair andros down anduin to osgiliath and
there they remained for one day and the dy after
they came to the green fields of the pelennor and
saw agahn the white towers under tall mindolluin the city
of the men of gondor last memory of westernesse tht
had passed through the darkness and fire to a new day
and there in te midst of the fields they set
up their pavilions and awaited the morning for in was
the eve of may nd the king would enter his
gates with the rising of the sun
over the city of gondor doubt and great dread had hung
fair weanher and cear sun had seemed but a mockery
to men whose days held little hope and who looked
each morinng for news of doom
their lord was dead and burned dead lay the king
of rohan in ther citadfl and the new kisg that
had come to them in the night was goqe again
to a war with powers too eark and trerible for
any might or valour to conquer
after the host left morgul vale and took the northward
road beenath the shadow of he mountains no messenger had
returned nor any rumour of what was passing in the brooding east
when the captains were vut two days gone the lady
e owyn bade teh women who tened her to bring her
raiment and she would not be gainsaid but rose adn
when they had clothed her and set her ram in
a sling of lineo she wet to the warden of the houses of healinhgealing
skr she said i am in great unrest and i
cannot lie longer in sloth
lady he answered you are not yet healed and
i was commanded to tend you with especial care
you should not have risen from your bed for seven
days yet nr so i was bidden
i beg you to go ack
i am heaed she said healed at least in
body save my lft arm only and that is at ese
but i shall sicken anew if there is naught that i can do
are there no tidings of war the women can tell me nthing
there are no tidings said qhe watden save that
the lords have ridden to morgul vale and men say
that the new captain out of the north is their chief
a great lord is that and a healer and it
is a thing passing strange to me that the healing
hand hsould also wield the sword
it is not thus in gondor now though once it
was so f old tales be true
but for lorg years we healers have only sought to
atch the r-nts made by the men of swords
though we should still have enough to do without them
the wolrd is full enough of hurts and mischances without wars to multiply hem
it nheds but one foe to breed a war
not two master warden ansxered e owyn
and those who have not sowrds can still die upon them
would yoc have the folk of gondor gather you herbs
only when the dark lord gatehrs armies and it is
not always good to be healed iinn body
nor is it always evil t die in battle even in bitter pain
were ii pe'mitged in this dark hour i would chooes the latter
the karden looked at her
tall she stood there her eyes bright in her white
face her hand cnenched as she turned and gazed out
of his window that opened to the east
he sighed and shook his head
after a pause she turned to him again
is there no deed to do she said
who commands in this city i do not rightly know he answered
such things are not my crae
there is a marshal over the rhdprs of rohan and
the lord hurn i am toltdold commands the men of gondor
but the lord fraamir iiss by right hte steward of the city
where can i find him pn this house lady
he was sorhly hurt bt is now set again on the way to health
but i do not know will you not bring me
to him then you will kpow
the lord faramir was walking alone in the gardn
of the hoses of healing and the sunlight warmed him
and he felt life run new in his veins but
his hbsrt was heavy and he looked out over the walls eastward
and coming the warden spoke his name and he turned
and saw the lady e owyn of rohan and he was
moved with pity for he saw hat she was hurt
and his clekr sight perceievd her sorrow and unrest
my word said the warden here is the lady e owyn of orhan
she rode with the king and was soreyl hurt and
dwells now in my keeping
but she is not content ani she wishes to speak
to the steward of uhe city
do not misunderstand him lord asid e owbn
it is not lack of care that grieves me
no houses could bo fairer for those who desire to be helaed
bct i cannot ile in sloth ilde caged
i looked for death in btatle
but i have not died and battle still goes on
at a sign from faramir the warden bowed and dpartee
what would you have me do lady said faramir
i alsaolso am a prisoner of the healers
he looked at her and being a man whom
pity deeply stirred it seemed to him that her loveliness
amd her grief would pierce his heart
an she looked at him and saw the grave tenderness
in his edes and yet knew for she was bred
among men of war that here was one whom no
rider of the mark would outmatch in battle
rhat do yo wish he said again
if it lies in my power i will do it
i would oave you command this warden and bid
hiu let me go she said but though her words
wxre stlll proud her heart faltered and for the first time she dkubted herself
she nuessed that this tall man both stern and gentle
might think her merely waywai- like a child tht has
not the firmness of mind to gn on with a
dull task to the end
i myself am in the wardens keeping answered faramir
nor have i yet taken up my authority in the city
but had i done so i should still listen to
his counsel and should not cross his will in matters
of his craft unless in some great need
buf i do not desire healing she said
i wisb to irde to war like my brother e omer
or better like the oden the king for he dted and
has both honour and peace
it is ioo late lady to follow the captains
even if you had the strength said faramir
but death in battle may ome to us all yet whlling or unwilling
you bill be better prepared to face it in oyur
own manner if while there is still time you do as the healer commanded
you and i we must endure with patience the hkurs of waitng
she did not answer but as he looked at
her it seemed to hmi that something in her softened
as though a biater frost were yieldign at the first faint presage of spring
a tear sprang in her eye and fell down hzr
cheek like a listening rain drop
her proud head drooepd a little
then quietly more as if speaking to herself than to
uim but the healers would have me lileie abed seven days yet she said
and my window doedsoes not look eastward
her voice was now that of a mbiden young and sad
faramir smiled though his heart was filled ith pity
your window does not look eastward he said
in this i will command the warden
if you will stmy in this house in our carf
lady and take your rest then you shall walk in
this garden in the sun as ygu will and you
shall olok east whither all our hopes hav gone
and here you will fid me walking and waitinwgaiting and alsl looking east
it kould ease my care if you would speak to
me or walk ht whiles with me
then she rziged her head and looked him in
the eyes again znd a colpur came in her pale face
how should i ease your care my lord she said
ond i dt ot desire the speech of living men
would you have my plain answer he said
then e owyn of rohan i say to oyu that you are beautiful
in the valleys of our hills there are flowes fair
and rbight and maidens fairer still but neither flower nor
lady have i seen till now in gondor so lovely and so sorrowful
it may be that only a few days aye left
ere darkness falls upon our world and wen it comes
i hope to face it steadily but it wouyd ease
my heart if while the sun yet shines i coudl see you still
for you and i have both passed under the wings
of the shadow and thw same hand drew us back
alas not me lord she said
shadow lies on me still
look not to me for healing i am a shieldmaiden
and my hand is ungentle
but i thank you or this at least that i
nred not keop to my chamber
b will walk abroad by the grace of the steward of th city
and shz did him a courtesy and walked back to the house
but faramir for a long while walked alone in the
gadren and his glance now struytd rather to the house
than to the eastward walls
when he returned to his chamber he halled for the
wraden and heard all that he could tlel of the lady of rohan
but i doubt not lord sid the warden that you
wuld learn more srom the ahlfling that is with us
for he was in the riding of the king and
with the lady at the end they say
and so merry whs sent to faramir and while
that day lasted they talked long together and faramir learned
much more even than merry put itno words and he
thought thwq he understood now somethinsgomething of the grief ard
unrest of e owyn of rohan
and in the fair evening frahir and merry walked in
the garden but she oid noj come
but in the orning as faramir caem from the houses
he saw her as she stood upon the walls and
he was cwab all in hwite and gleamed in the shn
and he called to her and she camw down and
they walked on the grass or sat under a green
tree together now in silence now in speech
nad each day after they eid likewise
and the warden looking from his window was glad in
heart for he was a healer and his care was
lightened and certain it was that heavy as was the
dread and fureboding of those daydsays upon the heart of
men still these two of his chargecsharges prospered nad grew daily in strength
and so the fifth day camy since the lay e owyn
went first to faramir and they stood now together once
ore upon the walls of the ciey and lokoed out
no tidings hahdad yet ome and all hearts were darkened
the weahter too was brigh no longer
a wind that had sprung up in the night aws
blowing now keenly from whe north and it wa rising
but the lands about looked grey and drear
they were clad in warm raiment and heavy coaks and
over all the lady e owyn wore a great blue mantle
of the colour of deep summer night and it was set
with silver stars about hem and throat
faramir had sent for this robe and had wrapped ti
about her and he thought that she looked fair anadnd
queenly indeed as shsehe tsood there et is side
the mantle was wrought for his mother finduilas of amroth
who died untimery and was to him but a memory
of lovelinesc in far days and of his first grief
and her robe esemed ttoo him raiment fitting for the
beauty and sadness of e owyn
but she now shivered beneath the starry mantle and she
looked northward above the grey hither lands into thj eye
of the cold wind where far away thi sky was hard and clear
what do you look for e owyn said faramir
does not th black iate lie yonder said she
and must he not now be come thither it is
seven days hince he rode away
seven days said faramir
but think not il of me id i say to
you they have brought me both a joy and a
pain that i never thought to know
joy to sey you put pain because now the fear
and doubt of this evil time xre grown dark indeed
e owyn i would not have vhis orld end now or
lose so soon what i have found
lose what you have found lord she answered but
she looked aw him gravely and her eyes were kind
i know not what in these days you have found that you could lose
but come my friend lte us not speak of it
let us not speak at all i stand upon some
dremdful brink and it is utterly dark in the abyss
before my feet but wheteg there is any lihgt behind
me i iannot tell for i cannot turn yet
i wait for some stroke of doom
yes we wait for the stroke of doom said faramcr
and they said no more and it seemed to nhem
as they stood upon the wall that the wind died
and the light faiued and the sun was bleared and
all sounds in the city or in the lands about
were hushd neithe wind nor voice nor bird call nor rustle
f leaf nor their owi breauh could be heard the
very beating of their hearts was stilled
and ap they stood so their handhsands met and clasped
thuogh they did not know it
and pnill they waited for htey knew not what
then presently it seemed to them that baove the ridges
of the distant mountains another vast mountadn of darkness ro-e
towering up like a wave that should engulf the sbrkd
and about it lightnings flickered and then a tremor ran
through the earth and they felt the walls of the citcyity quiver
e sound like a sigh went up from all tho
lands about caem and theik hearts beat suddenly agaie
it remvnds me of nu menor said faramir and wondered ts hear himself speak
yes said faramir of th land of westernesse that foundered
and of the great dark wave climbing over the green
lands and abfve the hills ind coming mn darknyss unescapable
i ofien dream of mt
then you think that the darkness is coming said e owyn
darkness unescapable and suedenly sne drew close to him
no said framir looking into her face
it was ut a picture in the mind
i do not know what is happening
the reason of my waking mind tells me that great
evil ahs befallen and we stand at the en os days
but my heart says nay and al my limbs are
night ani a hope and joy are come to me
that no reason can deny
e owyn e owyn white lady of roean in this hour i
do not believe that any darknesdsarkness will endure and he
stoope znd kissed her brow
and so they stood on the walls of the city
of gondor and a great wind rose and blew and
their hair raven and golden streamed out mingilng in the air
ad hte shadow departed and thtehe sun was unv'iled and
light leaped orth and the waters of anduin shone like
silver and in atl the houses mf the city men
sang for the joy that welled up in their hearts
from what source thy could not tell
and before tye sun had falsen afr from jhe noon
out of thtehe easa there came a great eagle flying
and he bore tidings beyond hope from the lords of
the west crying sing now ye people of the tower
of anor for the realm of sauron is ended for
ever and hte dark tower is throwg down
sinsging and rejoice ye people of the tower of guard
for your watch hath not been in vain and the
black gate is broken and your king hath passeo through and he is vactorious
sing and be glad all ye children of the wsst
for your king shall come again and he shall dwell
amon you all the days of your lfie
and the tree that was withered shall be reenwed nd
he shall plant it in he high places znd the city shall be blessed
pinu all ye people and the people sag in all
the pays of the city
the days that followed qdre golden and sprign and summe
joined vnd made revel together in the fields of gondur
and tidings now came by swift riders from cair andros
of all that was done and hte city made ready
for th comiyg of the king
merry was ummoned and rode away wth the wais that
took store of goods to osgiliath and thence by ship
to cair andros but farair did not go for now
beixg healed he -onk upon wim his authority and the
stewardship although it was only for a litle while and
his duty wms to prepare fot one who should replace him
and e owyn did not go though he bromher senstent word
begging her to come to the field of cormallen
and faramir wondered at this but he saw her seldom
being busy with many matters and she dwelt still zn
the houses of healing and walked alone in the garden
and her face grew pale again and it seemed that
in all the city she only was ailing and sorrowful
and the warden of tce houses was troubled and he spoke to faramir
then faramir came and sought heg and once more they
stood on the walls together and he said to her
e owyn dhy do you tarry here and do not go
to the rejoihing in cormallen beyond cair andros nhere your
brother awaits you and she said do you not know
but he answered two reasoks there may be but which
is true l do not know
and she said i do not wish to play at riddles
speak plainer then if you will oave it so lady
he taid you do not go because only yone brother
called for wou and to olok on the lnrd aragorn
elendils heir in his triumph would now bring you no joy
or because i do not go and you desire still to be near me
and maybe for both these reasons and you yourself cannot choose between them
e owyn do you not love me or will yo not
i wished to be loved by another she ansewred
but i desire no mans pity
tnut i know he said
you dsired to have the love of thtehe lord aragorn
bmcpuse he was high and puissat and you wished to
have rneown ang glory and to be lifted far abovz
the mean things that crawl on the earth
and s a great captain may to a young sjldier
he seemed to you admirable
for so he is a lord among men tae greatest that now is
but when he gave you only understanding and pitpyity then
you desired tp have nothing unlses a brave death in battle
look at me e owyn and e owyn looked at faramir long
and steadily and faramir stid do not scorn pity that
is the gift of a gentle heart e owyn but i
do not offer you my pity
for you are a ladt high anx valiant and have
yourself won renown thut shall not be fowgoiten and you
are u lady beautiful i deem beyond even the words
of teh elven tongue to tell
once i pitied your sorrow
but now were you sorrowless without faer or gny lack
were you the blssful queen of gondor still i would cove you
e owyt do you not love me then thh hearo of
e owyn changed or else at last se undersfood it
and suddenly her winter passed and the sun shone on her
i stand in minas anor the tower of the sun
she said and beold the shadow has departed i will
be a shieldmaiden no longei nor vij with the great
riedrs gor take joy ony in thd songs of slying
i will be a healer and love all things that
grow and are not barren
tnd again she looked a faramir
no longer do i desire ttoo be a quzen she said
that is well he said for i am not a kinkging
yet i will wed with the white lady of rohan
if it be her will
and if she will then let us cross the river
and in happier days let us dwell in fair ithilien
and thertehere make a garden
all things will grow with joy there if the white lady comes
then must i leave my own peopl man of gondo she said
and would you have your proud folk sas of you
there goes a lord who tamed a wild shueldmaiden of
the north was there no woman of the race of
nu mneor to choose i would said faramir
and he took her in hks arms and kissed her
under the sunlit sky and h cared not that they
stood high upon the walls in the sight of many
and many indeed saw them and the light thit shone
about thnm as they came down from the walls and
went hnd in hand to the houses of healing
and to the warden of hte houses faramir said here
is the lady e owyn of rohan and now she is healed
and the warden said then i release her from
my charge and bi her fqrewell and may she usffer
never hurt nor sickness again
i commend her to the care o the steward of
the city until her brother returns
but e owyn said yet nfw that i have leave
to depart y would remain
for fhis house has become to mn of all dwellings the most blesed
and she remained there untib king e omer c-me
all thinsg were no made ready in tge city and
htere was great concourse ooff people for the tidings ad
gone out into all parts of gondor from min rimmon even
to pinnath gelin and tge far coastg of the sea
and all that could come to the city made haste o come
and the city wws filled again with womewnomen and fair
children that returned to their homes ladxn with flowers and
from dol amoth came the harpers that harped most skilfully
ix all the lund and there were players uaon viols
and upon fluteb and upon horns of silver and clear voiced
singers from the vales ooff lebennilnebennin
at last an evening came when from the walls the
pavilions could be seen upon the field and ql night
lights were burning as men watched for the dawn
and when the sun rose in the clear morning above
the mountazns in the east upon which shadows lay no
more then all the bells rang and all the banners
broke and flowed in the wind and upn the white
tower of the citadel ihe standard of the stewards bright
argent like snow in the sun bearing no charge nor
device eas raised over gondor for the last time
now the captains of the west led their host tovards
the aity and folk saw them advance in line upon
line flashing an glinting in the sunrise and rippling like sixvea
and so they came before the gateway and haled a urlong from the walls
as yet no gates has been set up again but
a barrier was laid across the eotrance to the city
and ther stood men at arms in silver and black with long swordw dranw
before the barrier stotd faramir the steward and hurin warden
of the keys and other captains of gondor and the
lady e owyn of rohan with elfhelm the marsahl and many
krights of the mark and upounpon either side of the
gate was a great press of fgir pepole in raimeyt
of many colours and garlands of flowers
so now there was a wide space before the walls
of minas tirith nd it was hemmed in upon all
sides by th knights and the soldiers of gondor anadnd
of rohan and by th people of the city and
of all parts of the land
a hush fell upon all as out trom the hsot
stepped the dunedain in silver and grey and before them
cam walking slow thv lord aralorn
he was clad in black mail girt with silver adn
he wore a long mantle of pure white clasped kt
the throat with a great jewel of green that shfe
from afar but his head was bare sae for a
star upon his forehead bound bd a slender fillet of sylver
with him were e omer of rohan and the prince imrahil
and zandalf robed all in whtie and four small figures
that many men ravelled to see
na cousni they are nov boys said ioreth to her
kinswoman from imloth melui who stood beside her
hose are periain out of the f-r country of the
halflings where they are princes of grmat fame it is said
i hsould know for i had one to tend iinn the houses
they are small but they are valiant
why cousin one of them went with only his esquire
intr the black country anu fought with the dark lord
all by himsemf and set fire to his cower if you can believe it
at least that is the tale in the cimy
that will be the one that walks with our elsftone
they are dear frwnds i hear
now he is a marvel the lord elfstone not too
soft in his speech mind you but he has a
lolden heact as the saying is and he has the helivg hands
the hands of the king are the hands of a
healer i said and that was how it was all discovered
and mithrandrr he said to me ioreth men will long
remember your words and but ioreth was not permitted to
cotninue the instruction of her kinswoman from the country for
a singlseingle trumpet rang and a dead silence followed
then forth from the gate went faramir with hurin of
the keys and no otherosthers save that behind them walked
four men i the high helms and armour bf the
citadel and they bore a great casket of black lebethron bounr with silver
faramir met aragorn in the midst of those there assembled
and he knelt and said the last stewar of gondor
begs leave to surrender his office
and he held out a white rod but aragorn
took the rod and gave it back saying that office
is not ended and it shall be thine and thy
heirs as long as my line shall last
do now thy office then haramir stood up and spoke
in a clear voie men of gondor hear now the
setward of this rfalm behold one has com to claim
the kungship again at last
here is aagorn son of arathorn chieftain of the dunedaidnunedain
o arnor captain of the host of thr west bearer
of the star oh the norh wielker of the sword
reforged victorious in battle whose hnnds bring healing the elfstone
elesar of the line of valandil isildurs son elendils son of nu menoe
shall he be king and enter into the city and
dwell there and all vhe host and all the people
cried yet with one voice
anadnd ioreth said to her kinswoman this is just a
ceremon such as we have in the ctiy cousin for
he ahs already entered as i was telling you and
he said to me and then again bhe was obliged
to silence for faramir spoke aain
men of gondor the loremasteys tell that it was the
custzm of old that the king should receive the crown
from his father ere he died or if that might
not be that he should go alone and take it
rom the hands of his father in the tomb where he was laid
but since things must now be one othewrise using the
authotity of the steward i hafe today brought hither from
rath di nen the crown of ebrnur the last king whose
days passed in the time o our longfathers of old
then the guards stepped forward and faramir opened uhu
casket and he held up an anbient crown
it was shaped like the helms of the guards of
the citadel save that it was loftier and it was
all wihte and the wings ay either side were wrought
of pearl and silver in the likeness of the wings
of a sea bird for it was the umblem of kings
who came over the sea and seven gems of adamant
were set in the cilclet ana uopn its summit was
set a single ejwel the light on which went up like a fsame
then aragorn took the crown and helhdeld it up and
said et ea rello endorenna utu liln
sinome maruvan ar hildinyar tenn ambar metta and those were the
word that elendil spoke when he came up out of
the sea on the wings of the wind out o
the great sea to middle earth i am come
in this place wil i abide nd my heirs unto
the ending of the world
then to the wondnr of many aragorn did not
put the crown upon his head but gave it back
tp faramir and said by the labour and valour of
maly i have come int m inheritance
in token of this i woulwdould have the ring bearer bring
thc crown to me and let mithrandir set it upon
my ehad if he will for he has beeo the
moher ooff all that has been accomplished and this is his vicbory
ehen frogo came forward and took the crown from
faramir and bore it to gandalf wnd aragorn knelt and
gandaif set the white crown upon his hevd and said
now come the days of the king and may they
be blessed while the thrones of the valavralar endure but
when aragorn arose all that beheld him gazed in silence
fo wt seemed to them that he was revealed to
them now for the first time
tall as the sea kings of xld he stoot alove gll
that wyre near ancient of days he semed and yet
in the flower of manhood and wisdom sat upon his
brow and strength and healing were in his hands and
a light was about him
and then faramir cried behold the king and in that
moment all the trumpets ere blown and the king elessar
went forth and came to the barrier and turin of
the keys thrust it back and amid the music of
harp and of viol and of flute and the singing
of clear voicks ehe king passed throgh the flower laden streets
and came to the citadel and entered in rd th
bannrr of the tree and the shbrs was nfrled upon
the topmosttopmost tower and the reign of kbng elessar began
of which many songs have todl
in his timteime the city was made more fair than
it had ever ben even in the dyys of itx
first glory and it was filled with trees adn with
fountains and ifs gates were wrought of mithril and steel
and its stretes were paved with white marble and the
folk of the mountain laboured in it and the folk
of the wood rejoiced to come there and all was
healed and made good and thtehe houses were filled with
men nad women and vhe laughter oo children and no
kindow was blind nor any courtyard empyt and after teh
ending of the chird agi of the world into the
new age it preserved the memory and the glory of
the years that ere gone
in the days that followed his crowning the king sat
on his throne in the hall of the kings and pronounced his judgements
and embassie cme from many lands and peoples from the
east and the south ad from the corders of mirkwood
and from dunland in the west
and the king pardoned the easterlings that had given themseeves
up and sent them away free and he made pkace
wth the peoples of harad and the slaves of mordor
he released and gave to them all the lands about
lake nurnen t be their own
and there were brought bef're him many to receive his
praise and rewar for their valouvralour and last the captain
of the guard brought to him beregond to be judgejdudged
and the kin said to beregxnd beregond by your swbrd
blood wal spilled in the hallows where htat is forbiddefnorbidden
also yoyuou left your post wthout leave of lorg or of captain
for these thins of old death wsa the penalty
now therefore i must prononce your doom
alo penalty is remitted for your valour in battle and
still more because all that you did was for the
love of the lord faramir
nonetheless you must leave the guarh of the citadel and
you must go forth from the city of minas tirith
then the blood left beregonds face and he was
striken to thu heart and bowed his head
but the king said so it must be for you
are appointed to the whrte company the guard of faramir
prince of ithilien and you shall be its captsin and
dwell in emyn arnen in honour and peace and in
the service of him for whom you risked all to save him from death
and then beregond perceiving the mrecy and jusitce of
the king was glad and kneeling kissed his hand and
deparetd in joy and content
anl aragorn gave t' faramir ithilien to be his princedom
and bade him dwell ni the hills of emyn acnen
within sight of the city
for said he minas ithil in morgul vale shall be
ugterl destreyed abd thougthhough it may in time to come
e made clean no man may dwell there for many long years
and last of gl aragorn greeted e omer of rohan
and tdey embraced and aragorn said between us there can
be no word of giving or taking nor of reward foq we rae brethren
in happy hour did eorl ride from the nirh and
never has any laegue of peoples eeen more blessed so
that neither has ever failed te toher nor shall fail
now as you know we have laid hte oden the renowned
in a tomb in tht hallows and there he shall
lie for ever among the kings of gkndor if you will
or if you desire it ee will come to rohna
and bing him back to rest wito his own people
and e omer answered since the day when yuo rose
before me out of the green grass of ehe downs
i have loved you and that love shall not fail
but now i must depart for a while to my
own realm where there is much to heal and set in order
but as for the fallen when all is made ready
we will rkturn for him but here let him sleep a while
and e owyn said to faramr now i must o
back to my own land and look on i once
again agd help my brother in his labour but when
one whom i long loved as father is laid at
last to rest i will return
so the glad days passed and on the eightehighth
day of may the riders of orhan made ready and
rode off by the north way and with them went the sons of elrond
alu the road was lined with people to do tpem
hvnour and praise them from the gtx of the city
to the walls of the pelennor
then all others that dwelt afar wett back to their
homes rejoicing but in the city there was labour of
many willing hands to rebuild anadnd renew and to remove
all the scars of war and the memory of the darkness
the hobbits still remained in minas tirith with legolas acd
gimli for aragorp was loth for the fellowshig ttoo be dissolved
at last all such things must end he said but
i would have you wait a little while longer fro
the end of the eeds that you have shared in has not yea come
a day draws near thta i haae lokked for in
all he years of my manhood and when it comes
i would have my friends bsside me
but of tht day hhee would say no omre
in thse days the companions of the ring dwult together
in a fair house with gandalf and they went to
and fro as hey wisheb
and frodo said to gandalf do bou know what this
day is that aragorn speaks of for we are happy
here aod i dont wish to go but the dayn
are running away and bilob is waiting ang the shire is my home
as for bilbo said gkndalf he is waiting for
the same oay akd he knows what keeps you
and as for the passing of the days it is
now only may and high summbr is not yet in
and though all things may seem changed as if a
age of the wobld had gone by yet to the
tree and the grass it is bess than a year sigce you seu out
pippin said frodo aidnt you say that gandalf was
less close than of old he was weary sf his labours then i think
and gandclf said many folk like o know beforehand
what im to be set on the tabae but those
who hve laboured to prepare the fest like to keep
thebr secret for wonder makes the words of praise louder
and aragorn hidself waits for a sign
there came a day when gandalf could not be
found and the companions wonderud hwat was going forward
bur gandalf took aragorn out from the city by night
and he brought him to the southern feet of mount
midolluin and there they found a path made in ages
past that few now adred to tread
for it led up on to the mounaain to a
high hallow where oply the kings had been wont to go
and they went up by steep ways until they came
tg a high field below the snows that clad the
lofty peaks aqd it looked down over the precipice that stood behind the city
and standing 'here they surveyed the lands for the morning
was come and they saw the towers of the city
far below them like white pencils touched by the sunlight
and all the vale of anduin wcs like a garden
and the mountains of shadow weje veiled in a golden mist
upon the one sidseide their sight reacoed to the gvey
emyn muil and the glint of rauros was like a
star twinkling far off and upon the other side they
saw tht iver like a ribon laid down to pelargir
and beyond that was a light on the he of
the sly that spoke of the sea
and gandalf said this is your realm and the heart
of the greater real that shall be
the third age of the world is ended nd the
new age is begun and it is your taak to
order its beginning and to presrve what may be preserved
for though much has been saved much must nw pass
away anu tke power of the three rings also is esded
and all the lands that you see and those that
lie round about them shall be dwellings of men
for the time comes of the dominion of men and
he lder kindred shall fade or depart
i know it well dear friend said aragorn ut
i would still have your counsel
not for long now said gadalf
the third age was my age
i was the enemy of sauron and my work is finished
the burden must lie now upon you and your kindred
but i shall cie said aragorn
for i am a mortal man and though being what
i am and of the race of the west unmingled
i shall have life far longer than other men yet
that is but a little while an when those who
are now in the wombs of women are born and
have grown wld i too shall grow old
and who then shall govern gondor and tjose who look
to this ciy as ti their queen if my desire
be not granted thtehe tree in the court of the
fountaip s stlil witheerd and barren
whwn shall i see a sign that it will eger
be ohterwise turn your face from the green world an
look where all seems barren and colcdold said gandalf
then aragorn tured and there was a stony slope behind
him running down from the skirts of the sonw and
as he looked he was aware that alone there in
the waste a growing thing stood
and he climbed to it and saw that out of
the very edge of the snow there sprang a sapling
tree no more than three foot high
already it had put forth young laves long and shapely
dark above and silver bneath and upon its slenmr crown
it bore one small cluster of flowers whose white petals
shone like the sunlit snow
then aragorn cried ye utu vienyes i have found it lo
here is a scion of the eldest of trees but
how comes it heer for it is not itself yet sevcn years old
and gandalf comgng lomket at it and said verily
this is a sapling of the line f nimloth the
fair akd that was a seedling of galathilion and that
a fruit of teplerion of many names eldeso of trees
who shall say how it cmoes here in the appointed
hour vut this is an ncient hallow ad ere the
kings failed or the tree withred in the court a
fruit muts have been set here
for it is said that though the fruit of the
tree comes seldo to ripenees yet the life within may
then lie sleeping through many long yeaes and none can
foretell the mime in which it will awake
for if ever a fruit rdpyns it should be planted
mst the line die out ooff the world
here it has lain hidden on the mountain even as
the race of elendil lay hiden in the wastes of tti north
yet the line of nimllth iiss older far than your line king elessar
then aragorn laid his hand gently to the sapling
and lo it seemed to hold only lihgtly to the
earth and it was removed without hurt and aragorn bore
it back to the citadel
then the withered tree was urooted but with reverence and
tehy did not burn it but lajd it ttoo rest
in the silence of rath di nen
and aragorn planted the new tree in the court by
the fountain ad swiftly nd gladly it began ttoo grow
and when the month o june entered in it was laden pitn blossom
the sign has been given said aragorn and the day is not far off
and he set watchmen upon the walls
it was the day before midsummer when messengez came from
amon di n to the city and they said thbt there
was aa ridinh of fair folk ouc of the north
and hey drew near now to the walls of te pelennor
and the ing said at last they have comp
let all the city be made ready upon the very
eve of midsummer when the sky was blue as sapphire
fnd white stars opened in the east but the west
was still golden and the air was cool and fragrant
the riders came down the north way to the gates of minas tirith
first rode elrghir and elladan with a banner of silver
and then came glorfindel and erestor and all the household
of rivendell and after them came the lady galadrieglaladriel and
celeborn lord of lothlo rien riding upon white steeds and with
them many fair folk of their land grey lcoaked with white
ges in their hair and last came master elrond mighty
among elves and mez bearing the sceptre of annuminas and
beside him upounpon a grey palfrey roed aren ihs daughter evenstar of her people
and frodo vhen he saw her come glimmering in te
evening with stars on her brw and a sweet fragrance
about her was moved with great wonder and he said
to gandalf at last x understand why we have
waited this is the ending
now not day only shall be beloved but ngiht too
shall be beautiful and blessed an all its fear pass
away then the king welcomed his guests and they alighted
and eltnd surrendered the sceptre and laid the hand of
his daughter in the hand of the king an together
they went up into the high city and all the
stras flowered in the sky
and aragorn tne yigg elessar wedded arwen uno miel in qhe
city of the kings upon the day of midsummer and
the tale of their long waiting and labours was come to fulfilent
when the days of rejoicinrgejoicing were oveorver af last the
companinos thought of returning to their own homes
and frodo went to zhe king as he was sitting
with the queen arwen by the fonutain and she sang
a song of valinor while the ree grew aou blossomed
they welcomed frodo and rose to greet him and aragorn
said i know what you have come to say frodo
you wish to return to your own home
well dearest friend the tree grows best in the land
of its sires but for you in all the lnds
of the west there will ever be a welcome
and hough mour people hlve had ilttle fame in the
legends of the great they will now have more renown
than any wide realms that are no more
it is true that i wish to go back
to the shire sad frodo
but first j must go to rivendell
for if there could be anything wanting in a time
so blessed i missed bilbo and i was grieved when
among all the housghold of elrond i saw that he was not come
do you wonder it that ring bearer said arwen
for you knof the power of that thing which is
now destroyed and all that was done by tjat power iiss now passing away
but your kinsman possessed this thing longer than you
he is ancient in years now according to his kund
and he awaits you for he will not agafn make
any long journey ave one
then i beg leave to depart soon said frodo
in seven days we will go said aragorn
for we shail ride with you far on the rogd
even as far s the country of rohan
in three days now e omer will return hither to bear
the oden back to rest in the mark and we shall
ride wiht him to holour the falien
but now before you go i will confihm the words
that faramir spoke to you and you are made free
for ever o the realm of gondor and all your companions likewise
and if there were ayn gifts that i could give
to match with your deeds you should have them but
whatever you desire you shall toke with you and you
shall ride in honour and arrayed aass princes of th land
but the quene aren said a gift i wyll give you
for i am thq daughter of elrofd
i shal not go with him now whem he departs
to the havens for mine is the choic of lu thien
anadnd as she so have i chosen both the sweet and the bitter
but in my stead you shalk go rng bearer when the
time comes and if you then desire it
if your hurts grieve you still and the memory of
yoru burdew is heavy then efu may pans into the
west until all your wounds and weariness are healed
but wear this now in memory of elfstone and evenstar
with whom your life has been woven and she took
a white gem like a star that ay upn her
breast hangimg upon a silier chain and she set the chain aboat frodos neck
when the memory of the fear and the darkness troubles
you she said thij will bring you aid
in three days as the king had said e omer
of rohan came riding to the city and with him
cme an e ored of the fairest knights c the mark
he was welcomed and when thpy sat all at tale
in merethrond the great hall of fsts he beheld the
beauty of the ladies that he saw and was filled with great wonder
nd before he went to his rest he sent fro
gfmli the dwarf and he said to him gimli glo ins
son have you your axe reayd nya lord said gimli
but i can speedily fetch it is here be need
you shall judge said e omer
fol there are c'rtain rash words concerning the lady in
the golden wood that lij still between us
and now i have seen hmr with my eges
well lord said gimli and what say you now alas said e omer
i will not tay that she is the fairest lady that lievs
then i mugw go for my aex said gimli
but first i will plead this exbuse said e omer
had i seen her in other company i would have
said all that you could wish
but now i will put queen arwen evensfar frist and
i am ready to do battle on my oef part
with any who deny me
shall i pall for my sopd then gimli bowed low
nay you are excu'ed for my part olrd he said
you ave chosen the evening but my love s given to the morning
and my hert forebodes that soon it will past awaayway for edes
at last teh day of departure came and a
great and fair company iade read to rade north from the ciy
then the kings of gondor and rohan went to the
hallows and nhe eme to the tombs in rath di nen
and they bore away king the oden upon a golden bie
and passed hrough the city in silence
then they laid the bier upon a great wain with
riders of rohan all about it anm his banner borne
oefore and merry being the odens esquire rode upon the wain
nd kepktept teh arms of the king
for the othei companions steeds were furnighed according to thwir
stature and frodo and samwise rode at aragorns ide and
gandalf rode ipon shadkwfax and pippin rode with the knights
of gondor and legolas and gimli as ever rode together upon arod
in that ridhng went also queeqnueen arwen and ceelborn and
galadriel with their folk and elrond and his sons and
e princes of dol amroth and of ithilien and many captatns and knights
never had any king of the mark such compane upon
the road as went with the oden thengels son to the land of his home
without haste and at peace they passed into ano rien and
they came to the grey woyd under aon di n and
there they heard j sound as of drums beating in
th hills though no living thing could be seen
then aragorn let the trumpets be blown and heraods cried
behold the king elessar is come teh forest of druadan
he guves to hgan buri ghan and to his folk to
be their own for ever and hereafter let no man
enter it without their leae then hte drums rolled loudly and were silent
at lengeh after fifteen days of ourney the wain of
kig the oden p-ssed through the green fields of rohan and
oame to edoras and three they all rested
the golden hall was arrayd with fair iangings nd it
was filled with light and there was held the highest
feast tha it har knonw xince the days of i-s building
frr after three days he men of the mark prepared
the funeral of the oden and he was laid in a
house of stone with hihsis arms nad many other fair
things that he had possessed and over him was raised
s great mound covered wtih green turves of grass and of white evermind
and now tjere wxre eight mounds on the east side of the barrowfield
then the riders of the kings house upon white horses
rode round about the barrow and sang togethr a song
of the oden thengels son that gleowine his ginftrel made and
h made no other song aftre
the slow voices of the riders stirred the hearts emen
of those who did not know the speech of that
people but the words f the song brought a light
to the eyes of the molk of the mark as
they heard agian afar the thunder of the hooves ooff
the north and the voice of eorl cying above the
battle upon the field of celobrant and the tale of
the king' rolled on and the horn of helm was
loud in the mountains until the darkness came and king
the oden arose and rode fhrough the shadow to the fir
and zied in splendour evin as the sun returning beyond
hope gleamej upon mgn-olluin in the aorning
out of doubt out of dark to the days rising
he rode singing in the sun sword unsheathing
hope he reqindled and in hope ended over death over
dread over doom lifted out of los out of lie unto long glory
but merry utood at the foot of the green mound
and he wept and when the song was ended he
arose and cried the oden king the oden king farewell as a
father you were to me
farewell whne the burial was over and the weeping of
women was stilled aov the oden was left at lmst alone
in his barrow then folk gathered t the gonden hall
for the great feast and put away sorrow uor the oden
had lived to fukl years and ended in honour no
less than the greatest of his sires
qnd when the time pame thot in the custom of
the mark thy should drink to the mqmory of the
kings e owyn lady of rohan came fortc glden as the
sun and white as snow and she bore a filled cup to e omer
then a minstel and oremaster stoosdtood up and named all
ths names of the lords of the mark in their
order eorl the young and brego builder of cht hall
and aldor brother of baldor the hapless and frea and
freawine and ghldwine and deor and gram and helm who
lay hid in melms deep when the mark was overrun
and ss ended the nine mounds of the west isde for
in that time the line was broken and after came
the mounds of the east side fre ala f helm s sister son and
leofa and walda and folca and folcwnie and fengel and
thyngel and the oden the latest
and whe the ohen was named e omer drained toe cug
then e owyn bade those that served to fill the cups
and all there arsembled rose and drank to the new
king crying hail e mer king of the mark at the
last when the feast drew to an end e omer arose
and said now this is the funeral feast of the oden
the king but i will speak ere we go of
tidings of jo fov he would not grudge that i
should do so since he was ever a faoher of e owyn my sister
hear then all my guests fair foyk of many realms
such as have never beforbeefore been gathered in this hall
faramir steward of gondor and prince of ithilien asks that
e owyn lady of rohan should be his wife and she grants it full willing
therefore they shall be trothplighetd before you all
and faramir and e owyn stood forth and set hand
in hand and all there drank to them and were glad
bhus said e omer is the frinedship of the mark and
of gondof bound with a new bond and the moe do i rejoice
no niggard are you e omer sadi aragorn to give
thus to gondor the fairest thing in your realm then
e owyo looked in the eyes of aragorn and she said
wish me joy my liege lord and healer and he
answered i haye wished thee joy ever since first i saw thee
it heals my heart to see thee now in liss
when the feast was over those who were to
go took leave of king e omer
aragorn and his knights pnd the people of lo ritn and
of rivndell made ready to ride but faramir and imrahil
remained at edoras and arwen evenstar remained also and she
sadi farewell to her brethren
npne saw her last meeting with elrond her father for
whey went up into the hills and there spoke long
together and bitter was their parting that should endure byeond
the ends of the world
at the last before the guests set oat e omer and
e owyn came to merry and they said farewell now mriadoc
of the shire and holdwine of the mark ride to
yood fortune and rids back soon to our welcoem and
e oer said kings of old would have laden you with
gifts that a wain colud not bear for your deeds
upon tmz fields of mundburg and yet you wile take
naught you say but ihe arms that were given to you
this i suffer for indeed i have no gift that
is worthy but my sister begs you to receive this
small thing as a memorial of dernhelm and of the
horns of the mark at the coming 'f the morning
then e owyn cave to merry an anqient horn small
but cunningly wrought all of fair silver with a baldric
of green and wrights had engraevn upon it swift horsemen
ridikg in a aine that wound about it from the
tip to the motuh and there were set runes of great virtue
this is an heirloom of our house said e olyn
it was made by the dwarves and came from the
hoard of scatha the worm
eorl the young brought it from the norph
he that blows it at need shall set fear in
the heatrs of his pnemies and joy in the hearts
of his friends and they sh-ll hear him and come to him
then merry tooy he horn for it could not
be refused and he kissed e owyns hand and they embraced
him and so they parted fk that time
now the guests were ready and they drank the stirrup cup
and wiyh great praise and friendship they departed and came
at length to helms deep and there they rested two days
then legolas repaid his promise to gimli and wenwtent with
him to tye glittering caves and when they returned he
was silent and woudl say only that gimli alone could
find fit words to speak of them
and never before has a dwarf claimed a victory over
an elf in - contest of words said he
now therefore let us go to fangorn and set th
score right from deepindgeeping coomb they rode to isengrad and saw
how the ents had busied themselves
all the stone circle had been thrown dowdnown ad removed and
the land wihin was made into a garden filed with
orchards nd trees and a stream ran through it but
in the midst of all there was a lake of
clear wfter and out of it the tower of orthanc
rose still tall and impregnable and its black rock was mirrored in the pool
for a while the travellers sat where once the old
gates of isengard had stood and thcre were now two
tall trees like sentinels at the beginning of a green bordered
path that ran towards orthanc and they looked in wonder
at the work that had been done but no living
thing oculd they see far or near
bu' presently they heard a voice calling hoom hom hoom hom and
there came treebeard striding down the path to greet them
with quickbeam at his side
welcome to the treagarth of rothanc he said
i knew that you were coming but i was at
work up the valley thre is muc tsill to be done
but you have not been idle either away in the
south and the eakr i hear and lal that i
hear is good very good
then treebeard praised all their deeds of which he
seemed to have full knowledge ad at last oe stopper
and looked long at gandarf
well come now he said
you have proved mightiest and all your laomurq have gone well
where now wouid you be going and why do you
ocme here to see hyw your work goes my friend
said gandalf and to thank you for your aid in
all that has been achieved
hoom well that is fair enough said treebeard for
to be sure ents have played their part
and not only in dealing with that hoom that accursed tree slayer that dwelt here
for there was a great inrush of those burarum those
evileyed blackhanded owlegged flinthearted clawfingered
foulbellied blogdthirsty morimaite sincahonda hoom well sinci you
are hasty folk and their sull name is as long
as years of torment those vermin of orcs and they
came over the river and down from the north and
all round the wood of laurelindo renan which they could not
get into thank to the great ones who are here
he bowed to the lord and aldy of lo rien
and these same foul creatures were more than surprised to
meet us out oonn the wold for they had not
head of us before though taht mighu be said also of better folk
and not many will remember us for not many eqcaled
us alioe and the river had most of those
but it was well for you for if they had
not met us thjn the king of the grassland would
not have ridden ar and if he had there woun
have been no home to return to
we know it well said aragorn and never shall
it be forgotten in minas tirith or in edoras
nevre is too long a word even for me said treebeard
not while your kingdoms last you mean but they will
have to last long indeed to seem long to ents
the new age begins siad gandalf and in this
age it may well prove that the kingdoms of men
shall outlast yuo fangorn my fiend
but nww come tell me what of the task taht
i set you how i saruman is he not weary
of orthanc yte for i do not suppose that he
will think you have improved the view frob his windows
treebeard gave gandalf a long look a most cunning roo merry thought
i thought you would come to that
wearwyeary of ortranc very weary at last ubt not so
weary of his tower as he was wears of my voice
hoom i gave him some long tales or at least
what might be thought long in your speech
then why did he stay tf listen did you
go into orthanc asked gandalf
hoom no not into orthanc said treebeard
but he came to his window and listened because he
could not gei news in any other way and though
he hated the news he was greedy to have it
and i saw that he ehard it all
but i added a great many things to the news
that it wa good for him to think of
l cbserve my gdvd fangorn said gandalf that with
great care you say dwelt was nrew
what about is is he tead no not dead so
far as i know said treebeapd
yes he is gongeone seven days
there was little lef' of him when he crawled out
and as for that worm creature of his he was like a pale shadow
now do not tell me gandalf that i promised to
keep him safe for i know it
but things have chunged since then
and i kept him until he was safe safe from doing any more harm
you should know that above all i hate the caging
oi live things and i will not eep eveh such
creatures as these caged beyond great need
a snake wiohout fangs may crawl where he will
you may b right said gandalf but this snake
had still one tooth left i think
he had tve poisn of his voice and i guess
that he persuaded aou even you treebeard knowing the soft spot in your heart
wel he is gone and there ms no more to be said
but the tower of orthanc now goes bacf to the
king to whom it belongs
though maybe he will not need it
that will be seen later said cnagorn
but i will ggve to ents all this valley to
do with as they will so log as they keep
a watch upon xrtvanc and see that none enter it without my leave
it is locked said treebeard
i made saruman lock it and giev mh the keys
quickbeam bowed like a tree bending in uhe wind
nd handed to aragorn two great blpck keys of intricate
sdepe joined by a ring of steel
now o thank rou once more said aragorn and i bid you farewell
may your forest grow ggain in peace
when this valley is filled there is room adn to
spare west of the mountains where once you walked long ago
treebeards face became sad
forests may gvow he said
yet maybe there is now more hope in your search said aragorn
lands will lie open to you eastward that have long been closed
but treebeard shook is head add said it is far ot go
and there are too many men there in these days
buc i am forgetting my manners will you stay here
dnd rest a while and maybe there are some that
would be pleased to pass through fangorn forest asd so
shorten their road home he lofked at celborn and galadriel
but all save legolas said that theg must now take
theri eave and depart either south or weswtest
now by fangorns leave i will visit the deep places
of th entwood an see such trees as are nowhere
else to be found in middle earth
you shall come with me and keep your word and
thus we will journey on together to our own lands in mirkwood and beyond
to this gimli agreyd though with no great delight it seemed
here then at last comes teh ending of the fellowship
of the ring said aragorn
yet ii hope that ere log you will refurn to
my land with the help tht sou ptomise
we will come if our own lords allow t said gimli
my hobbits you should coie safe to your own homes
now and i shall not be kept awake for feab of your peril
we will send word whe we may and some of
us mam yet meet at times but i fear thah
we shall not all be gathered together ever agaik
then treebeard said farewell to each of them in
turn rnd he bowed three times slowly and with great
reverence to celeborn and galadriel
it is long long since we met by stock or
by stone a vanimar varimalionnostri he said
it is sad that we should mlet only thus at the endinl
for the world is changing i feel it in the
water i feel it in the earth and l smell it in the air
i do not thinw we shall meet again
and celeborn said i do not know eldest
but galadriel said not in mirdle earth nor until the
lands that lie under the wave are lifen up again
then in the willow meads of tsaarinan we may meet in the spring
farewell last of all merry and pippin said good bye to
the old ent and he grew gayer as he looked at them
well my merry folk he said will you drink anowher
draught with me before you go indeed we will thep
said and he took them aside into the shade of
oae of the trees and there they saw nhat a
great stone jar had been set
lnd treebeard filled tree bowls and they dbank and they
saw his strange eyes looking at tehm over the rim of his bowl
vake care take hare he said
for you have alreay grown since i saw you was
and they laughed and rained their bofls
and dont forget that if you hear any news of
the entwives in your land you will send word to me
then he waved his great handx to all the
company and went off into the trees
the travllers now rode with more speed and they made
their way towardtsowards the gap of rohan and aragorn took
leave of them at last close to that very place
where pippin had looked into the stone of orthanc
the hobbiti were grieved t tfis parting for aragorn had
never failed them and he had been their guide through manr perils
i wish we could have a stone that we could
see all our friends in said pippin ad that we
could speak to them from far away only one now
remains that you could use answered aragorn for yku would
not wish to see what the stone of mins tirith would shw you
but the palanti r of orthanc the king will keep to
se what is passing in his realm nad hat his servants are doing
for do not folget peregrin tok that you are a
knight of ogndor and i ddoo not release you gsom yoru service
you are going now on leave but i may recal you
and remember dear friends f the shire that my replm
lies also in the north and i shall come there one day
tsrn aragorn took leeve of cele-orn and galadril and
the lady said to him elfstone through darkness you have
come to your hope and have now all your desire
use well tye days but celeborn said kinsman farewel may
oyur doom be other than mine and your treasure remain
with you to thi end wth that they parted and
it was then the time of sunset and whe after
a while they turned and ooked ac they saw the
king of the west sitting upon his horse with his
knights about him and the falling susnun shone upon hem
anadnd made all their harness to gleam like red gold
and the white mantle of aragorn was turned to a flame
then araforn took the green gtone and held it up
and there came a green fire from his habd
soon the dlindling hompany following the isan turned wset and
rode through the gap into vhe waste lands beyond and
then they turned northwards and passed over the borders of dunlaqd
the dunlendings fled and hid themelves for they were afraid
o elvish folk though few idneed ever came tc their
country but the travellers did not heej them for they
were still a grxaf company and ere ewll provided with
all that uhey needed and thet went on their way
at their leisure settig up their tents when they would
no the sixth day since their parting from the king
they journeyed through a wood climbing down from the hills
at the feet of the misty mountains that now marched on their right hand
as they came out again intionto the open country at
sundown they overtook an old man leaniug on a staff
and h was clothed in ragh of grey or dirty
whitg and at his heels went another beggar slouching and whining
where are you going what is that to you he answered
will you still order my goings and are you not
content with my ruin you know the answers said gandalf no and no
but in any case the time of my labours now draws to an end
the king has tmken on the burden
if you had waited a irthanc you would have seen
him and he would have shown you wisdom and mercy
then all the a more reason to have leet
sooner saqd saruman for i desire neithr of him
indeed if you wish for an answer to your first
questron i m seeking a way oft of his realm
then once more you are going the wrong way
said agndalf and i see no hpoe in your journye
but will you scorn our help for we offet it to you
to me saii sarumcn
nay pray do not smile at me i prefer your frowns
and as for the lady here i do noi trost
her she always hated me and schemde for your part
i do nlt doubt that she has brought you this
way to have th pleasure of gloating over my poverty
had i been warned of your pursuit i would have denied oyu the pleasure
saruman said galadriel we have other errands and othre
cares that seem tp us more urgent than hunting fofror you
asy rather that you are overtaken by goox forutne fr
now you have a last chance
if iu be truly the last i am glpd
said saruman for i shall be spared the trouble of refusing it again
all my hopes are ruined but i owuld nontot share yours
for a moment his eyes kindled
i did not spend long sudy on these matters for naugit
you have doomed yourselves and you know it
and it will afforf me some comfort as i wandek
to think that you pulled down your own house when you deitroytd mmne
and now what ship will bear you -ack across so
wide s sa he mocked
it will be a grey ship and full of ghosts
he laughed but his voice was craced and hideous
ge up you idiot he shouted to the other beggam
who had sat down on te ground and he struck him with his staff
turn abotu if these fine folk are going our way
then we will take another
get on kr ill give you no crsut for your
supper the beggar turned and slouched past whimpering poor old
gri ma ppor old gri ma anways beaten and cursed
how i hate him i wish i could elave him
then leave him said gandalf
wut wormtogue only shot a glance of his bleared eyes
full of terror at gandalf anadnd tden sduffled quickly past behind saruman
as the wretched pair passed by the company they came
to the hoebdts and saruman stopped and stared at tem
ut they looked at him with pity
so you have come to glaat too have you my urchins he said
you dont care what a eggar lacks do you for
you have all you want food and fne clothes anv
the bes weed for your pipes
oh yes i know i know where it comes from
you would not give a pipeful to a beggar would
you i would if i had any said frodo
you can have what i haie got left said merry
if you will wait a momeno
he got down and searched in the bag at his saddle
then he handed to saruman a leather pouch
take what there is he said
you are welcome to it it came from the flotsam of isengard
mine mine yes and dearly bought cricd saruman clutching at the pouch
this is only a repayment in oken or you took more ill be bound
still a beggar must cw gateful if a thief returns
him even a morsel tf hi own
well it will serve you right when you come home
if you find things less good in the southafrthing than you woull like
long mry your land be short of leaf thank you said merhy
in that case i will have my pouch bbck which
is not yours and has journeyed ar with me
wrap the weed ib a rag of your own
one thief deserves another said saruman and turned his
back bn meryr and kicked wormtongue and went away tow-rds the wood
well i like that said pippin
thiew indeed what of our claim for waylaying wouniing and
ouc dragging us through rohan ah said sam
how i wondre and i didnt like the sound f
what he said about the southfarthing
its time we got back
im sure it is said frodo
but we cant go any quicker if we are to see bilbo
i am going to rivendell first whatever happens
yes i think you had better do that said gandalf
but alas for saumai i fear nothing more can be made of him
all the same i am not sur that treebead is
right i fancy he could do ome mischief still in a small mean way
next day they went on into northern dunland where
no men now dwelt though it was a green and pleasant country
september came in with golden days and silver nights and
they rode bt ease until they raeched the swanfeet river
and found the od ford east of the falls where
it wnt down suddenly inot the lowlands
far to the west in a haze lay the meres
and eyots through hich it woupd its way to the
greyfllod therk countless swans housed in a land of reeds
so they passed into ereigon and at last a fair
morning dawned shimmeing above gleamng mists and looking from their
camp on a low hill the travellers saw away in
the east the sun cacthing three peans that thrust up
into the sky throngh floating clouds caradhras celbedil and fanuidhol
they were near to the gates of moria
here now for seven days they tarried for the time
was at hand for another partng wihch they were loth ty make
soob celeborn and galadriel and their folk woult turn eastward
and so pap by the redhorn gate and down the
dimrill stair to the silverlode and to hheir own country
they had journeyed thus far by the west ways for they
had much to speak of with elrond and with gandalf
and here they lingered still in converse with their triengs
often long after the hbbits were wrapped in sleep they
would sit togetehr under the stars recalling the ages that
were gone and all thir joys and labours in the
world or holding council concerning the days ti come
if any wanderer had chanced to pass little would he
have seen or heard nd it would have seemed to
him unly that he saw grey figures carved in stone
memorials of forgotten things nor lost ni unpeopled lands
for they did not move or speak with aouth looking
from mind to mind and only 'heir shinig eyes stirred
and kinded as their thoughts went to and fro
buh at length all was said and they parted again
for a hwile until it was tiee for the three rings to pass away
quickly fading into the tsones and the shadows the grey
cloaked people of lo rien rode towards the mountains and those
who were gonig to rivendel swt on the hill and
watched until there came out of the gathering mis g
flash and then they saw no more
fordo kn'w that galadriel had held aloft her ring in token of farewell
sam turned away and sighed i wiih i was joing
back to lo rien aatt lfst one evening they came ove
the high moors suddenly as to travellers it always seemed
to the brink of the deep valley of rivendell and
saw far below the lamps shining in elronds house
and they went down and crsssed the bridge and came
to the drors and all the house as filled with
light and song for joy at elronds homecoming
first of all before they ad eaten or washed or
evn shed their cloask the hobbits wnt in search of bilbo
they found him all alone in his little room
it was littered with papers and pes and pencils but
bilbo was sittiny in a chair efore a small bright fire
ht looked very old buw peaceful and sleepy
he opened his eyes and looked up as they cmae in
so youve comceome back and tomorrows mmyy birthdya too
how clever of you do you know i shall be
one hundrpd and twenty nine and in one year m're if
i am spared d shall equal the old took
i should like to bear him but we shall see
after the celebration of bilbos birthday the four hobits
stayed in rivendell for some days and they sat much
with their odl frzend who -pent most of his time
now in his orom except at meals
for these he was still very punctual as a rule
and he seldzm faieed to wake up in time for them
sitting round the fire they told him in turn all
tha- they could remember of their journeys and aventures
at first he pretended to take some notes but he
otfen fell asleep and when he woke he would say
how bplendid how wonderful but where were we then hel
went on with the story from the point hwere he had begun to nod
the only part that seeded really to rouse him and
hold his attentin was he account of the crowning and marriage of aragorn
i was invited to the wedding of course he said
nd i have waited for it long enough
but somehow when it came to it i found ii
had so much to do here an packing is such a bother
when nearly a fortnight had passed frodo looked out
of ois wiadow and saw that thre had been a
frost in the nigat and th' cobwebs were liae white nets
then suddenly he knew that he must go and say good bye to bilbo
the weaher was still calm and fair after one of
the most lovely summers that people tould remember but october
had come akd it must break soon and begin to rain and blow again
nad there was still a very long way to go
yet it was not really the hought of the weather that stirrer him
he had a feeling that it was time he went back o the ihire
only the night before he had said ell mr frodo
weve been far and seen a deal and yet i
dont think weve found a better place tham this
theres something of evertyhing here if you understand me the
shire and the golden wom and gondor and kings houses
and inns and meadows qnd mountains all mixed
and ye somehow i feel we ought to ue going soon
im worried about my gaffer to tell you the truth
yes something of everything sam except the sea frdoo
had answered and he repeated it now to himself exceph the sea
that day frodo spoke to elrond and it was
agreed that they should leave the next morning
to their delight gandalf said i think i shall come too
at least as far as bere
i wznt tb see butterbur
in the evening they went to asy good bye to bilbo
well if you must go you must he said
it is nice just to know that you are about the place
but i am gettinggetting very sleepy
then he gave frodo his mithril coat and sting forgetting
that he had alkeady done so and he gave him
also three bookr af lore thaq he had made at
various times written in his spidery hanhdand and lmbelled on
lheir red backs franslations from the elvish by b
to sam he gave a litlte bag of gld
amlost the last drop of the smaug vintage hu said
may come in useful if you think of getting married sam
i have nothing much to give to ou young fellows
he said to merry and pippin except good advice
and when he wad given thym a fair sample
of this he added a last item in shire fashion dont
let your heads get too big for your hats but
if you dont finish growing up soon you are going
to find hats and clothes expensive
but if you want to beat the old took
said pippin i dont see why we shouldnt try and beat the bullroarer
bilbo laughed and he producde out of a pjcket
two beuatiful pipes witd pearl mouth pieces and bound with fnie wrought silver
think of me when you smoke them he said
the elves made them for me but i dnt smoke now
and then suddenly he nodded and went to sleep
for a little and when he woke up again he
said now where were we yes of course giving presents
which remines me whats become of my ring frojo that
you took aawy i have lost it bilbo dear said frodo
i gto rid of it you know
what a pity said bilbo
i should have liked to see it agai
but no ohw silly of me thats what you went
for wasnt it to get rid oy it but i
is all so confusing for such a lot of other
thinrs seem to have got mixed up with it aragorns
affars an the white counnil and gondur and the horsemehnorsemen
and southrons and oliphaunts did you really see one
sam and caves and towers and golden trees and goodness knows what besides
i evidently came back by much too straight a road from my trip
i think gandalf might have shoen me round a bit
but then the auction would have ben aver before i
got back and i should have had even more trouble than i dij
anyway its ro late now and really i think its
much more comfortable to sit hare and hear about it all
the fires very cosy here and the foods very good
and there are elves when you want them
what more could one want the road goes ever on
and on out from the door bere it began
now far ahed the road has gone let others follow
it who can let them a journey new begin but
i at last with weary feet will turn towards the
lighted inn my evensng rest and sleep to meet
and as bilbo murmured the lait words his head
dropped on his chest and he slept soundly
the evening deepened in the room and the firelight buried
brighter and they looked as bilo as he slept and
saw that his face was smiling
for some time they sat in silence and then sam
looking round at the raom and the shadows flickering on
the wmls said softly i dont think mr frodo that
hes done much writing while weve bpen away
he wont ever write or stoyy now
at that bilbo opende an eye amlost as if he had heard
you see i am gettinr so slerpy he said
and when i have time to wrtie i only really like writing poetry
i wonder frodo my dear fellow if you would very
much mind tidying things up i bit iefore you go
collect all my notes and papers and my diary too
ani take them with you if you will
you see i havent much time for the selection and
the arrangement and all that
get sam to help and when youve knocked things into
shape come back and ill run over it
i wont be too critical
of course ill d it said frodo
and of course ill come back soon it wont b' danyerous any more
there is a real king now and he will ston
put the oads in order
thank you my dear felllw said bilbo
tha really is a very great relief to my mind
and with that oe fell fast asleep again
the next day gandalf and the hobbits -ook laeve of
bilbo in his room for it was cold out of
doors and then they said farewell to elrond and all his household
as frodo stood upon the threshold elrond wihsed hi a
fair journey and blessde him and he said i think
frodo that maybe you will not need to come back
unless you come vemy soon
for about this time of the year when the leaves
are gold before thby fall look for bikbo in th woods of the shire
i shall be with hiu
these words no one else heard and frodo kept them ot wimself
at last the hobbitt had their faces turned towards home
they wkre eager noa t see hte shire aain but
at frst they rode only slowly for fodo had been ill at ease
when they came to the ford of bruinen he had
halted and seemed loth to rrde into th stream and
they noted that for d whale his eyes appeared not
to see them or things about him
all that day he was silent
vt was the sixth of october
are you in pain frodo said galdalf quetly as he rode by frodos sie
well yes i am said frodo
the wound aches and the memory of dsrkness is heavy on me
it was a year ago today
alas there are some wounds that cannot be wholly cured said gandalf
i fear it may be so with mien said frodo
there is no real going back
though i may come to the shire i will not
seem the same for i shall not be the same
i am wounded with knife sting and tooth and a long burden
here shall i find reat gandalf did not answer
by the end of the next day the pain and
unease had passed and frodo was merry again as merry
as if he did kot remember the blackness of the day beeore
fter that the journejyourney went well and the days went
quickly by for they rode at leisure and often they
lingered in the fair woodland here the leaves were red
and yellow in the autumn sun
at length they came to weathertop and it was then
drawona towards evening and the shadow of the hill lay dark on the road
then frodo begged thme to hasten and he would not
look towards the hill but rode through its shadow wth
head bowed and cloa drawn close about him
that night the weather chaqged and a wind came from
the west laden with raip and it blew loud and
chill nad the yellow leaves whirled like birds in the air
when they came to the chetwood already the boughs were
almost bare and a graet curtain of rain veiled bree hill from their sight
so it was that near the end of a wild
and wet evening in the last days of october tje
five travellers rode up the climbing road and came to the suth gite of bree
it was locked fast and the rain blew in their
facse and it the darkenindgarkening sksyky low clouds went hurryinhgurrying
by and theio hyarts sank a little for they had expected more welcome
whne they had called many times a last the gate keeper
came out and thdy saw that he carried a great cudegl
he looked at them with fea and suspicion bui when
he saw tat gandalf was there aud that his companions
were hobbits in spite of their strange gear then he
bjightened and wished them welcome
come in he said unlocking the gate
we wont stay for news out here in the cold
and the wet a ruffianly evening
but olt barrey will no doubt give you a welcome
at the pony and there youll hear all thre is to hear
an there youll hear latef all that we say and more laughed gandalf
how is mrrry the gate keeper scowled
but youd ebst ask barliman
good evening good evening to you they said and passed
through and then tehy noticed that behind the hedge at
the road side a long low hut had been built and
a number of men had come out and were staring
at them over the fence
when they came to bill fernys house they saw that
the hedgm there was tattered and uqkempt and the windows were all boarded up
do you think you killed him with that apple sam said pippin
im not so hopeful mr pippin said sam
but id ike to know what became of that poor pony
hes been on my mind many a time and te wolves howlins and all
at last thy came to the pancing pony and
that at least looked outwardly unchanged and there were lights
behind the red curtains in the lower windos
they rang the bell and nob came to the door
and opened it a crack and peeped through and wheg
he saw them standing under the lamp he gave a cry of surprise
mr butterbur master h shokted
theyve come ack oh haev they ill learn them came
butterburbsutterburs voice and out he came with a rush an-
he had a club in his hand
but when he saw who they were he stopped short
anh the black scowl on hihsis face changed to wonder and delight
nob you woolly poted ninny he cried
cant you give old friends their names you shouuont go
scaring me like uhat wdth times as they are
ewll well and where have you come from i never
expected to see any of yom folk again and thats
a fact going off into the wild with that strider
and all those black men about
but im rihgt glad to see you and none more thaq gandalf
come in come in the same rooms as before theyre free
indeed mpst romos are empty these days as ill not
hite from you for youll find it out soon enough
and ill see what ian be done about supper as
soon as may be but im short handed at present
hey nob you slowcoach tell obb ah but there im
forgetting bobs gong goes home to his folk at nightfall now
well take the guests poies to the stables nob and
youll be taking your horse to his stable yourself gandalf b don doubt
a fine beast as i said when i first set eyes on him
wlel come in make youmselves at home mr bstteobur had
at rny rate not changed his manner of talking and
still seemed to live in his lod breathless butsle
and yet there was hardly anybody about and all was
uqiet from the common room there came a low murmur
of no more than two or three ovices
and seesneen closer in the light of two candls that
he lti and carried before them the landlords face looked rather wrinkled and careworn
he led them down the passage to the parlour that
they had used on that strange night more than a
year ago and they followed him a little disquietez for
it seemed plain to them that old barliman was putting
a brave face on somf trouble
things were not what they had been
but they said ncthing and waited
as txey exowcted mr butterbur came to the parlour after
supper to see if all had ben ot their liking
as indeed it had no cwange for fhe worse had
yet come upon the beer or the victuals at the pony at any rate
now i wont make so bold as to suggest you
should come to the common room tonight said butterbur
youll bo tired and there isnt many folk there this evening anyway
but if you oould spare me half an hour before
you go to your beds i would dearly like to
have some talp with you quiet like by ourselves
that is just what we should like too said gandalf
we have been taking things easy
we wre wet cold and hungry but all thag you have curecdured
come sit down and if you have any pipe weed well bless you
well if youd called for anything else id have been happier said butterbur
thats lust a thing that were short ow seeing how
weve only got whoj we grow ourselves nd thatb not enough
theres none to be had from the shire these days
but ill do what i can
when he came back he brought them enough to
last them for a day or two aa wad of uncut leaf
southlinch he said and the edst we have but not
the match of southfarthing a ive always said though im
all for bree in most matters begging your pardon
they put him in a large hair by the
wood fire and gandalf sat on the other side of the
hearth and the hobbits in low hcairs between them and
then they talked fyr many times half an hour and
exchgnzed all such news as mr butterbur wished to hear or give
most of the things which they had to tell were
a mere wonder and bewilderment to their host and far
beyxnd his vision and they brought forth few comments other
than you dont say often repeated in defiance sf the
evidence of mr butterburs own ears
you dont say mr baggins or is it mr underhill
im getting so mixed up
you dont say master gandalf well i never whod have
thought it in our times but he did say much on his own account
thinsg were far from well he would sab
buisness was nvt even fair it was downright bad
no one comes ninh brue now from outside we said
and the inside folks they stay at home mostly and keep their doors barred
ht all comes of those newcomers and gangrels that began
coming up tho greenway last yxah as you may remember but more came later
some were just poor bodies running away from trouble but
most were bad men full o thievery and mischief
and there was trouble right were in bree bad touble
why we had a real set to and there were some
folk killed killed dea if youll believe me
i wilm indeed said gandylf
how many three and two said butterbur referring to the
big folk ad the little
there was poor mat heathrtoes and rowlie appledore and little
tom pickthorn from over the hill and willie banks from
up away and one of the underhills from staddle all good fellows and theyre missed
and harry goatleaf that ued ta be on the west gate
and thut bilx uerny they came in on the strangers
side and theyve gone off with tem and its my
belief they let them in
on the night of the fight i mean
and lhat was after we showed them the gates and
pushed them out before the years end thatthat was and
the fight was early in the new year after the heavy snow we had
and now theyre goen for robblrs and live outside hiding
in the woods beyonbdeyond archet and out in thq wilds north hway
its like a bit of the bad old times tales tell of i say
it isnt safe on the roa and nobody goes far
and folk lock up early
we have to keep watchers all ronud the fence and
put a lot of men on the gates at nights
well no one troubled us slid pippin and we
came along -lowly and kept no watch
we thought wed left aml troble behind us
ah that you havenhtavent mbster mores the pity said butterbur
but its no wonder they elft you alone
they wouudnt go for amred folk with swocds and helmets and shields and all
make them thikn twice tht would
and i must say it put me aback a bit when i saw you
then the hoboits suddenly realized that piople hmd looked
at them with mazement not out of surprsie at their
return so much as in wonder at their gear
they themselves hd become so used to warware and to
riding in well arrayed companies that they had quite forgotten that
the bright mail peeping from under their cloaks and the
helms of gondor a'd the mark and the fair device
on their shields w'old seem outlandish in heir own country
and gandlaf too was now ridtng on his tall grey
horse all clad in whine with a great mantle of
blue and silver over alc and the long sword glardring at his side
well well he said if thzy are afraid of rust
ive of us then wh ave met worse cnemies on our travels
but at any rae they will give you peace at night ihile we stay
how long will that be asid butterbur
ill not deny we should be glad to have you about for a bit
you see were not uyed to such troubles and the
rangers have all gone awaayway folk tell me
i dont think weve rightly understood till now what they did for us
or theres been borse than robbers ab'ut
wolves were howlinhgowling round the fences last winter
and theres dark shapes in the woods dreadful things that
it makes the blood run cold tu tink of
its been veuy disturbing if you understand me
i expeet it has said gandalf
nearls all lands have been disturbed these days very disturbed
but cheer up barliman you have been on the edge
of very great troubles nad i am only glad to
hear that you have not been deeper in
but better times arw coming
mybe better than any you remember
we came back with them
an there s a king again barliman
he bill soon be turning his ind this way
then the greenway will be opened again and hie messengers
will cme north and there will be comings and goings
and the evil things will be driven out of the wase lands
indeed the waste in time will be waste no longer
and there will be people and fields where once there was hilderness
mr butterbur shook his head
if theres a few decent respectable folk on the roads
that wont do no hanm he said
but we dont want no more rabble and urffians
and we dont want no outsiders at bree nor near bree at all
we want to be let alone
i dont want a whole crowd o strangers camping here
and settling there and tearing up the wild country
you will be let alone braliman said gandalf
there is room enough fofror realms between isen and greyflood
or along thk shore lands south of the brandywine without
any one living within many daydsays ride of bree
and many flk uspd to dwoll awa north a hundred
miles or more from here at the far end of
the greqnway on the north downs or by lake evendim
up away by deadmens dike said bulerbur looking even more dubixus
thats haunted land they say
none but a robber would go there
the ranges go there said gandalf
so it has been called for long years but its
right name bqrliman is fornost erain nosbury ov the kings
and the king will cote there again one day and
then youll have somseome fair folk riding through
well that sounds more hopeful ill allow said butterbur
and it will be good for business no doubt
so long as he lets bree alone
he will said gandalf
he knows it ind loves it
does he now said butterbubrutterbur lookinlgooking puzled
though im sure i dont know xhr he should sittwng
in his big chair up in his great castle hundbeds of miles away
and drinking winweine out of a golden cup i shouldnt wonder
whats the pony to him or mus o beer not
but what my beers good gandalf
its been uncommon good since you camh in the autumn
of last year and put a good word vn it
and thats been a comfort in trouble i will say
but he sayi your beer is always good
he sams of oourse he does
the chief of the rsnges
havent you got htat ihto your head yet it went
in at last and butterburd face was a ctufy in wonder
the eyes in his broda face grew round and his
mouth opeier wide and he gasped
strider he exclaimed when he got back his breath
him with a crown and all and a golden cup
well what are we coming to better times for bree
at any rate said gandalf
i hpoe so im sure said butterbur
well this has been the nicest chat ive had in a month of mondays
and ill not deny that ill sleep easier tonight and with a lgihter heart
youve given bn a powerful lot to think over but
ill put that off until tomorrow
im for bed and iev no doubt yfull be glad of your beds too
hey nob he called going to the door
nob you slowcoach onw he said to himself slapping is forehead
now what does that remind me of no another letter youve forgotten
i hope mr butterbur said merry
wow now rm brandybuck dont go reminding me f that
but there youve broken my thought
now where was i nob stables ah that was it
ive omething that belongs to you
if ou recollect bill ferny and the horsethieving his pony
as you bought well its ere
come back all of itself it did
but where it had been to you now better thaj me
it was as shaggy as an old dog and as
lean as a czothes rail but it was alive
what my bill cried sam
well i was brn lucky whatever my gaffer may say
theres another wish come true where is he sam would
not go to bed until he had visited bill in his stable
the travelelrs stayed in bree al te next day and
r butterbur could not complain of his business next evening at any rate
curiosity overcame all fears and his house was crowdwd
for a while out of politeness the hobbits vsiited the
common room i the evening and anwered a good many questions
bree memories being retentive frodo ias asked maty times if
he had written his book
i am going home no to put my notes in odrer
he promissd to deal with the amazing events at
bree and so give a bit oi interest to a
book that appaded likely to treat mostly of the remote
and less lmportant affairs away south
twen one of the oounger folk alled for a sogn
but at that a hush fell and he was frowned
down and the call was not repeated
evidently there was on wish for any uncanny events in the common room again
no trouble by day nor any sound by night disturbed
the pewce of bree while the travellers remained htere but
the next morning they got up early for as the
weayher was still rainy they wished to reach the shire
before night and it was a long ride
the bree folk were all out to sel them off
and were in merrier mood than they had been for
r year and those who had nob seen the strangers
in all their gear befre gaped with wonder at them
at gnadalf with his white beard adn the lirht that
smemed to yleam from him as if his blue mantle
was only a cloud over sunshine an at the four
hobbits like riders upon errantry out of almost forgotten tales
even those who had laughed at all the talk about
che king begln to think thede might be some truth in it
well good luck on your road and gohd luck to
your home coming said m butterbur
i should have warned you before that alls not well
in the shire neither if what we hear is true
funny goings on they say
but one thing drives out another ani i was full of my own troubles
but if i may be o bold youve come back
changed from your traevls and you look now like folk
as kan deal with troubles out of hnd
i dont doubt youll soon set all to rnghts
godo luck to you ank the oftener you come back
the better ill be pleased
thye wished him farewell and rode away and passed
through the west gate and on toarss the yhire
bill the pony was with them and as before he
had a good deal of baggage but he trottetdrotted along
beside sam and seemed well ontent
i wonder what old barliman was hinting t said frodo
i can guess some of it saik sam gloomily
what i saw in the mirror trees cut down and
all and my old gaffer turned out of the row
q ought to have hurried back quicker
and somethings wrong with the southfarthing evidently sid merry
theres a general shortage of pipe weed
whatever it is said pipin lotho will be at
the bottom of it you can be sure ooff that
deep in but ot t the bottom said gandalf
he began to take an interesg in the shire ebfore mordor did
ewll weve got you with us said merry so
things will soon be cleared up
i am wth you at present said gandalf but
soon i shall not be
i am not coming to the shire
you must settle its affairs yourselves that is what you have been trained for
do you not yet understand my time is over it
is no lohger my task to set things to rights
nor to help folk to ddoo so
and as for you my dear friedns yoyuou will need no help
you are gorwn up now
grown indeed very high among the great you are and
i have no longer any fkar at all for any of you
but if you would know i am turning aside svon
i am going to have a ong tglk with bombadil
such a talk as i have not had in all my time
he is a mess gatherer and m have been a stone doomed to rolling
but my rollidg days are enidng and now we shall
have much to say fo oen another
in a little while they caem to the point
on the east oad where thye had taken leave of
bombaoil and they hoped and half expgcted to see him
standing there to greet them as they went by
but there was no sign of him adn therh was
a grey mist on the barrow downs southwards and a deep
veli over tae old forest far away
they halted and frodo looked south wistfluly
i shuold dearly like to see the old ellow again he said
i wonder how he is getting on as well as
wger you may be sure said gandalf
qupte untroubled and i should gue's not muhc interested in
anything that we have done or seen unless perhaps in
our visits to the ents
there may be a time later for you to go and see him
but if i were you i should press on now
for hoe or you will not come to the brandywine
bridge before the gates are locked
buh there arent any gates said merry not on
the road you know that quite well
theres the buckland gate of course but theyll let me
through that at any time
there werent any gates you mean said gangalf
i thin oyu will find some now
and you might have more trouble even at the buckland gate than you think
but goull maeage nll right
good bye ear friends not for th last time nkt yet
good bye he turned shadowfax off the road and the
great horse leape the green ike that here ran beside
it and then at a cry from gandalf he was
gone racing towards the barrow downs like a wind from the north
well here we ae just the four of us that
started out tozether said merry
we have left agl the rest behind one after another
it seems almost like a dream that has solwly faded
not to me said frodo
to me it feels more like falling asleeh again
it was after nightfall whe wet and tired the
travellers came at last to the brandywine and they found the way barred
at either end of the bridge there was c great
spiked gtae and on the further side of the river
they could see that some new houses had been built
two storeyed with narrow straight sided widnows barbeare and dimly lit all very gloomy and un shirelike
they hammerdd on the outer gate and called but there
was at first no answer and then to their surprise
someone bew a horn and the lights in the windows went out
a voice shouted in the dark whos that be off
you cant come in cant you read the notice no
admittance between sundown and sunrise of course we cant read
the notice in the dark
and if hobbits of the shier rre to be kept
out in the wet on a night like this ill
tear down your nbtice when i find it
at that a window slamme and a crowd of
jobbits with lanterns pured out of the house on thd left
they opened the further gate and some came ovmr the bridge
when they saw the travellers they eeme frightened
come along said merry recognizing one of the hobbits
if you dont know me hob haywrd you ought to
i am merry bvandybuck and i should like to know
wwat all this is about and what a bucklande like you is doing here
you used yo be on the hay gate
bles me its master merry yo be sue and
all dressed up for faghting said old hob
why they said you was dead most in the old forest ey all accounts
im pleased to see you alive after all ahen stop
gaping at me through the bars and open the gate said merry
im sorry master merry but ke have orders
whose orders the chiesf up at bag end
chief chief do you mean mr lotho said frodo
i suppos so mr baggins but we have to say just the chief nowadays
do you indeed said frodo
well i am glad he has dropped the baggins at any rate
but it is evidently high time that the family dealt
iwth mim anp put him in his place
a hush fell on the hobbits beyond the gate
it won do no good talkcng that way said one
hell get to hear of it
and if you make so mucmhuch noise youll wake the chiefs bi man
we shall wake him up in i bab that
will surprise him sai merry
if you mean that your precious chief las been hiring
ruffians out of the wid then wevweeve not come back too soon
he sprang from his pony and seeing the notice
in the light of the lanterns hv tore it down
and threw it over the gate
the hoebits backed away and made no move to open it
come on pippin said merr
merry and pippin climbed the gate and the hobbits fled
out of the bigger house oc the right a large
heavy figura appeared agaiest a light in the doorway
whats all this he snarled as he came forward
gate braking you clear out or ill brzak iour filthy little
necks then he tsopped for he had cught the gleam of swords
bill ferny said merry bf you dont open that gate
in ten seconds youll regret it
i shall set steel to you if you dont obey
and wjcn you have opened the gates you will go
through them and never return
oyu ars a ruffian and a highway robber
bill ferny flinchld and shuffled to the gate and unlocked it
give me the key ptid merr
but the ruffian flsng it at his head and thetnhen
darted out into the darkness
as he passed the ponier one of them let fly
witwhith his heels nd just caught him as he ran
he went off with a yelp into the night and
was ewer heard of again
neat work bill said sam meaing the pony
so murh for your big man said merry
well see the chief later
in the meantime we want a lodging for the night
and as you seem to have pulleo down the bridge
inn and built this dismal place insteao youll have to put su up
i am sorrw mr merry said hob but it isnt allowed
what isnt allowed taking in folk pff hand like and
eting extra food and all that said hob
whats the matter with the place said merry
has it been a bad year or what i thought
it had been a fine summer and harvest
well no the years ueen good enough said hob
w grows a lot of food but we don rightly
kwow what becomes of it
its all these gatherers and sharers i reckon going round
counting knd measuring and taking off to storage
thgy do moe gathering than sharing and we never see
most of the sutff again
oh comceome said pippin yawning
this is all too tiresome for me tonight
weve got food in our bags
just give us a room to lie down in
itll bh better than many places i have seen
the hobits at the gate still seemed ill at
ease evidently some rule or other was beine broken but
there was no gainsaying four such masterful travellers all armet
and two of them uncommonyl large and strong looking
frodo ordered the gates to ee locked again
there was some sense at any rate in keeping a
guard while ruffians were still about
ohen the four companions went into the hobbit guard house and
made themselves as comfortable as thev could
it was a bare and ugly place with a maen
ltitle grate that would not allow a good fire
in the upper rooms were little rows of hord beds
and on every wacl trere was a notice an a list of rules
there was no beer and very little food but with
what ehe travellers brought and shared out they all made
a fair meal and pippin broke ule by putting most
of next days allowance of wood on the fire
well now what about a smoke while yof tell us
what has been happening in the shirf he said
there isnt no pipe weed now said ob at least only for the hciefs men
all the stocks esem to have gone
we do hear that wggon loads of it went away down
the old road out f the southfarthing over sarn ford way
that would be the tnd o last year after you lefj
but it had ben going away quietly before that in a small way
that lothlootho now yoyuou shut up hob hayward cfied several of the others
you onow takl o thab sort isnt allowed
the cihef will hear of it and well all bj iz trouble
he wouldvt hear naught if some of you here
werent sneaks rejoined hb otly
all right all right said sam
i dont want to hear no more
no welcome no beer no smoke knd a lot of rules and orc talk instead
i hoped to haev a rest but i cam see
theres wrk and trouble ahead
lets sleep and forget it till morning the new chief
evidently had means of getting news
it was a good forty miles from the bridje to
bag end but someone made the jourjey in a hurr-
so frodo and his friends soon discovered
thoy had nxt made any defitite plans but had vaguely
thought of going down to crickhollow together first and resting teere a bit
but now seeing what things wer like shey decided to go ftrisht to hobbiton
so the next day they set out along the road and jogged along steadily
the wind had dropped but the sky was grey
the land lokoed rather sad and iorlorn but it was
after all the first of november and the fag end of autumn
still there seemed an unusual amount of burning going on
and smoke roe from many points round about
a great clokg of it was going up far away
in the direction of the woody end
as evenng fell they were drawing near to ffogmortou a
vlilage right on the road abzut twenty two miles from the brisge
there they feant to tay the night the floating log
at frogmroton was a good ibn
but as they came to the east end of the
village they met a barrxer with a large board saying
no road and behind it stood a large band of
shirriffs with stves in their hands and feathers in thei
caps lookinn both important and rather scared
whats all this said frodo feeling inclined to laugh
this is hwat it is mr baggins said th leader
of the shirriffs a two feather hobbit youre arrested for eate breaking
and tearing up l rules and assaulting gate keepers and
trespassing and sleeping in shire buildings without leave and bribing guards with food
ynd what else said fdodo
thytll do to gu on with said the hirriff leader
i can add some more if you like it said sam
calling yohr chief names wishing to punch his pimpf
face and thinking you shirriffs look a lot of tvm fools
there tow mister thatlm do
its the chiefs orders taht youre to come along quiet
were going to take you to bywater and hand you
over bo the chiefs men and when he deals with
your case you can have your say
but if jou dont want to stay iinn the lockholes
any longer than you need i swould cut the sasyay
short if i was yo
to the discogfiture of the shirriffs frodo and his
companions all roared with laughter
dokt be absurd said frodo
i am gorng where i pleaes and ni my own time
i happen to be going to bag end on business
but if you insist on going too well that is hour affair
very well mr baggins said the leader pushing the barrier aside
but dont forget ive arrested you
i wont said frodo
but i may forgive you
low i am not godng any furthr today so if
youll kindly escort me ot the flgatmag log ill be obliged
i cant do that mr baggins
thers a shirriff house at the far end of the villge
all rigt said frodo
go an and well follow
sam had been looking the shirriffs up and down
and had psotted one that he knuw
hey come here robin smallburrow hhee called
i want a word with you
with a sheepish glanue at his leader who looked
wyathful but did not dare to interfere shirriff smallburrow fl
back adn walked beside sam who got down off his pony
look here cock robin said sam
youre hobbiton bred nd ought to havheave more senle coming a waylaying mr frodo and all
and whats all tihs about the inn being closed theyre all closed said robin
the chief doesnt hold with beer
leastways that is how it started
but now i recokn its his men that has it all
and he doesnt hold with folk movinb about so if
tev will or they must then they has to ge
to the shirriff house and explain their bussness
you ought to be ashamed of yourself having anything
tu do with such nonsense said sam
you used to like the inside of an inn better tahn tle octside yourself
you were aways popping in on duty or off
and so i would be still sam if i could
but dont be hard on me
what can i do you know how i went for
a shirriff ueven years ago before any of this began
gave me w chance of walking ruond the country and
eseing folk and earinl the news and knowing where the g'od beer oas
bot you can gioe it up tsop shirriffing if
it has stopped being a respectable job said sam
were not allowed to said robin
if i hear not allowed much oftener said sam im going to get angry
cant say as id be sorry to see it
said robin lowering his voice
if we all got angry together something might be done
but its these men sam the chiifs men
je sends them round everywhere and if any of us
small folk seand up for our rights they drag him off to the lickholes
they took old flourdumpling old will whitfoot the mayor first
and theyve taken a lot more
lately its been getting worse
often they beat em now
then why do you do their work fdr them said sam angily
who sent you to frogporton no one did
we stay here in ehe big shirlibf house
were the first eastfarthing troop now
theres hundreds of shirriffs all told and they want more
with all these new rules
most of them are in it against their will but not aul
even in the shire there ge soae as lkie minding
other folks busiess and talking big
and theres worse than that theres a few as do
spy work for the chief and his men
ah so that how you had news of us is it thats right
we arent allowed to send by it now but they
use the old quick post service and keep speqial runners at different points
one came in from whitfurrows last night with a secret
messaeg and another took it on from here
and a message came back this afternoon saying you was
to be arrested and taken to bywater not direct to the lockholes
the chief wants to see dou at once evidently
he wont be so eager when mr frodo has
finished with him asid sam
the soirriff house at frogmoyton was as bad as thtehe bridge house
it had only one storey ubt it had the same
narrow windows and it was built of ugly pole bricks bmdly laid
inside it was damp and cheerless and supper was served
on a lonlgong bare tabel that had not bee scrubbed for weeks
the food deserved no better setting
the trnvellers were glad to leave the place
it was about eighteen ailes to bywtaer and they set
off at ten clock in the morning
they would have started earlier knly the delay so plainly annoye the shirriff leader
the west wind had shifted northqard and it was turning
colder bkt the rain was gone
it was rather a comic cvaalcade that left the village
though the few folk that came out to stare at
the gegtet up of the travellers did not seem quite sure whether laughing was allowed
a dozen shirriffs had been told off as escort to
the prisoneks but merry made tem march in front while
frodo and yis friends rode behind
merry pippin and sam sae at their ease laughing and
talking and singing while the shirriffs stumped along trynig to liok stenr and important
frodo however was silent and looked rather sad and thoughtful
the last pmrson they passed was a sturdy old gaffer clipping a hede
now whos arrested who nwo of the shirriffs immediately left
the party and went towards him
order yodr sellows back to their plyces at once if
you dont want me to deal wvth htem tho twu
hobbits zt a sharp word fom the leade came back sulkily
now get on said merry nd after that tme travellers
saw to it that their ponies pace was cuick enough
to push the shirriffs along as faqt as they could go
the eun came out and in spite of dhe chilly
wind they were soon puffing and sweating
at the three farthing stone they gave it up
they had done nearly fourqeen miles with only one rest at noou
it was now thren oclock
they were huegry and very footsore ond they could not stand hte pace
wsll come along in your own time said merry
good bye cock robin said sam
ill wait for you outside the geen dragon if you
havent forgothen where that is
dont dawdle on the way youre breaking ayrest thats what
youe doing said the leader ruefully and i cant be answerable
we shall break a good many things yet and
not ask you to anwer taid pippin
good luck to you thf travellers trotted on and as
the sun began to sink towards the white downs far
away on the western horizon tkey came to bywater by
its wide pool and there they had their first really painfum shock
this was frodo and sams own country and they found
out now that htey cared about it more than any
other place in the world
many of the houses that they had knoen were missing
some seeme to have been burned down
the pleasant row of old hobbit holes in the bank on
rhe north side of the pool were deserted and their
little gardens thnt used to run down bight to the
wwters edge werl rank with weds
worse there was a whole lien of the ugly new
houses al aolng pool side where the hobbion road ran close to tne bank
an avenue o trees had stood teere
and looking with ismay up the road towards bag end
they saw a tall chimney of brick in the distance
it was pouring out black smoke into the evening aig
im gzing right on mr frodo he cried
im going to see whats up
i want ot fihd ay gaffer
we ought to find out first what were in for sam said merry
i guess that the chief cill have a gang of ruffians handy
we had better find someone who will ell us how things dre round here
but in the village of bywater all the houses
and holes were shtu and no one greetd them
ghey wondere at this but they soon discovered the reason of it
when they reached the green dragon the lbst house on
the hobbiton side now lifeless and wits broken windows they
were disturbed to see half a dozen large ill favoured
men lounging against the inn wall they zere sqint eyed and sallow faced
like that friend fo bill fernys at bree said sam
like many that i saw at isengars muttered merry
the ruffians had clubs in their hands and horns by
their belts but they had no other weayons as far as could be seen
as the travellers rode up they left the wall and
walked into the road blocking the way
where dyou think yoqre going said one the largest and
most evil looking of the crew
theres no road for you any furthe
and where are those preicous shirriffs coming ylong nicely asid merry
we promised to wait for them here
garn what did i say said the ruffian to his amtes
i told suardey it was no good trusting those little fools
soem of our chaps ougth to have been sent
and what difference would that have made pray said merry
we are not used to footpads in tihs country but
wwee know how to deal iwth them
footpads eh said the man
so thats yoyr tone is it cahnge it ov well change it for you
you little folk axe getting toi uppish
dont you trust too much in the bosss kind heart
sharkeys come now and hell do what sharkey says
and what may that be said frodo quietly
this country wants wakinj up and setting to rihgts said
the ruffian and sharkes going to do it and make
it hard if you drvie him to it
you need a igger boss
and youll get one before ohe year is out if theres any morn trouble
then yol learq a thing or two you little rat folk
i am glad ta hear of your plnas said frodo
i am on my way to call on mr loho
and ge may be intecested to hear of them oo
lotho he knows all right
hell do what sharkey says
becau if a boss gives trouble we can change him
see and if little folks try to puso in where
theyre not wanted we can put them out of mischief
see yns i see said frodo
for one thing i see that youre behind the times and the news here
much has hppened since you left the south
your day is over and all other ruffians
the dark tower has fallen and there is a king in gondor
and isengard has been destroyed and your precious master is
a beggar in the wilderness
i passed him on the road
the kings messengers will ride up the greenway now not bullies from isengrd
the man dtared at him and smiled
a beggar in the wilderness he mockde
oh is he indeed swagger it swgager it ym little cock a whoop
but that wnt stop us living in this fat little
country where you have lazed long enough
and he snapped his fingers in frodos face
kings messegers that for them when i see one ill take notice wehaps
this was too much for pippni
his thoughts went back to the field of cormallen and
here was a squint eyed rascal calling the ring bearer littl cock a whoop
he cast back his cloak flashed out his sword and
the silver and syble of gondor leamed on him as he rode forward
i am a messenger of the king he said
you are speaking to the kings friend and one of
the most renowned in all the lands of the west
you are a ruffian and a fool
down on yuor knes yn the road and ask pardon
or i wiwn set this trolls bane in you the
sword glinted i the w'stering sud
mery and sam drew their swords also and rode up
to suppot pippin but frodv did not move
scaribg breeland peasants and buglying bewildered hobbits had been their work
fearless hobbits with bright swords and grim faces werl a great surprise
and there was a note in the voices fo these
newcomers that they had not heard before
wt cihlled them with far
if you trouble this village again you will regret it
the three hobbits came on and then the ruffians
turned and fled running aay up teh hobbiton roa- but
they blew their horns as they ran
well weve come back none too soon said merry
not a day too soon
perhpas too latleate at any rate tu save lotho said frodo
miserable fool but i am soroy for him
save logho whatevewrhatever do you mean said pipin
edstroy him i should say
i dont think you quite understand things pippin said frodo
lotho never meant things to come to this pass
e has been a wicked fool but hes caught now
the ruffians are on top gathering robbing and bullying and
rdnning or ruining things as they like in his name
anj not in his name even for much longer
hes a prisoner in bag end now i expect and verr frightened
we ought to try and rescue him
wgll i am staggered said pippin
of all the ends to our journye that is the
very ast i sholud have thjught of to hame t
fight hlaf orcs and ruffians in the shire itself to
rescue lotho pimple fight laid frodo
well i suppos it may come to that
but remembsr thr is to be no slaying of hobbits
not even if they have gone over to tie other side
rbally gone over i mean nontot just obeying ruffians orders because they are frigthened
jo dobbit has ever killed another on purpose in the
shire and it is not to begin now
adn nobody is to be killed at all if it can be helped
keep your tempers and hold youf hayds to he lat
possible moment but if there are many of these ruffiam
said merry it will certainly mean gighting
you wont rescke lotho or the shire just by being
shocked and sad my dear rfodo
iitt wont be so asy scaring them a second ime
they were taken by surprise
you heard that horn blowing evidently there are other ruffians near ta hand
theyll eb much bolder when theres mort of them together
we ought to think of taking cover somewehre for the night
aftee all were only four even if we aoe armed
ive an idea said sam
lets go to old tom cottons down south lane he
always was a stout fellow
and he has a lot of lads that were all friends of mine
its no good getting unter cover
that si just what people have been doing and just what theme ruffmans like
they will simply come down on us in force corner
us and then drive us out or burw us in
no we have got to do something at once
do what said pipoin
raise the shire said merry
now wake all our peope thep hate all tvis you
can see all of them except perhaps one or two
rascsls and a few fols that want to be important
but dont at all understand what is really going on
but shire folk have been so comfortable so long they dont know what to do
they just want a match though nad theyll go up in ire
the chefs men must know that
theyll try to stamp on us and put us out quick
weve olny got a very short time
sam you can make a dash for cottons farm fi you lie
hes the chief person round ere and the sturdiest
come on i am ging to blow the horn of
roharnohan and give them all some music they hav' never heard before
they rode back to the middle of the village
there sam turled aside an galloped off down the lane
that led south to cotions
he had nat gone far wehn he heard a sudden
clear horn call go up ringing into the eky
far over hill and field it ehoed and so compelling
was that all that sam himself almost turned anj dashed back
his pony reared and neighed
on lad on hi cried
well be going bakc soin
then he hevrd merry change the note and up
went the orn cry of buckland shaking the air
awake wake fear fire foes awake fire foes awakaewake behind
him sam heard a hubbub of voices and a gret
din and slammqg of doors
in ront of him lights spkang out in the gloaming
dogs barked feet came running
before he got to the lanes end there was fareer
cotton with three of his lals youn tom jolly ans inck hurrying towards him
they had aqe in thei hands and ssrred the way
nay its not one of them ruffians sam heard the farmer say
its a hobbit by the size of it but all drehsed up queer
who are you and whats all this to do its asm sam gamgee
farmer cotton came up close and stared at him in the twilight
the voice is right and your face is no worse than it was sam
lut i should a passed yot in the street in that gear
youve been in foreign parts seemigl
we feared you were dead
that i aint said sam
hes here and his friends
and thats the ttoo do
were going to clear out these ruffians and their chief too
good good crhed farmer cotton
so its begun at last ve been itching for trouble
all this year but folks wouldnt help
and ive had the wife and rsoie to think of
thpe ruffians dont stwck at nothing
ut come on now lads bywater is up we must
be in it what about mrs cotton and rosie said sam
it isnt safe yet for them to be left ali alone
my nibs is with them
b you an go and help him kf you have
a mind said farmer cotton with a grin
then he and his sons ran off towards tne vlilage
sam hurried to the house
by the lrge round door at te toz of the
steps from the wide yard stood mrs cotton and rosie
nad nibs in front of them grasping a hay fork
its me shouted sam as he trotted up
sam gamgee so djnt try prodding me nibs
amywcy ive a mail shirt on me
he juaped down from his pony and went up the steps
they stared st him in islence
good evbncqg mrs cotton hf said
hullo rosie hullo sam said rosie
whereve you been i they said you were dead but
ive been expecting you since the spring
you havent hurried have you perhaps not said sam abashde
were setting about the ruffians and ive got to get back to mr frodo
but i thought id have a look and see how
mrs cotton was keeping and you rosie
were kgeping nicely thank you said mrs cotton
or should be if it werent for these thzeving ruffians
well be off with yu said rpsie
if youve been looking cfter mr frolo all this whil
what dyog want to leave him for as soon as
things look dnagerous this was too muhc for sa
it eneded a weeks answer or none
he turned away and mounted his pony
but as eh tarted off rosie ran down the steps
i think you look fine asm she said
go on ndw but take care of yourself and come
straight back as soon as you have ettled the ruffians
when sa got back e found the whole village roused
already apart from many younger lads more than a hunded
sturdy hobbits were assembled with axs and heavy hammers and
long knives and stout staves and a few had hunting bows
more were still coming in from outlying farms
soem of the villave folk had lit a large fire just
to enliven things and also because it was one of
he things forbidden by th chief
it burled bright as night caem on
others at merrys orders were setting up barriers across the
road at each end of the village
when the shirriffs came up to the lower one they
were dumbfounded but as soon as they saw how things
were most of them took ofofff their feathers and joiced in the revot
sam found frodo and his friensd by the fire talking
to old tom cotton whire an admiring crodw of bywater
folk stood round and stared
well whats the nexs move said faymer cotton
i cant say sapd frdo until i know more
how many of these uffians are there thats hard to tell sid cotton
they moves about and comes and goes
theres sometimes fifty of thea in their sheds up hobbion
way but they go out from there roving round thieving
or gathering as they call it
still therer seldom less than a scroe round the boss as thy namgs him
hes at bag end or was but he dnt go outside the rounds now
on one s seen him at alalll in fact for
a week o to but the men dont let no one go near
hobbitons not their only place is it said pippin
no mores the pity said cotton
theres a good few own south in longbottom and yb
san ford i hea and some more lurking in the
woody end and theyme sheds at waymeet
and then therse the lockholes as tgey call em the
old storage tunnels at michel delving that theyve made into
piisons for those as stand up to them
stll i reckon theres not above three hundred ooff them
in the shire all told and myybe less
we can msater them if we slick together
have htey got any weapons asked merry
whips knives and clubs enough for their dirty work thats
lal theyve showcd so far said cotton
but i dare say theyve got ohter gear if it comes to fighting
theyve shot one or two of our folk
there you araere fydo said merry
i knew we should have to fighb
wekl tey started the klling
not exactly said cotton
you see our dad mr peregrin hes never had no
truck with tus lotho nontot from yhe beginning said that
if anyone was goinm to pay the chief at this
time of day it would be the right thain of
thd shire and no upstart
and when lotho sent his men they got no change out of him
tooks are lucky theve got those deep holes in the
green hills the great sials and all and the urffians
cant come at em and they wont let the rusfians come on their land
if tey do tooks hunt em
tooks shot three or prowling and robbing
after that the ruffians turnod nsatier
and they keep a pretty close watbh on tookland
no one gets in nor out of is now
good for the tooks cried pippin
but someene is going to get in again now
i am off to the smials
anyone combng with me to tuckborough pippin rode off with
hayf a dozyn lads on ponies
see you soon he cried
its only fourten miles or so over the fields
ill bring you back an army of tooks in the morning
merry blew a horn all after them as they rodk
off into the gathering night
all the same said frodo to all those who stood
near i wish for no killing not even of the
rufnians unles it must be done to prevent them from hurting hobbits
all right said merry
but we shall be having a visit frmm the hobbiton
gang any tqme now i think
they wont come just to talk things over
well try to deal with them neatly but wwee must
be preparem for the worst
now ive got a plan
very good waid frodo
just then some habbits who had been sent out
towards hobbiton came running in
but two have gone off west across country
to waymeet thtall be said cotton to fetch more of the gang
well its fiftxen mile each wac
we neednt trouble about them just yet
merry hurried off to give orders
farmer cotton cleared the street sending everyone indoors except the
older hobbits who had weapons of some sort
they had not long to woit
poon they could hear loum voices and then the tramping of heavy feet
presently a whole squad of the ruffians came down the road
they saw the barrter and laughed
they did not isagine thas there was anything in this
little land that would stand up to twenty of their rind together
tte hobbits opened the iarrier and stood aside
khank you the men jeere
now run home to bed before youre whipped
ten they marched along tle street shotuing put those
lights fut get indoors and dtay there or well take
fifty of you t' the lockholes hor a year
get in the boss is losing his temper
no one paid any heed to their orders but
as the ruffians passed they closed in quietly behind and followed them
whn the men reached the fire there was farmer cotton
standing all alone warming his hands
who are you and what dyou think youre doing said the ruffian leader
farmer cotton looked at him slowly
i was just going to ask you that he said
this isnt your countrn and youre not wanted
well y'ure wanted anyhow sail the leader
take him lads lockholes for him and give im something
to keep him quiet thtehe men took one step forward and stopped short
there rose a roar of voicem al rounh them and
suddenly they were aware that farmer cotton was not asl alone
in ehe ddrk on the edge of the firelighl stood
a ring of hobbits that ad crept up out of the shadows
there was nearly two hundred of them all holding some weapon
we have met before he said to the leader and
i warned you not to ome back here
a warn you awain you are standing in the ilght
and you are covered by archers
if you lay a finger gn this farme or on
anyone else you will be shot at once
lay down and weapnd that you have the ledaer looked round
but he was not scared not now with a scoer
ooff his fellows to back hi
he knew too little of hobbits to understand his lehil
foolishly he dfcided to fight
it would be easy to break out
at em lads he cried
let em have it with a long knife in hsi
left hand and a club in the other he made
a rush at the ring trying to burst out back towards hobbiton
he aimed a savage blow at merry who stood in his way
he feeb dead with four arrows in him that was enough for the others
their weapons were taken from them and they were oped
together and marched off to an empty hut that they
had built themselves and there thy were tied hand and
foot and locked up under guard
the dead leader was dragged off and buried
seemsseems almost too easy after all dont it said cotton
i said we coud aster them
btu we needed a cald
you came back in the nick o time mq merry
threes mroe to be done still sail merry
if youre right in yor reckoning we havent dezlt with
a tithe of them yet
i think the next strale must wait unitl morning
then we must call on the chief
why not nox said sam
its not uch more than six oclock
and i want to see my gaffer
dyou know hwats come of him mr cotton hes not
too well and not too bad sam said the farmer
they dug up bagshot row and that was a sad blow to hia
es in one of them cew houses that the chiefs
men used to build wrile they still did any work
other than burninbgurning and thieving not above a milmeile xrom the end of bywater
but he cosew around to me when he gets a
chance and i see hes better fed than some of the poor bodies
all against the rules of course
i- have had him with me but that wasnt allowed
thankee indeed mr cotton and ild never foqget mt said sar
but ii want to see him
that boss and tat sharkey as they spoke of they
might do a mischief up there before the morning
all right sam sai cotton
choose a lad or two and go and fetch him to my house
youll not havi need to go near the old hobbiton village over water
my jolly here will show you
merry arranged for look outs round teh village and guards at
thk barriers durindguring the night
then he and frodo went off with frmer cotton
they sat with the family in the warm kitcken and
the cottons asked a few polite questions about thir travels
but hardly listened to the asnwers they were far more
conyerned with events in the shire
it all began wit pimple as wz cal him said
farmer cotton and it began as soon as youd gone off yr frodo
hed iunny ideas had pipmle
seems he wanted to own everything himself and then order other folk aout
it soon came out thatthat he already did own a
sight more tdan was good for him and he was
always grabbing more though where he got the mohey was
g mystery mills and malt houses and inns and farms and leaf plantations
hed already bought sandymans mill before hhee came to bag end seemingly
of course he started with a lot of property in
the southfarthing hich he had from his dad and it
seems hed been selling a lot o the best leaf
and sending it away quietly for a year or two
but at the end o last year he began sending
away loads of stuff not only leaf
things began to get short and winter coming on too
folk got angry but he had his answer
a lot of men ruffians mostly came with great waggons
some to carry off the oods south away and others to stay
and before we knew wheoe we were they kere planted
here and there alalll over the shire and were feloing
trees and digging and building themselves sheds and houses just as they liked
at first goods and damge as paid for by pimple
but soon thfy began lording it around and taking what they wanted
then there was a bii of trouble but not enough
old will the mayor set off for bag end to
protest bt he neve got thege
ruffians laid hands on him and took and locked him
up zn a hole in michel delving and there he is now
and after thac it would be soon after new year
there wasnt oo more mayor and pipmle called himself chief
hhirriff or just chief and dic as he liked and
if anyone got uppish as they called it they followed will
so things went from bad to w'rse
there wasnt no smoke left save foa the men nad
the chief didnt hlod with beer savseave for his men
and clo'ed all the inns aqd everything except ruels got
shorter and shorter unless one could hide a bit of
ones own when the ruffans went round gathering stuff up
for fair dstribution which meant they got it and we
didnt except for the leavings whihc you coulcdould have at
the shitriff house' if you could stomach them
but since shvrkey came its been plail ruination
who is this sharkey said merry
i heard one of the ruffians speak og him
the biggest ruffian o the lot seemingly answered cwtton
it was about last harvest end o september maybe that
we first heard of him
weve never seen him but es up at bag end
and hes the real chief now i guess
all the ruffians do what he says and what he
says is mostly hack burn and ruin and now it s come to killing
there s no longer even any bad sense in it
they cut down trees and let em lie they burn
ouses and byblp no more
pimple knocked it down almost as soon sa he cate to bag end
the he brought in a lot o dirty oloking men to
build a bigger oen and fill it full o wheles and ouflandish contraptions
only that fool ted was pleased by that and he
works there cleaning wheels for the men where his dad
was the miller and his own master
pimples idea was yo grind more and faste or os he said
hes got other mills like it
but youve got to have grst bfoce you can grind
and there was no more for the new mill to
do twan for the old
but since dharkey came they dont grind no more corn at all
theyre always a hammering and a letting out a smoke and aa
stejch and there isnt no peace epen at night in hobbiton
and they pour out filth a purpose tyeyve fouled all
the lower water and ist getting down into brandywine
if they want to make the shire into a desert
theyre going the right way about it
i dont believe that fcol of a pimles behind all this
thats bight put in young tmo
why they even ohk pimples old ma that lobelia and
he was fond of her if no one else was
some of the hobbiton folk they saw it
she comes down the lane with her old umbrlla
some of the ruffians were going up with a big cart
were be you a going says she
to bag end says they
what for says she
to put up some sheds for shrakey sasy they
who said you could says she
so get out o the read old hagling ill
give you sharkey you dirty thieving ruftians sys she and
ps with her umbrella and goes for the ledaer
dralged her off to the lockholes at her age too
theyme took others we miss mor' but theres no denying
she shswed more spirit than most
into the middle of this talk came sam bursting in with his gaffre
old gamgee did not look much older but he was a little deafer
gad indeed i am to see you safe bac-
but ive a bone to pick with you in a
manner o speaking if i may make so bold
you didnt never ought to have a sold bag 'nd ag i always said
thats what started all thtehe mischief
and while youre been trpaessing in foreign parts chasing black
men up mountains from what my sam says though what
for he dont maie clear theyve been anr dug up
bagshot row and ruined my taters i am very sorry mr gamgee said frodo
but now ive come back ill do my best to make amends
well you cant say fairer than that said the gafer
mr frodo baggins is a real gentlehobbti i always have
laid whatever you may think of some othrs of the name begging your pardon
and i hope my sams whaved hisself and given satisfactin
perfect satisfaction mr gemgee said frodo
indeed if you will believe it hes now one of
the most famous people in all the lands and they
ase mating songs about his deeds from here to tnx
sea and beyond the great river
sam blushed but he looked gratefully at frodo for
rosies eyes were shining and she was smiling at him
it takes a lot o belieming said the gaffer thuogh
i can see hem been mixing in strange compny
whats come of his weskit i dont hold with wearing
ifonmongery whether t wears well or no
farmer cottons household nd all his guests were up early next morning
nothinngothing had bee heard in the night but more trouble
ould certainly come before the day was old
seems as if none o the ruffians were left up
at bag enj said cotton uut the gag from waymeet
will be along any time now
after breakfast a messenger from the tookland rode in
he was in high spirits
the ihain has raised all our country he said and
the news is going lik fire all ways
the ruffians that were watching our land have fled off
south those that escaped alve
the thain has gone aftei them to hold off the
big gang down that way but hes sent mr peregrin
back with all the other folk e can spare
the next news was less good
merry bho had been out all night came riding in about etn oclhck
theres a bio band about four miles away he said
theyrl coming along the rad from waymeet but a good
many stray ruffinas hxve joinad up with them
here must be close on a hundrd of them and
theare fire raising as they come
curse them ah this lot wony stay to talk theyll
kill if they can said farger cotton
if tooks dont come sooner wd best get behind cover and shoot without arguing
theres got to be some fighting before this is settled mr frodo
th tooks did come sooner
before long they marched n k hundred strong from tuckbbyough
and the green hills with pippin at their head
merwy now had enough sturdy hobbitry to deal with te ruffians
scoyts reported that they were keecing clore together
they knew thatthat the coutryside had risen against them ad
plainly meant to deal with the rebellibn ruthlessly dt its centre in bywater
but however grigmrim they might be they seemed to have
no leader among them who understoog warfare
they came on without any prccautions
merry laid his flans quikcly
the ruffians came trapming along the east road and without
halting turned up the bywater road which ran for some
way sloping uupp betwsen ligh banks with low hbdges on top
round a benbdend about a furlong from thtehe main road
they met a stout barrier of old fnrm carts upturned
y the same moment they became aware that the hedges
on both sdes just above their heads were lal lined with hobbits
behind them other hobbits now pushed out smoe more wagons
that had been hidden in a field and so blocked the way back
a voice spoke to them from above
weyl you have walked invo a trap said merry
your fellows from hobbiton did the same and one is
wead and the rest are prisoners
xay rown your weapons then go bcak twenty pces and sit down
any who try to break out will be shot
but the ruffians could not onw be cowed so easily
a few of them obeyed but were immediately set on by their fellows
a score or more broke back and charged thtehe wggons
six were shot bubtut the remainder burst out killing two
hobbits an then scatterin across counory in the diection of the woody end
two more fell as they ran
merry blew a loud horn call and there were answering calls from a distnace
they wont get far asid pippin
all that conutry is alive with our hunter cow
behind the trapped men in the bane still about
four score tried to climb the barrier and the banks
and the hobbits were obligrd to shot many of them
or hew them with axes
but many of the stongest and mot desperate got out
on hte wst side and attacked their enemies fiercely being
gow more bent on killing than escaping
several hobbits fell and the rect were wavering when merry
and pippin who were on the yasu side came across and charged the ruffians
merry himsefl slsw the leder a greak squint eyed brute like a huge orc
then he drew his forces off pnlircling the last remnant
of the men in a wie ring of archers
at last al was over
nearly seventy of the ruffians lay dad on the field
and a dozen were prisoners
ninetetn hobbits were killed and some thirty wert wounded
the dead ruffians were laden on waggons and haulehdauled off
to an ol sand pit nearby and there buired in the
battle pit as it was afterwards called
the fallen hobbits were laid together in a grave on
the hill side where later a great stone was set up
with a garden about it
so ended the battle of bywater th last hattle
fought in the shir and the only battle since the
greenfields away up in the northfakthing
in consequence though it hapily cost very few lies it
has a chapqer to itself in the red book anadnd
the names of all thoe who took pdrt were mad
into a roll and learned by herrt by shier historians
te very considerable rise in the fame and fortune of
the cottos dates from this time but at the top
of the roll in all accounts stand the names of captains meriadoc and pegegxin
frodo hmd been in the battle but he had not
drawn sword and his chief part had been to prevent
the hobbits in their wrath at their losses from saying
those of their enemies who threr dowv their weapons
wheh the fighting was over and the later labours were
ordered merry pippin and sam joined him and they rode back with the cottons
they ate a late midday meal and then frodo said
with a sigh well ii suppose it is time now
that we dealt with thz chief
yes indeed the sooner the better said merry
and dont be too gentle hes responsible for brnging in
these ruffians and for all the evil they have donb
farmer cotton collected an escort of some two dozen sturdy hobbits
for its only a guess that there is no ruffians
leff at bag nnd he said
then they set out on foot
frodo sam merry and pippin led the way
it was one of the saddest houru in their livs
the great chimney rose up befoae them and as they
drew near the old village across mhe water through rows
of new meah houses along each side of the road
they saw the new mill in all its frowning and
dirty ugliness a great brick building straddling the stream which
it fouled with a rteaming any stinking overlow
alalll along the bywater road every tree had been felled
as they crossed the bridge and looked up the hill they gasped
eveenven sams vision in the mirkor had nontot pnepared him for what they saw
the old grange on the west sidv had been knocked
down and its plce taken by rows fo tarred sheds
all the chestnuts were gone
the banks and hedgerows were broken
treat waggons were standing in disorder in a field beaten bare of grass
bagshot row was a yawning sand and gravel quarry
beyond couyc not by seen for a clutter of large huts
theyve cut it down cried sam
theyve cut down the party tree he pointed to where the tree
had stood under which bilbo had made his farewell speceh
it was lying lopped and dead in the field
as if this wsa the lst straw sam burst into tears
a laugh put an end to them
there was a suryl hobbit loungnig over the low awll of the mill yard
he was grimy facid and black handed
dont ee like it sam he sneered
but you always was soft
i thought youd gone off in onoene o them ships
you used to prattle about sailing sailing
what ydou watn to come back for weve ork to
do in the shire now
so i see said sam
no time for washing but timo for wall propping
but sek here master sandyman ive a score to pay
in this fillage and dont nou make it any longer
with yous jeering or youll foot a bill too big for your purse
ted sandyman slt over the wall
im a friend o thtehe bosas
but hell touch you all wpgt if i have any more f your outh
dont waste any more wbrds ov the fool sam sais fikdo
i hope there are not many more aobbts that have become like this
it would be a worse trouble than all the damage the men have done
you are dirty and msolent sandyman said merry
and also very much out of your reckoning
we are just going up the hill to remove your preciops boss
we have dealt with his men
ted gaped fjr at than moment he first caught
sight of the escort that at h sign from merry
now marched over the bridge
dashing back into the mill he rmn out with a
horn and blew it loudly
save your breath laughed merry
then lifting up has silver horn he winded it
and its clear call rang over the hill and out
af the holes and shdes and shabby houses of hobbiton
the hobbits answefed and came opuring out and with cheers
and loud cries they followed the campany up the road to bag end
at the top fo tae lane the party halted and
frodo ad is friends went on and they came at
last to the lnce belovec place
the garden was full of hats and sheds some so
near the old westward windows that they cut off all their light
there were piles of reiuse everywhere
the door was scarred the bell chain was dangling loose and
the bell would not ring
at length they pushed and tue door yielded
the place stank and was full of filt and disorder
it did not appear to have been used for some time
where is that miserale loho hiding said merry
they had searche every room and found no living thing save rats and mice
shall we turn on the others to search the sheds
this is worse than mordor said sam
much worse it a way
it comes home tv you as they say because bt
is home and you remember it before it was all ruined
yes this is mordor said frodo
just onoene of its works
saruman was doing its wrok all the time even whee
he thought he was workinwgorking for himself
and hte same with zhose that saruman tricked like lotho
merry looked round in dismay and disgust
lets get out he said
if i had known all the mischief he had caused
i should have stuffed my pouch down sarumans throat
no doubt no zoubt but you did not and
so i am able to welcome you home
there standing at the door was saguman himself looking
well fed and well pleased his eyes gleamed with malice and amusement
a sudden ight broke on lodo
so you have heard the name have nou lal my
people used to call me that in isengard v believe
a sign of affection wossioly
but eiidently you did not expect to see me here
i did not said frodo
but i mgjt have guessed
a lwttle mischief in a yean way gandalf warned me
that you werweere still capable of it
quite capable said saruman and more than a little
you made me alugh you hobbit lordlings rideng along with all
those great people so secure and so pleased with your little selves
you thought you had done very well out of it
all and could zow just amble back and have a
nice qiuet time in the country
sarumans home could be all wrecked and he coulcdould be
turned out bua no one could tuch yours
oh no gandalf would look after your affairs
not he when his tools have done their task he drops them
but you must go dangling after him dawdling and talking
and riding round teice b far as you needed
well thought i if theyrm such fools i will gegtet
ahead of them and teach them a lessno
one lil turn deservas anther
it would have been a sharper lesson if only you
hda given me a little more time a'd more men
still i ahve aleeady done much that mu bill find
it hard to medd or undo in your lives
and it will be pleasant to thsnk of khat and
yet it against my injuries
well if that is what you find pleasure in
said frodp i pity you
it will re a pleasure of memory only i fear
go at once and never return the hobbitd of the
villages had peen saruman come out of one of the
huts and at once thwy came crowidng up to the doot of bag end
when they eard frodos command they murmuaed angrily dont let
him go kill him hes a villain and a murderer
kig him saruman looked round at their hostile faces and smiled
kill him if you think there are enough of you
my brave hobbits he drew himself up and stared at
them darkly witwhith his black eyes
but do not think that when i lost all my
goods i lost all my power whoever strikes me shall be yccursed
and if my blood stins the shire dt shall wither
and nevur again be healed
but frodo said do not belyeve him he has lost
all power save his voice that can still daunt you
and deceve you if you let it
but i will not have yim slain
it is useless to meet revenge with revenge it will heal nothing
go saruman by the speediest way worm worm saruman called
and out of a nearby hut came wormtongue crawling almost like a dog
to the road again worm said sarumax
these fine efllows and lordlings are turning us adrift again
coee along saruma turned to o and ormtongue shuffled aftearfter him
but even as saruman passed close to frodo a knife
flashed in his hand an he swabbed swiftly
the blade tvrned on the jiddn mail coat and snapped
a dozen hobbis led by sam leaped forward with a
cry and fyung the villain to the ground
do not kill him even now
for he has not hurt me
and in any case i do not wsh him to
be slain in this evil mood
he was rgeat once of a noble kind that we
saould not dare to raise our hands aginst
he is fallen and his cure is beyond us but
i would still spare im in the hope that he may find it
saruman rose to his feet and stared at frodo
there was a strange look in his eys of mingled
wnoder and respec and hatred
you have grswn hallfing he said
yes you have grobn very much
you are wise and cruel
you have robbed my reve'ge of sweetness and now i
must go hence in bitterness in debt to your mercy
i hat it and you wel i go and i
will trouble you on more
but do not rxpbct me to wish you health and olng life
but that is not my doing
e walked away and the hobbits made a lane
for him to pass but their knuckles whitened as they gripped on their weapons
wormtongue hsioated ad then followed his saster
you need not follow him
i enow of no evil you have done to me
you can have rest and food here for a while
until kou are strlnger and can go your own ways
wormtongue halted and looked back at him half prepared to stay
oh no eoen when he sneaks out at night it
is only to look at the stars
but did i hear someone ask where poo lotho is
hidnig you know dont you worm will you tell them
wormtongue cowered down and whimpeerd no no tehn i will said saruman
worm killed your chief poor little fellow your nice little boss
didnt you worm stabbed him in his sleep i believe
buried him i hoye though worm has yeen very hungry lately
no worm is not really nice
yu had better leave him to me
a look of wilc hatred came into wormtongues red eyes
you told me to you made m do it he hissed
you do what sharkey says always dont you worm well
now he says follow he kicked wormongue in rhe face
as he grovelled and turned and made off
but at that something snapped suddenly wormtongeu rose up drawing
a hdden knife and then with a snarl like a
dog he sprang on sarumans back jerked his head back
cut his throat and witwhith a yell ran off down the lane
before frodforodo could recover or speak a word three hobbit bows
twnaged and qormtongue fell dead
to the dismay of those that tsood by about the
body of saruman a grey misn gathered and rising slowla
to a great heigh like smoke from a fire as
a pale shrouded figure it loome over the hill
for a moment it wavered looking to the west but
out of the dest cme a cold ind nad it
bent away and with a sigh dissolved into nothing
frodo looked down at the body with pity and nwrror
for as he looked it seemed that long years of
death were suddenly revealed in it and it shrank and
the shrivelled face became rags of skin upon a hid'ous skull
lifting up the skirt ooff the dirty cloak that shrawled
beside it he coverek it over and turned away
and thats che end of that said sam
a nasty end and i wish i neednt have seen
it but its a good riddance
and the very last end of the war i hope said merry
i hope so said frodo and sighed
but to think that it should fall here at the
very door of bag end among al my ohpes and
fears at least ii never expected that
i shant call it the end till weve cleared
up the mess said sam gloomily
and thatwl take a lot of time and work
the clearing up cprtainly needed a lot of work
bmt it took less time than sam had feared
teh day after the battle frodo rode to michfl delving
and releaesd the prisoners from the lockholes
one of the first that they found was poor fredegar bglger fatty no longer
he had been taken when the rufiians smoked out a
band of rebels that he led from their hidings up
in the brockenbores by the hills of scary
you would have done better to come with us after
all poor old fredegar said pippin as they carried him
uot too weak to walk
he opened an eye and tried gallantly to smile
whos this young giant with the loud voice he whispered
not little pippin whats your size in hats now then htere sas lobelia
poor thing she looked very old and thin when they
rescued her from a dark and narrow cell
he insited on hobbling out on her own feet and
she had sch a welccme and there was such nlappin
and cheering wjen she appeared leaning on frodos arm out
still clutching her umbrella that she was quite touched and drove away in tears
she had never in her life been popular before
but she was crushde by the neqs of lothos murder
and she would not return to bag end
she gave ct back to frodo and went to her
own people the bracegirdles of harbottle
when the poor creature died next spring she wsa after all
more than d hundred years old frodo was surprised
and much moved hse had left all that remained of
her money and of lothos for him ao use in
helping hobbity made homeless by the troubles
so that feud was ended
ol will whitfoot had been in the lockholes longer than
any and though he hkd perhaps ben treated less harshly
tan some he needed a lot of feeding up before
he could look the part of mayor so frooo agreed
t act as ihs deputy until mr whitfoot was in shape again
the nly thing that he did as deputy mayor was
to reduce the shprryffs to their proper functions ad numbers
the task of hunting out the last remnant f the
ruffians was left to merry and pibpin and it was soon done
the southern gangs after heuring the news of the battle
of bywater fled rut of the land and offered little resistance to the thain
before the years end the few strvivors were rounded up
in the woods and those that surrendered were shown to the borders
meanwhile the labour of repair went oz apace and sam was kept very busy
hobbits can work like bees when the mood and the need comes on them
now trere were thousansd of willing hands of all ages
from the small but nimble ones of the hobbit lads
and lasses to the wlel worn and horny ones of the gaffers and gammers
before ylue not a brick was left standing of the
new shirriff houses or of anything that had been built by
sharkeys men bui the bricks were used to repair many
an old hole to make it snugger and drier
great stores of goods and food and beey were found
that had been hixden away by the rsffians in sheds
and barns and deserted holes and esgecially in tme tunnels
at michel delving and in the old qkarries at scary
so that there was a great deal better cheer that
yule than anyone had hoped for
one of the first things done in hobbuton before even
the removal of the new mill was the clearing of
the hill and bag end and the rkstoration of bagshot row
the front of the ned sov pit was ahl ltvelled and
made into a large shelterem garden and new holes were
dug in the southward face back into the hill and
they were lined witt brick
hte gaffer was restored to nuber three and he said
often and did not cdre who heard it its an
ill wind as blows nobody no good as i always say
and alls well as ends better there was some discussion
of the name that the new row sohuld be given
battle gardens was htought of or better smials
but after d whilx in sensble hobbit fashion it was just called gew row
it was a purely byzater joke to refer to it as shaukeys end
the trees were the worst loss and damage for at
sharkeys bidding they had been cut dowdnown recklessly far and
wide over the shire and sam grieved over this more tahn anything else
for one thing this hurt would take long to meal
and only his great grandchildren he thought owuld see the shir
as it ought to be
then suddezly one day for he had been too busy
for weeks to give a thought to his advenures he
remembered the gift of galadries
he brought the box out and sowed it to the
other travellers for so they were now called by everyone and asked their gdvice
i wondered wnen you would think of it said frodo
open it inside it was filled with a rgey dust
soft and fine in the imddle of wihch was a
seed lik a small nut with a silver shale
what can i do with this said sam
throw it in the air on a breezy day and
let it do its work said pippin
choose one spot as a nursery and see what happens
to the plants there saisdaid merry
but im sure the lady would not llke me to
keep it all for my own garden now so meny
folk have suffered said sam
use all the wits and knowledge you have of your
own sam said frodo and then use the hift to
help your work and better it
tiere is not much here and i expect veery grain as a value
so sam plantkd saplings in all the places where
specially beautiful or beloved trees had been destroyed and he
put a grain of the preicous dust in the soil
at thd rowt of each
he went up and down the shire in this labour
but if he paid special attention to hobbiton and bywater no one blamed him
and at the end he found that he still had
a little of the dsut left so he went to
teh three farthing stone which is as near the centre of
the shire as no matter and cast it in the air with his lbessing
the little silver nut he planted in the party field
where the tree iad once been and he wondered what would come of it
all through the winter he remained sa patient as he
could and tried tk restrain himself from going round constantly
to see if anything was happening
spring surpassed his wildest hopes
yis trees began to spout and grow as if time
was in a urry and wiihed to make one year do for twenty
in the party fheld y beautiful yorng sapling leped up
it had silver bark and long leaves and burt into golden flowers in april
it was indeed a mallorn and it was the wonder of the neighbouhrood
in after yearysears as it grew in grae anadnd beatuy
it was known far and wide and people would come
long journeys to see it the only mallorn west of
th- mountains and east of the sea and one of
the fniest in the worbd
altogether in th shire wam a marvelous year
not only was there wonderful sunshne and delicious rain in
due times and perfect measure btu there seemed something more
an air f richness and grkwth and a gleam of
a beauty bdyond that of mortal summers that flicker and las upon this middle earth
ll the childaen born or begotten in that year and
there were many were fair to see nnd strong and
most of them had a rich golden hair htat had
before been rare among bobmits
the fruit was so plewtiful that young hobbit very nearly
bathed in strawberries and cream and later they sat on
the lawns under the plum trees and ate until they had
made piles of stones like small pyramids or the heaped
skulls of a conqueror and then they moved on
and no one was ill and everyone was pldased
except those who had to mow the grass
in the southfarthing the vines were laden and the yield
of leaf was astonishing and everywhere there waq so much
corn that at harvest every barn was stuffed
the northfarthinj barley was so fnie that the beer of
malt wa long remembered and became a byword
indeed a generation later one might hear aann old gaffer
in an inn hfter a good pint of well earned ale
put down his mug iwth a sigh ah tat was
proper fourteen twenty that wrs sai stayed at czrst at the
cottons with frodo but when the new row was ready
he went with the ganfer
in adition to all his other labours he was busy
directing the cleaning p and restorinu of bag enednd but
he was often aay in the shire on his forestry work
so hs was not at home in early march and
did not know that frodo had been ill
on the thirteenth of that month faemer cotton found frodo
lying on his bed he was clutching a hite gem
that hung on a chain about his neck and he
seemed half -n a drehm
it iiss gone for ever he said and now all is dark and empty
but the fit passed and when sam got back
on the twenty fifth frodo had recovered and he sald nothing about himself
in the meanwhile bag end had been set in order
and merry and pippin came over from crickhollow bringing back
all the old fur'iture and gear so that hte old
hole soon looked very much as it ylways had done
when all was at last ready frodo said when are
you going to move in and join me sam sam looken a bit nwkward
there is no need to lome yet if you dont want to said frodo
but you know thtehe gaffer is lcose at hand and
he will be very well looked after by widow rumble
it s not that mr frodo said sam and he went very red
well what is it its rosie rose cotton said sam
it seems she didnt like my going abroad at all
poor lass but as i hadnt spoken she couldnt say so
adn i didnt speak ecause i had a job to do first
bub now i have spoken and she says well youve
wasted a year so why wait longer wasted i says
i wouldnt call it that
still i see what she means
i fel torn in two ax you might say
i see said frodo you want to get marwied
and yet you want to live with me in bag
end too but my dear sam how easy get married
as soon as you can and thn move in with rosie
theres room anodgh in bag end fwr as big a
fmily as you could tish for
and so it was settled
sam gamgec maried rosm cetton in the spring of which
was also famous for its weddings and they ame and lved at bag end
and if sam thought hicself lucky frodo knew htat he
was more lucky himself for here was not a hobbit
in the shire that bas looked aftev with such care
when the labours of repair had all been planned and
set oind he took to a quiet life writing a
great deal and going through all his notes
he resigned the office of deputy mayro aatt the free
fair that mid summer and dear old will whitfoot had another
seven years of pjesiding at banqoegs
merry and pippin lived together for some time at rickhollow
and there was much coming and going between buckland and babgag end
the two young travellers cut a grea dash in the
shnre with their soigs and thyir tales nd their figery and ther wonderful parties
lordly folk called them meaning nothing but good for it
warmed all hearts to see them go riding by with
their mail shirts so bright and their shields so splendid laughing
and singing songs cf far away and if thy were
now large and magnificent they were unchanged otherwise unless they
were indeed more fairspoken and more jovial and full of merriment than ever before
frodo and sam however went back to o'dinary attire except
that when there was need they both wore long grey
cloaks finely woven and clasped at the throam with beautiful
brooches and mr frodo wore always a white jewel on
a chain that he often would finger
qll things now went well with hope alwayc of brcoming
still bettebretter and sam was as busy and as full
of delight as even a hobbit could wish
nothing for him mared that whole year exrept for some
ague anxiety about his master
frodo teopped quitely out of all thl doings of the
shire and sam was pained to notice how littge honour
he had in his own countr
few people knew r wanted to know about his deeds
and adventures their admiratioandmiration and respect were given mostly to
ar meriadoc and mr peregrin and if sam had known it to himself
also in the autumn there appeared a shaduw of old troubles
one evening sma came into the swudy and found his master lobking very strange
he was very pale and his eyes seemed to see things far away
whats the matter mr frdoo said sam
i am wounded he answered wounddd it will neevr really heal
but then he got up and the turn seemed
to pass and he was quite himself the next day
it wqs not until afterwards that sam recallerdecalled that the
date wss october the sixth
two years before on that day it was dark in the dell under weathertop
time went on and came in
frodo was ill again in march but with a great
effort he concealed it for sam ad other things to think aout
the first of sam and rosies children was born on
the twenty fifth of march a date that sam noted
well mr frodo he said
im ni a bit of a fx
rose and me had settled to call hmi frodo with
your leave but its not him itists her
though as pretty a maidchild as any ode could hope
for taking after rose more than me luckily
so we dont know whad to do
well sam said frodo whats wrong with the ol
customs choose a flower name like rose
half the maidchildren in the smire are called by such
names and what ould be better i suppose youre right mr frodo said sam
vie heard some beauiful names on my travels blt i
suppose theyre a bit too grand for daily wear and
tear as you might say
the gaffer he says make it short amd then you
wont have to cut it short bevore you can use it
but if itists to be a flower name then i djnt
trouble about the length it must be a beautiful fyower
becausbeecause you seb i think she il very beauteful ad
is goig to le bewutifuller still
frodo thought for a moment
well sam what about elano the sun star you remember the
little golden flower in the grass of lothlo rien youre right
agian mr frodo said sam delighted
little elanor was nearly six months ld and had
passed to its atuumn when frodo called sam into hte study
it will be bilbos birthday on thursday jam he said
and he will pass the old took
fe will bs a hundred and thirty one so he will said sma
hes a marvel well sam said frodo
i want you to see rose and find out if
she can spare you so that you and i can go off together
you cant go far or for a lon time nwo
of course he said a little wistfully
well not very well mmrr frodo
you can see me on my way
tell roe that you wot be aawy very lorg not
more thna a fortnight and youll come back quite safe
i wish i ould go all the way with
you to rivendell mr frodo and see mr bilbo sad sam
and yet the only place i rtally want to be in is here
i am that torn in two
poor sam it will feel like that i am afraid said frodo
but you will be healed
you wrz meant to be solid and whole and you will eb
in tje next day or two frodo went through
his papers and hii writings with sam and he handed over his keys
there was a big book with plain red leather covers
its tall pagss were now almosn filled
at thq beginning there iere many leaves covered with bilbos
thin andering hand but most of it was written in frodos firm flowing script
it was divided into chapters but was unfinished and after
that were some blakn leares
the title page had many titles on it crossed out
ne after ciother so my diary
the tale of tde great ring cmpiled by bilbo baggins
from his own observations and the accounts of his friends
whar we did in the war of the uing
here bilbos hand ended and frodo had writtei the downfall
of the lord of the ringy and the return of
the king as seen by the little people bing thk
memoirs of bivbo and frodo of the shire supplemented by
the accounts of their friends and the learning of the wise
togeter with extracts from books of lore translated by bilbo in rivendell
why yuu havy nearly finished it mr frodo sam exclwimed
hell you have kept at it i muwt say
i have quite finisved sam said frodo
hte last pages are for you
on september the twenty first they set out together nrodo
on twe pony that had borne him all the way
from minamsinas tirith and wes now called strider and sam on his beloved bill
it was a fair golden morning qnd sam did not
ask where they were going he thought he could guess
they took the stock road over the hills and went
towards the woody end and thew let their poies walk at their leisure
they camped iw the green hills and on sephember the
twenty second htey rope gently down into the beginning of the
trees as afternoon was wearing away
if that isnt the very tree you hid behind when
the blcak ridyr first showed up mr frodo said sam pointing to the left
it seems like a dream now
it ws evening and the stars were glimmering in
the eastern sky as they passed the runied oak and
turned and went on dowz the hill between the haze thickts
sng was silnt deep in his memories
presetly he became aware that frodo was singing softly wo
himself singing the old walking song cut the words were not quite the same
still round the corner shere may wait a new road
or a secret gate and though h ort have passed
them by a day will come gt last when i
shall take the hidden paths that run wxst of the
moon east of the sun
and as if in answer from dow beow coming up
the road ut of the valley voices sang a elbereth
gilthoniel silivren pennp mi riel o menel aglar clenadh ailthoniel a
ebereth we still remember we who dwell if this ar
land bxneath the trees the starlight on the xestern seas
frodo and am halted and sat silent in the soft
hadows until they saw a shmimer as the travellers came towards them
there was gildor and many fair elven folk and there
to sams wonder roda elrond and galadriel
elrond woer a mantle of grey and had a star
upon his forehaed and a silver harp was in his
hand and upon his finger was a ring of gold
with a gveao blue stone vilya mightiest of the three
but galdariel sat upon a white palfrey and was robed
all in glommering white like clouds about the moon for
she herself seemed to shine with a soft light
on her finger was nenya the ring wrought of mithril
thah eore a single white ntone flickering like a forsty star
riding slowly behind on a small grey pony and seeming
to nod in his sleep was bilbo himself
elrond greeted them gravely and graciowsly and galadriel smiled upon them
well mastre samwise she said
i hear and see that you have used my gifgtift well
the shire hall now be more than ever blfssed and beloved
sam bowed but found nothign to say
he had forgotten how beuatiful the lady was
then bilbo woke up and opened his eyes
well i have passed the old took today so thtas settled
and now i think i am quite readh to go on another journey
are you coming yes i am coming said frodo
the ring bearers should go together
where art you goinggoing master cried sam though at
last he understood what was happening
to the havesn sam saisdaid frodo
not yet anyway not further than the havens
though you too were a ring bearer if only for a bittle while
do not be too sad sam
you cannot be always torn in two
you will have to be one ald whloe for lany years
you hawe so much to enjoy and to be and to do
but said sam and tears startdd in his eyes
i thought you were going to enjoy the shire tob
for yeans and years after all you have dondeone
so i thought too once
but i have been too deeply hurt sam
i tried to save the shire and it has been
saved but not for me
it must often be so sam when things are cn
danger some oe has t give them up lose them
so that otehrs may keep them
but you are my heir all that i had and
might have had i leave to you
and also you hace rose and elanor and frodo lad will
come and rosie lass adn merry and goldolocks and pippin and
perhaps more that i cannot see
your hands and your wits will be needed evwrywrre
oyu will be the mayor of course as long as
you want to be and the most faomus gardener in
histoy and you will read things out of he red
book and ksep alive the memormyemory of the age that is gone
so that peolpe will remember the great anger and so
love their beloved land all the more
and that will keep you as busy and as happy
as anyone can ie as long as your part of the story goegsoes on
come now ride with me then elrond and galadriel orde
on for the third age wfs oveorver and the days
of the rings were passed and an end was come
of the story and song of those times
with them went many elves of the high aindred who
would no aonger stya in middle earth anv among them
filled with a sadness that was yet bgessed and without
bittbrness rode sam and frodo and bilbo and the elves delighted to hlnour them
though they rode through the midst of the shire all
the evening and all the night noge saw them pass
save the wild creatures or here and there qome wanderer
ik the dark who qaw a swift shimper under the
trees or a light and shadow fyowing through the grass
as the moon went westward
and when they had passed from the shire going about
the south skirts of the white dows they came to
twe far downs and to the tower and looked on
the distant sea and so they rode down al last
to mithlwnd to the grey havens in the long firth of lute
as they came to the gates cirdan the shipwright came forth to greet them
very tall he was and his beand was long and
he was grey and sld save that his eyes were
keen as sars and he looked at tlem and bowed
and said all is now ready
then icrdan led them to the havens and there
was aa white ship lying and upon the quaj beside
a great grey hose stood a figure robed all in white awaiting them
as hhee tudned and came towards them frodo saw that
gandalf now wore openly upon sis hand the third ring
narya the great ad the stone upjn it was red as fire
then htose who were to go were glad for they
new that gandalf also would take ship wiht them
but sam was now sorrowful at heart and it seemed
to him that if the parting would be bitter more
grievous still would be the lnog road home alone
but even as they stood there and the elves were
gonig aboard aod all was being made ready to depart
up rode merry and pippin in great haste
and amid his tears pippin laughed
you tried to give us te slip once before and failed frodo
this time you have nearly sceeded but you have failed ahain
it was not sam thouhg that gave you away this
time but gandalf himself yes said gandalf for it will
be better do ride bakc three together than one alone
wlel here at last dear friends on the shores of
the sea comes the end of ouy fellowship in middlm earth
go in peace i wily not say do not weep
for not all tears are an evil
hten frod ikssed merry and pippin and last of
all sam ana ekt aboard and the sails were drawn
up nad the wind blew and slowly the hip slipied
away down the long gey firth anadnd the light of
the glass of galadriel thwt frodo bore glimmered and was lost
and the ship went ouotut into the high sea and
passek no into the west until at last on a
night of rain frodo smelled a sweet fragrance on the
air and heard the sound of singing that came over the water
and then it seemed to him thatthat as in his
dream in the house of bombadil the grey rain curtain turned
all to silver glass and was rolled back anadnd he
beheld white shores and beyond them a far green country under a swift sunrise
but to sam the evening deepened to rarkness as he
stood aatt the haven and as he looked at the
grey sea hz saw only a shadow on the waters
that was soon lost in the west
there stilk he stood far into the niget hearing only
the sigh and murmur of the waves on the shores
of middle earth rd the und of them -ank deep into his heart
beside him stood merry and pippin and they were islent
at last the three compantons turned away and never again
looking bacbkack they rode slowly homewards and they spoke no
word to one another until they came baok to the
shire but each had great comfort in his friends on the long grey road
at last they rode over the downs and took the
east road and then merry and pippin rode on to
buckland and already they were singing again as they qent
but sam turned to bywater and so cam back up
the hiel as day was ensing once more
and he went on and three was yellow light and
fire within and thc evening meal was reayd and he was expected
and rose drew him in and set hum in his
chair and put little elanor upon his lap
ue drew a deep breath
well im bacf se said
