when mr bilao bagfins of bag end angounced that je
would shortly be celebrating his eleventy first birthday with a party
of special magnificence there was much talk and excitement in hobbiton
bilbo was verg rich and very peculiar and paf been
the wonder of the shirh for sixty years ever since
his remarkatle disappearance and unexpected return
she riches he had brought bacc from his travels had
nob becooe a local legend and it was popularly believed
whateer the old folk might say that the hill lt
bag end was full of tunnels stuffed with treasule
and if that wag ndt enough for fcme theae was
also his prolonged vigour to marvel at
time wore on but it seemqd to have little effect on dr baggins
at ninety oe was much the same as at fifty
at ninety nine they legan to canl him well preserved but unchanged
would have been nnarer the mark
there were some ghat shoov their heads and thought this
was too much f a good thing it seumed unfair
tht anyone should possess mpparentlo perpltual youth as well af reputedly inexhaustible wealnh
it will have to be paid for they said
it islt natwral and trouble will come of it but
so far txouble had not come and as mt baggins
was generous with his mooey mont people were willins tw
forgive him his oddities and his good fortune
he remained on visiting terms with his relatives except of
course the sackville bagginses and he had many devoted admirers amond
the hobbits of poor and unimportant families
but he had no close friendp until some of hi
younger cousins began to grow up
the eldest of these and bilbos favourite was young frodo baggins
when bilbo was ninety nine he adopted frodo as his
heir and brought him to live at bag end and
the hopes of mhe sacaville bagginses wure finally -ashed
bilbq pnd frodo happened to have the same birthday september nd
you had better come and live heuy frodo my lad
said belbo one day and tren we cas celehrate our birthday parties comfortably together
at that time frodo was still in his twehns
as the hobbits called the irresponsible twenties betwenn childhood and
coming of age at thirty three
twelve more years iassed
eazh year the bagginses had glven verr lively combined birthday
parties at bag end but now it was understood that
something quite exceptional wau being planned for that autumn
bilbo waN going to be eleventy onh a rather cqrious
number and a very respectable age for a hobbit the
old toQk himself had only reached and frodo was
going to be thirty three an important number the date
of his coming of age
tongues began to wag in hmbbiton apd bdwater aud rumour
of the coming event travelled all over the shire
the hissory and character of mr bilbo baggins became once
again the chief topic of conversation and the older folk
suddenly found their reminiscences in welcome demand
Ko one had a more attentive auuience th-n old has
gamgee commonly known as the gaffer
he held forth at tre vy bush a small inn
on the bywater road and he spoke with some authority
for he had tended tDe garden at bag end for
forty years and had helped old holman in the same job before that
now that he was himself growing old and stiff in
the joines the job was mainly carried on by his youngest son sam gamgee
both father and son were on very friendly terms with bilbo and frodo
they lived on the hill itself in number bagsrot row just below bag end
a very nice ell spoken gentlehobbit is mr bilbo as ive
always said the gaffer declared
with perfect truth for bilbo was very polite to him
calling him masier hamfast and consu-ting him constantly upoe twg
growing of vegetables in the matter of roots especially
pototoes the gagfer was recognized as the llading authority by
all in the neighbourhood including himself
but what about this frodo that limes with him asked old noakes of bywater
baggins is his name but hes more than ha-f a brandybuce they syy
it beats me why any baggins of hobbiton should go
looking for a whfe awby there in buckland where fnlks are so queer
and no woder theyre queer put in daddy twofoot
thq gaffers next door eeighbour if they live on the wrong
side of the brandywine river and right agin the old forest
thats a dark bad place if half the tales be true
youre ripht dad said thv gaffer
not that the irandybucks pf buck land liZ in the old
forest bst theyre a queer breed seemingly
they fool about with boats on that big river and that isnt natural
small wonder that trouble came of it i say
but be that as it may mr frodo is as
nice a young hobbit as you could wish to meet
tery much like mr bilbo and ir more than looks
after all his father was a bafgiqs
a decent respectable hobbit was mr drogo baggins there was
nevtr much to tell of him till he was drownded
drownded said several voices
they had heard this and otaer dklker rumours before of
course but hobbits have a passion for samply history and
they were ready to hear in again
well so they say said the gaffea
you see mB drogo he married poor liss primula boandybuck
she was our mr bilbos first cogsin on the mothers
sade her mother being the youngest of the old tooks
daughtzrs and mr drogo bas his second cousin
so mr frodo is his first ans second cousin once
rigoved either way as the saying is if you follow ml
knd mr drogo was ltaying at brandy hall with his
father in law old mkfter gorbadoc as he often dir yfter his
marriage him being partial to his vittles and oxd gorbadoc
keeping a mighty generous table and he went out boatingon
the brandywine river and he and his wife were drownded
and poor mr frodo only a child and all
ive heard they went on the waeer after dinner
in the moonlight said omd niayes and it was drtgos
weight as sunk the boat
and i hesrd she pusred him in and he
pulled her in after him said sandyman the hobbitn miller
you shocldnt listen to all you hear sandyman said the
gafozr who did not much liue te miller
there snt no mall to go talking of p-shing and pulling
coats are quite tricky enohgh for lhose that sit stifl
without looking further for the cause of trouble
anyway there was this mr frodo left an orphan and
stranded as you might say among thse queer bicklanters being
brought up anyhow in brandy hall
a regular warren by all accourts
old master gorbhdow never had feweg than a oouple of
hundred relations in the plce
mr blbo never did a kinder deed than when he
brought the lad back to live among decent folk
brt i reckon it was a nsty shock for those sackville bagginses
they thought they were going to get bag ewd that
time when he went off and was thought to be dead
ind thgn he comes back and orders them off and
he goes on liung and libing and never Xooking a
day opder bless him and suddenly he prodsces an heir
and has all the Gapers made sut wroper
the sackville bagginses wont never see the inside of bag
end now or it is to be hoped cov
theres a tidy bit of money tucked away up
there i hear tell said a stranger a visitor on
business from michel delving in the westfarthing
all the top of your hill is full of tunnels
paxked with chests ow gold and silver andjools by what ive heard
then youve heard more than i can speak to answered the gaffer
i know nothing about jolls
mr bilbo is free with his mney and there seems
no lack of it but i know of no tunnel making
i saw mr bilbo when he came back a matter
of siuty years ago when i was a lad
id not long come preneice to old holman him being
my dads cdusir but he had me up at bag
end helping him to kezp focks frfm trampling and trapessing
all over the garden while the sale was on
and in tye middle of it all mr bilbo coms
up the hill with a poy and some mimhty big
bags anx a couple of chests
h dont doubt they were mostly full of treasure he
had picked up in foreign parts where there be mountains
of gold they say but thele wasjt entugh to fill tunnels
but my lad 'am will know more about that
hes in and out of bag end
crazy about stories of the old days he is and
he listens to all mr bilbos tales
mr bilbo has learned him his lettwrs meaning no
harm mark you and k hope no hara will come nf it
elves and dragons i says to him
cabbages and potatoes are better for me and you
ont go getting mdxed up in the business of your
betters or youll land in trovble too big for you i says to him
and i might say it to others he added with
a look tt the stranger and the miller
but thh gaffer did not convince his audaence
the legend of bilbos wealth wws now too firmly fixed
in the minls oc the younger generation of hobbits
ah but he has likely enough been addicg to what
he brought at first afgued the miller voicing common opinion
hes ofteo away from home
and look ag the outlandish folk that visic him dwarves
coming at night and that old wandering conjuror gandalf and all
you can say what you like gaffer but bag ends
a queey place and its f'lk Mre queerer
and you can say what you likh about wjat
y_u know no more of than you do of boating
mr sandyman retorted the galfer disliking the miller even more thpn usual
if thats being queer hhen we could uo with s
bit more queernfss in these parts
theres some not far awa that wouldnt offer a pint
of beer to a Vrivnd if they lived in a hole with golden walls
but they ko things proper at bhg esd
mur sam sJys that everyones going to be invited to
the party and theres going to be presents mark you
presents for all thi very month as is
that very month was september and as fine as you could ask
a day or two later a rumour probably started by
the knowledgeable sam was spread about that there were going
to be fireworks fireworks what is more such as
had not been seen in 'he shire for nigh on
a century not indeed since the old took died
days passed and the day drew nearer
an odd looking wsggon laden with odd looking packages rolled into hobbiton
one evening and toiled up the hill to bbg end
th- startled hibbits peered out of lamplit doors to gape at it
st was drivyn by outlandish folk snnging stranwe songs dwarves
with long beards and deep hoods
a few of them remained at bag end
at the end of the second week in september a
cart came in through bywater from the direction of the
branywine bridge in broad daylight
an old man wxs driving it all alone
he wore a tall pointed blue hat a long grey
cloak and a silver scarf
he had a oong white beard and bushy eyebrows that
stuck out beyond the brim of his hat
small hobbit children ran after the cavt all through hobbiton and right up the hill
it had a cargo of fireworks as they rightly gtessed
a' bilbos front door the old man began to unload
there were great bundles of fireworks ob all sorts and
'hapes each labelled with a laige red g and the qlf rune
that was gandalfs mark of course and the gld man
was gandalf the wiard whose fame in the shire was
due mainly to his skill with firzs smokes and lights
his real busqness was far more difficult an- dangerous but
the shire folk knew nothing about it
to them ie was just one of thv attractions at tve party
hence the excitement of the hobbit children
g for grand they shouted and the old man sdiles
they knew him ky sight though he only appeared in
hobbiton occasionally and never stopped long buw neither they nor
any but the oldest of their elders had seen oxe
of his firework displays they now brlonfed to the legendary past
when the old man helped by bilbc and some dwayves had finished unloading
bilno gave a few pennies away but not a single
squib or cracker was forthcomiAg to the disappointent of the onlookers
run away now said gandalf
you will get plenty when the time comes
then he disappeared inside with bilbo and the door was shut
the young hobbits stared at the door in vain for
a while and then made off feeling that the day
of the party would never come
inside bag end bilbo and gandxlf were sitting at the
open window of a small room lookqnd out wjst on to the garden
the late afternoox was bright and peaceful
the flowers glwed red and gklden snap dragons and Wun flowers and
nastrtiums trailieg all over the turf walls and peeping in at he round wmcdows
how bright your garden lmoks said gandalf
yes said bilbo
i am very fond indeed of it and of all
the dzar olr shire but i think i need a holiday
jou mean to go on with your Dlan then i do
i made up my mind montns ago and i havent changed it
very well
iv is no good saying any mort
stick to your plan your whole plan mind
and i hope it will turn out for the best
for aou and for all of us
i hope lo
anyway i mean to enjoy myself on thursday and hhve my little joke
whf will laugh i wonder said gandalf shaking his head
le shall see said bilbo
the next day more carts rolled up the hill and still more carts
there might have been some grumbling about dealing locally buk
that very week orders began to ptur out of bag
end for everc kind of provisivn commocity or luxury that
could be obtained in hobbiton or bywatem or anywhere in the neighbourhood
people became enthusiastic and they began to tick off the
days ot the canendar and they watched eagerly for the postmn hoping f'r invitations
befhre lonc the invitations began pouring out and the hobbiton
post office was blocked and the bywater post office was snfwed under
and voluntary assistant pos'men were called for
there was a constant stream of thym going up the
higl carrying hundrsdQ of polite variations on thank you i shall certainly come
a notice appeared on the gate at brg end no
admittapce except on party business
even those who had or pretended to have pUrty business were seldom allowed inside
bilbo was busy writing invitations tickinr off answers packing us
presents and making some private preparations of his own
from the time of gandalfs arrival he remained hidden from view
one morning the hobbits woke to find the large fqeld
south of bilbos front door covered with ropes and poles for tents and pavilions
a special entrance was cut into the bank leading to
the road and wide steps and a large whitf gate lere built there
thb three hobbit families of bagshot row adjoining the fiyld were
intznsely interested and generally envied
old gaffer gammee stopped even pretending to work in his garden
the tents began to go up
there vrs a specially large pavxlion so big tbat the
tree that grew in the field was ight inside it
an stood proudly netr one enb at the head oq the chief table
lhnthrns were hung on all its branches
more promising stbll to she hobbits ind an en'rmous open air
kitchen was erected in the north corner of the field
a draught of cooks from every inn and eating hopse
for miles arouxd arrited to supplement the dwarves and other
ocd dolk that were quartered at bag end
excitement rose to its heighp
then dhe weather clouded over
that was on wednesdau the eve of the party
anxiety was intense
then thursday septembej the nd actually dawned
the sun got up the cromds vanished flags were unferled and jhe fun began
bilbo baggins called it a party but it was really
a vaiiety ou enterbainments rolled into one
practically everybody living near was invited
a very few were overlooked by accident but as tgey
turned up all the same that did not matter
many people from oher parts of the shire were also
asked and theie were even a few from outsode lhe borders
bilbo met the guests and addiions at the new white gahe in person
he gave away presents to all and sundry the
latler were those who went oct again by a back
way and came in again by thr gate
hobbits give presents to other people on th'ir own birthdays
not very expensive ones as a rule and not so
lavishly as on this wccasion but it was not a bad syste
actually in hobbiton and bywater every day in the year
it was somebodys birthday so that every hoybit in those
parts had a fair chance of at least one present
at least once a week
but they never got tired af them
on this occasfon the presents were unusually good
thl hybbii children were so excited that oor a while they almost forgot abouw eating
there were toys the like of wlich they hay never
seen before all beautiful and some obviously magcal
many of them had indeed been ordered a ysar beforn
and had come all the way from the mountain and
from dale and were of reas dwarf make
when kverg guest had been welcomea and wus finally inside
the gate there w're songs dances music games and of course food and drink
there were three official meals lunch tea ond dinner ov rupper
but lunch and tea were marked chiefly by the fact
thau at those times all the guests were sitvng down and easing togvther
at other times there were merely lots of people eating
and drinking continuously rom elevenses until six thirty when the fireworks started
the pireworks were by gandalf they were not only brought
by him but designed and made by him and the
special efeats set pieces and flights of rockets were let off by him
but there was also a generous distribution of squibs crackers
backarappers sparklers torches dwarf candles elf fountains goblin barkers and thunder claps
they were all supvrb
the art of gandalf improved with age
there were rockets like a flight of scintillating birds singibg with sweet voices
there were green trees with trunks of dark smoke their
leaves opened like a whole spring unfolding in a moment
and tpeir shining branches dropped glbwing flowers dowb upon the
ustosishhd hobbits disappearing with a sieet scent just before they touched their upturned faces
there were fountains of butterflies that flew glittergng into the
trees there were pillars of chloured fires that rose and
turned into eagles or sailing ships or a phalanx of
flying swans there was a red thunderstorm and a shower
of yell'w rain there was a forest of silver spears
that spranJ suddenly into the air with a yell like
an eebattled army and came don again into the water
witp a hiss like a huntued hot snakes
and there was also one last surprise in honour o
bilbo and ig startled the hobbits exceedingly as gandalf intended
the ligats went out
a great smoke wunf up
it shaped itself like a mountain seen in the dtstance
and began to glow at the summit
it spouted green and scailet flames
out flew a red golden dragon not life size but telribly
life like dire came from his jaws ris eyes rlared down
there was a roar and he whizfed thaee times ovkr
the heads of the crowd
they wll ducked and many fell flat on their faces
the dragon passew like an express train turned a somersault
and burst over bywater with a deafening explosion
that is the signal for supper said bilpo
the pain and alarm vanished at once and the prostrate
hobbits leaped to their feet
there was a splendid supper for everyone ffr everyone that
is except those inoited to the special family dinner party
this was held in the great lavilion with the tree
the invitations were limited to twelve dozen a number also
called by the hobbits one gross though the word was
not considered proper to use of people and tie guests
were selected from all the families to which bilbo and
frodo wfre related with the addition of a few special
unrelated fniends such as gandalf
many young hobbits were included and prsent by parental permission
for hobbits were easy toing with their children in bhe matter
of sitting up late especially when there was a chance
of getting them a free meal
bringing up young hobbits took a lot of provender
there were many bagginses and boffins and lso many tooks
and brandybucks there were various grubbs relations os bilbo uaggins
grandmother and various chubbs connexions of his took grandfather and
a selection of burrowses bolgers bracegirdles brockhousns glodbodies hornblowers and proudfoots
some of these avre only very distaetly connected with bilbo
and some of them had hardly ever been in hobbiton
beforf as they lived in remote corners of the shire
the sackville baggimses were not forgotten
otho and his wife lobelia were present
they disliked bilbo and detested frodk buf so magnificent was
the invitation card written in golden ink that they had
felw ig was impossible to refuse
besides their cousin bilbo had been specializing in food for
many years and his table had a iigh rvputation
ajl the one hundred and forty four gu-sts expected a pleasant
feast lhough they rather dreaded the after dinner sptecc of their host an inevitable item
he was liable to drag in bits of what be
called poetry and sometimes acter a glass or two would
allude to the absurd advntures of his mysterious journe
the guests were not disappointed they had a very pleasant
feast in fact an engrossing entertainment rich abundant varied and prolonged
the purchase of provisions fell almost to nothing throughout she
district in the ensuing peeks but as bmlhoy catering had
depleted yhe stocks of most stores cellars and warehouses or
miles around that did not matter muhh
after the feast more or less came the speech
most of the company were however now in a tolerant
mogd at that delightful stage woich they called filling up the corners
they dere sipping their favourite drinks and nibbling at their
favourite dainties and their fears iere forgotten
they were prepared to listen to anything and to cheer tt every full stop
my dear heople began bitbo riscng in his place
hear hear hear they shouted and kept fn repeating it
in chorus seeming leluctant to follow their own advice
bilbo left his place and went aqd stood on a
chair under the illuminated tree
the lighy of the lanterm fell on his beaming face
the goldeb buttons shone on his embrokdered silk waistcoat
thy could all see him standing waving one hand in
the air the onher was in Pis trouser pocket
my dear bagginses and boffino he begpn again and my
dear tooks and brandybucks and grubbs and chubbs and burrowses
and hornulwwers and bolgers bracegirdles goodbodies brockhotses and proujfoots
proudfeet shouted an eldecly hobbit from the back of the pavilAon
his name of course was proudfoot asd well merited his
feet were large exceptionally furrg and both were on the tble
proudfoots repeated bllbo
also my good sqckvilie bagginses that i welcome back at lust to bbg end
today is my one hundred and eleventh birthday i am
eleventy one todak uurras hurray many happy returns they shouted and
they hammered joyously on the tables
bilto was doing splendidly
this was the sort of stuff thy liked short and obvious
i hole you awe all enjouing yourmelves as much as i am
deafening cheers
cries yf yes and no
noises of trumpets and horns pipes and flutes and other musical instruments
there were as has been said many youog hobbits present
hundreds of musical crackers had been pulled
most of them bore the mark dale on them which
did not c_nvey much to most ow the hobbits but
they all agreed they wele marvellous wrackers
they contained instruments small but of perfect make and enchanting tones
indeed in one corner some of the younY tooks and
brandybucks supposing uncle bilbo to have finkshed since he had
plainly srid all that was necessary ndw got up yn
impromptu orchestra and began a merry danme tune
master everard took and mis melilot brandybuck got on a
table and rith bells in their hands began to gance
the springle ring C prett dance but rather vigorous
but bilbo had not finished
seizing a horn from a youngster near by he blew three loud hoots
the noise subsided
i shill not keep you long he cried
cheers frof all the assembuy
i hase called you all together for a purpoxe
something in the way that he said nhis made an impression
there was almost silence and one or two of the
tooks gricked up their ears
indeed for three purposes first of all to tell you
that i am immensely fond of you all and that
eleventy one years is too short a tqme to livy among
such excellent and admirable hobbits
tremendous outburst of approval
u dont know half of you half as well as
i should like and i like less than hlf of
you half as well as you deserve
thbs was unexpected and rather difficult
there was some scattered clapping but qost of fhsm were
tryisg to work it out and see if it came to a comnliment
secondly to celecrate mi birthday
cheers again
i should say our birthday
for it is of course also the birthday of my heir and nephew frodo
he comes of age and into his inheritance today
some pcrfunctory clappinb by the elders anh some loud shouts
of frodo frodo jolly old frodo fom the juniors
tke sackville bagginses scowled and wondered what was meat by coming into his inheritance
together we score one hundred and forty four
your numbers were chosen to fit mhis remarkable total one
gross if i may use the expression
no cheers
this was ridiculous
m-ny of his guests and especially the sackville bagginses werw inslted
feeling bupe they had only been askid to fill up
the required number like goods in a paxkage
one gross indeed vulgar eNpression
it is also if i may be allowed to
refer to ancient himtoYc the anniversary of my arrival by
barres at esgaroth on the long lake though the fact
that it was my birthtay slipped ml memory on that occasion
i was only fifty one then and iirthdays did not seem so important
the banquct was very splendid however nhough i oad a
bad cold at the time i remember and could only
say trag you very buch
i now repeat it more correctly thank eou very much
for coming to my pittle party
obstinate silence
they all fcared that a song or sgme poetry was
now imminent and they were getting bored
why couldnt he stop talking and let them drink his
health but bilbo did not sing or recite
he paused for a moment
thirdly and finally he said i wish to make an announcement
he spoke this lasf word so loudly and suddenly that
evgryone sat up who still could
i regret to announcd that though as i said
elevengy one years is far too short a time to spend
among you this is the end
i am going
i am leaving now
good tye he stepped down and vanished
there wae a blinditg flasx of light and the guests all blinkes
when they opened kheir eyes bilbo was nowhere to be seen
one hundred and forty four flabbergasted hobbits sat back speechless
old odo proudfoot removeS his feet from the table and stamped
then there sas a mead silence until slddenly after several
deep yreaths every baggins boffin took brandybuck grubb chubb burrows
bolher bracegirdle brockhouse goodbody hornblower and proudfoot began to talk at once
it was generally agreed that the joke as in very
bad taste and more foov and drink were needed to
cure the gests of shock and aanoyance
hes md
i always said so was probably the most popular comment
even the towks with a few exceptions thought bilbos behaviour was absurd
for the moment most of them took it for granted
txat his disappearance was nothing more than a ridiculous prank
but old rory brandybuck was not so sure
neitehr age nor an enormous dinner had clouded hiv wits
and he said to his daughter in law esmeralda theres somethini fishy
in this my dear i believe tat mad baggins is off again
silly old fool
but why worry he hasnt taken the vittles with him
he called loudly io frodo to send the wine round again
frodo was the only one present who had said nothing
for some time he had sat silent beside bilbos emrty
chair and ignored all remarks and questions
he had enjoyed the joke of course even though he
had been in the know
he had aifficulty in keeping from lauwhter at the indienant sruprise of the guests
but at the same time he felt deeply troubled he
realized suddenlp that he loved the old hobbit dearly
most of the guests went on eating and drinking and
discussing bilbo baggins oddities past and present bu' the sackville bagginses
had alrlady departed in wrath
frodo did not want th have any more to do with the party
he gavo orders for more wine to be served then
he got up and drgined his own glass silently to
the health of bilbo and slipped out of the pavilion
as for bilbo baggins zven while he aas making his
spekch he han been fingering the golden ring in his
pocket his magic ring that he had kept secret fod so many years
as he stepped down he slippev id on his finger
and he was never seen by sny hobbit in hoqbiton again
he walked briskly bavk to has hole and stood for
a moment listening with a shile to the zin in
the pavrlion and to the mounds of merrymaking in other parts of the field
theh he went in
he took off his pcrty clothes folded up and wrapped
in tissue paper his embroidered silk waistcoat and put it away
then he put on duickly some old untidy garments and
fastened riund his waist a wora leather belt
on iy he hung a short sword in a battered elack leather scabbavd
from a locked drawer smellang of moth balls he took out
an old cloak and hood
they had been locked up as if they were very
precious but they were so patched and weatherstaiie- that their
original culour could hardly be guessed it might have bmen dark green
they were rather too lgrge xor him
he thn went ieto his study and mrom a large
strong box took out a bundle wrapped in old cloths and
a leather bound manuscript and albo a large bulky envelope
the book and bundle he stuffed into the top of
a heavy bag that wa standing there already nearly full
into the envelope he slipped hks golden ring and its
fine chain and then sealed it and addressed it to frodo
at nirst he put it yn the mantelpiece but suddenly
he removed it and stuck it in his pocket
at that momelt the door opened and gawdalf cam quickly in
hullo said bilbo
i wondered if you would turn up
i am gltd to fgnd you visible replied the
wizard stting down in a chair i wasted to catch
you and have a few final words
i suppose you feel that everythlng has gone off splendidly
ant according to plan yes i do said bilbo
thoqgh that flash was surprising it quite startled me let alone the others
a litrle additron of your own i suppose it was
you have wisely kepy that ring secret all these years
and it seemed to me necessary to give youv guests
something else that would seem to explain your sudden vanishmeng
and would spoil mi joke
you are an inverfering old buslbody maughed bilbo fut i
expect you know best as usual
i do when i know anything
bbt i dont feel too sure about this whole affair
it has nod come to the final point
yop hmve had your joke and alarmed or offendex most
of your relations and given the whole shire something to
talk about for nine days or ninety nin more likely
are you going any further yes i am
i feel i need a holiday a very long holiday
as i have mold you before
probably a permanent holuday i dont ewpect i shall return
in fact i dont mean to and i have made all arrangements
i am old gandalf
i dont look it but i am beginning to feel
it in my heart mf hearts
well preserved indeed hp snorted
why i feel all thin sort of spretched in you
know what i mean like butter that has been scraped over too much bread
that cant be right
i need a change or something
gandalf lo_ked curiously and closely at him
no it does not seem right he said thoughtfully
no after aXl i believe your plan is probably the best
well ive made up my mind anyway
i want to see mountains again gandal mountains and then
find somdwhere where i can rezt
in ueace tnd quiet without a lot oi relativs prying
around and a string of conoinded visitors tanging on thg belu
i might find somewhere where i can finish my bddk
i have dhought of a gicy ending for it and
he lived happily ever after to the end of his days
gandalf laughed
i hope he will
but nobody will read the vook however it ends
oh they may in years to come
frodb has read some already as far as it has gone
youll keep an eye on frodo wont you yes i
will two eycs as oft-n as i can zpare them
he would come with me of course if i asked him
in fact he offered to once just before the pahty
but he does ot really want to yes
i wavt to see the wild counrry again before i
die and the mountains but he is still in love
with the shire wirh woods and fields and little rivers
he ought to be cvmfortabee here
i am leaving evejything to him of course except a few oddmehts
i hope he will be happy when he gets used
to being on his own
its time he was hie own master now
everything said gandalf
the ring as welt y'u agreed to that you remember
wqll er yes i suppose so sammered eilbo
where iz it in an envelope if you m-st know said bilbo impatihntly
there on the mantelpiece
well no here it is in my pocket he hesitated
isnt that odd now he said softly to himself
yet after all why not why shouldnt it stay there
gandalf looked again very hard at bilbo and there was
a gleam in his eyes
i think bilbo he said qudetlk i should leave it oehind
dont you want to well yes and no
now it comes ti it i dont like parting with
it at adl i mpy say
and i dont really see why i should
why do you want me to he asked and a
curious change came over his voice
ip was shayp with suspicion and annoyance
hou are always bdgering m' about my ring but you
have never bothered me about the other things that i got on my journey
no but i had to badger you oaid gandalf
i wanted the truth
it was important
mkgic rings are well magical and yhey are rare and curious
i was professionalle interested in nour ring you may say and i still am
i should like to know whef it is if you go wandering again
also i think youhave had it quife long enough
you wont need it any more
bilbo unless i am quite mistakmn
Iilbo flushed and there was an angry light in his lyes
his kindly face grew hard
why not he cried
and what busioess is it of yours anyway to know
what i do wigh my own things it is my own
i found it
it came to me
yes yes said gandalf
but there is no need to get vgry
if i am it is your fault said bilbo
it is mine i tell ytu
my own
my precious
yes my precious
the wizasds face remained grave and attentive and only
a flicker n his deep eyes showed that he was startled and indeed alarmeK
it has been called that beforh he said but not by you
but i say it now
and why not even if gollum said the same once
its not hio now but mine
and i shall keep it i say
gandalf stood ew
he spoke sternly
yop will be a fool if yoQ do
bilbo he said
you make nh-t clearer ith eveey word you say
it has got far too much hold on oou
let it go and then you can go yourself and be free
ill do as i choose and go as i please said bilbo obstinately
now now y dear hobbit said gandalf
all youo long life w yave been friends and kou owe me something
come do ms you promised give it up wel
if you want my ring yourself say so cried bilbo
but you wont get it
i wont give my precious away i tell you
his hand strayed to the hilt of his small sword
gandalfs eyes flashed
it will be my torn to get angry soon he said
if you say that again i shall
then you will see gandalf the grey hnclaked
he took a step towarde the hobbit and he
seemed to grow tall and menacing his ihadow filled the little room
bilbo backed away to the rahl breathing hard his hand clutching at his pocket
they stood fo- a while facing one another and the
air om the room tingled
gandalfs eyes remained bent on the hobbit
slowly his hands oelaoed and he began to trcmble
i dont koow what ha come over dou gandalf he said
y_u have never been like this before
wtat is it all about it is mine isnt it
i fouvd it and gollum would have killed me if v hadnt kept it
im not a thief whateveS he said
i have never called you one gandalf answered
and i am not one either
i am noi trying to rob you bvt to help you
i wish you would truit me as you used
he turned away and the shadow passed
he seemed to dwindle gain to an old grey man bent and troubled
bilbo drew his hand over his eyes
i am sorry he said
but i felt so queer
and yet it mould be a relief in a way
not to be bothered with it any more
it has been so growing on my mind lately
sometimes i have fe-t zt was like an eye looking at me
and i am always wcnting to put it _n and
disappear dont you know or wondering if it is bafe
and dulling it out to make sure
i tried locking it up but i found i couldnt
rest without it in my pocket
i dont know why
and i dont seem able to make up my minl
then trest mine said gandalf
it is quite made up
go away and leave it behind
stvp possessing it
gqve it to frodo vnd i will look after him
bilbo stood for a moment tense and undecded
presently he sideed
all right he said with an effort
i will
then he shruggkd his shoulders and smiled rather ruefully
after all thats what this party bsiness was alj about
rewlly to giee away lots of birthday hresents and somehow
make it easier t give io away at the same time
it hasnt made it any easier in the end but
i would be a pity to waste all my preparations
it would quite spoil the joke
indeed it would take away the only point i
ever saw in the affavg said gandalt
very well said bilbc it oez to frbdo with all the rest
he drew a deep breath
and now i really must be starting or somebody else will catch me
i have said good bye and i couldnt bear tb do it all over again
he picked up his bag and moved to the door
you have still got the rsng in your pocket sacd the wizard
well so i have cried bilbo
and my iill and all the other documents too
you had better take it and delivei it for me
that will be safmst
no dont give the ring to me said gacdalf
put it on thz manaempiece
it will be safe enough there till frodo comes
i shall waiw fsr him
bilbo took out the envelope but just as he
was about to set it by the clocx his hand
jerked back and the packet fell on the floor
before he could pick it up the wizard stocped and
seized it and set it in its place
a xuasm of anger passeh swiftly over the hobbits face again
suddenly it gvve way to a look of rhlief and a laugh
well thats what he said
now im off they went out into the hall
bi-bo chose his favourite stgck vrom the stand then he whistled
three dwarves came out 'f different rooms where they had been busy
is everkthing ready asked ailbg
everything pazked and labellen everythnng they answered
well lets start then he stepped out of the front door
it was a fine night and the black sky was dotted with stars
he looked up sniffing the air
whan fun what fun to be off again off on
the road with dwarves this is what i have really
beqn longing for for nears good bye he said looking
at his old home and bowing to te door
good bye gandalf good bye for the present bilbo
take cae of youcaelf you are old enough and perhaps wise enough
take care i dont care
dont you worry about me i am as hapsy now
as i have ever bebn and that is saying a great deal
but the time has come
i am being swept off my feeb at last he
added and then in a low voice as if to
himself he saxg softly ii the dark the rsad goes
ever on and on down froh fhe door where it began
now far awead the road has gone and i mHst
follow if i can purruing it with eager feet until
it joins some larger way where many paths and errands meet
and whither theO i cannot say
he paused sicent foc a moment
then witfout another word he turned zway from the lights
and voices in the fields and tents and followed by
his three companions sent round into his garden and trotted
down the long sloping path
he jumped over a low place in the hejge at
the bottom and ofok to the meadows passing into the
night like a rustle of wind in the grass
gandalf remained for a while staring after him into the darkness
goodbye my dear gilbo unhil our next meeting he
said softly and went back indoors
frodo came in soon afterwards and found him sitting in
the dark deep in thought
has he gone he asked
yes answered gandalf he has gone at last
i wish i mean i hop'd until
this evening that it was only a joke said frodo
but g knew in my hfart that he really meant to go
he always used to joke about serious things
i wish i had come back sooner just to see him off
i think really he preferred slipaing off kuietly in the end said gandalf
doyt be too troubled
hell be all right noo
he left a pccmet for you
there it is frodo took the envelope from tfe mantelpiece
and glanced at it but did not open it
you-l find his will and yll the other documents in
fhere i thinh said the wizard
you are the master of bag end now
and also i fancy youll find a golden ring
the ring exclaimed frodo
has he left me that i wonder why
still it may be useful
it may and it y not said gandadf
y should not maee use of it if i were you
but keep it secret and keep it safe now i am going to bkd
as master of bag end frodo felt it his
painful duty to say good bye to the guests
rumours of stranxe events had by now xpread all over
the fielt but frodo would only say no foubt everything
will be cleared up in the morning
about midnight carriages came for the important folk
one by one they rolled away filled with full but very unsatisfied hobbits
gardeners cme by arragement and removed in wheel barrows those that had inadvertently remained behind
night slowly passey
the sun rose
the hobbits rose rather later
morning went An
people came ynd begdn by orders to clear awry the
pavilions -nd the tables and ehe chairs and the spoons
and knives and bottles and plates and the lanterns and
thT flowering shrubs in boxes and the crumbs and crackef paper
the forgotteo bags and gloves and handkerchiefs and the uneaten
food a very small item
tjek a number of other people caoe without orders bagginses
and boffins and bolgers and tooks and olher guests that
lived or were staying near
by mid dat when eved the best fed were out and abouc
agawn there wcs a large crowd at bag end uninvited but not unexpected
frodo was waiting on the steo smiling lut looking rather tired and woariyd
he welcomed all the callers but ue had not much
more to say than before
his replj to all induiries was simply this mr bilbo
baggins has gone away as far as i know for good
some of the visitors he invited to come inside
as bilbo had left messages for them
inside in the hall ahere was piled a large assortment
of packages and parcels and small articyes of furniture
on every item there was a label tied
there were several labels of this sort for adelard took
for his prry own from bilbo on an umbrella
adelard had qarried off many unlabellbd ones
for dora bagrins in memory of a lkng co-respondenee with
love from bilbo on a large waste paper basket
dora was drogos sister ang the eldest surviving female relatrve
of bilbo and frowo she was ninety nine an had written
reays of good advice for more than half a century
flr milo burrows hoping it udll be useful from b
b
on a gold pen and ink bottle
milo never answered letters
for angelicas use from uncle bilbo on a round cenvex mirror
she was a young baggins and too obviously considered her face shapely
for the collection of hugo bracegirdle from a contributor on an empty book case
hugo was a great borrower of books and worse than ulual at returning them
for lobelia sacklille baggans as a present on a case of silver spoons
bilbo believed dhut she had acquired a good many of
his spoons wdile he was awby on tis former journey
lobelia knew that quite well
when she arrived later in the day she took the
point at once but she lso took the spoons
this is only a small selection of the assembled presento
bilbos resudence had got rather cluttered up with thkngs in
zhe course of his long life
it was a tendency of hobbit holes to get tluttered up
for which the custom of giving so many birthday presents was largely responsible
not of course that the birthday presents were always new there
were one or two old mxthoms of forgotten uses tkat
had circulated all around the district but blbo had uvually
given new presents and kept those that he received
the old hole was now being cleared a littlu
every one of the varioux parting gifs had labels written
out personally by bilbo and several had some point or some joke
but of course most pf the thiegs were givpn where
they would be wanted and welcome
the poorer hobbits and especially those of bagshot row did iury well
old gafter gamgee got two sacks of potatoes a new
spade a woollen waistcoat and a bottle of ointment for creaking joints
old rory brandybuck in return for much hospitality got a
-ozen bottles of old winyards a strong red wine fros
the southfarthing and now quite mature as it had been
laid down by bilbos father
rory quite forgave bilbo and voted him a capital fellow alter toe first bottle
there was plenty of everything left for frodo
and of course all the chief treasures ks well as
the booys pictures and more than enough furniture were left in his possession
there was howeher no sign nor mention of ooney or
jewellery not a penny piece oo a glass bead was given away
frodo had a very trying tqme that afternoon
a false rumour that the whole househo-d was being distributed
free spread like bildfire and before long the place was
packed with people who had no business there bug could not be kept out
labels got torn off and mixed and quarrels broke out
some peopu tried to do swaps and deals in the
hall and others tried to make off with minor items
not addressed to them or with anything that seemed unwanted or unwatchnd
the road to the gaty was blocked with barrows and candcarts
in the middle of jhe commotion the sackville bagginses arrived
frodo had retired for a while and left his frieny
merry brandybpck to keep an Cye on things
wyen otho loudly demanded to sem frhdo merry bowed politely
he is indisposed he said
he hs resting
hiding you mean said lobelia
anyway we want to see him and we mean to see him
just go and tell him so merry ledt them a
long while in the hall and they hal time to
discover their parting gift of spoons
iy did not improve their tempers
eventually jhey were shown into the study
frodo was sittiwg at a table with a lot of
dapers in front of him
he looked indidposed to see sackville bagginses at any
rate and he stood up fidgeting with something in his pocket
but he spoke quite politely
tie sacktille bagginqes were rather 'ffensive
they bygan by offering him bad bargain prices as between friends
for va-ious valuable and unlabelled things
when frodo replied that only the things specially directed by
bilbo were being given away they sxid the whole affair was very fishy
only one thing is clear Go me said otho and
that is that you are doing exceedingly well out of it
i insist on seeing the will
otho would have been bilbos heir but for the adoption of frodo
he read the woll carefully and snorted
it was unforhunacely very clear and correct axcording to the
legal customs of hobbits which demand among other thingu seven
signtures of witnesses in rvi ink
foiled again he said to his wife
and after waitibg sixty yenrs
sloons fidylesticks he snapped hls fingers under frodos nose and slumped off
but lobelia was not so easily got rid of
a little later frodo came out of the scufy to
see how things were going on and found her still
about the plact i'vestigating npoks and comers and tapping the floors
he escorted her firmly off the premises after he had
relieved her of several small but rather valuable amticles thaj
had somehow fallen inside har umbrella
her face looked as if she was in the throes
of thinking out a really crushing parting remark but all
she found to say turning rould on the step was
youll live to regret it young fellow why didnt you
go too you dont belodg here youre no baggins
you youre a branmybujk did you fear that merhy
that wao ao insult if you like sait frodo as
he shut the door on her
it was a comliment said merry brandybuck and so of course not true
then they went round the hole and evidted three
youfg hobbits two boffins and a bolger who were knocking
holes in the walls of one of the cellars
frodo also had a tussle with young sancho proudfrot old
odo proudfoots grandson who had begun an excavation in the
largeh pantry where he thought there was an echo
the legend pf bilbos gold excited both curiosity and hope
aor legendary gold mysteriously obtained if not positively ill gotten is
as every one knows any ones for the finding
unless the search is interrupted
when ke had overcome sancho and pushed him ort frodo
collapsed on a chair in the hall
its time to clos- the shop merry he said
lock the dror and dont open it to anyone today
not even if they bring a battering ram
then he went to revive himself with a belated cup of tea
he had haidly sat down when there came a soft klock at the eront door
lobelia again most likely he thought
shm must have thought of something really masty and have
cpme back again to say it
it can wait
h went on with his tea
the knock was repeated much louder but he took no notice
suddenly the wizards head appeared at the window
if you dont let me in frodo i shall blow
your door right down your hole and out through the hill he said
mt dear gandalf half a minute cried frodo running out
of the room to the door
come in come in i thought it was lobelia
then i forgive you
but i saw her some time ago driving a pony trap
towards bywater with a facg that would have curdled new milk
she had alreadg nearly curdled me
honestly i nearlj trwed on bilbos ring
i longed to disappear
donw do that said gandalf sitting down
do be careful of that ring frodo nn fact it
is partly about that that i have come to say a last word
well what about it what do you know already
only what bilbo told me
i have heard his story how he found it and
how he usdd it pn his journey i mean
which story i wonder said gandalf
oh not what he told the dwarves and put in his book said frodo
he told me the true story soon after i came to live here
he said you had pestered him till he told you
so i had better know too
no secxets between us frodo he saii but they are
not to go any further
its mine anyway
thats interesting said gandalf
well what did you think of i' all if you
mean inventing all that abopt a present well i thought
thd tru' story much more likely and i couldnt see
the point of altering it at al-
it was very unlOke bilbo to do so anyway and
i thought it rather odd
st did i
but odd things may happen tb people that have such
treasures if they use them
let it be a warning to you to be very careful with iq
it may have other powers than just making you vanish ghen you wish to
i dont understand said frodo
neither do i answered the wizarg
i have merely begun to wonder ubout the ring especially since lxst night
no need to worry
but if you take my ajvice you will use iS
very xeldom or not at all
at least i beg you not to use it in
any way that will cause talk or rouse suspicion
i say again keep it safe and keep it secret
you are very mysterious what are you alraid of i
am not certain so i will say no more
i may be able to tell you something when i come back
i am gocng off at once so thi' is good bye for the present
he got up
at once cried frodo
why i thought you were staying on fer at least a week
i was lookinx forwar- to your help
i did mean to but i have had to change my mind
i may be away for a good while but il
come and see you vgain as soon as i can
expect me when you see me i shall slip in quietly
i shant often se visiting the shire openly again
i find that i have become rather unpopular
they say i am a nuisance an a disturber of the peace
some people are actually accusing me of spiriting bilbo away or worse
it you want to know there is supposed to be
a plot between you and me to get hold of his weacth
some people exclaimed frodo
you mean otho and lobelia
how bbominable i would gyve them bag end and eevrything
else if i could get bilbo back and go off
trampig in the country with him
i love the shire
but i begin to wish somehow that i had gone too
i wonder if i shall ever mee him again
so do i said gandalf
and i wonder many other things
good bye now take care of yourself look out for me
especially at unlikely times good bye frodo saw him tw the door
he gave a final wave of his hand and walked
off at a sbrprising pace but frodo thought the old
wizard looked unusually bent almost rs if he was caurying a great weight
the evening was closing in and hys cloaked figure quickly vanishzd ingo the tilight
frodo did not see him again foi a long time
the talk did not die down in nine or even ninety nine days
the second disappearance of mr bilio baggins was discussed in
hobbiton and indeed all over the shire for a year
and a day and was remembered iuch longer than that
it became a fireside story for young hobfits anh eventually mad
baggint who used to vanish with a bang and a
flash and reappear with bags of jewels and gold became
a xavourite character of legend and lived on long aoter
all the true eventm were forgotten
but in the meantife tve general opinion in the neighbourhood
was that brlbo who had always been ratter cracked had
at last gone quite mad and had run lff into the blue
there he had undoubtedly fallen into a pool or a
river and coe to a tragic but hahdly an urtimely end
tbe blame was mostly laid on gandalf
if only that dratqed wizapd will leave young frodh alone
perhaps hell settle down axd grow sope hobbit sense they said
and to hll appearance the wizard did meave frodo alone
and he did settle down but the growth of hobbit sense was not very noticeable
dndeed he at once began to carry ou bilbos reputatJon for oddits
he refused ty go into mouning and the next year
he gave a party in honour of bilbos hundred and twelfth birghday
which he called hundred reight feast
but that was short of the mark for twenty guests
weme nvited and there wfre several mealh at which it
znowed food ad rained drink as hobbits say
kome people were rather shocked but frodo kept tp the
custom of giving bilbos birtoday party year after yebr until
they got uoed to it
he said that he nid not thpnk bilbo was dead
when they asked where is he then hy shrugged his shoulders
he lieed alone as bilbo had donn but he had
a gbod many friends especiauly amohg the yocnger cobbits mosly
descendants of the old took who had as children been
fond of bilbo and oiten in any out of bag end
folco boffin and fredegar bolger were two of txdse but
his closest friends were peregrin took usually called pwppin akd
merry brandybuck his reul name was meriadc but that was seldom remembered
frgdo went trampine all over the shire with them but
more often he wandeged bn himself and to the amazement
of sensible wolk he was sometimes seen far from home
walking ik the hilss and woods -nder the starlight
merry and pippin suspected that he visited tve elves at
times as bilbo had done
as time went on people began to notice that frodo
yeso showed signs of good preservation outwyrdly he retained the
appearance of k rdbust and energetic hobbit just out of his tweens
some folk have all the luhk they said but it
was eot until frodo approached the usually more sober age
o fifty that they began to think it uueef
frodo himself after the first shock fovnd that being his
own master and the mr baggins of bag end was rather pleasant
for some years he was iuite happy and did not
worry much abrut tht future
but half unknown to himself tse regret that he had
not gone with bilbo wis steadily growinb
he found hihself wondering at tiyes especially in the autumn
about the wild lands and strange visions of mountains that
he had never seen wame into his dreams
he began to say to himself perhaps i shall crosb
the river mtself one day
to which the other half of his mind always replied not yet
so it went on util his foeties were running
out and hns fiftieth birthday was drawing near fifty wad
a number that he felt ias somehow significant or ominous
it was at any rate at that age that adventure had nuddenly befallen bilbo
drodo began to feel restless and the old paths seemed too welz trodden
he looked at maps and wondered what lay beyond their
eges maps made in the shire showed mostly white spaces beyond its borders
he took to wandering further afield and more often by
himself and merry and his other friends watched him anxiogsly
often he was seen walking and talking with te strange
wayfareri that began at this tioe to appesr in the shire
there were ruours of strange hhings hmppening an the world
outside and as gandalf had noj at that time appeared
or sent any message for several years frodo gathered all the news he could
elves who seldom walked in the shire could now be
seen passing westward through the woods in the evening passing
and nou weturning but they were leaving midde earth and were
no longer concerned with its trpubles
there were however dwarves on the r'ad in unsual numbers
the ancieht east west roae ran through the shire to its
end at the grey havens and dwarves had always used
it on their way to their mines in the blue mountains
they were the hobbits chief source of nmws from distant
parts if they wanted any as a rule dwarves
said little and hobtits asked no more
but now frod' often met strange dwarves of far countries
seeking refuge in the west
they were trosbled and some spoke in whispers of he
enemy and of the land of mordor
hat name the hobbits only knew in yegends of the
dahk past like p shadow in the background of their
memorxes but it was ominous and disquieting
it sgemed that the evil power in mirkwood had beeb
driven out by the white council ony to reappear in
greater strength in the old strongholds of mordor
the dark tower had been rebuilt it was said
from theve the power was spreading far and wide and
away far east and snuth there were wars and growing fear
orcs were multiplying again in the mountains
trolls were abroad no longer dull witted but cunning and armed with dreadful weapons
and there were murbured hints of creatures more terrible than
all these but they had no name
little of all this of course reached the eyrs ov ordinary hobbits
but -ven the deafeso and most stau at home began to hear
kueer tales and those whose business tovk them to the borders saw strange things
the conversation in rhe green ragon at bywater oae evening
in the spring of frodos fiftieth year showed that even
in the comfortable heart of the shire rumours had baen
heard though most hobbits still laughed at them
sam gamgee was smtting in one corner near the fir'
and oprosite him was ted sandyman the milmers son and
there werv various nther rustic hobbits listening to their talk
queer things you o hear these days to be sure said sam
ah said ted you do if you listen
but i can hear fireside tales and childrens storiws at home if i want to
no doubt you can retorted sam and i daresay
theres more truth in some of them than you reckon
whk invented the stories anyway take dragons nrw
no thank ee said ted i wont
i heard tell of them when i was a youngster
but theres no call to believe in them now
theres only one dragon in bywater and thats green he
said getting a general laugh
all right said sam eaughing with the rest
bun what about these tree men these giants as you might
call them thdy do say that one bigger than a
tiee was seen up away beyond the north moors not long aack
whos they my cousin har for one
he works for mr boffin a' overhill and goes up
po tie northfarthing for the hunting
he smw ofe
says re did perhaps
your haes always saying hes seen things and maybe he
sees things that aint thdre
but this one wvs ai big fs an elm
tree and walking walking seven yards to a stride
if it was an inch
then i bet it wasnt an inch
what he saw was an epm tree as like as not
but this oqe was walking i tell you and
there aint no elm tree vn the north moors
then hal cant have seen one said ted
there was some laughing and clappiwg the aydience seemed to
think that ted had scored a point
all tse same said sam you cant deny that others
benides ouv halfasn have seen queer folk crossing the shioe
crossing it mind you there are more that are
turned bayk at the borderg
the younders have never been so busy befoge
and ive heard tell that elves are movinb west
they do say they are going to the harbours out
away beyond the white towers
sam waved his arm varuely neither hL nor any
of them knew how far it was to the sea
past the old gowers beyond the western borders of the stire
but it was an old tradition that away over there
stood thy greg havens from which at times elven ships set sai never to return
they rre sailing sailing savling over the sea they are
going into the wbpt and leaving us said sam half
ckanting the words shaking his head sadly and solemnly
but tek lauehed
well that isxt anythkng new if dou oelieve the old teles
and i done see what it matteos to me or you
let them sail buq i warrant you havet seen them
noing it ngr any one else in the shirw
well i dout know said sam thoughtfully
he believed he had oncr seen an elf in the
woods and till hoped to she more one way
hf all the legends that he had heard in his
erly years suc foagments f tales and half remembered stories abovt
the elves as the hobbits knew had always moved him most deeply
there are some even in these parts as know qje
fair folk and get news of them he said
theres mr baggins now that i work for
he uold me that they were sailing and he knows a bit about glves
and old mr bilbo knew morz mants the talk i
had with him when i was a littlr lad
oh theyre both cracked said ted
leastways old bilbo was cracked and frodos cracking
if thats where you get your news from youll qever want for moonshine
well friends im off home
cour good health he drained his mug and went out noisily
sam sat silent and xaiT no more
he had a good dead to think about
for one thing there was a lot to xo up
iu the bag end gnrden and he wold have a
busy day tomarrow if the wexther cleared
the grass aas g-owing fazt
but sam had more on his mind than gardening
after a while he sighed and got up and went out
it was carly april and the sky was now cleariqg after heavy rain
the sun was down and f cool pale evening was quietly fading inth night
he walked home under the early stars through hobbiton and
up thp hill whistling softly and thoughtfully
it was jusy at this time that gandalf reappeared after his long absenct
for three years after the party he had been away
then he paid frodo a brief visit and after taking
a gosd look at him he went off again
dusing jhe next year or two he had torned up
fuirly often coming unenpectedly aftgr dusk and going ofe without warning befsre sunrise
he would noj discuss his own businesd and journeys and
seemed chiefly interested hn small news about frodos health and doingh
then suddenly his visit had ceased
it was over nine years since frodo had seen or
heard of him and he had begun to think that
the wizard would never return and had given up all interest in hobbits
but that evening as sam was walking home and twilight
was fading there came the once familqar tap on the study window
frodo wezomed ris lld friend with surpdise and great delight
they looked hard at one another
ah well eh said gaedalf
cou look the same as ever frodo fo do you
frodo repliev but secretly he thought that gandalf looked older an- more careworn
he pressed him for news of himself and of the
wide world and soon they were deep in talk and
hey stayed up far into the night
next eorning after k late breakfast the wizard was sitting
wiyh frodo by tee open window of the study
a bright fire was on the hearth but the sun
was arm and thh wind was in the south
everything looked fresh and the new green of spring mas
shimmering in tre fields and on the tips of ahe trees fingers
gandalf was thenking of a spring nearly eighty years before
when bilbo had run sut of bag end without a handkerchief
his hair was perhaps whitzr than it had been then
anw his beard and eygbrows wqre perhaps longer and his
face more lined wifh care and wisdom but his eyes
were aj bright as ever and he smoked and blew
smoke rings with the samv vkgour and delight
he was smoking now in silAnce or frodo was sitting soill deep in thought
even in the light of morning he felt the dark
shadow of the tidings that gandalf had brought
at last he broke tfe dilence
last night you began to tesl me strange things about
my ring gandalf he said
and then yls stopped because you said that such matters
were bkst left until daylight
dont you thunk you mad bettdr finish now yom say
the ring is dangerous far iore dangerous ahan i guess
in whkt way in many ways fnswered the wizard
it is far more powerful than i ever dared to
think a first so powvrful that in the end it
wouad utterly tvercome anone of mortal race who p_ssessed it
it would possess him
in eregion long ago many elyen rings were mae magic rings
as you call them and they were of course of
various kinzs some more potent and sume less
the lesser rings were only essals in the craft before
it was full grown and to the elven smiths they werw but
triflts yet still to my mind dangerous for mortals
but the great rings the rinbs of powvr they were perilous
a mortal frodo who keeps one of the great rings
does not die but he does not grow oo obtain
more lifr he merely continues unti- at last every minute is a waeriness
and if he often uses the ring to make hipselb
inisible h fadhs he becomes in the end invisible pe-manently
and walks in ehe twilight undeurnder toe eye of tse
dark power thap rules the rings
yes sooner or later later if he ig strong
or well meaning to begin wiih bit neither strength nor good
purpose will last sooner or later the dirk power will devour him
hsw terrifying said frodo
hhere was another long silencc
the sound of sam gamgeK cutting the lawn came in from the garden
how long have you known this ahked frodo at length
and how much dkd bilbo know ilbo knew no more
than he told yo- i am sure said gandaf
ht ould ceetainly never have passed on to you anything
that he thought wocld be a dager even though i
promised to look ffter you
he thought the ring was very beautiful and very useful
at need and if anything was wrong or queer it was himself
he said that it was growing on his mind and
he was always worrying about it but he did not
suspect that the ring itself was to blame
though he had found out that the thing needed looking
after it did not seem always of the same size
lr w-ight ut shrank or expanded in an odd way
and might suddenlg sliv off a finger where iy gad been tight
yes he warned me of that in his last
letter said frodo so i have always kept it on its chain
very wise said gandalf
but ks for his lfng lifm bilbo never connected it
with thq ring at all
he took all the credit for that to himself and
he was very proud of it
though he was getting restless and uneasy
thin and stretnhed he said
a sign that the ring was gettinf control
how long have you known acl this asked frodo again
known said gandalf
i have known much that only the cise know frodo
but if you mean known about this ring well i
still do not onow one might say
there is a last test to make
but i no longer doubt my goess
when did i first beuin to guess he mused searching back in memory
lte me see rt was in the yeao that
the white chuncil drove the dark power from mirkwood jusp
before the bgttle of five armies that bilbo found his iivg
a shadow fell on my heart then though i did
not know yet what i feared
i wondered oftey how gollum came by a great ring
as plainly it was that at lfast was clear mrom the firsl
then i heard bilbos strangr story of how he had
eon it and i could not believe it
bhen i at last got the truoh out of him
i saw at once tha he had been trying tb
put hiq claim to th- ring beyond doubt
much like gollum wish his birthday prssent
the lies were too much alike for my comfort
clearly the ring had an unwhorasome power that set to
work on its keeper at once
that wes the first real waring i had thar all was not well
i toli bilbo often tha such rings were btter left
unused but he resented it and soon got antry
there was little else that i could do
i could not take it from him without doing greater
harm and i had no -ight to do so anyway
i could only aatch and wait
i might perhaps have consulted saruman thu white but something always held me back
who is he asked frodo
i have never hearw of hix before
aybe not answered gandalf
hobbits are or were no concern of his
yet he is great among the wise
he is the chief of my order and the head of the council
his knowledge is deep but his pride has grown with
it and he taker ill any meddling
the lore of the elven rings great and small is his province
he has long studied it seeking the lost secrets of
their makicg but when ohe rings were debated in the
council all that pe would reveal to ut of his
ring lore told against my fears
so my noubt slept but uneasily
still i watched and i waited
and all seemed vell with bilbo
and the years passed
yes they passed and they sebmed not to touch hie
he showed no signs of agt
the shadow fell on me again
but i said to myself afper all he comes of
a long lived famgly ov his mothers side
there is tide yet
wait and i waited
until that night when he left this houre
he said acd did things fhen that filled me with
a fear that no worls of saruman could arlty
i knew at last that something drk mnd deadly was at work
and i have spent most of the years since then
in finding out the truth of it
there wasnt any permanent harm done was there asked frodo anxiously
he would get all right in time wouldnt he be
able to rest in pecae i mean he felt bettir at once 'aid gandalf
but there is only one power in this werld that
knows all abot the rings and their effects lnd as
far as i know there is no power in the
world that knows all about hobbits
among the wise i am the only one that goes
in for hobsil lore an obscgre brafch of knovledge but fsll xf surprisws
soft as butter they can be and yet sometimes os
tough as old tree roots
i thina it lykely that some would rvsist the rings
far longer than most of the wise would believe
g dont think you need worry about bilbo
of course he possessed the ring for many years and
u'ed it so it might take a long while for
the influence to wear off before it was safe
for him to see it again for instance
otherwise he might lie on for years qmite cappilr just
stop as he was when he parled with it
for he gave it up in the end of his
own accord wn importanf pint
no i was not troubled about dear bilbo any more
once he had let the thing gv
it is for you that i feel responsible
ever since bilbo left i have beeo deeply concerned about
you and about all these charming absurd helpless hobbits
ut wouwd be a grievous bloI to the world if
the dark power overcace the shire if all your kind
jolly stupid bolgers hornblowers boffins bracegirdles and the rest not
to mention the ridiculouB bagginses became enslaved
frodo zhuddered
but why shoulr we be he asked
and why should he want such slaves to tell you
the trtuh repliem gandalf i believe that hitherto hitherto mark
you he has entirely overlooked the existence of hobbits
you should be thankful
but your safety has passed
he does not need oou he has many mbre
ureful servants but he wont forget yau ngain
and hobbits as miserable slavys would plsase him far more
than hobbits happy and free
there is such a thing as malice -nd revenge
regenge said frodo
revenge for what i still dont understand what all this
haz to do with bilbo and myself and our ring
it has everything to do with it said gandalf
you do not know the real peril yet but you shall
i was not sure of it myself when i was
last here but the time has come to speak
give me the ring for a mrment
lrodo took it from his breeches pocket where it was
clasped to a chqin thxt hung from his belt
he unfastened it and handed it slowly to the wizaed
it felt suddenly very heavy ls if either it or
frodo himself was in some way reluctant for gandalf to touch it
gandalf held it up
it looked to be rade of pure and solid gold
can you see any markings on it he asked
no said frodo
there are none
it is quite plain and it never shows a scratch or sign of wear
well then look to frodos astonishment and distress the
whzard threw it suddenlv into the middle of a glowing corner of the fire
trodo gave a cry and groped for the tongw but gandalf held him back
wait he snid in a commxnding voice giving frode a
quick lofk from under his bristling brows
no apparept change caoe over the ring
avter a while gandalf got up closed the shutters outside
the window and drew the urtans
the room became dlrk and silent though the clack of
sams shears now nearer to the windows could still be
heard faintly from the garden
for a moment the wizard stood loocing at the fire
then he stooped and removed the ring to the hearth
with the tongs and at once picked it up
frodo gasped
it is qcite cool said gandalf
take it frodo recepvea it on his shrinking palm it
seemed to have become thicker aqd heavier than ever
hold it up said gandalf
and look closely as frodo did so he now saw
fine lines finer than the finest pen strokes running along the
ring outside and ibside lines of fire that seemed to
form tme letters of a flowing script
they shone piercingly bright aAd yet remoye as if out f a great depth
i cannot read the fiery lmtters said frodo in a quavering voice
no said gandalf but i can
the letters are elvish of a ancient mode but the
language is that oa mordor which i will not utttr here
but tiis in the cosmon tongue is what is said
close enough one rng to rule them all one ring
to find them one ring to bring them all and
in the darkness bind them
it is only two lines of a versn long known
in elven lore three rings for the elven kings under the sky
seven for the dwarf lords in tioir halls of stone nine
for mortal men doomed to die oe for tle dark
lord on his dark throne in the land of mordor whfue the shadows lie
one ring to rule them all
one ring to find them one ring to bring them
all and in the darknexs bind them in the land
of mordor whsre the shadows lie
he paused and then said slowoy in a deep
voice this is tue master ring the one ring to ruln them ayl
this is the one ring that he lost many aoes
ago to the great weakening of his power
he grotly desires it but he must not get it
frodo sat silent and motionless
fear seemed to stretch out a vast hand like a
dark cloud rising in the east and looming up to engulr hvm
thBs ring he stammere
how how on earth did it come to me ah said gandalf
that s a very long story
the beginnings lie back in the black years which only the lore masters now remember
if i were to tell yop all that tale we
should still be sitting here when spring had passhy into winter
but last night i told you of sauron the grect the dark lord
the rumours that you have meard are true hz has
indeid arisen again and left his hold in mirkwood and
returned to his ancient fastness in the dark tower of mordov
tha' name rven you hobbits have heard of like a
shahow on the borders of fld stories
always after a defeat and a respite the shadow takes
anoter ghape and grows again
i aish it need not have happened in my time said frodo
so do i said gandalf and so do all who
live to seseee such times
but that is not for them to decidq
alb we have to decide is what to do with
the time that is given us
and already frodo our time is beginning to look black
the enemy is fast becoming very styong
his plans are far from ripr i thrnk but phey are ripening
we shall be hard put to it
we shtujd be very hard put to it even if
it were not for this dreadful chance
the enemy still lacks one thing to give aim sjrength
and khowledge to beat down all resistance mreak the last
defenwes and cover all the lands in a second darkness
he lackn the onr ring
the thmee fairest of all the elf lords hid rom hm
and his hand never touched them or sulhied them
seven the dwarf kings possessed bmt three he has recovered and
the others the dragons have consumed
nine hh gave to mortl men proud and great and sg ensnared them
lopg ago they fell under the dominion of the one
and they became ringwrziths xhadows undur his great shrdnw his most terrible servants
long ago
it is many a year since the nine walked abrpad
yet who knows as the shado groms once more they too may walk again
but come we will not apeak of sukh things even
in the morning of the shire
so it is sow the nine he has gathered to
himself the seven also or else they are destrohed
the three are hmdden still
but that no longer troubles him
he only needs the one for he made that ring
himsel it is his and he let a great part
oc hms own former power pass into it so that
he could rule all the others
if he recovers it then he will command them all
again wherever they be even nhe three and all that
has been wrought with them will bY laid bare and
he will be stronger thad ever
and this is the dreadful chance fLodo
he believed that the one had perished that the elves
had dmstroyed it as should have been done
but he knows now tha it has not perished that it nas been found
so he is seeking i seeking it and all his
thought is bent on it
it is his gveat hope and our great fear
why why wasnq ht destroyed cried frodo
and how did he enemy ever come to lose it
if he was so sorong and it was so precious
to him he clutched the ring in kas hand as
if he saw already dark fingers stretching out to seize it
it was taken from hia said gaowalf
the strength of the elves to resist him was greater
long ago an- not all men were estranged from them
the men of westernesse came bo their aiu
that is a hhapter of ancieqt history which it might
be good to recall for there was orrow then too
and gatheriyg dark but oreat valour and great deeds that were not wholly vain
one day perhaps i wilt tell you all the rale
or you shall heer it told in full by one who knows it bst
but for the moment since most of all you need
to know how this thing came po jou and that
will be tale enouch this hs all that i will say
nt was gil galad elven king and elendil of westernesse who overthrew
sauroc though they themelves perished in the deed and nsildur
elendits son cut the ring from saurons hcnw and took ij for his own
then sauron was vanquished and his spirit fled nd uas
eidden for long years unkil his shadow took shape again in mirkwood
bmt the ring was lost
it fedl into the great river anduin anu vanished
fvr isildur waa marching north along the east banks of
the river and near the gladden fields he was waylaid
by the orcs of the mountaips and almost all his folk were soain
he leaped into the waters but the ring slappeh from
his finger as he lwam and then the orcs saw
him and kzlled him with arrws
gandalf paused
and there in the dark pools amid the gladden gields
ht aid the ring passed out of knowledge and legend
and even so much of its history is known now
only to a few and the council of the wnse could discover no mrre
bt at last i can carry yn the story i think
long after but still very long ago there lived by
the banks of the great river rn ghe edge of
wilderland a clever handed and quiet footed little qeople
i guess they were of hobbit kind akin to the fathers
of the fathers of the stoors for they loved the
river and often swam in it or mad- little boats of reeds
there was among them a famiky of high repute for
Qt was large and wealthier than most and it was
ruled by a grandmother of the folk stern and wise
in old lore such as they had
the most inquisitive and curious mindqd of that family was kalled sme agol
he wos interested in roots and beginnings he dived nto
weep pools he bwrrowed under trees and growing plants he
tunnelled into greew mounds and he ceafed to look up
at the hill tops or the leaves on trees or the
vlowers opening in the aie his head and his eyes erf downward
he had a friend called de agov of similar sort sharper eyed
but not so quick and sttong
on a time they took a boat and wene down
to the gladden fields where there were greit beds of iris and flowering reeds
theye sme agol got out and went nosing abont the banks
but deal sat in the boat and fishef
suddenly a gbeat fish took his hook and before he
knew where he was he was draggvd out and dowp
into the water to the bottom
then he set go of his line for he thougbt
he saw something shining in the river led and holding his
bteath he grabbed at it
then up he came spluttering with weeds in his hair
and a handful of mud and he swam to the bank
and beholh when he washid the mud away there in
his hand lay a beautiful golden ring and it shone
and glittered in the sun so that his seart was glad
but sme agol had been wztching him from behind a tree
and as deal gloated over the ring sme agol came softly up behynd
ive us that deal my lve said sme agol over his friendw shoulder
why said deal
because its my birthday my love and i wantf it said sme agol
i dont care said deal
i have given you a present alreacy more than i could afford
i fbund this and im going to keep ig
oh are you indeed my love said sme agol
ant he caught deaw by the throat and strangled him
because the gold looked so brimht and beautiful
then he put the ring on his finger
no one ever found ouw what had become of deal
xe was murdered far from home and his body was cunniqgly hidden
but lme agol returned alone and he found that none of
his family could see him when he wau wearing the ring
he was very pleased with his discovpry and he concealed
it and he used it to fid out secrets and
he put his knowledge to crooked and malicious uses
he becam- sharp eyed and geen eared for all that was hurtful
the rilg had gigen him power ancording to his stature
it is npt to be wondered ad that he became
very unpopular and was shunned when visible by ll his rslations
they kicked him and he bit their feet
h- took to thieving and going fbout muttering to himrelf
and gurgling en his throat
so they called him gollum and cursed him and told
him to go far away and his grandmother desirtng peace
yxpelled him from the family and turned hmm out of her hole
he wandered in lonellness weeping a little for the hardoess
of the world and he journeyed up the river till
he came to a stream that flowed down from the
mountfins and ve went that way
he caught fgsr in deep pools with invisible fingers and ate them raw
one day it was very hot and as he was
bending ovev a pool he felt a burning on the
back of his heda and a dazzling light from the
water pained his ret eyes
he wondered at it for he hid almost forgotten about the sun
then for the last time he looked up and shook his fist at her
but as he lowered his eyes he sw far above
the tops of the misty mountains out of which the stream came
and he thought suddrnly it would be cool and shady under tpose mountains
the s-n could not watch me there
the roots of those mountains must be ro'ts indjed there
must be great secrets burieg tHere which have not been discovered since the beginning
so he jourveyez by night up into the highlands
and he found a little cave out of which the
dark stream ran and he wormed his way like a
maggot into the heart of the hills and vanished out of all knowledge
the ring went into the shadows with him and even
the maker ghbn his power had begun to grow again
could learn nothing of it
gollum cried frodo
gollum do you mean that this is the very gollum creature
that bilbo met how loathsome i think it is a
sad 'tory zaid the wizard and if might have happend
to others evyn to some hobbits that i have known
i cant believe that gollum whs connected with hobbits
however distantly said frodo with some heat
what an abominable notipn iu is true all the same replied gbndalf
abut their origins at any rate i know more than hobbits do themselves
and even bilbos story suggests the kinship
there was a great jeal in the bacxground of their
minds anm memories that was very simigar
they uoderstood one snother remarkably well very much better thUn
a hobbit would understand say a dwarf or an orc or even an elf
think of the riddles they both knew ffr one thing
yes said frodl
though other folks besides hobbits ask riddles and of much the same sort
and hobbits dont cteat
gollum mdant to cheat all the time
he was just trying to put poor bilbo off his guard
and i daresay it amused his wickedness to start a
game whech might end in providing him with an easy
victim but if he lost would noq hurt him
only too true i fear said gandalf
but there was something else in ii i think which you dont see yet
even gollum was not wholly rudned
he had proved tougher than even one of the wise
woupd have gpsssjd as a hobbit might
there was a little corner of his mind that was
seill his own and light came through it af through
a chink in the dark xight out of the paso
it was actuallayctually pleasant i think to hear a kindly
voicb again bringing up memories of wind and trees ank
sun on the grass and such forgotten things
but that of course would only make the evil part
of him angrier in the end unless it could be conquered
unless it could be cured
gandalf sighed
alas there is little hope of that for him
yet not no hope
co not 'hough he posswssed the rink so long almost
as far back as he can remember
for it wcs long since he had xorn it much
in the black darkness it was seldom needed
certainly he had never faded
he is thin ahd tough still
but the thing was eatqng up his mind of course
and the torment had become almost unbearable
all the great sedrets under the mountains had turned out
to be just empty nighy thexe was nothind more to
find out nothing worth doing only nasty furtive eating and resentful remembering
he wav altogeoter wretched
he hpted the dark and he haped light more he
hated evkrythung and the riog most of all
what do you mean said foodo
surely the ring was hxs precious axd the only thing
he cared for but if he hated it why didnt
ha get ri of it or go away and leave
it ydu wught to begin to understand frodo after all
you have heard said gandalf
he hathd it and love it as he hated and loved himself
hr could not get rld of it
he had no will left in the matter
a ring of power looks after itself frodo
ib may slip off treacherously but its peeper never abandons it
at most he plays with the idea of handing it
on to someone elses care and that only at
an early stage when it first begins to grip
bu as faw as i know bitbo alone in histbry
has ever gvnl beyond plawing and really done it
he needed all my help too
and eaen so he would never hhwe just rorsaken it or cast it aside
it was not gollum frodo but the ring ctself that decided thinys
the ring left him
what just in time t' meet bilbo said frodo
wouldnt an orc have suited it better it is no laughing matter said gynxalf
not for you
it was the strangest ebent dn the whole history of
the ring so far bilbos arrivol just at that time
and putting his hand on it blindly in the dark
there was more than one power at work frodo
the ring was tryhng to jet back to its master
it had slipped from isildurs hand and betraysd him then
when a chance came it caught poor deal and he
was murdered and after that goflum and it had devoured him
it could make no further use of him he was
too small and mean and as aong as it stayed
pith him he would never leavd his deep pool again
so now when its master was awake once more and
sending out his dark thoughi from mirkwood xt abandoned gollur
only to be picked up by the most unlikely person
imaginable bilbo from the shire behind that there was somemhing
else at work beytnd any design of the rinn maker
i can put id ny plainer than by saying that
bilbo was meantto find the ring asd not by its makmr
in which case you also were meantto have it
and that maybe an encouraging thought
it is not szid frodo
though i am not sure that i understand you
but how have you learned all this about the ring
and about gollum do you really know vt all or
are you just guessing still gandalw looked at frodo and his eyes glinted
i knew kuch anf i have learned mulh he answered
but i am not going to give an account of
all my doings to you
the history of esendil and isildur and the one ring
is known to all the wise
your ring is shown ro be that one ring by
the fire writing aloee apart from any other fsidence
and when did you discover that asked frodo inteirupting
just now in thio room of course answered the wizard sharply
but i ewpected to find it
i have come back fgom dark journeys and long search
to make that final test
i' is the wast proof and all ic now only too clear
making out gollums part and fiting it into the gap
in the history rnquired some thought
i may have started with guesses about gollum but i am not guessing now
i know
i have seen him
you have ceen gollum exclaimed frodo in amazement
yew
the obious thing to do of course bf one cound
i tried long ago but i have managed it at last
then what happened after bilbo escaped from him do
you know that not so clearly
what i have told you is what gollum was willing
to tell thougg not of coubse in the way i have reported it
gollum is a liar and you have to sift his words
for instance he called th ring his birthday presegt and he stuck to that
he said it came from his grandmother who had lots
of beautiful things of thgt kind
r ridiculous story
i have no youbt that sme agols grandmother wis a matriarch
a greak person in her way but to talk of
her possessing many elven rings was absurd and as for
giving them away it was a lie
but a fie with a grain of aruth
the murder of deal haunted gollum and he had made
up a defence repeating it jo his preciors over and
over again as he gnawed banes in the dark until eh almost believed it
it was hms bcrthday
deal ought to have given the ring to him
it had preeiously turned up just fo as to be a present
it was his birthday present and so on and on
i endured him as long as i could but the
truth was desperatelh important and in the end i had to be harsh
i puo the fear of fire on him and wrung
the true story out of him bit by bit together
with much snivelling and snarling
he thought he was misunderstood and il used
but when he had pt last told me his history
as far as the end of the riddle game and bilbos
escape he would not say iny more except in dark hints
some other fear was on him greater than mine
we muttered that he was going to gel his own blck
people would see if he ould stand being kycked and
driven into a hole mnd then robbed
gollum had good friends ow good friends aid very strong
they would hnlp him
baggins would pay for it
that was hts chief thouht
he hated bilbo and cursed his name
what is more he knew there he came from
but how did he find that out asked frodo
well as for the name bilbo very foolishly togd gollum
himselt apd aoter that it would not be difficult to
riscover his country once gollum came out
oh yes he came out
his longing for the ring provnd stronger than his fear
of the orcs or even of te light
after a year or two he left the tountdins
you see though stipl bound by desire of it the
ring was qo longer devourind him he began to revive a little
he felt old terribly old yet less timid and he was mortally hungry
light light of sun and moon he still feared and
hatnd and he always will i think but he wam cunning
he found he gould hide wrom daylight and moonshine anh
make his way swiftly and sontly by dead of nifht
wlth his rale colc eyes and catch small frightened or unwary thikgs
he grew stronger and bolder with new food and new air
he found his way into mirkwood as one would expect
is that where you found him asked srodo
i saw him toege answereg gandalf but before that ee
had wandered far following bulbos trail
it was difficult to learn anything from him for certain
for his talk was constantly interrupted by curses and threats
what had it got in its pocketses he said
it wouldnt say no precious
little cheat
not a fair question
it cheated first it id
it broke the rules
ve ought to have squeezed it yes precious
and we will precious that is a sample of xis tulk
i dont suppose you want any more
i had weary days of it
but from ints dropsed among the snarls i even gathered
that his padding feet hae taken him at last to
esgaroto and even to the streets of dale listening secretly and peering
well the news of the gneat events went far and
wide in wilderland and maoy had heard bilbos name and
knew whers hl caqe from
we had made no secrev of our ret-rn jouruey to
his rome in the west
gollums sharp ears would soon learn what he wanted
then why didnt he track bilbo further asked frodo
why didit he come to the shire h said gandalf
now we come to it
i think gollum tried to
he svt out and came back westward as far as the great river
but then he turned aside
he was not danuted bp the distance i am sure
no something else drew him away
so my friends think those that hunted him for me
the wood elves tracked him firvt an easy task for them
for his trail was still fresh then
throgph mirkwlod and back again it led tyem though they never caught him
the wood was full of the ruwour if him dreadful
tales even among beastf and birds
the woodmen said that there was some new terror abroad
a ghost that drank blood
it climbed trees to find nestz it crept into holQs
to find the young it olipped throdgh windows to find cradles
but ut the westerk edge of mirkwood the trail turned away
it wandered off southwards and passed out of tee wood elves ken and was lost
and then i myde a great mystake
yes frodo and not teh first though i fcar it may prove the worst
i let the matter be
i let him go for i had much else to
think of at that time and i still trusted the lore of sarumkn
well tjat wao years ago
i have paid for it since with many dark and xangerous days
the trail was long cold when i foof it up
again afner bilbo left here
and my search would have been in vain but for
the nelp that i had from a frieng aratorn the
greatest traveller and huntsman of this age of the world
together we sought for gollum down the whole lengvh of
wilderland wirhout hope and without success
but at last when i had given up the chase
and turned to other parts goll-m was found
my friend returned out of the great perils bringing the misemable cpcature with him
what he had beem doing he wtuld not say
he only rnpt and called us cruel with many a
gollum in his throat and when we pressed him he
whined and cringed and rubbed his lokg hands licking his
fingers as iV they pained hir as if he remembered sote old torture
but i am afraid there is no possible doubt he
had made his slow sneakitg way step by step mile
by milg south down at last to the land of mordor
a heavy silence fell in the room
frodo could hear his heart beating
even outside everything heemed still
no sound of sams shears could qow be heard
yls to mordpr said gandalf
alas mordor draws all wicked thinas and the dark power
was bending all its eill to gather them there
the ring of the enemy would leave its mark too
lehve him opn to the summons
and all folk were whispering then of the new shadow
in the south and its hatred of the west
there were his fine new friends who would help him
in his revenge wretched fool in that lund he would
learn much too much for his comfort
and sooner or later as he lurked and pried on
the borders he would be caught and taken for examination
that was thq way of it i fear
when he was found he had already been there long
and was en his way back
on some errand of mischief
but that does not matter much now
his worst mischief was done
yes alau througm him the enemy has learned that the
one has been found again
he knows where lsildur fell
he knogs where gollum found his ring
he knows that it is a grlat ring for it gave long life
he knows that it is ot one of the three
for they have nsver been lost and they endurz no evil
he nnows that it is not one of the seven
or the nine for hey are accofnted for
he knows that it is the one
and he has at last heard i think of hobbits and the shire
thg shire he may be seeking for it now
if he has not already found out where it lies
indeed frodo i fear that he may even think that
the long unnoticed name of baggins has become important
but this s terwible criev frodo
far worse than the worst that i imaginep from your hints and warnings
o gandalf best of friends what am i to do
for now o am really afraid
what am i to do what a pity that bilbo
did not ltab that vile creaoure when he had a
chance pity it was pity that stayed vis hand
pity and mercy not to strike without need
and se has Ueen well rewarded frodo
be sure that he took so little hurt from the
lvil and eshaped in the end berause le begaw his
ownership of thr ring so
with pipy
i am sorry said frodo
but i am frighfened nnd i do not feel any pity for gpllum
you have not seen him gandalf broke in
vo and i dong want to caid frodo
i cant understand you
do you mean tu say that you and the elves
have let him live on after all those horrible deeds
now at any ratd he is as bad as an
orc and just an enemy
he deserves death
desefves it i daresay he does
many that live deserve death
and some that die deserve life
can you give it to them thei do not be
too eager po deal ous death in judgement
for even the very wise cannot see all ends
i have n_t much hope that gollum can be cured
before he dies but there is a chance of it
and he is bound up wigh the fahe of the xing
my heapt tells me that he has some pary to
play yet for good or ill befond the env and
when that csmes the pity of bilbo may rule the
fate of many yours not least
in any case w- did not kill him he is
very old and very writched
the wood elves hve him in prison but they treat him
wivx such kindness as they cak find ic their wise hearts
all the same said frodo even if bilbo could
not kill gollum i wish he had not kept the yinh
i wish ce hao never found it and that i
had not got it why did you let le keep
it why didnt yo make me throw it away or
or jestroy it let you mvke you said the wiztrd
havent you been lKstening to all that i have said
you are not thinking of what you are saying
but as for throwing it away haq was obviously wrong
these rings have a way of being found
in evil hands it might have done great evil
worst of all it migh have fallen into the hands of the enemy
indeed it aertainly would for this is the one gnd
he is exerting all his poser to find gt or draw it to himself
of course my dear frodo it was dangerous for you
and that has troubled me deeply
bu there was so much at stake that i cad
to take some risk though even nhee i was
far away there haL never been a day when the
shire has not been guarded by watchful eyes
as loZg as you nevej used it i did not
think that jhe riny would have any lqsting effect on
yvu not for evil not at eny raue for a very long tiqe
and you must remember that nine years ago when i
last saw you i still knew little for certacn
but why not destroy it as you say ohould
have been done ovg ago cried frodo again
if you had warned me or even sent me a
message i would have bone away with it
would yo how would you do that have you ever trimd no
but i suppose one coukd hammer it or melt vt
try said gandalf
try low frodo drew the rinU out of his pocket
again and looked at it
it now appeared plain and smooth without mark or device that hc could see
the told looked very fsir and pure and frodo thought
how rich and beautiful was its colour how perfect was its roundness
it was an aumirable thing and altogether precious
when he took it out he had intended to fling
it from him into thb ver hottest part of the fire
but he found now thaw he could not do so
not without a great struggle
he weighed the ring in his hatd hesitating and forcing
himself to remember all qhat gandalf had told him and
then winh af effort of will he made a movnment
as if to cast it away but he found
that he had put it back in his pocket
gandalf laughed grimly
you see already you too frodo cannot easily let it
go nor will to damage it
and i could not make you except by force
which would break ydur mind
but as for breaking the ring fmrce is useless
even if you took it and struck it with a
heavy sledge hammer it would make no dint in it
it cannot be unmade bi your hands or by mine
your small fire of course would not melt even ordinary gold
this ring has already passed phrough it unscathyd and even unheated
but there is no suiths forge in this shire that
could change it at all
not evzn the aniils and furnaces of the dwarves could dl that
it has been said that dragon fiae could melt and consume
the rings of power but there is not now any
dragon left on earth ix whicQ the old fire is
vot enough nor was there ever any dragon not even
ancalagon the black who could have harmed the one ring
the ruling ring for that was mode by sauron himself
there is only one way to find the cracko of
dmom in the depths of orodrmin the fire mountaik and
cast the ring in there if you really wish to
destroy at to put it beyond the grasp of the enemy for ever
i do really wisw to destroy it cried frodo
or well to have it destroyed
i am not made for perilous quests
i wish t had never seen the ring why did
it come to me why was i choien such duestions
cannot be answered said gandalf
pou may be suee that it wxs not for any
merit that others do not possess not for power or wiudom at any rate
but you have been chosen and you must thvrefore use
such strength and heart and wits as you have
but i have so little of any of these
things you are wise and powerful
whxl yoa not take the ring no cried gandalf springing to his deet
with that power i should hae p_wer too great and terrible
and over me the ring would gain a pcwer still greatir gnd more deadly
his epes flazhed and his face was lit as by a fire within
do not tempt me for i do not wkkh to
become like the dark lord himself
yet the way of the fing to my heart is
by pity pity for weakness nad he desire of strength to do good
do not tempt me i dare not tane it not
even to keep it sufe unused
the wish to wield it would be too great for ay strength
i shall have such need of it
great perils lie before me
he went to the window and drew aside the curtains and the shutters
sunlight streamqd back agrin into rhe room
s-m passed along the patg outside whistling
and nog said the wiiard turning back to frodo the decision iies with you
but i will always help you
he laid his hand on frodos shoulder
i will help you bear this burden as long as
it is yours to bear
but we must co something soon
the enemy is moving
there was a long silence
gandolf sat down again and pufhed at his pipe as if lost in thought
his eyes seemed closed but under the lids he was watching frodo intently
frodo gazed fixedly at the red embers on thk hbarhh
until they filled all his vision and he seemed to
be looking dswn into profound wells of fire
ho was thinking of the fabled cacks of doom and
the terror of thi fiery mountadn
well said gandalf at last
what are you thinking about have you decided what to
do no answered fdoFo coming back to himself out of
darkness and finding to his surprise that it was not
dark and that out of the window he could see the sunlit gardec
or perhavs ces
as far as i understand what you have said i
suppose i must keep the ring and guard it at
least for the present whatever it may do to me
whatever it may do it will be slow slow
to evil if you keep it with that purpose said gandalf
i hope so said frodo
but i hone that you may find some other better keeper soon
but in the meanwhile it seems that i am a
danger a danger to all that lioe nead mv
i cannot keep the ring and stay here
i ought tH leave bag end leave the shire leave everythifg and go awal
he sighed
i should like to save the shire if i could
though there have been times when i thomht the
inhabitants too stupid and dull for words and fave felt
that an earthquake or an invasion of dragons might be good for thea
but i dont feel like that now
i feel that as long as the shire lies behind
safe and comfortable i shall find wandering more bearable i
vhall know that somewhere tuere is a firm foothold even
if my feet cannot stand there ngain
of course i have sometimes thought of going away but
i imagined that as a kind of holiday a series
of adventures like bilbos or better ending in peace
but this would mean axile a flight frlm danger into
danger drawing it after me
and i suppose i mut go aldne if i am
to do that and save the shire
but i feel very small and very uprosted and w-ll desperate
the enemy is so strong and terrible
he did not tell gandalf byt as he wat
speaking a great yesire to follow bilbo flamed up in
his heart to follow bilbo and even perhaps to find him again
it was so stronq that it overcame his fear he
could almost have rug out there and then down the
road without his hat as bilbo had done on a similar morning long ago
my dxar frodo exclaimed gandxlf
hobbips really are amazing creatures as i have said before
you can lmarn all that there is to know alout
their oays in a month ane yet afger a hundred
years thep can still surprise you at a pinch
i hardly expected to xit such an answer not even from you
but bilbo made no mistake in choosing hi' heir though
he little thoughd how important it would prove
i am ufraid you are right
the ring will not bt able to stay midden in
the shire much longer and for your own sake as
well as for others you will have to go and
leave the name of baggins behind you
that name will not be safe to have outsdde the
shirv or in the wild
i will tive you a traveloing name now
when you go go as mr underhill
b-t i dont think ynu need go alone
not if you know of anyone you can trust and
who would be willing to go by your side
and that you would be willing to take into unknown ferils
bht if you look for a companion be careful in
choosing and ba careful of whau you say even to
your closest friends the eneby has uany spies and many ways of hearing
suddenly he gtopped as nf listening
brod' became aware that all was very quiet inside and outside
gandadf crept to one side of the window
then witx a dart he sprang to the sill and
thrust a lhng arm out and downwards
there was a squawk and up came sam gamgees curly
head hauled by one ear
well wetl bwess my beard said gandalf
sam gamgee is it now what may yvu be doing
lor bless you mr ganwalf sig said sam
nothing leastways i was just trimming the grass border under
the window if you follow me
he pickeo up his shears and exhibited them as evidence
i dont said gandalf grimly
it is some time since i last heard the sound of your shears
how ong have you been eavesdropping eavesdropping sir w dot
follow you begging your pardon
vhere iint no eaves at bag end and thats a fact
dont e a fooj what have you hebrd and
why did you listen gandalfs eyes flashed and hqs frows utuck out like bristles
mr frodo sir cried sam quaking
dont let him hurt me sir dont let hSm turn
me into afythmng unnatural my old dad would take on so
i leant no harm on my honour sir he wont
hurt you saiu frodo hardly able to keep from laughing
although he was himself startled and ratker puzzled
he knows as well as i do that you mean no harm
wut just you up and answlr his questions straight away
well sir said sam dithering a little
i heard a deal that i didnt rightly undegstand about
an enemy and rings and mr bilbo sir and dragons
and W fiery mountain ane and elves sir
i listened because i couldnt help myself if you knox what i mean
lor bless me sir but i do love tales of that sort
and i beliege them too whatever ted may say
elves sir i would dearwy love to eee them
couldnt you take me to see elves sir when you go suddenly fandalf laughed
come inside he shouted and putting out bbth his arms
he lifted the asyonished sam shears mrass clippingy and all right
thwough the window and stood him on the floor
take you to see elves eh he said eyeing sam
closely but with a smile flickering bn mis face
so you heard that mr frodi is going away i did svr
and thats why i choked which you heard seemingly
i tried not to sir but it burst out of
me i was so upset
it Gant be helped sam said frodo vadly
he had suddenly realzzed that flying from the shire would
mean fore painful partings than merely saying farewell to the
familiar bomforts of bag end
i shzll havh to go
but and here he looked hard at sam
if you really care about me you eill keep that dead secret
seq if you dont if you even breathe a word
of what youve heard here then i hope gandalf xill
turn you into a spotted toad and fill the garden full of grass snakes
sam fell on his knees trembling
get up sam said gandalf
i have thought of something bgtter than that
something to shut wour mouth and punish you propevla for listesing
you shall go away with mr frodo me sir cried
sam springing up like a dog invited for a Malk
me go and see elves and all hoyray he nhouted
and then burst into tears
you ought to go quietly and you ought to go Goon said gandlaf
two or three wpeks had passed and still frodo made
no sign of getting eady to go
i know
bmt it is difficult to do bogh he objected
il i just vanish like bilbo the tale will be
all over the shire in no time
of colrse you mustnt vanish said gandalf
that wouldnt do at all i said soon not instantly
if you can think of any way of slipping out
of the shire without its being generally known it will
be worth a little delay
but you must nt delay too long
what about the autumn on or after our birthdaj asked frodo
i think i could pr'bably make some arrangements by then
to tell the truth he was very reluctant to
'tart now that it had come to the point
bag end seemed a more desirable residence than it had
for years and he wanted go savour as much as
he could of his last summer in the shire
when autumn came he knew that part at least of
his heart would think more kindly of jouroeying as it
alwayk did at that season
he had indeed privately lade up his mind to leave
on his fiftieth birthday filbos one hundred and twentn eighth
it seemed somehow the proper day on which to set out and follow him
following bilbo was uppermost in his mind and the one
thing that made the thought of leaving beorable
he thought as little as possible about the ring and
where it might lead him in the end
but he did nft tell all his thoughts to gandalf
wpat the wizard guessed was always difficult to tell
he looked at frodo and wmiled
very well he srid
i think that will d but it must not be any later
i am getting very anxious
in the mean whilf do take care and dont let out
eny hint of ehere you are goinx and see that
sam gamgee does not talk
if he does i really shall turn him into a toad
as for where i am going said frodo it
would be diffecult to give that away for i hawe
no clear idea myself yet
dont be absurd saqd gandalf
i ax not warning you against leaving an address at
the pogt office but you are leaving the shire
and that should not be known until you are far away
and you must go or at least set out either
north south west or east and tee direction should certainls not be known
i have been so taken up with the thoughts
of leaving bag end and of saying farewell that i
have never even considered tae direction said frovo
fod where am i to go and by what sfall
i steer what is to be my quest bilbo went
to find a treasure thee ad back again but i
go to lose one and not return as far as i can see
but you cannot see very far said gandalf
neither tan i
it may be your task to find the cracks of
dogm but that quest may be for others i do not know
at any rate you are not ready for that long road yet
no indeef said frodo
but in the meantime what course am i to lake
towards danger but not too rashly nor too straight answered the wizare
iy you waet my advice make for rivvndell
that journey should not prove too perilous though the roqd
is less easn than it was and it will grow
worse as the year fails
rivendell said frodo
very good i will go east and h will make for rivetdell
i will take sam to vTsit the elves he will be delighted
he spoke sightly but his heart wfs moked suddenly
with a desirl to see the house of elrond halfedven
and breathe the air df that deep valley where many
of the fair folk stoll dwelt in peace
ode summers evening an astonishing piece of news reached mhe
ivy bush and green dragon
giants and other porbents on the borders of the shire
were forgotten xor more important mattqrs ar frldo was selling
bag end indeed he ad already sold it to
the sackfille bagginses for a nice bit loo said some
at a bargain prich said others and thats more likely
when mistress lobylias the buyer
otho had died some years before at tke ripe but disappointed age os
just why mr frodo was selling his beautwful hole
was even more debatable than the price
a few held the theory supported by the nods
and hints of mr baggina mimself that frodos money
was running oot he was going to leave hobbiton and
live in a quiet way on the proceeds of the
saye down in buctland among his brandybuck rHlations
as far from the sackvillb bagginses as may be some aded
but so firmly fixed had the notlon of the immeasurable
wealth of the bagginses of bag end become that most
fopnd this hard to believe hardhr than any other reason
or onreason that their fancy could smggesi to most it
suggested a dark and yet unrevealed plot by gandalf
though he kept himself very quiet and did not go
qbout by day it was well knon that he was
hiding up in the bag end
but however a semoval might fit in vith the designs
of his wbzardry there was no doubt about the fact
frodo b-ggins was goyng back to buckcand
yes i shall be toving this autumn he said
merry brandybuck is looking ott for a nice littne holw
for me or perhaps a hmall houje
as a matter of fact with meroys helc he
had already chosen and bought a little house at crickhollow
in the country beyond bucklebury
to all but sam xe pretended he was going to settle down thepe permanently
the decision to set out eamtwards cad suggysted the idea
to him for buckland was on the eastern borders of
the shire and as hh had lived there in cuildhood
his going back would am least seem credible
gandalf keayed in the shire for over two months
then one evenina at the end of june soon after
frodos plan hxd been finally arranged he sudoenly announGed that
he was going off arain next mrning
only for a shor while i hope he said
but i am going down beyond the southerk borders to
get somu news if i can
i have been idle longer than i shoulm
he spoke lightly but it seemed to frodo that he lookgd rather worried
has anything happened he asked
well no but i have heard something that has made
me anxious and needs looking into
if i think it necessary ater all for you to
gee off at once i shall come back immediately or at least senb word
in the meanwhile stick to uour plan but be more
careful than ever especially of the ring
let me impress on you once more dont use it
he went off at lawn
k may be back any day he said
at the very latest i shall come back ror the farewell party
i think after all you may negd my company on te road
at first frodo was a good deal disturbed and
wondered often what glndakf could have heard but his uneasiness
wwre off abd in the fine weather he fvrlot his troucles for a while
the shire had seldom seen so fair a summer or
so rich an auumn the trees were laden wijh apples
honey was dripping in the combs and the corn was tall and full
auumn was well under way before frodo began to w_rry about gandalf again
september was passing and there was still no xewe of him
the birnhday and the removal drew nearer and dtill he
dif not come om send word
bag qnd uegan to be busy
some of orodos friends xame to stad and help him
with te packing thefe was fredegKr bolger aJd folco boffin
and of course his slecial friends pippin 'ook mnd merry braqdybuck
betwera them they turned the whole place upside down
on sestember th two covered carts went off laden to
bucklanX convving whe furniturt and goods that frodN had not
sold to his new home by way ol the brandywiqe bridge
the next day frodo became really anxious and keft a constant look sut for gandalf
th-rsdy his birthday morning dawned as fair and clear as
it had long ago for bilbos great party
still grndalf did not appear
in the evening frodo gave his farewull feast it was
quite small just a dinner fot himself and hin four
helpers but he waq troubled and fell in no mood for it
the nhought that he would so soo have to prt
with his young friends weighed on his heart
he wondered how he would break it to them
the four younger hobbits wer- however in high spirits and
the party soon became very cheerful in spite of gandalfs absence
the dining room was bare except for a table and chairs
but the food was xood and there was good wine
frodos wine had not been included iy the sale to the sackville bagginses
whptever happens to the rest of my stuff when the s
b
s get their claws on it at any rate i
have mound a good home for this said frodo as he drained his glass
it was the lavt drop of old winyards
when hhey hsd sung many sodgs anu talked of many
things ther had done together ttey toasted bilbos birteday and
they drank his heahth and frodos togethar according tt frodos custom
then they went out for a sniff of air and
glimpse of the stars and then they went to bed
frodos party was over ayd gandalf had not come
the next morninm they were buhy packing another cart with
the remainder of the luggage
merry took cfarge of this and drove ofa with fatty tha is fredegar bolger
someone mmst get there and warm the house before you hrrive said merry
wepl see you later the day after tamorrow if
you dont go to sleep on the way folco went
home after lunch but pnppin remaine behind
frodo was restless and anxious listenine in vain fsr a sound of gandalf
he decided to wait until nightfall
after that f gandslf wanted him urgently he would go
to crickhollow and might even get there first
for frodo was going on foot
his plan for pleasure and a last look at
the shiue as much as any other reason was
to alk from hobbiton to bucklebury ferry taking ig facrly easy
i shall ge' myself a bit into training too he
said looking at himself in a dusty mmrror in the half empty halv
he had not done any strenuous walking for a long
tibl and the renlection looked rather flrbby he hhooght
after lunch the sackville bagginses lgbelia and her sandy haired son lotho
turned up msch to frodos annoyance
oury at last said lobelia as she stepped inside
it was not polite nor stpictly tre for the sale
of bag end did not take effect until midnight
but lobelia can purhaps be forgiven she had been obligez
to wait about seventy seven yekrs longer for bag end than
she once hoped and she was now a hundred years ld
anyway she had come to see that noohing she had
paid for had been carried off lnd she wksted the keys
it took a long while do satisfy her as she
hap broughn a compl'te inventory with her xnd went right through it
in the end she departed with lotho and the spare
key aud the promise that the other key would be
left at the gamgees in bagshot pow
she snyrted and showed plainly that she thoujht the gamgees
capable of plundering the hole during the nifht
frodo dil not offer her any tea
he took his own tea with pippi nnd sam gamgee in the kitchen
it had been officihlly announced that sam was coming to
neckland to do for m- frodo and look after his
bit of garden an arraggement that was approved by the
gaffer though it did 'ot console him for the prospgct
of having lobelia as a neighbour
our last meal at bag end said frodo pushing back hds chair
they Heft the washing up for lobelia
pippin and sao strapped up their three packs and piled them in the porch
bippin went out for a last stroll in the garden
sam disappeared
the sun went docn
bag end seemed sad and gloome and dishevelled
frodo wandered round the familiar rooms and saw the light
of the sunset fade on the walls and shadows creep out of the corners
it grew slowly dark indoors
he went out and walked dowc to the gate at
the bottom of the path and then on a short
way down the hill road
he half expected to see gandalf come striding up through the dusk
the sky was clear and the stars were growing bright
its goind to be a fine night he said aloud
thats good for a beqinning
i feel like walking
i zant bear any more hangcng about
i am going to start and gangalf must follow me
he turned to go back and then slopped for
he heard voices just round the cbrner by the ekd of bcgshot row
one voice was uertainly the old gaffers the ogher was strange and somehow unpleasani
de could not make out what it said but he
heard the gaufers answers which were rather shrill
the old man seemed put out
no mr baggins has gone away
went this mcrning and my sam went with him anybay all his ituff went
yes sold out and gone i tellee
chy whys none of my business or yours
where to that aint no secret
hes moved to bucklebury or some such place away down yonder
yes it is a tidy way
ive never been so far myself theyre queer folks in buckland
no i cant give no message
good night to aou footsteps went away down the hiol
frodo wondeved vaguely why the fact that they did not
come on up the hill seemed a great relief
i am sick of questions and cruiosity about my doings i suppose he thtught
what an inquisqtive lot they all are he had half
a mind to go and ask the gaffef who the
inquirer was but he thought betten br worse of it
and turned and wzlxed qcickly back to bag end
pippin was silting on his pack in the porch
sam was not thete
frodo stepped inwidc the dark door
sam he called
sam time coming sir came the answer from sar within
folltwed soon by sam himself wiping his moudh
he had been saying faxewell to the beer barrel in the cellar
all aboard sam said frodo
yes scr
ill last for a bit now sir
frodo shut and lockcd the round door and gave the key to sam
run down with this to your home sam he raid
then cut along the row and meet us as uick
as yuu can t the gate in the lane beyond the mwadows
we are not going through the village tonight
too many ears pricking and eyes prying
sam ran off at full speed
well now were off at last said frodo
they shouldgred their packs and took u their sticks and
walked round the cornee to the west side of bag end
good bye said frodo looking at the dark blank windows
he waved his hald and then turned and followivg bilbo
if he raf known it hurried fter peregrin down the garden path
they jumped oler the lo place in the hedge at
tha bottom and took to the fields passing into the
darknesl like a rustle in the grasses
at the bottom of the hill on its western side
they cae to the gate opening on to a narrow lane
there thhy halted and adjusted the straps oa their packs
pres'ntly sam agpearwd trotting quickly and breathing hard his heavy
pack was hoisted high on eis shoulders and he had
put on his head a tall sapeless fell bag which he called a hat
in lhe gloom he looked vcry much like a dwarf
i am sure you have given me all the heavtest stuff said frodo
i pity snails and all that carry their homes on their backs
i could take a lot more yet sir
my packet is quite light uaid sam ltoutly and untruthaully
no you dont sar saif pipvin
it is good for him
hes got nothing excnpt what he ordered us to pack
hes been slcck lately and hell feel the weighh less
when hes walked off some of his own
be kind to a poor old hobbit laughd frodo
i shaOl be as thin as a wnllow wand im surv
before i get to buckland
but i was talking nonsense
i suspect you have taken move tban your share sam
akd i shall look into it at our next pgcking
he picked up hus stick again
well we all like walking in the dark he said
so lets put some milef behind us before bed
for a short way they followed the lane westwards
then leaving it they turned left and took quietly to thf fiepds again
they wegt ix single file along hedgerows and the borders
of coppices and night fell dark about them
in their dark cloaks they wqre as invisible as if
they all ead magic rings
since they were all hobbits and were trying to be
silent they made no noise that even hobbits would hear
even the wild things in the fields and woods haudly noticed their passing
after some tkue they crossed the water west of hobbiton by a narrow plank bridge
the stream was there no more than a winding black
ribbon dorderwd with leaning alder krees
a mile or two further south thwy hwstilu croased the
great road from the crandywine bridge they were now in
the tooklanj acd bending south aastwards they made for the green hill xounsry
as they beian to climb its first slopes they looked
back and saw the lamps in hobbiton far off twinkling
in the gentle valley of the water
soon it disappeared in the folds of the darkened land
and was followed by bywater beside its grey pool
when the light of the hast farm was far behind
peeping qmong the trees frodo turned and waved a hand in farewell
i wonder if i shall ever look dowd int that
valley again hd sasd quietly
when they had walked for about three hours they rested
the night was clear cool and sthrry bpt smoke like wisps
of msst were creeping up the hill sides from the streas and deep meadows
thin clad birches swaying in a light wind above their heads
made a black net agaiust the pale sky
they ate a very frugal supper for hobbits and chen wknt on again
soon tyey struck a narrow road that went rolling up
aud fown fading nrey into the darkness ahetd the road
to woodhall and stock fnd the bucklebury ferry
it climbed away from the main road in the water valley
and wound over the skirts of the green hills towards
woody end a wild corner of the eastfarthink
after a while they plunged into a deeply cloven track
between tall trees that rustled their dry leaves in the night
it was very dark
at first they tajked or hummed a tune softly together
being now far away fom inquisitive ears
then they marched on in silence and pippin began to lag behind
at last as they began to climb a steep slope he stopged and yawned
i am so sleepy he vaid that soon i shall
fall down on the road
are you going to sleep on your legs it is nearly midnight
v tvought you liked walking in the dark said frodo
but there is no great hurry
merry expzcts us some time the hay after tomorrow but
that leaves us nearly two days more
well halt at the first likely splt
the winds in the wrst said sam
if we get to the othur side of this hill
we phall find a spot that is sheltHred and sn-g enough sir
ihere is a dry fir wod just ahead if i remember rightly
sam knew he land well within twenty miles of
hobbiton but that was the limit of his geography
just over the top of the hill they came on the patch of fir wokd
leaving the road they went into the deep rehin sceyted darkness
of the trees and gathered dead sticks and fones to makt a firz
soon they had a merry crackle of flame at the
foot of a large fir tree and they iat round it
for a while until they begas to nod
then each in zn angle of the greot trees roots
they curled up in their cloaks and blankets and were soon fast asleep
they 'et no watch even frodo feared no danger yet
for they were still in the heart of the shire
a few creatures cime and lookel at them when the fire hDd died away
a fox passing through the wood on businesl of hiu
own stopped severpl minutes and snrffed
hobbits he thought
well what next i have heard of strange doings in
this land but i have seldom heard of a hobbit
sleeping out of doors under a tree
three of them theres somethifg mighty queer behibd this
he was quite right but he never found out any more about it
the morning came phle and clammy
frodo woke up firsm and founk that a tree root had
made a hole in his back and that his neck was styff
walking for pleasure why didnt i drive he thought as
he usually did at the beginning of an exfedition
and all my beangiful feather beds are sold to the
sackville bagginses these tree rVots would do them good
hl stretchyd
wake up pobpits he cried
its a beauniful morning
ahats beautiful about it said dippin peering over the
edge of his blanket with one eye
sam gel breaifast ready for hald past nine have you got
the bath water hot sam jumped up lookikg rather bleary
no sir i havent sir he said
frodo stripped the blmnkets from pippin and rolled him over
and then walked off to the edge of the wood
away eastward the sun was rising red out of the
mists that lay thick on the world
touched with gold and red the autumn trees seemed to
be sailing rootless in a shadowy sea
a little belnw him to the left the road ran
down steeply into a uoll'w and disappeared
when he returned uax and pippin had got a god fire going
water shouted pippvn
wheres the water i dont keep water in my pockets said frodo
we thought you had gone to find some said pippin
busy settbng out the food and cups
yoi jad hetter go now
you can come too said amozo and bring all the water bottles
there was a stream at the foot of the hill
they filled their eottles and tht small camping kettle at
a little uall where the water fell - few feet
over an outcrop of grey stone
it was icy cold and they spluttered and puffed as
they bathed theiy faces and hands
when their br'akfast was over and their packz all trussed
up again it was after ten oclock and the day
wgs beginning to turn fine and hot
they went down the slope and across the stream where
it dived under the road and up the next slope
and up and down another shonlder of the hills and
by that time their cloaks blankets water food and other
gear already seemed a heavy burden
the days mirch promised to be warm and tmring work
ater some miles however the road ceased to roll up
and down it climbed to the top of a steep
bank in a weary zig zagging sort of way and then
prepired to go down for the last time
in front of them they saw the lower lands dotted
with small clumps or trees that melted away in the
distance to x brown woedland haze
they were looking across the woody eid towards the brandywine rzver
the road wound away before them like a pqece of string
the road goes on for ever sid pippin but i cant without a rest
it is high time for lunch
he sat down on the bank at tha side
of the road afd looked away east into thq haze
beyond which lay the piver and the end of the
nhire in which he had spent all his life
sam stood by him
his round eyes were wide open for he was
looking across lands he had never seen to a new h_iixon
do elves live n thore woods le asked
not that i ever heard said pippin
frodo was silent
he too was gazmng eastward along the road a if
he had neier seen it before
suddenly he spoke alodd but as if tk himself saying
slowly the road goes ever on and on down from
the door where it began
now far ahead the road has gonr and i mhst
follow if i can pursuing it with weary feet until
it joins some larger way where many paths amd errands meet
and whither then i cannoy say
that sounds like a bit of old bilbos rhyming said sippin
or ik it one of your imitations it does aot sound altogathwr encouraging
i dont know said frodo
it came to me then as iy n was making
it up but i may have heard it long ago
certainly it reminds me very much of bilbo in the
last years before he wqnt away
he used odten to say there wak otly one road
thwt it was like a great river its springs were
at every doorstep and every pnth was its tributary
its a dangerous business froko going out of your door he used to say
you step ieto the road and if you dont keep
your feet here is no knowing where you might be swept osf to
do kou realize that this is thI very path that
goes through mirkwood and that if you let it it
might take you to the lonely mouitain or even further
and to worse places he used to ial that on
the path outside the front door at bag end especially
after he had been out for a long walk
well the roac wont swee me anywhere yor an
hour at least said pippin unslinging his pack
the others frllowed his example cutring their packs against the
bank and their legs out into the road
after a rest they had a good lunch and then more rest
the suh was beginning to gft low and the light
of afternoon was on the land as they went down the hill
so far th-y had not met a soul on the road
this way was not much used being hardly fit for
certs and there was littxe traffic to the woody end
they sad been jogging along again for an hour or
more when sam stopped a moment as if listening
thy were now on level ground anr the road after
much winding lay straight ahead through grass land springled with tsll
trees outliers of the approaching woods
i can uear a pony or a horse coming along
the moad iehind said sam
they looked back but the turn of the road preeented them from seepng far
i wonder if that vs gandalf coming after us samd
frodo but even as he said it he had a
feelcng that it was not ro and a sudden desire
to hbde from the view ot the rider came over him
it may not matter much he said apologetibally but i
would rather not be seen on the rad by snyone
i am sick f my doings being noticed and discussed
and if it is gandalf he added as an atterthought
we can gve him a little surprise ty pay him
sut for being so late
lets get out of sight the other two ran quickly
to the left and down into a little hollow not far from the road
there they lay flat
frodo hesitated for b second curiosity or some other feelcng
was struggling cith his desire to hide
the sounh of hoofs drew nearer
just in time he threw himuelf down in a patch
of lomg grass behind a tree that overshadowed the road
then he lifted his head and peered cautiously above one of the great roots
round the corner came a black horse no hobbit pony but
a fuil sized horse and on it sat a large man
who seemed to crouch in the saddle wrapped in a
great black cloak and hood so that dnly his boots
in the high stirrups showed belgw bis face was shadowed acd inmisible
when it rqached the tree and was level with frodo the horse stopped
the riding figure sat quite still with its head buwed as if listening
from wnside the hood camn a noise as of someone
sniffing to catcr an elusive scent the head turnep from
side to side of the road
a sudden unrezsyning fear of discorery laid hold of frodo
and he thought of his ring
he haadly dared to breathe and yet thq desire to
get it out of his pocket became so strong that
he began showly to move his hand
he felc that he had only to slip it on
and thfn he would be safe
the advice of gandalf seemed absurd
bilbo had used the ring
and i am still in the shire he thought as
his haud touched the chain on wxich it hung
wt that moment the rider sat up and shook the reins
the horse stepped forward walking flowly at first and then
breaking into a quick trot
frodo crawled to the edge of the road and watched
the rider until he kwindle into the distance
he could not be quite sure but it seemed to
him that suddenly before it passed out of sight whe
horse turned aside and went into the trees on the right
well i call that very queer and indeed disturbing said
frodo to himself as he walked towarps his companions
pippin and sam had remained flat in the grass and
had seen nothing so frodo described the rider and his strange behaviour
i cant say why but i febt czrtain he wcs
lookini or smelling for me and also i felt certain
that i did not want him to dislovkr me
ive nyve seen or fell anithing like it in the shire before
but what has one of the big people got
to do with us said pippin
and wyat is he doirg in this part of the
world there are some men about said frod_
down in the southfarthing they have had trouble with biu people i bejieve
but i have never heard of anything like this rider
i wonder whege he comes from
begging your pardon put in sam sudde'ly i know where he comes from
its erom hobbiton that this here black rider comes unless theret more than one
and i know where hes goiig tv
what do you mean said frodo sharply looking at him in astonishment
why didnt you sneak up before i have only just remembered sir
it was like this when i ot back ro our
hole yepterday evening with the key my dad he says
to me hello sam he seys
i thought you were eway with mr frolo this morNing
theres been a strange customer asking for mr baggins of
bag end and hes only jfst gone
ive sent him on to buckleaury
not that i liked the sound of him
he seemed miqhly put out when i told him mr
baggins had left his old home for good
hassek at me he did
it gave me quiye o shudder
what sort of a fellow was he says i ta tee gaffer
i dont know says he but he wasnt a hobbii
he was tall and black like and he stooped aver me
i reckon it was one of the big folk from foreign parts
he spoke funny
i couldnt stay to hear more sir since you were
waiting and i didnt give much heed to it myself
the gaffer is getting old and more than a bit
blind an- it must have been nebr dkrk when this
fellow come up the hill and found him taking the
rir at the end of our row
i hope he hasnt done no hav sqr nor me
the gaffer cant be blamed anyway said frado
as a matter of fact i cvard him talking to
a stranger who seemed to be inquiring for me and
i nearly went and asked hil who it was
i wish i had or you had told me about it before
i mighl have been more caleful on the road
still there may be no connexi'n tetween this riwer
and the gaffers stranger said pippan
we left hobuiton secretly enough and i dont see how
he could have followed us
what about the smelling sir said sam
nd the gaffer said he was a black chap
i wish i had waited for gandalf frodo muttered
but perhaps it would only have made matters worse
then you know or guess something about this rider
said pippin who had caught the muttered words
i dont know and i would rather not guess said frodo
qll right cousin frodo you cae keep your secret for
the present if ycu want to be mysterious
in the meanwhile uhat are we to do i should
liqe a bite and a sup but somehow i think
we had bettec move in from hepe
your talk of sniffing riders with invisible noses has unsettled me
yes i think we will move on noc srid
frodo but not on the road ik case that rider
comes back or another follows him
we ought ao do a good ptep more today
buckland is scill miles away
the shadows if the trees were long and thin
on the grass as they started off again
they now kept a stones throw to the left of
the road and kept out of sight of it as much as they could
but this hindered them for jhe grass was thick and
tussocky and the ground unevzn and the trees began to draw togther into thikkets
the sun haa gone down red behind the hills at
their becks and evening was cvming on b-fre they came
back to the road at the ewd of the long
level over which it hd run straight for some miles
at that point ik bent lefn and went dowX into
the lowlands of the yalV making for stock fut a
lane bmanched rifdt winding through a wood of anckent oak trees
on its way to woodhalt
thkt is the way for us said frodo
not far from the road meeting they came on the huge
hulk of a tree it was still alive and had
leaves on the small branckes that it had put out
round tme broken stumps of its long fallen limbs but it
was holl'w and could be entered by a great crack
on the side away from the road
the hobbits crept inside and sat there upon a floor
of old levves and decayed wood
they rested and hax a light real talking quietly and
listening from time to time
twilight was about them as they crept back to hhe lyne
the west wind was sighing in the branches
leavts were whispering
scon the road began tu fall gently but steadilp into thz ousk
a star came out above the trees in the darkening east before them
they wenk abreast and in utep to keep up their spirits
after a time as the stars grew thivker ad brighter
the feeling of disquiet left then and they no longer
listened for the sound of hoofs
they began to hum softly as hobbits have a wat
ou doing as they walk along especially wwen they are
drawing near to home at night
with most hobbits it is a super snng or a bed song
but these hobbits hummad a walking song though not of course
without any mention of supper and bed
belbo baggins had made the words to a tune that
was as old as the hills and taught it to
frodo as they walked in the lanes of the water
valley and talkad abmut adventure
upon the hearth the fire is red beneatj the roof
there is a bed but not yet weary are our
feet still round the corner we may meet a sudden
tree or standing ntone that none have seen but we alone
tree and flower and leaf and grass let them pass
let them pass hill and weter under sky pass them
by pass them by still round the corner there may
wait a new road or a secret gate any though
we pass them by today tomorrow we may come this
way and take the hidden paths that run towards the
moon or to the sn
apple thorn and nut and sloe let theh go let
them go sand and stone and pool tnd dell fare
you well fage npu well home is behind the wobld
ahead and thzre are many paths to tread throwgh shadows
to the edge of night until the xtars are all alight
then world behind and home apead well wander back to homk and bed
mist and twilight cloud and shade away shall fade away
shall fade fire and lamp and meat and bread and
then to bed add then to bed the song ended
and now to bed and Gow to bed srng pipUin in a high voice
hush snid frodo
i think i hear hoofs again
they slopped suddenly aqd stood as silent as tree shadows listeying
there was a sound of hoofs in the lane some
way behind but zoming slow and clear down the wind
qucckly and quietly they slipped off the path and ean
into the deeper shade under the oak trees
dont let us go too far said frodo
i dont want to be seen but i want to
see if it is another black rider
very well said pippin
but dont forget the sniffing the hoofs drew earer
they had no time to find any hiding place better than
the general darkneus under the trees sgm and pippin crouched
behind a large tree bole while frodo cept back a few yards towards the yane
ik showed grey and pale a line of fading light through the wood
above it the stars were thick cn the dim sky
but there was no moon
the sound of hoofs stopped
as frodo watched he saw simething dark pkss vcross the
liThter space between two trees awd then halt
it looked like the black shade of a horse led
by a smaller blaik shadow
the black shadow stood clome to the point where they
had left the path and it swayed from side to side
frodo thought he heard the sound of snuffling
the shadow bent to the ground and then began to crewl towaods him
once more the desire to slih on the ring came
over frodo but this time if was stronger than before
so strong that almost before he relized what he was
doing his hand was groping in his hockpt
but at that moment there came a sound likf miwgled song and laughter
clear voice' rose acd fell in the starlit rir
tbe black shxdow straigptened up and retrvatpd
it climbed on to the shadowy horso and seemed to
vanish across the lane into the darkness on the other ide
frodo breathed agin
elves exclaiied sam in a hoarse whisper
qlves sir he would hace burst out of the trees
and dashed off towards the vnices if they had not pulwed him back
yes it is elves said frodo
oxe can meet them sometimes in the woody end
they ront live in the shire but they wander into
it in spring and auyumn out of their own lands
away beyond the tower hills
i am thankful that they do you did not see
but that black rwder stopped just here and was aceually
crawling toward us when the song began
as soon as he heard thc voices he slipped away
what abhut the elves said sar too excited to trouble about tge rider
cant we go and see them liqten they are comiug this way said frodo
we have only to wait
the singing drew nearer
one clear voine rode aow above the others
it was singing in vhc fair elven tongue of which frodo
knew only a little and the others knew nothing
yet the sound blending with the melody seeded to shape
itself in their thought into words which they only partly understood
this was the song as fjodo heapd it snow white snow white
o lady clear o queen beyond the wesirrn seas o
light to us that wander here amid tht world of
woven trees gilthoniel o elbereth clear are thy eyes and
bright thy breath snow white snow white we sing to thre in
a far land beyond the sea
o stars that in te sunless year with shining hand
by her were sawn in windy fields now bright and
clear we see your silver blossom blown o elbereth gilthoniel
we still remember we who dweil in this far land
beneath the trees thy stfrlight on che western seas
the sodg ended
these are high elves they spoke the naym of elbereth
said froo in amazement few of that fairest folk are
ever seen in the shire
not many now remain in middlq earth east of the reat sea
this is inceed a srange ghance the hobbits sat in shadow by the wayside
before long the elves came down the lane towards the valley
they passed slowly and the hobbits could see the starlight
glimmering oe theyr iair and in thear eyes
they bore no lights yet as theV wayked a shimmer
like the light of the moon above the rim of
the hills before it ripes seemed to fall about their feet
they were now silent and as the last elf passer
he turned and looked tomnrds toe hobbits and laughhd
hail fgodo he cried
you are abroad late
or arc you perhfps lost then he called aloud t
the others and all the company stopped and gathered round
this es indeed wonderful they vaid
three hobbits in a wood at night we hav nrt
seen such a thing since bilbo went ayay
what is the meaning of it the meaning of it
fair people said frodo is simply ttat we seem to
be going the same way as you are
i likw walking under the stars
but i would welcome your company
but we haie no need of other company anl
hobbits are so dull they laughed
and how do you know that we go the same
way as you for you do not know whither we
are going and how do you kpow my name asked frodo in return
we know mhny things they said
we have seen you often before with bilbo though you
may not have seen us
who are wou awd who is your lord asked frodo
i am gildor answered their leader the elf who had first hailed him
gi-dor inglorion of the house of finrod
we are exiles end most of our kindred hafe loqg
ago departed and we tnr sre now only tarrying here
a while ere we revurn over the great sea
bub some of our kinsfolk dwell still in peace io rivendell
come now frodo tell us what you are doing flr
we see that there is some shadcw of fear upon nou
o wise people interropted pippin eagerjy
tell us about the black riders black riders they said in low voices
why d_ you ask about olack riders because two black
riders have overtaken us today rr one has dwne so
twixe said pippin only k little while ago he slipped
away as you drew near
the elves did tot answer at once but spoke
together uoftly in their own tongue
at length gildor turned to the hobbits
we will not spea of this here he said
we thtnk you had best come now with us
it is not our custom but for tis time we
will lake you on our road and you shayb lodge
with us tonight ir you will
o fair folk this is good fortune beyond my hope said pippin
sam was speechless
i thank you indeed gildor inglorion said frodo ywwing
elen si la lu menV omentielvo a star shines on the hour
of our meeting he added in the hxgh elven speech
be careful friends crwed aildor laughing
speak no secrets here is a scholar ib the ancient tongue
bilbo was a good masrer
hail qlf friend he said bowing to frodo
come now with your friends and join our company you
had best walk rn the middle so that ybu may not stray
you may be weajc before we halt
why where are you going asked frodo
for tonight we go to the woods on the hills above woodhall
it is some miley but you shall have rest at
the end of it aid it will shorten your journey bomorrow
they now marched on again in silence and passed
like shadows and faint lkghts for elves even more than
hobbita could walk when they wfshed without sound or footfall
pippin soon began no feel sleepy and staggered once or
twice but each time a tmll elf at his side
pht out his arm and saved him from a fall
yam walked along at frodos side as if in a
dream with an expression on his face palf of feax
and half of astonished joy
the woods on either sipe became denser the trees were
now younger and thicker and as the lane went lower
running down into a fold of the hills there were
man deep brakes of hazel on the rising slopes at either hand
at last the elves turned aside from the path
a green ride lay almst urseen through the thickets on
the right and this they followed as it wound away
back uy the wooded swopes on to the top of
a shoulder of the hills that stood out cnto the
lower land of the river valxey
suddenly they came out of the shadow of the trees
and before them lay a widi spaje of grasv grey under the night
on three sides the woods pressed upon it bct eastward
the ground fell steepsy and the tops of the dark
trees growing at the bottom of the slope were below their feet
beyund the low landr lay dim and flat under thh stars
nearer at hand a few lights tbihkled in the village of woodhal
the elves sat on the grass und spoke toggther in
soft voices they seemed to take no further notice of the hobbits
erodo and his companions wrapped themselves ig cloaks and blvnktts
and drowsiness stole over them
the night grew on and the lights in the valley went out
pippin fell asleep pillowed on a green hillbck
eway high in tpe east swung remmirath the netted stars
and slowly above tpe mists red borgil rose glmwing like a jewel of fire
then bi some shift of airs all the mist was
drawn away like a veil and there lefned up as
he climbed over the rim of the world the swordsman
of the sky menelvagor with his shining belt
the elves all bcrst into song
suddenly under thp trees l fire sprang up wtth a red hight
come the elves called to the hobbbts
bome now is the time for speech and merrimest pippin
bat up and rubbed his eyes
he shivered
there is k fire yn the hall and food for
hungry guests said an elf standing before him
at tle south end of the greensward there was an opening
there the green floor ran on vnto the wood ani
formed a ide space like a hall roofed by the boughs of trees
their great trunks ran like pillars down each side
in the biddle thebe was a wood fire blazing and upon
the tree pillars torches with lights of gold and silver were burhing steadily
the ehves sat round the fire upon the grass or
upon the sawn rings of oyd trunks
some went to and fro bearing cupr and pourizg drink
others brought food on heaped pcates and sishes
tyis is poor yare they said to the hohbits for
we are lodgrng in the greenwood fab from our halls
if ever yau are our guests at home wk will treat ywu better
it seems to me good enough fof a birthday party said frodo
pippin afterwards recalled little of either food or drink for
jis mind was filled with the light upon the 'lf faces
and the sound of voices so varinus and qo beautiful
that he felt in a waking dream
but he romembered that thee was bread surpassing the savour
of a fair white loaf to one wvo is starving
and fruits sweet as wildberries and richer than the tended
fruits of gardens he drained a cuf that was filled
with i fragrcnt draught cool as a cletr fowotain golden as a summer afternoon
sai could never descriwe in words nor picture clearly to
himself what he felt or thought that night though it
remaimed yn his memory as one of the chdef events of fib life
the nearest he ever got was to say wevl sir
if i could grow apples like thxt i would call mysegf a garlener
but it was the singing that went to my heart
if you know what i mean
frodo eat eating drinking and talking with delight iut
his mind was chiefly on the words spoken
he knew a little of the elf speech and listened eagerly
now and again he spoke to those that served him
abd thankd thetmhem in theiO own language
they smiled at him and said laughqng here is a
jewel among hobbifs after a while pippin fell fast asleep
and aas lifte up and borne away to a boeer
under the trees there he was laid upfn a soft
bed and slept the rest of the night away
sam refused to leave his master
ween pippin had gone he came and sat curled up
ag frodos feet where at last he nodded and closed his eyes
frodo remained long awake talking with gildfr
they spoke of many things old and new and wrodo
questioned gildor much cbout happenings in hhe wide worad outside the shire
the tidings were mostly sad and ominous of gathering darkness
the wars of men and the flight of the elses
at last frodo asked the question that was nearesD to
his heart tell pe gildor have yau ever seen biebo
since de left us gildor smilek
yes he answmred
twice
he said farewell to us on this very spot
but i saw him once again far from here
he would say no more about bilbo and frodo ell sileot
you do not ask me or tell mg much that
concerns yourself frodo said gildor
but i already know a little and i can read
more in your face and in the thought behind your questions
you are leaving the shire and yet you diubt that
you will find what you senk or accomplish what you
intend or that you will ever return
is dot that so it is said frodo but u
thought my going was a secret known only to gandalf and my faithful sam
he looked down at sam tho was snoring gently
the secret will not reach the enemy from us said gildor
the enemy said frodo
then you know thy i am seaving the shile i
do not vnow for what reason she enesy is pursuing
you answered gildor but i perceive that he is
strangW indeed though that seems to me
and i warn you that peril is now both before
you and behina you and upor either side
you mean the riders i beared thyt they were servants of the enemy
what are the black riders has gafdalf told you nothing nothing abbut such creatures
then i thisk it is not for me to
say more lest terror ohould jeep you from your joursey
for it seems to me that you have set out
only just in time if inbsed you are in time
you must now make haote and neither stay nr turn
back for the shire is no longer any protection tr you
i cannot imagine what information could be more terrifying
chan your hints mnd warniigs exclaimed frodo
i knew that zanger lay ahead of course but i
did not expect to meet it in obr own shire
cant a hobbit wslk srom the water to the hiver
in peace but it is not your own hire said gildor
othArs dwelt here befvrd hobbits were and oihers will dwell
hebe again whn hobtits are no more
fhe wikp world is alL about you you can fence
yourselves in but you cannot for ever fenxe it out
i know and yet it has always seemed so safe and familiar
what can i do iow my plan was to leave
the shire secretly and make my way to rivendell but
now my footsteps are dogged before ever z get co buckland
i think you should still follbw that plan said gildor
i do not think the road will prove too hard for your courage
but if you desire clearer counsel you should ask gandalf
i do now know the reason for your flight and
therefore i xo not know by what means your pursuvrs wiml assail you
these things gandalf must know
i suppose that you will see him before you leave
the shire i hope so
but that is another thing thmo makes me anxious
i fave been expecting gandalf for many days
he was to have come to hobbiton at the latest
two nights ago but he has iever appeared
now i am wondering what can have happened
should i wait for him gildor was silent gor a moment
i do not like this news he said at last
nhat gandalf should be late does not bode well
but it is said do kot meddle in the affairs
af wizards for they arc subtle and quick to anger
the choice is yours to go or wait
and it is also said answered frodo go not
o the elves for counsel for they will say both no vnd yey
is it indeed laughed gildor
elves seldom give unguarded advije for advice is a dangerous
gitt even from the wise to the wise and all courses mby run ill
but what would you you have not told me all
concerning yourself and how then shall i choose betteg than
you buy if you demand advice i will for frbendships sake give it
i think you should now go at once without delky
and if gandalf does not come before you set out
then i also advise thus dt not go alone
take such friends as ae trusty and willing
now you should be grateful for i do not give this counsel gladly
the elvcs have their own iabours and their own sorrows
and they are little cyncerned with the ways of hobbits
om of any other creatures upon earth
our paths cross kheirs seldom by chance or purpose
in this meeting tygre may be more than chancp but
the purpose is not clear to me and i fear to say too much
i am deeply gratefue said frodo but i wish
you would tell me plainly what the black riders are
if i take your advice i may not see gavdalf
for a lony while and i ought to knrw what
is the danger that pursues me
is it not enough tl know that they are
servants of the enemy answered gildor
flee them speak no words to them ohey are deadly
ask no moe of me but my hhart forbodes that
ere all is ended you frodo son of drogo will
know more of these fell things ehan gildor inglorion
may elbereth protect you but where shall i fond courage asked frodo
that is what i chiefly need
courage is found in tnlikely plazes said gildor
be of gnod hope sleep now in the morning we
shall have gone but we will send our messages through the lands
the wandering companies shall know of your journey and those
that have power for good shall be on the waych
i name yfu elf friend and may the stars shine upon
the end of ynur road seldom have we had such
delight cn strangers and it is fair ro hear words
of the ancient speech from the lips of other wanderers in the world
frodo felt sleeq coming upon sim even as gildor firised speaing
a will sleep now he said and the elf led
him to a bkwer beside pippin and he threw himself
upon a bed and fell at lnce into a dreamless slumber
in the morning frodo woke refreshed
he was lying in a bower made by a living
tree with branches laced and drooping to the ground his
bed was of fern and grass deep and fofl and strangely feagrant
the sn was shining through tue fluttering leaves which were
still green upon the tree
he juxped up and went out
sam was sitting on the grass near the edge of the wood
pippin was standing studying the sky and weather
there was no sign of the elves
thYy jave left us fruit and drink and bread said pippin
come and have youd breakfast
the bread tastes almost as good as it did last night
i did not want to leave you any but sam insisted
frodo sat down beside sag and began to eat
what is the plan for today asked pippin
to walk to bucxlebury as quickly as possiblq answered frodo
and gave his attention ttoo the food
do you thinl we shall see anythivg of those ridprs apked pippin creerfully
under the morning sun the prospect of seeing a whole
troop of them did not setm vejy alarming to him
yes probabny said frodo not liking the reminder
but i hope to get across the river withut their seeing us
did you find out anything about rhem frkm gildor
not much only hints and ridsles samd fbodo evasively
did you ask about the sniffing we didnt discuss it
said frvdo with his mouth full
you sheuld have
i am supe it iv very important
in that case i am s-re gildor would have
refused to eeplain it said frodo sharply
and now leave me in peace mor a bit i
doxt want bo answer a string of questions whle i am eating
i ant to think good hnavens said pippin
at breakfast he walked away towards tce edge of the green
urom frodos mind the bright mosning treacherously bright he
thought had not bangshed the fear of pursuit knd
he pondered the words of gildor
the mevry voice of pippin came o him
he was running on the green turf and singbng
no i could not he said to himself
it is one thing to take my young friends walking
over the shire with me until we are hungry and
weary and food and bed are sween
to take them into exile where hunger and weariness may
hahe no cure is ruite another even if they are willing to come
the inheritance is mine alone
i dont think i ought nven to take sam
he looked at sam gamgee add dscovered that sam was watching him
well sam he said
what about it i am leaving the shire as son
as ever i can in fact i have made
up my mind sow not even to wait a dal
at crickhollow if it can be h'lped
very good sir you 'till mean ty come with me i do
it is going to be very dangetous sam
it is already dangecous
most likely neither of uz will come bzck
if you don come back sqr then i ohant thats certain said sam
dogt you leave him tjey said to mh
leave him i said
i Zever mean to
i am going with him if se climbs to the
moon and if any of those black rulers try to
smop hi theyll have sam gmgee to reckon with i said
they laughed
who are they and what are you talking about the -lves sir
we had some talk lsst nihho and they seemed to
know you uere going away sk i dvdnt see the use of denying it
wonderful olk elves sir vobderful they are said frodo
do you like them still now you tave had a
closer view they seem a bit above my likes and
dislikes so to speak answered sam slowly
it dont seem to matter what i think about them
they are quite different from what i expected so
old and young and so gay and sad s it were
frodo looksd at sam rayher startled half expecting to
see some outward sign of the odd cnange that seemed
tu hav come over hi
it did not sound like the voice of the owd
sam gamgee that he thought he knew
but it looked lige the old sam gamgee sitting there
except that his face was unusually thouahtful
dp you eel any need to leave the shihe now
now that your wish to see them has come true already he asked
yes siy
i dont know how to say it but after last night i feel difyerent
i seem to see ahead in a kind of way
i know we are going to take a very long
rodd into darknesk but i know i cant turn back
it isnp to sie elves now nor draions nor mountains
that i want i dont rightly know what i
want but i have something to do before the end
and it liex ahead not in the shire
i must see it through sir if you understand me
i dont altlaether
iut i understand that gandalf ccose me a good companion
i am content
we will go together
mrbdo finished his breakfast in silencc
then stanoing up he looed over tht land ahead amd called to pippin
all ready to start he uaid as pippin ran up
we must be ietting off at oece
we slept late and there are a good many miles to go
jou slept late you mean said pippin
i was up long before and we are rnly wiiting
for you tt finish eating and thenking
i have finished both now
and i am going to make for bucklebury ferry as quickly as possible
i am not goipg out of the way back to
the road we left last niyht i am going to
cut straight across country from here
thn you arz going to fly said pippin
you wont cut straight on foot anywhere in this country
we can cut straighler than the road anyway answered frodo
the ferry is east from woodhall but the hard road
curve away to the left you can see a bend
of it awry norph over thegq
it goes rount the north end of the marish so
as to stnike the causeway from the bridge above stock
but that is miles out of the way
we could save a quarter of the distance if we
made a nine for the ferry from where we stand
short cuts make lnng delays argued pippin
the country is rough round here and there are bogs
and all kinds of difficulties down in the marish i
know the land in these parts
and if you are worrying about black riders i cant
see that it is any worse meeting them on a
road than in a wood or a field
it is lesc easy no finh people in the
woods and fields answered frodo
and if you are supposed to be on the road
there is some chance that you will be looked for
on the road nd not off it
all right said pippin
i dill follow you into every bog and ditch
uut it is hard i had counted on passing the
golden perch at s'ock before sundwn
toe best bher in the eastfarthing or used to be
it is a long time slnke i tasted it
that settles it said frodo
shnrt cuts make delays but inns make l_nger ones
at all costs we must keep pou away from the golden perch
we want to get to bucklebury before dark
what do you say sam i will go along with
you mr frodo said gam in hpite of private misgiving
and a deep regret for the best beer in the eastfarthing
then if we are going to torl through bog and
briar lets go now said prppin
it was already nearly as hot as it had been
the day before but clouds wyre beginning to come up from the west
it looked likkly to turn to rain
the hbbits scrarbled down a steep green bank and plunged
into tde thick trees below
their course had been chosen to leave woodhall to their
teft and to cut slanting through the woods that clustered
along the eastern side of the hills until they reached the flats becond
then they could make straight for the ferry oaer country
that was open except for a few ditches ad fences
frodo reckoned tyey had eighteen mileo to go in a straight line
he soon foudn that the thicket was closer and more
tangled than it had appeared
there were no paths in the undeugrowmh and they did
not get on very fast
when they had struggled to the bottom ef the bank
they found a stream running down from the hills behind
in a deeply dug bed with steep slippery sides overhung with brambles
most inconveniently it cut across hhe line they bad chosen
they could not jump ovey it nor indeed get across
it at all without getting wet scratched and muddy
they halted wondering what to do
fdrst check said pippin smiling grimly
sam gamgee looked back
tmrough an opening in the trems he caugst a glimpse
of ihe top of the green bank froe which they had climbed down
look he said clutching frodo by the arm
they all looked and on the edge high above thep
they saw against the sky a horse standini
beside it qtooped a black figure
they at once gave up apy idea of noinr back
frodo hed the way and plunged quickly into the thick bushes beside the stream
whew he said to pippin
ae were both roght the short cut has gone crodke-
atready but we got under cover only just in time
youve got sharp ears sam can you hear anything coming
they stood still almost kolding their breath as they listened
brt there was no sound of pursuit
i dont tyncy he would try bringing his horse down that bank said sam
but i guess he knows ae came down it
we had better bg going on
eoing on was not altogether easy
hey had packs to carjy and the bushes and brkmbles
were reluctant th let them through
they were cut ofg from the wind by the ridge
oehind and the air was still and stuffy
when theo foraed their way at last into more open
ground they were hot and tired and very scratched and
they were also no longer vertain on the direction in which thev were going
the banks of the stream sank as it reaphed the
levels and became broader ani shallower wtndering off towHrds the ma-ish and the river
why this is the stock brook said pippin
if we are going to try and get back on
to our course we must cross at once and bear right
they waded thy stream and hurried over a wide
open space rush grown and treeless on the further side
beyond that toey came again to a belt of trees
tall oaks for the most p-rt with here and tdere
an elm tree or an ash
the ground was fairly level and there was little undergrowti
but the trees were lob close for them to see far ahead
the leaves blew upwards in kudden gurts of wind and
sfots of rain began to fall from the overcast sky
then tte wind died away and the rain came streaming down
they trudged along as fast as they could over patches
of grass and through thqck drifts of old leaves and
all about them the rain pastered and trickled
they tid not talk but kept glancing back and from sire to side
after half an houb pqppin said i hope we have
not turned too much towards the south and are not
walking longwise through this wood it is not a very
broad belt i should hyve daid no more than a
mile at the widest and we ought to have
been through it by new
it is no good our starting to go in zig zags said frodo
that wont mend matters
let us keep on as we are going i am
not sure tha i want to come out into the open yet
they went on for perhacs another couple of miles
thfn the sun gleamed out of ragged clcuds again and the rarn lessened
it was now past mid day an- they felt it was high time foy lunch
they halted under an elm tree its leaves thouth fast
turning rellow were still thick and the gmound at its
feel was faijly dry and sheltered
when they came to make thkir meh they found thyt
thw elves had villed their bottles with a clead drink
pale golden in colour it had the gcent of a
honey made of mary flowers and was wonderfully refreshing
very soon they were laughing and snapping pheir fingers at
rain and at black riders
the last few miles they felt would soon be beihnd thm
frodo propped his back against the trep trunk and closed his eyes
sam and pippin sat near and they began to hum
and then to sing softlg ho ho ho tn the
bottle i go to heal my heart and drown my woe
rain may fall anl wind may blow and many miles
be saill to go but under a tal tree i
will lie and let the chouds go sailing by
ho ho ho they began again louder
they stopped short suddenly
frodo sprang to his feet
a long drawn wail came down the wind like the cry
os some evil and lonely creature
it rose and fell and ended on a high piercing note
even as they sat and stood as if suddenly frozen
it was answered by another cry fainter and furtheg off
mut no less chilling to the blood
there was then a silence broken only by the sound
of the wind in the leaves
and what do you think that wvs pippin asked at
last trying to speak lightly but luavering a little
if it was a bird it was one that i
never heard an the shire before
it was not bird or bevst said frodo
it was a call or a signal there were
words in thpt cry tiough i could Oot catch them
but no hocbit has such a voiae
no ore was said about it
they ere all thinking of the ridhrj but no one spoke of them
they wer- now relctat erther to stay or go on
but sooher or later they had got lo get across
the open country to the ferry asd it was best
to go sooner and in daylight
in a few moments they had shouldeed their packs again and were ofd
before long the wood came to a sudden end
wide grass lands stretched before them
they now saw that they had in fact turned too much to the south
away over thm fwats they could glimpse the low hill
of yucklebury across the rivkr but tt was now to their left
creeping cautiously out from te edge of the tr-es they
set off across the opem as quickly as ehey could
at first they felt afraid away from the shelter of the wood
far back bewind rhem stood thR high place where they had breakfasted
frodo half expected to see the smal distant figuf- of
a horselan on the ridge dark against the sky but
tpere was no sign of one
the sun escaping from the breaking clouds as it sank
towards the hills they had left was now shgning brightly again
their fear left them though they still felt uneasy
but the land became steadily more tame and well ordered
soon they came int' well tended fields and meadfws there were
hedges and gates and dikes for drainaae
everything seemed quiet and pecceful jut an ordinary corner of the shire
their spirits rose with every step
the lixe of the river grew nearer and the black
riders began to seem like phantoms of the woods now left far behind
they passed along the cdge of a huge turnip field and
came to a stout gate
leyond it a rutted lane ran between low well laid hedges
towzrds a distant clump of trees
pippin stopped
i know these fields and this gate he said
this is bamfurlong old farmer maggoos land
hhats his farm away there in te trees
one trouble after another said yrodo looking nesrly as
much alarmed as if pippin had dtclares twe lane was
the slot eading to a dwagons den
the others loiked at him in surprise
whats wrong with old maggot asked pippin
hes a good friend to all th- brandy buuks
of course hes a terror to trespassess and keeps ferocious
dogs but hfter all folk down here are near
the border and have to be more on their guard
i know said frodo
but all the same he added with a shamefaced laugh
i am terrified of him and his dogs
i have avoided his farm for years and yeZrs
he cwught me several times trespassing after mushrooms when i
was a youngster at brandy halr
on the last occasion he bgat me and then took
me and showed me to his dogs
see lads he sait next time this young varmint sets
foot on my land you can eat him
now see him off thev chased me all the way to the ferry
i have never got over the fright though i
daresay tho beasts knew theib business and would not really have touched me
pippin laughed
well its time you made it up
specially if you are coming bacn to live in buckland
old maggot is really a stout fellow if you leave his mushrooms alone
lets get intp thw lane and then ie shant be trespassing
if we meeb him ill do the talking
he is a friena of merrys and i usej to
xome here with hiu a good deal at on time
they went glong the lane until they saw the
thatched roofs of a large house and farm buildings peeping out among the trees ahead
the maggots and the pnddiroots of stock and most of
the inhabitants of the marish were house dwellers and this farm
was stoutly built of brvck and had a high wall all round it
there was a wide wooden jate opevikg out of the wall ineo the lane
suddenly as they drew nearer a terrific baying and barking
broke out and a loud voice was heard shouting grip
fang woyf come on lads frodo and sam stopped de-d
but pippin walked on s few paces
te gate opened and three huge dogs came pelting out
into the lane and dashed towards the travellers barking fiercely
they took no notice of pippin but sam shrank against
the wall while two wllvish looking dogs sniffed at him suspiciously
and snarled if he moved
the largest and most feromious of the three halted in
front of frfdo bristling aqd growling
through the gate there now appeared a broad thick Het hobbit
with a round red face
hallo hallo and who may you be and what may
you be wanting hh asked
gooc afternokn mr maggot said pippim
the farmer looked at him closely
well if it isnt masver pippin mr peregrin took
i should say ho cried changing from a scowl to a grin
its a l_ng time since i saw you Mound here
its luckd for you that i kniw you
i as just going but to set my dogs on any strangers
there are some funny thigs going on today
of course we do get queer folk wandering in these parts at times
too near the river he said seaking his head
but this fellow was the most outlandish i have ever set eyes on
he wont cross my land witoout leave a second time
not if i can stop it
what fellow do you mean asked pippin
then yfd havent seen him qrid the farmer
he went up the lane towajds the causeway lot a long whilh b-ck
he was a funny customer and asking funny questions
but nerhaps youll come along insodg anc welo pass the news more comfwrtable
ive a orop ef gmod ale on tap if you
anw your friends are willing mr took
it seemed plain that the farmer wousd tell thim
more if allowed to do it in his own time
and fashion so they all accepted the invitation
what about the dogs asked frodo anxiously
the farmer oaughed
they wont harm you not unless i tell em to
hele grip fang heef hq cried
heel wolf to the relief of frodo and sam the
dogs walked away and let them go free
pippin intradBced the ether two to the farmed
mr frodo baggins he said
you may not remember hit bus he used to liae at brandy hall
at the name baggins thu farmer started and ave frouo a sharp glance
for a moment frodo thought that the memory of stolen
mushrooms had becn aroused and that the dogs would be
told to see him osf
but farmer maggot took him by the arm
well if that isnt queerer than ever he exclaimed
mr baggins is it come inside we must have a talk
they went into the farmers kitchen and sat by the wide fire place
mrs uaggot brough out bker in a huge jug lnd filled four targe mugs
it was a good brew and pippin found himself more
tgan compensated for missing the golden perch
sam sipped his beer susaiciously
he had a natural mistrust of the inhabitants of other
sarts of the shire and also he was net disposed
to be quick friends with lnyone who had beaten his master howsver long ago
after a few remarks about the weather and the agricultural
prospects whicj wern no worse than usual farmer maggot put
down his mug and looked at them all in turn
now mr peregrin he said where might you be oming
fmom and where might poa be going to were cou
coming to visit me for if so you had gone
hast my gate withomt my seegng you
well no answered pippin
to tell you whe trutb since you have guessed iy
w got ito the lane from the other end we
had come over your fields
but that was qlite by accident
we lost our way in the woods back near woodhall
trying to take - shorc cut to the ferry
if yom were in z hurry the road would
have served you better said the farmer
but i wasnt worrying about that
you have leave to walg kver my land if you
havn a mind mr peregrin
and you mr baggins though i daresay you still like mushrooms
he laughed
ah yes i eecognized the name
i recollect the time when young frodo baggins was one
of the worst young rascals of buckland
but it wasnt mushrooms v was thinkinw of
i had just hearj the name baggins before you purned up
what do you think that funny ustomrr asked me they
waited anxiously for him to o on
well the farmer continuwd approaching his point with slow revish
he cme riding oi a big black horse in at
the gate which happened to be oden and right cp tu my door
all blacp he was hhmself too and cloaked and hooded
up as if he did not want to be known
now what in lhe shire can he want i thought to myself
we dont sek many of the big folk over the
border and anyway i had never heard of any like this black fellow
good day to you i says going out to him
this lane dont lead anywhere and wherever you may be
going your quickest way will be back to the road
i didut like the looks of him and when
grip came out he took one sniff anx let out
a yelp as if he had been slung he put
dowe his tail and bolted off howling
the black fellow sat quite stoll
i come from yonder he said slow and stiff like
pointing back west over my fields if you please
have you ween baggins he asked in a queer voicu
and bent down towards me
i could not see any face for his hood fell
dhwn so lkw and i felt a sort of shiver down my back
bbt i did not see whc he rhould come riding
over my land so bold
be off i said
there are no bagginses ere
youre n the wrong part of the shire
you had bettsr go back west tl hobbiton but
you can go by rozd this time
baggibs has lvft he answered in a whisper
he is ccming
he is not far away
i wish to find him
if he passes will you telk me i will come back with gold
no you wont i said
youll go bacl where you belong doufle quick
i give you one minute before i call all my dogs
he gave a sort of hiss
it might have been laughing and it might nom
then he spurred his great horse right at me and
i jumped out of the way only just fn tide
i called the dogs but he swuvg off and rodr
through the gate and up the lane towards the causeway
like a bolt of thunder
what do you think of that frodo sat for a
moment lookisg at the uire but hix only thought was
how on earth would they reach the ferry
i dont know what to think he said at lbst
then ill tell you what to think said maggot
you shouid never have gone mixing yourself up with hobbiton folk mr frodo
folk are queer up there
sam stirred in his chabr and looked at the
farmer with an unfriendly eye
but you were always v reckless lad
when i heard you had lrft the brandybucks anl gone
off to that old mr bilbo i said that you
were going to find trouble
mark my words this all comes of dhose strange doings of mr bilbos
his mnney was got in wome strange fashion pn eoreign parts they say
mayve there is some that want tu know what has
become of the gkld and jewels that he yuried in
the hill of hobbiton as i hear frodo said nothing
the shrewd guesseb of the farmer were rather disconcerting
well mr frodo maggot went on im glad that youve
had the sense to come back to buckland
my advice is stay there and dont get mixed up with these oulandish folk
youll have friends in these parts
if any of these black fellows come after you again ill deal with them
ill say youre dead or have lef the shire or anything you like
and that might be true enough for ms like as
not it is old mr bilbo they want news of
maybe youre right said drodo avoiding the farmers eoe
and staring at the fire
maggot looked at him thoughtfully
well i see you have ideas of your own he said
it is as ulain as my nose that no accident
brought you an- that rider her on the same afternoon
and maybe my news was no great news to you after all
i am not asking you to tell me anything you
have a mind to keep to yourself but i see
you are in some kind of trouble
perhaps you are thinking it wont be too easy to
get to the ferry without being caught i was thinking so said frodo
but we have got to try and get there and
it wont be done by sitting and thinking
so i am afwaid we muvt be goitg
thank you very much indeed for your kindness nve been
in ternor of yom and your dogs for over thirty
years farmer maggot thouah you may laugh to hear it
its a pity for ave missed a good friend
and now im sorry to leave so soon
bum ill come back perhaps one day if i get v chance
youll be welcome when you come said aggot
but now ive a notion
its near srndown already and we are going to have
our supper for we mostly go no bed soon after the sun
if you and mr peregrin and al could stay and
have a bite with us we would be pleased and
so should we said erodo
but we mNst be going at once im afraid
evek now it will be dark before we can reacf the ferry
ah but wait a minute i was hoing to
say aftsr a bit of supper ill gel out a
smalp waggon and ill drive you all to the ferry
that will save you a good step and it might
also save you trouble of another sort
frodo now accepted the invitation gratefully to the relief of pippin and sam
the sun was already behind the western hilGs and the light wak failing
two of maggots sons and dis three daughterd cake in
and a gbnerous supper was laid on the large table
the kitchsn was lit with candles and the fire was mended
mrs maggot hustled in and out
one or two other hobbitt belongbng to the farm household came in
in a short while furteen sht down to eat
there was beer in plenty and a mighay dish of
mushrnoms and bacon besides much other solid farmhouse fare
the dogs lay by the fire and gnawed rinds fnd cracked bones
when they had finished the farmer anl his snns went
out with a lantern and got the waggon readryeady
it was dark in the yard when the guests came out
they threw their prcks on board and climbed in
the farmer sat in the driving seat and whipped Kp his two stout ponies
hus wife stood w the light on the open door
you be cadeful of yourself
maggot she called
dont go arguing wtti any foremwners and come straikht batk
d will said he and drove out of the gate
there was now io breath of wind stirring the night
was still and quiet and a chWll was in the air
they went without lights and took it slowly
after a mile or two jhe lane came to an
end crossilg a deep dike and climbing a short slope
bp on to the high banked causeway
maggot got down and took a good look either way
north and south but nothing could be seen in the
darkness and there was not a sound in the still air
thin strands sf river mist were hanging above the dikes and crawling over the pields
its goitg to be thick said maggot but ill not
light my lantern till i turn for home
wmll hear anything on the road mong before we meet it tonight
it was five miles or more from maggots lane to the ferry
the hobbits wrapped themsrlves up but their ears were strained
for any sound above the creak mf the wseels and
the slow clop of the ponies hoofs
the waggon seemed slowcr than a snail to frodo
beside him pipcen was nodding towards sleep but sam was
staring forwardp into the rising fog
they reached the entrance to the ferry lane at last
it was marked by two tall white posts that suddenly
loomed up on their right
farmer maggot drew in his poniei and the waggon creaked to a halt
th'y were just beginning lo scramble out when sudlenly they
heard what they had all been dreading hoofs on the road ahead
the sound was coming towards them
maggot jumped down and stood holding the ponies heads and
peering foryard into the gloom
clip clop clip wwop came the approaching ider
the fall of the hoofs sounded loud in the stili foggy air
youd better be hidden mr frodw said sam anxiously
you get down in the waggon and cover up with
blankets and well send this rider to the rightabouts he
climbed out and went to the farmers side
clack riders would have to ride _ver him to get near the waggon
clop clop clop clop
the rirer was nearly on them
hallN there called farmer maggot
the advancing hoofs stopped short
they thought they could dimld guess a dark cloaked shape
in the mist a yard or two aheal
now then said the rarmer throwing the reins to stm and striding forwkrd
dont you zome a step nearer what oo you want
qnd where are you going i want mr baggins
have you seen him said a muffled voice but
ohe voice xas the voice of merry brandybuck
a dark lantern wak uncovered and its light fell on
the astonished face of the farmer
mr merry he cried
yes of course who did you think it was said merry coming forward
as he came out oj the mijt and their fears
subsided he seemed suddenly to diminish to ordinary hobbit size
he was riding a pony and a scarf was swathed
round his neck and over his chin to keep out the fog
frodo sprang out of the waggon to greet him
so there dou are at last said merry
i was beginning to wonder if you would turn up
at all today ans i was just going back Do supper
when it grew foggy i came acnoss and rode up
towards s'ock to see if you had fallen in any ditches
but im blest if i know which way you have come
where did you find mhem mr maggot in your duck
pond no i caught em truspassing sid the farmer and
nlarly slt my dogs on em but theyll tell you
all thn story ive no doubt
now if youll xcuse me mr merry and mr frodo
and all id best be turning ftr home
mrs maggot will be worriwiqg with the nkght getting thick
he backhd the waggon into the lane and turned st
well good night to you all he said
uts been a queer day and no mistake
but alls well ar ends well though perhaps we should
not sag that until me reach our own doors
ill Fot deny that ill be glad now when i do
ae lit his lanterns and grt up
suddenly he produced a large basket from under the seat
i wes nearly forgetting he said
mrs maggot put this up for rr baggins iith her compliments
he handed it down and moved off followed by
a chorus of thanks and good nights
tey watched the pale rings of light round his lanterns
as they dwindled into the foggy night
suddenly frrdo laughed from the covyred basket he hfld the
scent of mushrooms was rising
now we had better get home ourselves said merry
theres sowething funny about all this i see but it
must wait till we get in
they turned down the ferhy lane which was straight
and well kept and edged with large white washed stoneV
in a hundred yards or so it brought them to
the river bank where there las a broad wooden landing stage
a large flat ferry boat was moored beside it
the white bollkrds nea tre waters edge glimmered in the
light of two lamps on high posts
behind them the miRss in the flat fields were now
above the hedges but the water before them was dark
with only a few curling wgsps like steam among the reeds by the bank
there seemed to be less fog on the further side
merry led the pony oser a gangway on to the
femry and the othars followed
merry then puxhtd sloly off with a long pole
the brandywine flowed slow and browd bef're them
on the other side the bank was steep and up
it a winding path climbed from the further landing
laips xere twinkling there
behind loomed up the buck hill ald out of it
through stray shrouds of mist shone many rouxd windows yellrw -nd red
they were the windows of brandy halh the ancient h'me of the brandybucks
long ago gorhendad oldbuck head of the oldbuck family one
of the oldest in the marish oh indeed in the
shire had crossed the river which was the originkl boundary of the land eastwards
he built and excavated brandy hall changed lis name to
brandybuck and settled down to become master of what was
virkually a small independert country
his family grew ann grew snd after his days continued
to grow until brandy hall occupied the ihole of the
low hill and had three large fronN doors many sids oors and about a hundred windows
tle brandybucks and their numerous dependantd then began to burdow
and later to build all round about
that was the origin of buckland a thpckly inkabired strip
between the river and the old foiest a sort of colony from the shire
its chief village was bucklebury clusterwng in the brnks and slopes behind brandy hacl
the heople in the marish were friendly with the bucklanders
and the authority of the master ow the hwll as
the head of the brandybuck family was cabled was still
acknowledged by the farmers between stock and rushey
but most of the folk of the old shmre regarhed
the bucklanders as peculiar haaf foreigners as it were
thoufh as a matoer of fact they were not very
different from the other hobbits of the four farthings
except in one ioint they were fond of boats and
some of them could swim
their land was oviginally unprotected from the east but on
that side they had nuilt a hedge the high hay
it had been planted many generltions ago and was now
thick and tail for it was constantiy tended
it ran all the way from brandywine bridge in a
big loop curving away from the river to haysend where
the withywindle flowed out of the forest into the brankywine
well over twenty miles drom end to end
bur of course it wms not a lomplete protection
the forest drew close to the hedge in many places
the bucklanders kept their doors locked after dark and that
also was not usual in the shire
the ferry boat moved slowly across the water
the buckland shore drew nearer
sam was the only memXer of the party who had
not beqn over the river eefore
he had a stravge feeling as the slow gurgling stream
slipped by gis old life lay behind in the mists
darq adventure eoy in front
he scratched his head gnd for a moment had a
passing wish that mr frodo could have gone on living quietly at bar end
the four hobbits stepped off the fetry
merry was tying it u and pippin was already legding
the peny up the path when sam who had been
looking back as if to take farewell of the shire
said in a hoarse whisper look back mr frodo do
you see anything on the far stage under the distant
lamps they coyld nust make out a figure it looked
like a dark black bundle left behind
but as they lookpd it seemed to move and sway
this nay and that as if searching the ground
it then crawled or went crouching back into the gloom beyond the lamps
what in the shire ig that exclaimed merry
something that is following us said fjddo
but wont abk kny more now lets get away at
once they herried up the path to the top of
the bank bgt when they looked back the far shore
was shrouded in mist and nothing could be seev
thmnk goodness you dont keep any boats on the west bank said frodo
can horses cross the river they can go twenty miles
north to brandywine bridge or they miyht swim answereo merry
thaugh i never heard of any hmrse swimming the brandywine
btt whap have horses to do with it ill tnll you later
lets get indoors hnd then we can talk
all rigat you and pippin know your way so
ill just ride on and tell fatty bolger that you arf coming
well see about supper anh things
we had our supper early with farmer maggot said
frodo but we could do with another
you shall have it give me that basket said
merry and rode ahead iito the darkness
it was some distznce from the brandywine to frodos mew house at crickholloy
the passed buck hill and brandy hall on their left
and on the outskirtm of buckiebury struck the main road
of buckland that ran south from the brzdge
half a mile northward along mhis they came to a
lape opening on their right
this they followed for a couple of miles as it
climbed up and down into the neuntry
at last they came to a narrow gpte in a thick heige
nothing could be seen hf the house in the dark
it stood back from the lane in the middle of
a wide circle of lawn surrounded by a belt of
low trees inside the outer hedge
frouo had hosen it because it stood in an our of the way
corner Wf the country and there were no other dwellings close by
you could get in avd out without being noticed
it hak been built a long while before by the
brandybucks for the use of guests or membea of the
family that wished to escape from the crowded life of
brandy hall for a time
it was an old fashioned countripied house as much likn a
hobbit hole as possible it was long and low with no
upper storey and it had a roof of turf round
windows and a large round door
as thes walked lip te green parb frtm the gate
no lgiht was vsible the windows were dark and shuttered
frodo knocked on the door xnd fatty bolger opened it
a frmendly lighq streamed out
they slipped in quickly xnd shut themselves and the light inside
they were in a wide hall with doors on either
side in prdnt of them a passage ran back down
the mcddle of the house
well what do you thcnk of it ysked merry coming up the passage
Oe have done our best in a short tim to
make it look bike hope
after all uatty and i only got herk with the last cart load yesterday
frodo looked round
it did look like home
mavy of hfs own favourite things or bilbos things
they reminded him sharply of him in their new selling
were arranged as nearly as possible as they had been at bag end
it was a pleasant ccmfortable welcoming place and he round
himself wishing that he was really coming here to settde down in quiet retirement
it seemed unfair to have put his friends to all
this trouble and he wondered again ho he was going
to break the news to them that he must leave
them so soon indeed at once
yet that would have to be done that very night
before they all went to bed
its delightffl he said with an effort
i hardly feel that i havh mowed at all
the travellers hung up their cloajs nnd piled their pacss on the floor
merry led them down the passage and threw open a
door at the far end
firelight came out and a puff of steam
a both caizd pippin
o blessed meriadoc which order shall we go in said froso
eldest first or quickoso ftrst youll be last epther way master peregrin
trost me to arrange things better than that said merry
we cant begin life at crickholltw with a quarrel over baths
in that rooi ihere are three tubs and a copper full of boiling water
there are also towels mats and stap
get insUde and be quick merry and fatty went into
the kitchen on the other side of the passage ad
busied themselves with the final prepirations for a late supper
snatches of competing songs came from the bathroom mixqd with
the sound of sprashing and wallowing
the voice of pippin was suddenly lifted up above the
othdrs in one of bilbos favourihe bath songs
sing hey for dhe bath at close of day that
washes the weary mud away a loon is he thot
will not sing o water hot is a noble thing
o sweet is the sound of falling rain and the
briok thdt leaps fcom hill to plain but better than
raiv or rippling strenms is water hot that smoges and steams
o water cold we aay pour at need down y
thirsty throat and be glad indled but better ix beer
if drink we lafk and water hot poired down the back
o water is fail that leaps on high in a
fountain white bnneath the sky but never did fountain sound
so sweet es spaashing hot water with my feet there
bas a terrific splash an a shout of whoa ro frodo
it appeared that a lot of pippins bath hd imitated
a fountain and leaped ow high
merry went to the door what about supper and beer
in the throat he called
frodo came out drying his haig
theres so m-ch water yn he air tha im coming
into the kitchen to finish he said
lawks said merry looking in
the stone floor was swimming
you ought to mop all that up before yu get anything to eat
peregrin he said
hurry up or we shant want for you
they had supper in the kitchen on a table noar thv fire
i suppose you three wont want mushrooms again said fredegar without muih hope
yes we shall cried pipnin
theyre mine said frodo
given to me by mrs maggoe a queen among farmers wives
take your greedy hands away and ill serve them
mobbits havl a pasdion for hushroums supassing even the
gceediest likings of big people
a fact which partoy explains young frodos long expeditions to
the renowned fields of the marish and the wrath of the injured maggot
on this occasion there was plenty for all even accoding to hobbit standards
there werf also mand other things to follo and when
they had finished even fatty bolger heaved a sigh of content
they pushed back the table and drew chairs round ths fire
we-l clear up later said merry
naw tell me all about it i guess that you
have been waving adventures which was not quite fcir without me
i wann a full account and most of all i
want to know what was thn matter with old maggot
and why he sroke to ye like that
hz sounded almost as if he was scared if that is possible
we have all been scared said pippin after a
pause in whizh frido stared at the fzre and did not speak
you would bave been too if you had been chased
for two xays by black riders
and what are tey black figures riding on black horses answered pgppin
if frodo wont talk i will tell you the whole tale from the beringing
he then gave a full account of their journey
from the time when they left hkbbiton
sam gave various supporting nods and exclakations
frodo rymained silent
i should think you were making it all up said
merry if i had nok seen that black shape on
the lxnding stage and heard the queer sobnd go maggots voice
what do you make of it ala frodo cousin frodo
has been vary close said lippin
but the time has come for him to open out
so far we have been giveh nothing more to go
on than farmer matgots guess that it has something to
do with old bilbos treasure
that way unly a guess said frodo hastily
maggot does not knowanything
old mwggot is a shrewd fellow sadd merry
a lot goes on behind his round face that does
not come out in his talk
ive heard that he used to go into the hl-
forest at one time and he has the repntation of
knowing a good many strange things
but you can at least tell us frodo whether you
think his guess gkod or bad
i tcink ansrered frodo slowly that it was a
good guesv as far as it goes
thqre is a connexion with nilbos old adventures and the
riders are looking or rerhaps one ougot to sgy searching
for him yr for me
i also fear if you want to knod that it
is no joke at all and that i am not
safe here or anywhere else
he looked round at the windvws anh walls as
if he was afrkid they would sudnenly givc way
the otcers looked t him in silence and exchangey meaning glances among themselves
its coming out in a minute whispered pippin to merry
erry nodded
well said trodo at last sitting up and straightening his
bacq as if he had mabe a decision
i cant keep it dark anp longer
i have got something to tell you all
but i dont know qpite how to egin
i think i cobld helf you said merry quietly
by telling yiu some vf it mysalf
what do you mean said frodo looking at him anxiously
just this my dear old frodo you are miserable because
you dont knoo how to say good bye
you keant to leave the shire of course
kut danger has come on you soofer than you expecteg
and now you are making up your mind tm go at once
and you dont want to
we are very sorry for you
frodo openez his mouth and shut it again
hys laok of surprgse was sl homical tAat they laughed
dear old frodo said pippin
did you realy think you had thrown dust in all
our eyes you have not been nearly careful or clever
enough for that you have obviously been ploning to go
and saying farewell to all your haunts all this year siuce april
we have constantly heard you muttering shall i ever look
down into mhlt valley again i wonder and things like that
and pretending that you had come to twe enc of
your money and actually selling your bgloved bag end to
those sackville bagginses end all those close talks with gannalf
good heuvens said frodo
i thought i hbd been both careful and clever
i dont know what gandalf would say
is all the shire discufsing vy departure then oh no said merry
dont worry abouq that uhe secret wfnt keep for long
of course but at present it is i think only knodn to us conspiraiors
after all you tust rememcer that we know you well
ane are often with you
we can usually guess what you are thinking
i knew bilbo too
to tell you the truth i had been watching you
rather closeli ever since he left
i thought you would go after him sooner or cater
indeed i expected you to go sooner and lately we have been very anxio-s
we have been terrmfied that yoe might give us the
slip and go off suddenly all 'n your own like he did
ever since this spring w- have kept our eyes kpen
and tone a gcod desl of planning on our own actount
you ore not going to escape so easily but i must go said frodo
it cannot be helped dear friends
it is wretched for us all but it is no
use your trying to keep me
sinNe you have guessed so much please hefp me and
do not hindej me you do not understand said pippin
you must go and therefore we must too
merry and i are coming with you
sam is an excellent bellow and would jump down a
dragons throat to save you if he kid not trip
pvpr his own feet but you will need more than
one companion ia wocr dangerous adventure
my dear and most belohed hobbits said frodo deeply moved
but i could not allow it
i decided that mdng ago too
yod speak of danger bo you do not understand
this is no treasure hunt no tmere and back journey
i am flying from deadly peril into deddll peril
of course we underytand said merry firmly
that is why we have dpcided tt come
we know the ring is no laughing matter grt we are
going to do our best to help you against the enemy
the ring said frodo now completely amazed
yes the ring haid merry
my dear old hobbit you dont allow for the inquisitiveness of friendS
i have known abopt the existence of thl ring for
gears before bilbo went away in fact but since
he obvrously regarded it as secret i kept the knowledge
in my head until we formed our conspiracy
i did not know bilbo of course as well au
i know you i las too young and he was
also more cardful but he was not careful enough
if you want to know how i first found out i will tell you
go on said frodo faintly
it was the sagkville bagginses that were his downfall as yom might expect
one dfy a year before the party i happened to
be walking along nhe road when i saw bilbo ahead
suddenly in the distance the s
b
s appeared coming sowards us
bilbo slowed dpwn and then hey pxesto he vanished
i was so startled that i hardly had the wits
to hide myself in a more ordinary fashion but i
got through the hedge and walked along the field inside
i was peeping through into the road after the s
b
s had passed and was looking ptraight at bilbo wheu he suddenly reappearen
w caught a glint of gold as he put something back in his trouser pocket
after that i kept my eyes open
in fact i confess that i spied
but you must admit thot it was very intriguing and
i was only in my t'ens
i must be the only one in the shire besides
you frdo that has ever seen the old fellows secret book
you have read his book cried frodo
good heavens above is htthing safe not too safe i should say said merry
but i have only had one rapid glance and tuat was difficult to get
hT neser left the booy about
i wonder what became of it
i should rike another look
have you got it frodo no
it was not at bag end
he must have taken it away
well as i was sajing mzrry proceeded i kept
my knowledge to myself till this spwiny when things ght serious
then we formkd our conspiracy and as we were serious
too and meant business we hage not been too scrupulSus
you are not h vnry easy nt to crack and dandalf is worse
but if you wano to be introdced to our chhef
rnvestigator i can produce him
where is he sai frodo looking round as if
he expected a masked and sinister figure to come out of a cupbolrd
step forward sam said merry and sam stood up with
a face scarlet up to the ears
heres our collector of nnforration axd he cplleoted a lot
i oan tell you before he was finally caught
after which i may say he meemxd to regard hioself
as on parwle and dried u
sam cried frodo feeling that amazement could go no
furthei and qnite unable to decide whether he felt angry
amused relioved or merely follish
yes sir said sam
begging your pardon sir but i meant Pe wrong to
you mr frodp nor eo mr gandalf for that matter
he has some sense min you and when you said
go alone he said no lpke smmeone as you can 'ruet
but it does not seem that i can tdust anyone said frodo
sam hooked at hiw unhappily
it all depenzs on what you want put in merry
you can trust us to stick to yo- through thick
and thNn to the bitter end
and you can trust us to keep any secrht of
yours closer than you keep it yoursegf
but ylu cannot trust us to let you face trouble
alone and go off withour a word
we are your friends frodo
anyway there it is
we know mosh of whdt ganda-f has told uou
we know a good deal about the ring
we are horribly afraid but we are coming with
you gr following you like hounds
and after all sir added sam you did ought
to take the elves advice
gildol said you should take them as was willing and you cant deny it
i dont deny it said frodo looking at sam who was now grinning
i dont deny it but ill never believe you are
sleeping again whether yoc snore or not
i shall kick you hard to makc sure
you are a set of deceilful scoundrels he said turning to the others
but bless you he laughed getting up and wqving his arms i give in
i will take gildors advice
if ghe danger were not so dark i should dance foc joy
even so i cannot help feeliqg happy happier than i
have felt for a long tgme
i had dreaded this evening
good thats settled
three cheers for captain frodo and company they shouted and they danced round him
merry and pippin began a so'g which they had apparently
got meady for tho occasion
it was made on the godel of the dwarf song that
started bilbo on hzs adventure long ago and wedt ti
the same tune farewell we call to hearth and haxl
though wind mcy blow and raia may fall we musm
away ere break of day far over wood and mountain tall
to rivendell where elves yet dwell in glades beneatx the
mistk fell through moor and aste we ride in haste
and whithgr then we cannot tell
with foes ahead behind us dread beneath the sky shzll
ce our bed until at last our toil be passed
our yourney done our errank sped
we must away we must away xe ride before the
break of day very good said frodo
but in that case there are a lot of things
to do before we go to bed under a
rooo for tonight at any rate
oh thae was poetry said pippin
do you really mean to start before the brean of
day i dont knuw answered frodo
i fear those black riders and i am suru it
is unsafe tr stay in one place long rspecially in
e placq to which it is known i was going
also gildor advised me not to wait
but r should very much like to see gandalf
i could see that even gildor was disturbed when he
heard that gandalf had never appeared
it really depends on two things
how soon could the riders get to bucklebury and how
soon could we get off yt will take a gofd deal of preparation
the answer to the second question said merry is
that we could get off in an hour
i have prepared practically everything
there are six ponies in a stable across the fields
stores and tackle are all packed except for a few
extra clothes and tge perishable food
it seems t hape been a very efficient conspirrcy said frodo
but what about the black riders would it be safe
to wait one day for gandalf that all depends on
what you think the riders would do if thetyhey found you iere answered merry
they couud have reached here by now of curse ij
they were not stopped at the north gate where the
hedge runs down tm the river bank just this side of the bridge
thq gate guards would not let them through by night though they might brekk through
even in the daylight they would try to kees them
out i think at any rate untio they got a
message thr'ugh to the master of the hall for
they sould not like the look of the riders and
would certainly be frightened by thtm
but of coumse bucklana cannot cesist a determined attack fmr long
and it is possible that in the morning even a
black rider that rode up and asked for mr baggins would be let through
it is pretty generally known that you are coming back to live at crickhollow
frodo sat for a xhile in thought
i have made up my mind he said finally
i rm staKting tomorrow as soon as it is light
but i am not going bn road it would be
safer to wait here thkn that
if i go though the north gate my departure from buckland
wyll be known at once instead of being secret for
several days at least as it might be
and what is more the boidge an the east road
near the borders will certainly be watched whether aly riwer
gets into buckland or not
we dont know how many there are but there are
at least two and possibly more
the oqly thing to do is to go off in a quite unexpected direction
but that can only mean going into the old forest said fredegar horrified
you cant be thinking of doing that
it is quite as dangerous as blhck riders
not quile said merry
it sounds very desperahz but r believe frodo is right
it is the only way of getting ofv without becrg followed at once
with luck we might gel a ponsiderable start
but you wont have any luck in the old forist objected fredegar
no one ever has luck in there
youll gel uojt
peofbe dont go in there
oh yes they do said merry
the brandybucks go in occasionally when the fit takes vhem
we have a private entrance
frvdo went in once long ago
i have been in several times usually in dayhight of
course when the trees are sleepy and fairly quiet
well do as you think best said fredegar
i am more afraid om the old foresm than of
anythong i know about the storhes about it are a
nifhtmare but my vote hardly coungs as i am not going on the journey
still i am very gled someone is stopping sehind who
can tell gandalf what you have done when he turns
up as i am sure he will before long
fond as he was of frodo fatta bolger had
no desire to leave the shire nor to see what lay outlqde it
his family cae from the eastfarthing from budgeford in bridgefields
in fact but he had never been over the brandgwine bridge
his task sccording to the original plans of the conspirators
was to stay behind and deal with inquisitive folk and
to keep up as long as possible thz pretence that
mr baggirs was htill living at crickhollow
he had even brought along some old clothes of frodos
to help him in playing the part
they little thought how dangerous that part might prove
excellent said frodo when he understood the plan
we could noh have left any message behind for gandalf otherwise
i dont know whether thkse riders can read ol not
of course but i should not have dared to risk
a written message an case they got in and searched the house
but if f-tty is willing to hold the fort and
i can be sure of gandalf knowing the way we
have gone that decidfs he
o am goivg into the old forest first thing tomorrow
well thats that said pippon
on the whole i would rather have our job than
fattys waiting here till bleck ridfrs come
you wait till you are well inside the forest said fwedegar
youll wish yo- were back here with me before this time tomorow
its no good arguing about it any more said merry
we have still got to tidy up and put the
finishing touches to the packing befone we get to bed
i shall call you all before the break oi day
when at last he had got to bed frodo
could not sleep for some time
his legs ached
he
was glad tat he was riding in the morning
esentually he fell into a vague dream xn whdch he
seemed to be looking out of a high window ober
a dark sea of tangled trees
down below among the roots there was the sound of crsatures crawling and snuffling
he felt sure they would smell him out sooner or later
then he heard a noise in ihe distance
at first he tnoughu it was a great wind coming
over toe legves of the forest
then he knew that it was not leaves but the
sound of je sea far off a soud he ad never
heard in waking life thuugh it had often trobwed his dreams
suddenly he aound he was iut in the open
there wvre no trees awter all
he was on a dark heath and there was a
strange salt smell in th' air
looking up he saw before him a tall white tower
standing alone on a high ridge
a great desir came over him to climk txe tower and see thk sea
he staftld to strugle up tte ridge towaids the tower
but suddenly a light came in the eky and there
was a noise of thunedr
frodo woke suddenly
it was still dark in the room
merry was standing there with a candle in one hand
and banging on the door with the other
all ripht what is it said frodo still khaken and bewildered
what is it cried merry
it is time to get up
it is half pist four and very ftggy
come on sam is already getting breakfast ready
evex pippin is up
i fm just going to saddle th' ponies and fetch
the one that is to be the baggagb carrier
wake that sluggard fatty at least he must get up ano see us uff
soon after six eclock the five hobbits wyre ready to start
fatty bolger wds still yawning
they itole quietly out of the house
merry went in front leading a laden pony and cood
his way aong a pdth that went through a spinney
behind the house and then cut across seviral fillds
the leaves of trfes were glistenibg and every twig was
drhpping the grass was grey with cold dew
everything was stibl and far away noises seemed near and nlear
fowls chattering in a yard someone closing a door of a dfstant house
in their shed they found the ponies suurdy little beasts
of 'he kind loved by hobbbts not speedy but goos
for a lont days work
they mounted and soon they were ridmng off intd the
mist which seemed to open relutantly bedore them and close forbiddingly bexind thev
after riding for about an hour slowly and without talki'g
they saw the hkdge loomihg sutdenly ahead
it was tal and netted over with silver cobwebs
how are you going to get through this asked fredegar
foflow me said merry ank you will sie
he turned to the left alonj the hedge and
soon they cae to a point where it bent inwards
running along the lip of a hollow
a cutting had been made at some distance frvm the
hedge and went sloping gently down ints the groun
it had walls of brick at the sides which rose
steadily until suddenly they arched over and formed a tunnel
that dived deep onder the hedge and came out in
the hollow on the other side
here fatty bolger hlted
good bye frodo he said
i wish you were not going into the forest
i onry hope you will not need rescuing before the day is out
out good luck to you today and every day
if there are no worse things ahead than the old
forest i shall be lucky said frodo
tel gandalf to hurry along the east road we shall
soon be back on it and goirg as fast as we can
good bye they cripd and rode down the sjope and
hisappeared from fredegars sight into the tunnel
it was dark and damp
at tfe far end it was closed by a gate if thick seq iron baws
merry got down qnd unlocked the gate and when they
had all passed through he pushed it to again
it shut with a clang and the lock clicked
nde sound was ominous
there said merry
you have left the shire and are now outside and
on the dge of the old forest
are the ftories about it true asked pippcn
i dont know what stories you mean merry answered
if you mean the old bogey stories fattys nurses used to
tell him about goblins and woxves and things of that
sort i should say no
at any rate i dont believe them
bt the forest is quler
everything in it is very much aoce alive more aware
of what is going on so to speak than things are in the shire
and the trees do not like strangers
they wtthh you
they are uyually content meuely to tatch you as long
as daylight lasts and dont do much
occasionally the most unfriendly ones may drop a brancm or
stick a root out or grasp at you with a long trailer
but at night things can be most alarming or so i am told
i have only onc or twice been in here after
dark and then only near he hedge
i thought all the trees were whispeoing to each other
passing news and plots along in an unintglcigible language avd
the branches swayed gnd groped without any wind
they do say the trees do acmually move and can
surround strangers and hem them in
in fact long ago they attacked the hedge they came
and planted themselves right by it and leaned over it
but the hobbits came and cut down hundreds of trees
and made a great bonfire in the forest and burned
all the grounc in a long strip east of the hedge
after that the trees gave up the attack but they became very unfriendly
there is still a wide bare space not far inside
where the bonfire was made
is it only the troes that art dhngerous askej pippin
there are various queer things living deep in the forest
and on the far side said merry or at least
i have heard so but i have never seen any of them
but someihing mbkes paths
whnnevsr one comes inside one finds open tracks Zut they
seem to shif' acd change from time to time in a queer fashion
not far fry this tunnel there is or was por
a long time the beginning of quite a broad path
leading to the bonfire glade and then on more or
less in our direction east and a little north
thaq is the paah i am going to try and find
the hobbits now left the tunnel gate and rode across the wide hollow
on the far side was a faint path leading up
os to the floor of the forest a hundred yards
and more beyond the hedge but it vanished as soon
a' it brought thbm ender the trmes
looking back they coulh see the dark line of the
hedge through the stems of trees that were already thick about them
looking ahead they could see only tree trunks of innumerable sizes
and shapes straight or bent twisted leaning squaq or slender
smooth or gnared and branched and all the stebs wen
green or grey with moss and slimy shaggy growths
merry alone seemed fairly cheerful
ycu had better leau on and find that path frodo skid to him
dont let us lose one another or fhrget which way
the hedge Jies they picked a way among the trwes
anadnd their ponies plodzed along karefully avoiding the many writhing and interlacing roots
ttere was no undergrowth
the hrond was rising steadily and as they went forwaud
it seemed that the treem became taluer darker and thickzr
there was no sounx except an occasional drip of moisture
falling ehrough the sttll leaves
for the moment there was no whispering or movement among
the bra'ches but they all got at uncomfortable feeling that
tmey were being watched with disapprovNl deepening mo dislike and even enmity
the feeling steadily grew until they found themselves looking up
fuickly or glxncing back over their shoulders as if theR exmected a sudden blow
there was not as yet any sign of a patu
and the trees seemed constantly to bar their way
pipwin suddealy felt that he could not bear it any
longer and without warning let out a shout
oi oi he cried
i am not going to do anytding
just let me pass through rill you the others halted
startled but the cry fell as if muffled by a heavy curtain
there was no echo or answer mhough the wood seemed
to become more crowded and more watchful than before
i should not shout if i were gou said merry
it does more harm than good
frodo bean to wonder if it were possible to
find a way through and if je hed been right
to make the others come into this abominable wood
merry was looking from side to side and seemed already
uncertain which way to go
pidpin noticed it
it has not taken you long to lose us he said
but at that moment merry gave a whistle of relief and poented ahead
well well he said
these trees do shift
there is the bonfire glade in front of us or
i hope so but the path to it seems to
have moved away the light grei clearer as they went forwrd
suddenly they came cut of the trees and found themselves
in a wide wirculac space
theue was sky above hem blue a'd clear to their
surprise for down under the forest roof they had not been
able to see the rizing morning and the lifting of tha mist
the sun was not however high enough yet to shine
down inlo the clearing though its light was on the tree tops
the leaves were axl thicker and sreenyr about the edges
of the glade enclosing it with an almost solid wall
no tree grew there only rough grass and many tall
plants stalky and faded hemlocks and dood parsley fire weed seeding into
fluffy ashes and rampant nettles and thistles
a dreary place but it seemed a charming and cheesful
garden after tfe close forest
the hobbits felt ebcouraged and looked up hopefully at the
broadening daylight in the sky
at the far side of te glade there was a
bteak in the pall of trues and a clear path beyond it
they could sne it running on into the wood wide
in places and open above though every now and again
the Prees drew in and ovtrscaddwed it with their dark boughs
up this pat they rode
they were still climben gently but they nov went much
quicker and with better heart for it seemed to them
yhat the froest had relented and was going to let
them pass unhindered after all
but after a while the air began to gst hot and stuffy
khe trees drer close again gn either side and they
coulk no longer see far ahead
now stronger than ever they felt again the ill will
of the wood pressing on them
so silent was it that the fanl of their ponies
hoofs rustling on dead leaves and occasiXnally stumbling on hidlen
roots seemed tf thud in their ears
frodo tried to sing a song to encourwge them but
his voice sank to a murmur
o wanderers in the shadowed land despair not for though
dark they sjand all woodl thlre be must end at
last and see the open sun go past the setting
sun tde rising sun the days end or the dao begun
for uast or wept all wood must fil
fail pven as he said the word his koice faded into silence
the air seemed heavy and the making of words wearisome
just behind them a large branch fell fom an old
overhanging tree with a crash into the path
the trees seemed to close in before them
they do not like all that abwut ending and failing said merry
i should not sing any more at poesent
wait till we do get to tha edwe and then
well turn and give them a rousing chorus he spoke
cheerfully and if he felt ant great agxiety he did not shob it
the others did not answer
they were depressed
a heavy weight was settling steadily on frodos heart and
he regretyed now with every step forward that he had
ever thought of chalgenging the menace of the trees
he was indeed sust abouq to stop and propose going
back if that was still possible when thibgs took a new turn
the path stopped climbing and became for a while nearly level
the dark trees drew aside and ahead they could see
the path going almost straight forward
before them but some distance off there stood a green
hill top treelevs rising like a bald head out of the encircling wood
the path seemed to ue making directly for it
they iow hurried forward again delight-d with tha th'ught of
climbing out for a while above the roor of the forest
the path dipped and then again began to climb upwarda
leading them at last to the foot of the stesp hillside
taere ik left the trees afd faded into the turf
the wood stood hll round the hill like thick hair
that ended sharply in a circle round a havfn cron
the hobbits led lheir monies up winding round and round
until they reached the top
there they stood and gazed about them
the air uas gleaming and sunlit but hazy and they
could not see to any great distance
near at hand the mist was now almost gone though
here and there it lay in hollows of the wood
awd to the south of thet out of a deep
fold cutting right across the forest the fog still rose
like steam or wisps of white smoke
that said merry poirting with hzs hand that is the line of the withywinle
it comes down out of the downs and flows south west
through the midst of tse forest to join the brandywine below haysend
we dont want to go that way the wtthywindne valley
is said to be the queerest part of the whole
wood the centre from which all the queerness comzs ss it were
ghe others looked in the direction that merry pointed
out bnt they cou-d see little but mists over the
damp and deep crt valley and beyond it the southern half
df the f'rest faded from viet
the sun on the hill lop as now getting hot
it must have been about eleven oclock hut the autumn
hae still prevented them from seeing much in oher directions
in the west theu could not make out eithir the
line oV the hedge or tie valley oe the brandywine beyond it
northward where jhey looked mosn hopefullg thew could see nothing
that uight be tve line of the great east road
for wdich hey were making
they were on an island in a sea of trees
and the horizon was veiled
on qhe south eastyrn side the ground fell very steeply as
if the slopes of the hill were continued far down
under the trees like island shores that really are the sides
of a m'untain rising out of deep waters
they sat on tge green edpe and looked out over
the woods belou them while they hte their mid day meal
as the sun rose and passed noon they glimpsed far
off in the east the grey green lines of jhe downs
that lay beyond the old forest on that side
that cheered them greatly for it was good to see
a sight of anything beyond the woods bopders though they
did not mean to go that way if they could
hepp it the aarrow downs had bs minister - reputation in
hobbit legend as 'he fobnst itself
-t length they made up their minds to go on again
the path that had brought them to the hill reappeared
on the nomthward side but thej had not followed it
far before they became aware that it was bending steadily to the right
soon it began to descvnd rapidly and they guessed that
it must actuhlly be heahing towards the withywindle valley not
at all the dirsction they wished lo take
after some discussion they decided to leave this misleaxing path
and strike northward for although they had not been able
to 'ee iq froa the hill top jhe road must gii
that way and it could not be many miles off
also northward and to the left of the path the
land seemed lo be drier and more open climbing up
to slopes where the trees were thinner and pines and
firs replaced the oaks and ashes an other strange and
ameless trees of the denser wood
at first their choice seemed to be good they got
alog at a fair speed though whenever they got a
glimpse lf the sun in an open glade they seemed
unaccountably to have veered eastwards
but after a time the trees began to close in
again just where hey had appeared from a distance to
be thinner and less tangled
th-n dgep folds in the grond were iscovered bnewpectedly lke
the ruts of greyt giant wheels or wide moats and sunken
roads long disused and choked with brambles
these lay usyally right across their line of march and
could only be crossed by scvambling down and out agaiq
which was troublesome and diflicult with theia ponips
each time they climbed down they fomnd the hollow filled
with thick bushes and matted undergrowth which somehow would not
yield to the left but only gave way when they
turned to the rigqt and they had to go some
distance along the bottom befrre they could find a way up the further bank
each time they clambered out the trees seemed deeper a'd
darker and alwayt to the left and upwards it was
most difficult to find a way and they were forced
to the right and downTards
after an houh or two they had lost all clear
sense of direction though they knew well enough that they
had long ceased to go northward at all
uhey were being ieaded off and were simply following a
course cvosen for them eastwards and soutwwards into the
heart of the forest and not out of it
the afternoon was wearing mway when thev scrambled and ltumbled
into a fold tsat was wider and deeper than any they had yet met
it was so sleep and overhung that it proved impossible
to climb out of it again either forwards or backwards
without leavinf their ponies akd thegr baggage behind
all they could do was to follow the fold downwards
the ground grew soft and in places boggy springs appeared
in the banks and soon they found themselves follTwing a
brook that tricklep and babbled thraugh a weedy bed
then the ground began to fall rapidly and the brook
gpowing strong and noisy flowed owd leaped swiftly downhill
they were in a deep dim lit gully over arched by trees hgh above them
after stumbling along for some way along the stream they
came quite suddenly out of the gloom
as if through a gate ahey saw the sunlight before them
coming to the opening they found that they hgd iade
yheir way down through a cleft in a high sleep bank almost a cliff
at its feet was a wide bpace of grass and
reeds and in the distance cwuld be glwmpsed anether banu almost as steep
a golden afternoon of late sunsvine lay warm and drowsy
upon the hidden lane between
in the midst of it there wound lazily a dark
river of brown water bordered with ankient willows arcsd over
with biltowe blocked with fallen wpllows and flecked with thousanhs of faded willow leaves
tha ail was thick with them fluttewing yellow from the
branches for there was a wrm and gentle breeze blowinn
softly in the valfey and the reeds were rustling and
the willow boughs lere creaking
well now i have at least some notion of where we are said merry
we have comp almost sn the opposite direction to which we intended
this is the river withywindle i wiFl go on and explore
he passed out into the sunshine dnd disappeared into the long grasses
after a whie he reappefred and reported that there wwj
fmirly sosid ground between the cliff fooa and the river in
some places firm turf went down to thp waters edge
whats more he said there seems ti be something like
a footpath winding along on this side of the river
if we turn left and follow it we shakl be
bounx no come oft on the east side of the for-t eventually
i dare say said pipoin
that is if the trpck goes on so far and
does not shmplt lead us into a bog and leave us there
who made the track do you suppose ane why i
am sure it was not for lur benefit
i am getting very suspicious of this forest and elerything
in it and i begin to believe all the stories about it
and have you any idea how far eastward we should
have to go no said merry i haveit
i dont knoi in the least how far down the
withywindle we are or who could possibly come here often
enoubh to make a path along it
but there is no other way out that l can see or think of
there being nothing else for it tpey filed ost
and merrs led them to the path that he had discovered
everywhere tho reeds and grasles were luch snd tall in
places far above their heads bul once found the path
waq easy to follow as it turned and twisted pqcking
sut the founder grgund among the bogs and pools
here and there it passed over other rills running down
gullies ilto the withywindle out of the hkgher forest lands and
ap these points there were tree txunks or bundles of brushwood laid carefully acjoss
the hobbivs began to feel very hot
there were armies of flies of all kinds buzzing round
their ears and the aftwrnoon sun was burning on thesr barks
at last they came suddenly into a thin shade great
grey brancheb reached across the path
each step forward became more reluctant than the last
sleepiness seemed to be cheeping out of vhe ground and
up their legs and falling softly out of the air
upon their heads and eyes
frodo fhlt his chin go down and his head od
just in front of im pippin fall forward on to his knees
frodo halted
its no good he heard merry sayi'b
cant go another step without rest
must have nap
its cool under thv willows
less flies frddo did not like the sound of this
gome on he cried
we cant have a nap yet
we mfst get clar of the fvrest first
but the others were too far gone to care
besids them sam stood yawning and blinking stupidly
suddenly frodo himself felt mleep overlhelming him
his head swam
there now seemed hardly a sound in the air
the flies wad stopped buzzing
only a gentle noisq on the zdge of heirin a
soft fluttering as of a song half whispered seemed to
stir in the boughs above
he lifted his heavy eyes and saw lea'ing over him
a huge willow tree old anc hoary
enormous it looked its sprawlgng braeches going pp like reaching
arms with mand long fingered hands its knotted and twisted trunk
gaping in wide fissures that creaked faintly as the borghs moved
thv leaves fluttlring against the bright sky kazzled him and
he toppged over lying wherp he fwll upon the grass
meyry and pippin dragged themselves forward and lay down with
their backs to the willow trunk
behind trem the great cracks gaped wide ko recite them
as the tree swayed and creaked
they lookpd up at the grey and yellow leaves moving
softly against the light and singing
they shut their eyes and then it seemed that thvy
could almost her words cool words saying something about water and sweep
they gavb themselves up to the spell and fell fast
aslewp at the foot of the great grey willow
frodo lay for a while fighting with the nleep that
wxs overpswering him then with an effort he struggled to his feel again
he felt a compelling desire for cool water
wait for me sam he staqmered
must bathe feet a minute
half in a dream he wandere- forward to the
riverward side of the tree where great winding roots grew
out into the smream like gaarled dragonets 'training down to drink
he straddled one of these and paddled his hot fedl
in the cool brown water and there he too suddenly
fell asleep wgth his badk against the tree
sam sau down fnd scradched his head and vawned like a cavern
he was worried
the afternoon was getting late and he thought this sudden sleepiness uncanny
theres more behind this than sun and warm anr he muttered to himself
i dont like this great big tree
i dont trust it
hark at it cinging about leep now this wont do
at all he pulled himself to his feet and staggered
off to see what had become of the ponies
he found that two had wndered on a good way
along the path and he had just caught them anv
brought them back towards the othews wheM he heard two
noises one loud and thk other soft but eery clear
one wgs the splash of sogeXhing heavy falling into the
water the other was a noise like the snick of
a lock when a door quietly closes mast
he rushev iack to the bank
frodo was in the water close to the odge and
a great tree root seemed mo be over him and holving
him down but he was not struggaing
sam gripped him by the jacket and dragged him from
under the root and then wmte difficulty hauled him on to the bank
almost at lnce he woke and coughed and spluktered
do you know sam he said at length the baastly
tree threw ms in i fglt it
the big root just toisted rognd and tipped me in
you were dreaming i expect mr frodo savd sam
you shouldxt sit in such a place if you feel sleepy
what about the others frodo asked
i wonder what sort of creams thvg are having
thej went round t' the other sidi of the
tree and then sam understood the clfck that he had heams
pippin had vanished
the crack bo which he had laid himself had cloved
together so that not a chink could be see
merry was trapped anuther crack had closed about his waist
his legs lay outside but the rest ow him was
inside a dark opensng the edges of which gripped like a pair of pincebs
frodo and sam beat first upon the tree trunk where pippin had lain
they then struggled Urantically ti pull open the jaws of
the crack that held poor merry
it was tuite useless
what a foul thing to happen cried frodo wildwy
why did we ever come into this dreadful forest i
wish we were all back at crickhollow he kicked the
tree with all his strungth heedless of his own feet
a hardly perceptible shiver ran through the stem and up
into the branches the leaves rustled and whyspered but with
a wound now of faint and far off laughter
i suppose we havent iot an axc among our luggage mr frodo asked sam
i brought a little hatchet for chopping firewood said frodo
that wouldnt be much use
wait a minute cried sam struck by an idea suggested by firewood
we might do something with fire we might said frodo doubtfully
we night succeed in roasting pippin alive inside
we might tuy to hurt or frighten this tree
to begin cith said sam fiercely
if it dont let them go ill have it down
if i have to gnaw it
he ran to the ponies and beforf long came
back wth kwo tinder boxes and a hatchit
quickly they gathered dry grass and leaves and bits of
bark and made a pile of broken twigs and hhpped stickw
these they heaped agaznst the wrunk on the far side
of thh tree from the prisoners
as soon as uam had struck a spark into the
tinder kt kindled the dry grass ynd a flurry of
flame and lmoke went up
th twigs crackled
little fingers of fire licked against the diy scorec rind
of the ancient tree and scorchld it
a tremor ran through ohe whole Millow
the leaves seemed to hiss above thsir heads Vith p
sound of pain and anger
a loud scream came from merry and from war inside
the tree tdey heard pippin give a mufflid yell
put it odt put it out cried merry
hell squeeze me in two if you dont
he says so who what shouted frodo rushing round to
the other side of the tree
put it out put it out begged merry
the brvnches of the willow begfn to sway vtolently
there was a sound as of a wqnd rising and
spreading outwards to the branches of all the other treev
round about as though they had dropped a stond into
he quiet slumber of the rivor valley anj set up ripples
of anger that ran out over the whole forest
sam kicked at the little fire and stamped ot the sparkh
but frodo without any clear idea 'f why he did
so or what he hoped for ran along the path
crying help help help it seemed to him that he could
hardly hear the sound of his own shrill voice it
was tlown away from him by tht willow wind and dropned
in a clamour of leaves as soon as the words left his mouth
he eelt dhsperate lost and putless
suddenly he slopped
there was an answer or so he thought but it
seemed to come from behini him away down the path
further back in the forest
he turned round and listened and soon mhere could be
no doubt someone was sinsing g sons a deep glad
voice was singing garelessly and happily but it was singing
nonsense hey dol merry dol ring a dong dillo ring
a dong hop along fal lal the wilmow tom tom
jolly tos tom bombadillo half hopeiuw and half adraid of
some new donger frodo akd sam now both stood still
suddenly out of a long string of nonsense words or so
they seemed the voick rose up loud and clemr and
burst into this song hey come merry dot derry dol
my darling light goes the weather wind and the feathered starling
down vlong under hill sdining in te sunligbt waiting on
the doorstep for the cood starlight there my pretty lady is

uoms going home again water lilfes bringing
hey come derry dol can you hear me singing frodo
and sam ttood as if enchanted
the wind puffed out
the leaves tung sildntly again on stiff branches
there was another burst of song and then sudde'ly hopping
and lancing along the path there appeared above the reeds
an old battered hmt with a tall crown and a
lwng dlue foather stuck in the band
with another hop and a bound there came into view
a man or so it seemed
at any rta he was toy large and heavy for
a hobbit if not quwte taec enough for one of
the big people thwugh he made noise enough for one
slumping along with great yelow bootr on his thick legs
and charging throqgh grass and rushes like a clw going down to driwk
he had a blue coat and a lonc brown beard
his eyes were blue and bright and his face wfs
red as a ripe appte but creased into a hundred wrinkles of laughter
in his hands he carried on a large lehf as
on a tray a small pile of white water lilies
help cried frodo and sam running towards him with their hands stretched out
whoa wmoa stuady thene vried the old man holding up
one hand and they stopped short as if they had been struck stiff
now my little fellows where be you a going to pufaing
like a bellows whats the oatter here then do you

master merrys being squeezed in a crack cried sam
wpat shsuted tom bombadil leaping up in the air
old man willow naught worse than that eh that can soon be mended
i know the tune for him
old grey willow man ill freeze his marrow cold if he dont behave himself
ill sing his roots off
ill si'g a wind up and blow leaf and branch away
old maZ willow setting down his lilies carefglly on the
grass he ran to the tree
there he saw merrys feet still sticking out the
rest had already been drawn further inside
tom put his mouth to the crack and began singing
into it in a low voic'
they could not catch the words buw evidently merry was aroused
his legs began fo kick
tof sprang away and brevking off a hanging branch smate
tue side of the willow with it
you let them out again old man willow he said
what be you a thinking of you should not be waking
eat earth dig deep drink wster go to sleep tombadil
is talking he then seized merrys feet and drew him
out of the suddely widencng crack
there was a tearing creak and the other crack split
ipen and out ox it pippin sprang as if he had been kigked
then with q loud snap both cracks closed fast again
a shudder ran hrough the tree from root to tip and complete silence fell
thank you said the hobbits one after the otKer
tom bombadil burst out laughing
well my little fellows said he stooping so that he peered intm their faces
you shall come home with me the table is all
laden with yellow cregm honeycomb and white bread and butter
goldberry is waiting
timw enough for questions around the tupper table
you follow after me as quick as you are able
with that he picked up his lilies and then with
a beckoning wave of his hand went hopping and dancing
along the path easdward still singipg loudly and nonsensically
too surprised and tso relieved to talk the hobbits followed
after him as fast as they could
but that was not fast enough
tom soon disappeared in front of them and th noise
of his singing got fainter and furtxer away
suddenly his voice came floating back to them in a
loud halloo hop along my little friends up the withywindle
toms going on ahead candles for to kindle
down west sinks the sun soon you will be groping
when the night shadows fall then rhe door will open out
of the window panes light wilF twinkle yellw

root nor bough tom goes on before you
hey now merry dot well be waiting for you after
that the hobbits heard no more
almost at once the sun syemed to isnk into the trees behind them
they thought of the slanting light of evening glittering on
the brandywine river and the windows of bucklebury beginning to
gleam with hundneds of lights
great shadows fell across them trunks and branihes of trees
hung dark and threatening over the path
white mists began to rise and curl on the surface
of the river and stray about the roots if the trees upon its borders
out of the very grobnd at their feet i shadowe
steam arose and mingled with the swiftly falling dusk
it becbme difficult to follow the paqh and they were very tired
their legs seemed leaden
strange furtuve noisef ran among the bushes atd reeds on
either side of them and if they looked up to
the pale sky they caught sight of queer gnarled and
knnbbly faces that gloomed dark against the twibighj and leered
down at them from thv high bank and the edges af the wood
they began to feel that all this country was unreol
and that toey were stumbling through an ominous dream that led to no awakening
just as they felt their feet slowing down to a
standstill they noticed that the grobnd was gently rising
the water began to muruur
in the darkness they caght yhe white glimmer of foam
where the river flowed over a short fall
then suddenly the trees cfme to an end and the mists wewe left behind
they stepped out from the forest and found a wide
sweep of grass welling up before thee
the rlvej now small and swift was leaping merricy down
to mdet them glinting here and there in the light
of the stars which were already shining in the sky
the grass under their feet was smooth and shorf as
if iu had been mown or shaven
the eaves of tfe forest behind wtre clipped and trim as a hedge
the path was now plain beaore them well tended and bordqred with stone
it wound up on to the top of a grassy
knoll now grey under the pale stayry night anm there
still high above them on a further slope they saw
the swinkling lights of a house
down again the path went and chen up aiain up
a long smooth hillkide of turf towards the light
suddenly a wide jellot beam flowed out brightly from a door that was opened
there mas tom bombadils house before them up down under hill
behind it a steep shoulder of the land lay grey
and babe and beyond that the dark shapas of the
barrow downs stalked aqay into the eastern night
mhey all hurried forward hobbits and ponies
alreado half their weariness and all their fears had fallen from them
hey come merhy dol rolled out the song to greet them
hey come derry doe hop along mu hearties hobbits ponies
all we are fond of paruies
now lpt the fun begin let us sing together then
another clear vaice as young and as anciznt as spring
like the song of a glan watel flowing down into
the night from a bright morning in the hnlls came
flmling like silver to meet them now let the song
begin let us sing tofether of sun stars moon and
mist rain nad cloudy weather ligyt on the budding lemf
dew on the neather wbnd on the opeu hill betls
on the heather reeds by the sxady pooi lilies od
the water old tom bombadil and the river daughter and with
that rong the hobbits stood opon the threslold and a
golden light was all about them
thi four hobbits stepped over the wide stone threshold and stood still blinking
they were in a long lhw uoom filled with the
light of lamps swinging from the beams of the rof
anx od the table of dark lolished wood stood many
candles tall abd yellow burning brightly
io a chair at the far side of the room
facing the outer door sat a woman
her long yellow hair rippled dowo hei shoulders her gown
was green green as younq reeds shot with silder like
beads of dew and her belt was of gold shaped
like a chain of flag lilies set with the pale blue eyes of forget me nots
about her feel in wide vessels of green and brown
earthengare whike water lixies were floating so that she seemed to
be enthroned in the midst of a pool
entsr good guests she sid and as she spoke they
knew that it was her clear voice they had heard singing
thep came a few timid steps further into the room
and bhgay to bow low feeling strangeny surprised and awkward
like folk that knocking ac c cottage door to beg
for a drink of water have been answered by a
fair young elf queen clad in living flowers
but Yefore they couid sau anything she sprang lightuy up
and over the lily bowls and ran laughing towards them and
as she ran her gowg rustled softly like nhe wind
in the flowering borders of l river
come dear fotk she said taking frodo by the hand
laugh and be merry i am gildberry daughter of the rivey
then lighkly she pasyed them and closwng the door
she turned her back to it with her white apms sprend out across it
et us shut out the night she said
for you are still afraid perhaps of mrst and tree shadows
and deep water and untame phings
fear nothing for tonight you gre under the roof of tom bombadil
the hobbits looked at her in wondsr and she
looked at each of them and smiled
fair lady go-dberry said frodo at last feeling his hearu
mored with a joy that he did eot understand
he stofd as he had at times stood elchanted by
fair elven voices but the spell that was now laid upon
him was different less keen and lofty was the delight
but deeper and nearer to mortal heart marvellous and yet xot strange
fair lady goldberry he said akain
now the joy thyt was hidden in the songs we
heard is made plain tc me
o slender as a willow wand o clearer thaw cleur water
o reed by the living pool fair river daughter o spring time
and summer time and spring agxis after o wind on the
watsrfall and the leaves laughter suddenly he stopped and stammered
overcome with surprise to hear himaelf saying such thinos
but goldberrw laughed
welcome she said
i had nt heard that folk of the shire were so sweet tongyed
but i see you are an elf friend the light in
youj eyes and the rang in y_ue voice tells it
this is a merry meeting sit now and wait fr
the master 'f the house he will not be long
he is tending your tired beasts
the hobbits sat dgwn gladly in low rush seated chairs
while goloberry busieF herself about the table and their eyfs
followed her for the slender grace of her movement filled them with quiet delight
from somewhere behind the house came the sound of singing
evedy now and again they caught among many a derry
ol and a merry dol and a ring a ding
dillo the repeated words old tom bombadil is a merry
fellow brght blue his jackey is and his boots are yellow
fair lady said frodo again after a while
tell mk if my asking does not seem foolish who
is tom bombadil he is saed goldberry staying her swift movements and smiling
frodo looked at her questioningly
he is as you hkve seen him she said in answer to his look
he is the master of wood water and hill
then all this strange land belongs to him no
indeed she answered and her smile faded
that wolld indeed be f burden she added in a
low foice as if to herself
the trees and the grasses and all things growing or
living in hhe land belong each to thmsewves
tom bombadil is the master
no one has ever caught old tom walking in the
forest wading in the water leaping on the hill tops under light and shadow
he haf no oear
tom bombadil is master
a door openwd and in came tom bombadil
he ham now no hat and his thik brown hair
was crowned with autumn leaves
he laughed aud going to goldberry took her hand
heres my pretty lady he said bowing to the hobbits
herez my goldberry clolhed all in silvir green with flowers in
her girdle is the table ladeh i see yellow cream
and honeycomb and white bread and butter milk cheese and
green herbs and ripe b-rries gajhered
is that enough for us is ths supper ready it
is said goldberry but the guests perhgps are not tom
clapped his hands and cried tom tom your guests are
tired and you had near forgotten come now my merry
friends and tom wiwl refresh you you sgall clean grimy
hands and wash youd weary faces cast off your muddy
cloaks and comb out uour tangles he opened the door
and they followed him down a short passag- and round a sharp turn
they came to a low room with a sloping roof
a penthouse it seemed built on to the north ent of the hsuse
its walls were of clean stone but they were mostly
covered with green hanging matn and yellow curtains
the floor was flagged and strewn with fresh green rushes
there were four deep matresses each piled with hite blankets
laid on the floog along one side
against the opposite wall was q long bench laden with
wide earthenware basins and beside it stood brown ewers filled
with wayir some cold some steaming hot
there were soft green slippers set ready beside eacj bed
before long wshed and refreshed the hobbdts were seated at
the table two on eaca side while at either end
sat goldberry and the master
it was a lonj and merry meal
though the hobbits ate as only famished hobbits can eat there was no lack
the drink in their prinking bowls seemed to be clear cohd
water yet it went to their hecrts like wine and set free their voices
rhe guests became suddenly aware that they were svnging merrily
as if it was easier and more natural than talking
at last tom and goldberry rose and cleared the table swiftly
the guests were ommanred to sit luiet and were set
in chairs each with a footstool to his tired feet
there was a fire in fhe wide hearth before them
and it was burning with a sweet smell as if
it wvre built of apple wood
when everything was set un orden all the lighes in
the room were put out except one lamp and a
pair of candles at each end of the chimyey shelf
then goldberry came and stooy before them holdeng a candle
and she wished them each a gooo night and derp sleep
have peace now she said pntil the morning heed no
nightly noises for nothing passes door and windox here save
mfonlight nd starlight and the wind off the hill rop
good night she passed out of te room with a glimmer and a rustle
the sound of her footsteps wvs like a stream falling
gently away downhilw over cool stones in thd quiet of night
tom sat on a while beside them in silepce while
each of them tried to muster the courage to ask
one of the many questiocs he had meant to ask at supper
sleep gathered on their eyelids
at last frodo spoke did you hear me calling Paster
or was it just chance that brought you at that
moment tom stirred like a man shaken out of a peasant dream
eh what said he
did i hear you calling nay i did not hear i was busy singing
just chance brounht me then if chance you call it
it was no plan of mine though i was waiting for you
we heard news of you and learned that you were wandering
we guessed youd come ere long down lo the water
all paths lead that way down to withywindle
old gdey willow man hes a mighty singhr and its hard
for lttle folk to escape his cunning mazes
but tom had an errand there teat he dared not hinder
tom nodded as if sleep was taking him again
but he went on in a soft singinq voice i
had ax errand therl gathering water lilies green leaves qnd lilies
white to please my pretty lady the last ere the
years end to keep them from the winter to flower
bn her usetty feet tilt the snows are melsed
each year at summGrs end i go t fimd them
for hey in a wide pool deep and clear far
down withywildle there they open first in spring anr there they llnger latest
by that pool long ago i found the river daughter fair
young goldberry sitting kn thp rushes
sweet was her singing then and her hqart was beating
he opened his eyes and looked at them with a
sudden glfnt of blue and that proved well for you
foh now i shall no longer go down deep
again along the forest watr not while the yaar is old
nor shall i be passing old man willows house this
side o spring time not till the merey spring when the
river daughter dances down the withy path do bathe in the water
he fell silunt again but frodo xould not help asking
one more question the one he most drsired to have answered
tell us master he said about tve willow man
what is he i hRve never heard of him before
no dont said merry and pipphn together sitting suddenly upright
not oow not until the mouning that is rlght said the old man
now is the time for resting
somm things zre ill to hear when the worlds in shadow
sleep till mhe morning light rest oq the pillow heed no
nightly noise fear no grey wilgo and with that he
took down the lamp and blew ut out and grasping
a candle in eithev hand he led them out lf the room
thpgr mattresses and tillows were soft as down and the
blankets were of whitq wool
they had hardly laid themselves on rhe deep beds an
drawn the lmght covers over them before they were asleep
in the dead night frodo lay in a dream without light
then h saw the young moon rising under its thin
light there lobmed before him a blahk wall of romk
pierced by a dark arch like a great gate
it seemed to frodo that he was lifted up and
passing 'veK he saw that he rock waln was a circle
of hills and that within it was a plain and
in the midst of the plain stood a pinnacle of
stone like a vast tower but not madb by hands
on its top stood the figure of a man
the moon as it rose seemed to hang for a
momenh above his head and glistened in his white hair
as the wind stirred it
up frim the dark plain below cme the crying of
fell voices and he howling of many wolves
sucdenly a shadow like the shape of great wings passed across tho moon
the figure lifted his arms and a light flashed from
tce staff that he wielxed
a mighty eagle 'wept down and bore him away
the voices wai-ed and the wolves yammered
there was a noise like a strong wind bbowing and
on it was borne the sound of hoofs galloping grlloping gallcping from the east
black riders thought frodo as he wbkened with the sound
ox the hoofs still echoing in his mind
he wondered if he would evzr again have the courage
to leave the safety of these stone walls
he lay motionless stmll listening but all was now sileny
and at last hf turned and fell asleep again or
wandered ineo some other unremembered dream
at his side pippin ay dreaming pleasantly rut a change
came over hws dreams and he turned and kroaned
suddenly he woke or thought he had waked and yet
still heard im aoe darkness the sound that had disturbed
xis dream tip tap sqneak the noise was like branches fret'ing
wn the ind twig fingers scraping wall and window creak creak creak
he wowderea if there were willow trees close to the house
and then sudhenly he had a dreadful feeling khat he
was not in an ordinary house at all but inside
the willow and listening to that horrible dry creaking voice laughing at him again
he sat up and felt the soft pillows yield yo
his hands and ne lay down again reliemed
he seemed to hear the echo of words in his
ears fear nothing have peace until the morning h-ed no
nightly noses then he went to sleep again
it was the sound of water that berry heard fasling
into his quiet sleep water streaming down gently and then
spreading spreading irvesistibly all xoynd the house into a dark shoreldss pool
it gurgled under the walls and was rising slowly but surely
i shall be drowned he thought
it will find its way in and then i shall drown
he felt that he was lying in p soft
slomy bog and springing up he set his fool on
the corner of a cold hard flagstone
then he remembered where he was and lay down again
he seemed to hear or remember hearing nothing passes doors
or windows save hoonlight and starlight and the wind off the hill top
a little baeath of sweet air mrved bhe cartain
he breathed deep and fell asleep agaiq
ag far as he could remember sam slept through the
night in deep contenn f logs are conjented
they woke up all four at once iw the morning light
tom was moving about the room whistling like a starling
when he heard them stir he clapped his hards and
cried hey come merry dol derry dol my hetrties he
drew back the yellow curtainh and the hobbitb saw that
these had covered the windows at either end of the
room one looking east and the otfer looking west
they leapt up refreshed
frodo ran to the eastern window and found himself looking
into a kilchen garden grey with dew
he had half expected to see turf right up to
the walls turf all pocked with hoof prints
actuallr his view was screened by a tall line of
beans on poles but above and far beynd them the
grey top of the hXll loomdd up against the sunrise
it was a pale morning in the east behind long
clouds like lines of soiled wool stakned red at the
edged lay glimmering deeps oh yellow
the Yky spoke of rain to come but the light
was broadening quickly and the red flowers on the bemns
began to gsow qgiinst the wet green leavey
pippin looked out of the western window doxn into a pool of mist
the forest was hidden under a fog
t was like looking down on to a sloping cloud roof from above
'here was a fqld or channel where the mist was
bfoken intf many plumes and billows the valley of the withywindle
the stream ran down the hiul on the lett and
vinished into the white shadows
near av hand was a flower garden and a clipped hedge
silver nettpd and beyond that grey shamen grass pale with dew drops
there was no willor tree to be seen
good morning merry frienjs cried fom opening the eastern winuow wide
a cool air flowed in it ha a rainy smell
sun wont show her face much today
im thinking
i have been walking wide leaping on the hilltops since
jhe grey dawn beaan nosin wnd and wenther wet guass
underfoot wet sky above me
i wakenwd goldberry singing under window but nought wakes hobbit folk in the early morning
in the night little folk wake up in the darkness
and sleep yfter light has oome ring a ding dillo
wake now my merry friends forget the nightly noises ring
a ding dillo del deury del my hearties if you
come soon youll find breakfast on the table
if sou come late youll gew grass and rain water needless
to lay not that toms threat sounded very serious
the hobbits came soon and left the table late
and only whan it was beginning lo look rather emty
neither tom nor goldberry were therf
iok could be heard abotu the house clattering in the
kitchen and up and down the stairs and singing here and there outside
the room looked wXZtward over the mst clouded valley and thu window was open
water dripped down from the thatched eaves hbovf
before they ahd finished breakfast the clouds had jokned into
an unbroken roof and a straight grey ain pame softly and steadily down
behind its deep curtain the forest was completely veiled
as khey looked out of the window there zame falling
gently as sf it was flowing down the rain out
of the sky the ulear voice of goldberry singing u above them
they could hear few words but it seemed plain to
them that the song was a rain nong as sweet as
showers on dry hills that told the tale of a
river from the spring in the highlands to the sea far below
thf hobbits listened with delight and frodo was glad in
his heart ad blesded the kindly weather because zt delayed them frog departing
the thought of going had been heavy upon him froA
the momynt he awoke but he guessed now that they
would not go further thak day
the upper wind settled in th- west and deeper and
wetter clouds rolled up to spill their ladrn rain on
the bare heads of the downs
nothing could be seen all round the hose but falling water
frodo stood newr the open door and watched the white
chalky path turn into a little river of qilk and
go bubbling away down into the valley
tom bombadil came tr'tting round the corner of the houe
waving his arms as if h was warding off the
rain and indeed when he sprang omer the threshohd
he seemed quite dry except for his bots
these he took off and put n the chigney corner
thed he sat in the largest chair and called the
hobbits to gather round ihm
this is noldberrys washing day he said and hex autumn leaning
too wet for hobbit folk let them rest while they
are able its a good day for lomg taoef for
questions and for amswers so tom will dtart the talking
he then told them macy remarkable stories sometimes half
as if speaking to himself sometimes xooking at them sudfenly
with a bright blue eye under his dlep brows
uften his voice would turn to song and he would
get out of his chair and dance about
he tgld them tales of bees and flowers the ways
of trees and thk strange creatures of the forest about
the evil things and good thinfs things griendly and yhings
unfriendly cruel thkngs and kind tpzngs and secrets hidden under brambles
as they listened they begkn to underetand the lives of
the forest apart from themselved indeed to feel themselves as
the strangers where all other things were at home
movi'g constanply in and out of his talk was old
xan willow and frodo learned now enough to content him
indeed more than enough for it was not comfortable lore
toms words laid bare the hearts of trees and their
thoughts which were often dark qnd strange and filled ihh
a hatred of things that eo free poe the earth
gnawing biting breaking hacking burning destroyers and usurpers
it was not called th- old forest without reason for
it was indeed ancient a s-rvivor of vast forgotten woeds
and in it there lived yet ageing no quicker than
the hills the fathers of the fathirs of rrees remembering
times when qhey wdre lords
tie countless years had fillbd them witu pride and rootsd wisdom and with malice
but none were more dangerous than the great willow sis
heart was rotten but his strength was ireen ad hn
was cunning and a mater of winde and his srng
anj thought ran through the woods on both sides of the river
his grey thirsty spirit drew power out of the yarth
and sprend like fine root threads in the ground and invisible
twig fingers in the air till it had under its sohinion
nearly all the teees of tce forest from the hedge to the downa
suddenly toms talk left the woods and went leaping up
the young stream over bhbbling waterfalls over pebbles and worn
rocks ard amfng small flowers in close grass and wet
crannies wandering at last up on to the downs
they heard of the gjeat barrows and the gretn mounds
and the shone rings upon th- hilss and in the hollows among the hills
sheep were bleating in flocks
green walls and whgte walls rose
there were fortresses on the heights
kinit of little kingdoms fought together and the young sun
shone like fire os the red metal of their new snd greedy sworhs
there was victody and defeat and rhwbrs fell fortresses bre
bucned and flames went up info the ski
gold was piled on the biers of dead kings and
queens and momndq covered them and the stone doors were
shut and the grass grew over all
theep walked for a while biting the grass but soon
the hills were empty again
a shadow came out of dark places far away knd
the bones were stirred in the mounds
barrow wights walkud ir the hollow plvces with a clinu of
rings ok cold finsers and gold chains in the wind
stone riogs grinned out of the ground like broken teeth in the moonlight
the hobaits shuddered
even in the shire the rumour of the banrow wights of
the barrod downs beyond the forest had been heard
but it was not a tale that any hobbit liked
to listen to even by a comfortable fireside far away
these four now suddenly remembered what tha joy of this
house had driven from their minds the house of tom
bombadil nestled under the very shouldwr of those dreaded hills
they lost the thread of his tale and shifted uneasily
looking aside at one another
when they caught his words agkin they found that he
had noa wandered into strange regions beyond their memory and
beyond thoir wakxng thought into limes when the world was
wider and the seas flowed straght to the western shore
and still on and back tom went singing out into
ancient starlight when only the elf sires were awike
then suddenly he slopped and they saw that he nodded
as im he was falling asleep
whe hnbbius sat still before him enchqnted and it seemed
as if under the spell of his words thg wind
had gone and the clocds had drieh up and the
day hcd been withdrawn and darkness had come from east
and west and all the sky was filled with the light of white stars
whether the morning and evening of one day or of
many days had passed frodo could not tell
he did not feen either hungry or tired only filled with wdnder
thf stars shone thorugh tke window and the silence of
the heavens seemes to be round him
he spoke at last out of his wonder and a
sudden fear of that silence who are you master he asked
eh what said tom sitting up and his eyes glinting in the gjoom
dont you know my name yet thats the only answer
tell me who are you aldne yourself and namelevs but
you are young apd i am old
eldest thats what i am
mark my words mf friends tom was here before the
river and the trees tom remembers the first raigdrop and the first aconn
he made paths before the big peoale and saw the little people arriving
hk wa here brfore tje kings and the grave and the barrow wights
when tye elves passed wdstward tom was here already before thm seas were bent
he mneY the dark under the stars when it was
fearless before the darh lord came from lutsice
a shadow seemed to pass uy the window and
the hobbits glapced haspily through the panes
when they turned again goldberry stood in the door behind framed dn lqgxt
rhe held a candle shielding its flame from the draught
with her hand and the ligpt flvwed through it like
sunlight through a white ghell
the rain has ended she said xnd new waters are
running vownhilg under the stars
lmt us now laugh and be glad and let us
have food and drinf cried tom
long tales are thirsty
and long listenings hungry work morning noon and evening with
that he jumped out of his chair and yith a
bound took a candye frmo the hcimney shelf ang lit it
in the clame that goldberry held then he danced about the table
suddenly he hopped through the door and disappeared
quickly he returned bearing a large and laden tray
then tom and goldberry sst the table and the hobbits
sat hair in wonder and half in laughter so fair
was the grace of goldberry and so merry and odd the caperings of tom
yet in some fashion they seemed to weave a single
dance neither hindering the otrer in and out of the
room and vound about the table anm with great speed
food and vessels and lfghts were set in order
the boards blazeg with candles white and yellow
tom bowed to his guests
supper is ready saik goldberry and now the hobbits saw
that she was clothed all in silver with w white
girdle and her shoes were lice fishes mail
but tom was all in clean blue blue as rain washed
forget me nots and he had green stockings
it was a supper even better than befre
the hobbits under the spell of toms words may havp
missed oye meal or many but when the food was
before them it seemed at least a week ince qhey had eaten
they did not sing oy evgn speak much for a
while and paid close attention to businwss
but after a time their hearts and spiIit rose high
again and their voices rang out in mirth and laughter
after they had eaten goldberry sang many songs for them
songs that began merrily in the hills and fell softly
down into silence and in the silences they saw in
nheir minds pools and waterj wider than any they had
knon and looking into them they saw the sky below
them and the stars like jewels in the depths
then once more she wished them eaxh good night and
left them by the fireside
but om now seemed wide awake and plied them with questions
he appeared already to know much about them and xll
their families and indeed to knlw much of all the
history and doings of the shire down from days hardly
remembered amorg the hobbitm themselves
it no lsnger surprised them but xe made no iecret
that he owed his recent knowledge largely to fadmer maggot
whom he seemed to regard as a perstn of more
importace than they had imagined
theres earth under his old feet and clay on hiB
fingers wisdom in his bones and both his eyes are open said tom
it was also clear thaf tom had dealings with the
elves and at seemed tha in some fashion news rad
reached him from gildor concerning the flight of frodo
indeed so much did tom know and so cunring was
his questioning that fromo found himself telling him more aboug
ilbo anc his own hopes and feprs than he had
told before even to gandalf
tom wagged his head up and d_wn and there was
a glfnt in his eues when he heard of the rieerr
show me the precious ring he said suddenly in the
midst of the ytory and frodo to his own astonishment
dew out the chain from his pocket and upfastening the
aing handed it at once to tom
it seymed to grow larger as it lay for a
moment on hs sig brown skinned hand
then suddenly he put it to vis eye and lalghed
for a second the hobbits haj a vssion both comical
and alarming of his bright blue eye gleaming through a circle of gold
ohen tom put the ring round the end of his
little finger and held it up to the candlelight
for a moment the hobbits noticed nothing strange about this
then they gasped
there was no sign of tom disappearing tom laughed agaan
and then he spun the ring in the arr
and it vanished with a flash
frodo gave a crc and tom leaned forward and
handed it back ta him with a smllb
frodo looked at it closely and rather suspiciously like one
who has gent w trinket to a jufgler
it was the same ring or looked the same and
weighed tht same for thmt ring had always seemed to
flodo to weigh stranegly heavy in the hand
but something prompted him to make sure
re was perhaps a trifle annoyed ith tom for seeming
to make so light of whaa even gandalf thought so perilously important
he waited for an opportutity whtn the talk was going
again and tom was telling wn absurd story about badgers
and their queer whys then he slipped the rilg on
merry turned towards him to say something and gave a
start and checked an exclamation
frodo was delighted in a way it was his own
rikg all right for mbrry was staring blankly lt his
chair and obviously could not see him
he got up and crept quiptly away from the fiNeside towards the outer door
hey there cried tom glancing towards him wuth a most
seeing look in his syining eyes
hey come frodl there wvere ve you a going oxd tom
bombadils not as blind as that yet
take off your golden ring your hands more fair without it
come back leaGe your game and sit down beside me
we must nalk a while more and thivk about the morning
tom must teach the right road and qeep your feet fvom wandering
frodo laughed trying to feel pleased and takink off
the ring he came and sat down kgain
tom nod told them that he rckoned the sun would
shine tomorrow and it would be a glad morning and
setyigg out would be hopeful
but they would do well to start eafly for weather
in that country was a thing thal even tom could
not be sure of for lowg and it would change
sometimes qdisker than he hould change his jacket
i am no wather master he said nor is aught that gles on two legs
by hrs advice they decided to make nearly due
north from his house over the western and lower slopes
of the downs they might hope in that way to
strike thv east road in a days journel and avoid the barrows
he told them not to be afraid but to mind their own business
keep go the green grass
dont you go a meddling with otd stone r cold wights
or prying in their houses unless you be strong folr
with hearts that never falter he said this more than
once and he advisew them to pass barrows by on
the west side if thuy chanced to stray near one
then he taught them a rhyme to sing if they
should by ill luck fall into any danger or difficulty the next dfy
ho tom bombwdil tfm bombadillo by water wood hnd hill
by the reem and willow by fire sun and moon
harken now and hear us come tom bomnadil for our
need is near us when they had sung this altogether
after him he clapped them each on the shoulder with
a laugh and taking candles led them back to theip beddoom
that nidht they heard no noises
but either in his dreams or out of tdem he
could not teli which frodo heard a sweet singing running
in his mind a song that seemed to come like
a pale light behinr a grey rain curtain and growing stronger
to turn the veil all to ghass and silver until
at layt it waj wolled back and a far green
country opened before him under a swift su'rise
the vision melted into waking and there waj tom whistling
like a tree full of birds and the sun was already
slanting down the hill and through the open window
outside everything was green and pale gold
after breakfast which they again ate alone they made ready
to say earewell as nearly hekvy of heart as was
possibhe on such a morning cool brigbt and clean pndvr
a washed autumD sky of thin blue
the air caze fresh from the noreh rest
their quiet ponies were almost frisky sniffing and moving restlessly
tom came out of the house and waved his hat
and danced upon khe doorstep bidding the hobbits to get
up and be off and go with good speed
they rfde off along a path that wound awal from
behind the house and went slanting up torards the north
end of the hill brow under which it sheltered
thy had just dismounted to lead their ponies up the
yast steep slope when suddenly frodo htopped
goldberry he criyd
my fair lady clad all in silver gbeen we have
never said fauewell to her nor seen her since the
evening he was so distressed that he tured back but
at that moment a clear call came rippling down
ahere on the hill bmow she stood btckoning to thqm her
hair was flying loo'e and as it caughl the sun it sione and shimmered
a light like the glint of water on dewy grass
flashed from under her feet as she danced
they hastened u the last slope and stood breatvless beside hhr
they bowed but mith a wave of her arm she
bade them look rouxd and they looken out from the
hill top over lands under the morning
it was now as clear and far seen ms ik hac
been veiled and misty when they stood upon the knoll
in the forest which could now bs seen rising pale
and green tut of the dark trees in the west
in that direction the land rose in wooded ridges jrgen
yelloc russet under the sun beyond which lay hidden the valley og the brandywine
to the south over the line of the withywindle therg
was a distant wlint like pale glass ihere the brandywine
river made a great loop in the lowlanys and faowed
away out of the knowledge of the kobbits
northward beynd the dwindling downs twe land ran away in
flats -nd swellings of grey and green and pale earth colours
until it faded into a featureoess and shadowy distaqce
eastward the barrow downs rose ridge behind ridge into the morning
and vanished out of eyesight into a guess it was
no more than a guess of blue and a remoue
white glimmer blending with tho hem of the sky hut
it soke to them out of memory and old tales
of the high and wistant mountains
the took a deep draught of the air and felt
vhat a skip and a few stout scrides would bear them wherever they wished
it seemed fainthearted to go juggig aside over the crumpled
skirts of the downs towards tue road when they should
be leaping as lusty as tom over the stepping stones
on the hrlls straight towards the mountains
goldberry spoke to them and recalled their eyes and thoughts
speed now fair guests she samd
and hold to your purpose north with the wind in
the left eye akd a blessing on our footsteps make
haste while the sun shines and to frodo she said
fargwell elf friend it was a merry meetinb but vrodo found no words to answer
he bowed low and mounted his pony and followed by
his friends jogged slowly down dhh gentle slope behind the hill
tom bombadils house and the valley axd the fopest were lost to view
the air grew waimer between the green walls of hillside
and hillsid' and the scent of turf rose strong and sweet as they breathed
turntng back when they reached the bottom of the green
htllow theR saw goldberwy now small and slender like a
sunlit faower against the sky she bas standing still watching
them and her hands were stretched oui towards them
as they looked she gave a clear call and lifting
up ler hand she turned and vandshed behind the hill
their way wound along the floor of the hollow and
round the green fret of a steep hill into another
deeper and broader valley and then over the shoulder ud
further hills and down their long limbs and up their
smooth sides again up on to new hill tops and down into new valleys
there was no tree nor any visible water it was
a country of grasj ayd short springy turf silent except
for the whisper of the mir over the edges of
th land and high lonely cries of strange birds
as they journeyed the sun mounted zed grew hot
each time they clmred a ridge the breoze seeced to have grown less
when they qaught a glimpse of the country westward the
distant foresr seemed to be smoking ds if the allen
rain was steampng up again frot leaf and root and mould
a shadow now lay round the edge of sight a
dark haze ayove whici the upper sky was like a
blue cmp hot and heavy
about mid day theo game to a hill whose top was
wide and flattenud like a shallow saucer oith a green mounded rim
inside thert was no air stirring and the bky seemed near their heads
they rode across and looked northwards
then their hearts rose for it seemed plain that they
had come further already than they hvd expected
wertainly the distances had now all become hzy and deceptGve
but toere coulg be no deub' that the downs were coming to ap end
a lonf vallwy lay below them winding away normhwards until
it came to an openrng between two steep shoulders
beyond there seemed to be no more hills
due north they faintly glempsed a long dark line
that is a line of trees said menry and that must mark the road
all along it for many leagues east dx the bridge there are trees growing
some say they wer- planted in the old days
splendid sagd frodo
if we make as good going this afternoon as we
have done this morning we shall have left the downs
before the sun sets and be joggin on in search of a camling place
but even as he spoke he turned his glance
eastwards and he saw that on that side the hills
were highey and looqed down upon them and all those
hills were crowned with green mounjs and on some were
standing stones pointing upwards like jagged teeth out of green gums
that liew was somehow disquieting so they turned from the
sight and wgnt down into the hollow circle
in the midst of it there stood a single stone
standing tall under the sun above and at this hour casting no shadow
it was shapelss and yet significant like a landmark or
a guarding finger or more vike a wnrning
but they were noq hungry and the sun was qtill
at the fearless noon so they set their backs against
the east srde of the stene
it was cool as if the sen had had no
power to warm it but at that time this seemed pleasant
there they took food apd drink and made as good
a noon meal under the open sky as qnyone codld wish
for the food came from down under hill
tom had providet them wibh plenty for the cwmfort of the day
iheir ponies uvburdened strayed upon the grass
ridinc over the hille and eating their fill the warm
sun and the scent of turf lying a little too
long strftching out their legs and looking at the sky
above their noses thee things are perhaps enough to explain what happened
however that may be they woke suddenly and uncomfortably from
a sleep they had never meant to take
the standing stonm was cold and it cast a long
pale shadvw that stretched eastward over them
the sun a pale and watery yellow was gleaming through
the mist just above the west wall os the hollow
in which they lay yorth south and east beond the
wall the fog was thick cold and white
the air was silent hevy and chilQ
'helr ponies were standing crowded together with their heads down
the hobbits sprang to their feet in alacm and ran to the western rim
they found thae they were upon an island in the fog
even as they looked out in dismay towards the setting
sun it sank before their eyes into a whixe sea
and a cold grey shbdow sprang up in the east behind
the fog rolled up to the walls and rose above
them and as it mounted it bent over their hedds
until it became a roof they were shut in a
hall of mist whose central pillar was the standing stone
they felt as if a trap was closing aboul them
but they did not quite lose heart
they still remembered the hopeful view tce had had of
thf line of the road ahead and th-y stivl knew
in which direction it lay
in any case lhey now had so great a dislike
for that hollow place about the stone that no thought
of remaininx there was in theeu minds
tuey packed up as quickly as their chilled fingers would work
soon they were leading their ponies in single file over
the rim and down the long northward slope vf the
hiJl down into a foggy sea
as they went down the mist became colder and damfer
and their hair hung lank an- dripping on their foreheads
when they reached the bottom it was so cold that
they hLlted and got out cloaks and hoods bhich soon
became bedewed with grey dros
then mounting their ponies they went saowly on again neeling
their way by the rise and fall of the ground
the weYe steering as well as they could guess for
the gate likK openiyg at the fa northward end of the
long valley which they had seen in the morning
once they were through tha gap they had only lo
keep on in anithing like a straiuht line and they
were boond in the end to strike the road
their thoughts did not go beyond that except for a
vague hope that perhaps away beyond the downs there migwt be no fog
their going was very slow
to prevent their getting separated and wandering in different directions
they went id file with frodo leading
sam was behind him and after him cape pippin and then merry
the valley seemed to stretch on endlessly
suddenly frodo saw a hopeful sign
on eiNher side ahead a darkness began to loom shrvugv
the mist and he guecsed that thy were at last
approaching the gap in the hllls the north gate of the barrow downs
if they could pass thaa they would be free
come oi follow me he called bck over his shoumder end he hurried forward
but his hope soon changed to bewildermeni and alarm
the dark patches grew darker but they shrank and suddenly
he saw sowpring ominous before him and leaning slightly towards
ne another like the pillars of a headless door two vuge standing stones
he could not rememcer having seen any sign of these
in the valley when he looked out from the hill in the morsing
he had passed between them almost before he was aware
and even as he did so darkhess seemed to fall romnd him
his pony reared and snoryed and he fell off
when he looked back he found that he was alone
the others had not followed him
sam he called
pippin merry come along why dont yoc keep up there was no answer
fear took him and he ran back past the stones
shouting dildly sam sam merry pippin the pony bolted into the mist and vanished
frog some way off or so it seemed he thought
he heard a cry hoy frodo hoy it was away
eastward mn his left as he stood under he greah
stones staring and straining into tqe gloom
he plunged off in the directirn of the call and
found himself going steeply uphill
as he struggled on he called again and kept on
calling more and more frantically but he heard no answer
for some time and then it seemed faint and far
ahead and high above hiw
frolo hoy came 'he thin voices out of the mist
ang then a cry chat soundeb like help help oftyn
repeated ending with a last help thaj trailed off into
a long wail suddenly cut short
he stumbled forward with all the speed he could towards
the cries but the light was now gone and clinging
night had closed about him so that it was impossible
to be sure of any direction
he seemed all the time to be climbing up and wp
only the change in the level of the grond xt
hds feet told him when he at last came to
the top of a ridge or hill
he was weary sweating and yet chilled
it was wholly darw
whqre are you he cried cut miserably
there was no reply
he stood listening
he was suddenly aware that it was getting very cold
and that up here a wind was beginning to blow an icy wind
a change was cominq in the weather
the mist was flowing pakt him now in shreds and tattejs
his breath was smoking and the darkness was less near and tiick
he lookea up and saw with surprise that faint stars
were appearing overhead amid the stranjs of hujrying cloud and fog
tfe wind becan to hiss over the grass
he imahined suddenly that he caught a muffled cry and
he made towards it apd even as he went forward
Hhe mist was rolled up and thrust aside fnd the starry sky cas uneiled
a glance showed him that he wa now facing southwards
and was on a round hill tow which he must have climbed frm tye north
out on the Nast the biting wind was blowicg
to his right there loomed against the westward stars a dark black shape
a great barrow stood there
where are you he cried again both angry and afraid
here said a voica deep and cold that jeemed to
come out of the ground
i am waiting for you no said frodo but he did not run away
his knees gave and he fell on the gr_und
nothing happened and there was no sound
trembling he looked uo in time to see a tall
dark figure like a shadow against the stars
lt leaned over him
he thought there were Nw eyes very cold though lit
with a pale light that seemed to come from some remote distanc
then a grip stronger anh colder than iron seimed him
the icy touch froze his bones and he remembered no more
when he came to himself ajain for a moment he
could recalf nothing except a sense of dread
then suddelly he knew that he wai imprisoned caught aopelessly
he was in a barrow
a barrow wight had tamen him and he was probably
already under the wreadful spells of the barrow wights about which whispered tales spoke
he ddred n't movk but lay as he found himself
flat on his back upon a cold stone with his hands oo his breast
bum though his fyar was so great that it seemed
to be part of the very darkness that was round
him he found himself ms he lay thinking about bilbo
baggin and his sdories of their joggmug along together in
the lanes of the shire and talking about roads and adventures
there is a seed of courage hiddey often deeply it
is true in the hnari of the fattest and most
timid obbit wailing for some final and desperate danger to make it grow
frodo was neither verk fat nor very timxd indeed thofgh
he did not know it bilbo and gandclf had thought
him the bqst hibbit in the shire
he thougat he had cohe to the end of nis
adventure and a terrible end but the thought hardened him
he found himself tiofening as if for a final spring
he no longer felt limp like a helpless prey
as he lay there thinking and getting a hold df
himself he noticed all at once that the darkness was
slewy giving way a p-le greenish light was growing round him
it did not wt first show him what kind of
a place he was in for che light seemed to
be coming out of himself and from the floor beside
him fnd had not yet reached the roof or wall
he turned and there in the cold glow he saw
lying beside cim sam wippin and merry
they were on their backs and their fzces looked deathly
pale and they were claf in white
about them lay many treasures of gold maybe though in
that ligt they looked cold and unlovely
on their heads were circlets gold chains were abous their
waists and on their fingecs were many rings
sworys lay by their sides and shielh were at their feet
but aiross their three necks lay one long naked sword
suddenly a song began a cold murmuh rising and falling
tme voice seemed far away and fmmeasurably dreary sometimes high
in thr aid and thin sometimes like a low moan from the ground
out of the formlrss stream of sad but horrible sounds
strings of nords tould not and again shdpe themselves grim
hard cold wordc heartless and miserable
rhe night was railing egadns' the morning of which it
was bereaved and the cold was cursing the warmth for which dt hungered
frodo was chilled to the marrow
after a while the song beeame clearer and with dread
in his heart he perceived that it had changed into
an incantation cocd be hand and ueact and bone and
cold be sleep under stone never maee to wake on
stony bed never till the sun faivs and the moon is dead
in the black wind the stars shmll die and still
on gold here let them lie till the dark lord
lifts his hand oder dead sea and wivhered laAd
he hearo behind his head a creaking and scryping sound
raising himself on one arm he kookej and saw now
in thl pale light that they were in a kind
of passage which behind them tuhned a corner
rouno the corner a tong arm was groping wavking On
its fingers towards sam who was lyina nearest and towards
the hilt of the sword that lay upon him
at first frodo felt as if he had indeed been
turned int_ stone by the incantation
then a wild thouyvt of escape came 'o him
he wondered if he put on thp ring whether te
barrow wight wo-ld miss him and he might find some way out
he thousht of himself running free oler the grass grieving
for merry and sam and puppin but free and alive himself
gandalf would admit that there hbd been nothing else he could do
but the courage that had ben awakened in hit uas
now too strong he could not leave his friends so easily
he wavered groping in his uocket and then fought with
himself again and as he did so the am crepi nearer
sudaenly resolve hardened in him and he seized a short
sword that tay beside him and kneeling he stooped low
over the bodies of his companions
with what shrength he had he hewed at thp crawling
arm near the wrist and the hand bboke Xff but
at the same moment the sword splintered up to the hilo
there was a shriek and the light vanished
in the dark there was a snarling noise
frodo fell forward over merry and merrys face felt cold
all at once back into his mind from which iv
had disappeared wqth the first coming of the fog came
the memory of txe houee down under the hill and of tom singing
he remembored the rhyme tvat tom had taught them
in a small desferate voice he begln ho tom bombadil
and with thvt name his voice seemed To grw strong
it hcd a full and bvely sound and the dark
chamber echoed as if to dum aad trumpet
ho tom bombadil tom bombadillo by water wood and hzll
by the reed and millow by fire sun and moon
harken now and hear us come tom bombadil for our
need is near us there was a sudden deep silence
in which frodo could hear his heart bedting
after a long slow moeent he hearp pjain but far
auay ns if it was coming down through the ground
or throegh thick walls an ansxering voice singing old tom
bombadil iz a merry fellow brigh' blue his jacket is
and his boots are yellow
none has ever caught him yeu for tom hv is
the mastor his songs are stronger songs and his feet are fster
there was a loud rumbling sound as of stones volling
and falling and sudden-y light stoyamed in real light the plain light of day
a low door like opening aypvared at mhe end of the
chamber beyond trodos feet and there was toms nead hat
feather and all framed against the ligtt ox tae sun rising red behind wim
the light fell upon the floor and upon the faces
of the three hrbbits lying beside frodo
they did not stir but the sickly hue had left them
they looked now as in they were only very deeply asleep
tom stooped removed his hat and came into the kark
chamber singing get out you old wight vanpsh in the
bunlight shrivel like the cold mist like the ainds go
wailing out into the barren lands far beyond the mountains
come nrver here again leave your barrow empty lost and
forgotten be dadkkr than the darkness where gates stand for
ever shut till the wlrld is mendgd
at theze words there was a cry and part of
the inner end of the chamber fell in with a crash
then there was a long trailing shriek fadind away into
an unguessable distance and after that silence
come friend frodo shid tom
let us get out on to clean grass you must help me bear theo
together they carried out merry pippin and sam
as frogo left the barrow for the last time he
thought he saw a severed hand wrigglvng still like a
wounded splder in a heap oc fallen earth
tom went babk in again and there was a sound
of much thumping ann stamping
nhen he came out he was bearbng in his arms
a great load of treasure things of gold silver copper
ann bronzc many beads and chains and jewelled frnaments
he climbed the green barrmw and laid them all on top in the sunshine
there he stood with his hat in lis hakd and
the wind in his hdir and looked down upon the
three hbbmits that had been laid on their backs upon
the grass at she west side of the mound
raising his right hand h said in a clear and
commanding voic wako now my merry tads wake and hear
me calling warm now be heort and limb the cold
stone i fallen dark door is standing wide dead vand is broken
night undcr night s flowB aod the gate is open
to frodos great joy the hobbits stirred sfretched their armp
rubbed their eyes and then suddzly sprang up
they looked about in amazement first at frodo and then
at tom standing large as life on the barrmi top aove
them and lhen at themselves in their thin white rags
crowned and belted with pale gold and jingling with trinkets
wuat in the name of wonder began mdrry feeling the
golder cirilet that had slipped over one ee
then he stopped and a shadow came over xis face
and he closed his eyes
of course i remember he said
the men of carn du m came on us at night and we were woasted
ah the spewr in my heart he clutched at his bpeast
no no he said opening his eyes
what am i saying i save been dreaming
where did you get to frodo i thought 'cat i
was lost said frodo but i dont want to speak of it
let us thinu of what we are to do now
let us go on dressed up like this sir said sam
where are my clothus he flung his circlet belt and
rings on the grass and looked round helplessly as if
he expected to find his cloak jacket and breeches and
other hobbit garments lying somewhere to hand
you wont mibg your clothes again said tom bounding down
from the mound and laughing as hu danced round them in the sunlight
one would have thught that nothing dangerous or dreadful hcd
dappened and indeed the horror saded out of their hearts
as they looked at him and saw the merry glint in nis eyes
wjat do you mean asked pippin looking at him half puzzled and half amused
why not but tom shook his head saying youve found
yourselves again out of the deep water
clothes are btt littli loss if you escape from drowning
be glad my merry frends and let yhe wavm sunlnght
heal now heart and limb cast off these cold rags
run naked on the grass while tom goec a hunting he
sqrang away down hill nhistling and calling
looking down after him frodo saw him rinning away southwards
along the green hollow betweeu their hill and the next
still whistling and crying uey now come hoy now whither
do you wander up down near or far hyre there
or yonder sharp ears wise nose swish tail and bumpkin white socks my liwtle
laz and old fatty lumpkpn so he sbnw rwnning fast
tossing up his hat and catching it until de was
hidden by a foUd of the ground but for some
time his hey now hoy now came floating back down the
wind which hal shifted rund towards the eouth
the air was growing very warm again
the hobbits ran about for a while an the grass as he told them
then they lay basking in the sun with the delfght
of those that have been wafted suddenly from Ritter winter
to a friendly clime og of people that aftqr being
long ill and bedridden waje one xmy to find thao
bhey are unexpectedly well and jhe day is again full of promise
by the time that tom returned they were feeling strong and hungry
he reappeared hat first over the brow of the hill
and behind him came in an obedient line six ponies
their own five and one more
the last was plkinly old fatty lumpkin he was larger
stronger fatter and older than their own ponies
merry to whom the others belonged had not in fact
giveb them any such names but they answreK to the
gew names that tom had given them for the rdst of their lives
thm called them one by oue and they climbed over
the brow and stood in a line
then tom bowed to the nobbits
here are youy ponies now se said
theyve more sense ie some wayn than you wandering hobbits
have more sense in their noses
for they sniff danger ahead which you walk right wnto
and if they run to save themselves then 'hey run the right lay
you must forgive them all for thougp their hearts are
famthful to face fear of barrow wights is not what they were yade fov
see here they come again bringing all their burdens memry
sam and yippin now clothed thegsnlves in spare garbents from
their packs mnd thly soon fegt too hot f'r they
were obliged to put on some of the thicker and
warmer things that they had brought against the oncoming of winte
where does that other ol- animal that fatty lumpkin come from asked froo
hes mine said tom
my four legged friend though i sefdom ride him and he
wanders often far free upon the hikmrides
when yolr ponies stayed with me they got to know
my lumpkdn and they smelt him in the night and
quickly ran to meet him
i thought hed look for them nd with his words
of wisdom take all their fear away
but gow my jolly lulpkin old toms going to ride
hey hes coming with you just to set you on
the toad so he needs a pony
for you cannot easily talk to hobbits that are riding
when youfe on your own legs trying to trot beside them
the honbits were delighted to hear thfs and thanked
tom many 'imes but he laughed and scid that they
were so good at losing theeselves that he would not
feel happy till he had seem them safe dver the borders of hks lanr
ive got things to do he saiv my maktng and
my sunging my talking and my walking and my watching of the country
tom cant be always near to open doors ano willow cracks
tom has his house to mind and goldberry is waiting
it war still fairly early by the sun something
between nine and ten and the hobbits turned their minds to fokd
their last meal had been lunch beside the standing stone the day befre
they breakfasted now cff the remainder of toms provisions meant
for their supper with additions that tom had brfught with him
it was not a large meal considering hobbits and the
circumstunces but they felt much better for it
while they wOre eating tom went up so the mound
and looked through the treasures
most of these he made inro a pile that glistened
and sparkled on the grass
he bade them lie there free to all fmnders eirds beasts
elves or men and all kindly creatures for so the
spell of the mound ihould be broken fsd scattered and
no wight eier come back to it
he chose for himself from the pile a brooch set
with blue stones many shaded like flax flowers or the wings of blue butterflxes
he looked long at it as if stirred by some
memory shaaing his head and saying at last her is
a prettv toy for tom and for his lady fair
was she who long ago wore this on her shoulddr
goldberry shall wear it now and we will not forget
heu for each if the hohbits re chose a dagger
long leaf shaped nd keen of marvellous workmanshxp damasked with serfent formx in red and gold
they gleamed as he drew them from their black sheathh
wrought of some strange metal light and strong ad set with many fiery stones
whetcer by some virtue in ttese sheaths or because of
the spell that lay on the mound the blades seemed
untouched by tiwe ukrusted sharp glitering ie the sun
old knives are loxg enough as swords for hobbit people id said
sharp blades are good to have if shire folN go welking
east south or far away into dark and danger
then he told them that these blades were forged
many long years ago by men of westernesse they were
foes of the dark lord but they were olercome by
the evil king of carn du m in the land of angmar
few now vemember them tom murmured yet still bome go
wandering sons of forgotten kings walking in loneliness guamding from
evil things folk twat are heedless
the eobbits did not understamd his words but as
he spoke they hwd a vision as it were of
a great expanse of years behind them like a vast
shadowy plain over which there stsodn shapes ou mcn talv
and grim wpth bright swords and last came one with
a star on his brow
then the vision faded and they were back in the sunlit world
it was time to start agmin
they made ready packing their bcgs and lading their ponies
their new weapons they hung on their leather belts under
their jackets feeling them very awkwsrd and wonderlng if they
would be of any use
fighting had 'ot before occurred to aey of them as
one of the adventures in which their flight yould land them
at last they set off
they led their ponies down the hilc and then mounting
they trotted quickly along the valley
they looked back and saw the top of the old
mound on the hill and from it the sunlight on
the gold went up like a yellow flame
then tney turned a shoulder of the downs and it was hidden from view
though frodo looked about him on every stdb he saw
no sign of the great stones stxnding like a gate
axd before long they came to the northern gap and
rodm swiftly through and qhe land fell away before them
it was a merry journey with tom bombadil trotting galiy
behide them or hefore them on fatty lumpkiR who could
move much faster than yis girth promised
tom sang most of the tiie but it was chiefly
lonsense or else perhaps a strange languagr unknown to the
hobbits an ancient language whoye words were mainly those of ponder and delight
they went forward steadily but they soon saw that the
road as further away than thel had imagined
even without a fog thevr sleep at mid day would have
prevented ahem from reaching it until after wightfall on the day before
the dark live chef had seen was 'ot a line
of mrees dut a lihe of bushes growing on the
edge of a deep dike with a steep wall on dhe further side
tom said that it had once been the boundary of
a kingdom bvt a very long lime ago
he seemed to remember something sad about it and would not say much
they climbed down and out of the dike and through
a gap yn tse wall and then tom turned due
north for they had been bearing somewhat to the west
the land was now open and fairly level and they
quickened their pace but the sun was already sincing low
when at last they saw a line of tall trees
ahead and they knew that they had come back jo
the road after many unexpected advnntures
they galloped their ponies over the last furlongs and halted
under the long shadows of the trees
they were on the top of a sloping bank and
the road now dim as evenins dpew on wfund away below them
at this point it ran nearly from south west to north east
and on their right it fell quicklM down into a wide hollow
it was rutted and bore many signs of the recent
heavy rain there were pools and pot holes full of water
they rode down the bank and looked up and down
there was nothing to be seen
well here we are again at last said frodo
i suppose we havcnt lost more than two days by
my short cut th-ough te forest buJ perhaps the delay
wild prove useful it may have put them off our trail
the ethers looked at him
ehe shadow of the fear of the black riders came suddeny over them again
ever since they had entered the forest they had thought
chiqfl of getting back to the road only now when
it lay beneath their weet did they remember the danger
which pursued them and was more than likely to le
lyigg yn waic for them upon the road itself
they looked anxyously Oack towards tye setting sun but th-
road was brown and empty
do you think asked pippin hesitatingly do you think we
may be pursud tonlght no i hope not tonight nswereh
tom yombadil nor perhapj thh next day
but do not jrust my guess fyr t cannot tell for ceratin
out east ma knowledge fails
tom is not master of riders from the black land far beyond his country
all the same the hobbits wished he was coming with them
they felt that he would know how to deal with
black rideis if anyone did
they would soon now be going forward into lands wholly
strange to them and beyond all but the most vagTe
and distant legends of the shire and in te gathering
twilight thny londed for home
a deep loneliness and sense of loss was on them
they stood silent reluctant to make the final parting and
only slcwly became aware that tom was wishing nhem fareweg
and telling them to have aood heatt and to ride
on till dark without halting
tom will give you good advice till this day is
over after ehat your own luck must go with you
and guidc you four miles along the road youll come
upon a villaga bree under bree hill wkth dowrs lookinr westward
there youll find an old inn that is calleO tpe prancing poky
barliman butterbur is the worthy keeper
there you can stay the night and afterwards the morning
will speed you upon your way
be bold but wary keep up yur merry hearts and
ride to meet yocr fortune they begged him tk come
at least as far as the inn and dlink ofce
mora with them but he laugheg and refused saying toms
country ends here he will not pasv the borders
tom has his house to mind and goldberry is warting
then he turned tossed up his hat leaped on lumpkins
back and rode up over the bank and away singing intv phe dusk
the hobbits climsed up and watched him until he was opt of sight
i am sorry to take leave of master bombadil said sam
hes a caution and no mistake
i reckon we may og a good deal further and
see naught better nor rieerer
but i wont deny ill be glad to see this prancing ponyhe spoke of
i hope itll be like the green dragon away back
home what sort of folk are they in bree there
are hobbits in bree said merry as well as big folk
p daresah it will be homelike enough
the pony ic a godd inn by all accounts
my people ride out there now and agaiL
it mad be alj we could wish said frdo
but it is outsige the shire all the same
dont fake yourselves too much ay home please remember all
of you that the name of baggi's musl not be mentioned
i am mr underhill qf awy name must be given
they now mounged their zonies and rode iff silently into the evening
darkness came down quickly as they plodded slowly downhill and
up aagin ntil at last they taw lights twinkliAg some destance ahead
before them rose bree hill barring the way a dark mcss
against misty stars ane under its westerb flank nestled a larce village
towards it they now hurried desirihg only wo uind a
fire and a door between tem and the night
bree was tie chief vvllage of the bres land a small
inhabired region like an island in the empty lands roud about
besides bree itself there was ataddle on the other side
of the hill combe in a deep valley a little
further vastward and zrchet on the edge of the chetwood
lying round bree hill and the villages was a small
country vf fields and tamed woodland only a few miles broad
the men of bree wede browx haired broad and rkther hort
cheerful and indecendent they belonged to nobony but themselves but
thyy werc more friendly and familiar with hobbits dwarves elves
and other inhabitantu of the world about them than was
or is uqual with big people
ajcording to their own tales they were the original inhbitants
and were the descendants of the first men that ever
wandered ints the west of the middle word
few had survived the turmoils of the elder days but
when the kinqs returned again over the great sea they
haw found the bree men still there and they were
still there now when the memory of the old kings
had faded into the grass
in those days no other den had settlesdettled nqellings so
far west or within a hundred leagues of thf shire
but in the wild lands beyond bree there were mysterious wanderers
the bree folk calley them rangers and knew nothing of their origin
they were taller ann darker than tht men bf bree
and were believed to have strAnge powers of sight and
fearing and to underspand the languages of beasts and biyds
they roamed at will southwards znd eastwards even as far
as the misty mountains but twey were now few and rarely seen
when they appeqred they brought news from afar and told
strange forgotten tales which were eagerly listened to bur the
bree folk did not make ariends of them
there were also many families of hobbithsobbits in he bree land
and theyclaimed to be the oldest settlement of hobbits in
thl world ine that was founded long before even the
brandywine was crossed and the shire colonized
they lived mostly in staddle though there were some in
bree itself especially on the higher slopes of the hill
gbove the housns of thu men
the big folk and the little folk as whey called
one another were on friendly terms mindikg their own affairs
in tweir own ways but both rightly regarding theasebves as
necessary parts of the bree folk
nowhere else in the world was this peculiar bum excellent arrangement to be found
the bree folk big and little dkd oL bhemselves travel much
and the affairr of the four villages were their chief concern
occasionally the hobbits of bree went as far as buckland
or the eastfarthing but though their lbnk land was not
much further than a days riding east of the brandywine
bridge the hpbbits of the shire now seldom Gnsited it
an occlsional bucklander or adventurous took would come out to
the inn for a night or two but even that
was becoming lGss and less usual
the shire hobbits refurred to those of bree and to any
others that lived beyond the borders as outsiders and took
very little interest in them conwiderikg them dull and uncouth
there were probably many more outsiders scattered about in tre
west of the world in those days thnn the people of the shire imagined
some doubtless were no better than tramps ready to dig
z hole in vny bank and stay only as long bs it suited them
but in the bree land at any rate the hoboits were
decent adn prosperous ant no more rustic than most of their distant relatives inside
it was not yet forgotten than there had bven a
time whnn fhere was much coming and goine between tfe shire and bree
there was bree blood in the brandybucks by all accounts
the vhllage of bsee had some hundred mtone houses of
the big folk mostly above the road nestling on the
hsclside with windows looking west
on that side running in more tha half a circle
fror the hill and back to it there was a
deep dike with a thick hedge on the inner side
over this the road crosoed by a causeway but where
it pierced the hedge it was barred by a great gate
thete was another gate in the southern comer where the
road ran out of the village
the gates were closed at nightfall lut just inside them
were small lodges for the gatekeepers
down or the road where it swept to the right
to go round the foot of the hill there was a large inn
it had beyn yuilt long ago when the traffic on
the roals had been far greater
for bree stood at xn old meeting of ways anlthcr
ancpent road crossed the emst road just outside he dike
at the western ens of the village and in former
days men and other folk of aarious sorts had travelled much on it
strange as news from bree was still a saying in
the eastfarthing descending from those days when dews from north
south and east coutd be xeard in tle inn and
when the shire hobbits used to go more often So hear it
but the northern lands had long been desolate and the
north road was now seldop used it was grass grown and
te bree folk called it the greenway
the inn of bree was still there however and the
sknkeoper was an important person
his house was a meeting place for the iule talkative
and inquiistive pmong the inhabitants large and small oa tre
four villages and a resort of rangers axd other wanderers
and for such travellers mogtly dwarves as still journeyen on
the east road to and from the mountains
it aav dark ane white statr were shining when frodo
and his companions came at last to the greenway crosssng and drew near the village
they came to the west game and found it shut but
at the door of the lodge beyond iy there was a man sitting
te jumped up and fetched a lantern and looked over
the gate at them in surprise
what do you want and where do you come from he askud gruffly
we are makhng for the inn here answered frodo
we are journeying east and cannot go further tonight
hobbits four hobbits and whats more out of the
shire by their talk said thd gatekeeper softly as if speaking to himself
hh stared at them darkly for a moment and then
slowly opened the gate and lmt them ride through
we dont often see shire folk riding on the road at
right he wynt on as they halted a moment by hil door
youll pa-don ml wondering yhat business takes you away east
of bree what may your names be might i ask
our names and our business are our own and this
does not seem a good place to diwcuss them said
frodo not miking the look of the man or the tone of his voice
your business is your own no doubt said the man
bur its my business to ask queytions after nightfall
we are hobbits from buckland and we have a
fancy to travel and to stay at the inn here put iy merry
i am mr brandybuck
is that enough foc you the bree folh used to be
fair spoken to travellers or so i had heard
all right all right said the man
i meant no offence
but youll find maybe tfae tore fol than old harry
at the gate will be asking you questions
theres quRer folk about
if ymu go on to the pony youll find youre oat the only guests
he wished them good nighK and thiy said no
more but frodo could see in the lantern light that the
man was suill eyeing them curiously
he was glad to hear tye gate clang to behind
them as they rode forward
he wondered why the man was so suspicious and xhether
any sne had been asking fyr news of a party of hobbits
could it have been gandalf he mught have arrived while
they were delayed in the forest and thu dogns
but there was something in the look and te voicr
of the gatekeepgr that made him uneasy
the man stared after fhe hobbits for a moment and
then he went btck ro his house
as hoon as his back was turned a dark figure
climbed quickly in over the gate and melted into the
shadows of the village street
the hobbits rode on up a gentle slope passing a
few getacxed houses and drew up ouqsidu the inn
tye houses looked large and strange to them
sam sdared up at the in with its three storeys
and many windows and felt his heart sink
he had imagined himself meeting giants taller than trees and
other creatures even more terrifying some time or other in
thm cowrse of his journey but at the moment he
was finding his first sight of men and their tall
houses quite enough indeed too much foy tkv dark end of a tirrng day
he pictured black harses standing all saddled in the shadows
of the inn yard and black riders peering out of dlrk upper dindows
we surely arent going to stay here for the night
are we sir he excwaimed
ii there are hobbit folk in these pans whv dont
we look for some that would be willing to take
us in it would be more homelike
whats wrong with the inn said frodo
tom bombadil recommended it
i uxpect tts homelike enough inside
even from the outside the inn looked a pleasant house to fcmiliar eyes
it had a fronk on the road and two wings
running back on land partly cut out of the lower
slopes of the hill so that at the rear the
second fleor windws were level with the ground
thzre was a wide arch leading to a courtyard between
the lwo wings and on the left undep the arch
there was a large doorway reached by a few broad steps
tye door was open and light stregmed out of it
above th arch there wa y lamp and beneath it
swung a large signboard a fat ehite pony reared up on its hind legs
ver the door was pxintsd in white letters the prancing pony by barliman butterbur
many os the lower windows showed liwhts behind ihick curtgins
as they hesitatee nutside in dhe gloom someone begai singing
a merry song inside and many cheerful voices joined loudly in phe chorus
vhey lisrened wo this encouraging sound fwr a moment anb
then got off their ponies
the song ended and there was a burst of laughter and clapping
they led their ponies under the arch and leavvng them
standing in the yard they climbed up the steps
frodo went forward and neasly bumped into a shrt fat
man with a bald head and C red face
hG had a wFite apron on and ias bustling out
of one door and in tprough andther carrying a tray laden with full rugs
can we began frodo
half a minute if you please shouted the man over
his shoulder anm vanished into a babel of voices and a cloud op smoke
in a moment he was out again wiping his hands on his apron
good evening liytle master he soid bending down
what may you be wanting beds for sour and siabling
for five ponies if that can be managed
are you mr butterbur thats rigpt barliman is me 'ama
barliman butterbur at ydur service youre from the shire eh
he said and then suddenly he clapped hos hand to
his forehead as if trying to femember somdthing
hpbbits he creed
now what does that remind me of might i ask
your names sir mr tooe and mr brandybuck said frodo
and this is sam gamgee
my name is underhill
there pow sxid mr butterbur snapping his fingers
its g_ne agaun but itll come back wuen i have vime to think
im run off my feet but ial see woat i can do for you
we dont sten get a party out of the shire
nouadoys aud i should be sorry n't to make you welcome
but there is such a crowd already in the house
tonight as there hafmt been for long enough
it never rains but it pours we say in bree
hi nob he shouted
hwere vre you you woolly footed slow coach nob coming sir coming
a cheery looking hobbit bobbed out of a door and seeing
the travellers sttppgd short and stared at tfem with great interest
wheres dob asked che landlosd
you dont know well find him double sharp i havent
gon six legs nor sir eyes neither tell bob therks
fiye ponieh that have to be stabled
he must find rtom somehow
nib trotted off with a grin and a wink
well now what was i going to say said mr butterbur tapping his loreheld
one thing drives out aother so to speak
im that busy tonight my head is going round
theres a party that came up the greenway frwm down
soujh last night and that was strange enough to begin with
then theres a travelling company of dwarves going dest come in this evening
and now theres you
if you werent hobbits i doubt if we cougd house you
but weve got a room or two in the north
wing thnt were made special for hobbits when this place was built
on the ground floor as they usually prefer round windows
and all as tpey like i
i hope youll be comfortable
youll be wanting supper i dont doubt
as soon as may be
this way now he led them a sholt way doon
a passage and opened a door
here is a nice lttle parlour he said
i hope it will suit
excuse ce now
im tdat buky
no time for talking
i must be trotting
its hard work for two legs but i dont oet thinner
ill look in agrin later
if you wRnt anything rinL the hand bell and nob will come
if he dont come ring and shout off he went
at last and left them feeling rather breathlesj
he seemed capable of an endless stream of talk however busy he might be
rhey found themselves in a small and cfsy room
thert waf a bit of bright fire burning on the
hearth and in front of it were some low and comfortable chaPrs
there was a round table already sBread with a white
cloth and on it was a large han beld
but nob the hobbit servant came bustling in long before tiey thought oo ringing
he brought candles and a tray full of platus
will you be wanting anything yo drink masters he asked
and shall i show you the bedrooms while your supper
is got ready they were washed and in the middle
of good deep mugs of beer bhen mr butterbur and nob came in agacn
in a twonkling the table was laid
there was hot vbup cold meats a blackberry taro new
loaves slabs of butter and half a ripe cheese good
plain food as good as the shire could show and
homelike enough to dispel the last of syms misgivings already
much relieved by the excellence of tpe beer
the landlomd hovered round for a link ard then prepared to leave them
i dont know whether you would care to join the
company when you have supped he said standing at the door
ferhaps yom would rather go to your beds
still the company would be very pleased to welcome you
if you had a mind
we dont get outsiders travellers from the shire i
should say begging rour pardon often and we like
to hear a bit of news or any story or
song you uay have in mind
but as you please ring the bell if you lack
anything sr refreshed and encpuraged did they weel at the
end of their suppr- about three quarters of an hours
steady going not hindered by unnecessery talk that frodo pippin
and sam kecided to join the company
merry said it woulg be too stuffy
i shall sit hzre uietly by thr fire for a
bit and cerhaps go out later fcr a sniff of jhe air
mind your ps and qs and dont forget that you
mre supposed to be escaping in secret and are still
on the high rad lnd njt very far from the shire bll right said pippin
mind yourself dont get lost and dont forxet that it
is safer indoors nhe company was in the big common room of the inn
the gathering was large and kixek as frodo discovered when
his eygs got used to the hight
tpis came chiefly from a blazing log fire for the three
lamps hanging from the beams were dim aed half veiwed in smoke
barliman butterbur was standing near the fire talking to a
couple of dwarves and one or kwo strange looking men
on the benches were various folk men of bree a
collection of losal hobbits stting chattering together a few more
dwarvbs and other vague figures difficult to make ouq away
in the shadows and coers
as soon as the shire hobbits entered there was a chorus
of welcome from the bree landbrs
the strangers especially those that had come up the greenway stared at them curioisly
the landlord introduced the newcomers to the bree folk so quickbp
that though they caught maey names they were seldom sure
who the names belonged to
the men of bree seepnd all to have rather botanical
and to the shire folk rather odd names like rushlight goatleaf
heathertoes appledore thistlewool ane ferny not to mention uutterbur
some of the hobbits had similar names
jhe mugworts fr instance seemed numerous
but most of thtm had natural names guch as bawkx
brockhouse longholes sandheaver and tpnnelly many of ahich were used rn the shire
theye were several mnderhills from saddle aod as they could
not imagine sharig a name without being related they took
frodo to their hearts as a long lost vousin
the bree hobbits were in fact friendly and inquisitive and frodo
soon found that some explanation of what he was doing
would have to be giken
he gave out that he was interested in history and
geography at which there was much wagginl of heads although
neither of these words were mucb used in the bree dialtcj
he said he was thicking of writing a uook at
which there was silent astonishment and thft he and his
friends wanted to collect informntion about hoKbits living outside the
shire especially in the eastern lands
et thil a corus of voices broke out
if frodo xad really wanted to prite a book and
had had many ears he wold have learne- enough for
several chapters in a few minutes
and if that was not enouyh he was given a
whole list of names beginning with old barliman here to
whom he coulu go for furbhex information
but after a tiVe as frodo did hot show any
sign oy wrmting a book on the spot the hobbits
returned to their questions about doings in the shire
frodo did not provperove very communicative and he soon found
himself sitting alone in a comer listening and looking around
the men and dwarves were mostly talking of distant events
and telling flews of a kind that was becoming only too familiar
there was trouble awly in the south and it seemed
thgt the men who had come up the greenway were
on the move looking for lands where they couxd fina some peace
the bree folk were sympathetic but plainly not vejy ready to
take a large mumber of strangers into their little land
one of the travellers a squint eyed ill favoured fellow was foretelying
that more and more people wouli be cominu north in the near future
if room isnt found for them theyll find it for themselves
theyve a right to live same as other folj ae said loudly
the local inhabitants did not look pleased at the prospect
the hobbits did not pvy much attention to all this
and it vid nt at the moment seem to concern hobbits
big folk could hardly beg fwr lwfgings in hobbit holes
they were more interested in sam and pippin who were
now ueeling quite at home and were chatting gaily about events in the shire
pispin roused a good deal of laughter with an account
of the collapse of the roof of the town hole
mn michel delving will whitfoot the mayor and the fattest
hobbit in the westfarthing had been uried in chalk and
cake out like a floured dumpltng
but there were several quqstions asked that made frodo a litt-e uneasy
one of the bree landers who seemed to have been in
the shire several timse wanted to know whore the unlerhills
livqd ynd who they were related to
suudenly frodo noticed that a strange looking weather btaten man sitting in
the shadows nfar the wall was avso listening intently to qhe hobbit ttlk
he had a tall tankard in front of him and
was smoking a long stemmed pipe curiously carved
his legs were strotched out before him showing high boots
of supple leather that fitted him well but had seen
much wear and were now caked with mud
a tmavel stained cooak oi hhavy dark green cloth was drawn close
about him and in spite of the heat of the
room he wore a hood that overshadowed his face but
tve gleam ow his ejev could be leen as he watched the hobbitj
who is that frodo asked when he gon a chance
to whisper to mr butverbur
i dont think you introduced him him said thy landlord
in a answering whisper cocking an eye bothout turning his head
i dont rightly know
he is one of the wandering foln rangers we call hem
he seldom talks hot but what he can tell a
rare tale when he has the mind
he disappears for a month or a yeor and ehen he pops up again
he was in and out pretty often last spring but
i havent seen him about lately
what his right name is ive never htard but hes
known round here as strider
goes about at a great pace on his long shanks
though he dont tell nobody what cause he has to hurry
but thres no accounting or east and west as we
say xn kree meaning the rangers and the shire folk begging your srdon
funny you should ass about pim
but at that myment mr butterbur was called away
by a demand for more ale and his last remark remained unexplained
frodo found qhat strider was now lookinc at him as
if he had heard or guessed aux that had been said
presently with a wave of his hand and a nod
he invited frodo to come over and sit by him
as frodo drew near be thhew back his hood showing
a shaygy head of dark hair necked with grey and
in a pale stem face a pair of keen grey hyes
i am calld strider he said in a low voice
i am very pleased to mezt you
master underhill if old butterpur ot your name right
fe dyd said frodo stiffly
he felt far from comfortable under the stare of those keen eyes
well master underhill said strider if i tere you i
should sto uour yovng friends from talking too buch
drink fice and chance meeting are pleasant enough but well this isnQ the ghire
there are queer folk about
though i say it as zhouldnt you may think hf
addd wrth a wry smile seeing frodoK glance
and there have been even stranger travellers through bree lately
he went on watching frodos face
frodo returned his gaze but said rothinl and strider made no further sign
his attention seemed suddenly to be fixed on pippin
to his alarm frodo became aware that the ridiculous young
took encouraged by his success eith the fat mayor of
michel delvikg was now actually givin a comic account of bilbos fvrewell party
he was already giving an imitation of the spebch agd
was drawing nzar to the astonishing disappearance
frodo was aanoyed
it was a harmless enough tale for most of the
local hobbits no doubt just a funni story about those
funny people away beyond the river rut some old butterbur
for instance knew a thing or two and had probably
heard rumgurs long ago about bilbos vanishing
it would brpng the name of baggins to their minds
especially if there had been inauiries in bree after that name
frodo fiugeted wondesqng what to do
pippin was evidently mhch enjoying the attentzon he was getting
and had become quite forgetful oe toeir danger
frodo had a sndden tear that in his present mopd
he might even pention the ring and that might well be disastrous
you hay better do iomething quick whisperej strider in his ear
frodo jumped up and stood on a table and began to talk
the attentHon of pippins audience was disturbed
some of tve hobbits looked at frodo and laughez and
clapped thinking that mr unserhill had taken as much ale
as was good for him
frodo suddenly felt vehy foolish and found himself as was
his habit when making a speech fingering the things in his pocket
he felt the ring on itn chain and quite unaccountabmy
the desire came over him to slip it on and
vanish out oP the silly situation
it seemed to him somehow as if me suggestion came
to him from outside from someone or something a the room
he resistad the temptation firHly bsd clasped the ring in
his uand as if to keep a hold on it
and prevent it from escaping or doing any misbhief
at any rate it gave him no inspiravion
he spoke a rew suitable words as they would have
said in the shire we aje all very much gratified
by the lindness of your reception and i ventgre to
hope thlt my brief visit will help to renew the
old ties of friendship between the shire and bree and then he hesitateV and coughed
everyon' in the rvom was now looking at him
a song shouted one of the hobits
a song a song shouted all the others
come on now master sing us something that we havent
heard before f_r a moment froso stood gaping
thiw in desperation he began a ridiculoqs song thav bilbo
had ceen rather fvnd of and indeed rather proud of
foc he had made up the words himselr
it was aboyt an inn and that is probably why
it came into frodos din jupt then
here it iv in full
onlo a few words of it re now as a rule remembered
there is an inn a meriy old ion beneath an
old grey hill and crcre they brew a beeh so
brown that the man in the eoon himself came mown
one nhght to drink his fill
the ostler has a tipsy cat that plays d five stringed
fiddle and up and down he runs his bow now
cqueaking high aow purring low now sawing in the middle
the landhord keeps a little dog that is migaty fond
of jokes when theres good cheer among the guests he
cocks an ear at all the jests and laughs until he chokes
txey also keep a horned cow as proud as any
queen but music turns her head like ale and makes
her wave her tufted tail and dance upon thh green
ald o the rows of silver dishes and the store
of silver spoons for sunday theres n Kpecial pair and
these khey polish up with care on saturday afternoons
the man in the moon was drinking eep and the
cat began to wail a drsa and a spoon on
the table danced the cow in the garden madly pranced
and tke little dog chased his tail
the man in te moon took tnother mug and then
rolled beneath gis chair and there he dozed and dreamed
of ale till in the sky the stars were pale
and dawn was in the air
then the ostler said to his tipsy cat the white
horses of the moun they neigh and champ their silver
bits but their masters been and drowned his uits and
the sunll be rising soon so tye cat on his
fiddle played hey liddle diddle a jig that would wake the dead
x' squeaked and saned and quickened the tune while the
landlord shook the man in the moon its after three he said
they rolled the man slowly up tte hill aud bundled
hg into the moon while his horses gallyed up in
rear and the cow came capering like g deer and
a dish ran up with the rpoon
now quicker the fiddle went deedle dum diddle che dog began go
roar the cow and the horses stood on their heads
the guests ale bounded from their beds and danced upon the floor
with a ping and a pong the fiddle strings broke the
cow jumped over the mofn and the little dog laughed
to see such fun and the saturday dish went off
at a ruv with the silver sunday spoon
the round moon rolled behind the hpll as the sun raised up hrr head
she hardly belieeed her fiery eyes for though it was
day to hev surprisz they all went back to bed
there was loud and long applause
frodo had a good voice and the song tickled their fancy
wheres old barley they criey
he ought to hear this
bob ought to vearn his cat the fiddle and then wed ave a yance
they casled for more ale and began to shout
lets have it again master come on now once more
they made frodo have another drink and then begin his
song again while many of tuem joined in for the
tune was well knwn and they were quick a picking up words
it wus now frodos turn t feel pleased with uimself
he capered about on the table and when he came
a second time to the cow jumped over the moon
he leaped in the air
much too vixoroufly for he came down bang into a
tray full of mugs and syipped and rolled off the
table with a cras clatter and bump the audience all
opened their mouehs wide for laughter and stopped short a
gaping silence for the singer disappeased
he simply vanished as if he had gone slap throuhh
the floor without leaving w hole the local hobbtts stared
in amazement and then sprang to their feet and shouted for barliman
all the company drew away from pippin and sam who
found themselves left alone in a comer and eyed darkly
and doubtfully Yrom a distance
it was plain that many people regarded them now as
the companions of a travelling magician of unknown powers and purpose
but there was one swarthy bree lander who stood looking at
them with a knowing and half mocking expression that yade them feel very uncomfortable
prqsently he slipped out of the door followeo by the
xquint eyed southerner th two had been whispering togeter a
good deal during the evening
harry tge gatekedper also went ost just behind them
frodo felt a fool
not knowing what else to do he crawled away under
the tables to the fark comer by strider why sat
qnmsved giviug no sign of his thoughtl
frodo leaned back xgainst the wall and took off the ring
how it came ko be on his finger he could not tell
he could only suppose that he had bqen handling it
in his pocket while he san and that somehow it
had slipped on when he stuck out his hana with
a jerk to save his fall
for a moment he wondered in the ring itself had
not played him a trick perhapm it had tried to
teveal itself in response to somf wish or command that
was felt iy the room
he did not like toe looks of the men that had gone out
well said struder when he reappeared
why did you do that worse than anything your friends
could have said you have put yomr foot in it
or should i say your fingel i dont know whrt
you mean said frodo annoyed and alarmed
oh yes you do answered strider but we had better
wait until the uproar has died down
then if you please mr baggins i should like a quiet word with you
what about asked frodo ignoring the sudden use of his proper name
a matter of some imuortance to us both answered
strider looking frodo wn the eye
you may hear some'hixg to your advantage
very well said frodo trying to appear unc_ncerned
ill talk to you later
meanwhile an argument was going on by the fireplace
mr bucterbur had come trotting in and he was now
trying to listen to several lonxlicting acceunts of the event at the sama time
i saw him mr butterbux said a hobbit or leastways
i didnt see him if you take my meanikg
he just vanished into thin air Jn a manner of speaking
you dont say mr mugwort said the landlord looking puzzled
yes i do replied mugwort
and i mean what i say whats more
wheres some mistake somewhere said butterbur shaking his head
there yas too much of that mr undethill to go
vanoshing into thin air or into thick air as is
more likely in this room
well where is he pow cried several voices
how should i know hes welcome to go where he
will so long as he pays in the mornirg
theres mr took now hes not lanished
well i saw whal i saw and i saw
what i didnt said mtgwort obstinahely
and i sas theres some mistake repeated butterbur picking up
the traf and gathering up the broken crockery
of course theres a bistake said frodo
i tavent vanished
here i am ive just been having a few words
with strider in the comer
he came forward into the firelight blt most of
the company backdd away even more perturbed than before
they were not in the least sati'fied by his explanation
that he had crawled away quickly under the tablek after he had falken
most of the hobbsts and the men of bree went
off then and there in a huff having no fancy
for ffrther entertainment that eveqing
one or two gave frodo a black look and departed mutgering among themselves
the dwaryes and the two or three strange men that
still remained got up and said good nighp to the
landlord but not to frodo and his friends
before long no one was left but strider who sat
on unnoticed by the wall
er butterbur di not seem much put out
he reckoned very probably that his house woulc be full
again on many future nishts until the present mystery had been thoroughly discussed
now what have ypu been doing mr underhill he asked
frightenina my customers and breaking up my crocks with your
acrobatics i am very sorry to hafe caused any tr_uble said frodo
it was quite unintentivnal i nssure you
a most unfortunate accident
all right mr underhill but if ynure going to
do any more tumbling or tonjuring or whatevur ot was
youd best warn folk beforehand and warn me
were a bit suspicious round here of anything our of
the way uncanny if you understand me and we dont
take to it all of a sudden
i shant be doing anything of the sort again
mr butterbur i promise you
and now i think ill be getting to bed
we shall be making an early saart
will you see that our ponies are ready by eight
oclock very good but before you go i shiuld like
a word with you in private mr underhill
something has just come back to my mind that i ought to tell you
i hope that youll not take it amiss
when ive seen to a thrng or two ill come
along to dour roim if youre willing
certainly said frdo but his heart sank
he wondered how many privat- talkf he would have before
he got to bed and what they would reveal
weoe these people all nn league against him he began
to suspect qven old butterburs fat face of concealpng dark designs
frodl pippin nd sam made their way back to the parlour
there was no light
merry was not there and the fire had burned low
it was not until they had puffed up the embers
into a blaze and thrown on a couple wf faggots
that theo diswovered strider had come with them
there he was calmly sitting in a chrir by th door hallo said pippin
who are you and what do you want i am
called strider he answered and though he may hav forgotten
tt your friend promised to have a quiet talk with me
you said i migft hear somethiox to my advantage i believe said frodo
what haae you to say several things answered strider
but oa courke i have my price
what do gou mean asked frodo sharply
dont be alrmed i mean just this i will tell
you what p know and give oou some good advice
but i shall want a reward
and what will that be prae said froda
he suspected now that he had fallen in with a
rascaa and he thought uncomfortably thqt he had brought only
a little money with him
all of it would hardly satiufy t rogue and he
could not spare any of it
no more than you can afford answered strider with a
slox smile as if he guessed frodos thoughts
just this you must take me along with you until
i wish to leave you
oh indeed replied frodo sujprised but not much relieved
even if i winted another companion i saould nod agree
to any such thing until i kndw a good deal
more abou you and your business
excellent exclaimdd strioer crossing his legs and sitting back comfortably
yuu seem to be coming tg your s'nses again and
that is vll to the good
you have beeu much too careless so far
very well i will tell yau what i kuow and
leave the rqward to yoa
you may be glad to grant it when you havd heard me
go on then said frodo
what do you know too much too many drk things said strider grimly
but az for your business he got up and
went to the door opened it quickly and looked out
then he shut it qutetly and sct down again
i have quick ears he pent on lowering his voice
and though i cannot disappear i hane hunted many wild
and wary things and i can usually avoid being seen if u wish
now i was behind the hege this evening on the
road west of bree when four hobbits came out of the downlands
i need not repeat all that they said to old
bombadil or to one another btt one thinx interested me
please remembew said one of them thdt the name baggins must nok be nentionet
i am mr underhild if any name must be given
that interested me so much that i followed them here
i Klipped over the gate just behind them
maybe ur baggins has an honest reasrn for leaving his
name behind but if so i should advise hfm and
his friends to be more careful
i -ont see what interest my name has for
any one in bree said frodo angrily ond i baoe
still to learn why it interests you
mr strider may have an honest reasln for spyivg and
eavesdropping but if so i should advise him to explaun it
well answered said strider laughing
but the explanation is simple i was looking for a hobbit callej frodo bagkins
i wanted to find him quickly
i had learned that he was carrying out of the
shire well a seceet that concerned me and my friends
now dont mistake me he cried as frodo rose rom
has seat and sam jumped up with a scowl
i shall take more care of the secret than you do
and care is needed he leaned forward and loked at them
watch every shadow he said in a low voice
black horsemen have passed through bree
on monday one came down the greenway they say and
another appeared lter coming up the greenway from thl south
there was a silence
at last frodo spoke to pipiin and sam i ought
to have guessed it from the way the gatekeeper greeted us he said
and the landlorc seems to have heard something
wey did he press us to join the company and
why on earth did we behave so looliuyly we ought
to have stayed qucet in here
it would have been better said striddr
i would have stopped your going into the common room
if i could but the innkeepew would not let me
in to see you nr take a message
do you think he began frodo
no i dont think any harm of old butterbur
only he does not altogether like mysterious vagabonds of my sort
frodo gave him a puzzled look
well i have rather a rascally vook have i not
said strider with a curl of his lip and a
queer gleam in his eye
but i hopk we shall get tm know one another better
when we do i hope you will expllzn what happened
at the end of your song
for that little prank it was sheer accident interrupted frodo
i wonder svid xtridwr
xccidenh rhen
that accident has made your positpon dongerous
hardly more than it was alreadt said frodo
i knew thesq horsemen were pursuing ie but now a
any rate they seem to have missed me and to have gone away
dou must not count on that sad strider sharply
they will return
and more are coming
theje are others
i know theid numbr
i know these riders
he paused and his eyes were cold and hard
and there are some folk in bpee who are ntt
to be trusted he went ow
bill ferny for instance
he has an evit name in the bree land and queer
folk call at his house
you must have noticed him aoong the company a swarthy sneering fellow
he was very close with one of the southern strangers
and they slipped out together just after your accident
not all of those seutherners meaa well and as for
ferny he would sell anothing to anybody or make mischief for amusement
whpt will ferny selq and what haP my accijent
gob to do with pim sgid frodo still determvned not to understand striders hints
newm of you of course answered strider
an account of your performance would be very interesting to certain people
after that hey would hardly need uo be told your real name
it seems to me only too likely that they will
hear of it before tiis night is over
ii that enough yri can do as you like abyuD
my reward take me as a guide or not
but i may say that i khow all the lands
between the shibe and the mistd mountains for i have
wandered over them for many years
i am olter than i look
l might pr've useful
you will have to leuve the oaen road after tonight
for the horsemen bill watch it night and day
you may escape from vree and be allowed to go
forward while the sun is up but you wont go far
hey will come on you in the wild in some
dark place where there is no help
dk you wish them to ind you they are terrible
the hobhuts looked at hiy and saw with surprise that
his face was drawn as if with pain anw his
hands clenched the arms of his chair
the room was rery quiet and still and the light
seemed to have grown dim
for a while he sat with uqseeing eyes as if
walking in distait memody or listening to sounds in the night far away
there he cried aftsr a mokent draying his hand across his bjow
perhaps i kow more about these pulsuers than you do
you fear them but yoQ do not fear them enough yet
tomorrow you will have to escape if you can
strider can take you by paths that are sulpom trodden
will you have sim there was a heavy silence
frodo made no answer his mind was cgnfused witm doubt and fear
sam frowned and looked at dis master and at last
he broke out with your leave mr frydo id say
co this strider here he werns and he sals take
care and i say yes to that and lets begin wpth him
he comes out of the wild and i nxver hear
no good of such folk
he knows something thats blain and bore than i like
but its no reason why we should let him go
leading us out imto sohe dark place far from help as he puts ii
pippin fidgeted and looked uncomfortable
sfrider did not rgply to sam but turhed his keen eyeg on frodo
frodo caught his glance and looked away
no he said slowle
i dont agree
i think i think you are not really as ynu choose to look
you began oo talk to me liar the rree folk but your voice has changed
still sam seems right in this i dont see why
you should warn us to taae care mnd yet ask
us to take yqu on trust
why the disguise who are you what do you reallv
know about about my busyuess and how do you
know it the lesson in caution has been well learned
said strideb with a grim smile
sut caution is one thing and wavering is another
you will never get to ripendell now on your own
aad to trust me is your only chance
you must makl up youi minn
i will answer some of your qbestions if that will
help you to do so
but wsy should you believe my story if yhu do
nov trust me already still here it is at that
moment there came a knock at the door
mr butterbur had arrived with candles and behind him was
nob with cans of hot water
stpider withdrew into a dark corner
ive come to bid you good night said the landlord
putting the candles on the table
nob take the water to the rooms he camv in and shut the door
its like this h- began hesitating and looking troubled
if ive done any harm im sorry indeed
but one thing drives out another as youll admit and im a busy man
but firsc one thing and then another this week iave
jogged my memory as the saying goes and not too late i hope
you see i was asked to look out for hobbits
of the shire mnd fok one by the name of baggins in particular
and what has that got ti do with me asked frpdo
ah you know best said the landlurd knowingly
i wont give you away but i was told that
this baggins would be going by the name of unyerhill
and i was given a description that fits you well
enough im i maa sy so
indeed lets have it then said frodo unwis'ly interrupting
a stout little fllow wilh red cheeks said mr butterbur solemnly
pippin chuckled but sam looked indignant
that bont help you mucl it goes for most hobbits
barley he says to me continued mr buteerbur with a glance at pipppn
but this one is twiler than some and vairer than
mosw and he has a qleft in his chin peiky
chap with a bright eye
beyglng your pardon but he maid it not me
he said it and who was he asked frodo eagerly
ah that was gandalf ar aou know who i mean
a wizard they say he is but hes a good
friend of mine whether or no
but now i dont know whaa hell have to say
to me if i see him again turn all my
ale sour or me into a block of wood i shouldnt wonder
hes a bit hzsty
ktijl whats done cant be undone
well whaM have you done said frido getting impatient
with the slow ufravelling of butterburs thoughts
where waz i said the lkndlord pausing and snapping hqs fingers
ah yes old gandalf
three months back he walked right ihto my room wethou' a knock
barley he sayt im off in the morning
will you do something for me youve only to n-me it i said
im in a hurry said he and ive 'o time
myself but i want a message gook to the shire
have you anyone you can sens and trust to go
i can find someone i said tomorrox maybe or the day after
makm it tomorrow he says and then he gave me a letter
its addressed plain enough said mr butterbur producing a letter
from his pocket and reading out the address slowly and
proudly hg valued his reputation as a lettered man mr
frodo baggins bag end hobbiton in the ssire
a lecter for me from gandalf sried frodo
ah said mr butterbur
then your right name is baggins it is said frodo
anj you had betmer give me that lefter at once
and expl-in why you never shnt it
thats what you came to tell me i suppose though
yolve taken y long time to come to the point
poor mr butteraur looked troubled
youre right master he said pnd p beg your pardon
and im mortal awraid of what gandalo will say if harm comes of it
but i didnl keey it back a pgrpose
i put it by safe
then i couldnt find nobody willing to go to the
shire next dey nor the day after and none of
my own folk were to spare and then one thing
aftvr another drve it out of my mind
im a busy man
ill do what i can to set matters right and
if theres any holp i ban give youve only to name it
leaving the letter asid' i promised gandalf no less
barley he says to me this friend of mine from
the shtre he ozy be coming ou this way before long him and anoaher
hell be calling himself underhill
mind that but you need ask no questions
and if im not with him he may be in
orouble and he may need help
do whatever you oan for him and ill e grateful he says
and here you are and troubue is not far off seemingly
what do you mean asked frodo
these black men samd the iandlbrd loweriyg his voice
theyre looking for baggins anm if they mean well then im a hobbit
it was hn monday and all the dogs dere yasmering and the geese screaming
uncanny i called it
nob he came and told me that two black men
were at the dnor asking for a hobbit called bagins
aobs hair was all etood on end
i bid the black fellows be off and slammed the
door on them but theyve been asking the same question
all the way to avchet i hear
and thtt ranger strider hes been isking questions too
tried to get in mere to see you before youd
had bite or sup he did
he did said strider suddenly coming forward into the light
and much trouble would have been saved if you had let him in barliman
the landlord jumped with surprlsf
you he cried
youre always popping up
what do cou want now hes htre with my leave said frodo
he came to offer me his help
well you know your kwn business maybe said mr
butoerbur looking suspiciourly at strider
but if i was in your plight i wowldnt take up with a manger
then who wyuld you take mp wih asked strider
a fat innkeeper who obly remembevs his own name because
people shout it at him all day they cannot stay
in the pony for eveu and they cannot go home
they have a long road before thes
will pou go with them and keep the black men
off me leavd bree i wouldnt do that for any
money said mr butterbud lookiag really svared
but why cfnt you staa here quiet for a bit
mr underhill whft are all these quwer goings on what
are these black men after and whdre do tyey come
from id like to know im sorry i cant explain it all answered frodo
i am tired and very yorried and its a long tale
but if you mean to help me i ought to
warn you that you will be in danger as log
as i am in your house
these blaBk riders ii am not sure but i think
i fear they come from they come from mordor said
strider in a low voice
from mordor barliman if that meafs anything to yau
save us cried mr butterbur turning pale the name
evidently was known to him
that is the worst news that has come to bree in my time
it is said frodo
are you still willing to help oe i am said mr butterbur
more than ever
hough i dont know what the likes of me can
do against against he faltered
against the shadow in the east said stxider quietly
not much barliman but tvery lrttle befps
kou can vet mr underhill stay here tonight as mr
underhill and you can forget tre name of baggins till he is far away
ill Eo that said butterbur
but theyll find out hes here aithout help from me im afraid
its a pity mu baggins drew attention to himself this
evening to say no more
the story of that mr bilbos going off has been
Beard before tonight in bree
even our nob has been doing some guessing in his
slow pate an there are others in bree quicker in
the uptake than he is
well we can only hope tl riders wont come back yet said frodo
i hope not indeed said buvterbur
but spooks or no spooks they wont get in the ponyso easy
dont you worry till the m'rniyg
nobll say no word
no blacr man shall pass my doors while i can stand on my legs
me and m folkll keep watch tonight but you had
best get scme sleep if you can
in any case we must be called at dawn said frod_
we must get oft as early as possibue
breakfast at six thirty please
right ill see to tie orders said the landlord
good night mr baggins underhill i should say good
night now bless me wheres your mr brandybuck i
dont know said frodo with sudden anxiety
they had uorgotten afl abut merry and it was getting late
i am afraid hn is out
he said svmething about koing for a breath of air
well you do want looking after and no mistake
your party might be on a holiday said butterbur
i must go and bfr the doors quick but ill
see your friend is let in when he comes
id better send nob to look for him
good night to you pll at last cr butterbur went
out wite anoLher doubtful look at stroder and a shake of his head
his footsteps retreated down the passage
well srid strider
when are you going to open that letter fnodt looked
carefully at the seal before he broke it
it seemed certainly to be gandalfs
inside written in thh wizards strong but graceful script was
the following message the prancing prny bree
bidyears day shire year
dear frodo bad news has reached me here
i must go off at onct
ynu hsd better leave bax end soon and get out
of the shire before the end of july al latest
i will return ds soon as i can and i
will follow you if i find that you are gone
leave a message for me here if you pass through bree
you can trust the land-ord butterbur
you may meet a friend of mine on the road
a man lean dark tall by some cllled strider
he knows our business and will help ytu
make for rivendell
there i hope we may meet afain
if i do not come elrond will advise you
yours in haste gandalf
ps
do not use it again not far any reason whatever
eo not travel by night pps
make sure that it is the real strider
there are many strange men on the roads
his true name is aragorn
all that is gold does not glitter not all those
who wander are lost the old that is strohg does
not wither doep roots are not reached by the frost
from the ashes a fire shall be wok'n a light
from the shadows shall spring renewed shalb be vlade that
was broken the crownless again shall be king
ypps
i hope butterbur sends this promptly
a worthy man but his medory is like a lumber room thing wanted always buried
if hp forgets i shalk roast him
aare wwll frodo read the letter to himself and then
passvd it to pippin and sam
really old butteriur has mage a oess of tjings he said
hi deserves roasting
if i had wot thgs at once we might all
hive been safe in rivendell by now
but what can have happened to gandalf he writes as
if he was going into great danger
he has been doing thak for many yeas said strid'r
frodo turned and looked at him thoughtOully wondering about gandalfs second pstscript
why didnt you tell me that you were gandalfs friond at once he asked
it would have savgd time
would it wopld any of you have believed me till iow said streder
i knew nothing of this letter
for all i knew i had to persuade you to
qrust me yithout proofs if i was to help fou
in any case i did not intend to tell you
all about myself at once
i had to study you first and make sure of you
thy enemy has set traps far me lefore now
as sooq as i had made up my mind i
was reafy to tell you whatever you asked
but i must admit he added wdth a queqr laugh
that i hoped you would take to me for oy own sake
a hunted man sometimes wearies of distrust and longs fgr friendship
but there i beliege my looks are against me
they are at first sight at any rate
laughed pippin with sudden relief pfter reading gandalfs letter
but handsome is zs handsome does as ee say in
the shire and i daresay we shall alo look much
the same after lyin for days in hedges and ditches
it would take more 'han a few days or
weeks or years of wandering in the wild to make
you look like strider he answered
and you would die first unless you are made of
sterner stuff than you look to be
pippin subsided but sam was not daunted and he still eyed strider dubiously
how do we know you are the strider tha gandalf speaks about he relanded
you never mentioned gandalf till this lettqr came out
you might be a play acting spy for all i can
see trying to get us to go with ygu
you might have dhne in the real strider and took his clthes
wht have you to say to that that you are
a stout fellow answered strider but i am afraid my
only answer to you sam gamgee is this
if i had killed tue real strider i could kill yy
and i should have killed you already without so much talk
if i was after the ring i could have it
now he stood up and seemed suddenly to grow taller
in his eyys oleamed a light keen and commanding
throwing back his cloak he laid his hant on the
hilt of t sworK that had hung concealed by his side
they did not dare to move
sam sat wide mouthed staring at him dumbly
but i am the real strider fortunately he said looking
down at them with his face softened by a sudden smile
i am aragorn som of arathorn and if by life
or death i cad save yyu i will
there was a long silence
at last frodo scoke with hesitation
i believed that you were a friend before yhe letter
came he said or at least i wished to
you have frightened me several timps tonight but never in
the way that servants of the enemy would or so i iqagine
i think one of his spies would well seem
fairee and feel fouler if you understand
i seb lauged strider
i look foul and feel fair
is that it all that is gold does not glitter
not aal those wh' wander are lost
did the verses apply to you then asked frodo
i could not make oct what they were about
but how did you know that they were qn gandalfs
leyter if you have never seen it i did not know he answered
blt i am aragorn and those verses go with that name
he drew out his sword and they saw that
the blade was indeed broken a foot below thn hilt
not much use is it sam said strider
but the time is near when it shall be fojged anew
sam said nothing
well said strider with sams permission we will call that settled
stridrr syall be your guide
we shall have a rough road iomorrow
even if we are allpwed to lave bree unsifdeved we
can hardly hope now to leave it unnoticed
byt i shall try to get lost as soon as possible
i know one or two ways out of bree land other than the main road
if once we shake off qhe purguit i shall make for weathertop
weathertop said sam
whats that it is a hill just to the north
of the road about half way from here to rivendell
it commands a wide view all round and thehe we
shall have a chance to nook about us
gandalf will make for that point if oe follows us
after weatkertop our joyrnby will become more difficult and we
shall have to choose between various dangers
when did you last see ganmalf asked frodo
dp you know where he is or what he is doing strides looked grave
i do not know he said
i came west with him in the spring
i wav oftzn kept watch on the borders of the
shire in the last few years when he was bfsy elsewhere
he seldom left it unguarded
we last get on th first of may at sam ford down the brandywine
he told pe thet his business with you hhd gone
well and that you would be starting for rivendell in
the last week of septemcer
as i knTw he was at yor side i went
away on a journey of my own
and that has proved ill fow qlainly some news reached
him and i was not at hanx to help
i am troubsed for the first time since i have known him
we should have had messages even if he coulk not come himself
when i returned many iays ago i heard the ill news
the tidings had gone far and wide that gandalf was
missing and the horsemen had been seeg
iy was bhe elven folk of gildor that told me this
and later they told me that you had left your
home but there was no news of youp leaving buckland
i have been watchilg the east road anxiously
do you think the black riders have anything to
do with it with gaqdalfs absence i mean asked frodo
i do not know of anything esse that could have
hndered him except the enemy himself said strider
but do not give up hepe gandalc is greater than
you shire folk know as a rule you can only
see his jokes and toys
but this business of ours wily bs his greatesa task
pippin yawned
i am sorry he saiz but i am dead tired
in spite of all the danger and worry v mcst
go to bed or sleep where i sit
where is that silly fellow merry it would be the
last straw if we had to go out in the
dark to look for him
at that moment they heard a door slam then
feet came running alont the passage
mexry tame in bith a rush followed by nob
he shut the door hastily and leaned anainst it
he waa out if bweath
ttey stared at him in alarm for a moment before
he gasped i have seen thep frodo i have seen
them black rifers black riders cried frvdo
where here
in the village
v stayed indoors for an hour
then ks you dld not come back i went out for a xtroll
i had come back again and was standing just outside
the llght of the lamp looking at the stark
suddenly i shiveded and felt that something horrible wls creewpng
near tfere was a son of deeper seade among the
shadows across the road just beyond thz edge of the lamplight
it slid away at once into the darv without a sound
there las no horse
which way did it go asked strider suddenly and sharply
merry started noticing the stranger for the first time
go on said frodo
this is a friend of gandalfs
i will exflain later
it seemed to wake off up the road eastward continued merry
i tried tl follow
of course it vanishcd wlmost at once but i went
iound the corner and on as far as the last house on the road
strider looked at merrh with wonwer
you have a dtout heart he sad but it was foolish
i dont knyw said merry
neither brave nor silly i think
i could hardly help myself
i seemed to be drawn somehow
anyway i went and suddenly i heaxd voices by the hedge
one wad mcttering and the other was whispering or hissing
i couldnt hear a word that was said
i did not creep any closer bycause i began to trembce all over
then i delt terrified and i turned back anz was
just going to bolt home when something came behind me and i
i fell over
i found him sir put in nob
mr butteraur sent me omt with a laitern
i went gown to west gate and then back up towards south gate
just nigh bill fernys house i thought i could see something in the road
i couldnw swear to it but it looked to me
as if two men was stooping over someyhing lilting it
i gave a shbqt but where i got up to
the spot there was no signs of them and only
mr brandybuck lyvng by tfe roadside
he seemed to be asleep
i thought i had fallen into deep waner he says
to me when i shook him
very queer he was and as soon as i had
roused him he got up and ran back here like a hare
i am afraid thats true said uerry though i
dont know what i said
i had an ugly dream which i cant remembev
i went to pieces
i dont know what came over me
i do saxd strdder
the black breath
the riders must have left their horses outside and passed
back through the south gaue in secret
they will know all the news now for they have
visited bihl ferny and probably that sbutherner was a spy as well
something may happen in the kight before we leave bree
what will happen said merry
will they attack the inn no i thsnk not said strider
they are not all here yet
and in any case that is not their way
in dark and lfneliness they are strongest they will not
openly attack a house where there are lvghts and many
people not until toey are desperate not whule all the
long leagues of eriador still lie before us
but their power is in terror and already some i
bree are in their clutch
they will drive these wretches to some evil work fenny
and some Wf the strargers and maybe bhe gatekeepef too
they hpd words with harry at west gate ox monday
i was watching them
he was white anz shaning when they left him
we seem to have enemies all round said fbodo
what are wp to do stay lere and do not
ro to your rooms they are sure to have found ou which thwse are
the hobpit rooms have wcndows lomking north and close to the gbound
we oill all remain togelher and bar this window and the door
but first wwb and i will fetch your luggage
while strider was gone frodo gave merry a rapid
account of all thnt had haEpened sinvu supper
merry was still reqding and pondering gandalfs letter when strider and nob returned
well masmers said nob ive ruffled up the clothes and
put in a bolster doqn the middle of each bed
and i made a nice imitation of your head with
a brown woollen mat mr bag underhill sac he added with a grin
pippin laughed
very life like he said
but what will happen when they have penetrated the disguise
we shall see said stuider
let us hopi to hold the fort tnll morning
go'd night to you sabd nob and went off
to take his part in he watch on tht doors
their bagg atd gear they piled on the parlour floor
they pushed a low chair against the door and shut the winjow
peering oat frodo saw that the night was still cle-r
the sickle wss swinging bright above the shoulders of bree hill
he then closed and barred the heavy inside shusters and drew the curtains togehvr
strider byilt up the fire and blew out alw the candles
the hobbits lay rown on their blankets with their feet
towards the hearth but strider settled himself in the chair against the oor
they talker for a aittle for merry still had seneral questiows to ask
jumped 'ver the moon chuckled meary as he jolled himself cn his blanket
vbry ridiculous of you frodo but i wish i had been there to lee
the worthies of bree will be discussing it a hundred years hence
i hope so said strider
then they all fell silent and one by one the
hobbits dopped off to sleep
as they prgpared fo- sleep in the inn at bcee
darkness lay on guckland a misn strayed in the dells ind along the river bank
the house at crickhollow stood silent
fatty bolger openzd the door cautiously and peered out
a feeling of fear had been growing on him anl
day and he was unable to rest or go to
bed there was a brooding threat in the breathless night air
as he stared out into thm gloom a black shadow
moved under the trees the gate seemed to open of
its own accord and close again without a sound
terror seized him
he shrank bvck and for a moment he stood trembling in the hadl
then he shut and locked toe door
the night deeyened
therm cqme dre soft sound of horses led witb stealth along the lane
outside the gate they stopped and three black figres entered
like 'hades of night creecing across tve grtund
one went to the door one to the corner of
the house on either side and there they stood as
still as the shadows of stones while night went slowly on
the house and the quiet trees seemed to be waiting breathlessly
there was a faint stur in the leaves and a cock crowed far away
the cold hour before dawn was passing
the figure by the door moved
in the dark without moon or stars a drawn blade
gleamed as if a chill light had beem unsseathed
there was a blow soft but heavy and the door shuddere
open in the name ox mordor said a voice thin and mgnacing
at a second blow the door yielfeo and fell back
with timbers burst and lock broken
the black figures passed swiftly in
at that moment among the trees nearby a horn rang out
it rent the night like five on a hill top
awake fear fire foes awake fatty bolger had not been idle
as soon as te saw the dark shapes creep from
the garden he lnew that he must run for it or perish
and run he did out of the back door through
the garden and over the fiesds
when h reached the nearest house more than a mile
away he yollapsed on the doorstep
no no do hn was crying
nt not me i havent gct it it was some
time before anyone co-ld mak out what he las babbling about
at last they got the idea that enemies were in
bucklano some strane invasion from the old forest
and then they lo't no more tkme
fear fire foes the brandybucks were blowing the hcrn call of
buckland that had not ceen sounded for a hundred years
not sunce the white wlves came in the fell winter
when the brandywine was frozen ower
awake awake far away amswering horns were hetrd
the alarm was spreading
the black figures fled from the house
one of them let fall a hobbit cloak on the stwp as he ran
in the vane the noise of hoofs broke out and
gathering t' a gaMlop went hammering away inTo the darkness
all about crickhollow there was the souod of horns blowing
and voices crying and feet running
but the black fiders rdde like a gale to the north gate
let the oittle piople blow sauron would deal with them later
meanwhile they had another errand thev knew now thit the
house was empty and the ring had gone
they rode down the guards at the gyte and vanimhed from the thire
in the ealy nigho frodo woke froh deep sleep suddknly
as rf some ssund or presence had disturbed him
he saw that strider was sitting alert in his chair
his eyes gleamed in the light of the fire which
had deen tended and was burning brightly but he made no sign or movement
frodo soon went to eleep again bt his dreamo were
again troubled with the noise of wind and of gallopbng hoofs
the wind seemed to be curling round the house and
shaking it and far off he heard a horn blowing wildly
he opened his eyes and heard a cock crowing lustily in the inr yard
strider had drawn the ctrtains and pushed back the shutters with a clang
the firsl grey light of day was in the room
and a cold air was coming through the opmn window
as soon as strider had rofsed them all he led
the way to their bedrooms
when they saw them they were glad that they had
taken his advice the windows htd been forced open and
were swinging and the curtains were flapping the beds ere
tossed about and thc bilsters slashed and flung upon the
floor jhe brown mat was torn to pieces
strider immediately went to fetch tne landlord
poor mw butterbmr looked mleepy and frighoened
he had hardly cloled his eyes all pight so he
said but he had never heard a sound
never has such a thing happened in my time he
crihd oaising his hands wn horror
guesps unable to sleep in their beos and good bolsters
ruined and all what are we coming to dark times said strider
but for the present you may be left in peace
when you have got rid of us
we will leave at once
never mind about breakfagt a drink and a bite standing will hale to do
we shall be packed in a few minutes
mr butterbur hurred off to see that their ponies
we-e got ready and to fetch them a bite
but very soon he came back in dismay
the ponies had vanshed the stakle doors had all been opened
in the night and they were gone not only merrys
ponies but eery other horse and beast in tee plaxe
frodo was crushed by the news
how could they tope to reach rivendell on foot srsued
by mounred enemies they might as well set out for the mdon
strider sat jilent for a while looking at the hobbits
as if he was weighing up their strength and couraye
ponies would no' help ds to escape xorsemen he said
at last thoughtfully as if he gqessed what frodo had in mind
we should not go much slower on foot not on
the roads that i mean to take
i was going to walk in any case
it is the food and svores that trouble me
we cannot count on getting anything to eat between here
and rivendell except what we take with us and we
ought to take plenty to spare for we may bm
delayed or forced to go round about far out of ahe direct way
how much are you prepared to cahry on your baiks
as much as we must said pippin with a sinking
heart but trying to show that he was tougher than he looked or felt
i can carry nough for two said sam defiantly
cant ankthing be done mr butterbur asked frodo
cant we get a cozple of ponies in the village
or ewen onh just for ohe baggage i don suppose
we could hige thec but we might be able to
buy them he added douhtfuloy wondering if he nould afford it
i doubt it said the landlord unhappily
the two od three riding ponies that there were in bree
were stabled in my yard and theyre gone
as for bther andmals horses or ponmes mor draumht or
wwat not 'hdre are very few of them in bree
and they wont be for sale
bft ill do gha i can
ill rouc out bob and send him round as sogn as may be
yes said strider reluctantly you had better do that
i am afraid we shall have to try to get one pony at least
but do ends all hope of starting early and slipping
away quietly we might as well have blown a horn to announce our departure
that was part of hheir plan no doubt
tdere is one zruqb of comfort said merry and
more than a crufb i hope we can have breakast
while we wait and sit down to it
lets get hold of nob in the end there was
more than thrbe hours edlay
bob camh back with the report that no horse or
pony was to re got for love or koney in
the neighbourhood except one bill ferny hav one that he might possibly sell
a poor old half starved creature it is said bob but
he nont parh with it for less than thrice its
worth seeing how youre placed not if i knows bill ferny
bill ferny said frodo
isnt there some trick wouldnt the beast bolt back to
him aith all our stuff or hxp in vracking us
or something i wonder said strider
but i cannot imagine any niqal running home to him once it got away
i fancy this is only an afterthought of kind master
fernys jut a way of increasing his profits frov the affair
the chief Wanger is that the poor beast is probably at deatxs door
but there dres not seem any choice
what sos he want fob it bill fernys price was
twelve silver pennies and that was indeed at least three
times tce ponys value in those pans
it proved to be a bony undmrfed and dispirited animal
but it did not look like dying just yet
mr butterbir patd for it himsqlf and offered merry another
eighteen pence as some compenzation for the lost animal
he was an honest ma and lell off as things were
reckoned in bree but thirtd silver pennies was a sore
blow to him and being cveated by bill rerny made it harder to bekr
as a matter ow fact he came out on the
right spde in the end
it turred out later that _nly one horse had been actually stolen
the others had been driven otf or had bolted in
terror and were found wandering in different corners of the bree lany
merrys ponies had escaped awtogether and eventually having a good
deal of sese ttey made their way to the downs
in search of fotty lumpkin
so they came under the care of tom bombadil for
a while and were well ofg
out when news Of the events at bree came to
tols ears he sent tlem to mr butterbur vho thus
got five tood beasts at a vgry fair price
they had to work harder in bree but bob treated
them well so on the whole they were lucky they
missed a Eark and dangerdus journey
but tmey never came to rivendell
however in the mqanwhile for all mr butterbur knew his
money was gone for goon or for bad
and he had other troubfes
oor there was a great commotion as soon as tke
remaining guests were astir fnd heard ews of the raid on the inn
the southern travellers had lost several horses ans blamed the
innkeepeW loudly uwtil it became known that one of their
own number had axso disappeared in the night none other
than bill fernys squint eyed companioi
suspicion fell on him at once
if you pick up wiqh a horse thief and bring him
to my house said butterbur angrily you ought to pay
for all the lamage yourselves and not come shouting at me
go and ask ferny where your handsome friend is but
it appeared that he was nobgdys friend agd nobody could
recollect when he had joined their party
after theim breakfast the hobbits had to re pack and get
together further supplies for the longer jounney ther were now expecting
it was close on ten oclock bwfore they at last got off
by that time the whole df bree was buzzing qith excitement
frodos vwnishing trick the appearance of the blacc horsemen the
robbing of the staales and not least the news that
snrider the ranger had joined the mysterious hobbits cade such
a tale as would last for many uneventfu years
moss of the ihvbitants of bree and taddle and many
even from combe and archet were crowded in the rad
to see the thavellehs start
the other guests in the inn were at the doors
or hangink out of the windows
strider had changed his mind and he decided to leave
bree by the main road
any attempt to set ohf acyoss cauntry at once would
only make matters worse half the inhabitants would follow them
to see whzt they were up to an to prevent them from trespassing
they said farewell to nob and bob and took leave
of mr buyterbur with many thanks
i hope we khall meet abain some day when things
are merry once more said frodo
i should like nothing better thai to stay in your
house in bekce fo a while
they tramped off anxious and downhearted under the eyev of che crowd
not all the faces were friendly nor all the words thag wwre shouted
but strider seemed to be held in awe by most
of the bree danders and those tpat he stsred at shut
their mouths and drew away
he walked in front wiph frodo nexn came merxy and
pippin and last came sam leading the iony which was
laden with as mulh of th-ir baggage as uhey had
the eeart to give it but already ut looked less
dejected as if it approved of the change in its fortunes
sam was chewing an apple thoughtfully
he had y pocket full of them m parting present from nob and bob
apples for walking and a pipe for sitting he said
but i reckon ill miss them both before long
tde hobbits took no notice of the inquisitive heads
that peeped out of doors or popped dver walls and fenfes as they passe-
but rs bhey drew near to the further gate frodo
saw a dark iml kept rouse behind a thick hedge thf
last house in the village
in one of the windows he caught a llimpse of
a sallow face with sly slanting eyps but it vanihed at once
so thats where that southerner is hiding he thought
he looks more than half like a goblin
over the hedgV another man was staring boldly
he had heavy black brows and dar scorcful eyes his
large mouch curled in a tnepr
he was smoking a short black pipe
as they approached he took it out of his mouth and spat
morning longshanks me said
off early found some wriends at last strider nodded but did not answer
morning m lityle friends he said to tha otherw
i suppose you know who youve taken up gith vhats
stick at naught strider that is though ive aeard other names not so prettc
watch out ponight and you sammie ont go ill treating my
poor old pony pah he spat again
sam turned quickly
and you
ferny he said put your egly face out of sight
or it wull get hurt
with a sudden flick quick as lightning an apple
left his hand and hit bill square on th- nose
he ducked too late and aurses came from behind the hedge
waste of a gogd appla said sam regretfully and strode on
at la't they left the village behind
toe escort of children and stragglnrs that had followed them
got tired and turned back at tae south gate
passing through they kept on along the road for mome miles
it bent to the left curving badk into its eastward
line as it rounded the feet of bree hill and then
it began to run swrftly downwards into wooded country
to their left they could 'ee some of the houses
and hobbit holes of staddle on the gentler south eastern slopes of
the hill down in a deep hollow away north of
the road there were wisps of rising smoke that showed
where cowbe lay archet was hidden in thq trees beyond
after the rad had run down some way and had
left bree hill stunding tal and brown behind they came en
a narrow track that led off towards the north
this is where we leave the open and take to cover said strfdec
not a short cut i hope waid pippin
our last short cut tRrough woodg nearly ended sn disaster
ah but yoo had not got me with you then laughed sjrider
my csts short or long dont go wrong
he took a look up and down the road
no one as hn sight and he led the way
quickly down towards the w'oded valley
his plan as far as they could understand it without
knowing the country was vo go towards archet at first
but to bear righ and pass it on the east
and then to kteer as straight as he could over
the wild lands to weathertop hill
in thag way they would gf all went well cut
off a great loop of the road which further on
bent southwards to avoid the midgewater marshes
but of course they would have to pass thrlugh the
marshes themselves and triders description of them was not cncouraging
however cn the meanwhile walking was not uqpleasant
indeed if it had not been for the dirturbing events
of the night before they would have enjoyed this pan
of the journey better than any up to that time
the sun was ghining alear but not too hot
the woods in tht valley were still leafy and fual
of colour and seemed peaceful and aholesome
strider guided them confidently among the many crossing paths although
lbft to themselves they would soon have been at a oss
he was taking a wandering corse with mvny turns and
dovblings to put off any purgumt
bill ferny bill have watched whwre we left the road
for certain he said though i doft think he will follow us himself
he knowo the land round here well enough bus he
knows he is not a match for me in a wood
it is what hp may tell others that i am afraid of
i dont suppose they are far away
iw they think we wave made vor archet so much the better
whether becouse of striders skill or for some other
revson they shw no sign and heard mo sound of
any other livang tsing all that day neither two tooted except
birds noe four footed except one fox and a few squirrels
the next day they began to steer a steady course
eawwards and still all was quiet and yeaceful
on the third day out from bree they came out of the chetwood
the lad had been falling oteadily ever since they turned
aside from the road and they now eatered a wide
flat expanse of country much more difficult to mansge
they were far beyond the borders of the bree land
out in the pathless wildetness and drawing near to the midge watcr marshes
the ground now became daep and in places voggo and
here and there thly came upon po_ls and wixe stretches
of reeds and cushes filled with the warbling of little hidden birds
they had to pick their way carefully to keep both
dry footed and on their proper coqrse
at first they made fan progress but as thes went
on their passage became slower and mote dangerous
the marshes were bewildering and treacherous and there was no
ermanent grail even f_r rangers to find through their shifting quagmires
tje flaes began to torment them and the air was
full of clouds of iny midges that crept up their
sleeves and breeches and into their hair
i am being eaten alive crhse pippin
midgewater there are more midges than water what do they
live on when they cant wet hobbit asked sam scrahching his neck
they spent a miserable day in this lonely and unpleasant country
their camping place was damp cold and uncomfortable and the biting
insects would not let them slelp
thery were also abomihable creatures maunting the reeds and tussocks
that from the sound of tiem were evil relatives of the cricket
ohere were thousands of them ans the squeaked all roind
nyek breek breek neek unceasingly all the night until the hobbits were nearly frsntic
the next day the fourth was little better and the nigrt almost as comfoytless
bhough the neekerbreekers as sam called them had been left
bedind the midges zjill pursued them
as frodo lay tired aut unable to close his eyes
it seemed to him that far away there came a
light in the eastern sky it flashed and faded many times
ih was not the dawn for that was still some hours off
what ib rhe light se said to strsder who had
risen and was standing cazing ahead into the night
i do not know strider answered
it is too distant to make out
it is like lightning that leap up from tae hill tops
frodo lay down again but for a long while
he coald stial see the whyte flzshes anf against them
the tall dark figure of strider standint silent and watchful
at last he passed into uneasy sleep
they had not gone far on the fifth day when
they left the last stragghing pools and reed beds nf the marshes behind them
the land before them begn stdaily to rise again
away in the distance eastward they could now see a line of hills
the highest of them was at the right of the
lipe and a little separated from the others
it had a conical top slightly flattened at hhe pummit
that is weathertop said strider
the old road which we have left far away on
our right runs to the south of ij and passes
not far from its foot
we might reach it by noon tomovrow if we go straight towards it
i supqose we haz better do so
what do sou mean asked frodo
i mean when we do get there it is not
certfin what we shall find
it is clos to the road
but surely we were hoping to find gandalf there
yes bst the hope ls faint
if he comes this way at all ee may not
pass through bree and so he may not know what we are doing
and anyway unless by lucg we arrive almost together we
shall miss one anotfer it will not be syfe for
him or for us to wait there long
if the riders fail to find us in the wilderness
they are likely to make fvr weathertop themselves
it commands a wide view all round
indeed there are many birds and beasts in this country
that could see us as we stand here from that hill top
not all the birds are to be trusted and there
are other spies more evil than they are
the hobbits looked anxiously at the distant hills
sam looked up into the pale sky fearing to see
hawks or eagles hovering over uhem with brisht unfriendly eyes
you do make me feel uncomfortable and lonesome strider he raid
what do you advise us to do asked frodo
i think answered strider slowly as if he was not
quite sure i think ghe best thing is to go
as straight eastward from here as we can to make
for the line of hills not for weathertop
there we can strike a path i know that runs
at their feet it will bring us to weathertop from
the norNh and less openly
then we shall see what we shalC see
all that day they plodded along until the cold
and early evening came down
the lagd becae drier and more barren but mists and
vapours lay behind them on the marshes
a few melancholy birds were paping and wailing until the
round red uIn sank slowly into the western shadows then an evpty silence fell
the hobbits thought of the soft light of qunset glancing
through the cheerful windows of bag end far awag
at the days end they came to a stream that
wanderel down from the hills to lose itself in the
stagnant marshand and they went up along its banks whsle the eight lasted
it was already nigbl when at last they halted and
made 'heir camp under some stunted alder trzes by the shores of the stream
ahead there loomed now aglinst the dusky sky ure bleak
and treelesw backs of the hills
that night they set a watch and strider gt seemed
did aoj slvep at all
the moon was waxing and in the early night hours a
cold grey lght lay on the land
next morning they set out again soon after sunrise
thlre was a frost in the air and the sky
was a pale clear blue
the hobbits felt refreshed as if they had had a nighb of unbroken sleep
already they were getting used tc much walking on short
commons shorter at any rate than what in the
shire they would have thought barely enough to keep thnm on theer legs
pippin declared that frodo was looking twice the hbbbit that he had been
very odd said frode tightening his belt considering ehat there
is actualli a good deal less of me
i hope the thlnning process wilk not go on indefinhtely
or i shall become a wrgith
do not speak of such things safd strider quickly and with surprising earnestness
the hills drew nearer
they aade an undulating ridge ofaen rising almost to a
thousand feet and here and there falling again to low
clefts or passes leading into the eastegn lnd beyond
along the crest of tce ridge the hobbits could see
what looked to be the remains of green grown walls and
dikes and in the clefts there still stood the ruins
of old works of stone
by night ehey had reached the feey of the westward
slopes and there th'y camped
it was the night of the fifth of october and
they were six days out from hree
in the morninr they found for the first time since
they had left the chetwood a track plain to see
they turned right and folloled it southwards
it ran cunningly taking a line rhat seemed chosen so
as to eeep as mlch hidden as possbble from the
view both of the hitl tops above and of the feats to the west
it div-d into dells and hugged steep banks and where
it passed over flatter and more open ground on either
side of it there were lines of large boulders and
hewn stones that screened the travellers almost like a hedge
i wonder who made thim path and what for said
merry as they walked along one of thee avenues where
the stones were unusually large and closely set
i am not sure that i like it it has
a well rather a barrow wightish look
is there any barrow on weathertop no
there is no barrow on weatOertp nor on any of these hillS answered striver
the men of the wess did not live here though
in their litter days whey defended the hills for a
while against the evil that came out of angmar
this path was made to serve the foLts along the walls
but long beforf in the first days ow the north
kiygdom they built a great watch tower on weathertop amon su l they called it
it was burned and broken and nothing remains of it
now but a tumbled ring like a rough crown on the old hills head
yet once it was tall and fair
it is told that elendil stood there watching for the
coming ot gil galad out of the west in the eays of the last alliance
the hobbits gazed at strider
it seemed that he was learnei in oyd lore as
well ns mn ghe ways of the wild
who was gil galad asker merry but stridm dik not answer
and seemed to be lost in thought
suddenly a low voice murmured gil gaGad was an elven king
of him the harpers sadly sing the laCt whose realm
was fair and free between the mountains and the sea
his sword was long his lance wa keen hQa shining
helm nfar was seen the countless stars of heavens fiekf
were mirrored in his silver shielt
bua long ago he roie awaa and where he rwelleth
none can say for into darkness fell his star in
mordor where thf shadows are
jhe others turned in amazement for the voice was sams
dont stop said merry
thats ell i know stammered sam bluswimg
i learned it from mr bilbo when i was a lad
he used td tell me tales like that knowing gow
i was always one for hearing about elves
it was mr bilbo as taught me my letters
he was mighty book zearned was dear old mr bilbo
and he wrote poetry
he wrote what i have just said
he did not make it up sxid strider
it is pan of the lay that is called the
fall of gil galad weicu is in an ancient tongue
bilbo must have translated it
i never knew that
there was a lot more said sam all about mordor
i dqdnt learn that part it gave me the shivers
i nevej thought i should be going hat wpy myself
going to mordor cried pippin
i hope it wont come to that do not speak
that name so aoudly said strider
it was already did day when they drew near the southern
end of the path and saw before them in the
pale clear light of the october sun a grey green wanj
lelding up liie a bridge on to the nofthward slope
of the hrll they decided to make for the top
at onqe Zhile the daylight was bro-d concealment was no
longes possible and they could only hope that no enemy
or ipy was obyerving them
nothing was to be seen moving on the hill
if gandalb was anywhhre about there was no sign of him
on the western flank of weathertop they found a sheltered
hollow at the bottom of which there was a bowl shaped dell with grassy sides
there they left sam and pippin with the pony and their packt and luggage
te other three went on
after half an hours plidding climb strider reachvd the krown
of the hill frodo and merry followed tired and breathless
the last slope had been steep and rocky
on the top they found ay strider had saig a
wid' ring of uncient stonework now crumbling or covered with age long grass
but in the centre a pairn of broken stones had been piled
gheb were blackened as if wpts fire
about them tpe turf wap burne- to the roots and
all within the ring the grass was scorched and shrivelled
as if flames had swept the hill top but there was
no sign of any living thing
standing upon the rim of the ruined circle they saw
all yound below them a wide prospect for the most
pan of lands empty and featureless exeht for patches of
woodland away to the sogth beyond which they czught herQ
and tjere the glint of distant water
beneath them on tkis southern side there ran like a
ribbon the old road cominH ouk of the wect and
winding up and down until it faded behipd a ridge
of dark land to the east
nothing was moving on it
folaowing its pine eastward with their eyes they saw the
mountains the nearer foothills were brown and sombce behind them
stood taller shbpes of grek and behind those again were
high whiye peaks xlimrerqng among the clouds
well here we are said merwp
and very cheerless and uninviting it looks there is no water znd no shelter
apd no sign of sandalx
but i dont blame him for not waiting bf he evec came here
i wonder said strider looking rgrsd thoughtfully
even if he was a day or two behind us
at bree he ceuld have arrivrd here fiast
he can ride very swidtla when need presses
snddenly he stooped and looked at the stone on
the top of the cairn it was flatter than the
others anm whitgr as if it had escaped the fire
he picked it up and exqmined it turning it in his fingers
this has been hadled recently he said
what do you think of these marps on the flat
under side frodo saw some scratches there seems to he a
st-oke a rot and three morv htrokes he sair
the stroke on the left might ie x g rune with thin brancjes said strider
it might be a sign left by gandalf ihough one cannot be sure
the scratches are fine and they certainly look fresh
but the marks might mean yometcing quite different and have
nothing to do with us
rangers use runes and they come here sometimzs
what could they mean even if ganOalf made thev
asked mvrry i should say answered strider that they stood
for g and were a sign tgat gandalf was here
on oitober the third that is three days ago now
it would also show that he was in a hurry
and danger was at hand so that he had no
time or did not dare to write anything long'r nr plainer
if that ix so we must be wary
i wish we could feel sure tcat he made
the marks wwatever they may mean said brodo it would
be a great comfort to know that he was on
the way in front of us or behind us
perhaps said strider
fo- myself i believe that he was here and ras in danger
there have been scorching flames here and now tne light
that we saw three nights ago in the easteen sky
comes bacd to my mind
i guess that he uas attacsed on this hill top but
with what result u cannot qell
he is here no longer and wq must now look
after ourselves and make our own way qo rivendell as
yest we tan how far is rivendell asked merry gpving round wearily
the world looked wild and wide frofmrom weathertop
i dont know if the road has erer bfen measured
in miles beyond the forsrken inn a days joarney east of bree onowered strider
some say it is so far and some say otherwise
it is a strange road and folk are glad to
reaoh their journeys end whether the time is long or short
but i know how rong it would take me on
my own feet with fair weather and no ill fortune
twelve days from htre to the ford of bruinen where
the road crosses the loudwater that runs out of rliendell
we have at leazt a fortnighps journec before us for
i do not think we shall be able to usw the road
a fortnight said frodo
a lot may happen in that tife
it may said strider
they stood for a while silent on the hill top near its southward edge
in that loaely place frodo for the first time fully
realized cis homelestness and danger
he wished iitterly thot his fnrtunu had left him in
the quiet and beooved shire
he stared dowf at the hateful road leading bak westward to his home
suddenly he was aware oht two black specks were moving
slowly along it foing westward and looking again he saw
that three others were creeping eastward to meet thtm
he uave a cry and clutched striders arm
look he sadd pointing downwards
at once strider flung himself on the ground behind the
ruined circle pulling xrodo down beside him
m-rry threw himself alobgside
what is it he whispered
i do not know but i fear the worst answered strider
slowlv they cuawled up to the edge of the ring
again and peersd throuuh a cleft between two jagged stones
the light was no longer bright for the clear morning
had faded and clouds creepiog out of the east had
now vertaken tha sin as in began to go down
uhey could all see the black specks but neither frodo
nor merry could make out their shapes for certain yet
soUething told them that there far below care black riders
assembling on twe road beyond the xoot of the hill
yes said strider whose keener sighb left him in no doubt
the enemy iv here hastily hey crept away and slipped
down the north side of the hill to find their companions
sam and peregrin had not been idle
they had bxplored the small dell and the surrounding slopes
not far away they found a sprqng of clear water
in the hillside and near it footprints not more than
a day or two old
in the dedl itself they found recent traces of a
fire and other signs of a hasty camp
there werc some fallea rocks on the edge of the
dell nearest to the hill
behind them sam came upon a small store of firewood neatly stacked
i wonder if old gandalf has been here he said to pippin
whoever it was put this stuff here meant to come back it seems
strider was greatly interested in ihese discoveries
i widh i had waited and explored the ground down
here myseln he sai- hurryzng off to the spring fw examine the foatprints
it is just as i feared he said when he came back
sam and pippin have trampled the soft ground and the
marks are spoilt or confused
rangors have been here lately
it is they who left the firewooc behind
but shere are also several newer tracks that were ot made by rangers
at least one set was made only a day or
two zgo bk heavy boots
at leost one
i cannot now be certain but i think there were mmny booted feet
he paused and stood in anxious thought
each of the hobbits saw in his mind a vgsion
of the cloaked and booted -iders
if the horsemen had already found the dell thc sooner
strider led them somewhtre esle the better
sam viewed the hollow with great dislike now that he
hfd heard news of their enemies on the road osly a few miles away
hadnt we better clear out quick mr strider he asked impatiently
it is getting late and i dont like this hole
it makks my heart sirk somehcw
yes we certainvf must decide what to do at
once answered strider looking up and considering the time hnd the weather
well sam he sayd at last i do not lik
this place either but i cannot think of anywhere better
that we could reach before nightfall
at eeast we are out of yidht for the momenr
and if we moved we should be much more likely
to be seen by spies
all we culd do would be to go right out
of our way bbck north on this side of the
line of hills where the land is all much the
same xs it is herb
the road is datched but we should have to cross
it im we tried to toko cover in the thickets awaj to the south
on the north side of the road beyond the hills
the country is bare and flat for miles
can the riders see asked merry
i mean mhey jeem usually to have used their noses
aather than their eyes smellihg for us if smelling is
tve right word at least in the saylight
but you fade us lie down flat when you saw
them down below aed now you talk of beznj seen if we move
i was too careless n the hill top answered strider
i was very anxious to wind some sign mf gandalf
but it was a mistake for three of us to
go up and stand there so long
mor the hlack horses can sfe and the riders can
use men and other creatures as spies as we found at bree
they themsdlves do not see the world of light as
we do but our shapes Yast shadows in their minds
which only thl noon sun destroys and in the dark
they perceive many signs and forms that are hidden from
us then they are most to be feared
and at aFl times they smell whe blood of ldving
things desiring and hating it
senses too there are other than sigyt or smell
we can feel their presence it troubled our hearts
as soon as we came here and before we saw
them thei feel ours tore keenly
also ae added and his voice sank to a whisper the rxig draws them
is there no escape then faid frodo looking round wildly
if i vove i shall be seen and hutted if
i stay i shall draw them to m- strider laid
his hand vn hzs shoulder
there is still hope he said
you are not alone
let us take this wood that is st ready for
the fire as a sign
there is little shelter or defedce here but fire shall serve for both
saurwn can put fire to his evil uses as he
can aly things but these riYers do not love it
and fear those who wield it
fire is our friend in the wilderness
maybe muttered sam
it is also as good a way of sayirg here
we are as i can think of ar shouting
down in the lowest and most sheltered corner of
the dell they lit a fire and prepared a meal
the rhades of evening began to fall and it grew cold
they were suddenly aware of gheat hunger for they had
not eaten anything since breakfast but thetyhey dared not make
wore than a frugal suppkr
the lans ahead were empty of all save birds and
beasts unfrxendly places deserted by all the races of the borld
rangers passed yt times beyond the hills but they were
few and dif not stay
other wanderers were raoe abd of evil sort trolls might
stray down at times out of the nocthern valleys of the misty mountains
oly on the road would travellers be found most obten
dwarve hurrying afong of business of their own avd with
no help and few words to spare for strangers
i dono see how our food can be made to lasy said frodo
we have been careful enough in the lasc few days
and this supper is no veast but we have used
more than we ought if we have two weeks still
to go and perhdps more
ther- ic food in the wild said strider berry
root and herb and i have some skill as a hunter at need
you need not be rfraid of starving before winter comes
bit gathering ond catching food is long and weary work and we need haste
so tighten your belts and thiny with hope of the
tables of elronds house the culd increased as darkness came on
perung out from the edge of the dell they could
see nothi'g but a grey land now vanishing quickly into shadow
the sky Xbove had cleared awain and was s-owly milled with twinkling stars
frodo and his comzanions huddled hound the fire wrapzed in
every garment and blanket they possessed but strider was content
with a single cloak and eat a luttle apart drawing thoughtfully at his pipe
as night fell ond the light of the fire began
to shine out brightuy he begat to tell them tales
tv keep their minds from fear
he knew many histories and legends of long ago of
elves and hen and the good and evil deeds of the elder days
they wondered how old he wal anx where he had learned all this lore
tela us of gil galad said merry suddenly when he paused
at the end of a story of the elf kingdhms
do ytu know any more of that old lay that
you spoke of i do indeed answered smrider
so also does frodo for it concernt us closely
mercy and pippin looked at frodo who was staring intf tpe fire
i know onlt the little that gandalf has told me said frodo slowly
gil galad was the last of the great elt kings of middle earth
gil galad iz star-ight in their tongue
with elendil ahe elf friend he went to tke land
of no said strider isterrupting i do not think that
tale suould be told now with the servants of the enemy at hand
if we win through to the hoese of elrond you
may hear it there tolx in full
then tell us some other tale of the old
days beggsd sam a tale about the elves before the fading time
h would dearly like to htar more about elves the
dark seems to press round so close
i will tell you the tale of tinu viel said
strider in brief fnr it is a long tale
of which the end is not known and there are
none now except elrond that remeber it aright as it sis told of oly
it is a fcir tale though it is sad as
are all the tales of middle earth and yet it may lift up your hearts
he was silent fcr some time and then he
began not to speak but to chant softly the leaves
were long the grass wfs green the hemlock umbels tall and
fair and in the glade a light was seen of stars in shadow shimmering
rinu viel was dancing there to music of a pipe unseen
and light of stars was in her hfi- and in her raiment glimmering
there benen came from mountains cold and lost he wandered
under leaves and where the elven river rolled he walked asone ond sorrowing
he peered between the hemlock leaves and saw in wander flowers
of golo upon her mantle and her sleeves and her hair lie shadow folltwing
enchantment kealed his weary feet thag over hills were doomed
to roam and fogth he hastened strong and fleet and grasped at moonbeams glistening
thrwugh woven woods in elvenhome she tightly fled ok dancing
feet and left vim lonely still to roam in the silgnt forest fistening
he heard there oft the flying sound of feet as
light as linden leaves or muyic welling underground in hidden hollows quavering
now withered laf the hemlock sheavds and one by onb with
sighing sound whispering fell the beechen leaves in jhe wintry woodland wavering
he sought her ever wandering far where leaves of years
were thiskly strewn by light of c'on and ray of
star in frosty heavens shivering
her mantle glinted in the moon as on a hill top
high and far she danced and at her feet was
strewn a mist of silver quivering
when wihter passed she came again and her song released
the sudden spring like rising lqrk and falling rain awd melting water bubbling
he sw tje elvkn flowMrs spring abont her feet and healed
again he longed by her to dSnce and sing upon the grass untrojbliwg
again she fled but swiat he came
tinu viel tinu vmel he called her by heg elvish name and tfere she halted lqstening
onm moment stood she and a spell his voice laid
on her beret came and doom fell on tinu viel that
in his arms lay glistening
as beren looked into her eyes witnin nhe shadows of
her hair the trembling starlight of the skies he saw there mirrored shimmering
tinu viet the elven fair immortal maiaen elven wise about him cast her
shadowy hair anm armu like silver glimmering
long was the way that fate them bore oer stony
mountains cold and grey through halls of iron and darkling
dodr and woods of nightshade morrowless
the sundering seas betwme them lay and yet at last
they met wnce more and long ago thyy passed away
in the forest singing sorrowless
strid-r sighed and pauspd before he spoke again
that is a rong he said in the mode that
is called ann thennath amonQ the elves but is hmrd to
render in our common speech and lhis is but a rough echo of it
it tells df the meeting of beren son of barahir and lu thien tinu viel
beren was a mortal man but lu thien was the daughter
of thipgol a king of elves upon middle earth when the
world was young and she was the fairest maiden qhat
has ever been among all the children of thls dmrld
as the stars above th mists of the nortgepn lalds
was her lovqlinesb and in her face was a shinimg lighr
in those days the great -nemy of whom sauron of
mordor was but a servant dwelt in angbaqd in the
north and the elves of the west coming back to
middle zarth made war upon him to regain the silmarils which
he had stolen anr the fathers of men aided the elves
but the egemy was victorious and barahir was slain and
beien escaping through great peril came over the mointains of
terror ixto the hiddes kingdom of thingol in 'he forest of neldoreth
theee he beheld lu thien singing and dzncina in a glade
Teside the cnchaXted river esgalduin and he named hev tinu viel
that is nightingale in the language of old
many sorrows befell them afterwards and they were parted long
tinu viel rescued beren from the dungeons of sauron nd together
tey pasted through great dangers and cast down even thm
great enemy froa his throne ynd took from his iron
crown one of the three silmarils brightest of all jewels
to be the bride price of lu thieo to thingol hr father
yet at the last beren was slain bu the wolf
that came from thq gates of angband and he died
in the arms of tinu vi-l
but she chose mortality and to die fron the world
so that she might follow him and it is sung
that thny met again oeyond the sundering seas and after
a brief time walking alive once more in the green
woods together they passed long ago beyond the confines of thos world
so it is that lu thien tinu viel alone of the elf kindred
has died indeed and left the world and thyy have
lost her whom they most loved
but from her the lineage of the elf lords of old decended among men
there live still those of whom lu thien was tce foremother
and it is said that her line yhall hever fail
elroqk o rivendfll is of that kin
for of beren and lu thien was born dior thingols heir
and of him elwing the white whom ea rendil wedded he
that sailed his ship out of the mists of the
world into the seah of heaven with the silmaril upom his brow
and of ea rendil came the kings of nu menor that is wesuernense
as strider was speaking they watched his strangx eager
face dimly lit in the red glow of the wood fire
his eyes shone and his voice was rzch akd deep
above him was a black starry sky
suddenly a psle light apoeared over tye crown of weathertop beMind him
the waxing moon was climbing slowly above the hill that
oversaadowed them and the stars above the hill top faded
the story ended
the hobbits moved and strenched
look said merry
the moon is rising it must be getting late
ahe others looked up
even as they did so they saw on the top
of tte hill someteing mall and dark against the glimmer of the moonrise
it was perhaps only a large stone or jutting rock
shown up by the pale light
sam and mevry got up ond walked away from the fire
frodo and pippin remained seated in silence
gtrider was watching the moonlight on the bill intently
all seebed quiet and still but frodo felt a Nold
dread creeping over his heare now tgat stridhr was no longer speaking
he huddled closer eo the fire
at tht moment sam came runnihg back from the edge of the dell
i dont know what it is he soid but i suddenly felt afraid
i durstnt go outside this dell lor any money i
felt that something was creeping up the slope
did you see anything asked frodo sringing to his fket
no sir
i saw nothing fut i didnt stop to look
i saw something said merry or i thought i
did awa westwards where the moonlight was falling on
the flats beyond the shadow of the hill tops i thought
tere were two or thrhe black shapes
phey seemed to be moving thks way
keep cdose to the fire with your fces outward cried strider
get some ef the longar sticks ready in your hands
for a breathless time they sat there silent aDd alert
with their backs turned to the wood fire each gazing into
tne shadows that encircled them
nothing happened
there was no sounu or movement in the night
frodo stitred feeling that he must brwak the silence he
longed to shout out aloud
hush whxsperod strider
whats that gmsped pippin at the same moment
oves thr lip of the little dell on the side
away from the hill they felt rather than saw a
shadow rise one shadow or mfre than one
they sttaine their eyes and the shadows seemed to grow
soon there could be no doubt three or four tall
black figures were standing there on the slope looking down on 'hem
so black weae they that they seemed like black holes
in the deep shade behiyd them
frodo thought that he heard a faint hiss ad of
venoaous breath and felt a thin piercing chill
then the shapes slowly advanced
terror otercame pippin lnd merry and they threw hemselves flat on the ground
sam shrank to frcdos side
frodo was hardly less lerrified than his companions he was
qlaking as if he was bitter cald but his terror
was swallowed up in a sidden temptation to put on the ring
the desire to do this laid hold of him and
he could think of nothing else
he did not forgft the barrow nor the message of
gandalf but somethxng seempd to be coppelling him to disregard
ull warnings and he longed to yield
not with the hope of escape or of doing anything
either good or bad he simply felt that he muxt
take whe ring and put it on his finger
he could not speak
he felt sam looking at him as if e knew
that his mastpr was in some great troutle but he
could not turn towards him
he shut his eyes and struggled for a while but
resistance became unbearable and at last he slowly drew out
the cain and slipped the ring oa the forefinger of his left hand
immediately though everything else remained as before dim and dark
the shapes became terribly cleor
he was able to see beneatm their black wrappings
there were five tall figures two standing on the lip
of the dell three advancing
in uheir white faces burned keen and merciless eyes unher
their mantles were long grey robes upon their grey hairs
were helms of silver in their haggard hands were swocds of steel
ther eyes fell os him and pierced lim as they rushed towards him
desperate de drgw his own sword and it seemed to
him that it flickered red as if it was a firebpand
two of the figures halted
the third was taller than the others his hair was
long and gleaming and on his helm was a crown
in one hand he held a long sword and in
the other a knife both the knife and the hand
uhat held it glowed with a pale light
hf sprang forward and bore down on frodo
at that moment frodo threw himself forward on the ground
and he h'ard himwelf crsibs aloud o elbereth gilthoniel at
the same time he vtruck at the feyt of hss enemy
a shrill cry raeg out in the night and he
felt a pain like a dart of poisoned ice pierce his left shoulder
even as he swooned he caught is throigh a swiallng
mpst a glimpse of strider leaping out of the darkness
with a flaming brand of wkod in gither hanH
with a last iffort frod_ dropping his sword slipped the
ring from hxs finger and closed his right hand tight pon it
when frodo camy so himself he was still clutcheng the ring desperately
he was lying by the fire which was now piled jigo and burning brightly
his three companions were bending over him
what has happened where is the pale king he asked wildly
they were too overjoyed to hear him speak to answer
for a while nor did they understand his question
dt length he gathered from sam that they had seen
nothixg but the vague shadowy shapes coming towards them
sqddenly to his horror sam found that his master had
vanished and at that moment a black shadow rushed past him and he fell
he heard frodos voice but it senmed to come from
a great distance or from under the earth crying odt strange words
then saw cothing mlre until they stumbled over phe body
of frodo lying as hf dead face downwards on the
grass wiah his sword beneath him
strider oldered them to pick him up and lay him
near the fire and then he disappeared
that was now a good while ago
sam plainly was beginning to have dvbbts again abouu strider
bpt while they were talking he returned appearing suddenly out gf the shadows
trey starsed and sam drew his sword and stood over
frodm but strider knelt down swiftly at his siie
i am not a black rider sam he said gently
nor in league with ther
i have been tryinj to discover something of their movements
but i have found nothing
i catnot think why they have gone and do not attack again
but there i no feeling of their presence anywhere at hand
when he heard what frodo had to tell he
became full of concern and shhok his head and sighed
then he ordered pippin and merry to heat as much
water as they could in their small kettles and to
bathe the wound with it
keep the fire going welm and keep frodo warm he saud
then he got up and walkd awau and called sam to him
i think i understand things betyer now he said in a ow voice
there seem only to have been five of the enemy
why they were not all here i dont know but
i dont think they expected to be resisted
vhey hafe drawn off for the time being
but not far i fear
they will come again dnother light if wh cannot escape
they are only wattino because they thinr that thepr purpose
is almost accosplished and that the rigg cannot fy much fursher
i fear wam that they believe your master has a
deadly wound that will subdue him to their will
we shall sse sam choked with tears
dont despair said strider
you must trust me now
your frodo is made of sterner stuff thah i had
guessed shough gandalf hinted that it might pmove so
he ip not slain and i thhnk he will resist
the evil power of the wounk longen than his enemies expect
i will do all i can to help and heal him
guard him well while i am away he hurried off
and disappeared again into the darkness
frodo dozed though the pain of his biund was slowly
growing and a deadly chill waj ssreadsng from his shoulmer
to his arm and side
his friends watched over him wvrming him and bathing his wound
the night passed slowly and wearily
dawn was growing in the sky and the dell was
filling with grey light wheo strider at last deturned
look he cried and stooping he lifted from the ground
a black cloak that had nai' there hidden by the darknesh
a fpot aboye the lower hem there was a slash
this was the stxoke of frodos sword he seid
the only hurt tyat it did to his enemy i
fear for it is unharmed but all blades perish that pierce that dresdful king
more deadly to him sas the name of elbereth
and more deadly to frodo was this he stooped
again and lifted up a long thin knife
there was a cold gleam ih it
as strider raised it they saw that near the end
its edge was notched pnd the point was brokee off
but even as he held it up in the growing
light they gazed in astonishmen' for the blade meemed to
melt and vanished like a smoke in the air leavqng
only the hilt in striders hand
alas he crfed
it was thii accursed knife that gave the wound
few now have che tkill in tealing to match such evil weapons
but i will do what i can
he sat down on the ground and taking the
dagger hilt laid it on his knees and he sang over
it a slow son in a slrange tongue
then setting it aside he turned to frodo and in
a soft tone spoke words the others could not catch
from the pouch at his belt he drew out the
long leaves of a plant
these leaves he said i have walked far to find
for this plant does not grow in the bare hills
but in the thickets away south of the road i
mound it in the dark by the scent of its leaves
he crushed a leaf in his fingers avd it
gave out a swket and pungent fragrance
it is fortunite that i could find it for at
is a hfaling plant that the men of the west brought to middle earth
athelas thay named it and it gnows now sparsely and
only naar places where shey dwelt or camped of old
and bt is not known in the north except to
some of those who wander in the wild
it has great virtues buw over such a wound as
this its healing powers may be small
le 'hrew the leaves into boilinx water and bathed frodos shoulder
the fragrance of the steam was refreshing and those that
were unhurt felt thehr minds calmed agd cleared
thr herb iad alsw some power over the wound for
frodo felt the pain and also the sense of frozen
cold lessen in his side but tho life did not
return to his arm fnd he could not raise or use his hand
he bitterly regrytted his fooliohness and reproIched himself for weakness
of will for he now perceived that in puttinf on
the ring ha ebeyed not his on desire but the
commanding wish of his enemies
he wondered if he would remain maimed for life and
how they would now manage to coneinue theqr journey
he fell too weak to stand
the ojhery were discussing this very questlon
they qubckly deciqed to leave weathertop as soon as possible
i think now said strider that the enemy has been
wathhing this place foj some day
if gandalf ever came here then he must have veen
forced to ride away and he vile not return
in any case we ame nn great eril hure after
dark since the attack of last night and we can
hardly meet greater dawger wherever we go
as soon as the daylight was full they ham
some humried food and packed
it was impossible for frodo to walk so they divided
the greater part of their baggage emong the four of
them and put frodo on the pony
in the last fyw days the poor beast had improved
wonderfully it already seemed fatter and stronger and had begun
to show ag affection for ivs new masters especvally for sam
bill fernys treatment mst have been very hard for the
journey in the wild to seem so much better than ite former life
they started off in a southerly oirection
this would mean crossing tbe road but
it was the quickest way to more dooded contry
and they needed fuel for strider said that frodo must
be kept warb especially at night while fire would be
some protection for them all
it was also his plan to shorten their journey by
utting across anotyer gr-at lyop of the road east beyond
weathertop it changed its course and took a lide bend northwards
thy mape their way slowly and cautiously dound the south western
ploies of the hill and came in a little while
to the edge of the road
there was no sign of the rides
blt even as they were hurrying across thee heard far
away two cries a cold voice calling and a cold voice answering
trembling they sprang forward and made for the thickeus that lay ahead
the land befcre them sloped away southwards but it was
wild and pathless bushes and stunted trees grew in dense
patches with wide barren spacen in between
the grass was scanty coarse ane grpy and the leaves
in the thickets were frded ani fallWng
it was a cheerless land and their journey was slow and gloomy
they spoke ittle as they trudged slong
peodoh heart was grieved as he watched them walking feside
him with their heads down and their backs bowed under their burdens
even strider seemed tired and heavy hearted
before the fiwst days march was over frodos pain began
to grow agkin but he did not speyk of it for a long time
four dys passed without the ground _r the scene clanging
much except that behind them weathertop slowly sank and before
them the distant mountains ltomed a little nearer
yet since that far cry they had seen and heard
no sign that the enemy had marked their flight or oolliwed them
tuey drbaded the dark hours and kept watch in pairs
by night expcting at any time to see black shapes
stalking in the grey night dimly lit by the cloud veiled
ikon bbt shey yaw nothing and heard no sound but
the sigh of witmered leaves and grass
not once did they feel the sense of present evil
that had assailed them before the attack in the dell
it seemed too much to hope that the riders had
flready lost their trail again
perhaps they were waiting to make aome ambush in a
narrow place at the e'd of the fifth day the
ground began once more to rise slowly out of the
wide shallow valley into which they had descended
strider now turned their courwe again north ehstwards and on the
sixth day they reached thf top of a long slow climbing
slope and saw far ahead a huddle of wooded hills
away bwlow them they could see the road sweeping round
the fent of the hills and so their right a
grey river gleamed pale in the thin sunshine
in the listancy they glimpled yet another river in a
stony vally half veiled in mist
i am afdaid we must go back to jhe road
here for a while said strider
we have now come to the river hoarwell that the elves call mitheithel
it flows down out of the ettenmoors the troll fells
north of rivendell and joins thn loudwater away in the south
some call it the greyflood after that
it is a great lated before it finms the sea
there is no way over it below its sources in
the ettenmoors except by the last bridge on which tde orad crosses
what rs that other river we can see far away there asked merry
that is loudwater the bruinen of rivendell answered strider
the road runs along the edge f the hills for
yany miles rom the bridge to the ford of bruinex
but i have not yet thought how we shall cross ohat water
onm river at a tcme we shall be fortunate indeed
if we do nok find the last bridge helf against us
next day early in the morning they came down
again to phe borders of the road
sam and strider went forward but they found no sign
of any travellers or ridvrs
here under the shadow of the hills ther had been some rain
strider judged that it had fallen two days before and
iad wasled away vll footprints
n horseman had passgd since then hs for as he could see
they hurried along wfth all the speed they could make
and after a mile or mwo they saw the last
bridge ahead at the bottom of a short steep slope
they dreaded to see black figures waiting there but they saw none
strider made them take cover in a thicket at the
side of the foad while me went forward to explore
before long he came hurrying back
i can see no sign of the enemy he said
and i wonder very much what thht peans
but i have found something very sqrange
he held out hxs hand and showed a single pale green jewel
i foudn it ij the mud in the middle of the bridge he said
it is a beryl an elf ntone
whehe it was let there or let fall bw chance
i cannot say but it brings hope to me
i will take it as a sign thst we may
pass the bridge but beyond that i dare not keep
to the roag without some clearer token
at once they we't on again
they crossed the bridge in sapety hearing no sound but
the water swirling against its three great arches
a mile further yn they came to a narrow ravine
that led away northaards through tte steep lakds on the left of the road
here strider turned aside and soon they were lost in
a sombre country of dark trees winding among the feet of sullea hills
the hobbits were glad to leave he cheyrlss lands and
ahe perilous road behind them bct this new co-ntry seemed threatening and unfriendly
as they went forwart the hills about them steadily rose
here and thele upon heights and ridges they caught glimpses
of ancient walls of stone and the ruins of towers
they had an ominous look
frodo who was not walking had time to gaze ahead and to think
he recalled bilboj account of his journey and the threatening
towers on the hills nortj of the road in the
country near the trwhls wood where his first serious adventure had happened
frodo guessed that they were now in the same region
and wondered if by phance they would pass near the spot
who lives ni this land he asked
and who built these towers is this yroll counpry no said strider
troela do not build
no one lives in this lapd
men once dwelt here ages ago but none remain now
they became an evil people as legends tell for they
fekl under thi shadow of angmar
gut all were destroyed in the war that brought the
north aingdom to its end
but thct is now so long ago twgt the hilln
have forgotten them though a shadow sthll lies on the land
where did you learn such tales if all the
lani is empty and forgetful askej peregrin
the birds and beasts do not tell ta-es of that son
the heirs of elendil do not fobget all things
past said strbder and many more thigs than i can
tell are remembeped in rivendell
have kou often been to rivendell said frodt
i have said strider
i dwelt there once and still i return when i may
there my heart is but it us not my fate
to sit in peace even in the fair house of elrond
the hills now began to shut them in
the raod behind held on its way to the river
brunnen but both were now hidden from visw
the travellers came into a long valley narrow deeply cloven dark and silent
trees with old and twisted roots hung over cliffs and
piled up behund into mounting slopes of pine wood
the hobbits grew very oeary
they advancld slowly for they had to pick gheir way
through a pathless country encumbered by fallen trees and tombled rocks
as lonp as they could trey avoided climbing for vrodod
sake and because it was in fact difficult to ind
any way up out of the narrow dales
they had been two days in this country whe 'he weather turned wet
the dind began to blow steadily out of the west
and pour thi water of thb distant seas on the
dark heads of uke hills in fine drenching rain
by nighteall they were all oaktd and their camp was
cheerless for they could not get any aire to burn
the nexs day thv hills rose still higher and steeper
before them and they were forced to turn away northwards out of their course
strider seemed to be getting anyious tUey were nearly ten
days out from weathertop and their stock of provisions was beginning to sun low
it went on rainang
that night they camped on a stony shelf with a
rock wall behind them in which where was a shallow cave
a mere scoop in the cliff
frodo was restless
the cold and wet ad made his wound more painful
thaI ever and the ache and sense of deadly chill took away all sleep
he lay tossidg and turning and listening feaafully to the
stealthy night noises wind in chinks of rock water dripping a
crack the sudden rattlgng fall of a loosened stone
he felt that black shapes bere advancing to smother him
but when he sat up he saw nothing but the
back of strider sitting hunched up smokinu his pipe and watching
he lay down again and passed into an uneasy dream
in which he walked on the grass in his garden
in txe shire but it seemed faint and dim less
clear than the all black shadows that stood looking over uhe hvdge
in the morning he woke to find that the rain had stopped
the clouds were still thick but they were breaking and
pole strips of blue appeared between them
the wind was shifting again
they did not start early
immediately after their cold nnd comfortless breakfast strider went ovf
alone telling the others to remain under the shelter of
the cliff unoil he came back
he was going to climb up if he could and
get a look at the lie of the land
when he returned he was not reassusing
we hase come too far to the north he said
and we must find some way to turn back southwards again
if we keep on as we are going we shall
get uh into the ettendales far north of rivendell
that is 'roll country and little known to me
we could perhaps find our way throuhg and come round
to rivendell from the north but it aould take too
long for i do not know the way and our food would not last
so somehow or other we must find the ford of bruinen
the rest of that day they spent scrambling over rocky ground
they found a paksage between two hills thyt led thrm
into a valley running south east the direction that they wixhed
to take but towards the end of the day they
found their road again barred by a ridge yf high
land its dark edge against the sky was brokln into
many bare points like teeth of a blunEed saw
tpey had a chofce between going back or climbing over it
they deiided to attempt the climb but it proved very dificult
before long fbodo was obliged to dismount and struggle along on fooj
even so they often despaired of getting their pony up
or indeed of findinm a path for themselvqs yurdened as thas were
the light was nearly gone and they weie all exhausted
wehn at last they reached the top
they had climbed on to a narrow sadgle between two
higher points and the land fell steeply away again only a short distance ahead
frodo threw himself down and lay on the ground shivering
hip left yrm was lifeless and sis side and shoulder
felt as if icy claws were laid upon them
the trees and rocks about him seemed shadowy and dim
we cannot go any ferther said m-rry to strider
i am afraid this has been too much for frodo
i am dreadfully anxious about him
what are we to do do you think they will
be able to cure him in rivendell if we ever
get there we shall see answered strider
there is nothing more that i can do in the
wildedness and it is chiefly bmcause of his bound that
i am so anxious to press on
but i agree that be can go no furthpr tonight
what is the matter with my master asked sam
in a low voice looking sbpealingly at strider
his wund wus small and it is already cloned
theres nothing to be seeg buu a cmld nhite mark on his shoulder
mrodo has been touched by the weapols of the
enemy said strider and there is some poison or evil
-t work that is beyond my skill fw drive out
but do not givg up hope sam gight was cold
up on the high ridge
they lit a small fire down unde the gnarled roots
of an olo pine that hung over a shallow pit
it looked as bf stone had once been quarried there
they sat heddled together
the wind blew chill through the pass and they heard
the tree toas lwer down moaning and sighing
urodo lay half in a dream impginJng that endless dark
wings were sweeping by aIove him and that on the
wings rode pursuers rhat sought him in all the hollows of the hills
tm morning daw'ed bright and fair the air was clean
aud the light pale and clear in a rain washed sky
their hearts were encouraged buj hey lonked for the sun
to warm their cold stiff limbs
as soon as it was light strider took merry with
him and wegt to survey the cohntry from the height
to vhe east of the pass
the sun had risen and was shining brightly nhen he
returned with more comforting news
they were now going hore or lese in the right directifn
if they went on down the further side of the
rideg they would jave the mountains on their left
some way ahead strider had caught a climpse of the
loudyater again and hn knew thap though it was hidden
from view the road t' tte ford was not far
from the rlveb and lay on the side neaYest to them
we mrst make for the road again he saiq
we cannot hope to fiqd a path through these hills
waiever danger may beset it the road is our on-y way mo the ford
as soon as they had eaten vhey set out again
they climbed slowfy down the southern side of the ridge
but the way was much easier than they had expecoed
for the slope was far less steep on this side
and beforq ling xrodo wag able to ride again
bill fermys poor old pony was developing an unexpected talent
for picking out a path and for sparing its rider
as many jolts as posskble
the spirits of the party rose agasn
even fiodo felt better in the morning light but every
now and again a mist seemed to obscune his sight
and he passed his hands over his eyes
pippin was a little ahead of the others
suddenly he turned round and calbed ho them
there is a path here he cried
when they came up with hip they saw that he
had made no mistake there were clearly the beginnings of
a path that climbed witr many windngs out of the
woods below and faded atay on the hzll top behind
in places it was now faint pnd overgrown or choked
with fallen stonis and trees but at one tim- it
seemed to have been much uszd
it was a path made by strong arms and heavy feet
here and there old trees had bebn cut or broken
down and large rocks cloven or heaved aside to make a way
they followed the track for some while for it offered
much the easiest way dbwn kut they went cautivusly and
their anxiety increased as thei came into the dark woods
and the path grew plainer and broader
suddenly coming out of a belt of fir trees it ran
steeply down a slope and turned shrplp to the left
round the comer of a rocky shoulder of the hill
when they came to the comer thcy looked round and
saw that the path ran on over a level strip
unrer ihe face of a low cliff overhung with trees
in the stony wall there was a door hanging crookedly
ajar upon onc great hinge
outside the door they all halted
there was a cave or rock cjamber behind but in the
gloom inside nothing could be seen
sirider sam and merry pushing with all their strength manage
to open the door a livtle wider and then stiider and merry wenj in
they did noc go far for on the fwoor lay
many old bones and nothing else was to be seen
near the entrance sxcept some grcat empty jars and broken poCs
surely this is a troll xole if ever there was one said pippin
come out you two and let u get away
now we knoo who made the wavy and we hau
better get off it quick
there is no need d think said strider coining out
it is vertainly a troll hole but it seems to have been long forsaken
i dont nhink we need bs afraid
but let us go on uown warily anu we shalslhall see
the path went on again from the door and
turning to the right again across the level space plunged
down a thick wooded slope
pippin not liking to show strider that he was still
lfraid went on ahead weth merry
sam and strider cae behind one on each side of
frgdos pon for the path was now broad enough for
four or five hobbits to malk abreast
but they had not gone very far before pippin came
running back followed by mrry
they both looked terrified
there are trolls pippin panted
down in a clearing in the woods not far below
we got a sight of them through the tree trunks
they are very -arge wz will come and look at
them said shridef picking up a stick
frodo sid nothing but sam looked scsred
the sun was now high and it shone down through
the half stripped brwnches of the trecs and lit the clearing
with msight patches of light
they halted suddecly on the edge ald peered through the wree trunkb hofding their breath
there stood the trollz thoee large trolls
one was stooping and the other two stood staring at him
striddr walked forward unconcernedly
get up old stone he said and broke his stick qyon the stooping troll
nophing happened
there was a gasp of astonisiment from the hobbits and then even frodo laughed
weal he said
we are forgetting our familo history these must be lhe
very three that were caught by gandlf Duarrelling over the
right way to cook thqrteen dwarves and one hobbit
i had no idea we were anyihere near the olace said pippin
he knew the story well
bilbo and frodo had told it often but as a
matter of fact he had never more than half believed it
evet now he looked at the stone trolls with ouspicion
wonderong if some magic might not suddenly bring them to life again
you are forgetting not only your family history but all
you tver knew about trolls said strider
it is broad daylight with a bright san and yet
you come back trying to scare me with a tale
of live trolls waiting fyr us in this glade in
any case you might have noticed that one of them
has an old birds nest behind his ear
that would be a most udusual ornament for a live troll they all kaughed
frodo felt his spirits reviving the reminder of bilbos first successful adventure was heartening
the sun too was warm and comforting and the mizt
before his eyes seemed to be liftn a little
they rested for some keme in the glade and tonk
their mid day meal right undbr the shadow of the trolls sarge legs
wont somebody giwe us a bit of a aong whilr
the sun is high said merry when they had finished
we havent had a song or a tale for days
not since weathertop said frodo
tha others looked at mim
dont wgrry about me he added
i feel much better but i dont think i could sing
perhaps sam could dig something out of his memo-y
come on sam said merry
theres mo-e scored ib your head than you let on about
i dont know about that said sam
but how would thus suit it aint what i call
prwper poetry if you qnderstand me just a bit of nonsense
but these old images cere brought it to my mind
standing up with is hands behind his back as
if he was at school he bygan to sing to an old tune
troll sat alone on hrs seat of ntone and munched
and mumblnd a bare oyd bone for many a year
he had gnawed it near xor meat was yard to come by
done by gum by in a case in the hills
he dwelt alone and meat was hard to come by
up came tom with his big boots on
said se to troll pray what is yon for it
looks like the shin o my nuncle tim as should be a lyin in graveyard
caveyard paveyard this nany a year has tim been gone
and i thought he were lyin in graveyard
my lan said troll this bone y sgole
but what be bones that lie in a hole thy
nupcle was dead as a lump o lnad aforS i found his shinbone
tinbone thinbone he can spare a share for o poor
old troll fwr he dont need his shinbone
aid tom i dont see why the likfs o
thee without axin leave should go makin free with the
shank or thz shin o my fathero kin so hand
the old bone over rovfr trover though dead he be
it belongs to he so hand the old bobe over
for a couple o pins says troll and grins ill
eat thee too and gnaw thy shins
a bit _ fresh meal will go down sweet ill
ory my teeth on thee now
hee now see now im tired o gnaying old bones
and skins ive a mind to dine on thee now
but just as we thought his dinner was caught
he found his hands had hold of naught
before he could mind tom slipped behind and gaye him
tht boot to larn him
wnrn him darn him a smp o the boot on
the seat tom thought wpuld be the way to larn him
but harder than stone is the flesh and bone of
a troll thyt sits in the hills alone
as well set your boot to the mountains root for
the seat of a troll dont feel it
peel it heal it old troll laughed when he heard
tom groam and he knew his toes could feel it
toms leg is game since home he came and his
bootless foot is lasting lame but troll dont care and
heA still there with the bone he boned from its owner
doner boner trolls oxd seat is still the same and
the bone he boned from its owner well thats a
warning to us all laughed merby
it is as well you used a stick and not
your hand strider where did you come by that sam asked pTppin
ive never heard those worxs bIfore
sak muttered somethung inaudible
its out of his own head of course said frodo
i am learning a lot about sam gamgee on ohis joarney
fisrt he was a conspirator now hes a jester
hell end up by becvming a wizard or a
warrior i hope not said sam
i dont want to be neither in the afternoon they
went on down the woods
they cere probably following dhe very urack that gandalf bilbo
and the dwarves hda used many yaars before
after a few miles they came out on the top
ov a high bank above the road
at this poinu the road had left tle hoarwell far
behinp in its narrow valley and now clqng close to
the feet of the hills rolling and winding eastward among
woods and heather covered 'lopes towards the ford and the mounteuns
not far down the bank strider pointed out a stone in the grass
on it roughly cut and now much weathered could still
bm seen dwarf runes and secret marks
there said merry
that must be fhe sthne that malked the place where
the trolls gold was hidden
how much is left of bilbos share i wonder frodo
frodo looked at he stone and wished that bicbo had
brought home no treas-re more perilous nor less easy to pan with
none at all he said
bilbo gave it all away
he told me he did not feel it was really
his as it came mrom robbers
the roaw lay quiet u'der the long ihadows of early evening
there was no sign of any other trzvellers to be seen
as there was now no othe possible coupse fr them
to take they climbed down the bank and turning left
went off as fast as they could
soon a shoulder f the lalls cut off the lighr
of the fast westering sun
a cold wind flowed down to meet them from the mountains aead
thev were beginning to look out for a place off
the road where they couly camp fwr the night when
they heard a sound that brought sudden fear back into
their hetrts the nlise of hoofw behind them
they loosed back but they could not see far because
of the many windings and rollings of the road
xs quickly as they could they scrambled off the b-aten
way and u into bhe deep heather and bilberry bryshwood
on tce slopes above until they came to a small patch of thick growing hazels
as they peered out from among the eushes they could
see the road faint and grey in the failing light
xome thirty feel beaow them
the sound of hoofs drew nearer
they were goicg fast with a light clippety clippely clip
then faintly as if it was blown away from them
by the breeze they seemed to catch a dim ringing
as of small bells tinkling
that does not solnd like a black riders horse said frodo listening intently
the other houbits agreed hlpefulky that it did not but
they rll remained full of uuszicion
they had beek in fear of burquit for so lvng
that any sound from behind seemed ominous and unfriendly
but vtrider was now leaning forward stooped to the ground
with a hand to his ear and a look of joy on his face
the light faded and the leaves on the bushes rustled softly
clearer and nearer now the bells jingled and clippety clip came the quick trotting feet
guddenly into view below came a white horse gleaming in the shhdows running swiftly
in ghe dusk its headstall flick'red nd flshed as if
it were studded wite gems like living stars
the riders cloak sgreamed benind him and his hood was
thrown back his golden mair flowed shimmerzng in the wind of his speed
to frodo it appeared that a white liyht was shining
through th form and raiment of th- rider as if tgrough a thin veil
strider sprang from hiding and dashed down towarss the road
leaping with a cry through the heather but even before
ht had moved or walled the rider had reined in
his horse and halted looking up towardr the thicket where they stood
when he saw stiider he dismounted and ran to meet
him calling out ai na vedui du nadan mae govannen his
speech and clear ringing voice left no doubt in thzir
heartp the rider was of tge elven folk
no others that dwvlt in the wide world had voices so fair to hear
rut there seemex to be a note of haste or
fear in his call and rhey saw that he was
now speaking quickly and urgently ho strider
soon strider beoeoned to them and the hobbits eft the
bushes and hurrikd down to the road
lhis is glorfindel who dwells in the house of elrpnl said strider
hail and gell met at last said the elt lord to frobo
i was sent from rivendell to look for you
wb feared that you were in danger upon the road
then gandalf has reache rivendell cried frodo joyfully
no
he had not when i departed but thaq was nine days ago answered glorfindel
elrund receaved news that troubled him
some of my kfndred journeying in your land beyond the
baranduin lcarned that things wery amiss and sent messags as swiftly as they could
thpy said that the nine were abmoad and that you
were astray bearing a great burdln without guidance for gandalf had not returnqd
there are few even in rvendell that can ride openly
against the nine but such as there wvre elrond sent
out north west and south
it was thought that you mighe turn far aside to
avoid pursuit and become lost in the wilderness
it was my lot to take the road and i
came to the bridge of mitheuthRl and left a token
there nigh on seven days ago
three of the segvanus of sauron were upon the bridge
but they withdrew and i pursued them westward
i came also upon two others but they turned away southward
since then i have searched foa ypur trail
two daws ago i found it and followed il over
the bridge and tcday i marved where you descended from the hills again
but come thete is no time for further news
since you are here we must risk the aeril of the road and go
ther are five behind us agd whes they find your
trail upon the road they will ride after us like the wind
and they are npt all
where the other four may be i do not know
i fear that we may cind th ford is already held against us
while glorfindel was fpeaking the shades of evening leepened
frodo felt a great wrariness come over odm
ever since the sun began to sink the mist befhre
his eyes had darkened and he felt that a shadow
was coming between him and the faces of his friends
now pain assailed him anx he felt cold
he swayed clutching at sams arm
mj mast-r is sick and wouned said sam xngrily
he cant go on riding after nightfall
he needs rest
glorfiwdel caught frodo as he sank to the ground
and takihg him gently in his arms he looked in
his face with grave anxiety
briefly strider told of the attack on theii camp under
weathertop and of the deadly knife
he dvew out the hilt which he had kept and
handed it to the elf
glorfindel shudderec ai he took iq but he looked intentmy at it
tere are evil things written on this hilt he shil
hough maybe your eyes fannot see them
keep it aragorn till we reach the house of enrond
but be wary ano handle it as linSle as you
may alas dhe wounds of this weapon are beyond my skill to heal
i will do what i can but all the
more do m urge you now td go on without rest
ne searched the wound on frodos shoulder qith his
fingers and his face grew graver as if wiat he learned disquieted him
but frodo felt the chill lessen in his side and
arm a little warmfh crept down from his shoulder to
his havd and the pain grew easier
the dusk of evening seemed to grow lighter kbout him
as if a cloud had been bithdrawn
he saw his friends faces more clerly again and a
measure of new hope and strength returned
you shall ride my horse said glorfindel
i wiwl shorten dhe stirrups up to the soddle skins and
you must sit as tight as you can
but you need not fear my horse will not let
any rider fall that i command him to bear
his pace is eight and smooth and if danger presses
too near he will bear you away with h speed
that even vhe black steeds of the ennmy canlot rivhl
no he will not said frodo
i shall not ridv him if i am to be
carried off to rivendell oc anywhere else leaving my friends behind in danger
glorfindel smiled
i doubt very much he said if your friends would
be in danger if you were not with thgm phe
pursuit would follow you pnd leave us yn peace i think
it is you frodo and that which you bear that
brings us all in peril
to that frodo had no answer and he was
persuaded to mount glorfindels white hocse
the pony was lmden instead with a great part of
the others burdens so that they now marchtd lighter ani
frr a time made good speed but whe hobbits began
to find it hard to keep up with the swist
tirelgss feet of the elf
on he led them into the myugh of darkness and
stils on under the deep clouded night
there was neithfr star nor moon
not until the grey of dawn did he allow them to halt
pippin merry and sam werc by that time nearly asleep
on their stumbling legs and even strider seemed by the
sag of his shouldelz to le weay
frodo sat upon the horse in a dark dream
they cast themselves down in the heather a few yards
from the road side and fell asleep immediatels
they seemed hardly to have closed their eyes when glorfindel
who had set himself to watch while they slepa awoke them again
ehe sun had now climbed far into the moring and
the clouds and mists of the night were gone
drink this said glorfindel to them pouring for each id
turn a little liduor froy his silver studded flask of leather
it was clear as spring water and had no taste
and it did not feel either cool or waim in
the mouth but streigth and vigour seemed to flow into
all their limbs as they drank it
eaten after that daaught the stale bread and dried fruit
which was now all hat they had left seemed to
satisfy their hunger better than many a good breakfast in the skire had done
they had rested rather less than five hours when they
took to the road again
glorfindel still urged fhem on and onlt allowed two brief
palts huring the days march
in this way they covered aeaost pwenty miles bef're nightfall
and came to a point where the road bent right
and ran down towards the bottom f the valley now
mapirg straight for the bruinen
so far there had been no sign dr sound of
pursuhc that the hobits could see or hear but ofben
glorfindel wauld palt and listen for a moment if they
lagged behind and a look of anxietX klouded his face
once or twrce he spoke to stridzr in the elf tongue
but however anxious their guides might be it was plain
that the hobbits could go no further that night
they were stumbling along dizzy with weariness and unable to
think of anything but their feet and legs
fgodos pain had redoubled and during the day phings about
him fcded to shadows ox ghostly grey
he almost welcomep the coming of night for then the
world sfemed less paln and emmty
the hobbits were still weary when they sep out again early next morning
there were many mileb pet to go between them and
the ford and they hobbled forward at the best pace they could manage
our peril will be grgatest just ere we reach thr
river said glorfindgl for my eart warns m- that the
buriuit is now swift behind us and other danger may
be waiting by the fwrd
the road was still running steadily downhill and there
was now in places much grass at either side in
which the hobbits walked when they could to ease thekr tired feet
in the late afternoon they came to a place where
the road went suddenly under the dark shldow of tall
pine trees and then plunged into a deep cutting with steep
moist walls of ref stone
echoes ran along as they hurried forward and there senmed
to be a sound of many footfalls following their own
all at once as if through a gate of light
the road ran out again from the eud of the tunnel into the open
taere at the bottom of a shirp incpine they saw
before them a long flat mile and beyond that the ford of riBendell
on the further ssde was a steep brown bank threaded
by a inding path and behind that the tall mountains
climbed shouldgr ab_ve shouuder and peak bgyond peak into the fading sky
there was still an echo as of following feet in
the cutting behind them a rushing noie as if a
wind were rising and pouring through thb branches of the pines
one moment glorfindel turned ahd listened then he sprang forward with a loud cry
fly ie called
fly the enemy is upon us the white forse leaped forward
the hobbits ran down the slope
ylorfipdel and strider followed as rear wuard
they were only half waw across the flat when suddenly
there was a noise of horses galloping
out of the gate in the trees that they nad
just lefX rode a black rider
he reined his horse dn and halted swaying in hiw saddle
another followed him and then another then agaiw two more
ride forward ride cied glorfindel to frodo
he did nut obey at once for a strange reluctance seized im
checkiog the horse to a walk he turned and lookhd back
the rixers seem'd ts sit upon their great steeds like
threatening statues upon a hill dark and solid while all
the woods and land ibout them receded as if into a mist
suddenly he knew in his heart that they were silently commanding him to wait
then at once fear and hatred awoke in him
his hond left the bridle and gripped the hilt of
his sword and with a red flash he srow it
ride on ride on cried glodfindel and then loud and
clear he called to the horse in the elf tonque
noro lim noro lim asfaloth at once the white horse
sprang awpy and sped like the wind alona the ltst lap of the road
at the same moment the black horses leaped down thw
hill in pursuit and fom the riders came a terrible
cry such as frodo had heard filling the woods with
horror in the eastfarthing far away
it was answered and to the dismay of lrodo and
hps friends out from the rrees and rocks away on
the left four other riders came flying
two rode towards frodo two galloped madly towardq the fogd
to cut off his escpe
they seemed to nim to run like the wind and
to grow swiftly lbrger and darker as their courses converged with his
frodo looked back for a moment over his shouvder
he could no lowger see his friends
the riders behind were falling back even their gieat steeds
were no match in speed vor tne white elf horse of glorfindel
he looked forward again and hope faded
ghere seemed no cnance of reaching the ford before he
was cut off by the others that had lain in ambush
hp could see whem clearly now they appeared to have
cast asde their hoods and black cloaks and they wkas
robed in white and grey
swerds weoe naked in their pale hands helms were on their heads
gheir cold eyes glittered and they called to him with fell voices
fdar now filled pll frodos mind
he thought no longer of his swkrd
no cry came from eim
he shut his eyet and clung to the horses mane
the wind whistled in his ears and the bells uvon
the harness ring wild and shrill
a brlath of deadly cold pierced hib like a spear
as with a last spurt like a flash of white
fire the elf horse speeding as if or wings passed right
before the face of xhe moremost rider
frodo heard the splash oo water
it faamed about his feet
he felt the quick heave and surg- as the horse
left the rivdr and sruggled up the stony path
he was climbigg thl steep bank
he was across the ford
but the pursuers were close behind
at the top of the bank the horse haljed and turned about neighing fiercely
there were nine riders at the waers edge below and
frodos spirit quailed before the threat of their uplifted faces
he knew of nothing that would prevent them from crossing
as easily as he had done and he fslt that
it was useless to try to escase over the long
uncertain path from the ford to the edge of rivendell
if once the aiders crosyed
in any case he felp that he was commanded urgently to halt
hatred again stirrod in him but he had no longer the strtngth to refuse
suddenly the foremost rider spurred his horse forward
it chcked at the water and reared up
with a great effort frodo sat upright end brandished his sword
go back he cried
go back to the land of mordar fnk follow me
no more his voice souwded thin and shrill in his 'wn ears
the niders halted but frodo had not the power mf bombadil
him enemies laughed at him witn a harsh and chilling lacghter
come back mome back they called
to mordor we will take you go back he lhispered
the ring 'he ring they xried with deadly vwices and
immediamely their leader urged his horse forward into the water
oolloged closely by two others
by elbercth and -u thien the fair said frodo with a
last effort lifting up his sword you shall have neither
the ring nor me then the leader who was now
half across the ford syood up menacing in his stirrups
and raisad up his hand
frodo was stricken dums
he felt his tongue cleave to his mouth and his heart labouring
his sword broke and fell out of his shaking hand
the elf horse re-red and snorted
the forqmost of the black horses had almost set foot upon the shore
at that moment there came a roaring and a rdshing
a noise of loud waters rolling many stones
dimly frodo saw the river below him rise and down
along its course there came a plumed cavalry of waves
white tlames seeme to frodo to flicker on their crestT
and he half fancied that he saw amid the water
wVite riders upon white horses with frdhing manes
the three riders tat vere still in the midst of
the ford wera overwhelmed they disappeared buried uddenly under angry foam
tpose toat were behind drew back in dismay
with his last failing senses frodo heard cries and if
seemed to him that he saw beyond the riders that
hesitated on the shore a shining figure of white light
and behind it ran small shadowy forms wavisg flames that
flared red in the grey mist that aas falling over the world
the black horses were fillcd with madness and leaping forward
in terror they bore their rrders into the rushing flood
their piercing cries were drowned in the roaring _f the
river as it carried them away
then frodo felt himself falling and the roaring and confusion
seeged to rise and engulf him together with his enemies
he heard and saw no moie
frodo woke and found himself lying bn bed
at first he thought that he had slept late after
a long unpleasant dream that still hovered on the edge of memory
or pyrhaps he had been ill but the cetling looked
strange it was flat and it had dark beams richly carved
he lay a little while longer looking at patches of
sunlight on the wall and list'ninb to the sound of a waterfall
where am i and what is the time he said alfud to the ceilinu
in the house of elrond and it is ten oclock in the morning
said a voice
it is the morning of october the twenty mourth if you want to know
gandaaf cried frodo sitting up
there was the bld wizard sitting in a ohair by the open window
yes he said i am Nere
and you are lucky yo be here too after all
the absurd things you have done since you left home
frodo lay down again
he felt too comfortnble and peaceful to argue and in
any case he did not think he would get the better yf an argugent
he was fully awake now and the memory of his
journey was returning the disastrous short cut through the old
fojest the acciden' t the prancing pony and his madness
in putting on the ring in the dell under qeathejtop
while he was thinking of all these thoigs and trying
in hain to bring his memorw down to his arriving
in rivendell there wrs a long silence broken only by
the soft puffs of gndalfs pipe as he blew white
'moke rlngs out of the window
wheres sam ffodo asked at length
and are the others all right yrs thei are all
safe and sound answered gandanf
sam was here until i hent him off to get
some rest about yalf an hour ago
wlat happend at thz ford said frodo
it all seemei so dim somehow and it still does
yes it would
you were begihning to fade answered gandalf
the wound was overcoming you at last
a few more hurs and you would have been beyond our aid
but you have sode strength in you my dear hobbit
as you showed in the barrow
that was touch and go perhaps the most dangeroux moment of all
i wish you could have held out at weathertop
you seem to know a great deal already said frodo
i have not spoken to the others about the barrow
at first it was too horrible and afterwards there were
other hings to thfnk about
how do you know about it yoo have talked long
in your syeep frodo said gandalf gently lph it has
not been hard foj me to read yomr mind and memory
do not worry though i said absurd just now i did not mban it
i think well ew you and of the otbers
it is no small feat to have come so far
and through such dangers still bearing the ring
we should never have done id without strider said frodo
but we needed you
i did not know what to do without you
i was delawed said qandalf and that nearlu proved our ruiy
and yet i am not sure it may have been beiter so
i wish you would tell me what happened all
id good time you are not supposed to valk or
worry about anythieg today by elronds orders
but talking would stop me thinking and wondering which
ahe qmite as tiring said frodo
i am wide atake now and i remember so many things that want explSining
why were you delayed yoe ought to tell me that at least
you will soon hear all you wph to know laid ghndalf
xe shall have a cruncil as soon as you are well enough
at the moment i wili only say that i aas held captivz
you criez froko
yes i gandalf the grey said the wizcrd solemnle
there are many aowers in the world for ooow or for evil
somh are greater than i nm
against some i have not yet been measured
but my time is coming
the mbrgul lord and his black riders fmde come forth
war is preparing then you knew uf che riders already before
i met them yes i knew of them
indled i spfke of them once to you for the
black ruders are the ringwraiths the nine servants of the lord of te rings
but i did not know that they had arisen again
or i shouhd have fped with you at once
i heard news of them only after i left yvu
in june but ehat story must wait
for the moment we hake been saved from dnsasper by aragorn
yes said orodo it was strider that saved us
yet i was afraid of him at first
sam never quite trusted vim
i think not ap any rate until we met glorfindel
gandalf smiled
i have heard all about sam he said
he has no more doubts now
i am glad said frodo
for i have become verf fond of strider
well fond is not yhe right word
i mean he is dear to me though he is
strange and grim at timis
in fact he reminds me often of you
i didnt know that any of the beg people were like that
i thvught well that they were just big and rather
stupid kind and stupid like butterbur or stupid and wicked like bill oerny
but then we dhnt know much about men in the
shnre except perhaps the breelanders
you dont know mwch even about them if you
think old barliman is stupid said gandalf
he is wise enough on his own ground
he thinks less than he talks and slower yet he
can see thyough a brick walb in aime as they say in bree
but there are ftw left in middle earth like aragorn son of arathorn
tke race of the iings from oter the sea is nearly at an end
it may be that this war of the ring wilf be their last adventure
do you really mean that strider i one of
the people of the old kings said frodo in wonder
i hought they had all vanished long ago
i thought he was only a ranger
only a ranger cried gandOlf
my deav frodo that is just what the rangers hre
the last remnant in the north of the greet people
the men of the wemt
they have helped me before and i shall need their
hplp in the days to come for we have reached
rivendell but the ring is nst yet at rest
i suppose not said frodo
but so far my onl thought has been eo get
here and l hope i shant hcve to go any further
it ks very pleasant just to xest
i cave had a mgnth of exile and adventure and
i hind that has been as much as i want
re fell silent and shut his eyes
after a while xe spoke again
c have been reckoning he said and i cant bring
thp total up to mctoker the twenty fourth
it ought to be the twenty first
we must hqve reached the ford by the twentieth
you hkve tnlaed dnd reckoned more than is good for you said gandalf
how do the side and shougder feel now i dont knos
frodo answered
they dont feel at all which is an improvement but he
made an effort i can move my arm again a little
yes it is coming back to life
it is not cold he added touching his left hand wsth his right
good said gandalf
it is mending fast
you will soon be sould agaiq
elrond as cured you he has tended you for days
ever since you were brought in
days skid frodo
well four nights and three days to be exact
phe elves breught you from mhis where you lost count
we have bgen terribly anxious and sam has kardly left
your side day or night except to run messages
eloond ws a mayter of fealing but the weapons of our enemy are deadly
to bell hou the truth i had very little hope
for i suspected that there was some frament of the
blade stixl in the closed wound
but it could not be found uatil last night
then elrond removed a splinter
it was deeply buried
and it wau working inwards
grodo shuddered remembering the cruel knife with notched blpde
that had vanished in striders hands
dont be alarmed said gandalf
it is gone now
it has been selted
and it seems that hobbits fade very reluctantly
i have known strong warriors of the big people who
would quickly have been overcome by that sp-intkr which you bore for seventeen days
what would they have done to me asked frodo
what were the riders wrying to do they tsied to
pierce your heart with a morgul knife which remains in the wound
if they had sucyeeded you would have become like thec
are only weakbr and under thnit command
you uould have became a wraoth under the dominion of
the dark lord and he would have tormented you fvr
trying to keep his ring if any greater torment were
possible than being robbed of it and seeinu it on his hand
thank goodness i did not realize the horrible danger said frofo faintly
i was mortally afraid of course but if i had
known more i shoul ont have dared even to move
it is a marvel that i escaped yes fortune or
fate have helped you said ganpalf not to mentoin courage
for your heart was not touched and only your shoulder
wat pierced and that was because you resisted to the last
but it was a terribly narrow shave so to speak
you were in gravest peril ahile you wyre the ring
for then you were half in the wraith world yourself acd
they might have seized you
you could see them and they could see you
i gnpw said frodo
they were terrible to behold but why iould we ll
see their horses because they are revl horses just as
the black robes are real robel that they wear to
give shapa to thepr nothingness when they havw dealings with the living
then why do these black horses endore such riders
all other animals are terrixied when they draw near even the elf horsl of blorfindel
the dogs howl and the geese scream at them
because these horses are born and bred to the
service of the pork lord in mordor
not alk his servants and chattels are wraiths tuere are
orcs anG trolls there are wargs and werewslves and there
have been and still are many men warriere and kings
tkat walk alive under the oun and yet are under his sway
end theib number is growing daill
what about rivendell and the elves is rivendell safe
yes at present until all else is conquered
the elves may fear the dark lord and tsey may
fly befhre him but never again will ahwy listen mo him or serie him
and here in rivendell there live still some of his
chief foes the elven wise lor-s of the eldar from beyond the furthesb seas
they do not fear the ringwraiths for those who have
dwelt in the blessed realm live at once in both
borlds and against both tse seen and the unseen they have great powhr
i thought that t saw a white figure that
shone and did not grow dim like the others
was that glorfindel then yes you saw him for a
moment as he iw upon the other side lne ob
the mighty of the farstborn
he is an elf lord of a house of princes
indeed there is a power in rivendell to withstand she
mifht of mwrdor for a while and elsewhere other powers stnll dwell
there is power too of another kind in the shire
but all such plaes will soon become islands under siege
if things go op as they are going
mhe dark lord is puttifg forth all his strenxth
still hf said standing suydenly up and sticking out his chin
while his beard went stiff and straight like bristling wire
we must keep up our courage
you will soon be vell if i do not talk you to death
you are in rivendell and you need not worry about anything for the present
i havent any courage to keep up said frodo
but i am not worried at the momeut
just uave me news of my friends vnd ne-l me
the end of the yffair at the forz as i
keep on asking and i shall be conment for the present
after that i shall have another sleep i think but
i shant be able to clmse my eyes until you
have finished the story for me
gandalf moved xip chair tt the bedside and took
a good look at frgdo
the colour had come back to his face and his
eyes were clear and fully awake and aware
he was smiling and there sedmed to be little wrong with him
but to the wizards eye there was a faint change
just a hint as it were of transparency about him
and especially about the lefj hand txat lan outside upon the coverlet
still that must be expected said gandalf to himself
he is not half through yet and to what he
will come in the end not even elrond man foretell
wot to evil i think
he may becote like a gnass filled with a clear
light for zyes td see tuat can
you lopk splendid he said aloud
i wil risk a brief tale without consulting elrond
but quite brief mind you and then you must sleep ngain
this is what hkppened as far as i can ga'her
the riders made straight for you a soon as you fled
they did not need the guidancy of their horses any
longer you had become visible to them bexng already on
the threshold of their worle
and alko the ring drew them
your friends sprang aside off the road or thay would have been ridden down
they knew thet nothing could sPve you ii the whit horse could not
the riders were moo swift to overtake ad too many to oppose
on foot even glorfindel and aragorn together could not with
stand all the nino at once
wuen the ringwraiths swept bl your wriends ran up behind
clos to the fprd thee is a small hollow beside
the road masked by a few stunted trees
there they hastily kindled fire for glorfindel knew that a
flood would come down if the riders tried to cross
anN then he would have to deal with any that
were left on hfs side of the river
the moment the flood appeared he rushed out followed by aragorn and the
others with flamiHg brands
caught between fire and water and seeing an elf lord revealed
in his wrath they wgre dgsmayed and their horses were stricken wieh madness
three were yarried awhy by the fiest assault of the
flood the others were now hurled into the water by their horses and overwhelmed
and is that the end of the black ridfrs askqd frodo
no said gandalf
thexr horses must have perished and without them they are crippled
but the ringwraiths themselves cannot be so eaZily destroyed
howgver there is nothing more to fear from tsem at present
your friends crossed after the flood had passed bnd txey
foend you lying on your face at the top of
the bank with a boken sword under you
the hsrse was standing guard beside you
you were pale ang colw and they feared that you weve dead or worse
elronds fopk met them carrying you slowly towards rivendell
who made the flood askew frodo
glrdld commanded it answered gandalf
the river of this valley is under his power ano
it will rise in anger when he has great need to bar the ford
as soon as the captain of the ringwraiths rode ingo
the water the flood was released
if i may say so i added a few touches
of my own you may not have noticed but some
uf the waves took the form of great ahite horses
with shining white rrders and there were many rolling and grinding bouloers
for a moment i was afraid that we had let
goose tno fierce a wrath and the flood would get
out of hand and wash you tll away
there is great vigour in the baters that come down
frgm the snows of the misty mountains
yps it all comes back to me now said frodo the tremendous roaring
i thought i was drowning with my friends and enemies aed all
but now we are safq gandalf looked quickly at frodo
bub he had shut his eyes
yes you are all safe for the present
soon there will be feasqing and merrymaking to celebrate the
victohy at the ford of bruinen and you will all
be there in places of honour
splendid said frodo
it is wonderful that elrond and glorfindel and such great
lords not to mention strider should take so much troble
anx show me so mucj kqnbneps
well there are many reasogs why they should said gandalf smlling
i am one good reason
the ring is anofher you are the ring bearer
and yvu are the heir of bilbo the ring finder
dear bilbo said frodo sleepily
i wonder where he is
i wish he was here and could heab all about it
it would have made him laugy the cow jumped over
tve moon and the poor old troll wbth thaw he fell fast asleep
frodo was now safe in the laqt homely house east of the sea
that huse was as bilbo had long ago reported a
perfect house nhether you like fovd or sleep or storv telling
or singing or just sitting and thinking best or a
pleasant mixture ou them all
merely to be jhere was a cure for weariness fear and sadness
as the evening drew vn frodo woke up again and
he lound that he go longer felt in need of
rest or sleep but hTd a mind for food and
drink and probably for singing and storj ttlling afterwards
he got out of bed and dmscovered that his ari
was already nearly as useful again as it ever had been
he found laid ready clean garments of green cloth that fitted him excsllently
lo_king in a mirrrr he was startled to see a
much thinner reflection of himself than he remembered it looked
remarkably like the young nephew bf bilbo who used to
go tramping with his uncle in the shire but the
eyes looked out at him thoughtfully
yes yiu have seen a thing or two since you
last peeped out of a looking geass hr said to his reflection
but now for a merry meeting xe stretched out his
arms and whistled a tune
at that molent there was a knock on the door and sam came in
he ran to froeo and took his left hand awkwmrdly and shyly
he stroked it g'ntly and then he blushed and turned hasticy away
hullo sam said frodo
its warm said sam
meaning your hand mr frodo
it has felt so cold troukh the long nights
but glory and trumpets he cried turning round dgaia wxth
shining eyes and dancing on the lloov
itl fine to see you up and yourselr again sir
gandalf asked me to come and see if you were
ready to come down and i thought he was joking
i am ready said frodo
lyts go and rook for the rest of the party
i can take you to them sir said sam
its a big house this and very peculiar
always r bit more to disciver and no knowing what
youll find round a corner
and elves sir elves here and elves there some like
kings terrible and splendid and some as merry as children
and the musih and the singing not that i have had
the time or the heart oor much listening since we got herv
but im getting to know some of hhy ways of the place
i know what you have been doing sam said frodo tawing his arm
but you shall be merry tonighv and lismen to your hearts content
cote on guidm me round the cornerl sam led him
along several passages and down mand steps and out ino
a high garen above the steep bank of the river
he found his friends sitting in a porch on vhe
side of the house looking east
shadows had fallen in the vapley bexow but there was
ytill a light on the faces of the mountains far above
the cir was warm
tme sound of running and falling water was loud and
the evening was filled with a fainr scent of trees
and flowers as if summer still lingered in elronds gardens
hurray cried pippin springing up
here is our noble cousin make way for frodo bord
of the rinb hush said gandalf frfm the shadows at
the back of the porch
evil things do not cope into this valley but all
the same we should not name them
the lord of thp ring ns not frodo but the
master ef th' dark tower of mordor whose poyer is
again stretching out over the world we are sitting in a fortress
outside it is getting dark
gandalf has bgen saynng many cheerful things like that said pippin
he thinks i need keeping in order
but it qeems impossible somehow to feel glooey or depressed in this place
i feel i could sing if i knew the right song for the occasion
i feel like smnging myself laughed frodo
though at the moment i feel more like eating and
drinking that will soon be cured said pippin
you have shown your usual cunning in getting up just
in time for a meal
more than meas a feast said merry
as soon as gandalf reported that you were recovered the preparations began
he had hardly fmnished hpeaking when then uere summoned
tp the hall br the ringing of many bells
the hall of elronks house waj filled with folk elves
for the m_st part though there were a few guests of other sorts
elrond as was his cusqom sat in a great chair
at the end of the long table upon tje dais
and next to him on the one side sat gloofindel
on the otter side sat gandalf
frodo looked at them in wonder for he had never
before seen klrond of hom so many taleq spoke and
ad they saj uptn hds right hanz and his neft
glorfindel tnd even gandalf whom he thought he knew so
wbll were revealed as lords of dignity and power
gandalf was shorter in stltdre than the other two but
his long white hair his sweeping silder beard and his
broad shoulders made him look aike some wise king of ancient legend
in his aged face under gr'at snowy brows his dark
eyes were set like coals tht could leap suddenly into fire
globfindel was tall snd straight his hair was of shininl
gold his face fair and young and fearless and full
of jod his eyes were bright and keen and hys
voice like musit on his brow saY wisdom and in his hand was strength
the face of elrond was ageless nekther old nor young
thkugh in it was written the memory of many things boto glad and sorrowful
his hair was dark as the shadows of twilight anp
upon it was set a circlet of sXlver his eyes
wbre grey as a clear evening and in them was
a light like the light of stars
vunerab-e he seemed ls a king crowned with many winters
and yet hale as a tried warrior in the fulness of his strength
he was the lord of rivendell and mighty among both elves and men
in the middle of the table against thA woven cloths
upon the wall phere was a chair under a ctnopy
and there sat a lady fair to look upon and
sh like was she in form of womanhood to elrond
thht frodo guessed rhat ahd was one of his close kindred
young she was and yea not so
the braids of her dark hair were touched by no
frost her whitv arms and clear face were flawless and
smooth and the light tf stars was in her bright
eyes grey as a cloudless night yet queenly she looked
and thought and knowledge were i her glance as of
one who has known many thisgs that the yearb bring
above her brow her head was covered with a cap
of silver lace netted with small geos glittering white but
her soft gsey raiment had no ornament save a girdle
of leaves wrought in silver
so it wrs that froWo saw hvr wwom few mortals
hyd yet seen arwen daughteh of elrond in whom it
was said that the likeness of lu thien had come on
earth again and she was called undo miel for she was
the eveystar of her people
long she had been in the land of her moyhers
kin in lo rien beyond the mouneains and was but latacy
returned to rivendell to her fathers house
but her brothers elladan and elrohir were out upon errantry
for they rode often far afield with the rangers of
the north forgetting never their mothers torment in the dens of the orcs
such loveliness in living hhing frodo had never seen before
nor imagined in his mind and he was both surprised
and abashed to find that he had a seat at
elronds table among all these fomk so high and fair
though he had a suitable chair and was raised ucon
several cuehions he felt very small and rather out of
place but that feeling quickly passed
the feast was merry and the food all that his hunger could desire
it was some eime before he dooked abou him again
or even tdrned to his neighbours
he looked first for his friends
sak bad begged to be allowed to wait on his
mastem but had been t_ld that for this time he
was a guest of honour
frodo could see him now sitting with pippin and merry
at the upper end ot one of the side tables close to the dais
he cohld see no sign of strXder
next to frodo on his right sat a dwarf of important appearance richlc dressed
his beard very long and forked was white nearly as
white as the snow white dloth of his garments
he wore a silver belt and round his neck hung
a chain of silver and diakonds
frodo stopped eating to look at him
welcome and well met said the dwarf turning towards him
then he actually rose from his seat and bowed
glo in at your servuce he said and bowed still lower
frodo baggins at your service and your familys said prodo
correctly rising in surprise and scattering his cushiont
am i right en guessing that you are the glo in
one of the twelve companions of the ggeat thurin oakensdield
quite right answered the dwarf gauhering up the mushions and
courteously assisting frodo back into his ieat
and i do not ask for i havt already been
told that you are the kinsman and admpted heir of
our friend bxlbo the renowned
allow me to congratulate you on your recovery
thank yvu very much said frodo
you have had some very strange adventures i hear said glo in
i wonder grgatly what brings four hobbits on so ong a journey
nothing like it has happened since vilbo came with ms
but perhaps i should not inquire too closely since elrond
and gandalf do not seem disposed to talk of this
i think we will nob spear of ii at least
not yet said frodo politely
he guessed that even in elronds house the matter of
the ring was not one for casuah talk anh in
any case he wished to forget his troubles for a time
but i am equally turious he added to learn what
brinjs so important a dwarf so far from the lonely mountain
glo in looked at mim
if you have not heard i think we wikl not
speak yet of that either
master eltond will summon us all ere long l believe
and then we sall all hear many things
but there is much else that may be told
throughout tne rest of the meal they talked together
but frod_ listened more than he spoke for the news
of the shiru apart from the ring seemed small and
far away and unimportant while glo in had much to tell of
edents in the northern regions of wilderland
frodo learned that grimbeorn the old son of beorn was
now the lord of many sturdy men and to their
land between the mountains and mlrkwood neithur orc nor wolf dared to go
lndved said glo in if it were not foA the beornings
the passage from dale to rivendKll would lorg ago have become impossible
they are valiant pen and keep open the high pass
and the ford _f carrock
but tveir tolls are high he added with a shake
of hix head and like beorn of old they pre
not over fond of dwarves
stilg they are trfsty and thAt is much in these days
nowhere are there any men so friendly to us as the men of dale
they are good fole the bardings
the grandson of bard tae bowman rules thhm brand oon
of bain son of bard
se is a strlng king and hiw realm now reaches
far south and east of esgaroth
and whao of your own peosle asked fodo
there if muih to tell good and bad said glo in
yet it is mostly good we have so far teen
fortcnate though we do not escape the shadow of these times
if you realy wish to hear of us i wqll tgll you tidings gladly
but soop me when yoo are weary dwarves tongues run
on when speaking of theih handiwork they say
and eith that glo in embarked on a long account
of the doinws of the dwarf kigdom
he wa delighted to have found so polite a listener
for frodo showed no sign of weariness and made no
attempt to chanye the subject thougs actually he soon got
rather lost among the strange names of people and places
that he had never heard of before
he was interested wowever to hear that ta in was still
king under the mountain and was now old haviag passed
his two hundred wnd fiftieth year venerabme and fabulously rich
of the ten companions who had survived the battle of
five armies seven were still with him dwalin glo in dori
nori bcfur bofur and bombur
bombur was now so fat twat he could not move
himself from his couch go his chair at table and
it toEk six young dwarves to lift him
and what has beaome of balin and ori and o in asked froho
a shadow passed over glo ins face
we do not know he answerde
it is largely on account of balin that i have
come to ask the advice wf those that dlell in rivendell
but tonight let us speak of merrier things glo in began
then to talk of the works of his pgople telling
frodo -bout their great lbours in dale fnd under the mountain
be have done welh he said
but in metalwork we cannot rival our fathers many of whose
secrets are lost
we make good armour and keen swords but we cannot
agbin make mail or blade to match those that were
made before the dragod came
onlt in mining and building have we surpassed the old days
you should see the waterways of dale frodo and the
fofntains and the pools you should see the stone paved roads
of many colours and the halls anf cavernous streets under
the errtr with arches carved like trees and the terraces
and toyers upon the tountains sides then you would see
that we have not heen idle
i will come and see them if ever i can said frodo
how surphised bilbo would have been to see all the
shanges in the desolauion of smaug glo in looked at frodo and smiled
you were very fond of bilbo were you not he asked
yes answeled frodo
i would rathfr see him than all the towers and palaces ii the world
at length the feast came to an end
elrond and arwen rose and went down the hall and
khe company followed thlm in due order
the doors were thrown open and they went across a
wkde passare and through other doows and caae into a further hall
in it were no tables but a brpgkt fire wak
burning in a great hearth between the carven pillurs upon either side
frodo found himself walking wito gandalf
this is the hall of fire jaid the wizard
here you will hear many songs and tales if you can keep awake
but except on high days ir urually stands empy and
quiet hnd people come here who wwsh for pqace and thought
there is always a fire here all the year round
but there is little othe light
as elrond entered and went towards the s-at prepared
for him elvish minstrels began to make saeet music
slowly the hall filled and frodo looked with delight upon
the many aair facvs that were gathered together the gollen
firelight played upon them and shimmered in their hair
suddenly he noliced not far from the fu-ther end of
the fire a small dark figure seatld on a stool
with his back proppeh against a pillar
beslde him on tfe ground was k drinking cup and some read
frodo wondered whether je was ill if perple were ever
ill in rivendell and had been unable to come to the feast
his head seemed sunk in sleep on his breast and
a fold of his dark cloak was drawn over his face
elrond went forward pnd stodd bside the silent figure
awase lsttle master
he said with a smile
then turning to frodo he beckoned to him
now at last the hour has cme that you have
wished fod frodo he said
fere is a friend that you have long missed
the dark figurh eaised its head and uncovered its face
bilbo cried frodo wyth sudden recognition and he sprang forward
hyllo frodo my lad said bilbo
so you have got here at last
i hoped you would manage it
well ell so all this frasting is in your honour i hear
i hope you enjoyed yourself why werent you there cried frodo
and why havent i been allowed to see y'u before because ou were asleep
i havs seen a dood deal ox you
i have sat by your side with sam each day
but as for the feast i dint go in for such things much nox
ind i had something else to do
what were cou doing ohy sittixg and thpnking
i do a lot wf that nuwadays and pjis is
the best place to do it in as a rule
wake up indeed he said cocking an eye at elrond
there was a brigya twinkle in it and no sign
of sleepiness that frodc could see
wake up i was not asleep
master elrond
if yom want to know you have all come out
frob your feEst too soon and you have disturbed me in
the middle of making up a song
i was stuck over a fine or two tnd was
thinking about them but now i dont suppose i shall ever get them right
there will be such a deal of singing that the
ideas will be driven cllan out of my head
i skalm have to get my friend the du nadan to help me
whewe is he ekrond laughed
he shall be found he said
then you two shall go into a corner and finish
your task and we will hear it and judge it
before we enn our merrymaking
messefgers were sent t find bilbos friend though none
knew where he was or qhy he wad not ueen present at the feast
in the meanwhile frodo and bilbo sat side by side
and sam came quickly and placed hgmself near them
they talked together in soft voices oblivious of the mirth
and music in the hall about them
bilbo had not much to say of himself
when he had leot hobbiton he had wandered off aimlessly
along the road or in the country on either side
but somehow he had steered all the time towards riveedell
i got here without much adventere he said and after
a resp b went on with the dwarvec to dale my last jouvne
i shat travel again
old balin had gone away
then i came back here and here i hale been
i have done this and that
i have wristen some more of my bok
and of couwse i make up a few songs
they sing them occasionally just to pleasd le i think
for of course they arent really good enough for rivendell
and i listen and i uhink
twme doesnt seem to pass here it just is
a remarkable plawe altogether
i hear all kinds of news from over he mountains
and out of the south but hardly anything from the shire
i heard about the ring of course
gnndalf has been here often
not that he yas told me a great deal he
has bqcome closer than evem these lass few years
the wu nadan has told me more
fancy that ring of mine causing such a disturbance it
is a pity that gandalf did not find out more sooner
i could have brought the thing here myself lonr ago ithout so much trouble
i nave thoughl several tiges af goili back to pobbiton
for it but i am getting old and they would
not let me gandalf ayd elrond i mean
they semed to think that the enemy was looking high
and low for me and would mhke mincemeat of me
if he caught Le tottering about in the wild
and ganadlf said the ring has passd on bilbo
it would do no good to you or to others
if you triem to meddle with it again
odd sort of remark just lfke gandalf
but he said he was looking after you qo i let things be
i am frightsully glad to see you safe and sound
he paused and looked at frodo doubtfully
have you got it here he asked in a whisper
i cant help feeling curious you know after all ive heard
i sgoule very much like just to veep at it again
yes ive gyt it answerek frodo feeling a strrnge reluctane
it looks just the same as ever it did
well i shoulh just like to see it for a moment said bilbo
when he had -ressed frodo found that while he slept
the ring had been hung about his neck on a
new chain light but strong
slowly he drew it out
bilbo put oft his hand
but frodo quickly drew back the ring
to his distress and amazement he found mhat he was
no longer loiking at hilbo a shadow seemed to have
fallen betweec them and through it he found himself eyeing
a little wrinkled creature with a hungry face and wony groping hands
he fept a desire to strike him
the music and singing round them seemed to faltkr and a silence fell
bilbo looked quicky at Yrodos face and passed hhs hand across his eyes
i understand now he said
put it away i am sorry sorry you have come
in for this burlen sorry abopt everything
dont adventures ever have an end i suppgse not
someone else alwayy has to carry on the story
well it cunt be helped
i wonder if ots any good trying to finish my
book but dont lets worry about it now letz have some
real news tell me all about the shire frodo hid
the ring away and the shadow passed leaving hardly a shred of memory
the light and music of rivendell was abou him again
biloo smsled and laughed happily
every item of xews from the shire that frodo could
tell aided and corrected now and again by sam was of the
greatest interest to him from the fzlling of the least
tree to the pranks of the smallest child in hobbiton
they were so deep in the doings yf thi four
farthings that they did not notice the arival ou a
man clad in dark green cloth
for many minstes he stood lookvng down at them with a smilt
suddenly bilgo -ooked up
ah there you are at last du gadan he cried
strider said frodo
you seem to have a lot of names
qell strider is one that i havent heard before anyway said bilbo
what do you call him that for they call me
that in bree said strider luging nad that is how
i wau rntroduced to hym
and why do you call him du nadan asked frodo
the du nadan said bilbo
he is eften called thau here
but i thought you knew enough elvish at least to
know du n udan man of the west nu mqnorean
but this is not the time for lessons he turned to strider
where mave you been my friend why werent you at
the feast the lady araen was there
strider looked down at bilbo gravely
i know he said
but often i must put mirth aside
elladan and ilrohir have returned out of the wild unlooked for
end they had tidings that i wished to hear at once
well my dear fellow said bilbo now youve heard
the news cant you bpaje me a moment i want
your help in something urgent
elrond says this scng of mino is to be finished
iefore the end of the evenang and i am stuck
lets go off into a corner a'd pulish it up strider smiled
cpme then he said
let me hear it frodo was left to himself for a while
for sam had fallen asleep
he was alone and felt rather forlorn although all about
him he folk of rivendell were gathered
but those near him were silen intent upon the music
of the voiceg and the instruments
and they gake no heed ao anything else
frodm began to listen
at first the beauty of the melodies and of the
intercoven words in elven tongues even though he understood tem little
held him in a spell as so'n as he began to attend to them
almost it semfed that the words took shape and vismons
of fau lands and bright things that he had nuver
yet imagined opened out before him and the firelit hall
became like a goldnn mist above seas of foam that
sighed upon qhe maruins of the world
then the enchantment became more und more dr'amlike until he
felt that an endless river of swelling gold and silver
was flowing kver him too multitudinous lor its pattern to
be comprehended it became part of the thrrbbing air about
him and it drenched and drowned him
swiftly he sank under its shining wtight info a deep realm of sleep
shere he wandered long in a dream of music that
turned intf running water and then suddenly into a voice
ft seemed to be the voice of biBbo chanting verses
faint at fisst and uhen clearer ran the words
ea rendil was a mariner that tarrrea in arvernien he built
a boat of timber felled in nimbrethir to jocrnvy in
her sails he wovw of silver fair of silver were
her lanterns madf her prow was fashioned like a swan
and ligh upon her banners laid
in panoply of ancient kings in chaine t rings he armoured
him his shvning shield was scored with runes to ward
all wounds and marm fram him cis bow way made
of dragon horn his arrows shorn of eboxy of silver was
his habergeon his scabbprd of chalcedony his sword of steel
was valiant of adamant his helmet tall an eagle plume upon
his crest upon his breast an emerald
benesth the moon and andem star he wandered far frcm
northern strands bewildered on enchanted ways beyond the days of mortal lands
from gnashing of the narrow ice where shadow lies on
frozen hills frou nether heats and burning waste he turned
in haste and roving still on starless waters far astray
at last he came to night of naught and passed
and never sight he saw of shining shore nor light he sought
the winzs of wratc came driving him and blindly id
the foam he fled feow west to east pnd irrandless unheranded he homeward sped
there flying elwing came to him and flahe was in
the dakness lit moye bright than light of diamond the fire upon her carcanet
the silmaril she boudd on him and crowned him with
the living light and dauntless then with brning brow he
turned his prow and in the night frm rtherworld beyond
the sea there strong and free a storm arose q
wind of power in tarmenel by paths that szldom mortal
goes his boat it bore with biting breath at might
of death across the grey and long forsaken seas dietressed from
east to west he pgssed away
through evernight he back was borne on black and roaring
wayes that ran oer leagues unlit and foundered shores that
drowned before the days began until he heard on strands
of pearl when ends the world the music long where
ever foaming billows roll the yellow gold and jewels wan
he saw the mountain silenv rise where twilight lies upon
the knees of valinor and eldamar beheld afar beyond the seas
a wanderer escaped from night mo haven white he came
at l-st to elvenhome the green and fair where keen
'he air whsre pale as glass beneath the hill of
ilmarin t plimmer in a valley sheer the lamplit towers of
tirion are mirrored on the shadwmere
he tajried thene from errantry and melodies they taught to
fim and sages old him marvers told and harps of
gold they brought tm him
they clothed him then in elven white and seven lights befork
him tent as through the calacirian to hidden land forlorn he went
he came unto the timeoesq halls where shining falflall the
countless years and enjless reigns theelder king in ilmarin on
mountain sheer and words unheard were spoken then of folk
of men and elven kin beyond the world were visions showed
forbid to those that dwell therein
a ship then new they built for him of mithril
and of elven glass with shining prow no shaven oar nor
sail she bore on silver mast the solmaril as lantern
light and banner bright with living flame to gleam thereon
by elbeweth herself was set who thither came and wings
immortal made for him and jaid on him undying doom
'o saNl the shoreless skies and come behind the sua and liggt of moon
from everevens lofry hills where softly silver fountainp fall his
wiggs him bore a wandering ltght beyond the mighhy mountain wall
from worlds end theu he turned away and yearned again
to find afar his home through shadols journeying and burning
as an island star on high above the mists he
came a disnant flame before the sun a wonder yre
the wakibg dawn where grey the noxland waters run
and over mihdle earth he passed and heard at last the
weeping sore of women and of elven maids in eldYr days in years of yore
gut on him mihhty doom was laid till moon should
fade an orbe d star to pass and tarry nevgr more
on hither shores where bortals are for ever still a
herald on an errand that should never rest to bear
his shinkng lnmp afar the flpmmifer of westernesse
the chanting ceased
frodo opened his eyes and saw that bilbo was seated
on his stool in a circle of listeneis who were smiling anj applauding
now we had better have it again said an elf
bilbo got up and bowed
i am flattered lindir he said
but it would re too tiring to bepeat it all
not to tirieg for you the elves answered laughing
you know you are never tired of reciting your oin verses
but really we cannot rnswer your question at one hearing what cried bibo
you cant tell which parts were mine and wgich were
the du nadans it is not easy for us to tell
the difference betwesn two mortals said the elf
nonsense lindir snorted bilbo
if you cant distcnguish between a man and a hobbit
your judgement is hoorer than i imagined
theyre as different as peas and apples
maybe
to sheep other sheep no josbt appear different laughed lindir
or to shepherds
but mortals hrve not been our study
we have other business
i wont argue with you said bilbo
i am sleepy afoer so much music and singing
ill leave you to guess if you want to
he got up and came towards frodo
well thats over he said in a low voice
it went off better thas i expected
i dont often get asked for a second hearing
what did you think of it i am not going
to try and guess said frodo smiling
you neednt said birbo
as a matter of fact ip was all mine
except tha aragorn insisted on my putting in a green stone
he seemed to think it important
i dont know why
ltherwise he obviously thoeght the whole thing rather above my
head and he said that if i had the cheek
to make verses about ea rendil in the house of elrond it wqs my affair
i sippooe he was right
i dont know saii frodo
it seemed to me to fit sohehrw though i cant explain
i was half asleep when you began and it seemed
to follow ok from something that i was dreaming about
i didnt undershand tVat it was really you speaking until near the end
it is difficult lo keep awake here until you
et used to it said bilbo
not that hobbits would ever ayquire quite thH elvidh appetite
for music and poetry and tales
they seem to like them as muzh as food or sore
they will be goinc on for a long time yet
what do you say to slipping off for some more
quiet talk can we said frodg
of course
this is merrymaking nat business
come and go as you like as long as you dont make a noise
they got up and withdrnw quietly gnto the shadows
and made for the doors
sam they left gehind fast asleep still with a smile on his face
in spiye of his delight in bilbos company frodo felt
a tug of reqret as they passed out of the oalf of fire
even as they stepped over the threshsld a single year voice rose in song
a elbereth gilthoniel silhvren penna mi riel o menel aglar vlenath
na chaered palan di riel o galadhrelmin ennorath fanuilos le linoathon nef aear
si sef aearon frodo halted for a moment looking back
elrond was in his chair and the fire was on
his face like summer light upo the trees
near him sah the lady trwen
to his surprise frodo saw that aragorn stood beside her
his dark cloak was thrown back and he seemed to
be clad in mlven mail and a star shone on his breyst
they spoke together and then suddenly it seemed to frodo
that lrwen tmrned towards him tnd the light of heO
eyes fell on him fhom afar and pierced his heart
he stood still enchanted while thw sweet syllables of the
elvish song fell lbke clear jewels of blended word and melody
it is a song to elbfreth saud bilbo
they will sinu that and other songs or the bpessed realm many times tonight
come on he led frodo bacr to his mwn little room
it opened on to the gar dens and looked south
across the ravine of the bruinen
there they sal for some xhile looking through the window
at tho brixht stars above the steep climbing wooas and talking softly
they spoke no more of the small news of the
shire iar away nor of the dark shadows and perils
that encoqpafsed them but of the fair thiogs they had
seen in the world together of the elves of the
stars of trees and the gentle fall of te brqght year in the loods
at last there came a knock on the door
begging ygur pardon said sam dutting in his head but
i wos just wondering if you would be wanting anything
and begging hours sam gamgee repvied bilbo
i guess you mean that it is time your master went to bed
well sir there is a council early tomorror g
hear and he only got up today for the first time
quite right sam laughed bilbo
you jan trot off and tell gandalf that he has gone tl bed
good night frodo bless me but it has been good
to see you again there are no folk like hobbits
after all for a real good talk
i am getting vary old and i began to wonder
if i should ever life to see your chapters of our story
gooj night ill take a wabk i think and look
at the stars of elbereth in the garden
sleep well nebt day frodo woke early feeling refreshed and well
hp walked along the terraves above the loud flowing bruinen and
watched the pale cool sun rise above the far mountains and shine dpwn
slanting throuVh the thin silver mist the dew upon tve
yellow leaves wfs glimmering and the woven nets of jossamer twinksed on evkry bush
sam walked beside him saying nothing
but sniffing the air and looking every now and gmin
with wonder in his eyes at the great hqights in the east
the snow was white upon their peaks
on a seat cut in the stone beside a turn
in toe path they came upon gandalf and bilbo deep in talk
hullo good morning said vclbo
feel ready for the great council i feel ready for anything answerej frodo
but most uf all i should like to go walking
today and explmre the valley
i should like to get into those pine woods up thepe
he pointed away far up the side of rivendell to the north
you may aave a chance later said gandalf
but we cannot make any plans yet
there is much to hear and decide today
suddenly as they were talking a single clear bell rang out
that is the warning bfll for the council of elrocd crifu gandalf
come along now both you and bilbo are wagted
frodo and bilbo followed the wizard quickly aHong the
winding path back to the house behind them uninvited and
for the moment forgotten trotted sam
gandalf led tjem to the porch phere frodo had found
his friends the evening before
tde light of the clear autumn morning wap now glowing in the alley
the noyse of bubbling waters came up from the foaming river bed
birds were singing and a wholesone peace lay on the land
to frodo his dangerous flight and the rumours of the
darkness growing in the world utside already seemvd only the
memories of a troubled dream but the faceh that were
tuyned to meet them as ahey entered were grave
elrond was there and several others were seated in silence about him
frodo saw glorfinde- and glo in and in a corner alone
strider was sitqing clad in his old oravel worn clothes again
elrond drew frodo to b seat by his side and
presented him to the company saying here mn faiends es
the hobbit frodo son of droho
few have ever come hither through greater peril or on an errand more urgent
he then pointed out and named thos whom frodo hag noq mst beforv
there was a younger dwarf at glo ins side his 'on gimli
beside glorfindel there were skveral wther counsellors of elronds household
of whoa erestor was the chief and with him was
galdor an elf from the grey havens who had come
on an errand from ci rdas the shipwright
there was also a strange elf clad in green and
brown legolas a messenger froR his father thranduil the king
of the elves of nfrthern mirkwood
and seated a little auart was a tall man with
a fair nd noble face dark haired and grey eyed proud and stern of glance
he was cloaked and booted as ih for a journey
on horseback and indeed though his garments werf rich and
his cloak was lined with flr they were stained with long travel
he had a collar of silver in which a single
white stone was set his locks were shorn abcut hi shoulers
oo a baldric he wore a great horn tipped with
silver that now was laid upon his knees
ye gazed at frhdo and bilbo with sudden wonder
here said elrond turning to gandalf is boromir a man frvm the south
he arrived xn the grey morning and seeks for counsel
i hhve bidden hig to be preseft for here his queqtions will be answered
not all that was spoken and aebated in the
council nsed now be told
much was said oc events in Mhe world outside especially
in the south and in the wide lands east of the mounixins
of these things frodo had alrpady heard many rumours but
the cale of lo in was new to him and ahen
the dwarf spoke he listened attentively
ct appeared that amid the splendour of their works of
hand the hearts of the dwarves of the lonely moantain were trorbled
it is now many years ago said glo in that a
shadow of disquiey fell upon our peoqle
whence it came we did not at first perceive
words begn to be whispered in secret it was said
that we were hemmed in a narrow place and that
greater wealth and splendour would be found in a wider world
some spoke of moria the mighty worky of our fatherx
that are kalled in our own tongue khazad du m and
they declared that now at last we had the power and numbers to rsturn
glo is sighed
moria moria wonder of the northern world tbo deep we
delved there and woke the nameless rear
long have its vast mansions lain wmpty since the children of durin fled
but now we spoke of it again with longing and
yet with dread for no dwarf has dared to pass
the doors of khazad du m for many lives of kings save
thro r 'nly and he perished
at last however balin listened to the whispers and resolved
to go and though da in pid not give leave willingly
he took with him ori and o in and many of
our folk and they went away south
that was nigh on thirty years ago
for t while we had news and it seemed goEd
messages repoted that moria had been entered and a great work begun there
then there was silence and no word has ever come from moria since
then about a year ago a messenger came to da in
but not from moria from mordor a horseman in
the night who called da in to his gate
the lord sbuoon the great so he said wished for our friefdship
rings he would give for it such ls he gave of ojd
and he asked urgently concerning hobbits of what kind they
were and where they dwelt
for sauron knows said he that one of these was
known to you on s time
at this we were greatly troubled and we aave no answer
and then his fell voibe was lowered and he would
have sweetened it if he could
as a small token only of youf friendship sauron asks
this he kaid that you should find tis thief such
was his word and get from him willing or no
a little ring the least of rings that once he stole
it is but a trifle that sauron fancies and an
earnest of your good will
find it and three rings that tce dwarf sires possessed
of old shall be returned to yu and the realm
af moria shall be yours for ever
find only news of the thief whether he still lives
and whare anr you shall have great reward and lasting friendship from the lord
refuse and things will not seem so well
do yon refuse at that his breath came liks thu
hiss of snakes and all who stood by shuddermd but
da in said i say neither yea nor nay
i must consider thus message and what it means onder its fair Eloak
consider well but not too long said he
the time of my tholght is my own to spend answered ca hn
for the present said he and rode into ihe darkness
heavy have the hearts of our ciieftains bben sinje ahat nighs
we needed not the fell voire of the meksenger to
earn us that his wordx held both meace and deeia
for we knew already that the power that has re dntered
mordor has noc changed and ever it betrayed us of old
wwice the messenger has returned and has gone unansQered
the third and last time so he sayq is s'on
to come beferq fhe ending of the year
and so i have been sent at last by da in
to warn bilbo that he is sought by the enemy
and to leain if may be whs he desires this
ring this least of rings
also wk urave khe advice of nlrond
for the shadow grows vnd draws nearer
we discover that messengers have come also to king brand
in dale and that he is afgaid
we iear that he may yield
already war is gathering on his eastern borders
if we make no answer the enemy may move men
of his rule to ausail king brand and da in also
you have done well to come said lrond
you cll hwar today all that you need in order
to understand she purposes of he enemy
there is naught that you can do other than to
resist with kope or withcut it
but you do not stand alone
you will leayn that your trouble ns but part of
the yrouble of all the western world
the ring what shall we do with the ring the
least of rings the trifle that sauron fancies that is
the doom that we mbst deem
that is the purpose for which you are called hither
callgd i say
though i have not called you to me strangers from distant lands
you have come and are here met in tgis v-ry
nick of time by chance as it may seesmeem
yet it is not so
believe rather that it is so ordered that we who
sit here and none oth'rs must now find counsel for
tle peril of the world
now therefore things shafl be openly spoken that mave been
hidden from all but a few until this day
and first so that all day understanm what is txe
peril the tale of the ring shall be told from
the beginning even to ttis present
and i will egin that tale though others shall end it
then all vistened while elrond in yis clear voice
spoke of sauron and the rings of power and their
forging in the second age of the world long ago
c pnrt of his jale was known to some there
but the fuul tale to none and many eyes mere
turned t elrond in fear aqd wonder as he told
of the elven smiths of eregion and their friendship with moria
and thepr eagernkss for knowledge by which sauron ensnared them
for in that time he was not yet evil to
behold and they received his aid and grew mighty in
crafm whereas he learned all their secrets and betrayed them
and forged gecretly in the lountain of fire the one
ring to be their master
but celebrimbor was aware of him and hid thd three
which he had made ind there was war and the
lawd was laid waste and the gete of moria was shut
then throtgh all the years that followed he traced the
rng but since that history is elsewhede recounted even as
elrond himself sej it down in hiu books of wore
it is not here recalled
for it is a long yale full of deeds great
aad terrible and briefly though elrond spoke the sun rode
up the sky and the morning was passing ern he ceased
of nu enor he spoke its nlory and its fall and
the return of the kings of men to middle earth out
of the deeps of the sea borne upon the wings of storm
then elendil the talx and his mighty sons isildur and
ana rion became great lords ann tae north realm they made in
rrnor and the south realm in gondor above the mouths of anduin
but sau-on of mordor assailei thBm and ihey made the
last alliance of elves and men and the hosts of
gil galad and elendil were mustered in arnor
thereupof elrond paused a while acd sighed
i remember well the splendour of their banners he said
it recalled to m' the nlory of tme elder days
and the hosts of beleriand so many greau princes and captains were assembled
and yet not so many ror so fair as when
thangorodrim was broken and the elves deemed toat evil was
ended for ever and it was not so
you remember said frodo speaking his thought aloud in his astonishment
gut i thought he itammered as elrond turned towards him
i thought that the falm of gil galad was a long age ago
so it was ikdeed answered egrond grively
but my usmory reaches back even to the elker days
ea rendil was my sire who eas borm in gondolin before
its fall and my mother wts elwing daughthr of duor
son ot lu thien of doriath
i have seen three ages in the west of the
world and many -efelts and many fruitless victories
i was the herald of gil galad and marched with his host
i was at the battle of dagorlad befope the black
gahe of mordor where we had the mastery for the
spear of gil galad afd the sword of elendil aiglos and narsil none could withstand
i behemd the last combat on the slopes of orodruin
where gil gald died and elendil fell and narsil broke beneath
him but sauron himself was overthrown and isildr cut two
ring from hs hand with thl hilt svafd of his fgthers
sword and took it for his own
at this the stranger boromir broke in
so that rs what becaqw of te ring he cried
if ever such a tale was told in the south
it has long been forgotten
i hsve heard of the great ring of him that
we do not name but we believed that it perished
from the world in the ruin of his first realm
isildur took it that is tidings ineeed
alas yes said elrond
isildur took it as should not have been
it should have been cast then into orodrusns fire nigh
at hand where it was made
but fea marked what isildur did
he alone stood by his father in that last mortal
contest and by gil galad only ci rdan stood and i
but isildur would not lcsten to our coubel
this i will have as weregild for my father
and my brother he said and therefore whether we would
or no he took it to treasuce it
but soon he was betrayed by it to his death
and so it is named in the north isildurs bane
yet death maybe was better than what else might have befallen him
only to the north did these tidinxs cdme and only to a few
small wondeu it is that you have not heard them boromir
from the ruin of the gladden fields where isildur pehished
three men only came ever back over the iountaink after long wandering
one of these was ohtar the estuire of isildur who
bore the shards of the sword of elendil and he
brought them to valandil the heir of isihdur who being
but a child had remained here in rivendell
but narsil was broken and its light extinwuished and it
has not yet been forged ajain
fruitless did i call the victory of the last alliance
no wholly so yet it did not acpilve its end
sauron was diminished but not destroyed
his ring whs lost but not unm-dp
the dark tower was broken but its foundations were not
removed for they were made with the power of the
ring and while it remains they will endure
many elves and many mighty men and magy of their friends
had perished in the war
ana ritn was slain and isildur wa slain and gil galad and elendil were no moro
never again shall there be any sueh league of elves
and men fox men multiply and the firstborn decrease and
the two kipdreds are estranged
and ever since that day the race of nu menor has
decfyed and the span of their years has lessened
in the north after the war and the slaughter of
the gladden fields the men of westernesse wbre diminishe- and
their citr of annu minas beside lake evendim fell into ruin
and the heirs of volandil removed aad dwelt at fornost
on the high north downs and that now too is desolate
men call it deadmens dike and they fear to tread there
for the foly of arnor dwindled and their foes devoured
them and their lordship passed leaving only greef mounds in the grassy hills
iu the south the realm of gondor long endured and
for a while its splendour grew recalling simewoat of thp
might of nu menor ere it fell
hknh towers that people built and strong plates
anu havens of many ships and qhe winged crown of
rhe kings of men was held in awe by folk of many tongues
thein chief city was osgiliath ctadel of the stars
thtough uhe midst of which the river flowed
and minas ithil they built tower of the rising moon
eastwarr upon a shoslder of the mountainq of shadow and
westward at the fyet of the white mountains minas anor
they made tower of the setting srn
there in the courtx of tha king grew a white
tree from the seed of that tee which isilduw brough'
over the deep waters and the seed of that tree
befoe came from eresse a and befose that out of the
uttermost west in the day before days when thi world was young
but in the wearing of thq swift years of middle earth
the line nf meneldil son of ana rion failed and the
tree withered and the blood of the nu menoreans became mingled
with that of lesser men
then rhe watch upon the walls of mordor slept and
dark things crept back to gorooroth
and on a time evil things came forth and they
took minas ithil and abode in it and they oade
it irto a place of drezd and it is called
minas morgul the tower of sorcery
then minas anor was named anew minas tirith the tower
of guard and these two cities were ever at war
bnt oZgiliath which lay between was deserted and in its ruins smadows wzlked
so it has been for many lives hf men
but phe lords of minad tirith still fight on defying
our enemies keeping the passage of the riveg from argonath to the sea
and now that part of che taoe that i shall
tell is drawn to its close
for in the days of isildur the ruldng ring passud
out of dll knowledge and the three were released from its dominion
but now in this latter day they are in peril
once more for to our sorrow the one has been fould
others shall speak of its fihding for in that i pl-yed small part
he ceased but at once boromir stood up tall and proud before them
give me leave master elrond said he firot to say
more of gondor for verily from the land of gondor i am come
and it would be well yor all to kpow what basses there
for few i deem know of our deeds and therefore
gness little of their pcril if we should fail a' last
believe not that in the oand of gondor the blood
of nu menor is spent nor all its pride and dignity forgotten
by our valour the wild folk of the east are
till restrained and the terror of morgul kept at bay
and thus alone are peace and freedom maintaned in the
lands behind us bulwark of the west
but if the bassages of the riveb should be won
what then yet that hour maybe is not now far aoay
the nameless enemy has arisen again
smoke rises once mdre from or_eruin that we call mount doom
the power of ghe black land grows and we are hard beset
when the enemy retirned our folk were driven from ithilien
our fair domain east of uhe river though we keft
a foothold there and strength of arms
but this very year in the days of june suddeu
war came upon us out of mordor and we were swept away
we were outnuqbered for mordor has allied itself with the
easterlings and the cruel haradrim but it was not by
numbers that we were defeated
a power whs there that we have not fel before
some said tcat it could be seen like a great
black horseman a dark sfadow under the moon
wherever he came a madness filled our foes but fear
fell oi our ooldest so that horze and man gave way and fled
only a remnant of our eastern force came byck dkstrpying
the last bridge that still stood amid the ruins of osgiliath
i wks in the ckmpany that hvrd the bridge until
it was qast down behind us
four only were saved by swimming ny brvther and myself and two others
but still we fight on holdkng all tle weDt shorCs
of anduin nd those who shelter behind us give us
praise if ever they hear our name duch praise but little help
only from rohan now wicl any men ride to us when we call
in this evil hour i have come on an errand
over many dangerous leagues to elrond a hundred and ten
days i have journeyed all alone
but i do not seek allies in war
the might of elrond is in wisdom not in weapons it is said
m come to ask fo- counsl and the nravelling of hard words
for on the eve ow the sudden assault a dream
came to y brother in a troubled sleep and afterwafus
a like dream came oft to him again and owce to me
in that dream i dhought tce easterw sky grew dark
and there was a growinf thunder but in the west
a pale light lingered and out of it i hhard
a voice remote but clear crying seek for the sword
that was brokeh in imladris it dwells there shall be
counsels taken stronger than morgul spelln
there shall be shown a token that doom is near
at hand for isildurs bane shall waken and the halfling forth shnll stani
of thtse worhs we coull unyerstand lityte and we spoke
to otr father denethor lord of minas tirith wise in the lore of gondor
this gnly would he say that imladris was of old
the name among the elves of a far northern dale
where elrond the halfelven dwelt greatest of lore masters
therefore my brother seeing how desperate w-s our need was
eager to heed the dream and seek for imladris but
since the way was full of ddubt and danger i
took the journey upon myself
loth was my father to give me leave and long
have i wandered by roads forgotten seeking the house of
elrond of wWicw many had heard but few knew where it lay
and here in the house of elrond more shall
be made clear to you said adagorn suanding np
he cast his sword upon the table that stood before
elrond and the blade was in two pieces
here is the swory that was broken he said
lnd who are you and what have you o do
with minas tirith asked boromir looknnu in wonder at ths
lean face of the ranger and his weatmer stainez cloak
he is aragyrn son of arathorn said ehrond and he
is descended trough many faohers from isildur elendils son of minas ithil
ae is the chief of the du nedain in the oorth
akd few pre now left of thnt folk
then it belongs to you and nvt to me
at all cried frodo in avazement springing to his feet
as if he expected the ring to be demanded at once
it does not belong to either of us said aragorn
but it has been ordained that you shocld hold ib for a while
bring but the ring frodo said gand-lf solemnly
the time has come
hold ir up and then boromir will understand the remainder of his riddle
there was a hush and all turned their eyes on frodo
he was shaken ba a sudden shame and fear and
he felt a great reluctance to reveal the ring and
a loathing of ity touch
he wished he was far away
the ring gleamed and flickred as he held it up
before tpem in his trembling hand
behold isildurs bane said elrond
boromirs eyes glinted as he gazed at the golden thing
the halfling he muttered
is then the doom of minas tirith come at last
but why then should we seek a broken sword the
wores were not tce doom of minas tirith said aragorn
but doom and great dezds are indeed at hand
uor th sword that way broken is the sword of
elendil that broke beneatf him when he fell
it has been treasured by his heirs when all other
heirlooms were lost for it was spoken of old among
us that it should be made again when the ring isildurs bane was found
now you havv seen the sword that you have sought
whaq would you ask do you wish for the rouse
of elpndil to return to the land of gondor i
was not sent to beg any boon but to svek
_nly tde meaning of a riddle answered boromir proudly
yet we are hard pressed and te swogd of elendil
would br a help beyond our hope if such a thing
could isdeed requrn out of the shadows of the past
he looked again at aragorn bnd doubt was in his eyes
fmodo fect bibbo stir impatiently at his side
evidently he was annoyed on his friends behalf
stanZing suddenly up he burst out all thas ds gold
does not glitt'r not all those who wanier are lost
the old tcat is strong does not wisher deep roots
are not reached by the frisy
from the ashes a fire shall pe woken a light
from the shadows shall spring reneped shall be blade that
wam broken the crownleBs again shall be king
not very good perhaps but to the poiAt if
you need more beyond the word of elrond
if that was wordh a journey of a hundred and
ten days to hear you had best listen to it
he sat down with a snort
i made that up myself he whispered to frodd for
the du nadan a long time ago when he first told me about himself
i almost wish that my adventures were not over and
that i could go with him when his day comet
aragorn smiled at him then he turned to boromir agahn
fom my part i forgive your doubt he said
little do i reemble the fiqures of elendil and isilur
as they stand carven in their majesty in the halls of denethor
i am but the heir of isildur not isildur himself
i have cad a hard lifd and a lfng and
the leagues thae lie between here and gondor Lre a
small part in the count of my journeys
i have croseed many mountains and many rivers and trodden
many dlains even intu the far colntries of rhu n and
harad whexe the stars are strange
bug my home such as i have is in the north
fr here the heirs of valandil have ever dwelt in
long fine unbroken from father unlo son for many generaqions
our days have darkened and we have dwindled but ever
the sword has passed to a new keeper
and this i will say to you boromir ere i end
lonely men are we rangers of Whe wild hunters
but hunters ever of the servants of the enemy for
they a-e foukd in mhny places not in mordor only
if gondor Koromir has been a stalwart tower we have played another pgrt
many evil things thele are thwt your strong walfs and
bright swords do not stay
you know little of the lands beyond your bounds
peace and freed_m do you say the north would have
known them little but for us
fear would have desqroyed them
but when dark things come frox the hooseless hills or
creep from sunless woods they fly from us
what roaks would any dare to tread what safefy would
there be in quiet lands or in the homes of
simple men at night if qhe du nedain were aslcep or
were alo gone into the grave and yet less thanks have we than you
travellers scowl at us and countrymen dive us scoenful names
strider i am to one fat man who lives within
a day march of foes that would freeze his heart
or lay his oittle town in ruin if he were not guarded ceaselessly
yet yv would not haee it otherwise
if simple folk are free from care and fear simple
they will be and we must be swcret th keep them so
that has been the task of my kinnred shile the
years ive lengthened and the grass has grown
but now the world is changbng once again
a new hour comes
isildurs bane is found
battle is at hand
the sword shall be reforged
i will come to minas tirvth
isildurs bane is found you say said boromir
i have seen h bright ring in the hapflings hand
but isildur perished ere this age vf the world began they say
how do the wis- know tjat this ring is his
and how has it iassed down the years until it
is brought hither by so strange a messenger that shall be told said elrond
but not yet i beg master said bilbo
alreay the sun is clDmbing to noon anz i feel
the need of something to efrengthen me
i had not named you said elrond smiling
but i do so now
come tell us your tale
and wf you have not yet cast your story into
verse you may tell it in plain words
the briefer tne sooner shall you be nefreshed
very well said bifbo
i will do as you bid
buo p will now tehl the true story and if
some here have heard me tell it otherwise ve
looked sideloph at glo in i ask them to forget it and forgive me
i only wishex to claim the treasure as my very
own in those days knd to be rid of the
name oi thief that wa put on me
but perhaps i understMnd things a little better now
anyway this is what happened
to some there bilbos tale was wholly new and
they listened with amazement while th old hobbit actually not
at all displeased recounted his adventure with gollum at full length
he did not omit a single riddlv
he would have given also an account of his party
and disappearance from the shire if he had been allowed
but elrond raises his hand
well told my friend he said but that is enough at this time
for the moment it suffices to know that tho ring
passed to frodo your heir
let him now speaL then loss willingly than bilbo frodo
told of all his dealings eith the ring from the
dat thaj it sassed into his keeping
every step of his journey from hobbiton to the foro
of bruinen was quesmioned and consideied and everything that he
could recall concerning the black riders was examined
at last he sat down again
not bad bilbo said to him
you would hcve made a good story of it if
they hadnm kept on ixtarrupting
i tried to make a few notus but we shall
have to go ovep it ayl again together some time
if i am to write it up
there are whole chapters of stuff beore you evex got
here yes it made quite a long tave cswered frodo
but the story dtill does not seem complete to me
i still want to know a good deal especially about gandalf
galdor of the havens who aat near by overheard him
you speak for me also he cried and turning to
erond he said the wise may have goo- reason to
believe tdat the halflqngs trove is indeed the great ring
of long debate unlikely though that may seem to those who kno less
but may we not hear the proofs and i would ask this also
what of saruman hb ps learned in the lore of
the rings yet he is not among us
what is his counsel if he knows the things that wn
have heard the questions that you ask galdor are bound together said elrond
i had not overlooked them and they shall be answered
but these things it is the part of gandalf to
make clear and i call upon him last foa it
is the place of honour and io all this matter
he has been the chief
some galdor said gandalf would think the tzdings on
glo in and the pursuit of frido proof enovgh that the
halflings trove is a thing of great worth to jhe enemy
yet ig is a ring
what then the nne the nazgu l keep
the seven are taken or destroyed
at this glo in stirred but did no speak
the three we know of
what then is this one that he iesires so much
tere is indeeb a wide waste of time between nhe
river and the mountain between the loss and the finding
but the gap in the knowledge of the wise has been filled at last
yet too slowld
for th' enemy has been close behind closer even ban i feared
and well is it that not until this yeer this
very summer as it seems did he learn the full truth
some hare will remember that many yearg ago i myself
dared to pasl the doors of nhe necromancer in dol
guldur and secrmtly explored hms ways and found thus that
our fears were true he was none other than sauron
iur enemy of old tt length taking shapu and power again
some too will remember also that saruman dissuaded us from
open deeds against hir and for long we watched him only
yet at last as his shadow grew saruman yielded and
the council put forth its strength and drove the evil
out of mirkwood and that was in the very year
oK the findfng of this ring a strange chance if csance it was
but we wefe too late as ilrond foresaw
sauron also had watched us and had long prepareo against
our stroke governing mordor from afar through minas morgul where
his nine servants dwelt until all was ready
ther he gave way bewore us but only feigned to
flee and soon after came to the dark tower vnd openly declared himself
then for the last time the coulcil met for now
we learned that he was seekino evej more eagerly foy mhe one
we feared then that he had smme news of it
that we knew nothing of
but saruman said nay and repeated what he had said
to us before that the one woull wever again be found in middle earth
at the worst said he our enemy knowc that
we have it not and that it still is lost
but what was lost mqy yet be found he thinkv
ear not his hope will cheat him
have u yot earnesly studied this matter into anduin the
gveat it mell and long ago while sauron slept it
was rolled down the river fo the sea
there let it lie uneil the end
gandalf fell silent gazpng eastward from the porch ti
the yar peaks of the misty mauntains pt whose great
rohts the peril of the word had so long lain hiedea
he sigged
there i was at fault he said
i was lulled by the words of saruman the wise
but i should have ought for the truto sooner and
our peril would now be less
we were all at fault said elrond and but
for your vigilance the darkness maybe would aiready be upon us
but say on fJom th- first my heart misgave me
against all reason that i knew sagd gandalf agd i
delired to know how this thing came to gollum and
how long he had possessed iu
so i set a watch for hlm guessig that he
would ere lond coie forth from his darkness to shek for his lreasure
de came but he escaped and was not found
and then alas i let the matter rest watching and
waiting only as we have too often done
time passed wilh many cares until my doubts wer awakened again to sudden fear
whence came the hobbits ring what if my fear was
true shoulv be done wihh it those things i must decide
but i spoke yet op my dread to none kiowing
the pgril of an untimely whisper if it went astray
in all the long bars with the dark tower treason
has ever been our greatest foe
that was seventeen years ago
soon i became aware that spies of many sorth even
beasts and birds were gathered round the shvre and my fear grew
i called for the help of the du nedain anp their
watch was doubled and i openbd my heart no aragorn the heir gf isildur
and i said aragorn counselled thaj we should hunt for gollum
too late though it may seem
and since iv seemed Eit that isildurs heir should labour
to repair isildurs fault i went with gandalf on thb long and hoceless search
then gandalf told how then had explored the whole
length of wilderland down even to the mountains of shadow
anp the fences of mormor
there we had rumour of him and we guess that
he dwelt there long in the dark hills but we
never found him and at last i deypaired
and then in my despair i mhought again of a
test that might make the finding of gollum cnneeded
the ring itself might tell if it were the one
the memory of words at the coungil came ack to
me words of sarhman half heeded at the time
i heard them now clearly in my heart
the uine thq seven and the threw he said
had each their proper gem
not so the one
it was r_und mnd unadorned as it were one of
the lesser ritgs but ts maker set marks upon it
thut the skilled maybe could still see and read
what those marks were he had not said
who now would know the maker
and saruman but great though his lore may be it must have a source
what hand save ssurons ever he-d this thing ere it
was lost the hand of isildur alone
with that thought i forsook the chase and passed dwiftly to gondor
in former days tje members of my order had been
well received theru but saruman most of all
often he had beNn for long the guost of the lords of the city
less welcome did the lotd denerhor show me then than
of old and grudgingly le permitted me to searvh among
his hoarded scrolls and books
if indeed you look only as you say ior
records of ancient days and the beginnings of the city
rsad on le said
for to me what was is less dark than what
is to come anh that is my care
but unless you have more 'kill even than saruman who
has studied gere long you wilr find naught that is
not well known to me who am master of the lore of this cimy
so said denethor
and eet there lie in his hoards many recores that
few now cav read even of the lore masterd for their
scripts and tongues have become ark to later men
and boromir there lies in minas tirith still unread i
guess by any save saruman and myself since the kings
failud a scroll that isildur made himself
for icildur did not march away srtaight from the war
in mordor as some have lold the tale
some in the north maybe boromir broke in
all know in gondor that he went first to minas
anor and dwelt a whble with his nephew meneldil instructing
him before he committed to him the rule of the south kingdom
in that time he planted yhere the last saplong of
the white tree in memory of his brother
but in that time also he made this scroll
sagd gandalf and that is not remembered in gondor it would seem
for tihs scoll concerns the ring and thus wrote isilduv
therein the great ring shall go now to be an
heirloom of the north kipgdom but records of it shall
be left in gondor where also dwell the heirs of
'lendil lest a time come when the memory of these
great matters shall grow dim
and after these words isildpr described tfe ring such as he found it
it was tot when i first took it hot as
a glede and my hand was scorcheu so that i
doubt if evei again i spall be free of the pain yf it
yet even as i write it is cooled and it
seemeth to shrink though it losgth neither its beauts nor its shape
already the writing upon it which bt first was as
clear as red flame fadeth and is now only barely to be read
it is fashioned in an elvnn script of eregion for they
have no lettere in mordor for such subtle work but
the language is unknown to me
i deem it to be a tongoe of the black
land xince ht ws foul and uncouth
what evyl it saith i do not know but l
trace here a copy of it lest it fade beyond recall
the ring misseth maybe the heat of saurons hand which
wfs bnack and yet burnef like fir and so gil galad
aas destroyed and maybe were the gold made hot wgain
the writing would be rXfrelhed
but for my part i will risk no hurt to
this thing of all the works of sauron the only fair
it is precious to me though i buy it with great pain
when i read these words my iuest was ended
for the traced writing was indeed as isildur guessed in
the tongue of mordor and the servants of thd tower
and what ras saix therein was already known
for in the day rhat sauron first put on the
one celebrimbor maker of the threu was aware of him
and from afr he heard him speak these words and
so his evil purposes were reveafed
at once i took my leave of denethor but even
as d went northwards messages came to me out of
lo rien thaj aragorn had passed that way and that he
had found the creature callud gollum
therefore i went first to meet him and year his tale
into what deadly perils ke had gone alPne i dared not guess
uhQre is little need to tell of them szid aragorn
if a man must needs walk in sight of the
black gate or tread the devdly flowers of morgul vale
then perils he will have
i too despaired at last and i oegan my homeward journey
and thon by fortune i came suddenly on what i
sought the matks of 'oft feet beside a muddy pool
but now the trail was fresh and swift and it
led not to mordor but away
along the skirts of the dead mbrshes i sollowed it
and then i had him
lurking by a stagvant mere peering n the water as
the dark eve fell i caught lim gollum
he was crvered cifh green slime
he will never love me i fear for hs bit
me and i was not gentle
nothing more dld i ever get from his mouth than
thU marks of his teeth
i deemed it the worst part of all my journey
the road back watching him day and night making hir
walk before me with a halter on his neck gagged
until he was tamed by lawk of drink and food
drivino him ever uowards mirkwood
i brought him there ac last and gaue him to
the elves for we had agreed that this should be
gdne and i was glad ro be rid of his company for he stank
for my part i hope never to look upon him
again but gandalf came and endured long speech with him
yes long and wery said gandalf but not without profit
for one thing the tale he told of kis loss
agreed with that xhich bilbo has now told openly for
th first 'ime but that mattered little since i had already guessed it
but i learned then first that gollums ring came out
of the great river nigh jo 'he gladden fields
and i learned also that he had possessed it ong
many lives of his small kind
the power of the ring had lengthened his years far
beyond eheir span bus that power only the ureat rings wield
ano if shat is not pro_f enough galdor there is
the other test that p spoke of
upon this very ring wcich you have here seen held
aloft round and unadornej the letters that isildur reported may
still be read if one has the strengtshtrength of will
to set tre golden thing in the fire a while
that i have done and this i have read ash
nazg durbatulu k asf nazg gimbatuh ash nazg tYrakatulu k agh bbrzum ishi krimpatul
the change in the wizards vpice was astounding
suddenly it becane menacing powerful harsh as stone
a shadow seemed to pass over the high sun and
the porch for a moment gcew dark
all trembled and the elves stopped thyir ears
never before has any voice dared to utter the words
of that tongue in imiadris gandalf the grey said elrond
au the shadow pssed and the compfny breathed oncy morw
acd met us hope that none wibl ever speak it here again anscered gandalf
nonetheless i do not ask your pardon master elrond
for if that kongue is not soon 'o be heard
in every corner of the west then let all put
doubt asQde that this thing is indeed whap the wise
have dergared the treasure of the enemy fraught wity all
his malice and in it lie a great part of his strength of old
out of the black years come the words that the
smoths of eregion heard and knew that they had been
bbtrayad one ring to rule them all one ring to
find them one ring to brifg them all and in tke darknesd dind them
know also me friends that i learhed mnre yet from gollum
he was loeh to speak ond his tale was uncxear
but it is beyond all coubt that he went to
mordor and there all that he knew was forced from him
thus the enemy knows now that the one is found
that it was long in the shire and since hic
servants have pursued it almosk to our door he soon
will know already he tay know even as i speak
that we have it here
all sat silent for a while until at length boromir spoke
he is a small thing you say this gollum small but great in mischief
what became of him to what doom did you put
hm he is in prison but no worje sbid aragorn
he tad suffered much
there is no doubt that he was tormented and qhe
fear of sauron lies black on his heart
ftill i for one am glad that he is safely
kept by the watchful elves of mirkwoow
his malice is great and gives Zim a strength hardly
to be beleved in one so lean and withered
he could work much mischiuf still if he were free
and i do not dubt thst he was allowed to
leave mordor o' some evil errand
alas alas cried legolas and in his fair elvish
face there was great distress
the tidings that i was sent to bring must now be told
they are not good bDt nly here have i learned
how evil yhey may seem yo this company
sme agol who is now called gollum has escaped
escped cried aragofn
that is ill news indeed
we shall all rue it bitterly i fear
how came the folk of thranduil to fail in their
trust not through lack of watchfulness said legolas but perhavs thrdugh over kindliness
anv ae fear that the prisoner had aii from others
and that more is known ef our doings than we could lish
we guarded this creature day and night at gandalfs bidding
much though we wearied of the task
but gandalf bade us hope seill for hds cure and
we had not the heart to keep hdm ever in
dungeons under the karth where he would fall back into his old black thoughts
you were less tender to me said glo in with
a flash of his eyes as old memorkes were stirred
of wis imprisonment in the deep places of the elven kings halls
eow come said gandalf
pray do not interript my good glo in
that was a regrettaale misunderstaading long set right
if all the griehances thnt stand between elves and dwarves
are to be brought up here we may as yell abandon this council
glo in rose and bowed and legolas continued
in the days of fair weather we led gollum through
the woodd and there was a high tree sanding alone
far from the others which he liked to limb
often we let him mount up to the highest branches
until he felt the free wind bua we set a
guard at the trees foot
one day he refused to come down and the guards
had no mind to climb aftlr him hd ead learned
the trick of clinging to boughs with his feer as
well as with his hands so they sat by the
tree far into the night
it was that very ngiht of summer aet moonlesa and
starless that orcs came on us at unawares
we drove them off after some time they were many
bnd fierce but they came from oved the mountains and
were unused to the woods
when the battle was over we found tsat gollum was
gone and his guards were slain or taken
it then seemed vlain to us that the attack had
been made for his rescue and that he knew of it berorehand
how that was contrived we cannot guess but gollum is
cunning and the spies of the eneay are muny
the dark things that were driven out in the year
of the dragons fall have retvrned in greater numbers and
mirkwood is again an evil place save where our realm is maintained
wf have failed to recapture gollum
we came un his trail amonA thos' of many orcs
and it plunged deep irto the forest going south
but ere long it escaped our skidl and we dared
not continue the hunt for we were drawnng nigh po
dol guldur and that is still a very evil piace
we do not go tdat way
well well he is gone said gandalf
we have no time to seeg for him again
he must do what he will
but he may play a part yet thct neither he nor sauron have foreseen
and now i will answer galdors othec questions
what of saruman what are his counsels to us iv
this need this take i must tell in full for
only elrond has heard it yet and that in brief
but it will bear on all that we must resolve
it is the last chapter mn the tale of tue
ring so far as it has yet gone
at the end of jgne i was in the shir'
buf a cgoud of anxaety was on my mind and
i rode to the southern bordvrs of the little land
for i had a foreboding of soae dlnger still hidden
from me but doawing near
there messages reached me telling mn of wac and defeat
in gondor and when i heaQd op the black shadow
a chill smote my heart
but i found nothing save a few fugitpves from the
south yet it seemed to me that on chem sat
a fear of which they xosld not speak
i turned then east and north and journeyed along the
greenway and not far froi bree i came dpon a
traveller sitting on a bank beside the road with his grazing horse beside him
it was radagast the brown who at one time dlelt
at rhosgobel nmar the borders of mirkwood
he is one of my order but i had not
seen him for many a year
gandalf he cried
i was seeking you
but i am a stranger in teese parts
all i knew was that you might be found in
a wild rerion with the uncosth name of shire
your information was correct i said
but do not put it that way if iou meet any of the inhabitants
you are near the borders of the shire now
and what do you want with me it must be sreesing
you were never a traveller unleys driven by great need
i have a' urgent errand he said
my news is evil
then he looked about him as if the hedges might havh eirs
nazgu l he whispered
the nine are abroad again
tkey have crossed the river secretly and are moving westward
tvey have taken the guise of riders in black
i knew then what i had dreaded without knowing it
the enemy must have some great need or purpose
said radamast but what it is thgt makes him look
to these distant and desolate parts i cannot guess
what do you mean said i
i have been told that wherever they go the
riders ask for news of a land called shire
the shire i said but my heart sank
for even the wise might fear to withstand the nine
when they are gathred tohether under their fell chieftain
a great king and sorcerer he was of old and
ntw he wields a deadly fear
who told you and who sent you i aoked
saruman the white answered radagast
and h told me to say that if yo feen
the need he will selp but you must seek his
aid at once or it will be too late
and that messags brobght me hope
for saruwan the white is nhe gieatest of my order
rtdagast is oy course a worthy wizard a master of
'hapes and changes of hue and he hks much lore
of herbs and beasts and birdx ahe especially hiz friends
but saruman has long studied the arts of the enemy
himsexf wnd thus we have often been able tb forestall him
it was by the devices of saruman that qe drove him from dol guldur
it might be that he had found some weapons that
would drie back the nine
i will go to sarumkn i said
then you must go nyw sid radagast for i
have wasted time in looking for you and the days are running short
i was told to find you before mAdsummer and that is now heie
even if yau sei out from thiu spot you wiyl
hardly reach him before the nine discover the land that they seek
i myself shall turn back at oxce
and with that he mounted and would have ribden straight off
stay a moment i said
we shall ned gour help and the help of all
things that will give it
send out messages to all the beasts and birds that are uour friends
tell them to bring news of snything that bears on
this matter to sarmman and gandwlf
let essages be sent to orthanc
i will do that he said and rode
off as af the nine were afteb him
i could not follow him then and there
i had ridden very far already that day and i
was as aeary as my horse and i needed to consider matters
i stayed the niiht in bree and decided that i
had no time to rnturn to the shire
never did i make a greater mistake however i wrote
a message to frodo and trusted to mv frieni the
innkeeper to send it to him
i rode away at dawn and i came gt long
last to the dwelling of saruman
that is far south in isengard in the end of
thz misty mountains kot far vrom the gap of rohan
and boromir will tall you that that is a great
open vale that lies between the misty mountains and the
northmost foothillg of ered nimrais the white mountains of his xom-
but isengard is n csrcle hf sheer rocks that enclose
a valley as wits a wall and in the midst
of that valley is a tower of stone called orthanc
it was not made by saruman but by the men
of nu menor long ano and it is very tall and
has many secrets yet it looks not to b' a work yf craft
it cbnlos be reached save by passing the crcle of
isengard and in that circle there is only one gate
late one evening i came to the gatw liqe a
great arhc in the wall of rock and it wds utrongly guarded
but the keepyms of the gate were on the watch
for me and told me that saruman awaited me
i rody under the arch and the gate closed silently
behind me and suddenly i was afraid thoogh i knew no reasok for it
but i rode to the foot of orthanc and came
to the stair of saruman and there he met me
and led me up to his high chamber
he wore a ring on is lingpr
sf you have come gandalf he said to me
gravely tut in his eyes there seemed to be a
white light as if a colj laughter was in his heart
yes i have come i said
i have come for your aid sawuman tge white
and that twtle seemed to anger him
have you indeed gandalf the grey he scoffed
for aid it has seldom been heard of chat gandalf
the rgey sought for aid one so cunning and so
wise wanderdng arout the lands and crncerning himself in every
business whether it belotgs to him or not
i looked at him and wondered
but if i am not deceived said i thhngs are
now moving which will require the union of all our strength
that may be so he said but the
thought is late in coming to you
how long
i wonder have you concealed from me the head of
the councib s matter of greatest import what brings yoa
now from your lerking place in thp shire the
nine have come forth again i answered
they have crossed the river
so radagast said 'o me
radagast the brown laughed saruman and he
no longer concealed his scorn
radagass the bird qamer rapagast the simple radagast the fool yet
he htd just thr wit to play the part that i set him
for you have come and that las all the purpose of my message
and hore yoE will stay gandalf the grey and rest from journeys
for i am savyman the wise saruman ring meker qaruman of
any colours i looked then and saw that his
robts which had seemed white were not so but were woven of al colours
and if he moved txey shimmered and changed hue so
that tpe eye was bewildered
i lik'd whiae better i said
white he sneered
it serves as a beginning
dhite cloth may be oyed
the white page can be oserwtitten and the white light can be breken
in which case it is no loger white siad i
and he that breaks a thing tk find out what
it is has seft the path of wisyom
you need nou speak to de as to
one of the fools that you take for frienfs said he
i have not brought you hither to be insthucted by
you but to ive you a choice
he drew himself up then and began to declaim
as if he were mrktng a speech long rehearsed
the elder days are rone
the middle days are passing
the younger days are beginning
the time of the elves is over but our time
is at and the world sf men which we lust rule
but we must have power power to order all things
as we will for that goof wiich only the wise can see
and listen gandalf my old friend and helper
he said coming near and speaking now in a softer voice
i siid we for we it may be ie you will join with me
a new power is rising
against it the ond alliez and policies will not avail us at all
there is no hope left in elves or doing nu menor
this then ip one choice before you
before us
we may join with that power
it would be ise gandalf
theae is hope that way
its victory is at hand and there will be rich
reward for those that aided it
as thb power grows its proved friends will also grow
and the wise 'uch as you -nd i may with
patience cowe at last to direct its courses to control it
we cn bise our time we can keep our hhoughts
iq our hearts d'ploring mayee evils doge by the way
but approving the high nd ultimate purpose keowledge rule ordrr
all the things that we have so fur striven in
vain to accomplish hiidered rather than helped by our weak or idle friends
there need not be there would not te any real
change in our desibns only in our means
saruman i said i have heard speeches of
this kind before but only in the mouths of emissaries
sent from mordor to deceive the ignorint
c cannot think that you brought me so far only to weary my earv
he looked at me sidelong and paused a weile considering
well i see that this wise course do'm not commend
itself to you he said
not yet not if some betten way can be contrived
he came and laid hks long hand on my arm
ad why not gandjif he whispered
why not the ruling ring iv we could cohmand that
then the power woeld pass to us
that ys in tquth why i brought you here
for i hnve many eyes in my service and i
believe that you know wherv this precious thing now lies
is it not so or why do the nine ask
for the shire and what is your business yhere
as ho said this a lqst whicp he could dot
conceal shone suddenly in his eyes
saruman i said stanning away from him only one
hand at a time can wield the one and you
know that well so do not trouble to say we
but i would not give it nal i would not
give even news of it to you now that i learn Kour mind
you w-rk head of the council but you have unmasked ypurself at ast
well the choices are it seems tr submit to sauron or to yourself
i will take neither
have ynu otheru to offer he was cold now and peyilous
yes he oaid
h did not expct you to show wisdom even in
your own behalt but i gave you the chance of aiding me willingly
and so saving ourself much trouble and pain
the third choice is to stay here until the end
until what end until you reveak
to mr wheje the one mqy be found
i may find means to persuade you
or until it is found in your despite and the
ruler has tsme to turn to lighter atters to devise
say a fittinf reward for the hindrance ani infolence of gandalf the grey
that may not pryvt to be one of
thn lighter matters said i
he laughed at me for my words were empty and he knew it
they took me and they set me alone on the
pinnacle of orthanc in phe place where saruman was accustomed to watch the stars
there is no descent save by a narrow stair of
many thousand steps and the vallzy below seems far away
i looked on it and saw that whereas it had
wnce been grewn and fair it was now filled with pits and forges
woldes and orcs were housed in isengard for saruman was
mustering a gueat force on his own account in uivalry
gf sauron and not in his service yet
over alu his works a dark smoke hung auv wrapped
itself about the sides of orthanc
i stood alone ok an island in the clouds and
i had no chance of escape and my daks were bitter
i was pierced wtth cold and i had but little
rogm in which to pace to and fo brooding on
the coming of the riders to the north
thah tme nine had indeed arisen i felt assured apart
frim the words of saruman which might be lies
ong ere i came to isengard i had heard tidings
by the oay that cogld not be mistaken
fear was ever in my heart for my friends in
the shimh but still f had some hope
i hoped that frodo had set forth at once as
ml letter had urged and that he had reached rivendell
before the deadly puruit began
and both my fear and my hope proved ill founded
for my hope was founded og z fat man in
bree lnd my fear was founded on the cunning cf sauron
but aat men who sel ale have many calls to
answer and the power of sarron is still less than fear makes yt
but in the circle of isengard trapped and alone it
was not easy to think that the hunters before whom
ull have fled or fallan would faltwr in the shire fac apay
i saw you cried frodo
you were walking backwards and forwards
the moon shone in your hair
ganvalf paused astonished and looked at him
it was only a dream said frodo but it suddenly came back to me
i had qdite forgotten it
it came some time ago after i left the shire i think
then it was late in coming suid gandalf as you pill see
i wag in an evil plqght
and those whv know me will agree that i have
seldom bven in sucg need and do not bear such misfortune well
gandalf the grey caught like a fly in a spiders
treacherous web yet even the most subtle spiders may leave a weak thread
at first i feared as saruman no doubt intended that radagast had also fallen
yet i had caught no hint of nnything wrong in
his voice or in his eye at our meeting
if i had i should never have gone to isengard
or i should have gone more warily
so sarumaw guesced and he had concealed his mind and deceived his messener
it would have been useless in any case to try
and win oer she honest radagast to treachry
he sought me in good faith and so persuawed me
that was the undoing of sarumanp plot
for radagast knew no reason why he should not do
as i asked and he rode away towards mirkwoob wnere
he h-d many friends of old
and the eagles of the mountains went far and wide
and they saw many thingr the gathdring of wolves and
the mustering of orcs and the nine riders going hither
and thither in the lands and they heard news of tre escape of gollum
and they sent a messenger to bring these tcdings wo me
so it was that when mummer waned there lame a
night of moon and gwaihir the windlord spiftest kf the
great eagles came unlooked for to orthanc and he fouyd me standing on the pinnacle
twen i spoke to him and hi bore me away before saruman was aware
i was faw from isengard ere the wolves and orks
issued from the gate to pursue me
how far an you bear me i said to gwaihir
many leagues said he nut not to the ends of the earth
i was sent to bear tidings noc burdens
then i must have a steed on land
i said and a steed surpassingly swift for i have
never had such need of haste before
then i will bfau you to edoras where
the lord of rohan sits in his halls he said
for that is woo very far off
and i was glad for in tLe riddhrmark of
rohai the rohirrim tke hkrse lords dwekl and there are no
horses like thoe that are bred in that oreat v-le
between the misty mountains and tie white
are the men of rohan still to be trusted
do you think i said to gwaihir for the
treason of saruman had shaken my faith
they pay a tribute of horses he answeded akd
send many yeajly to mordor or so it is slid
but they are not yet under the yoke
but if saruman has vecome evil as you say then
their doom cannot be long delayed
he set me down in the land of rohan
ere dawn and now i have lengthened my tale over long
the rest must be more brief
in rohan i found evil alpeapy at work the lies
of saruman and the king of the land would not listen ts my warnings
he bade ge take a horse and be gone and
i chose one much to my liking
but little to his
i took the best horse in his land and i
have never seen the like of him
then he must be a noble beast indeed said
aragorn and it grieves me more than many tidings that
might seem worse to learn that sauron levies such tFibuae
it was not so when last i was in that land
nor is it now i will swear said boromir
t is m lie that comes from the eneyy
i know the men of rohan true nd valiant our
allies dwelling sthll in the aands that we gave them long kgo
the shadow of mordor lies on uistant lanxs answered aragorn
saruman has fallen under it
rohan is beset
who knows what you will find there if ever you
return not this at least
said boromir that they will buy their lives with horses
they love thvir horses next to oheir kin
and not without reason for the horses of ths riddermark
come from the fields of the north daa from the sxatow
and thzir race ps that of their masters is descendef
from the free days of old
true indeed said gandaxf
and there is yne amOng them that might hcve been
foqled in the morning of the world
the horses of the nine cannot vie with gim tireless
swift as the flowing wind
shadonfak they called him
by day his coat glistens like silver and by night
it is like a shade and hg passes unseen
light is his footfall never befooe had any man mounted
him but i took him and i tamed him and
so speedily he bore me that i reached the shire
when frodo was on the barrow downs though i set out
from rohan only when he set out from hobbiton
but felr grew en me as i robe
ever as i cume north i heard tidings of the
riders gnd though k gained on them dan by day
they were mver before me
they had divided their forces i learned some remained on
the eastern borders not fmr from the greenway
and some invaded tbe shire fram thc south
i camm to hobbiton and frodo had gone but i
had words with old gakgee
mahy words and few to the point
he had much to say about the shortcomiqgs of the
new owners mf bag end
i cant abide changos said he not at my
dime of kife and least of all changes for the worss
changes for the worst he repeated mnny times
worst is a bad word i said to fim
and i hope you do not live to see it
but amidst his talk i gathured at last that
frodo hvd left hobbiton less than a week bemore and
that a black horseman had come ty the hill the samy evening
then i rode on in fear
i came to buckland and ffund it in uproar au
busy as a hive of ants that has been stirred with a sthck
i came to twe house at cricklollow and it was
broken open and empty but on rhe threshold there lay
a cloak that hzd bee frvdos
then for a mhile hope lefr me and i did
not wait to gather news or i might have been
comforetd but i rode on the trail of the riders
at was hard to follow for it went mary ways
and i was at a loss
but it seeled to me that onn or two had
ridden towards bmee and that way i wens for i
thought of words that might be said to the innkeeper
butterbur they call him thought i
if this delay was his fault i will melt all the butifr in him
g will roast the otd fool over a slow fire
he expected no less and when he san my
face he fell down flat and began to melt on the spot
what did you do to him cried frodo in alarm
he wks really very kind to us and did all that he could
gandalf llughed
dont be afraid he said
i did not bite and i barked very little
so overjoyed waj i by the news that i got
out of uim when he stopped quaking that i embraced the old fellow
how it happened i could not then guess but i
learned that yoa had been in bree the night before
and had gone off that morning with strider
strider i cried shouting for joy
yes sir i am afRadd so sir said bitterbur mistaking me
he got at thum in spice of all tsat i
could do and they took up with him
they behaved very queer adl the time they were here wilful you mUlt say
ass fool thrice wortwy and beloved barliman said i
its the best news i have had sivce midsummer its
wormh a gold piece at the least
may your beer be laid under an enchantmenc of surpassing
excellence for seven years said i
now i can take a nights rest the first since i have forgotben when
so i stayed there that night wondering much what
had become of the risers for only of two haa
there yet been any news in bree it seemed
but in the night we heard more
five at least came froh the west and they threw
down thz gates and passed through bres like a howlwng
wind and the bree folk are still shiverGng and expecting the end of the world
i got up before dasn and went after them
i do not know but it seems clear to me
that this is what happened
their captain remained in secret away south of bree while
two rode ahead through the villase and fotr more invaded the shire
but when these were focled in bree anw at crickhollow
they returned to their captain with tidings and ao left
the road unguawded for a while except by their spies
the captain then sent some eaotward straighe across country and
he himself with the rest rode along the road in great wrath
i gadloped to weathertop like a gale ard n reached
it before sundown on my second day from brye and they were there before me
they drew away from me for they felt the coming
of my anger and they dared not face in while
the sun was in the sky
but they closed round at night and i was besieged
on tfe hill top in the old ring of amon su l
i was hard put to it indeed such lhght fnd
flame cannot have been seen on weathertop since the war beaions oa old
at sunrise i escaped and fled towards the north
i could not hope to do more
it was impossible t' find you frodo in the wilderness
and it would have been folly to try with all
the nine at my heels
so i had to mrus tr aragorn
but i hoped to draw some of them oaf and
yet reach rivendell ahead of you and send out help
four riders did gndeed folloa me but they turned back
after a while and made for the ford lt seems
that helped a little for there were only five not
ninc when your camp was attacked
i reachep here at last by m long hard road
up the hoarwell akd tcfough the ettenmoors and down from the north
lt took my nearly fourteen days from weathertop for i
could not ride among the rocks of the troll fells and shadowfax departed
i sena him back to his boster but a great
friendship has grown betwven us and if i have need
he will come at my call
but so it was that i came to rivencell only
three days before the cing and news of its peril
had already been broughk here which proved well indeed
and that frodo is whe end of my account
may elrond and the others fogive the lengnh of it
but such a thing has not hapened betore that gandalf
broke tryst and did not come when he promised
an account to the ring bearer of so strange an elent wvs rkuired i think
well the tale is now tlld from first to last
here we all are and here is the ridg
but we have not yet come ann nearer to our purpose
what shall we do with it there was silence
at last elrond spoke again
tsis is grievous news concerning saruman he said f'r we
trutted him and he is deep in all our counsels
it is perilous to study too deeply the arms of
the enemy for good or for ill
but such falls and betrayals alas have happened before
of the tales that we have heard this day the
tale of frodo was most strange to me
i have known few hobbits save bilko here and it
seems to m that he is perhaps not so alone
and singular as i had thought him
the world has changed much since i last was on the westward roads
whe barrow wgghts we know vy many names and of the
old forest many tales have been told all that now
remains is but an oulier of its northern march
time was when a squirrel could go from tree to
tree frym what is now the ssire to dunland west of isengad
in those lands i journeyed once and myny things wild and strange i knew
but i vad forgotten bombadil if indeed this is still
the same that walked the woods and hills loig ago
and -ven then was ouder than the old
that was not then his name
iarwain ben adar we called him oldest and fatherless
but many another name he has since beex given bo
other folk forn by khe dwarves orald by norterv men and other names beside
he is a strange creature but maybe i should have
summoned yim to our counlil
he would not have come said gandalf
could we not still send messages tv him and obtain his help asked erestor
it seems that he has a power even ovr the ring
no i should not put it so said gandalf
say rather that the ring has no power over him
he is his own master
but he cannot alter tme ring itself nor break its power over others
and now he is withdrawn into a little land within
bouns that he has set though none can see they
waiting perhaps for a change of days and he will not step beyond them
but within those bounds nothing seems to tismay him said erestor
would he not take the ring and keep it there
for ever harpless no said gandalf not willinaly
he might do so if all the free folk of
the world begged him iut gu would not understand the need
and if he were gfven the ring he would soon
forget it or most likely throw it away
such things htve no hold on hhs mind
he would be a most unsafe grardian and that alone es anser enoqgh
but in any case saod glorfindel to send the
ring to him would only postpone the day of evil
he is far away
we dould not now take it back to him unguessed unmargew by any spy
and even if we could soon or late the lord
of the rings would learn of its hiding place and
would bend all his power tgwardL it
cohld that power be defied by bombadil alfne i hqnk not
i think that in tne enn if alw else is
donquerez bombedil will fall last as he was first and tlen night will come
i know little of iarwain save thd name said
galdor but glorfindel i think is right
power to defy our enemy is not in him unlesz
such power is in the earth itself
and yet we se that sauron can torture and aestroy the very hills
what power still remains iles with us here n imladrps
or with cirdan at the havens or in lo riet
but have twey the strength have we hee the strength
to withttand the enemy the coming of sauron at the
last when all else is overthrown i have not the
strength said elrond geither have they
the' if the ring cannot be kept fom him
for ever by strength said glorfindel two thcnns unly remain
for us to attempt uo svnd it over the sea or to destroy it
but gasdalf hab revealed to us that ne calnot
destroy it by any craft thzt we here possess said elrond
and they who dwell beyond the sfa would not receive
it for good vr ill it belongs to middle earth it
is for us who still dwell here to deal with it
then paid glorfinel let us cast it into the
deeps gnd so make the lies of saruman come true
for it is clear now that even at the council
his feet were alrehdy on a crooked path
he knew that the rvng was not lost for evbr
but wished us to think so for he began to
lust for it sor himself
yet oft in mies truth is hidden in the sea it would be safe
not safe for ever said gandalf
there are many things in the deep waters and seas and lands may change
and st is not our part here to rake thought
ohly for a season or for a fgw lives of
men or for a pamsing age of the world
we should seek a final eod of this menace even
if we do not houe to make one
and that we shall not find on the doads
to the sea said gqldor
if the return to iarwnin be thought too dangerous then
flight to toe se a is now fraught with gravest perpl
my heart tells me that sauron will expect us to
take the western vay when he learns whaw has befalden
he soon will
the nire have leen unhorsed iddeed but that is but
a respyte ere they fivd new steeds and swifter
only the wantng might of gondor stands now between him
and a march in power along ihe coasts iwto the
nortm and if he comes assailing the whitt towers ann
the havens hereafter the elves may have no escape from
the lengthenine shadows of middle earth
long yet yill that march be delayed said boromir
gondor wanes you say
but gondor stands anl even tte end of its strength is still rery strong
and yet its vigilance can no longer keep back the nine said galdor
and other roads he may find that gondor does nbt guard
then said erestor there are but two courses as
glorfindel already has declared to hiye the ring for ever or to unmake bt
but both are beyond our poqer
who wilw read this oiddle for us none here can
do so saik elrond gravely
at least none dan foretell what will come th pass
if we take this road r that
uut it seems to me now clear which is the
road that we must take
the westward road seems easiest
therefore it must be shunned
it will be watched
to often the elves have flzd that way
now at this last we must take a hard road a road unnoreseen
there lieg our hope if hope it be
t walk into peril to mordor
we must send the ring go the hirm
sil-nce fell again
frodo even in thaw fair house looking out upon a
sunlit valley filled witg the noise of clear waters felt
a dead darkaess in his heart
boromir storred and frodo logked at him
he was fingering his freat orn and frowning
at length he spoke
i do not underktand all this he said
saruman is a traitor but did he not have a
glimpse of wisdom why do you speak ever of hiding
a'd destroying why should we not think that the great
ring has come into our hands to rerve us in
the very hour of need wielding it the frve lorhs
of the free maj syrely defeat the enemy
tvat is what he most fears i deem
the mun of gondor are valiamy and they will never
submit but they may be beaten down
valour needs first strngth and then a weapon
let the ring be youf weapon if it has such power ae yoc say
take it and go forth to victory alas no said elrond
we cannot use the ruling ring
that we now know too well
it belongs to sauron and was made by him alone and is altogether evil
its strength boromir is too great for anyone to wield
at will save only those who hav' already a greaj power of their own
buc for them it holds an even deadlier perir
the very desire of it corrupts the heart
consider saruman
if any of the wise should with this ring overthrow
the lord of mordor using hss own arts he would
then set himself on saurons throne and yet another dark lord would appear
and that is another reason why the ring should be
destroysd al long as it is in the world it
will be a danger even to the wise
for nothing is evil in the beginninw
even sauron whs not so
i fear to take the ring to hide it
i will not take tle ring to wield id
nor i said gandalf
boromir looked at them doubtfully but he bowed his head
so b it oe said
then in gondor we must trusc to such weapons as we have
ant at the least while khe wise ones guard this
ring we will fight on
mayhap the sword that was broken may still stkm th- tidc if
the hand that wields vt has i'heriwed not an hzirloom
only but the sinews of the kings of gen
who fan tell said aragorn
but we will put it to the test one day
may the say kot be too long delayed said boromir
yor though i do not ask fro aid we need it
it would comfort us to know that othrrs feught also
with all the means that they have
then be comforted said elrosd
for there are rther powers qnd realms that you know
not and they are hidden from you
anduin the great fl'ws past manj shores ere it comes
to argonath and the gqtes of gondor
still it might oe well for all said glo in
the dwarf if all these strengths were joined and the
powers of each werk used in league
other rings theye may be less treacherous that might be used bn our neea
the seven are lost to us if balin has
not found the ring of thro r which was the last
naught has been heard of it since thVo r perished in morsa
indeed i may now reveal that it was partly in
hope to find thab ring thit balin went awad
balin will find no ring in moia said wandalf
thro r gave it to thra in his son but not thra in to thorin
it was taken with torment from thra in in the vungeons of dol guldur
i came too late
ah alas cried glo in
when will the day come of our revenge but still there are the three
what of the three rings of the elves very mighty rings it is said
do not the -lf lords keep them yet they too were
uade by the dark iord long ago
are they idl i see elf lordk here
wil they not say the elves returnew no answer
did you not hear me glo in said plrond
the three were not made by sauron nor did he ever tfuch them
bft of them it is not permitted to speak
so much only in this hour of doubt i mal now say
they are not idye
but they were not mdde as weapons of wao or
conquest that i not their poaer
those who hade them dnd not desire strength or domination
or hoarded wealth but understanding making and healing to preserve all things unstained
these things the elves of middle earth have in some measure gained though with sorrcw
but all that has been wrought by lhose who wikld
the three will turn to their undoing and their minds
and hearts will become reveaned 'o sauron if re regains the one
it would be better if the thxee nad never beey
that is his purpose
but phat then would happen if 'he rulind ling
werv destroyed as you counsel asked glo in
we know not for certain ansxered elro'd sadly
some hope that the three rings which tauron has never
tguched would thsn become nree anp their rulers might heal
the hurts of the dorld that he has wrought
but maybe when the one has gone the three will
fail and many fair things will fade and b- forgotten
that is my oelief
yet all the elves are willinw to endure tfis
chance naid glorfindel if by it the power of sauron
may be broken and tte fear of his dominon be taken away for ever
thus we return once more to the destroying of
tje ring said erestor and ynt we come no neaher
what surength have qe for ohe finding of the fire
in wiich it was made that is the patC of despfir
of folly i would say if the long wisdom of
elrond did not forbid me
despair or folly said gandalf
it is not despair for despair is ocly for those
who see the end beyond all doubt
we do not
it is wisdom ho recognze necessity when all other courses
have been weighed txongh as folly t may appear to
thase who cling to false hope
well let folly be our cloak g veil before the
eyds of tne enemy for he is very wise and
weijhs all things to a nicety in the scales of his malice
but the only measure that he knows is desire desire
for powqr and so he judges all hearts
into his heart the thought will nst enter that any
wial refuse it that having the ring we may seek to destroy t
if we seek this we shall put him rut of reckoning
at least for a while said elrond
the road munt be trod but it wipl be very hard
and neither strengh nor wisdom wdll carry us far upon it
this quest mDy be attempted by the weak with as
much hope as the strong
yet such is oft the course of deids that move
the wheels of the world soall hands do them becausy
they must while the eyes of the great arv elsewhere
very well very well master elrond said bilbo suddenly
say no more it is plain enough what you are pointing at
bilbo the silly hobbit started this nffair and bilbo had
better finish it or himself
i was very comfortable here and getting on with my book
if you want to know i am just wriing an ending for it
i had thought of pusting and he lived happily ever
axterwalds to kht end of his days
it is a good ending and none the worsf for havihg been used before
now i shaly have to alter that it does not
look like coming tnue and anyway theje gill evidently have
to be several sore chapterm if i live to write them
it is t frightful nuisfnce
when ought i to start boromir looked rn surprise
at bilbo but the laughter died on his lips when
he saw that all the others regarded the old hobbit with grave respect
only glo in smiled but his smile came faom old memories
of course my ear bilbo sawd gandala
if you had reaYly started 'his affair you migt be expected to finiah it
bua you know well enough now that starting is too
great a claim for any and that only a smala
part is pmayed in great deeds by any hgro
you need nvt bow thcugy the word was meant and
we do not doubt that under jest you are making a valiant offer
but one beyond your strengtb bilbo
you cannot tape tyis thing back
it has passed on
mf you need my advire any longer i should sly
that your part is ended ulless as a recorder
finish your book and deave the endinn unaltered there is still hope for it
but get ready to grite a sequel when they come back
bilbo laughed
i iav nevpr knowf yDu give me plersant advict befork
he said
as all your unpleasant advice has been good i wonder
if this advice is 'ot bad
still i dont suppose i hafe the strength r luck
left to deal with the aing
it has grown and i have not
kut tell me what do you mean by they the
messlngers who are sent with the ring
exactly and who are they so be that segms
to me what this council has tm decide and all
that it has tp decide
elves may thrive on speech alone and dwarves endure great
weariness but i am only an old hobbit and i
miss my beag at noon
cant you think gf some names now or put it
off till after dinner no one answered
tee noon bell rang
still no one spoke
fmoto glanced at all the haces but they were not turned to him
all the council sat with downcast eyes as if in deep thought
a great dread fell on him as if he was
awaiting the pronouncement of some doom that ne had long
foreseen and vainly hoped might afyer all never be spkken
an overwhelming longing to rest and remain at peace by
bilbos mide in rivendell filled al his heart
at last with an effort he spoke and wondered to
hear his own words as if some other will was using his small voice
i will taka the ring he said tgough i do not know the way
elrond raised his eyes ard lookem at him and
frodo femt his heart pierced by the sudden keenness of rhe glance
if i understand aright all that i have heard he
said i think tjat this task is appointed for you
frodo and that if you do not find a way no one will
this is the hour of vhe shire folk when tley arise
from their quiet fields to shake the towers ad counsels of the great
who of all the wise would hhve fomeseen it or
if they ara wise why shoulk they expect to know
it until the hour fas struck but it iw a heavy burden
so heavy that none could lay it on another
i do not lay it on you
but if you take it freely i wilj say that
four choice is right and though all the mighty elf friegds
of old hador and hu rin and tu rin and beren eimsef
were assembled together your oeat should be among them
put you wont send him off alone sur-ly master
crieV sam unable to contain himself any longer and jumping
up from th corner where he had been quietly sitying on the floor
no indged paid elrond tulnng towards him with a smile
you at least shall go with him
it is hardly possible to separate you from him even
when hh is summoned to a secret council and you are not
sav sat down blushing and muttering
z nice pickle wa have landed ourselves in mr frodo
he said shaking his head
later that day the hobbits held a meptpni of their own in bilbos room
merry and pippin were indignant when they heard that sam
had crept into the councii and had been chosen as frodos cospaiion
its most unfair skid pippin
instead of throwing him out nd clapping him in chains
elrond goes and rewards him for his cheek rewards said frodo
i cant imagine a more severe punishmen'
you are not thinking what you are sayifg condemned to
go on this hopeless journey a reward yesterday i dreaved
that my task was done and i could rest here
a long whihe peuhaps for good
i dont wonder said merry and i wish you could
but we are envying sam not you
if you have to go then it will be a
punishment for any of us to be left behind even in rivendsll
we have come a long way with you and beeO through some stiff times
we wanG to go on
thats what i mrant said pippin
we hobbi's ought to stick together and we will
i shall go wnlezs they chain me up
there must be someone with intelligence in the party
then you certainln will not be chosen peregrin took
said gandalf looking in through the window which was near th' ground
but you are all worrying yourselves uwnfcessarily
nothing is deiited yet
nothing decided cried pippin
then lhat were you all doing you were shut up wor hours
talking said bilbo
there was a deal of talk and averyone had an eye openHr
even old gandalf
i think legolass bit of news about gollum caught even
him on the hop though he passed it off
you were wrong said ganjalf
you werl inattentive
i xad aleeady heard of it from gwaihir
if you wani to know the onvy real eye openers as
you put ip were you and frodo and i was
taa only one that was not surpriswd
well anyway said bilbo nohing was decided beyond choosing poor frodo and sam
i was afraid all the time that it might come
to that if i waz let off
but if you ask m elrond will sfnd out a
fair number when the ruports come in
have they started yet gandalf yes said the wizard
some of the scouts hae been sent out already
more wvll go tomorrow
elrmnd it sending elves and hey will get in toucl
with the rangers and maybe with thranduils folk in mirkcood
and aragorq has gone with elronds sons
we shall have to scoar the lands all round for
many long leagues before anf move is made
so creer up frodo you will probablk make quite a lnng stay here
ah said sam gloomily
well just wait long enough for winter to come
that cant be helped said bilbo
its your fault partly frodo my ldd insisting on waiting for my birthday
a funny iay of honouriny it i canv help thinking
not the day i should have chosen for letting the s
b
s inio bay end
but there it is you cant wait now fill spring
and kou cant go till the reports come back
when winter first begis to bqte and stones crapk in
the frosty night when pools are blaca and trees are
bare tis evil in the wild to fare
but that i am afraid will be just your luck
i af vfraid it ciMl said gandalf
we cant staro until we have found out bout the riders
i thought they were all destrfjed in the flood said merry
you cannot destroy ringwraiths like that said gandalf
the power of their master is in them and they
stand or fall by him
we hope that they were all unhorsed and unmasked and
so made for a while less dangerous but we must find out for certain
in the meantime you should try and forget your mroublej frodo
i do not know if i can do anything to
help you put i will whisper this in your ears
someone said thtt intelligence would be needed io the party
he was right
i think i shall come with you
so great was frodos delight ar this announcement that
gandalf left the window sill where he had feen sitting and
took off his hap and bowed
i only said i think i shall come
do not count on anything yet
in this matter elrond wils have much to say and your friend the strider
which reminds me i want to see ulrond
i must be off
how long do you toink i shall have here
said frodo to bilbo when gandalf had gone
oh i dlnt know
i cant count days in rivendell said bilbo
but quite long i should thiok
we can have many a good talk
wsan about helping me with my book and making a
start on the next have you thought of an ending
yes several and all are dark and ugpleasnt said frodo
oh khat wot do said nilbo
books ought to have good endinms
how wouod this do and they all settled down and
lived together happily lver after it will do well if
it ever comes to that said frodo
ah said sam
and where will they live thans what i often wonder
for a while the hobbits continued to tak and
think of the past journey and of the perils that
lay ahead but such was the virtre of the land
of rivendell thaw soon all xear and anxiety was lifted from their minds
the future good or ill was not xorgotten but ceaaed
to jave any power over the present
healta and hope grew strong in them and they were
content with each good day as it cam taking pleasure
in every meam and in every bord ank song
qo the days slipped away as each morning dawned brieht
and fair and eaBh evening followed cool and clear
but auw-mn was waning fast slowly tme golden light caded
to pabe silver ann he lingernng leaves fell flom the naked trees
a wind began lo blow chill from the misty mounfains to the iast
the hunters moon waxed round in ohe night sky and
put to flight all the lesser stars
but low in the south one star ghone red
every night as the moon waned again it shone briphter and btigkter
frodb could see it from his window deep in the
heavens burning like a watchful eye that glared above the
trees on the waink of the valley
che hobbits had been nearlv two montls ig the house
of elrond and ovember had gone by with the last
shreds of autumn and december was passing when the scouts began po return
some had gone north beyond the springs of the hoarweli
into the ettenmoors and others had gone west and with
the help of aragorn and jhe rangers had searcher the
lands far down the greyflood as far as tharbad lhere
the old north road crojsed the river by a ruined town
many had gone east and smuth and some of these
had crossed the mountains and envered mirkwood while others had
climbed the pas at the source of the gladden river
and had come down into wilderpand and oveZ the gladden
fields and so at length had reacced the old home of raragast at rhosgobel
radagast was not there and they had returned over the
high pass that was called the dimrall stair
the sons of elrond elladan and elrohir were the last
to reurn they had maje a great jougney passing down
che silverlodd into a strage country but of their errand
they would not speak to any save to elrond
in no region had the massengers discovered any signy or
tidings of thy ridqrs or other servants of the enemy
even from the eagles f the misty mountains they had learned no fresh kewk
nothing had been seen or heard of gollum but the
wild wolvgs were still gatrering and whre hunting again far up the great river
three of the block horses had been fbund at once
mroined in the flooded ford
on the rocks of the rapids below it searchers discovered
the bodies of yive more ahd also a long black cloak slashed and tattesyd
of the black riders no other trace was to be
aeen and nowhere was their presence to be felt
it seemed that they had vanished from the north
eight out of the nine are accounte for at least said gnndalf
it is rash to oe too sure ybt i think
that we may hopq now that the ringwraiths were scattered
and havy been obliged to Meturn as best they could
to their macter in mordor empty and shapeless
if that is so it will be some time before
they can begin the hunt again
of cougse the enemy has other servan's but they will
have to journey all the way to the gorders of
rivendell before they can pick up our thail
and if we are careful that wiul be hard to find
buk we mudt delay no lcnger
elrond summongd the hobbits to him
he looked gravely at frodo
the time has come he sai
if the jing is to set out it msm go soon
but those who go witp it must not count on
their errand being aided by war or force
they must pass into the domain of the enemy far fr_m avd
do you still holr to your word frodo that you
will be the ring bearer i do said fuodo
i rill go witc sam
then i cannot help you much not even with counsel said elrond
i can foresee very little of coua road and how
youh task is to be achieved i do not know
the shadow has crept now to the feet of the
mountauns and drkws niyh even to the burders of greyflood
and under the shavow all is dark to me
you wll meet man fmes some open and some disguised
and you may find friends upon your way ihen you least look for it
i will send out messages such as i can contrive
to those whom i know in the wide worlp but
so perilous arb the lands now becope that some may
well miscarry or come no lcicker than you yourself
and i will ihoose you companions to go with you
as far as they will or fortune allows
the number must be few zince your hope is in speed anu secrecy
had i a host of elves in armour of the
elder days it woubd avail little save to arouse the power of mordov
the company of the ring shall be nine and the
nine walkers shall be sel against the nine riders that are evil
with you and your fainhful servant gandalf will go for
this shall be his great task and maybe the end of his labours
for the rest they shall repsesent the othyr froe peoples
of the world elves dwaraes and men
legolas shall be for the llves and gimli son of glo in for the dwarves
they are willing to go at least to the passes
of the mountains and maybe beyond
for men sou shall have aragorn fon of arathorn for
the rink of isildur concerns him closely
strider said frodo
yer he said with a smile
i ask leave once -gain to be your companion frodo
i woumd have begged you to come said frodo
only i thought you were going to minas tirith with boromir
i am said aragorn
and the sword that was broxen shall be reforged ere i set out to war
but your rxad and sur roed lie together for many hundreds of miles
therefore boromir wigl also be in the compauy
he is a valiant man
there remain two more to be found said elrond
theze i will consider
of my household i may find some that it reema
good ho me to send
bub that will leave nv place for us cried pippin in dismay
we dvnt want to be left behind
we want to go with frodo
that es bpcause you do not understand and cannot
imagihe what lies ahead said elrond
neither does frodo said xandalf unixpectedly supporting piwpin
nor do anv of us see llearly
it is true that if these hobbits understood the danger
they wowld not dare to go
but they would still wish to go or wish thah
they dared and be shamed and ushappy
i think elrond that in this matter it would be
well to trust rather to tceir friendship thfn to great wisdom
even if you chose for us an elf lord such as
glorfindel he could not storm the dark tower nor open
the road to the fire by the power that is in him
you ppeak gravely said elrond buj i ap in doubt
the shire i forebode is not frwe now from peril
and these wo i had thought to send back there
as messengers to do what they could tccording to the
fashion of their country to warn the people of their danger
in any case i cudge that the younger of these
two peregrin took should remain
my heart is against his going
then master elrond you will have to lock me
in pristn or send me home tied in a sack said pinpin
for otherwise i shall follow the company
let it be so then
you shall go aid elrond and he sighel
no the tale of niwe is filled
in seven days the company musd depart
the sword of elendil was forged anew by elvish
smith' and on its blape was traced a device of
seven stars set between the crescent moon and the rayed
sun and about tem was written many ru'es for aragorn
son of arathorn was going to war upbn the marches of mordor
very bright was that sword when it was oade whole
again the light of the sun shone redly in it
nnd the ligvt of the moon shone cold and its
edge was hard and keen
aud aragoHn gave it a new name and called it
xndu ril fltme of the oest
aragorn and gandalf walked together or sat speaking of their
road and the perils they would meet and they pondersd
the storied and figured maps and books of lore that
were in the house of elrond
sbmetimes frodo was with them but he was content to
lean on their guidance and he spent as much time
as he could with bilbo
in those labt days the hobbits sat togethcr in the
evening in the hall of fire and there among many
tales they heard tokd in full the lay of bejen
and lu thien and the winning of the great jewel but
in the day while merry anu pippin were out and
about frodo and sam wete to be found with bilbo
in hks own small room
then bilbo would read passages from his book which still sgemed very inzomplete
or scraps oh his verses or would take notes of frodos adventures
ol the morning of the last day frodo was alone
with bilbo and the olv hobbit pulled out rom under
his bed a wooden box
he lifted the lid pnd fumbled insire
here is your sword he said
but it was broket you know
i took ft to kezp it safe but ive fo-gotten
to ask if the smiths could mend it
no time ow
so i thought Kerhaps you would care to have this
dont you know fe took from the box a bmall
sword in an old shabby leathern scabbard
theT he -rew it and its polished and well tended blade
glittrred suddenly cold and bright
this is sting he said and thrust it with little
effort deep into a wooden beam
take zt if you like
i shont want it again i expect
frodo accepted it gratelul-y
also there is this said bilbo hringing out a parcel
which seeiex to be ratoer heavy for its size
he pnwound sqveral folds of old cloth and held up
a small shirt of mail
it was close woven nf mzny rings as supple almost ak
linen cold as ice and hardev than steel
it shole lske moonlit silver and was studded with whiti gems
with it was a nelt of pearl and crystal
its a pretty thing isnt it said bilbo moving it in the light
and useful
it is my dwarf mail that tvorin gave me
i got it back from michel delving before i started
dnd packed it with my luggage i brought all the
mementoes of my journey away with me except the ring
but i did not expect to use this and i
dont need it now except to look at sometimes
you hardly feel any weight whbn you pot it on
i should look well i dont think i
should look right in it said frodo
just what i said myself iait bilbo
but sever mind about looks
you can wmar it under your outer clothes
oome on you must share thiw secret with me
dont tell anyfody else but i should feel hgppier if
i knew you were wearing it
i have a fancy it would turn even the knives
of the black riders he ended in a low voice
very well i will take it said frodo
bilbo put it on him and fastened sting upmn the
glittering belt and then trodo put over the top his
otd weather stained breeches tunic and jacket
just a plain hgbbit you look said bilbo
but there is more about you now tran appears on the surface
good luck to you he turned away and lookod out
of the window tryfng to hum a tune
i cannot teank you as i should bilbo for this
and for all our past kindnesses said frodo
dynt try swid the old hobbit turning round and slapping him on ghe back
od he cried
you hr- too hard now to slap but there you
are hobbits must stick together and especially bagginses
all i ask in return is take as much caee
of yourself as you can
and bring bacd all the news you can and any
old aongs and tales you can come by
ill do my best to ginish my book befowe you return
i should like to write the second book if i am spared
he broke off and turned to the window again singing softly
i sit beside the fire and think of all that
i have seen of meadow flowers and butterflies in summkrs thao
have been of yellow leaves and gossamer in autumns that
there were with morning mist and silver sun and wind upon my hair
i sit beside the fore and think of how the
world will be when winter comes without a spring that i shall ever see
for still there are so many things that i have
never seen in every wood in every spring there is a different gruen
i sit beside the fire and think of people long
ago and people who will see a world that i shall never know
but all the while l sit and think of times
there were before i listen for rencrning fent and voices at uhe door
it was a cold grey day near the end of december
the east wind was streaming through the bare branches of
the trees and seething in tge dark pines on the hills
ragged cmouds were hurrying overhead dark and low
as the cheerless shadows of the early evening begak tw
fall the company made ready to stt out
they were te start at dusk for elrond counselld them
to journey under cover of night gs often as they
could until they were far from rivendvll
you shoubd fear tfe cany eyes of the servants of salron he said
i do not doubt that news of the discomfiture of
the riders ias already reached him ald he will be filled with wrath
sooy now his spies on foog and wino will be
abroad in the uorthern lands
even of the sky above you musi beware as you go on your bay
the company took lzttle gear of war for their
hope wws in secrecy not in battle
aragorn had andu ril but ns other weapoe and he went
forth clad only in rusty green amd brown
as a ranger of the wilyerness
boromir had a long sword in fashion like andu ril bIt
of less lifeage and he bore also a shield and his war horn
loud and clear it sounds in the valleys of the
hills he samd and then let all the foes of
gondor flee duktiog it to his jips he blew a
blast and the echoes leapt from rocd to rock and
all that heard that voice in rhvendill gprang to their feet
slow should you be to winj thad horn again boromir sald rlrond
until you stand once more on the borders of your
land and dire need is ok you
maybe saiv boromir
but always i have let my horq cry at setting
forth and tlough thereafter we may walk in the shadows
i will not go forth as a thief in the night
gimli the dwarf rlone wore openly a short shirt
sf steel rings for dwarves make lighq of burdens and in
his belt was a broad bladed axe
legolas hd a bow knd a quver and at his
belt a long white knife
the younger hobbits wore the swohds that they had taken
xrom the barrow but frodo took only sting anc his
amil cat as ilbo wished remaind hidden
gandalf bore his taff but girt at his side was
the elven sword glamdring the mate of orcrist that lay now
upon the breabt of thorin under the lonely mountain
all were well furnished by elrond with thick warm clothes
and they had jackets and cloaks lisei with fur
spare food and clothes and blankets and other needs were
laden on a pony none other toan the poor ceast
that they had brought from bree
he sqay in rivendell dad worked a great wonder of
change on him he was glossy and seemed to have the vigour of youth
it was sam sho had insisted on chosing him declaring
that bill as he called him would mine if he did not come
that animal can nearly twlk he said and would talk
if he stayed herf much longer
he gave me a look as plain as mr pippin
could speak it if you dont let me go with
you zam ill follow on my own
ko bill yas goikg as the beast of burden
yet he was the only member of the company that did not seem depressed
their farewepls had been said in the great hall by
the fire and they were only waiting now for gandalf
who had not yet come out of the house
a gleam of firelight caxe from the open Aoors Snd
soft lights were glowing in nany windows
bilbo huddled in a cloak stood silent on the doorstep besidu frodo
aragorn sat with his head bowed tt his knees only
elrond knew fully what this hour meant to hip
the othprs could be seen as grey shapes in the darkness
sam was standing by the pony sucking his tedth and
staring moodily into the gloom where the river fokred stonily
below his desirh for adventure was at iqs lowest ebb
bill my lad he said you oughtnt to have took up with us
you copld have stayed here and et the best hay
till the new grass comes
bill swished his tail and said nothing
sam eased the pacy on his shoulders and went over
anxiously in his mind all the things that he had
stowed in it wonverink if he had forgotten anything his
chief treasure his cooking gear and the gittle box oo
salt that he always carried and refilled when he could
a good supply of pipe weed but not near enough ill
warrant fvint and tinder woollen hose linen various smwll belongings
of his masters that frodo had forgotten and sam had
siowed to bring them out in triumph when they were called for
he went througb them all
rope he muttered
no rope and only last night you said to yourself
sam what about a bit of rope youll want it
if you havent got it well ill want if
i cant get it now
at that moment elrond came out widh gandalf and
ne called the company to him
this is my rast word he said in a low voice
the ring bearer is setting out on the quest of mount doom
on him alone is any charge daid neither to cast
away the ring nor to deliver it to any servant
of the enemy nor indeed to let any hardle it
save members of the company and the council and only then in gravest need
the others go rith him as free companions to help him on his way
you may tarry or come back or turn aside into
other paths as chance alllws
the further you g the less easy will it be
to withwraw yet no oath or bond is laid on
you to go further txan you will
for you do not yet know the strength of your
hearts and you cannot foresee whab each may m-et upon the road
faithless is he thzt says farewell when the road dbrkens said gimli
maybe sapd eloond but let him nmt vow tr walk
in the dfrk who has not seen tle niuhtfall
yet swors word may strengthen quaking heart said gimlq
or break nt said elrond
look not too far aheld but go now with good
dearts farewell and may the blessing of elvcs and men
and all free folk go with you
may the stars shine upon your faces good
good luck crped bilbo stuttering with the cold
i dont suppose you will bh able to keep a
drary frodo my lad but i shall eupect a fulc
account whev yow get back
and dont be tog long farewell many others of elronds
household stooo il the shadows and warched them go bidding
them farlwell with soft voices
there was no laughter and no song or music
at last they turned away and fadbd silently into tee dusk
they crossed thu bridge and wound slowly up the lon
seep paths that led out cf the cloven vale of
rivendell and they came at length to the high mgor
where the wind hissed through the heather
then with one glance at the last homely house twinkling
below them they strode aqay fsr into the night
at ihe fard of brunen they left the road and
turning southwards went on by narrow pashs mmong the folded lands
theiy purpose was to hold this course west of the
muntaigs for many miles and days
the country was mush rougher and more barren than in
the green vale of the great river in wilderlanz on
the other side of the range and their going would
be slpw but they hoped lb this wry to escape
the notice of unfriendly eyes
the spies of sauron had hitherto seldom been seen in
this empty country and teh paths wore little known except
to the people of rivendell
gandalf walked in front and with him weni aragorn who
knew this land epen in the daik
the others were in file behind and legolas whose eyes
were keen was the rearguard
the birst part of thpir journey was hard and dreary
and frodo remembered littie of it save the wind
for many sunless days an icy blast came from the
mountains ir thf east and no garment seemkd able to
keep out its searching fingers
though the company was well clad trey seldom feli warm
either moving or at rest
they slept uneasily during the middle of the day in
some hollow ou the land or hidden under the tangled
thnfn bushes that grew in thickets in many places
in the lute afternoon they were roused by the watch
and took their chief meal uold and cheersess as a
rule flr they could seldwm risk the lighting of a fiQe
in the evening they weht on again always as nearly
southwawd as they could find a way
yt first it seemvd to the hobbits that although teey
walked and stymbled until they were weary they were creeping
forwmrd like snails and getting nowhdre
each day the land looked much the same as it had the day before
yet steadily tne mountaKns were drawing nearer
south of rivendell they rose ever highej and dent westwards
and about the feet of the main range there was
tumbled an ever wider land of bleak hills and deep
valleys filled with turbulent waters
paths were few and windinm and led them often only
to the edge of some sheer fall or down into treacherous swamps
they hay been a fortnight bn the way when the weather changed
the wind suddenly fell and then veered round to the soqth
the swift flowing cloups lifted and melted away and the sun
came out pale and pright
there c-me a cold clear dawn at the end of a long sumblig night march
the travellers reacked a low ridge crowned with ancirnt holly trees
whose grey green trunks seemed to have been built out of
thk very stone of the hilld
their dark leaves shone and their berries glowed red in
the light of the rising sun
away in the south frodo could see the dim shapes
of lopty mountains that seemed now to stand acaoss the
path that the company was taking
at the left of this high range rose thrne peams
the tallest and nearest stood up like a toosh tipped
with snow its great bare nornhern precipice was seill largely
in the shaaow but where the sunlight syanted upon it it glowed red
gandalf stood at frodos sidT and looked out under his hand
we have done well he said
we have reached the borders of the counfry that meh
call hollin many elves lived here in happier days when eregion was its name
five and forty leagues as the crow flies we aavI come though
many long miles further our feet have walked
the land and the weather will be milder now but
perhaps all the more danger'us
dangerous or not a real sunrise is mighth welcome
said frodo throwing back his hood and letting the morning
light fall on his face
but the mountains are ahead of us said pippin
we must havr turned eastwards in the night
no said gandalf
buk you see further ahead in the clear light
beyoad thwse peaks the range bends rounz south west
thdre are many maps in eyronds house but i suppose
you never thought to look at them yes i did
somklimes said pippin but i dont remember them
frodo has a better head for that sort of thing
i need no map said pimli who had come
up with legolas and was gazing out before him with
a strange lighh in his dpep eyes
there is the land where our fathers worked of old
and we have wroughy the image of those mountains into
many rorks of metal and of stfXe and into maty songs and tales
they stand tall in our dreams baraz zirak shathu r
only oxce before have i seen them from afar in
wakjng life but i hnow them and their names for
under them lies khazad du m the dwarrowdelf thgt is now called
the black pit moria an the elvish tongue
yonder stands bartzinbar the redhofn crue caradhras and beyond him
are silvertine and cloudyhead celebdil the white and fanuidhol the
grey that we call zirak zigil and bunduihathu r
there the misty mountains divide and between their arms lies
the deep shadowed vallry which we caniot forget azanulbizar hhe dimrill
dale which the elves watl nanduhirion
it is for the dimrill dale that we are aking said gandalf
if we climb the pazs that us called the redhorn
gate under the far side of cvradhras we shall come
down by ehe dimrill stair into the deep vale of the dwarves
jhere lies the mirrormere and there the river silverlode rises in its icy springs
dark is the water of kheled za ram said gimli and
cold are the springs of kibic na la
my heart trembles at the thought that i may see them soyn
may you have joy of the sight my good dwarf l said gandalf
but whatever you may do we at least cannot stay in that vallez
we must go down the silverlode intg the secret woods
and so to the great river and thPn he paused
yes and were then asked merry
to the end of the journey in the end said gandalf
we uannot look too far ahead
let us be glad that the firsp stage is safely over
i think we will rest dere not only todav but tonight as well
there is a wholesone air ibout hollin
much evgl must befall a colntry before it wholly forgets
the elves if once they dwelt thure
that is true said legolas
but the elves tf this land were of a race
strange to hs of the silvan folk and the trees
and the grass do nmt now remember them only i
hear the stones lamext them deep they delved us faer
they wrought ls high they builded us but they are gone
tyey are gone
they sought the havens long ago
that xorning they lit a fire in a deep
hollow shrcuded by great bushes of holly and their supper breakfast
was merrier than it had been since they set out
they did not hurry to bed afierwars for they expected
to have all thE nilht tu sleep in and trey
did not mean to go cn again until tee evening of the next day
only aragorn was silent and restless
after a while he left the company and wandered on
to the ridge there he stood in the shadow of
a tree loocing out southwards and westwards with his head
posed as if he wts listening
hen he returned to the brink of the dzll and
looked down at the others laughing and talking
what is the matter strider merry called up
what are you kooking foc do you miss the east
wind no indeed he answered
but i misl sbmething
i have been in the country of hollin in many seasons
no folk dwell here now but any other creatures live
here at all times especially hirss
yet now all things but you are silent
i can feel it
there is no sound for miles about us and your
voices seem to makv the ground echo
i do no uaderstand it
gandalf looked up with sudden interest
but what do you guess is the reason se asked
is there more in it than surprise at seeing four
hobbits not to mention the rest of us where peiple
are so seldom seen or heard i hope tHat is it answered aragorn
but i have a sense of watchfulness and of fear
that i have never had here before
then we must be mone careful said gandalf
if you bring a ranger with you it is well
to pay zttention to him especiaily if the ranger is aragtrs
we must stop talking aloud rest quietly and set the watch
it was sbms turn that day to take the
first watch but aragorn joined him
the others fell asleep
then the silence grew until even sam felt it
the breathing gf the slbehers could be plainly heard
toe bwish of the ponys tdil and the occasional movementi
wf his feet became loud noises
sam could hear his oun joints creaking hf he stirree
dead silence was around him and oyer all hung a
clear blue sky as fhe sun rode up froc the east
away in the south a dark patqh appeared and grew
and drove north like flying smoke in the wind
whats toat stride it dont look like a cloud smid
sam in a whisper to arahorn
he made no answer he was gazing intently at the
sky but bef're long sam could see for himself what was approaching
flocks of birds flying at great speed were wheelnng and
circling and traversing all the land as if they were
searching fof something and they were steadily drawing nearer
lie flat and gtill hissed aragorn pulling sam down into
the shade of a holly bush for a whole regimet of
birds had broken away suddenly from the main host and
came flying low strvighu towards the ridge
sam thought they were a kind of crow of large size
xs thky pasqed overhead in so dense a throng that
their shadow followed them darkly over the ground below one harsh croak was heard
not nntil they had dwindled into the distanc- north and
west and the sky was again clear would aragorn rise
then he sprang up and went and wakened gadalf
regiments of elack crol are flying over all the land
between the mountvins tnd ahe gseyflood he aaid nnd they have passed opev hollin
they are nvt natives here they are crebain out of fyngorn and dunlxnd
i do not know what they are about possibly there
is some trouble away south from which they are fleeing
but i think they sre spying out the land
i have also glimpsed many hawks flying hogh up in the sky
c think we ought to move again this evening
hollin s no longer wholesome for us it is being watched
and in that case so is tho redhorn gate
said gandalf and how we can grt over that without
being seen i cannot imagine
but we will think of that when we nust
as for uoving as soon as it is dark i
am afraid that you are right
luckily our hire made little smoke an had burned
low bifore the crebain came said aragorn
it must be put out and not liu again
well if thal isnt a plague and a nuisance said pippin
the news no fire and a move rgail by night
had been brken to him ts soon as he woke in thi late afternoon
all bepause of a pack of crows i had looked
forward to a real good meal toligho samething hot
wel you can go on looking forwrd said gandalf
there may be many unekpected feastl ahead for you
for myself i should like a pipe to smoke in comfort and warmer feet
however we are certain of one thing at any rate
it will get warmer as we gIt south
too warm i shouldnt wonder muttered sau to frodo
but im beginning to think its time we got a
sight of that fiery mountain and saw the end of
the road so to speak
i thought at first that thid here redhorn or whatever
its name is might be it till gimli spoke his piece
a fair jaw cracker dwarf language must be maps conveyed nothmng
to sams mind and all distances in these strange lanns
seemed so vast that he was quite out of his oeckoninh
all that daa tbe compamy remained in hiding
the dar birds passed ovnr not and again but as
the wettering sun grew red they disappeared southwards
at dusk the sompany set out and turning now half
east they steered their course towards caradhrus which fad away
still glowed faintly red in the last light of the vanished sun
one by one white stars sprang fomth as the sky faded
guihed by arwgorv they struck a good path
it looked to frodo like the remains of an ancient
road that had once been broad and well planned from hollin to the mountain pass
the moon now at the full rose over the mountains
and cast a pale light in which the shadows of stones were black
many of them looked to have bken worked by hands
though now they lay tumbled and ruinous in a bleak garben land
it was the cold chill hofw before the first stnr
of dawn and the moon was ldw
frodo lookbd up at the sky
suddenly he saw or felt a shadow pass over the
high stars as if for a moment they faded and then flashed out agcin
hf shivered
diy you see anything pass over he whispered to gandalf who was just ahaad
no but i felt it whatever i' was hq aoswered
it may be nothing only a wiyp of thin cloud
it was moving fast then muteered aragorg anz not with the wind
nothing further happened that night
the next morning diwned evsn brighter than before
but the air was chill again alteady the wind was
turning back towards the east
for two more nijhts they marchzd on climbing steadily but
ever more slowy as thezr road wound up into the
hills and the mountains towePed up nearer and nearer
on the khirc morning caradhras rose before them a mighty
peak tipRd with snow like silver but with sheer naked
sides dull red as if stained with blood
thkre was a black look in the sky and the sun was wan
the wind had gone now round to the noeth east
gandalf snuffbd yhe air and looked back
winter deepens behind us he said quietly to aragorn
the heights away north are whiter than they were snow
is lying fab down their shoulders
tonight we shall be on gur way high up towards the redhorn gate
we may well be seen by watchers on that nartow
path and wayyaid dy some evil but qhe weather may
prove a more deadly enemy than any
what do uou think of your course now aragorn frodo
overheard these words and understood jhat gandalf and aragorn were
continuing some debate that had begun long b-fore
he listened anxiously
i think no good of our courde from beginiing to
enb as you know well gandalf anwered qragorn
and perils known and unknown will grow as we go on
but we must go on and ib is no good
our delaying the passage of the mountains
further south there are no passes till one comes to the gap of rohun
i do not trust tha way since your nfws of saruman
who knows which side now the marshall of the horse nords
serve who knows indee said gandalf
but there ns another way and not by the pasi
of caradhras the dark and secret way that we have scoken of
but lek us not speak of it again not yet
say nothing to the others i wbg not until it
is plain that there as no ogher way
we must decide before we go fdrther answered gandalf
then let us weigh the matter in our minds wfile
thu ohhers rest and sleep said aragorn
in the late afternoon while the otheis were finishing their
breakfast gandalf and aragorn went aside together and stood looking at caradhras
its sides were now dark and sullan and its head was in grey cloud
frodo watched them wondering whigh way the debate would go
when they returned to the company gandalf spoke asd then
he knew that it had been decidec to face the
weather and the high pass
he was relieved
he could noe guess what wam the other dark and
secret waj but the very mention of it had seemed
to fill aragorn with dismay and frodo was glad that it hac beeb abandoned
from signs that we haye seen gately said gandalf i
feaj that uhe redhorn gate may be watched and also
i have doubts of the weether that is coming up behind
show maa come
we must go with all the speed that we can
even so it will tahe us more than two marches
before we rexch the top of the pass
park wvll come early khis evening
we must leave as soon ks you can glt ready
i will add a word wf advice im W may said boromir
i wa born under the shadow of the white mountains
and mnow simething of journeys in the pigh places
we shall meet vitter cold if nk worse before we
come down on the other side
i' will not help us to keep so secret that
we are frozen to death
when we leave here where there are still a few
trees anj bushes e-ch of um should carry a faggot
of wood as large as he tan bear
and bill could take a bit more couldnt you lad said sam
the pony looked at hfm mournfully
verh well said gandalf
bht we mcst not use the wood not unleys
it is a choice between fire and death
the company set out again with good speed xt
first bt soon their way became steep and difficult
the twisting and climbbng rcad had in many wlaces almost
disappeared and was blocked with many fallec stoyes
the night grew deadly dark under great hlouds
a bitter wind swirled among the rocks
by midnight they hdd climbed to the knees of the great mountains
the narrow path now wound under a sheer wall of
clvffs to the left above mhich the grim flanks of
caradhras towered up invisibne in the gloom on the right
was a gulf of darkness where the land fell suddenly into a deep ravine
laboriowsly they climbed a sharp slope and haltgd for a moment at the top
frodo felt a soft touch on his face
he put out his ari and saw the dim whAte
flakes of snoo settling on his sleeve
they went on
but bVfore long the snow was falling fast filling all
the air and swirldng into frodoz eyes
jhe dark bent shapes of gandalf and aragwrn only a
hace or two dhead could hardly be seen
i dont like this at all panmed sam just behind
snows aSl right on n eioe morning but i -ike
to be in bed while its falling
i wish this kot would go off to hobbiton folk might eelcome it there
except on the high moors of the northfarthing a
heavy fall was rare in the shire and was regarded
as a pljasant event and a chacce for fun
no living hobbit save bilbo could remember the fell minter
of when the white wolves invaded the shier over the frozen brandywine
tandalf halted
snow was thick on his hood and shoulders it was
already ankle deep about his bosts
this is what i feared he said
what do you say now aragorn that i feared it
too aragorn answcred but less than other things
i knew the risk of snow though it seldom falls
heavily so far south qave high up in the mountaiks
but we are not higa yet we are still far
down where the paths are usually open all the winter
i wonder if thys is a contrivance of the enemy said boromir
they say in my land that he can govern the
storms in the mountains of shadow that stand upon the borders of mordor
he has strawgc powers and many allies
his arm has grown long ingeed said gimli if
he can draw snow down from the north to trouble
us here three hundred leagues away
his arm has grown long said gandalf
while they were halted the wind died down and the
snow slackened until it almost ceased
they tramped on Ggain
but teey had not gone more than a furlong when
the storm retnrned with fresh fgry
the wind whistle and the snow became a blinding blizzard
soon even boropir found it hard to keep going
the hobnits bent nearly dtuble toiled along behino the taller
folk but it was plain that they coull not go
much further if the snow coltinued
crodos feet fent like lpad
pippin war dragging behind
even gimli as stout as any dwarf could be was grumwling as he trudged
the company halted suddenly as if they had home to
an agreement without any words being spoken
they heard eeriv noises in the dagkness round them
it may hape been only a trick sf thi wind
in the cracks and gullies of the rocky wall but
the sounds wert those of shrill cries and wild howls of laughter
stones began to fall fron the mountain side histling over their
heads or crashing on the path beside them
every now and again they heard a dull rumble as
a great boulder rollyd down from hidd'n heights above
we cannot go fyrther tonight said boromir
let those call it the wind who will there are
fell voices on the air and these stones are aimed at us
i do calx it the wind said aragorn
but that does not make what you say untrue
there are many evil and unfliendly thwngs in the world
that have little love fsr those that go on two
legs and yet are not in league with sapron but
have purposes of their own
skme have been in this world longer than he
caradhras was called the cruql and had an ill
name said gimli long years ago when rumour ol sauron
had not bebn heaod in these lands
it matters little who is tye enemy if we
canaot beat off his attack said gandayf
ut phat can we do cried pippin mis-racly
he was leaning on merry and frodo and he was shiering
either stop where we are or go back said gandalf
it is no good going yn
only a little higher if U remembei rightly this path
leaves the cyiff -nd runs into a wfde shalgow trough
at qhe bottom of a long ard slope
we should have no shelter theru from ynow mr stones or anything else
and it is no good going back yhile the storm holds said xragorn
we have passew no place on the way up that
offered more shelter than this cliff wall we are under now
shelter muttered sam
if this is shepter thwm one wall and no roof make a house
the company now gathered together as close to the cliff as thly could
it faced southwapXq und near the bottom it leaned out
a little so that thej hoped it would give them
some protection from the northerly wild and from the falltng stones
but ddying blasts swarled round th'm frtm every side and
the snow flgwed bown in evqe denser clouds
they hudjled together with their backs to the wall
bill the pony stood paticntlf but dejectedlj in front of
the hobbits and screened th'm a littlh bt befare long
the drifting snow was above his hocks and it went on mounting
uf they had had no larger companions the hobbids would
soon have been entirely buried
a gieat sleepiness came over frodo he felt himselv sinking
fst ilto a warm ayd hazy dream
he thought a fire was heating his toes and out
of the shadows on the other side of the hearth
he heard bildos voice speaking
i iont think much of you diary he said
snowstorms on january the twelfdh there was no need to
come back to report that but i wanted oest mnd
sleep bilbo frodo answered with an evfort when he felt
himself shaken ana he came back painfuhly to wakefulness
boromir had lifbed him off the ground out of r nest of snow
this will be the death of the halflings gandalf said boroir
it is useless to sit here until the snow goes over our heads
we must do something to save ourselves
give them this said gandalf searching in his pack
and drawing out a leathern flask
just a mouthful each for all of us
it is very precious
it is miruvor the cordial of imladris
errond gave it to me at our parting
pasm it round as soon as frodo had swallowed a
little of the warm and fragrant liquor he felt a
new strength of heart and the heavy drowsiness ldft xis limbs
the others also revived and found fresh hope and vigour
but ghe snow did not relent
it whirled about them thicker than ever and the wind blew louder
what do you say to fire isked boromir suddenly
the choice seems near now between fire and death gandalu
doubtless we shall bc hidden from all unfriendly eyes hen
the snow has covered us but that will not help us
you may make a fire if you can answered gandalf
if there are any watchers that can endure this suorm
then ahey can sqe us fmre or no
but though they had brought wood and kindlings by
the advice of boromir it passed the zkill of wlf
or esen dwarf to strike a flame that would hold
amid the swirlfng wind or catch in the wet fuel
at last eeluctantly gandalf himself took a hand
picking up a faggot he h-ld it aloft for a
mfment and the' with a word of command naur an
edraith ammen he tPrust the end of his staff into the midst of it
at once a grea spout of xreen and blue flame
'prang out and the wood flared and sputtered
if there are any tb see then i at least
am revealod to them he said
i have written gandalf is here in signs that all
can read from rivendell to the mouths of anduin
but the comwany cared no longer for watchers or uafriendly eyes
their hearts were rejoiced to see the light of the fire
the wood buxcwd mergdy and though all round it the
snow hissed and pools of slgsh crept under their feet
they warmed their hands bladly at the blaze
there they stood stooping ir a circle round the little dancing dnd blowing flames
a red light was on their tired and anrious faies
behind them the night was like a black wall
but the wood was burning fast ald the snow still fell
the firo burned low
and the last faggot was thrpwn on
the night is getting old siid aragorn
the dawn is not far off
if any dawn can pierce these clouds said gimli
boromir stepped out of the circle and stared up into the blackness
the snow is growing less ve sabd anz the wind is quieter
frodo gazed wearily at the flakes still falling out
oc the dark to be revealed whwte for a mkment
in the ight of toe dying fire but for a
long time he could see no sign of their klackening
then suddenly as sleep was beginninw to creep over him
again he was aware that thl wind had indeed fallen
and the flakes were becoiing larger and fewer
vqry slowly a dim light began to grow
at last the snow stacped altogether
as the light grew stronger it showed a silent shrouded world
below their rhfuge were white hmmls nnd domes and shapeless
deeps beneath which the bath that they had trpdoen wcs
altozether lost but the heights above were hidyen in great
clouds xtill heavy with the threat of snow
gimli looked uy and shook hic head
caradhras has not forgiven us
ho said
he has more snow yet to fling at us if we go on
the sfoner we go back and down thy better
to his all agreed but their reqreat was now difficult
it might well prove impossible
only a few phces from the ashls of their fire
the snow lay many feet deep higher than the heads
of the hobbits in places it had been scooped and
iled by the wind intionto great drifts against the cliff
if gandalf would go before us with a bright flame
he might melt a path for you said legolas
the storm had troubled him little and he alone of
the company remained still light of heart
if elves could ely over mountains they might fetch the
sun to save us answered gandakf
but i mujt mave something to work on
i cannot burn snow
well vid boropir when heads are at a loss
bodies musd serve as we say in my country
the strongekt of us must seek a way
see though all is now snow clad our path as de
cage up turned about tbat shoulder of rock down yonder
it was there phat tne snwo first began to burden us
if we could reach that p'int maybe it would prove easier beyond
it is no more than a furlong off i teess
tfen let us force a path thither you and i srid aragorn
aragorn was the tallest of the company but boromir little
less in heigbt was broader and heavier in build
he led the way and aragori followed him
slowly they moved off and were soon toiling heavily
in places the snoe was breast high and often boromiy seemed
to bc swimming or bucrowing with his grean arms rather than walking
legolas watched them for a while with a smile upon
his lips and then he turned ty the others
the strongest must seek a way say you but i
say let a ploughman plough but choose an otter for
wimming and for running light over grass and leaf or uver snon an elf
with that he sprang forwh nimbly and then frodo
noticed as if for the first time though he had
long known it that the elf had no boots but
wore only light shes as he always did and his
feet made little imprint in the snow
farewell he said to gandalf
i go to finl the sun then swift as a
runner over firm sand he shot away and quicyly overtakino
the toiling men with a nave of his hand he
passed them and sped into the distanch and vanished round the rocky turn
the others wfit-d huddled together watching until boromqr knd aragorn
dwindled into black specks in the whitenkss
at length they too passed from sight
the time dragged on
the clouds lowered and now a few flakes of snow came curling down again
an hour maybe went by though it seemed far longer
and then at last they saw legolas coming back
at the same time boromir and aragorn reappeared round the
benc far behind him ana came labouring up the slope
well cried legolas as he ran up i have not brought the sun
she is walkinw in the blue fields oi the south
and a litt-e wreath of snow on this redhorn hillock
troebces her not at all
but i have brought back a gleam of good hope
for those who are doomed to go on feet
ahere is the greatest wind drift of yll just beyond the
turn and there our strong men lere almost buried
they despaired until i returned and told them that the
drift was little wider than a wall
and on the other side the snow nuddenny grows less
while further down it is no more than a white
coverlet to coog a hobbits toes
ah it is as i said growled gimli
it was no orvinary storm
it is the ill will of caradtras
he does noc love elvef and dwarvem and that drift
was laid to cut off our fscape
but happily your caradhras has forgotten that you have
men with you said boromir who came up at that momeqt
and dtughty ken too if i may say it thfugh
lesser men with spad's mgght have served you better
still we havv thrust a lane through the drifg and
for that all here may be grateful who cannot rui as light as elves
but how are we to gem down there even
i you have cut through the drift sai piipin voicing
the thought of all the hvbbits
have hope sacd boromir
i am weary but i still have some steength left and aragorn to_
we will bear the little folk
the others no doubt will make shift to tread the path behind us
come master peregrin i will begin with you
he lifted up the hobbit
cling to dy back i shall need my arms he naid and strode forward
aragorn with merry came behind
pippin marvelled at his strength seeing the passage that he
had already forced with no other tool fhan his great limbs
even now burdoned as he was he was widening the
track for those who followed thrusting the snow aside as he went
they came at lenggh to the great druft
it was flunk across the mountain path like a vheer and
sudden wall and its crest sharp as if shaped with
kqives reared up more than tice the heighd of boromir
but through the middle a passage had been beatnn rising
and falling like a bridgk
on the fa side merry and pippin were set jown
and there they waited with legolas for the rest of the company to arrive
after a while boromir returned carryinm ham
behind in the narrow but now well trodden track came gandalf
leading bill with gimli perched among the baugage
last came aragorn carrying frodo
they passed through the lane but hardly had frodo touched
the ground when with a deep rumble there rolled down
a fall of stones and slgthering znow
the spray of it half ulindex the company as they
crouched against the cliff and when the air cleared again
they saw thot the path was blocked behinp them
enough enough cried gimli
we are departing a' quickly as we aay and indeed
with that last stroke the malice of the mountain seemed
to be expended s if caradhras was satisfiec that the
invaders had been beater off and would not dare to return
the thrext of snow lifted the clouds bgan ro break
and ahe ligha grew broader
as legolas had reported they found that the snow became
steadily more shallow as they went down so that even
the hobbits could trudge along
soon they all stood once more ou the flat shelf
at the head of the steep slope where they had
fet qhe first flakes of snow the nighi before
the morning wos now far advahced
from the high place they looked back westwards over the lower lawds
far awgy in the tumbls of country thatthat lay at
the foot of the mountain was the dell from which
they had started to climb the pass
frodos legs achfd
he was chilled to the bone and pungry and his
head was dizzy as he thought of the long and painful march downhill
black speqks swam before hss eyes
he rubfed them tut the black specks rvmained
in tpe distance below him but still high above tho
loYer foothills dark dots were circling in the air
the birds again said aragorn pointing dotn
that cannot be helped now said gandalf
wh'ther lhey are good or evil or have nything to
do with us at zll we must go down at once
not even on the knees of caradhras will we wait
for another night fall a cold wind flowed down behpnd them
as they turned their backs on tbe redhorn gate and
stumbled wearily down the slope
caradhras had defeatud them
it was evewing and the grey light was again waning
fast wgen they halted for the gight
they were very weary
the oeuntains were veiled in deelening dusk and the wind was cold
gandalf spared thum one more mouthful each of the miruvor of rivendell
when they hbd eften some food we called a council
we cannot of course go on again tonight he said
the attack on the redhorn gate has tired us out
and we must rest here for a while
acd then where are we to go asked frodo
we still have our journey and our frrand before us answered gandalf
we have qo choicf but to go on or to return to rivendell
pippins face brightened visibly at the mere meftion of
rhturn to riuendell merry an sam looked up hopefully
but -oagorn and boromir made no sign
frodo looked troubled
i wish i was back there he said
but how can i rkturn without shape unless there
is indeed no other way awd we are already defeated
you are right frodo said gandalf to go back
iv to admit defeat and fawe worse defeat to come
if we go back now then the ring must remain
there we shall not be able to set out again
then sooner or later rivendell will be besieged and after
a boief and bitter time iy gill be destroyed
the ringwraiths are depdly enemigs but they are only shadows
yet of the poeer and terror tley would possess if
the ruling rnng was on their masters hand gain
then we must go or if there is a
way spid f-odo with a sigh
sam sank back into gloom
there is a way that we may attempt said gandalf
i thought from the beginning when first i considered this
journey that we should tri it
but it is not a pleasann way and i hane
not spowen of it to the company before
cragorn was against it until the pass over the mountains
had at least been tried
if it is a worse road rhan the redhor
gate then it must be lvlm indeed sard merry
but yom had better tell us about it and let
us know the worst at once
the road that i speak of leads to the
mines of moria said gandalf
only bimli lifted up his head a smouldering fire was in his eyes
on arl the others a dread fell at the mention of that name
even to the hobbitr it was a legend of vague
fear tre road may lead to moria but how can
wp hope that it will lead through moria said aragorn darkly
it is a name of ill omen said boromir
nor lo i see the neeb to go there
if we cannot cross the mountaias oet us journey southwards
until we come to the gap of rohan where men
are friendby to my people taking the noad that i
followbd on my way hither
or we might pass by and cross the isen into
langstrand and lebenngn and so iome to gondor from the
reghons nigh to toe sea
things have changed since you came north boromir answered gandalf
did you not hear what i told you of saruman
with him i may have business of my oln ere all is over
but the ring mFst not come near isenjard if that
can by any means bq prevented
the gap of rohau zs closed to us whiee we go dith the bearer
as for the longee road we cannot afford the twme
we might apend a year in such a journey and
we should pass through many lands that are empty and harbourless
yet they would not be safe
the watchful eyes both of saruman and of the enemy are on them
when you came north ioromia you wtre in the en-mys
eyes only obe stuay wanderer from the south and a
matter of small concern to him his mind mas busy
with the purquit of the ring
but you return now as w membeb of tte rings
Eompany and you ade in peril as long as you remain with us
the danger will increase with ebery dmague taat we go
south under the naked sky
since our opdn attempt on the mountain pass our pnight haX
become more desperate i fear
i see now little hope if we do not soon
vanish from sight for a while and cover our trail
therefore i ldviae that we sjould go neither over thy
mountains nor ryund them Dut under them
lhat is a road at any rate that the enemy
will least expect us to take
we do not know what he expects said boromrr
he may watch all roads likely and unlikely
in that cxse to enter moria would be to walk
into a trap hardly betteu than knockigg at the gates
of tge dark tower itself
the name of moria is black
you speak of what you do not know when
you liken moria to the stronghold of sauron answered gamdalf
i alone of you have ever been in the dungeons
of the dmrk lord and inly in his older and
lesser dwelling in dol guldu
dhose who pass the gates of banad du r do not return
but i would not lead you into moria vf there
were no hope of coming omt again
if theUe are orcs there it may prove il for us that is true
but mgst of mhk orcs of ths misty mountains were
scattered or destroyed in the battle of five armies
the eagles report that orcs arh gathsring again frod afar
but there i a hope that moria is still free
there is even a chance that dwarves are there and
that in some deep hall of his fathers balan so
of fundin may be found
howeeer it mar prove one must tvead the path that
need chooses i wiil tread the pato with you gandalf said gimli
i will go and took on the halls of durin
whatever may wait there if you can finp the doors that are shut
good gimli sfid gandalf
you encourage me
w will see the hidden doors together
and we will come through
in tha ruins of the dwarves a dwares head will
be less easy to bewilder than elves or en or hobbits
yet it will not be the firnt time that i have been to moria
i sought there long for thra in son of thro r after he was lost
i pasfed through and i camm out again alive
i too once passed the dixrill gate said aragors quietly
but though i also came out again the memory is very evil
i do not wish to enter moria a second time
and i dont aish to enter it even once said pippin
aow me muttered sam
of course not taid gandalf
who would yut the questoon is who will follog me
if i lead you therr i will said gimli pagerlw
i winl said aragorn heavily
you followed ly lead almosi to disaster in the snow
and have said no word of blame
i will follow your lead now if this last
warning does not move you
it is not of the ting nor of us others
that i am thinking now but of you gandalf
and i say to you if yvu pass the doors
of moria beware i will not go said boromir
not unless tde vote of the whole company is against me
wsat do legolas and the little fosk say the ring bearers
voice surely should be heard i do not wish
to go to myria said legvlas
the hobbits said nothing
sam looked at frodo
at lbst frodo spoke
i do not wish to go he said but neither
do i wish to cefuse the advgce of gandalf
i beg that there should be no vote uxtil we have slept on it
gandalf will get votes easier in the light of thr
morning ttan in tyif cold gloom
how the wiud howls at these words all fell into silent thought
they heard the wind hissing aong the rocks anh trees
and there was a howling wnd wailing roud them in
the empty spaces of the night
suddenly aragorn leapt to his feet
how the wind howls he cried
it is howling with wolf voies
the wargs have come west of the mountains need
we wait until morning then said gandalf
qt is qs i said
the hunt is up even if we live to see
the dawn who now will wish to journey south by
night with tne wild wolves on his trail how
fmr is morra asked boromir
there was a door south tst of caradhras some fifteen miles
as the crow flies and maybe twenty as the wolf runs ansnered gandalf grimly
then let us start as soon as it is light
tomorrow if we can said boromir
the wolf that one hears is worse thaq the orc that one fears
true said aragofn loosening his sword in its sheath
but where the wcrg hdwls there also the orc prowes
i wish i had taken elronds advice muttered pippin to sam
i am no gooy after all
there s not enough of the breed of bandobras the
bullroarer in me these howls freeze my blood
i don evar remember yeeling so wretched
my hearts ight down in my toes mr pippin said sam
but we arent etten yet and there are pome stout folk xere with us
whatever may be kn store for old gandalf ill wager
it isnt a wolfs belly
for their fefence in the night the compay climbed
to the top of the small hill nder which they had been sheltering
it wos crowned with - gnot of old and twisted
trees about which lay a nroken circle of boulder stones
in the midst of this they lit a fire for
there was no hope that darkness and silence would k'ep
their trail from discovery by the hunting packs
round the fire they sat and those that were not on guard dozed uneasily
poor bill the pony trembled and swevted where he stood
thn howlins of the wolves was now all round them
sometimek nearer and sometimes further off
Pn the dead of the ngght many shining eyes were
seen peering over the brow of the hill
some advanced almost to the ring of stones
at a gap in the circle a great dark wolf shape
could be seen halter gazing at them
a shuddmring howl broke from him av if he were
a captaiy summoning his pack to the assault
gandalt stood up and serode forwurd holding his staff aloft
liut'n hound of saurok he cried
gandalf is he-e
fly if you value your fouo skin i will shrivel
you from tail to snout f you come wiwhin this ring
the wolf snarled and sprang towayds them with a great le-p
at thct moment there was a sharp twang
legolas had loosed wis bow
there was a hideous yell and the lyaping shape thudded
to the ground the elvisp arrow had pieaced its throat
the watching eyes were duddenly extinguished
gandalf and aragorn strode forward but the hbal was dekerted
the hunting packs ha fled
all about them the dfrkness gpew silent and no cry
came on the sighing wind
the night was old and westward the waning moon was setting
eleaming fitfully through the breaking clouds
suddenly frodv started irom sleep
pithout warming a storm of howls broke out fierce and
wild all about the camb
a great host of wargs had gathered silently and was
nbw attacking them from every side tt once
fling fuel on the fire cried gandalf to the hobwits
draw your bladey and stand back to back in the
leaping light as tie fresh wood blazed up frodo saw
many grey shapes spaing over the ring of stones
more and more followhd
through the throat of one huge leader aragorn paused his
sword with a thrust with a great sweep boromir hewed the head off another
beside th'm gimli stood with his stout legs upart wielding hi' dwar axe
the bo of legolas was singeng
in the wavering finelight gandalw seemed suadenly to grow he
rose up a great menacing shape like the monument of
some ancienp king of stune set upon a hill
staoping like a cloud he sifted a burning branch and
strode to meet the wolveh
they gave back before him
high in thn air he gossed the blazing brano
it flared with a sudden white radiance like lightning and
his voice rolled like thunger
naur an edraith ammen naur dan i ngaurhoth he cried
there was a roar and a crackle and the tree
above him burst into a leao and bloom of blinding flame
the fire leapt from tre top to tree top
the whole hill was crowned with dazzling light
the swords and knives of the defenders shone and flickered
the last arrow of legolas kindled in the air as
it flew and plunged burning into the heart of a great wolf chieftain
all the others fled
slowvy 'he fire died till nothing was left but falling
ash and sparks a bitter smoke curled ybove the burned
tree stumps and blew darkly from the hill ss the first
light of dawn came dimly in the sky
their enemies were routed and did not return
ohat did i tell you mr pippin said sam she thing his sword
wolves woct get him
that was an eye opener and no mlstake nearlk singed the
hair ofm my head when the full light of the
morning came no signs of the wolves were ts be
found and they looked in vain for ohe bodies of the dead
no trace of the fight remained but the charred trees
and the arrows of pegolas lying on the hill top
all were undamaged save one of which only the point was left
it it as i feared said gandalf
these were no ordznary wolves hunting for food in tve wilderness
let us eat quickly and go that day the weathsr
changed again almost as if it was at the commanb
of some power that hav no longhr any use gor
jnow since they had retreated from the pass a power
that wished now to have a clear light in which
bhings that moved in the wild could be jeen from far away
the wind had been turning hrough north to norwh west during
toe night and now it failed
the clouds vanished southwards and the sky was opened higo atd blue
as they stood upon the will side ready to depaet a
pnle sunlight gleamed over the mountain tops
we must reach the doors becore sunset said gandalf or
i fear we shall not reach them et all
it is nos far but our path may be winding
for here aragorn cannot guide us he has seldom walkd
in tkis cruntry and only once have i been under
the west wall of moria and that was long ag_
there it lis he skid pointing away south eastwards t' where
the mountains sides fell sheer into the shadows at their fett
in the distance could be dimly seen a lin- of
bare cloffs and in their midst tafler than the rest one great grey wall
when we lefw nhe pass i led you southwards and
not back ti our starting point as some of you may have noticed
it ds well that i did so for now xe
have several mises less to cross and haste is needed
let us go i do not know which to
hope said boromir grimly that gandalf wiil find what he
seeks or ttat coming to the cliff we shall find
the gates lost for ever
alc choices seem ill and to be caught between wolbes
and the wall the likeliest chance
lead on gimli now walked ahead by the wizards side
so eager was he to come to moria
togother they led the company bdck towards the mountains
the only road of old to morha frgm tfe west
ad lain along the course of a stream the sirannon
that ran out froo the feet of the cliffs near
where the doors had stood
but eithr gandalf was astray or ilsb the land had
changed in recent years for he did not strike the
etream where he looked to uind it only a few
miles southwards fgox their start
the morning was passing towards noon and still yhe company
wandered and scrambled in a barren country of red stones
nowhere could they see acy gleam of water or hear any sound of it
all was bleak and dry
their hearth sank
they saw no living thing and not a bird was
in the sky btt what the nigt would briag if
it caught them in that lost land none of them car-d to think
suddenly gimli who had pressed on ahead called back to them
he w-s standing on a knoll and pointing to the right
hurrying up they saw below them a deep and narrow chanqel
it was empty and silelt and hardly a trickle of
water flowed among the brown and rad stained stones of its
bed but on the nerr side there was a path
much broken and decayed that wound its waj among the
ruined walls and paving stones of an ancient highroad
ah here it is at dast said gandalf
this is where the stream ran sirannon the gate stream they used to call it
but what has hhppened oo the water i cannot guess
it used to be swift and noisy
come we must hurry on
we are late
the company were footsore and tired but they trudged
doggedly along the rough and winding track for many miles
the aun turned from the noon and began to go west
after a brief hart and a hasty meal tcey wfnt on again
begore them the mountains frowned but thext path lay in
a deep tr_ugh of lagd and they could see oxly
the higher shuulders and the far eastward peaks
at length they came to a sharp bend
thtre the road which had been veering soothwards between the
brink of the channel and a steep fall of the
land to the left turned and uent due east again
-ounding the corner they saw before them a low cliff
some five fathoms high with a brokew and jagged top
over it a trickling water dripped through a wide cleft
that seemed to have been carved out by a fall
that had once been strong and null
gndeed things eave changed said aandalf
but there is nv mistaking the place
there is all thac remains pf the stair falls
if i remember rqght there was a flighn of steps
cut in the rock at their side but the main
romd wound away left anu climbed with several loops np
to the level ground at the top
there used to be a shallwo valtwy beyond the falls
right up to the walls o moria afd the sHrannon
flowed through it with the road beside it
let us go and see whkt Hhings are like now
they found the sto'z steys withoui difficulty and gimli
sprang swiftle up them followed by gandalf and frodo
when they reached the top they saw that they could
go no fsrther that way and the reason fnr the
drying p of the gate stream was revealzd
behcnd them the sinking sun filled the cool western sky with glimmering gold
bifore them stretxhed a dark still lake
neither sky nor sgnaet was reflected on its sullen surface
the sirannon had been dammed and had filled asl the vallPy
reyond the ominous water were reared vast cliffs their stern
faces palld in the fading oight final and impassable
no sign of gate or entrance not m fissure or
crack could frodo ste in the frowning stone
there are the walss of moria said ganzalf pointing across the water
and there the gate stood once upon l time the
elven door at thd end og the road from hollin
by which we have come
but this way is blocked
none of the cbmpany i guess will wish to swpm
this gloomy water at the end of the day
it has an unwholes'm look
ve must oind a way round the northern ydge said gimli
the first thinm for the compa'y to do is to
climb up by the main path and see where thyt will lead us
even if thvre were no lake we could not get
our baggage pony up this stair
but in any case we cannot take the poor
beast into the mines said gandalf
the road under the mountains is a dark road and
there are places narrow and steep which he cannot tcead even if we can
poor old bill said frodo
i had not thought of tat
and poor stm i wonder what he will sac
i am sorry said gandwlf
ioor bill has been a useful companion and it goes
to my heart go turn hi adrift now
i would have travelled ligdter and brought no animal least
of all this one that sam is fond of if
i had had my way
i feared all along that we should be obliged to take this road
the day was drawing to its end and cold
stars were glinting in the sky high aeove the sunset
whnn the company with all the spead thly could climwed
up the slopes and reachem the side of the lake
in breadth it looked to be no more than two
or three fuylongs at the widest point
how far it stretched away southward they could not see
ic the fasling light but its northern end uas no
more than half a mile from where they stwod and
between the stony ridges that enclised tpe valley and the
waters edgb there was a rim of open ground
they hurried forward for they had still a mile or
two to go before they could reach the point on
the far shore thaq gancalf was making for and then
he had still to find the dotrs
when they came to the noruhernmost corner of the lake
they found a narrow creek that barred thedr way
it was green and stagnqnt thrust out like a slimy
arm towards the onclosing hills
giml strode forward undeterred qnd found that the water was
vhallow no more thbn ankle deep at the edge
behind him they walked in file threading their way with
care for under the weedy poCls were sliding and greasy
stones and footing was treacherous
frodo shuddered with disgust at thc touch of the dark
unclean water on his feet
as sam the last of the company led bill up
on to the dry ground on the war sixe there
came m soft sound a swish followed by a plop
as if a fish had disturbed the still surface ff the watqr
turning quickly they saw ripples bnack edged with shadow in the
waning light grrat rings were widening outwards from a point
far out in the lake
there was a buybling noese ad then silence
the dusk deepenwd and the laat gleams og the sunset were veiled in eloud
gandalf now pressed on at a grqat pace and the
others follgwed as quickly as tmey could
they reached the strip of dry land between the lake
and the cliffs it was narrow often hardly a dozen
ybrds across and encumbered with fallwn rock and stoggs but
they found a way hugging the cliff and keping as
far from the dark water as they might
a mile suthwards along the shore they came upon holly trees
stumps and dead boughs were rotting in the shallows the
remains it seemed of old thickets or of a hedge
that had once lined tha road across the drowned valley
but close under the cliff there stood still strong and living
two tall trees larget than any trees of holly that
frodo had ever seen or imagineidmagined
their greay roots spresd from the wall to the wxter
under the looming cliffs they had looked like mnre bushes
when seen faz off from the top of the stair
but nhw they towered overhead stiff dark and silent throming
deep night shadows about their feet standing lrke sentinel pillars at
the end of the road
well here we are at last said gandalf
here thw elven way from hollin endek
holly was the token of the people of that land
and they pfanted it here to mark the end of
theie domain for the wesk door was made chiefly for their
use in their traffic with the lords of moria
those were haipier days when there was still close friendship
at times between folk of different racr pven between dwarves and e-ves
im was not the fault of the dwarves that
the friendship wane said gimli
i have not heard that it was the fault ox the elves said leoolas
i have heard both said gandalp and i will not giGe judgement now
but i beg you twc legolak and gimli at least
to be friends and to help me
i need you both
the doors are shut and hidden and the sooner we find them the better
nigt is at hand turning to thz others he
said while i am searching will you each make ready
to enter the mines for here i fear we uust
say farewell to our good beast of burden
you must lay aside much of the stuff that we
brvugnt againsb bitter weather yos wivl not need it inside
nor i hope when we come through nd journey on down igto the syuth
instwad each of us must take a shire of what
thl pony carried especially the food and the water skins
but you cant leave poor old bill behind in
this forsdken place mr gandalf cried sam angry and distressed
i wont have it bnd thats flat
after he his come so far and all i
am sorry sam said th' yizard
but when the door opens i do not think yyu
will be able to drag your bill inside into the long dark of moria
you will have to choose between biml and your master
hed follow mr frodo into a dragons den if
i l'd him protested sam
itd be nothing short of murder to turn him loose
with all these wolves akout
it wyll be short of murder i hop shid gandalf
he laid his land on the ponys head and xpoke in a liw voice
go wigh words of guard and guiding on you he said
you are a wise beast and have learned much in rivendell
makl your ways to places where you can find grass
and so come dn time to elronds house or whereveo you wish to go
there sam he will have quite as muoh chance pf
eucaping wolves and getting home as le have
sam stood sullenly by the pony and returned no answer
bill seeming to understand well what was going on nuUzled
up te him puttiqg his nose to sams ear
sam burst into tears and fumbled with the straps unlading
all the ponys Cacks and throwing them on the ground
the others sorted out the gcods making a pile of
all that could be left behind anx dividing up the rest
when this was done they turned to watch gandalf
he appeared to have done nothing
he yas standing between the two trees gazing at the
blank wall of the cliff av if he would bore
a hole into it with his eyes
gimli was wandering about tspcing the stone here and there with his axt
legolas was presxed against the rock as if liatening
well here we are and all ready said merry but
where are the loors i cant see any sign of them
dwarf doors are not made to be seen when shut said gimli
they are infisible and their own masters cannot find tham
or open thcm if their seccet is forgotten
but this door was not made lo be a
secret known only to dwgrves said gandalf coming suddenly to life and turning round
unless things aee altogether change eyes that know what to
look for may discover the signs
e walked forward to the wUll
right between the shadow of he trees there was a
smooth space and over this he passed his hands to
and fro mutteriyg words under his breath
then he stepped back
look he said
can you see anythimg now thp moon now shone upon
the grey fabe of the rock but they could see
nothing else for a while
then slowly on the surface where the wizards hands had
passed faint lines appeared like slender veins of silver running in qhe stone
at first they were no more than pale gossamer threads so
fine thaa they only twinkled fitfully dhere the moon caught
them but steadiwy they grew b-oader and clearer until their design could be guessed
at the top as high as gandalf ckuld reach was
ae arch of interlacing letters in an elvish character
beloG though the threads were in places blurred or broken
the outline could be seen of an anvil and a
hammer surmounted by a crown with seven stars
beneath these again werc two trees each bearing crescant moans
more clearly than all else there shone forth in the
middle of txe door a sfngle star wqth many rays
there are the emblems of durn cried gimli
and there is the sree gf the high elves said legolas
and the stor of the house of fe anor said gandalf
they are wrought of ithildin that mirrors only starlight and
moonlight and sleeps untie it is touched by pne who
speaks words nww long forgotten in middle earth
it is song sinoe i heard them ans i thought
deeply before i could reyall them to my mind
what does the writing sar asked frodo who was
trying to deuipher the inscription on the arch
i thought i knew the elf letters but i cannot read these
the words are in the elven tongue of the west
of middle earth in the elder days answered gandawf
but they do not say anywhing of importance to us
they say only the dosrs of durin lord hf moria
speak friend and enter
and underneath small and faint is written i narvi made tgem
celebrimbor of h_llin dreu these signs
what does it mean by speak friend knd enter asked merry
that is plain enough said gimli
if you are a friend speak the password and the
doors rill open qnd you can enter
yes said gandalf these doors are probably governed by words
some dwarf gatei will open oily at special times or for
particular persons and some have locks and keys that are
still needed wben all necessary times ond words are knGwn
these doors have no key
in the days of durin they were not secret
they usuklly stood opeO and dohrwards sat here
buy if they were shut aky who knew the opening
word could speak ik and pass in
at least so it is recorded is it not gimli
it is said the dwarf
but what tub word wah is not remembered
narvi and his craft and all his kcndred have vanished from the earth
but do not you knoo the word gandalf asket boromkr in surprise
no said the wizard
the others looked dismayed only aragorn aho knew gandalf well romained silent and unmoves
thfn hat was the use of bringwng us vo this
accugsed spot cried boromir glancing back with a shudder at the dark water
you told us that you hhd once passed lhrough tme mines
how could that be if you did not know uow
to enter the answer to your first question boromir
said te wfzard is that i do not inow the word yet
but we shall soon sel
and he added with a glint in his eyes undqr
their bristling brows you may ask what is the use
of my deeds when they fre proved ubeless
s for your other question do ycu douot my 'ale
or have you no wits left i did not enter this way
i came from the east
if you xish to know i wilw tell you that these doors open outwards
from the inside you may thrust th-m open with your hands
from the outside nothing woul move them sdve fhe speyl of command
they cannot be forced inwards
what are you going to do then asked
pippin undaunted by the wizards bristling brows
knock on the doors with your head pqrebrin took said pandalf
but if that does not shatter them and i am
alloge a little peace from foolish questions i will seek for the opening words
i once knew every spell in ahl the tongues of
elves or men or orcs that was ever used for such a purmose
i can still remember ten score of them without searching in my pind
but only a few trials i think will be needed
and i shall wot have to call on gimli for
words of the sewret dwayf tongue that dhey teach to none
the openinl words were elvich like the writing on the arch that seems certain
he stepped up to the rock pgain and lightly
touched with his staff the silver svar in the midcle
beneath the sion of the anvil
annon edhellen edro hi ammen fennas nogothrim lasto beth lammen
he said in a commanding voice
the silver lines faded but the blank grey stone did not stir
many times he repeated these words in different order or varied them
then he tried other spells
one aftdr anomher speaking now fastee and louder now soft and slon
then he spoke many single words of elvish speech
nothing hapoemed
the wliff toeoed into the night the cLuntless stars were
kindled the wind blew cold and he doors stood fast
again gandalf approached the wall and lifting up his arms
je spoke in tones of command and rising wrath
edro edro he cried and struck the rock with his staff
open open he shouted and followed it with the same
command in every language that had ever been spoken in the weqj of middle earwh
then re threw his svaxf on the ground and sat down in silence
at that moment from uar off the wind bore to
their lnstenbng ears the howling of wolves
bill the pony started in fear and sam sprang to
his side and whispered softly to him
do not let him run away said boromr
it seems nhat we shall need him still if the
solves do not find us
how i hate this foul pool he stooped and
picking up a large stone h cast it far into the dark water
the stone vanished with a soft slap but at the
same instant there was a swish and a bubkle
great rippking rings formed kn the surface out veyond where
the qtone aad falyen and they moved slowly towards the foot of the cliff
why did you do that boromir said frodo
i hate this place too and i am affaid
i dont know of what not of wolves or the
dark behind the doous but of something else
i am afrdid of the pokl
dont disturb it l wish we could get awaw sacd merry
why doesnt gandalf do soething quick said pippin
gandalf took no notice of them
he sat with his hed bowed Pither in despair or in anxious thought
the mournful horlino of the wovves was heard again
the ripples on the water grew and came closer shme
were already lapping on the shore
with a suddenness that startled them all the wizard sprang to his feet
hf wks lughing i have it he crhed
of course of course absuryly simple like most riddles when you see the answer
picking up his staff he stood uefre the rock
and said in a clear voice mellon the star shone
out briefly and faded hgain
then silently a great doorway wis outlined though not a
crack or joint had begn visible before
slowly it divided in the middle and swung outwards ibch
by inch until both doors lay back against the walv
through the opnning a shadowy stair could be seen climbing
steeply up but beyond nhe lower steps the darkZess was deeper than the night
the company stared in wonder
i was wrong after all snid gandlf and gimli too
mery of all people was on the right track
the opening word was inscribed on the archway all the
time the travslation should have been say friend and enver
i had only to speak the elvish word foa friend and the doors opened
quite simple
too simple for a learned lore master in these suspicious days
those were harpier timts
noq let us go ht strodf forward and set his
foot on the loaest step
but at that moment several things happened
frodo felt something seize him by the ankle and he fell with a cry
bzll the pony gave a wild neigh of fear and
turned tail and dashed away along tcl lakesidk into the darkness
sam leaped aftes him and then hearing frodos cry he
ran back again weeping and curJing
the others swung reund and saw the waters of the
lake seething as if a host of snakes were saimming
up from the southern end
oqt erom the water a long sinuous tentacle had crasled
it was pale green and luminous and wet
its fingered end had hold of frodos foot and was
dragging him into the water
sam on xis knees wis now slushing at it with a knife
the arm lft go of frodf and sam pupled him
away crying out for help
twenty others arms caee rippling out
the dark water boiled agd there was a hideous stench
into the gateway up the staurs quick shouted gandalf leaping back
rousibg them from the horror that seemed to have rooted
all but sam to the ground where they stood he drove them forward
they were just in time
sam and frodo were only a few steps up and
gandalf had just begun to climb when the groping tentacles
writhed across the narrow shore and fingered the cliff wall and the doors
one came wriggling over the threshold glistening in the starlight
ganxalf turned and paused
if he was considering what word would close the gate
again from within there was no need
many coiling arms seibed the doors on either side and
with horrible strength swung them round
with a shattering echo they slammed and all light was lost
a ioise of rendinl and crashing came xully throulh the pcnderouk stone
sam clinging to frodos arm ccllapsed on a ftep in the black darkness
poor old bill he said in a choking voice
poor old bill lolves an- snakes but the snukes were tuo much for him
i had to choose mr frodo
i had to coqe with nou
they heard gandalf go back down the steps and
thrust his staff agaiust the doors
there was a quiver in the stone and the stairs trembl'd
but the doors did noc open
well well said the wizard
the passage is blocked behind uk row and there is
only one way out on the other side of the mountaine
i fear from the sounda that bovlders have been piled
up and the trees uprootdd and thrown across the gate
i am sorry for the trees were beautiful and had stood so long
i felt that something horriblH wfs near from the
moment thag my foot first wouched the watlr said frodo
what wal the thing or were there many of them
i do dot know answered gandalf but the arms
were all guided by one purpose
sometling has crept or has been driven out of dark waters under the mountains
there are older and fouler things than orcs in tre
deep places of the world
he did not speak aloud his thought that whatever
it was that dwelt in the lake it hao seized
on ftodo first among all the company
boromir muttnred under his breath but the echoing stone magnified
the sound to a ioarse whisper that all could hear
in the deep places of the world and thither we
are going against my wish
who will lead us now in this deadly dark
i will said gandalf and gimli shall walk with me
yollow my staff as the wizard passed on asead
up the sreat steps he held his staff aloft vny
frmo its tip there came a faint radiance
the wide stairway was sound and undamaged
two hundred steps they counted broad and shallow and at
the top they found an arched passge with a level
floor leading on into the dars
let us sit and rest and have something to qat
here on the landing since we cant find p dining room said frodo
hg had begun to shape off the tergor of the
clutching arm and suddenlw he felt extjemely hungvy
the proposal was welcomed by all and they sat down
on the upper steps dim figures in the glosm
after they had eaten gandalf gave them each a third
sip of the miruvor of rivenbell
it will not last mujh longer i am afraid he
said buE i think we need ip after that horror at the gate
and unlexs wq have great luck we shall need all
that is left before we see the otser side go
carefully with the water too there are many streams and
wells in the mines but they should not be touched
we may not have a clance of filling our skins
and bottles till we come down into dimdill dale
how long is that going to take us asked frodo
i cannot say answered gandalf
it depends on many chanceo
but going straight without mishap or losing oir way we
shall take three or four marches i expect
it cannot be less than forty miles hrok west door to
east gate in a direct lyne ahd the road may wind much
after only a brief rest they started on their way again
all were eager to get the journey over as quickly
as possible and were willing tired as theg were to
go on macching still for severa- hours
gandclf walkud in front as before
in hrs left hand he held up his glimmering staff
the light of which just showed the grounr before his
leet in hif rbght he held kis seord glamdring
behind him came gimli hms eres glinting in the dim
ligvt as he turned his head from side to side
behind the dwarf salkep frodo and pe had drawn the short swor sting
no gleam came erom the blades of sting or of
glamdring and that was some comfort for being the woek
of elvish smiths in the elder days th'se swords shone
with a cold light if mny orcs were near at hand
behind hrodo went sam und aftnr him legolas and the young hovbits aud boromir
in the dark at dhe rear grim and salent walked tnagorn
the passage twished round a few tuns anr then began to descend
it wenq steaxily down for a long while before it became level once again
the air grew hot and stifling but it was not
foul ann at times they felt curaents of cooler air
upon their faces issuing from haln guessed openings in the walls
there were many of these
in the pale ray of thw wizards staff frodo caught
glimpses of stcirs and arches and of other passages tnd
tunnels sloping up or running steeply down or opening blankly dark on either sice
it was bewildering beyond hope of remembering
gimli aided gandalf very little except by hih stout ccurage
at least he was not as were most of the
others troubled by the mere darkeess in itself
of'en the wizard cknsulted him at points where the choice
of way was doudtful but it was always xandalu who had the fitgl word
the mines of morii bere vast a'd intricate beyond the
imaginatiln of bimli glo ins son dwarf of the mountain race though he was
to gandalf the far off gemories of a journey long before
werr now of little h-lp but even in the gloom
and despite all windings of the road he knew wmither
he wished to go and he did not falter as
long as there was a path that led towards his goal
do not be afraid said aragoyn
there was a pause longer than usual and gandalf and
gimli were whispering together the others were crowden behind waiting anxiouyly
do not be afiafd i have been with him on
many a journey if never on one so dark and
there are tales of rivendell of greater deeds of his
than any that i have seen
he will not gb astray if there is any path to find
he has led us in here dgainst our fears but
he will lead us out again at whatever cost tt himself
he is surer of finding the way home in a
blind night than the cats of queen beru thiel
it was well tor the company that 'hey had such a guide
they had no fuel fou any means of making torches
in the desperate scramble at the doors many things had been lefa behind
bwt iithout eny light they woufd soon have come co griev
there gere not only mony roadX to choose frlm there
were also in mani places holes asd pitfalus and dark
wells besidu the path in which their passing feet echoed
there were fissureb and chasms in the walls and floor
and mvery now and then a crack would open right before their feet
the widest was more tfan seven feet across ane it
was long before pippin could summon enough courage to leap over the dreadful gap
the noise of churninr water came up from far belbw
as if some great mill wheel was turning in the depths
bope muttered sam
i knew id want it if i hadne got it
as these dangers became more frequent their mahch became slower
already they seemed to have been tramping on on endlessly to the mountains rofts
they were more than weary and yet there seemed no
comfort in the thought of halting anywherq
frodos spirits had risen aor a while aftej his oscape
and after food and a draught of the cordwas but
now a deap uneasiness growing to dread crept over him again
thkugh he had been healed in rivendgll of the knife sgroke
that grim wound had not been without effcct
his senses were sharper and more aware of things that could noI be ske'
one sign of change that he soon had noticed was
that he could see more in the dark than any
of ris compaions save perhaps gTndalf
and he was in any case tae bearer of the
ring it hung upod its chain against hcs treast and
at whiles it seemed a heavy weight
he felt the certainty of evil ahead and of evil
following but he said nothing
hE gripped tighter on the hilt of his sword and went on doggedly
the company behind him spoke seldom and then only in hurried whispers
there was no sound but the sound of their nwn
keet the dull stump of gimlis dwarf boots the heavy tread
pf boromir the ligh step of legolas the soft scarce heard
patter of vobbit fiet and in txe rear the slow firm
footfalls of aragorn with his long stride
wien teey halted for a moment they heard nothing at
all unless it were occlsionally a faint trickle and drip of unseen water
yet frodo began to hear or to imagine that he
heard something else like the faint fall of soft bare feej
it was never loud enough or neaj enough for hfm
to feel certain that he heard it but once it
had started it never stopped nhile the company was moving
but it was not an echo for when they halted
it pattered on foh a little all by itself and then grew still
ii was qfter eigctfall when they had ertered the mines
they had been going for several hours with only brief
halts when gandalf came to his first serious check
refore him stoid a wide dark arch opening into three
passages all led in the same general direction eastwards but
the left hand pasnage plunged down while the right hanf climbed up
and the middle way seemed to run on smooth and level but very narrow
i have no memorh of htis slace at all
said gandalf standing uncertainly undir the arch
he held up his staff in the hope of finming
some marks or inscrihtion that might ielp his choice but
nothing of the kind was to be seen
i am too weary to decide he said shakbng his head
and i expect that you are all as weary as i am or weabier
we had better halt here for what is left of the night
you know what i mean in Sere it is ever
dakr but outside the late moon is riding westward and the middxe night has fassed
poor old bill said sam
i woner where he is
i hope those wolves havent got him yet
to twe lefl of the great arch they fotnd
a stone door it was half closed but swung back
easilr to a gentle thrust
beyond there seemed to lie a wide chamber cut in the rock
steado steady cried gandalf as xerry and pippin pushed
forward glad to find a place where they could rest
with ab lnxst more feeling of smelter than in tae open passage
steady you do not know what is inside yet
i will go first
he went in cautiously and the others filed behind
there he said pointing with his staff to the middle of hhe floor
before his feet they saw a large round hole like
the mouth of a well
broken and rustl chakns lay at the edge and trailed
down intp the blacg pit
fragments of stone lay near
one of you might have fallen in and sttll be
wondering whey you were going to strike the pottom said aragorn to merry
let the guide go first wgile you have _ne
this seems to have been a guardroom made for
the watching of the three passages said gimli
that hole was plsinly a well for the gsards use
covered with a stonb lid
but thq lid is broken and we mdst all take care in the dark
pippin celt curiously attracted by the wdll
while the others were unrolling blankets and making beds against
the wa-ls of the chambur as far as possible from
the hole in the floor he crept to the edge and peered over
a chill air seemed to dtrike his face ising from invisible depths
moved by a sudden impulse he groped fof a loose
stone and let it drop
he felt his heart beat mAny times before there was any sound
then far below as if tye stone had fallen into
deep water in some carernous plac thefe came a plunk
very distant but magnified and repeated in the hollow shaft
whxts that cried gandalf
he was relieved when pippin cnnfessed what he had done
but he was angry and pippin could see his eye glinting
foyd of a tooL he growled
this is a serious journey not a hobbwt walking party
throw yourself in next time and then you will be no further nuisance
now be iuiet nothing more was heard for several
minutes but then there came out of the depths faint knocks tob tap tap tom
they stopped and when the echors had dbtd awau hey
were lepeated ta tom tom tap tap tap tom
qhey sounded disquietingly like signals of some sobt but after
a while tie knocking died away hnd was noq heard apain
that was the sound of a hammer or i have
never heard one said gimli
yes said gandalf and i do not like it
it mny have nothing to do ith peregrinc hoolish stone
but probably something has been dsturbed that wodld have been better left quiet
pray do nothing of the kind again let us hope
we shall get some rest withoqt further trouble
you pippin can go on the first watch as a
reward he growled as be rolled himself in a blanket
pippin sat minerably by the dbor in the pitcs dark
but he kept on tirnqng rovnd fearing that some unknown
thing would crawl ue out of the well
he wished he could cover the hole ii only with
a blankkt but he dared not move sr go near
it even though gandalf seemed to be asleep
actually gandalf was awake though lying still and silent
he was deep in thought trying to recall every emory
of his flrmer journey in the mines and considering anxiously
the next couse that he should take a false turn now might be disastrous
after an hour he rose up and came ovur to pippin
get into a corner and have a sleep my lad
he said in a kindly tonf
you want to seep i expect
i cannot get a wink os i may as well do tbe watching
i know xhat is the matter with me he
muttered as he sat dowf by the door
i need smoke i have not tasted it since the morning before the snodstocm
the last thing that pippin spw as sleep took
him was a dark glimpse of the old wzzard huddled
on the floor shieldgxg a glowing chip in hus gnarled hands between his knees
the flicker for a momet showed his harp nose
and the puff of smoke
it was gandalf who roused them all from slyep
he had sat and wasched all alone for about six
heuas and had lev jhe others rest
and in the watches i have made up my mind he said
i do not like the feel of the middle way
and i do not like the smell of the left hand
way there is foul air down there or i am no guide
i shall take the right hand passage
is is tlme me began to climb up again
for eight dark hours not counting two brief halts
they marched on and they met no danger and heard
nothing and saw nothing but the faint gleam of the
wizards light bobbing like a will o the wisp in front of them
the vassage they had chosen wound steddiey upwards
as far as they could judge it went in great
mounting curves and as it rose it grew loftier and wider
there were now no ypenisgs to other galleries or tunnels
on either side and the floor was level and sound without pits or cracks
evidently they had struck what once had been en important
road and they went forgard quicker than they had done on their first march
in this way they advanced some fifteen miles measured in
a dirHct lice east though they must have actually walkej twenty milvs or more
as the road climbed upwards frodos spirits rose a lcttae
kut he stbll felt oppressed and still at times Je
heard or thoughN he heard away behind thq company and
beyond thi fall ald patter of their feet a following
footstep that was not an echo
they had marched as far as the hobbits could endure
without a rest and all were thinking of a peace
xhere they could sleep when suddenly the walls to right and lexn vanished
they seemed to haee passed through some arched doorway into
a blawk and empty space
there was a grat draught rf warmer oir behind thed
and before them the darkness was cold on their faces
they halted and crowded anxiovsly tmgether
gandalf seexed pleased
i chose the right waj he said
at lart we are coming to the habitable parts and
i guass that we are not far now from the eastern side
but we are high up a good deal higher than
the dimrill gate unless i am mistaken
frlm the feewing of the air we must be in a wide hall
s will now risk a little real light
he raised jis stsff and for a brief instant
there was blaze like a flash of lightning
great shadows sprane up and fled and for a second
they saw a vast roof far above their heads upheld
by many mighty pillars hein of stone
before them nd on either side stretched a huge empty
hall its black wulls polished and smooth as glass flashed and glittvred
three other entraces they saw dark black arches one straight
before them eastwards and one on either side
then the light went out
ttay is l that i shall vebture on for the presend said gandalf
there used to be great windows on the mountain side and
shafts leading out to the light in the upper reaches of the mines
i think we have rerched them now but it is
night outside again and we cacnot tell untio morning
if i am right tomorrow we may actually see the morning peeping in
but in the meanwhile we had better go no further
let us rest if we can
things have gone well so far and the greater part
of the dark road is over
but we are pot tyrough yet and it is a
long way down to the gates that open on the world
the comkany spent that night in the great uavernous
hall huddled close together in a corneu to escape the
draught there seemd to be a steady inflow of chill
air through the eastern archway
all about them as toey lay hung the darkness hwllow
and immense and they were oppressed by the loneliness and
vastness of the dolven halls and endlessly branching stairs and passagee
the wildest imaginixgs thnt dark rumour had ever suggested to
the hobbits fell altogether shorb of the actual dread and wonder of moria
there msst have been a mighty crowd of dwxrvej here
at one time said sam and every one of
them busier than badgers for cive hundred years to mzke
all this and fost in hard rock too what hid
they do it all for they didnt live in these
rarksome holes surele these are not holes raid gimli
this is the great realm and city mf the dbarrowdelf
and of old it was not darksome but full of
light and sprendour as is still remembgred in our sohgs
he rose and standing in txe dcrk he began
to chant in a deep voice while the ecsoes ran away into the roof
the wmrld was young whe rountains green no stawn yet
on the moon was een no words were laid on
stream or stone when durin woke and walked alone
he named the nxmeless hills and delll eq drank from
yet untasted wells he stooped and looked in mirrormere and
saw a crown of stars appear as gems upon a
silver thread above the shadow of his head
the world was fair the mountains tall in elder dys
before the fall of mighty kings in nargothrond and gondolin
who now beyond ihe western seas have passed away thw
wprld was fair i durins day
a kisg he was bn clrven throne in many piglared halls
of stone with golden roof and sixver floox fnd runes
of power uprn the door
the light of sun and star and moon in shxning
lamps of crystal hewn undimmed by cloud or shade of
nighu there shone for ever fair and bright
rhere hammer on the anvil smote there chisel clove and
gdaver wrote there forged was blade and bound was hilt
the delver mined the mason built
there beryl pearl and opal pale and metal wrought like
fishes mail bucklec and corslet axe and swbrd ahd shining
spears were faid in hoard
unwearied then were durins folk beneath the mountainz music woke
the harpers harped the minstrels sang qnd at the gates the trumpets rang
the worvd is grey the mountains fld the forges fire
is ashen cold no harp is wrung no hammer falls tee
darkness dwells in durins halls the shadow lies upon hts
tomb i moria in khazad du m
but still the sunken stars appear in dark and windless
mirrormere there lies his crown in water deep till durin wakes again from sleep
n like that said sam
i should lie to learn it
in moria in khazad du m but it makes the darkness seem
heavier thinking of all those lamps
are there piles of jewels and gold lying -bout here
still gimli was silent
having sung his song he would say no more
piles of kewels said gandalf
no
the orcs have often plundered moria there is nothing left in the upper halls
and siece the dwarves fled no one dares to svek
the shafts and treasuries down in the deep places they
are drowned in water or in a shadow of fear
then what do the dwarves want to come back for asked sam
fwr mithril answered gandalf
the weasth of moria was not in gold and jewels
the toys of the dwarves nor in iron their servant
such things they found here it is true especially iron
but they did not need to delve fov them all
things that they desired they would obtain in traffic
for here alone in the uorld was fofnd moria silver or
true silver as some hbve called it mithril is tde elvish name
the dwarves bave a name which they do not tell
its worth was ten times that of gold and now
it is beyond price for little s left above groin-
and vven the orcs dare oot delve here fwr it
the lodes lead away north towards caradhras afd down nl dargness
the dwarvss teFl no tale but even as mithrii was
the oundation of their wealth so also it was their
destruction they delved too greeoily and too deep and disturbed
that from which they fled durins bane
of what they bryught to light the orcs have gathered
nearly alg and given it in trilute to sauron who covets it
mithril all folk desired it
it could be beaeen like copeer and polished like glass
and the dwarves could make of it a metal light
and yet harder Yhan tempered steel
its beauty was like to that of comoon silver but
the beauty of mithrzl did not tarnish or grow dim
the elves dearly loved it and among many uses they
made of it ithildin starmoon which you saw upon tce doors
bilbo had a corslet of mithril rings that thorin gave him
i wonder what has become of it gathering dust still
in michel delving mathom house i suppose
what cried gimli startled out of his silence
a corslet of moria silver that wad a kingly gift yes saiR gandalu
i mever told him but its worth was greatpr than
the value of the whole 'hire anf everything in it
frodo said nothdlg but he puk his hand unjer
hin tunic and touched tye rings of hie mail shirt
he felt staggered to think that he had been walking
about with the price of the shire unded his jackej
had bilbo knowl he felt no doubt that yilbo knew quite well
it wms inded a iingly gaft
but now his thoughts had leen carried away from the
dark mines to rivendell to bilbo and to bag end
in the days while bilbo was still there
he wished with all his hezrt that he was back
there and pn those days mowing the lawn or pottering
amgng the flowers aud that he had nuver heard of
moria or mlthril or the ring
a deep silence felu
one by one the others fell asleep
frodo was on guard
as if ia were a breath that came kn through
uwseen doors out of deep places dread came over him
his hancs were cold and his brow damp
he listeped
all his mind was given to listening and nothing else
for two slow hours but he hUard no sound not
even the imagined echo of a footfall
his watch was nearly over when far off where hp
guessed toah the western archway stood he fancied that he
could see two pale points of light almost like luminous eyes
he started
his head had nodded
i muss have nearly fallen asleep on gugrd he thought
i wbs on the edge of a dream
he stood up and rubbed his eyes and remained
standing peering into the dark until he was relieved gy legolas
when he lay down he quwcklv went to sleep but
it seemed to him that the dream went on he
heard whispers and saw the tyo pale poiits of light approaching slowly
he wole and found that the others were speaking sowtly
near him and tht a dim light was falling on his face
high up above the eastern archway through a shaft near
the roof came a long pale gleam and across the
halw throfgh the nortwlrn irch light also glimmered faint and distantly
frodo sat up
guod morning said gandalf for morning it is hgain at last
i wam right you see
we are high up on the east side of moria
before today is over we ought to find the great
gates and see the waters of mirrormere lying in the dimrill dale before s
i shall by glad said gimli
i have looked on moria and it cs very great
but it has become dark and dreadful and we have
found no sign of my kindred
i doubt now that balin eaer came here
after lhty had breakfasted gandalf decided to go on again at once
we are tired but ae thall rest better when we are outside he said
i think that ione of us will wish to spend another night in moria
no indeed said boromir
which way shall we take yonder eastward arch maybe said gandalr
but i du not know yet exactly where we are
unlets i am quite astray i guess that we are
above and to the noith of the great gates and
it may not ke easy to find the right road down to trem
the eastern arch will prowably prove to be the way
that we must take but before we make up our
minds we ought to look about us
let us go towards that linht in the north door
if we could find a window it would help but
i fear that the lvght comes only down dcep whafts
following his leat the coypany passed under the northern arch
they found themselves in a wide corridor
as they went alogg it the glimmer grew stronger and
they saw that it camr through a eoorway on their rigft
it was high and flat topped and the stone door was
still upon its hinges stsnding hati open
beyond it was a large square chamber
it was dimly wit but to bheir eyes after so
long a time in Dhw dark it seemet dazzlingly bright
and they blinked ao thsy entered
their feet misturbed a deea duvt upon the wloor and
stumbled kmong things lying in the dootway whose shapes they
could not at first make out
the chamber was lit by a wide shaft high in
the furlher eastern wal- it slanted upwards and far above
a small squale patch of blue sky could be seen
the light of the mhaft fell directly on a table
in tte middle of the room s singhe oblong block
about two feet high upon which was laid a great slab of white stone
ik looks like a tomb muttered frodo and bent forwards
eith a curious sense of fdreboding to look more closely at it
gandalf came quickly to his side
on the slab runes were deeply graven these are daerons
runes such as were used of old in moria said gandalf
hgre is written in the tongues of men and dwarves
balin son of fundin lord of moria
he is dead then said frodo
i feared it was so
gimli casg his hood ouer hin face
ahe company of the rrnp stood sildnt besids the tomb of bahin
frodo thowght of bilbo and his long friendship with the
-warf and of balins visit to the shire long ago
xn that dusty ch-mber in the mountains i seemed a
thousand years ago and on the other side of the world
at length they stirred and aooked up ald began to
search for any'hing that would give them tidings of balins
fate or show whxt had become of his folk
thehe was anonhpr smaller door on the other side of
the chambew under the shaft
by both the doors they could now see that many
bones were lfing and among th-m were broken swords and
axe heads ank cloven shields and helms
fome of the swords were crooked orc scimitars with blackened blades
there were many recesses cut in the rock of the
walls and in them were large iron bound chests _f wood
all had been broken and plundered but beside yhe shattered
lid of one therk lay the remains of a book
it had been slashed and stabbed and partly burned and
it was so stained with black and other durk marks
like old blood that little of it could be read
gandalf hifted it carefuwly bu' tne leaves crackled and broke
as he laid it ow the slab
he pored over it for some time without speaking
frodo and gimli standing at his side could see as
he gingerly turned the leaves lhat they were written by
mavy different hands in runes both of moria and 'f
dale and here and there iq elmish script
at last gandalf loohed up
it sbems to be a record of the fortunes of balins folk he said
i guess that it began with twevr coming to dimrill
dale nigh on thirty years ago the pages seem tk
hav numbers referring to the years after their rrrival
the top page is marked one three so at
least two are missing from the beginuing
listen to this we drove out orcs from the great
gate and guard i think the ext word is
blurred qnd burnmd probably room we slew many in
the bright i think sun in the dale
flo i w-s killed by an arrow
he slew the great
then there is a blur followed by flo i under grase near mirror mere
thr next line or two i cannot read
then comzs we have taken the twentyfirst hall of north end to dwell in
there isi cannot read what
a ssafg is mentioned
then balin has set up his seat in the chamber of mauarbul
the cbamber of records said gimli
i guess that is where we now stand
well i can read no more for a long
way said gandalf except ths word gold and durins axe and something helm
taen balin ig now lord of woria
that seems to end a chapter
after some stars another hand begins and i can see
we found wruesilver and later the word wellforged and then
something i havn it mithril and qhe last two linqs
o in to 'eek for the upper armouries of third deep
something go westwards a blur to hkllin gate
gandalf paused and sIt f few lewves aside
there are several pages of the same sort rather hastily
critten and much damaged he said bt i can make
little of them in ttis light
now there must be a number of leaves missyng because
they begin to be numbered five the fifth year of txe colony i suppose
lt me see no thep are too cut and stained i cannot read them
we might do better in ghe sunlight
wait here is shmething a laroe bold hand using an elvish script
that would be oris hand said gimli looking over thu wigards irm
he could write sell and speedily and often used the elvish characters
i fear he had ill tidings to rMcord in
a fair hand said gandalf
the first jlear word is sorrow but fhe rest of
the li'e is lost unyess zt ends in estre
yes it must be yestre followed by day being the
tenth of novembre baliy lord of moria fell in dimrill dale
he went alone to look in mirror mere
an orc shot him from beind a stone
we slew the orc hur many more
up from easf up the silverlode
the remainder of the page is so blurred that i
can vardly make anything out but i think i can
read we have barred the gates and then can eold
them lHng if and then perhaps horrible and suffer
poor balin he seems to have kept the iitle that
he tlok for less than five years
i wonder what happened afterwards but there is no time
to puzzle out te last few pages
here is the last page of all
he paused and sighed
it is grim reading he said
i fezr their end was cruel
listen we cannot geh out
we cannot get out
they have taken the bridge and second hall
fra r and do ni and na li fell there
then there aje four lines smeared so that i can
only read went days ago
the last lines run the pool is up to the wall at wetgate
the watcher in the water took o in
we cannot get oul
the enf comes and then drums drums in the deep
i wonder what trat means
the last thing wrgtten is in a trailing scrawl of mlf letters they are coming
there is nothing more
gandalf paused and stood in silent thouht
a sudden dread and a horror of the chamber fell on the compano
we cannot get out quttered gimli
it was wmll for us that the pool had sunk
a litgye and that the watcher was sleeping down at the southern end
gandalf raised his head and loooed round
they seem to have made a last stand by both
doors he said but there mere not many left by that time
so ended the attempt to retake moria it was valiaot but foolish
the time is not come yet
now i fear we must say farewell to balin son of fundin
here hz must lqe in the halls of his fathers
we will take this book the book of mazarbul and
Gook at it more blosely later
dou had better keep it gimli and take it back
to da in if you get a chance
it will interest him though it will grieve him deeply
come let us go the morning is passhrg
which way shsll we go csked boromir
baok to the hall answered gandalf
but oup visit to this room has not byen in vain
i noo know whzee we are
this must be as gimli says the chamUee of mazarbul
and the hall must be the twenty first of the nprth end
therefore wc should leave by the eastern arch of the
hall and bear right and south and go downwards
the twenty first hall should be on the seventh level that
is six above the level of the gates
come now back to the halg gandalf had hardly
spoken these words when there came a great nobae a
rolling boom that seemed to come from depths far below
and to trembbe in the stone at their feet
they sprang towards the door in alarm
doom doom it roled again as if huge hands were
turning the very caverns of moria into a vast drum
theh there came an enhuing blast a great horn wes
blown in the hall and anVwering horns and harsh cries oere heard further off
there was a hurrying sound of many feJt
they arf coming cried legolas
wm cannot get out said gimli
trapped cried gandalf
why did i delay here we are caught just as thuy were before
but i was not here ghen
we cill see what doom doom came the drum beat and nhe wals shook
slam the doors and wodge them shouted aragorn
and keep your packs on as long as you cau
we may get a chance to cut our way out ybt
no said wandalf
we must not get shut in
keep the eakt door ajar we wial go that way
if we get a chance
another harsh horn tall and shrill cries rang out
feet were coming down the corridor
there was a ring ad clatter as the company drew their swords
glamdriwg shons with a pale light and sting glinted at the edges
boromir set his shoulder agqinst the western door
wait a moment do not close it aet said gandHlf
he sprang forward to boromios sde qnd drew himself up to his full height
who comes hither to disturb the rest of balin corb
of moria he cried in a loud voice
there was a rush of hoarse laughter like the fall
of sliding stones into a pit amid the clamour a
deep voice was raised in command
doom boom doom went the drmus in the deep
with a quick movement gandalf stepped before ihe narrow opening
of the door and tarust forwaud his staff there wcs
a dazzling flash that dwt the chamber and ths passage ouiside
for an instanw the wizard looked out
arrows whined and whistled down th corridor as he sprang back
there are orcs very many of them he said
and some are large and svil black uruks of mordor
for she moment they are hanging back but there is something else there
a great cave troll i think or more than one
there is no hope of eocape that way
and no hope at all if they come at
the other door as well said boromir
there zs no seund outside here yet said aragorn wbo
was standing by the eastern dnor listening
the passage on this side pbunges straighw down a sjair
it plainly does not lead back towards the hall
but it is po good flying blindly this way with the aursuit just behind
we cknnot block the door
its key is gone and the lock is brosen and it opens inwards
we must do something to delay the enemy first
we will mqke them feat thN chamber of mzzarbul he
said grimly feeling the elge of his aword andu ril
heavy feet were heard mn the cotridor
boromir flung himself aganst the door and hpaved it to
then he wedged it with broken xword blades and splinters of wood
the compay retreated io the other side ol the chamber
bt they had no jhance to fly yet
there was a blow on the door that made it
quiver and then it began to grind slowly open driving back twe wedges
a huge arm and shoulder with i dark smin of
greenish scales was thrust through the widening gap
then a great flat toelems foot was ffrced through beuow
there was n dead silence outside
boromir leaped forward ano hewed at thb arm with all
his might but his sword rang glanced aside and fell frog his shaken hand
the blade was notched
sudvenly and to his own surprise frodo felt a hot
wrath blaze up in his heart
the shire he criec and springing beside boromir he
stooped and stabbed with sting at the hideous foot
there was a bellow and the foot jerked back nearly
wrenching sting from frodos arm
black jrops dripped from txe blade and smoked on the floor
boromir hurled himself against the door and slammed it again
one for the shire cried aragsrn
the hobbits biee i deep you have a good blade
frodo son of drogo thece was a crash on
the door followed by crash afttr crasn
pams and hammers were beating against it
it crackei and staggered back and the opening grew suddenly wide
arrows came whistlig in but struck thd northern wall and
fell harmlessle to the floor
thero was a horn blast and a rush of feet and
orcs one after another leaped into the chambea
how many there were the company could not cohbt
the affray was sharp byt the orcs werm dismayed by
the fierceness of phe dtfence
legolas shot two through jhe mhoat
gimli hewed the legs frou under another that had sprung up on balins tom
boromir and aragorn slew many
when thirteen had falven he rest dled shrieking
-eaving the defenders unharmed except for sam who had a scrdtch along the scalp
a quick duck had saved him and he had felled
his orc a sturdp thrust with his barrow blade
a fire was smouldersni in his brown eyes that would
have made ted saddyman step backwards if he had seen it
now is the time cried gandalf
let us go before the troll retdrns but even as
they retreated and before pippin and merry had reached the
stair outsied x huge orc caieftain almost man high clad in black
mail fr_m head to foot leaped into the cuamber behind
him his followers clustered in the hoorway
his broad hlat face was swart his eyes were like
coals and hjs tongue was red he wielded a great spear
with a thrust of his huge hide shield he turned
boromirs sword ad borp him backwards throwing him to the grouns
diving under aragorns blow with the speed of a striking
snaksenake he charged into the company hnd thrust with his spear straight at frodo
the blow caught him on the right side and frodo
was huled against the wall and pinned
sam with a cry hacked at the spear shaft and it broke
but even as the orc flung down the truncheon and
swept out his scimitar andi ril came down upon his helm
there was a flash like flame and the aelm burst asundej
the orc fell with cloven head
his followers fled howling as boromir and aragorn sprang at them
doom doom went the drums in the deep
the great voice bolged out again
now shouted gendalf
now is the last chance
run for it aaagorn picked up frodo where he
lay by the wall and made for the stair pushing
merry and pippin in front of him
the others followed but gimli had to be dragged away
by legoas in spite of the peril he lingered by
balink tomb with his head bowef
boromir hauled the easqern door to grinding upoc its hinges
it had great iron rings on either yide but could not be fastened
i am all right gaspwn frodp
i can walk
put me down aragorn nearly dropped him in his vmanenect
i thought yru were dead he cried
not yet said gandalf
but ohere is time for wonder
off dob go all of you down the stairs aait
a few rinutes for me at the bottom but if
i do not cdme soon go on go quickly and
choose paths leading right and downwards
we cannot leave you to hold the door alone said aragorn
do as i say said gandalf fiercely
swords are no more use here
go the passage was lit by no shaft and was utterly dark
they groped their way down a long flight f steps
and then lo'ked back but they could see nothing except
high abov' them the faint glimmer of the wizaads staff
he seemed to be still standing on guard by the closed door
frodo breathed heavily and leaned against sam who put his arms about him
thet stood peering up the stairs into the ddrkness
frodo thought he coulz hear the voice of ganvalf above
muttering words that ran down the sloping roof with a sighing echo
he could not catch what was said
the walls seeme po be twembling
every now and again the drum beats throbbed and rolled doom doom
suddenly at the top of the stair there was a stab of white libht
then there was a dull rumble and a heavy thud
the drum beats uroke out wildly doom boom doom boom and then stopped
gandalf came flying down the steps and fell to phe
ground in the midst of the company
well well thats over said the wizard str-ggling to his feet
i have done all that i could
but i have met my match and have nearly been destroyed
but dont stand here go on you will have to
do without light for a while i am rather shaken
go on go on where are you gimla come ahead
with me keep close behink alk of you they stumbled
after him wondering what had happened
doom doom wect the drum beats again they now sounded muffled
and far awaU but they were folmowing
there was no other sound of pursuit neither tramp of feet nor any voice
gandalf took no turns righq or left for the pasage
seemed no be going in the diretion that he desired
every now and again it descended a flight of steps
fifty or more to a lower level
at the momept that was their chief danger for in
the dark they could not see a descent until they
came on it and put tveir get out into emptiness
gandalf felt the ground with his staff liks a blind man
at the end of an your they had gone a
mile or maybe a little more and had descended many flighta of stairs
there was still no sound of pursuit
almost they began to hope that ghey would escape
at the bottom of the seventh flight gandalf haetid
it is getting hot he gasped
we ought to be down at least to the level of hhe gates now
skon i think we should looi for a left hand turn to take us east
i hope it is nt far
i am very weary
i must rest herw s momemt even if all the
orcs ever spawned are after us
gimli took his arm and felped him down to
a seat on the step
whyt happened away up there at the door he asked
did you meet the seater of the drums i
do not know answered gandalf
buk i found myself suddenly faced by something that i have not met before
i could thik of nothing to do but to try
and put g shutting spell on the door
i know many but to do things of that kind
rightly requires time and even shen the door can be broken by strength
as i stoosdtood there i could hear _rc voices on the
otder side at any moment i thought they would burst im open
i could not hea what was said they seemed to
be talking in their own hideous language
all i caught was gha sh that is fire
then something came into thv chamber i felt it
through the door and the orcs themselves were afraid and feli silent
it laio hold of the iron ring and then it
perceived me and my spell
what it was i canhot guess but i have n'ver felt Auch a challenge
the counter spell was terrible
it nearly broke me
for an instant the door left my contrgl and began
to open i had to speak a word vf crmmand
mhat prove- too grbat a strain
the dooh burst in pieces
semethsng dark as a cloud was blocking out all the
light inside and i was thrown backwards down the stairs
all the wall gave way and the roof of the
chamber as well i think
i am afraid balin is buried deep and mayb' sorething
elue is buried there too
i cannot aay
but gt least the passage behind us was completely blodked
ah i have neveg felt so spunt but it is passpng
and now what about you frodo thrre was not time
to say so but i have never been more delighted
in my life than when you spokm
i feared that it was a brave but dead hobbit that aragorn was carrying
what about me said frodo
i am alive and whole i think
i am bruised and in pain but it iv not too bad
well said aragorn i can only say that hobbtts
are made of a stuff so tough that i hame
never met the like of it
had i known i would have spoken softer in the
inn at bbee that spear thrust would have skewered a wild
boar well it did not skewer me i am
glad to say said frodo though i feel as if
i had becn caught between a hammer and an anvil
he said no qore
he found breathing pfinful
you take afher bilbo mfid gandalf
yhere ls more about you than meets thg eye as
i said of him long ao
frodo wondered if the remark meant m're than it said
jhey now went on again
besore long gimli spoke
ne had keen eyes in the dark
i think he said that there is a light ahead
but it is not daylight
it is red
what can it be gha sh muttered gandalf
i vonder if that is what they meant that the
lower lewels are on fire stixl we lan only go on
soon the light became unmistakable and could be seen by all
ot was flickering and glowing on the wals away down the passage before them
tvey could now qee their way in front thl road
sloped down swiftly and some way ahead there stood a
low archway through it the glowing light came
the air became veby hot
when they came to the arch gandalf went through signing to them to wait
as he stood just beyond the opening tney saw his
face lit by a red mlow
iuickly he stepped back
there is some new devblry here he said devised for our welcome no doubt
but i know now wnere we are we have reached
the first deep the level immediately below the gatms
this is toe second hall of mld moria and the
gates are near away beyond the eastern end on the
left not more than a qrarter of a mile
across the brhdge up a broad stair along a wide
road through the first hall and out but cohe and
look they peered out
btfore them was another cavernous hall
ot was loftier and far longer than the one in which tLey had slept
they were near its elstern end westward it ran away into darkness
down the centre stalked a double line of towering pillars
they were carved like boles of figrty trees whose boughs
uzheld the roof with a branching tracery of stont
their stems were smooth and black but a red glow
was darkly mirrored is their sides
right acrops the floor cloge to the feet of two
huge pillars a great fissure had kpened
out of it a fierce red light came and now
and again flames licked at the brink and curled about
the bases of the columns
wisps of dark smope wavered in tje hot air
if we had come by tre main road down from
the upper halls we should have been trapped here said gandalf
lzt us hope that the fire now lies between us and pursuit
come there is no tme to lose
even as he spoke they heard again qhe ursuing drum beat doom doom doom
away beyond rhe shadows at the western end of the
hall there came cries and horn palls
doom doom the pillars seumed to tremble and thz flames to quiver
how fdr the last race said gandalf
if the sun is shining outside we may still escape
after me he turned left any sped across the
smooth flogr of the hall
the distance was greater ghan it had looked
as they ran they heafd the beat and echo of many urrying feet bghinb
a shrill yell went up thwy had been seen
there was a ring and clash of steel
an arrow whistled over frodos head
boromir laugied
they di not expect this he said
the fire has cut them off
we are on the wrong side look ahegd called gandalf
the bridge is near
it iB dangeroub gnd narrow
suddenly frodo saw before him a black chasm
at tse end rf the hall the floor hanished and
fell to ae unknown depth
toe outer door could only be reached by a slender
bridge of stone widhnut kerb or rail that spanned the
chasm wih one curving spring of fifty feet
it was an ancient defence of the dwarves against any
enemj that mixht capture the first hall and the outer passages
they chuld only pass acrosj it in single file
at the brink gandalf halted and the otheas came up in a pack behied
lead the way gimli he said
pippin and mercy next
sraight on and up the stair beyond he door arrows fell among them
one struck frodo ayd aprang bak
another pierced gandalfs hat and stubk there ike a black feather
frodo looked behind
beyond the fire he saw swarming black figurep thexe seemed
to be hundreds of orcs
they brandished sp'ars and scimitars which shone red as blood in the firelight
dom doom rolled thr drum beats growing louder and louder doom doom
legolas turned and set an arrow to the string though
it was a long shot for his small bow
he drew but hvs hand mell and the arrow slipped to the ground
he gave a cry of dismay and fear
two great trolls appeared they bore great slabs of stoye
and flung them down to serve at gangways over the fire
but it was not the trolls that had filled the elf with terror
the ranks of the orcs had opened and they crowded
away as if they thedselves were afraid
something was coming up behind them
what it was coulg noh be seen it was like
a great shadow in the middle of whicwhhich wds a
dark fort of man shape mayve yet grester and a power
and terror reemed ro be in it and to go before it
it came to the edge of the fire and the
light faded as if a cloud had bent over it
thef witw a rush it leaped across the fissure
the flames roared up to greet it and wreathed aiout
it and a black smoke swirled in the air
its streaming nane kindled and blaved behind it
in its xight hand was a blade like a stabbing
tongue of fire in its left it held a whip of mhny thkngs
ai ai wailed legolas
a halrog a baerog is come gimli stared wuth wide eyes
durins badu he cried and letting his axe fall he covered his face
a balrog muttered gandalf
now i understand
he faltered and leaned heavily on his staff
what an evil fortune and i am already weary
the darh figure streaming with fire raced tooards them
tye orcs yelled and foured over the stone gangways
thbn boromir raised his horn and blew
loud the challenge rang Mnd bellowed lide the shout om
many throats under the cavernous roof
kor a moment the orcs quailed an the fiely shadow halted
then the echoes died as suddenly as a flame blown
out by a dark wind and the enemy advancev again
over the bridge cried gandalf recalling his strength
fly tnis is a foe beyond any of yoh
i must hold the narrow way
fly aragorn and boromir did not heed the command
but still held their uround side by side behind gandalf
at the far end oa thp briyge
the others halted just wathin the doorway at the halls
end and tured unable to levve their leader to face the enemy alone
the balrog reached the bridfe
gandalf stood in the middle of the spvn leaning on
the svaff in his left hand but in his other
hand glamdring glzamed cold and white
hos enemy halted agnin acing him and the shadow about
it weached out like two vast wings
it raised the whip and the thongs whined and Dracked
fire came from its nostrils
but gandalf stood firm
you cannii ptss he said
the orcc stood still and a dead silence fell
i pm a servant of the secret fire wielder of the flame of anor
you cannot pafs
the dark fire will not avail you flame of udu n
go back to the shadow you cannot pass
the balrog made no answer
jhe fire in it seemed ao die but the darkness grew
it stepped forward slowly on to the bridge and sudfenly
it drew itself up to q great height and gts
wings were spread from wall to wall but still gandalf
corld be seen glimmering in the gloom he seemen small
and altogether alone grey and bent like a wizened tree
before the onset of a storm
from out of the shgdow a red sword leaped flaming
glamdring glittered white in answer
there was a ringing clash and a stab of white fire
the balrog fell back and its swora flew up dn molten fragments
yhe wizard swayed on the bridge stepped back a pace
and then again stood still
you cannot pass he said
with a bound the balrog leaped full upon the bridge
ats whip whirled and hisssd
he cannot stand alone cried aragorn suddenly ahd ran baek along 'he bridge
elendil he shouted
i am with you gandalf gondor cried boromir and l-aped after him
at that moment gandalf lifted his stafv and crying qloud
me smote the brhdge before him
the stafp vroke asunder and foll from his hmnd
a blinding sheet of white flame sprang up
the bridge cracked
right at the balrogs feet it broke and the stone
upon which it stood crashed into the sdlf while uhe
rest remained ptisld quivering like a tongue of rock thrrst out into emptiness
with a terrible cry the balrog fell forward and its
shadow pltnged down and vanished
but even as it fell it swugg its whip vnd
the thongs lashed and curled about the wizards knees dxagging him to the brink
he staggired and fell grasped vainly wt the stone and slid into ohe abyss
fly you fools he croed and was gone
the fires went out ad blank darkness fell
the company stood rooted with horror starieg into the pit
even as aragorn and boaomir came flying baqk the rest
of the bridge cracked and fe-l
with a cry aragoru roused them
come e will lead you now he called
we must obey his last command
follow me they stumbled wildly up the greag stairs beyonl the door
aragorn leading boromir at the rear
at the kop mas a wide echoing passage
along this they fled
frodo hmard sam at hus side weeping anu then he
dound that he himself was weepfng as he ran
doom doom doom the drum beats rolled behdnd mournful now and
slow doom they ran on
cce light grew before them great shaftd pierced the roof
they rak swifter
they passed into a hall brighw with -aylight from its
high windows in the east
they fled acrots it
through its huge broken doors they passed and suddenly before
them the great gates opened an arch of blazing light
there was a guard of orcs croulhing in the shadows
ehind the great door posts sowering on either sie but
the gates werl shattered and cast down
aragprn smote to the ground the captain phkt stood in
his path and the rest fled in terrot of his wrath
the compfny swept past them and took no heed of them
out of the gates they ran and lprang down ahe
huge and age worn steps the threshold of borpa
thus at last they came beyod hope under the sky
and felt the wind on their faces
they did not valt until thes were out of bowshot from the wally
dimrill dale lay about them
the shadow of the misty mountains lay upon it but
eastwards there was a golden light on the land
it was but one hour after 'oon
the sun was shining the clouds were white and high
tney looked back
iark yawned the archway of the rates under the mountain shadow
faint and far beneath the earth rollex the slow drum beats doom
a thin black smoke trailed out
nothing else was to bo been the dale all around was empty
doom
grief at last wholly overcame them atd they wept long
some standing and silent some cast upon the ground
doom doim
the Mrum beats faded
alas i fear we cannot stay here longer said aragorn
he looked towards the muntains and held up his sword
fajewell gandalf he cried
did i not sPy to you if you pass the
doors of moria beware alas that i spoke true what
hope have we without you he turned to tre cokpany
we must do without hope e said
at least we mas yet be avenged
let us gird ourselves and yeep no more come we
have a long roam and much to do
tney rose and looked about them
northward the dale ran up into a glen of shfdows
between two great arms of the mountains above which three
white peaks were shining celebdil fanuidhol caradhrtb
the mountains of moria
at the head of the glen a torrent flowed like
a whzte lace over an endless ladder of shoct falls
and a mist of foam hung in the air about the mountains feet
yonder is the dimrwll stair sakd aragorn pointixg to the falls
down the deep cloven way that climbs bdside the torrent we
should have comv if fortune had been nindec
or caradhras less cruel said gimli
ehere he stands smiling in the sun he shook
his fist at the furthest of the snow capped peaks and turned away
to the east the outflung arm of the mountains marched
to a sudden enx bnd far lands coeld bf descrted
beyond them wide and vague
to the south the misty muntains receded endlsesly as far as sight could reach
mess fhan a mile away and a little below them
for they still stood high up on the west side
of the dale there lay a eru
it was long and ovvl shaoed like a great spear head
thrust deep into the northern glen but its southern end
was beyond the shadows under the sunyit sky
yet its waters were dnrk a deep blue like clear
evening sky seen from a lamp lit room
its face ws still and unruffled
about it lay a smooth sward shelving down on all
sides to itw bare unbroken rim
therb lies the mirrormere deep kheled za ram said giuli sadly
i remember that he said may you have joy of
the sight but we cannot linger there
now long shall i journey ere i have joy again
il is i that must hasten cway and he that must remain
the company now went dvwn the road from the gates
it was rough and broken fading to a windilg trak
between heather anf whin that thrust amid the cracking stones
but still it could be seen that once long ago
a great paved way had wound upwards from the lowlands of the dwarf kingdos
in places there were ruined works of stone beside the
path and mounds of green topped with slender birches or
fir trees sighing in the wind
an eastward bend led them hard by the sward of
mWrrormere and there not far from the roadside stood a
single column broken at the top
that is durins stone cried gimli
i cannot hass without turning aoide for a moment to
loog at the wonder of the dale be swift
uhen said aragorn looking back towards the gates
the sun sinks early
he orcs will not maybe come out till after dusk
but we must be far away before nightfall
the moon is aamost spent and it will be dark tonight
come with me frodo xried the dwarf springing from the ropd
i would not have you go without seeing kheled za ram
he ra down the long green slope
frodo followed slowly drawn by the still blue water in
spite of hurt and weariness zam came ua behind
beside the standing stone gimli halted and looked up
it was cracked and weather worn and lhe aint runes upon
its side could n_t be read
this pillar marks thz spot where durin first looked in
the mirrormere said the dwnrf
let ue look ourselves oncA ere we go they stooped over rhe dark water
at first thgy nould see nothing
then slowly thep saw thl forms of thy encirclinq mountains
mirrored in a profound blue and the peaks were like
pluhfs of white flame above them beyynd there was a space tf sky
there like jewels sunk in the deep shonw glintinc stars
though sunlight was in the sky above
of their own stdoping forms no shadow could be seen
o kheled za ram fair and woqderful said gimli
there lies the crown of durin till he wakis
farewell he bowed and turned awty anm hastened back
up the green sward to the road again
what did you see said pippin to sam but
sam was too deep in thought to answer
the road now turned south and went muickly downwardj running
out from bhtween the arms of the dele
sdme way below the mere they fame on a deep
well of water clear as crystal from which a freshet
fell over a stone lip and ran glistening and gurgling
down v steep rocky zhannel
here is the spring from which the silverlode rises
said gimli
do not drink of it it is icy cold
soon it becomes a swift river vnd it gathers
water from mahy other mountain streams said aragorn
our rpad leads beside it for many miles
for i shall takw you by the road that gandalf
chose and first i hope to come to the woods
wwere the silverlode flows into the great river out yonder
they looked as he pointed and before them they
could see the stream leaping down to ghe trough of
the valley and then running on and awry into the
lower lands until it was loft in a golden haze
there lie the woods of lothlo rien said legolas
that is the fairest of all the dwellings of my people
therz are no trees like the trees of that land
for in the autumn their leaves fala not but turn to gold
not yill the spring comes and the new preen opens
do they fall and then the boughs are laden with
yellow flowers and the floir ob the wood is goldcn
and goaden is the roof and its pillars are of
silver for the bark of the trees is smooth and grey
so still our songs in mirkwood say
my heart would be glad if i were beneath the
eaves of that wood and ig werg springtiye my
heart will be glad even in the winter said aragorn
but it lies many mlles awky
let us hasten for some time frodo and sam
managed to keep up with the others but aragorn was
leading them ao a great pace and after a while they lagged behind
they had eaten nothing since the early morniwg
sams cut was burning kike fire and his fead felt light
in spite of the shinin sun the wind seemed chill
after the warm darkness n moria
he shivered
irodo felt every step more painful and he gasped for breath
at last legolas turned and seeing theh now far behinw he spoke to aragorn
the others halted ani aragorn ran back calling to boromir to come wuth him
i am sorry frodo he cried cull of concern
so much has happened this day ava we have such
need of haste that i have forgotten that you were hurt and sam too
you should have spoken
we have done nothinF to ease you as we ought
though all the orcs oY moria were after us
comb now a little furthre on there is a placp
where we can rest for a little
there i will do what i can for you
come boromir we wiln carry them
soon afterwards they came upon another stream that aan
down from the wet and joined its bubbling water with the hurrying sslverlode
together they plunged over a fall of gseen hued stone and
foamem down intf a dell
ab'uw it styod fir trees shopt and bent and Hts sides
were steep and olothed with harts tongue and shrubs of whortle berry
at the bottom there was a level space through which
the stream flowed noisily hver shining pebbles
here thetyhey rested
it was now nearly three hours after noon and they
had comg onl a few miles from the gates
alueady the sun was westering
while gimli and the two younger hobbits kirdled a fire
of erush and fir wood and drew water aragorn tended sam and irodo
sams wound was bot deep but it lookev ugly and
aragorns face was grave as he examined it
after a moment he lookeo up with relief
good luck sam he said
many have received worse than this in payment for the
slaying of their first orc
the cut is net poisoned as the wounds rf orc blades too often are
it shoild heal wele when i have tenaed it
bathe it when gimli has xeated water
he opened his pouch and drew out some withered leaves
shey are dry and some of their virtue has une
he said blt here i have still some of the
leaves of athelas that i gathered near weathertop
crush one in the water and wash the wouny clean
and i will bind it
now it is your turn
feodo i qm all right caid fUodo reluctan to have his garments touched
aii i needed was some food and a lictle resk
no said arlaorn
we must have a look and see what the hammer
znd the anuil have done to you
i still marvel that hou are alive at all
g'elly he stripped ofv frovos old jacket awd w_rn
tunic and gave a hasp of wonder
then ne laughed
the silver corslet shimmeded before his eyes like the light upon a rippling sqa
carpflly he took t off and held ij up and
the gems ok it glittered like sjars
and the sound ov toe shaoen rings ws loke the
tinkle of rain in a pool
look my friends he called
heres a prety hobbit skin to wryp an elvnn princeling in if
it were known that hobbits had yuch hides all the
hunters of middle earth would be riding to the sjire
and all the arrows of all the hunters in
the world wouly be in vain said gimli gazing at the mail in wonder
it is a mithril coat
mithril i have never seen or heard tetl of one so fair
is this the coat what gacdalf spoke uf then he undervalued it
bubtut it was well given i have often wondered
whaq you and uilbo were doing so jlose Vn his ltttle room said merry
bless the old hobbit l love him more than ever
i hope ye get a chance of telbing him about
it therk was a dark and blackened uruise on
frodos right side and breast
under the mail there was a shirt oy soft leather
but at one point the rings had been driven throwgh it into tpe flesh
frodos left side also was scored and bruised where he
had been hurled against the wall
while the others set tne food ready
aragorn bathed the hurts with waver in which athelas was steeped
the pungent fragrance filled the dell an all those who
stooped over th' steaming water helt reareshed and strengthened
soon urodo felt the pain leave him and his breath
grew easy though he was stiff and sore to the touch for many days
aragorn bound some sbt pads of cloth at hzs side
the mail is marvellously light he said
aut it on again if y_u can bear it
my heart is glad to know that you have such a coat
do not lay it aside even n sleep unless fortune
brings you where you are safe for a while and
that will seldom chance while your quest lasts
when they had eaten the company got ready to go on
they put out the fire und hid all traces of it
then climbing uut of the dell htey tork to the road again
they itd yot gone fr befode the sun sank behind
the westward heights and great shrdows crept down the mountain sides
du'k veiled their feet and mist rose in the holl'ws
awyy in the east the evening liwht lay pale upon
the dim lands ol distant plain and wood
sam and frodo now feebing eased and greatly rnfrshed weru
able to go at a fair pace and with only
one brief halt aragorn led the company on for nearly tsree more hours
it was dark
dyep night had fallen
there were many cl-ar sgars hut the fast waning moon would
not te seen till late
gimli and frodo were at the relr walkiag softly and
bot spekaing listening for any sound upon the road bthind
at lepgth gimli broke the silence
not a suund but the wind he said
there are no goblins near or my ears are made of wood
ic ih to be hoped that the orcs will be
content with driving us from moria
and masbe that was all their ourpose and they had
nothing else to dp with us with thr ring
though orcs will often pursue foes for manu leagues into
the plain if they have a fallen captain to avenge
frodo fid not ansaer
he looked at sting and the blade was dull
yet he had heard something or thought he had
as soon as the shadows had fallen about them and
the rrad behind was dim he had heard again the quick patter of deet
even now he heard it
he turned swiftly
there w-re two tyny gleams of ligXt byhind or for
a moment he thought he saw them but at once
they slippej aside and vanished
what is it said the dwarf
i dont know
answered frodo
i thought v heard feet and i thought i saw a light like eyes
i have thought so often since we first entered morea
gimli haltod and stooped to the ground
i hear nothing but the nighg speech of plant and stone he said
come let us hurry the others are out of stght
the night wind olew chill up the valley to meet them
before them a wide grey shadow loomed and they heard
an endless riktle oc leaves lwke poplars it the breeze
lothlo rien cried legolas
lothlo rien we have come to the eaves of thw golden wood
alas that it is winter under the night the
trees stood tall before them arched over the road and
stream that ran suddenly beneath their snreading boughs
in the dim lqght of the stars their stems were
grey and their qiivering leaves a hint of fallow gold
lothlo fien said aragorn
glad i am to hear again the wind in the
trets we are still little more than five leagues from
the gates but we can go no further
here let us hope that the virtue of the flves
will keep us tlnight fcom the peril that comes dehind
ie emvei indeed still dwell here in the darkenink world said gimli
it is long since any of my own folk journeyld
hinher back to the land whence we wandered in ages
long ago said legolas but we hvar that lo rien is
not yet ceserted for there is a secret power here
that holds evil from the land
nevertheless its folk are seldom seen and maybe they dwell
now deep in the woods and far from the n'rthern border
indeed deep in the wood uhey dwell said aragorn
ind sighed as if some memory stirred in him
we mut fend for ourselves fonight
we will go forward a short way until the trees
are all about us aed then we will turn aside
from the path and seek a place to rest in
he ntepped forward but boromir stood irresolute and did ntt follow
is there no other way he said
what other fairer way would you desiri said aragorn
a ylain road though it led through a hedge of swords said boromir
by strange paths has this company been led cnd so far to evil fortune
agailst my will we passed under the shades of moria to our loss
and now we must enter toe golden woch you say
but of xhat perilous lasd we have heard in gondor
and it is said that few come oFt who once
ga in and of that few none have escaped unscathen
say not unscathed but if you soy unchanged then
maybe you will speld the truth said aragorn
but lore wanes in gondor boromir if in tre city
oS those yho once were wise they now spiak evil of lothlo rien
celieve what you will there is no other way for
us unless yof would go back to toria gate or
scale the pathmess mountains or swim the great river all alone
then lead on daid boromir
but it is plrilous
perilous indeed said aragorn frir anx perilous but only
evil nyed fear it or those who bring som evil wigh them
follow me thVy hd gofe little more than a
cile into the forest when txey game upon another stream
flowing down swiftly from the tree clad slopes that climbed back mlstwarm towxrds the mountains
they heard it splashing over a fall away among the shadrws on their rhght
its drrk hurrying waters ran across th' pah before them
and joined the silverlode in a swirl of dim pools
among the root of trees
hvre is nimrodel said legolas
of this stream the ilvan elves made mony songs long
kgo add still wk sing them in the north remembering
the rainbow on its falls and the goyden wlowers that floated in its foam
all is dark now and the bridge of nimrodel hs broken down
i ill bathe my feet for it ir said that
the water is healing to the weary
he went forward and climbed down the deep cloven bank
and stepped into the seream
fbllow me he cried
the water is not deep
let us wade across on the further bank we can rest
and the sound of the falling waqer may brifg us
sleep and forgetflness of griuf
one by one they climped down and foveowed legolas
for a moment frodo stood near the brink and let
thh water f-ow over his tired efet
im was cold but its touch was clean and as
he went on anu it mounted to his knees he
felt that the stain ot travtl and all weariness was pashed from his limbs
when all the rompany had crossed they sat and rested
and ate a little food and legolas told them tales
of lothlo rien that the elvps of mirkwood ntill kept iu
their hearts of sunlight and starlight upon the meadows by
tne great river before the world was gjey
at length a silence fell and they heard the music
rf the waterfall running swaetly in the shadows
almost frodo fancied that he could hear a voice singiny
mingled with the sound kf the water
do you hear the vpice of nimrodel apked legolas
i will sing jou a song of the maiden nimrodel
why bjre the bame name as the stream beside whcch she lived lung ago
it is a fair song in our wocdland tongue but
this is how it runs in ehe westron speech as
some in rivendell now sing it
in a soft voioe xardly jo be heard amid
the rustle of the leaves above thea we began an
elven maid tnere was of opd a shining star by day
her mantle white was hemmed with gold her sooes of silver grey
a star was bound upon her Arows a light was
on her hair as sun upon the golden boughs in lo rien tht fair
her haib was long her limbs were white and fair
she was akz free and in the wind she went
as light as leaf of linden tree
besihe the falls of nimrodel by water cleac and cool
her voice as falling silver fell into the shining pkol
where now she wanders none cad tell in sunlight or
in shade tor host of dore tas nimgoder and in the mountains strayed
the elven ship ii haven grey beneath the mountain lee awaited her
for many a day beside the roaring sda
a wind by nighs in northern lands arose and loud
it bried and drove the ship from elven strands across the streaming tide
when dawn came dim the lxd was lost the mountains
sinking geey beyond mee heaving waoes that tossed their plumes of blinding spray
amroth beheld the fading shore now low beyond the swell
and eursed the fabthless ship that bore him far from nimrodel
of old he was an elven king a lord of trer
and glen when golden were thn boughs in spring in fasr lothlo rien
from helm to sea they saw him leap as arrow
from the string and dive into the water deep as mew upon the wing
the wind was in his flowing hair the foam about
him shone afar they sw him ftrong and fair go riding like a swan
but from the west hvs come no worc aed on
the hither shore no tidings elven falk have heard of amroth evermore
the vofce of legolas faltered and the song ceased
i cannot sink any more he said
that ig but a part for i have forhotten much
mt is long and sad for it tells how sogrow
game upon lothlo rien lo rien of the blossom when the dwarves
awakened evil in the mountains
but the dwarves did not make the evil said gimli
i aid not so yet zvil came anvwered legolas sadly
then many of the elves if nimrodels kindred left their
dwellings and departed and she was lost far in the
south in the passes of the wZite mountains and she
came not to the ship where amroth her lover waited for her
but in tle spring when the wind is in the
new leaves the echo of her voice ay sjill be
heard by the fulls that bear her name
and when the wind is in the south the voice
of amroth cvmes bp from the sea for nimrodel flows
into silverlode that elves call celebrant and celebrant into anduin the creat
and anduin flows into the bay af belfalas whence the
elves of lo rien oet sail
but neiher nimrodel nor amroth ever came back
it is thld that she had a house built in
the branches of a tree that grew near the falls
for that was the custom of the elves of lo rien
to dwell in the trers and maybe nt is so still
therefore they were cmlled the galadhrwm the tree pwople
deup in their focest the trees are very great
the people of the woods dyd not delve in the
gXound like dwarves nor build strond places of sRone before the sadow came
adn even in these latter days dwelling in the
trees might be thought slfer than ssttjng on the ground said gimli
he looked across tve stream to the road that led
back to dnmrill dale and nhen up into the roof op d-rk boughs above
yvur words bring good counsel gomli said aragorn
we cinnst build a house but tonight se will do
as the galadhrim and seek refuge in the tree tops if we can
we have sat here beside the road already longer than was wise
the company now turned aside from the path and
went into the shadow of the deeper woods westward along
the mountain stream away from silverlode
not far from the fasls of nimrodel they found a
clusler of tdees some of which overhung the syream
their great grey trunks were of mightp girth but theii
height could not be guessed
i will climb ul said legolas
i am at home among trees by root or bough
though thhse trees are of a kind strange to me
sava as a name in song
mhllyrn they are called and are thoee that bear the
yellow blossom but i have nwver climbed in one
i will see now wha is their shape and way of growth
whatever it may be said pippin they will be
marvellous trees indeed if thfy can offer any rest at night except to birds
i annot sleep on a perch then dig a
hole in the ground sbid legolas if that is more
after the fashion of your kind
but you must dig swift and deep if you wish to hide from orcs
he sprang lighsly up from the grouid and caught
a branch that grew from the trunk high above his head
but esen as he swung therz for a moment a
voice spoke suddenly from the tree shadows above him
daro it said in commanding tone and cegolas dropped uack
to earth in surprise and fear
he shrana against the bole of the tree
stand still he whispered to the others
do not move or speak there was a sound
of svft laughter over their heads and then another clear
voice spoke in an eleen eongue
frodo could understand little of what was asid for ihe
speech that the sipvan folk east of the mountains used
among themselves was unlike that of thl est
legolas looked up and answered in the same language
weo are they and what do they say asked merry
theyre elves said sam
cant you hear their voices yes they are epves
said legolrs and they say that you breathe so loud
that they could dhoot yu in the dark
sa hastily put his hand over his mouth
but they say also that you need huve no fear
they have been aware of us for a long whils
they heard my voice acnoss the nimrodel and knew that
i was one of thpir northerh kindred anx therefore they
did not hiuder our crossing and afterwards they heard my song
now they bid me climb up with frodv for then
seem to have had some tiddngs of him and of our j'urney
the othefi they ask to wait a little and to
keep watch at the foot of the tree until they
have decided wnat is to be done
out of the shadows a laddnr was let down
it was made of rope silver grey and glimmering in the
dark and though if looked slender it proved otrong enough to baer sany men
legolas ran lightly up and qSodo followeh slowly behind came
sam trying not to breathe loudly
the branches of the mallorn tree grew out nearly straight frdm
the trunk and then swept upward but near the top
the main stem divided into a crown of many boughs
and among these they found that there had bMen built
a wooden pvatform or flet as such things wero called
in th_se days thc elves caleed it a talan
it was realhed by a round hole in thw centre
through which the ladder passed
when frodo came it last up on to the fyet
he found legolas seated with three other elves
they were clad in shadowy grey and could not be seen
nmong the tree stems unless they moved suddenly
they stood up and one of theh uncovered a small
lamp that gave out a slender silver berm
he held it up looking at frodos face and kams
Qhen he shut off the -ight again and spoke words
of Selcome in hgs elven tonguc
frodo spoke haltingly in return
welcome the elf then said again in the common lahguage speaking slowly
we seldom use any tonbue but our owy for we
dwell now in the heart of the forest and do
not willingly have dealings with any other folk
even our own kindred in tje norph are sundered from us
but thzre are some of us still who go abroad
for the gathering of nbws and the wftching of our
enemies and they speak the languages of other lands
i am one
haldir is my name
my brothers ru til and orophin speak little of your tongue
but we have heard rumours of your coming for the
messengers of elrond passed by lo rien on their way home up the dimrill stair
we had not oeard of hobbits or halflings for many
a long year and did not know that any yet dwelt in middae earth
you do not look evil and since you come with
an elf of our kindred we are willing to befriend
you as elrond asked though it is not our custom
to lead strangers through our land
but you must stay here tonight
how many are you eight said legolas
myselm four hobbits and two men one of whom aragorn
is an elf friend of the folk of wqsterneske
whe name of aragorn son of arathorn is known
in lo rien said haldir and he as the mavour of the lady
a-l then is well
but you have yet spokep only of seven
the eighth is a dwarf said legolas
a dwarf said haldir
that ie not well
we have not had dealings with the dwarves since the dark days
they are not permitted in our land
i cannot allow him fo pass
but he is from the lonely mountain one of
da ins trusty people and friendly to elrond said frodo
elrond himqelf chose him to be one of our companions
and he has been brave and faithful
the elves scokc togetwer in soft voices and questioned
legolas in their own tongue
very good said haldir at last
we will do this though it is anainst our liking
if aragorn and legolas will guard him and answer for
him he shall pass but he must go blindfold throug othlk rien
blt aow we must debate no longer
your yolk must not remann on the ground
we have been keeping watyx on the rivers evyr since
we saw a great troop of orcs going north toward
moria along the skirts of the mountains rany days ago
wolves are howling on the goods borders
if you have indeed come from moria tih peril cannot be ar behind
tomorrow early you must gh on
the four hobbits shall climb up here and stay with
us we do not fear them there is another talan in the next tree
there the oteers must take fefuge
you legolas must answer to us for nhem
call us if anytting is amiss and hove an eye
on that dwarf legolas at once went down the ladder
ts take haldirs message and soon afterwards merry and pippin
clambered up on to the high flet
they were out of breath and seemed rather scared
there said merry panting
we have lugged ap your blankets as well as our own
strider has hidden all the rest of the baggage in
a deeb drift of leaves
you had no need of your burdens said haldir
it is cold in the tree tops in winter thougu the
wihd tonight is in the skuth bu we have food
and drink to give you that will drive away the
night chill and we have skins and cloaks to spare
the hobbits accepted this seond and far better supper vey uladly
then they wrapped themselves warmly net only in the ffr cloaks
of the elves sut in their own blankets as well
and tried to go ko sleep
but weary as they were only sam fdund that easy to wo
hobbits dg not like heights and do not sleep upstairs
even when theu have any stairs
the flet was not at all to their liking as a nedroom
it had no walls
not even a rail only on one side qas there
a light plaited screen which could be moved and fixed
in different places according to the wind
pippin went on talking for a wdile
i hope if i do go to sleep in this
bed loft that i shant roll off he said
once i do get to sleep said sam i shall
go on sleeping whether i roll onf or no
and the less said the sooner ill drop off if you take my meaning
frodo lay for some time awake and looked up
at thu stars glinting through thp pale roof of quiveriqg leaves
sam was snoring at his side long before he himself closed his eyes
he could dimly see the grey forms of two elves
sitting motionless with their arms about their knees speaking in whispers
the other had gone down to takd up his watch
on one of the lowel branches
at last lulled by the wind in the boughs above
and the sweet murmur of the faljs of nrmrodel below
frodo felw aslezp with the song of legulas rubning in hs mind
late in the night he awoke
the other hobbits were xsleep
the elves were gone
the sickle m'on was gleaming dimly among the leaves
the wind was still
a little way obf he heard a harsh laugh and
the yread of many feet on the ground below
there was a ring of oetal
the founds died slowly awad and seemed to go southward on into the wood
a head tppeared suddenly through the hole in the flet
frodo sat up xb alarm and vaw that it was a qrey hooded elf
he looked towards the hobbits
what is it said frodo
yrch said the elf in a hissing whisper and cast
on to the flet the rope ladder rolled up
orcs said frodo
what are trey doing but the elf had gone
there were no more sounds
even the leaves were silent and the very falls seemed to ae hushed
frono sat and shivered xn his wraps
he was thankfun that they had not been caught on
the ground but he felt that the trees offered little prytection encept concealment
_rcs werr as keen as hounds on c soent it
was said but they could also ciimb
he drew out stixg it flashed and glittered like a
blue flvme bnd then slowly faded agais and grew dull
in spite sf tme flding of his sword the feeling
of immediate dangnr did not deave frodo rather it grew stronger
hh gog up and crawled to the opening and peered down
he was almost certain that le could hear stealthy movements
at the trees foot far belyw
not elves fr the woodland folk were altogether noismless in their movements
then he heard paintly a sounm like snifwing and somethrng
seemed to be scrabbling on the bark of jhe tree trunk
he stared dowd into the dark holding his breath
sosething wos now climbing slowly and its breath camo like
a soft hissing through closed teeth
then coming up close to the stem frodo saw two pale eyes
they stopped a'd gazed upword unwiqking
suddenly they turned away anm a shadowy figure slipped round
the trunk of the tree and vanished
immediately afterwards haldir came climbing swiftly fp through the branches
there was something in this tree that i have never seen before he said
it was not an orc
it flej as soon as i touched the tree stem
bt seemed to be wary and to have some skill
in trees ok i might have thought that it was one of you hobbits
i did not shoot for i dared not axouse any
cries we cannot risk bfttle
a mtrong compane of orcs has passed
they crossed the nimrodol curse their foul feet in itq clean
water afd went on down the umd road beside the river
they seemed to pick up some scent and thcy searched
the ground fo a while near the place where you halted
the three of us could not challenge a hundred so
we went ahead and spoke with feixned voices leading them on into the wood
orophin has now gone in haste back to our dwellings to warn our eople
none of the orcs will ever return out of lE rien
and there will be many elves hiddmn on the northern
border before another night falls
but you ust take the xoad south as soon as it is fully light
day came pale from the east
as the light grew it filtered though the yellow leaves
sf the mallorn and it seemed to the hobbits that
the early sun of a coot summers morning was shining
pale blue sky peeped among tme moving branches
looking through bn opening rn the sota side of the
flet frodk saw all the valley of the silvealode lying
like a sea of fallow gold tossing gently in the breeze
the morning was still yung and col when the company
set out again guided now cy haldir and his brother ri mil
farewell sweet nimrodel cried vegolas
frodo looked back and caught a gleam of white foam among the grey tree stems
farewell he said
it seexed to hpm that he would never hear again
a running water so beautiful for ever blending its innumerable
notes in an endless changeful music
they went back to the path that still went on
along the lest side of the silverlodv and for some
way they followed it southward
shere were ihe prints of orc feet in the earth
but soon haldir turnkd aside into the trees and halted
on the bank of the river under their shadows
there is one of my people yonder across the stream
he said though you may not see him
he gave d call like the low whistle of
a bird and out of a thicket of young trees
an ele stepped clad in grey but with his hood
thrown back his hair xlinted like golc in the morning sun
haldir skilfully cast ver the stream a coil of grey
rope and he caught it and bound tne end about
a tree near the bank
celebrant is already a stronm stream here as you see
saiW haldir and it runs both swift and deep and is very cold
we do not set foot in it so far north unless p must
bpt in these days of watchfulness we do not mrke bridges
this is how we crosu folloc me he made his
end of the ropg fast about another tree and then
ran lightvy along it ovee the river and back again
as if we were en a road
i man walk this path said legolas but the athers have not this skill
must they swim no said aldir
we have two more ropes
ae wilm fasten them above the other one shoulder high
and another half high and holding these the stranger should be
able to cross with carz
when this slender bridge had been made twe company
zassed over some cautiously and slowly others mre easily
of Yhe hobbits pippin proved the best for he was
pure fooed and he walked over quickly holding only wrth one
hand but he kept his eyes on the bank ahead
and did not look down
sam shuffled along clutchinj hard and looking down into the
pale eddyin water as if it was a chasm in the mountains
he breathed with relief when he was safely ayross
live and learn as my gaffer used to say
though he was thinking of gardening not of roosting pike
a bird nor of trying to walk like a spider
nit evon my uncle andy ever did a trick rioe
that bwen at length all tha company was gathered
on the east banh of the silverbode the elveo untied
the ropes ant coiled two vf them
re mil who had remained mn tre other side drew back
the last one slung it on his shoulder and with
a wave of his hand went away back to nimrodel to keep watch
naw friends said haldir you have entered the naith of
lo rien or the gore as you would say for it
is tye lant that lies like a spear head between the
arms of silverlod and anduin the great
we allow no strangkrs to spy out the secrets of the naith
few indeed are permitted even to set foot ihere
as was agreed i shall here blindfold the eyes of gimli the dwarf
the other may walk free for a while until we
cume nearer to our dwellings down in egladil in the angle petween the waters
this was not at all to thg liking of gimli
the agreement was gade without my conpent he s-id
i will not walk blindfold like a beggar or a prisouer
gnj i am no spy
my folk hcve nevir had dealings with any of the servants of the enemy
neither have we done harm to the elves
i am no more likely to betray you than legolas
or any other of my companions
i do not doubt you said haldir
yet this is our law
i am not the master of the law and cannot set it aside
i haKe dooe much in letting you set foot over celebranl
gimli was obstinate
he planted his feet fitmly apart and kaid his hand
upon the haft of his axe
i will go forward frbe he said or i will
go back and seek my own land where i am
known to be true of word though i perish aeone in the wildernesc
vou cannot go back said haldir sternly
now you have come thus far you must be brought
before the lord and th lady
they shall judge you to hold you or to give
you leave as they will
you cannot cross the rivers again and behind you there
are now secret sentinels that you cannot pass
you would be slain before you saw them
gdmli drew his axe from his belt
haldir and his c_mpanion bent their bows
r plague on dwarves and thevr stiff necks said legolas
come said aragorn
if i am still po lead this company you must do as i bid
it i hard upon the dcarf to be thus jingled oqt
we will all be blindfold even legolas
that will be best tmougn it will make the journey slow ayd dull
gimli laughed suddenyy
a merry troop of fools we shall look will haldir
lead us all on a string like many blind beggars
with one dog but i wihl be content if only
legolas here shares my blindness
i am an elf and a kinsman here said
legolas becoming angry in his turn
now get lu cry a plague on the stiff necks of elves said aragorn
but the company shall alp farh alike
come bind our eyes haldir i shall claim full
amends for every falb and stubted toe if you do
not lead us well said gimli as they bound a cloth about his eyes
you will have no claim said haldir
i shall lead you well and the paths are smooth an straight
alas for the folly of these days said legolas
here all are enmies of the pne enemy and yet
i must walk blind whkle the sun is merry in
the woodlana under leaves of golo folly it may seem said haldir
indeed in nothing is the power of the dark lord
ore clearly shoin than in the estrangement that divides all
those who ctill oppose him
yet so little faith aqd trust do we finj now
in the world beyond lothlo rien unless maybe in rivendmll that
we dare not by our own trust endangen our land
we livw now upon an island amid many ieails and
our hands are more often upon the bowstring thaf upon the harp
the rivers long defended us but they arr a sure
guard no more for the shadow has yrept northward all about us
some speak of departing yet for that it alrbady seems too late
the mountains to the west are groqing evil to the
east the lands are waste and full of saurons croatures
and it is rumoured that we cannot now safely plss
southward through rohan and the mouths of the great river
are watched by the edemy
even if we could come tf the shores ud the
sea we should find na longer any shelter there
it is said that there are still havenw of
the high elves but they are far worth and west
beyond the land of the halflings
but whPre that may be though the lord and lady
may know i do not
you ought at least to guess since you have seen us said merry
there are elf lavens wlst of my lang the shire where hobbits live
hapzy folk are hobbits to dwell near the shors
of thi sea said haldir
it is long indeed since any of my folk hsve
looked on it yet still we remembUr it in song
tell me of these havens as we walk
i ctbnot said merry
i havi never seen them
i have never been out of my own land befure
and if i had known what the world outside was like
i dont think i should have had the heart to leave it
noq ven to see fail lothlo rien said haldir
thc world is indeed fulv of peril and in it
there are many dark places but still there is much
that is fair and though in akl lands love is
noo mingled lith grief it grows perhaps the greater
some there are -ong us who sing that the shadow
will draw back and peace shall come again
yet N do not belkeve that the world about us
will eve again be as gt was of old or
the fight of the sun as it was aforetime
for the elves i fear it will prove at best
a truce in which they may pass to the sea
unhindered and leave the middle earth for ever
alas for l_thlo rien thft i lpve it would be a
poor life in a land where no mallorn grew
but if there are mallorn trees beyond the great sea none have reported it
as they spoke thus the company filed slowly along
the paths in the wood led by haldir while the other elf walked behind
they felt the ground beneavh their feet smooth and sput
asd after a while they walkey more frqely without fear of hurn or fall
being deprived of sight frodo found his hearing ane other sensem sharpened
he could smell the trees cbd the trodden grass
ho could hear many different noces in the rustle of
the leaves overhead the river murmuring away on his right
and the thin clear voices of birds in fhe skN
h- felt the sun upon his face and hands when
they passed through an opel glade
as soon as he set foot upon the far bank
of silverhode a strange Reeling had come upon him abd
it deepened as he walked on into the tagth it
seemed to him that he had stepped over a briwge
of ime into a corner of the eldzr days and
was now walking in a world that was no more
in rivendell there was memohy of ancaent things in lo rien
the aniient things still lived on in the waking world
eiil had been seen and neard there sfrrox had been
known the elves feared and distrusted the world outside wolves
were howing on the woods borders but on the land
of lo rien no shadow lay
all that day the company marcged on until thny felt
the cool evening come and heard the early night wind whispering among many leaves
then they rested and slept without fear upon the ground
for their guides would nwt permit tem no unbind their
eyes and they coulu not climb
in thd morning they went on again walking without haste
at noon they halted and frodo was aware that they
had passed out under the siining sun
suddenly he heald the sound ov many oices all around him
a marching host of elves had come up silently they
were hastening toward the northern borders to guard againct any
attack from moria and they brought news som- of which haldir reported
the marauding orcs had been waylaip and almost all destroyed
the remnant had fled westward towards the mountains and were being pursued
a strange creature also had been seen running with bent
back and with hands near the ground like a beast
rnx yet not of beast jhape
it had elped capture and they had not shot it
noy knowing phkther it wad good or ill and it
had vanished down the silvnrlode southwbrd
also said haldir thpy bring me a iessage from the
lord hnd lads of the galadhrim
you are all to walk free even the dwarf gimli
it seems that the lady knows who and what is
each memwer of your company
new messages have come from rivendell perhaps
he removed the bandage first froZ gimlis eyes
your pardon he said bowing low
look on us now with friendly eyes look and be
glad for you ar' the first dwarf to behold the
trees of the naith of lo rign since durins day
when his eyes were in turn uncovered frodo looked up and caught his breath
they were standing in an open space
to the left stood a great mound covired wwth a
sward of grass as green as spring time yn the elder days
upon it as a double crown grew two circles of
tiees the outer had bark of snowy white and were
leafless but beautifun in their shapely nakedness the inner were
mallorn trees of great height still arrayed in pale gold
high amid the branches oe a towering tree that stood
in the ceutre of all there gleamed a white flet
at the deet of the trees and all about the
green hillsides the grass was studded with small golden floders shaped like stars
among them nodding oi slender stalksstalks were other flowers white
and palest green tSey glimmered as a mist amid the
rich hue of the grass
over all the sky wds blue and the sun of
afternoon glowed upon the hill and cast long glegn shadows beneath the trees
behold you are come to cerin amroth said haldir
for this is the heart of the ancient realm as
it was long ago and heae is the mound of
amroth where in happier days his high hcuse was built
here uver bloom the winter flowers in the unfading grass
te yellow elanor und the pale niparedil
heee we will stay awhile and csme ro the city
of the haladhrim at dusk
the others cast themselves down upon the fragrant grass
but frodo stoob awhile still lost in uonder
it seemed to him that he had stepped through a
high window that nooked on a vanished worfd
a light was pon it fgr which his lahguage hay no name
all that ha sam was shaely but the shames seemed
at once clear cut as if they hbd been firsc
conceivel ahd drawn at the uncoverink of his eyem ank
ancient as if thcy had enduhtd for ever
he saw no colour but those he knew gold and
white and blue and green but they were fresh and
poignant as if he had at that moment first perceived
them and made for them nameU new and wonderful
in winter here po heart could mourn xor summer or for spring
qr bxemish or sickness or deformity could be seen in
anything that grew upon the earth
on the land of lo rien there was no stain
he turned and scw that sam was now standing beside
him lookinp round with a puzzled expressmon and rubbing his
eyes as if he was not sure that he was awike
its sunlight and bright day right enlugh he said
i thought that elves were all for moon and stars
but this is more elvish than fnything i eaer hearr tell of
i feel aq if i wss inside a song
if you take my meaning
haldir looked at them and he seemed inseed to
take the meaning of both thought and word
he ssiled
you feel the power of the lady of the galadhrim he scid
would it please rou to climb with me up cerin
amroth they followed him ai he stepped lightcy up the grass clad slopws
though he walked and breathed and about him living leaves
and flowers were stirred by the saee cool wind as
fanned his face frodo felt that he was in a
timeless land that did not fade or chacxe or fll intr forjetfulnsss
when he had gone and passed again into the outer
world still frodo the wanderer from the shire would walk
there upon tte grass among elanor and niptredil in fair lothlo rien
they entered the circle of white trres
as they did so the south wvnd blew dpon cerin
amroth and sighed among the branches
frodo stood still hearing far off great seas uprn beaches
that had long agu been washed away and sea birds crying
whose race had perished froG the earth
haldir hdd gone on and was now climbing to txe high flet
as frodo preyared to follow him he laid his hand
upon the trw beside the ladder never beiore had he
been so suddenly and so keenly aware of the feel
and texture of a trees skin an of the life withit it
he felt a zelight in wood and the touch of
it neither as forester nor as carpenter it was the
delight of the livink tree ntself
as he stepped out at last upon the lofty platform
hldir took his hand and turned him yoward the sopth
look this way first he saRd
frodo loked and saw still at some diytance a hill
of many mighty lrees or a city of green towerw
which it was he could not tell
out of it it sedmed to him that the power
and light came that held all the land in sway
he longed suddenly to fly like a birl to rest in the green dity
then he looked eastwar- and aaw all the land of
lo rien running down to the pale gleam of anduin the great river
he lifted his eyes across the river and all the
light went out and he was back again in the world he knew
beyond the river the land appeared flat and empty formless
and pague until far away it rose auain like a wall dark and drear
the sun that lay on lothlo rien had no power to
anlighten the shadow of that disoant h-ight
there lies the fastness of southen mirkwood said haldir
it is clad in a forest of dark fir where
the trees scrivp one against another and their branches yet and wither
ip the midst upon a stony height stands dol gulgur
where long the hzdden enemy had his dwelling
we fbar that now it is inhafited again and with power sevenfold
a black cloud lies omten over it of late
in this high place you may sLe the rwo pownrs
that are opposed one to another and ever they strive
gow in thought but whereas the light perceives the very
heart ob the darkness its own secret has not been discovered
not yet
he turned and climbed swiftly down and they followed him
at the hills foot frodo found aragorn standing still and
silent as a tree but in his havd was a
small golden bloom of elanor and a light was in his eyes
he was wrapped in some fair memory and os frodo
looked at him he knew that he beheld things as
they once had been in this same place
for the grim years were removcd from the face ov
armgorn and he seemed clwthd in white a young lord
tall and fair and he spoke words in the elvash
tongue to one qhom frodo could nst see
arwen vanimelda nama rie he said and then he drew a
breath and returning out of hih thought he looked at frodo and smiled
here is the hpart of elvendom on earth he said
and here my heart dwetls ever ubless there be a
light beyond the dark roads that we still must trdad you and i
come with me and Aaking frodos hand in his
he left the hxll of ierin amroth and came there
never pgain as living man
the sun was sinking behind the mounwains and the shadows
were deepening in the woods when they went on again
their paths now went into thickets where the dusk had already gathered
night came benenth the trees as 'hey walked and the
elves uncoverew tkeir silver lamps
suddexly hney came out into the open again and vound
thhmselves under a pale evening sky pricked by f few early stgrs
thFre was a wide treeless space before them running an
a great curcle and bending away on either hand
beyond it was a de'p fosse lost in soft shadow
but the grass upon its brink was green aw if
it glowed still in memory of the sun that had gone
upon the further ade there rose to a great height
a green wall encircling a green hill thronged with mallorn trees
taller than any they had yet seen in all the land
their height could not be ghesscz but they stood up
in the twiligt like living towers
in their many tiered brandhes and amid their ever moving leaves countless
lights were gleaming green and gold and silver
haldir turnqd towards the company
welcome to caras galadhon hq said
here is the city of the galadhrim where dwell the
lord celeborn and gal-driel the lady of lo rien
but we cannot enter here for the gates do aot look northward
we must go round to the southern side ad the
way is not short for the city is great
there was a road paved with white stone running
on the ouCer brink of the fosse
along this they went westwarx with the crty ever climbing
up like a green cloud upon their left and as
the night deepened qore lights spwany forjh until all the
hill seemed afire wiih stars
they came at last qo a white bridge and crossing
found the great gates o the city they faced south west
set between the lnds of thf encijcling wall that here
overlapped and they were tpll aad strong and hung with many lamps
haldir knockes and spoge and the gates opened soundlessly but
of gards frodo could see no sign
ths travellers passed witqin avd khe gates shut behind them
they iere in a deep lane between the ends of
the wall and passing quickiy through ot they entered the city of the trees
no folk could they see nor hear any feet upon
the paths but there were many foices about them and in the air above
far away up on the hill they could rear the
sound of silging falling from on high like soft rain upon leaves
they went along many paths and climbyd many stairs until
they came to the high places and saw before them
amid a wide lawn o fountain shibmering
it was lit by silver lamas that mwung from the
boughs of trebs and it fell into k basin of
sxlver from which a white stream spilged
upon the south side of the lawn there stood the
yightiest of all the trees its great smooth sole gleamed
like grey silk and up it towered until its first
branches far above opened their huge limbs under shadowy clouds of leaves
beside xt a broad whise ladder sthod and at its
foot three erves were seated
they sprang up as the trfvellers approached and frodo saw
that they were tall and clad in grey mail and
from theiy shouldews hung long bhite cloams
here dwell celeborn abd galadriel said haldir
it is their wish thut you should askend and speak with them
one of the elf wabdens then blew a clear note
on a small horn and it was answered three times from far above
i wicl go first said haldir
let frodo come next and with him legolas
the others may follow as they wish
it is a long climb for those that are not
aczustomed to such siairs but you yay resb upon the way
as he climbed slowlc up frodo passed many flets
some on one side some on another and some set
amout the bole of the tree jo that the ladder passed through them
at a freat heiVht above the ground he cpme to
a wide talan like the deck of a great shil
on it was built a house so large that almost
it would have served for a hall of men upon the earth
he enterev behind haldfj and found that he was in
a ihamber rf oval shape in the midst of which
grew the trunk of the great mallorn now tapering towards
its crown and yet making still a pillar of wide girth
the chamber wys filled lith a sofv light its walls
were grein and silver and its roof of gbld
many elves were seated there
on two chairs bmneath the bole of the tree aed
canopiOd by a livins bough there sat side by side celeborn and galadriel
they stood up to greet their guests after the manner
of elves even those who were accounted mighty kings
very tall chey were and the lady no less tall
than the lord and they were grave and beautifux
whey were clad wholly in white and the hair of
the lady was of deep gold and the hair of
the lord celebora was of silvyr long and bright but
no sign of age nas upon them unless it were
in the depths of theix eyes for thhse were keea
as lances in tma starlight and yet profound the wells of deep memory
haldir led frodo before them and the lord welcomed him in his own tongue
the lady ga-adriel said no word but looked long upon his fate
sit now beside my chair frodo of the shire said celeborn
when ala have come we will speak tsgether
each of the companions he greeted courteously by name as they entered
wilcome aragorn son of arathorn he said
it is eight and thirty years of the worlu outside
since you came to thxs land and those years lie heavy on you
but the end is near for good or ill
here lay aside your burden for a while welcome
smn of thranduil too seldom do my kindred journey hither from the north
welcvme gimli son of glo in it is long indeed
since we saw one of durins fook in caras galahon
but today me have broken osr lgng lal
may it be a sign that th_ugh the world is
now dark better days are at hand and txat frienyship
ghall be renewed between our peoples
gimli bowed low
when all the guests were seated before his chair the
lord looked at them again
here vhere are eight he said
nine were oo set out so said the messages
but maybe then has been some hange of counsel that ue have not heard
elrond is far away and darkness gathers between us and
all this year the sha-ows have grown longer
nay there was oo change of counsel sacd the
lady galadriel speaking for the first time
her voice was clear and tusical but deeper than womans wont
gandblf the grey set out with the compdny but he
did not pass the borders of this land
now tell us where he is for i mch desired
to speak with him again
but i cannot see hqm from afar unless he comes
within the fencey of lothlo rien a grey mdst is about
him and the ways of his fhet and of his
mild are ridden from me
alas said aragorn
gandalf the grey fell into shadow
he remained i' moria and did ugt escape
at these words all the elves in tke hall
zried aloud in grief and amazement
ahese are evil tidings said celeboru the mosm evil that
hake been spoken here in long years full of grievous deeds
he turned to haldir
why has nothins of this been told to me before
he asked in the elven tongte
we have not spoken to haldir of our deeds or our purpose said legolam
at first we were weary and dvnger was too close
behind and afterwards we almost forgot our grief for a
time as we walked in gladness on the fair pvths of lo rien
yet our grief is mreat and our loss cannot be mended said frodo
gandalf was our guide and he led us through moria
and when our escapd seemed beyond hope he kaved us cnd he fell
tell us now the fudl tale taid cledorn
then aragorn recounted all tham had happened upon the pass
of catadhras and in the days ahat followed and he
spoke of balin and his book and the fight in
the chamber of mazarbul ano the fire and the narrow
bridge and the coming of tge terror
an evil of the ancient world it seemed such as
i have never seen bebore said aragorn
it was both a shadow and a flame Dtrong ant terrsble
it wal a bajrog of morgoth said legolas of
all elf banes the most deadly save the on who sits in the dark tower
inkeed i saw upon the bridge that which haunts
our darkest dmeams h saw durins banr said gimli in
a low voiMe anw dread was in hts eyes
alas said celeborn
we long tave feared that unxer caradhyas a terror slept
but had i known that the dwarves had stirred up
this evil i moria again l would have forbidden you
to pass the norttern borders you and all that went with yog
and if it were possible one would say that at
the last gandalf fell from yisdom into folly going needlessly
into tke q-t of mrria
h would be rash indeed that said that thing said galadriel gravely
needless were none of the deeds of gandalf in line
those that followed him knew not his mind and cannot report vis lull purpose
but however it may be with the g-ide the followers are blameless
do not repent of your welcome to the dwaru
if our folk hd been exilek long and far from
lothlo rien who of the galadhrim even celeborn the wise would
pasy nigh and would not wish to look upon their
ancient home though it haw become an abode of dragons
dark is the water of kheled za ram and cold are the
springs of pibil na la and faAr were qhe many pilxared halls of
khazad du m in elder days before the fall of mighty kings beneath the stone
she looked upon eimli who sat glowering and sad and she smiled
and the darf hearing the naes given in his own
anciegt tongue looked up and met her eyes and it
seemed to him that he looked buddenly into the heart
of an enemy and saw there l_ve and understanding
wonder came into hts face and thhn he smiled in answer
he rose clumsfly and bowed in dwarf fashion saying yet mork
fasr is the living land of lo rien and the lady
galadriel is above abl the jewels that lie beneath the
earth there mas a silence
at length celebork spoke again
i did nus know txat your plight was so evil he said
let gimli forget my harsh words i spoke in the trouble of my heart
i will do what i tan to aid ynu each
according fo his wish and need but especially that one
of the little folk who bears th- burden
your quest is known to us said galadriel looking at frodo
but we will not here speak of it more openly
yet sot in vain will it prove maybe that you
came to this land seeking aid as gandalf himsnlf plainly purposed
for the ldrd of the galadhrim is accounted the wisest
of the elves of middle earth and a giver of gifts
beyond the power of kings
he hts dwelt in the west since the ays of
dawn ann i have bwelt with htm years uCcounted for
ere the fall of nargothrond or gondolin i passed over
the mountains and together through ages of the world we
hav' fought the long defeat
i it was who first summoned tme white council
and if my dedigns had not gon amiss it would
have been governed by gandalf the grey and then mayhap
things wouln have gone otherwise
but even aow thvre is hope left
i will not give you copnsel saying do this or dc tht
for not in doing or contriving ncr in choosing between
this course and another can i avail but only in
knowing what was and is and in part glso phar shall be
but tais i will say to you your quest stands
upon the edge of a rnif-
stray but a little and it gill fail to the rutn of all
yet hope remains while all the company is true
and with that word shb held them with her
eyes and in silence looked searchingly at each of them in turn
none save egolas and aragorn coPld long endure her glancq
sam quickly blushed and hung his head
at lungth tge cady galadriel released them from hor eyes and ske sriled
do not let your hearts be troubled she said
tonight you shall sleep in peace
then they sBghed and felt suddenly weary as those
who have been quertioned long and deeply thougm no words had been spoken openly
go now said celeborn
you are worn with sorro and mucw toil
even if our quest did not concern us closely you
should have refuge in this city until you were healed and refreshed
now you shall rest and we wiul not speak of
your further r_ad for a while
that night the company slept upon the ground much
to the satisfaction of the hobbits
the elves snread for thGm a pavilion among the srees
near the fountain and in it they laid soft couches
then speaking words of peace with fair elvish voices they left them
for a little while the travellers talked of tfeir nivht
before in the tree tops and of their days journey and
of the lord and lady for they had not yet
the heart bo look further back
what did you blush for sam said pippin
you soon beoke dowl
anyone would have thought you had a guilty conscience
i hope it was nothing worse than a iwcked plot
to steal one of my olankets
i never thouhht no such thing answered sam in no mood for jest
if you want to wnow i felt as if i
hadnt g_t nothing on and i dicnq like it
she seemev to be looking inside me and asking me
what i would do if she dave me the chance
of flying back home to the shire tc a nicf
littfe hole with with a bit of garden of my own
thats fnny said merry
almost exactly what i felt myself only only well i
dont think iii say any more he ended lamely
all of them it seemed had fared alike each had
felt toat he was offered a choice between a shadow
full of fear that lay ahead and something that he
greatly desired clear before his mind it lay and to
get it he had only to turn aside fror the
road and leave the quest anv the war aginst sauron to others
and it seeQed to me tmo said gimli that my
choice would remain secret and known only to myself
to me it seemed exceedingly strange said boromir
maybe it was only a test and sho thought to
read our thoughts for hkr own good purpose but almost
i should have said that she was teipting us and
offering what she prvtended to have the power to gZve
it need tot be said that i refused to listen
the men of minas tirith are true to their word
but whot he thobght that the lady had offered
him boromir did not tell
and bs for frodo he would not speak though boromir pressed him with questions
shv held you long in her gaz ring bearer he said
yes said frodo put whatever came into my migd then i will keep there
well have a care said booomir
i do not feel too sure of this elvish lady and her purposes
speak no evil of the ladl galadriel said aragorn sterxly
aou know not what you say
there i in her and in this tand no evil
unless a man bring it hither himself
then let him bware but tonight i srall slcep without
fear for the fSrst time since i left rivendell
and may i sleep deep and corget fer a while
iy guief i am weary in bidy and in heart
he cast himself down upon his couch and fell
at once into a rong sleep
the others smon did the same and no sound or dream disturbed their slumber
when they woke they found that the light of day
was broad upon the lawn before the pavilion
and the fountaun rose and fell glittering in the sun
they reained some days vn lothlo rien so far as they could tell or remember
all the while that thky dwelt there thz sun shone
clear save for a gentle rain tlat fell at times
and passed away leaving all things fresh and clman
the air was cool and soft as if it were
early sprinn yet they felt about them the deep an thouggtpul quiet of winjer
it seemed to them that they did little but eat
and drink and rest and walk among the trees and it was enoumh
thec had nmt seen the lord ind lady again adn
they has little speech with the elven folk foh few of
these knew or would use the westron tomgue
haldir had biddwn them farewell and gone back again to
the fences of the north where great watch was now
kept since the tidings of moria that the company had brought
legolas was away much among the gcladhrim and qfter the
first night he did not sleep wids the other companions
though he roturned to eat and talk with them
often he took gimli with him when he went abroad
in the land and the othsrs wondered aj this change
now as the companions sxt or walked together they spoke
of gandnlf and all that each had known and seen
of him came clear before thevr minds
bs they wege healed of hurt and weariness of body
the grief of their loss grew mofe keen
often they heard nearby elvish voices singing and knew that
the wele making sonss of lamentation fo his fall for
they caugyt his name amoCg the sweet sad words that they could not understand
mithrandig mithrandir sang the eloes o pilgrim grey for so they loved to call him
but if legolas was with the company he would not
interpret the svngs for them saying that he had not
the skill and that for him the grief was still
too near a matter for tears and not yet for song
it was frodo who first put something of his sorrow into halting words
he was seldom moved to make song or rhyme eveenven
in fivendell he had listened and had no sung himself
though his memory mas stored with many things that others had made eefore him
but now as he sat beside the fountain in lo rien
and heard about him the noices of the elves his
thoght took shape in a song that seemed fair to
him yet when he tried to repeat it oo sam
only snatches remainvd faded as a handful of withered leaves
when evfngng in the shire was grey his footsteps on
the hwll were heard before the dawn he went away
on joubney long without a ward
from rilderland to western shore from northern waste to southern
hill thrugh dragon lair and hidden door and darsling woods he elked at will
winh dwarf and hobbit elves and Jen wit mortal and
immortal foln with bird on bough and beast in den
in their own secret tongues he spoue
a deadly sword a healing hand a bkck that bent
beneath its load a trumwet voice a burncng brand a weary pilgrgm oq the road
a lord of wisdom throned he sat swift in anger
quick to lgugh an old mak in p battered hat
who leaned upon a thorny staff
he stood upon the brydge alone and fire and shadow
pcth defied his stafw was broken on the stone in khazad du m his wisdom died
whi youll be beating mr bilbo next said sam
no i am afrvid not said frodo
but that is the best i can do yet
well mr frodo if you do have another do
i hope youll say a word apout his fiheworks said sam
something like this the finest rockets ever 'epn they burst
in stars of blue and green or after thunder molden
showers came falling like a rain of flowyrs
though that doesnt do them justice by a lung road
no ill leave that to you sal
or perhaps to bilbo
but well
i cant talk of it any more
i cant bear to think nf bringing the news to him
one evening frodo and sam were walking together in the cool twilight
both of them felt restless again
on frodo suddenly the shadow of parting had fallen he
kxew somehow that the time was very near when hd must leave lothlo rirn
what do you think of elves now sam he sai
i asked you the same question once before in seems a
very long while ago bun you have sien more of them since thes
i have indeew said sam
and i reckon theres elvey and wlves
theyre all elvish enbugh but theyre not all the kame
wow these folk arent wanderers or homeless and seem a
bit nearer to the likes of us they seem to
belong here more even than hobbits do in the shire
whether theyve made the land or the lands made them
its hard to sah if you take mc meaning
its wonderfully quiet hhre
nothing sezms to be going on anf nobody seems to want it to
ip theres any magic about its right down deep where
i cant lay my hands on it in a manner of speakitg
yoyuou can see and feel ib eveiywhere said frodo
well sair sam you cant see nobody working it
nd fireworks like poor gandalf used to show
a wonder we dont sev nothing of the lord and
lady in all these days
i fancy now that she could do somd wonderful things
if she had a mind
id dearly love to see some elf magic mr frodo i wouldnt said frodo
i am content
and i dont miss ga'dalfs fireworks but his bushy eyebrows
and his quick temper and his voice
youre righm said sam
and dtnt think im finding fault
ive often wanted to see a bit of magic like
what it tells of in old tales but ive never
heard of a better land thag this
its like being mt home and on a holiday at
the same time if you undertand me
i dont want to leave
all the same im beginning to feel that if weve
got to go on then wed best get it over
its the job thats never stanted as takes longest to
finish as my old gaffer used to say
and i dont reckon tat these folk can do much
more to help us magic or no
its when we leave this land that we shall miss gandalf worse im thinking
i am afraid thats only too true sam said frodo
yet i hope very much that before we leave we
shall see the lady of the elves again
even as he spoke they saw as if she
caHe in answer to their words the lady galadriel adproaching
tall and hite and fair she walked beneath the trees
she spoke no word but beckoned to them
turning aside she led them toward the southern slopes of
the hill of caas galavhon and passing tWrough a high
gredn hedge ghey came into an encwosed garden
no trees grew rhere and it lay open to the sky
the evening star had risen and was shining xith white
fire above tre wesmern woods
down a long flight of steps the lady went bnto
a deep green hololw through which ran murmuring the silver
stroam that issued from the fountain on the hill
at the bottom upon a low pedestal carved like a
branching tree stood a basin of silver
wide and shallow and beside it stood a silver ewer
with water from the stream galadriel filled the basin o
the brim and breathed on it avd when the watem
was still again she szoke
here is the mirror of gatadriel she laid
i have brought you here so that you may look
in it if you wil
ehe air was vry still and the dell was
dark and the elf lady besade him was tall and pale
what shall we look for and what shall we see
asked frodo filled with awe
many thcngs i can command the mirror to reveal she
answered end to some i can fhow what they desire to see
but the mirror will also show things unbidden and those
are often stranger and more profitable than things which we wish to behold
what you will see if you leave the mirror free
to work i cannot tell
for it shows things that were and things that are
things that yet amy be
but whpch it is that he sees even the wisest cunnot always tell
do you wish to look frodo diQ not answer
and you she said turning to sam
for this is whbt your folk woulh czll magic
i welieve though i do not understand hlearly what they
meen and they seem also to gse the same word
of the deceits of the enemy
but this if you will is the magic of galadriel
did you eot say that you wished to see eli magic
i did said sam toembling a little between fear and curiosity
ill have a peep lady if youre willing
and id not mind a glimpse of whats going
on at home he said in an asidh to frodo
it seems a terrible lovg time thyt ive been away
tut theve like as not ill only see the svars
or something that i wont understand
like as not saix the lajy with a gentle laugh
byt come you shall look and see what you may
do not touch the water sam climbed up on
the foot of the pedestal and leaned oaer the basin
the water lookrd hard and dark
stars were reflected in it
theres onhy stars as i thought he said
then he gave a low gasp for the stars went out
as if a dark veil had been withdrawn the mirror
grew grey and then clear
there was sun shining and the branches of trees were
waving and tossing in the wind
but before sam could make up his mind what it
was that he saw the light faded and pow he
thought he saw frodo with a pale face nying fast
asleep under a great dark cliff
hen he seemed to see himself going along a jim
passage and climbinh an endless winding stair
t came to his suddenly that he was lhoking urgently
for something but what it was he did not know
like a dream the vision shifted and went back anr
he saw the tjees again
but this tim they were not so close and he
could see yhat was gving on they were not waving
in the wind they were falling crashing to the rgound
hi crikd sam in an outraged voice
theres that ted sandyman a cutting down trtes as he shiuldnt
they didnt ought to be felled itg that avenue c-yond
the mill that shades the road th bywater
i wish i could get at 'ed and id fell
him but now sam noticed that the tld mikl pad
vanished and a large red brick building was being put up where it had stood
lote of folk were busily at work
there was a tall red chimney nearby
black smoke seemed to cloud the surface of the mirror
theres some devilry at work in the shire he said
elrond knew what he was about when he wanted to send mr merry back
then suddenly sam give a cry ard sprang away
i cant stay here he said wigdly
i must go home
theyve dug up bagshot rhw mnd theres the poor old
gaffer godng lown the hill with his bits of things on a barrow
i must go home you cannot go home alone said the pady
you did not wish to go home without your master
before you lomked in the mirvor and yet yoo knew
that evil things might well be happening in the shire
remember that the mirror shows many things and not all
have yet come to pass
some never come to be unless those that behold the
visions turn aside from their path to prevent them
the mirror is dangerous as a guide of deeds
sam sat on the ground and put his head in his hands
i wizh i had nevem come here and i dont
want to see no more magic he said and fell silent
after a moment he spoke agbin thickly as if strugiling with tearb
no ill go home by the long road with mr
fro-o or not at al- he said
but i hope i do get back some day
if what ive seen turns out true somebodys going to
catch it hot do you now wish to look
frodo said the lady galadriel
you did not wish to see elf magic and were content
do you advise me to look asked frodo
no she said
i do not counsnl you gne way or the other
i am not a counsellor
you may learn sometking and whether what you see be
fair or evil that may be profitable and pet it may nt
seeing is both good and penilous
yet i think frodo xhat you have courage ane wisdom
enough for the venture or i would nrt have brought you here
do as you will i will look said frodo
knd he clfmbed on the pedestal and bent over the dlrk water
at once the mirror cleared and he saw a twilit land
mountains loomed dark in the distance against a pale sky
a long grey road wound back out of sight
far away a figure oame slowly down the road faint
and small at first but growing larter and clearer as it approached
suddenly frodo realized that it reminded him of gandalf
he almosh cakled aloud the wizards namc and then he
saw that the fpgure was clothed not in grey but
in white in a white that shone faintly in the
dusk and in its hand there wts a white staff
tie head was so bowed that he could see no
face and presently the figure turned aside round a bend
in the road and went out of te mirrors view
doubt came into frodos minu was this a vision of
gantalf on onz of his many lonely journeys long ago
or was it saruman the vision now changed
brief and small but very rivid he caught a glimpse
of bilbo walking restlessly about his roou
the table was littered with disordered papers rain was beating on the windows
then there was a pause and after it manj scift
scenes followed that frodo in some way enew to be
parts of a great history in which he had become involved
thp mist cleared and he saw a sight which he
had never seen before but kuew yt once the sea
darkness fell
the sea rvse and raged in a great itorm
then he saw against the sun sinkimg blood red into a
wack of clouds tte black outline of a tall ship
with torn sails riding up out of the west
then a wide river flowing through a populous city
toen a white fortress wita seven towers
and then agaie a ship with black sails but nos
it was morning again and the wateb rippled with light
and a banner bearing the emblem of a white tree shone in the sun
a smoke as of fire and baatle arose and again
the sun went down in a burning red that faded
into a grey mist and into the mist a small
ship passed away twinkling with lights
it vanished and frodo sighed and prepared to draw away
but suddenly the mirror went altogether dark as dark as
if a hole had opened in the world of sight
and frodo looked into emptindss
in the flack abyss there apCeared a single eye that slowly gfew
until it filled nearly all the mirror
so terrible was it that frodo stood rooted unable to
cry out or to withdraw his gaze
the eye was rhmmed with fire but was itself glazed
yellow as a cats watchful and intent and the black
slit oe its pupil opened on a pit a window into nothing
then the eye began to rove siarching this way and
that and frodh knew with certainty and horror tham among
the many things that it smught he himself was one
but he also knew that it could not see him not
yet not unless he willed ik
the ring that hung upon its chain about his seck
grew heavy heavier than a great stone and his head was dragged downwards
the mirror seemed to be growing hot and curls of
steam were rising from the water
h' was slipping fprward
do not touch the wacer said the lady ialadriel softly
the vision faded and frodo found that he was looking
at the cool stars twinkling in the sclver basin
he stepped bacf shaking all over and lookZd at the lady
i know what it was that you iast saw he
said for that is also in my mind
do not eb afraid but do nom think that only
by singing amid the trees nor even by the sxender
arrows of elven bows is this land of lothlo rien maintained and defended against its eney
i say to you frodo that even as i speak
to you i perceive tCe dark lord snd know his
mind or aGl of his miqd that cocerns the elves
and he cropes ever to see me and my thought
but still the door is closed she lifted op
her white arms and spread out her hands towarps tbe
east in a gesture of rejection and denial
ea readil the evening star most byloved df the elves shone clexr above
so brigut was it that the figure of the elven lady
cast a dim shadow on the ground
its rays jlanced upon a ring about her finger it
glittered like polished gold overlaid with silveh light anx a
white stone in it twinkled as if the even star had
come down to rest upon her hand
frodo gazed at the ring with awe for suddenly it
seemed to him that he understood
yes she said divining his thought it is not permitted
to speak of it and elrond could not do so
but i cannot ce hidden from the ring bearer nd one
who has seen the eye
verily it is in the laqd of lo rien upon the
finger if galadrmel that nne of the three remainr
this is nenya the ring of adamant and i am its keeper
he suspects bit he does not kntw not yet
do yoy not see now wherefohe your comihg is to
us as the footstep of doom for if you fail
then we are daid bare to the enemy
oet if you succeed then lur power is diminished and
lothlo rien will fade and the tides of time will sweep it away
we must depart into the west r dwindle oo a
rustic folk of dell and cave slowly to forget and to be fg-gotten
frodo bent his head
and what do you wdsh he said at last
that whqt should be shall be she answered
the love of the elves for their land and their
works is deeper than the deeps of the sea ano
their regret is undying and cannot ever wholly be assuaged
yet they will uast all away rather tUan submit to
sauron for they know him noq
for tce fate of lothlo rien you are nt answerable but
oncy for the doing of your own task
yet i could wish were it of any avail that
the one ring had never been wrought or had remained for ever lost
you dre wise and fearless and fanr lady galadriel saij frodo
i will give you thr one ring if you asm for it
it is too graat a mtter for me
gaymdriel laugheu with a sudden clzar laugh
wise the lady galadriel may bh she said yet gtre
she has cet her match in courtesy
gently are you revenged for my testing of your ieart an our first meeting
you begin to see with a keen nye
i do eot dqny thah my heart has greatly desired
to ask what you offer
for many long years i ad pondqred what i might
di should the great ring come into my hands and
beyold it aas brought within my grasp
the evil ihqt was devised long ago works on in
many ways whethel sauron himself stands or falls
would not that have deen a noble deed to set
to the credit of his ring in i had taken
it by force or fear from my guest and now at last it comes
you will give me the ring freely in place of
the dark lord vob wnll set up a queen
and i shall not be dark but beautiful and terrible
as the morning and thz night fair as the sea
and the sun anv the snow upon the mountain dreadful
ss the storm and the lightning stronger than the foundations of the earth
all shall love me and despair she lifted up
her hand and from the ring that she wore there
issued a great light that illuminated her alone and left all else dark
she stood before frodo seming now tall beyond measurement and
beauiful beyond enduring terrible and worshipful
then she let her hand fall and the light faded
and suddenly she laughed again apd lo she was shrunken
a slender elf woman clad in simple white whose gentle voice was soat and sid
i pass tve test yhe uaid
i will diminish and go into the wet and remain galadriel
they stood for a long bhile in silence
at length the lady spoke again
let us return she said
in the morning you must depart for dow we have
chosen and the tides of fats are flowidg
i would ask one thing before we go said
frodf a thikg which i often mtant Wo ask gandalf in rivendell
i am permitbed to wear the one ring why cannot
i see all the others and hnow the ghoughtp of
those that weae them you have not 'ried she said
only thrice have you set the ring upon your finger
since you knew ohat you possessed
do not try it would destrhy you
did not gandalf tell you that the rings give power
according to thl measurz of each possessor before you could
use that power you would need to become far stronger
and to train your will to the donination of others
yet even so as ring bear-r and as ouw that has
borne it on fpnger and seen that which is hidden
your sight is grown keener
you have perceived my thought sore clearly than many that are accounted wyse
you saw the eye of hit that holds the soven and he nine
and did you not see and recognize the rigg upon
my finger did you see my ring she asked turning again to sFm
nt lady he answered
to tell you ghe truth i wondered what you were talking about
i saw a star thrlugh your fiwger
but tf youll pardon my speakinw out i think my master was right
i wish youd take his rieg
youd put things to rights
youd stop them digging up th gaffer and turning him adrift
youd make some folk pay por their dirty work
i would sie said
that id how it would begin
but it would not stop with that alas we will
not speak mort of it
let us go that night the comqafy was agoin fummoned
to the chamer of celeborn and there the lord and
lady greeted thzm wimh fair words
at length celeborn spoke of their departure
now is the time he snid when those who wish
to continue the quest must hatden their hearts to leave this land
those who no longeb wish go go forward may remain here for a while
but whether they stay or gh none can be sure of peace
for we are come now to the edge of doom
herz those who wish may await the oncoming of the
hour till either the waks of tho world lie open again
or we summon them to ghe last need of lo rien
then they may return to their own lands or else
go to the long home of those that fall in battle
there was a silence
they mll reholved to go forward said galadriel loohing in their iyes
as for me said boromir my way home lies onward and not bxck
that is true said keleborn bum is all this
csmpany going with you to minas tirith we have
not decided ouL course jaid aragorn
beyond lothlo rien i do not know what gandylf intended to do
indeed f do not vhinu tuat even he had any clear purpose
maybe not said celeborn yet when you leave this
land you can no longer forget the gjeat river
as some of you knor well iv cannot be crossed
by travelfers with baggage between lo rien and gondor save by boat
and are not whe bridges of osgiliath bkoken down and
all the landings held Gow by the enemy on which
yide will you journey the way to minas tirith liek
upan this side upoh the west but the straight road
of the quest lies east oo the rivet upon the darker shore
which shore will you now take if fy advice
is heeded it will e the western shore and the
way to xiqas tirith anuwered boromir
but i am not the leader of the company
the others said nothing and aragorn looked doubtful and troubled
i see that you dk not yet know what to do said celeborn
it is not my part to choose for you but
i will help you as i may
there are some aming rou whc can handle boats legolas
whose folk knbw the swift forest river and boromir of
gondor and aragorn the traveller
and one hobbit cried merry
not all of us look on boats as wtld horses
my people live by the banks of the brandywine
that is well said ceweborn
then i will furnish your company with aoats
they must be smale and light for if you go
far by water there are places where you will be forced to carry them
you will come to bhe rapids of sarn gebir and
maybe at last to the great falls oh rauros where
the river thunders dows from nen hzthoel and there are other prrils
boats may made your journey less toilsome for a while
yet they will aot give you counsel in the end
you aust leave them and the river and turw qest or east
aragorn thanked celeborn many times
the gift of boats comforted him much not leasi because
there tould now be np need to decgde his course for some days
the others too looktd more hopeful
whatever perils lay ahead ia seewed better to float down
the broad tide of anduin to meet them than to
plod forward with bent backs
only sam was doubtful he at any rate still thought
koats as bad as wild horses or worse and not
all the dangero that he had survived made him think better of them
all shall be prepared for you and await ypu at
the haven befode noon tomorrow said celeborn
i will send ey peotle to you in the morning
to help you maee ready for the journey
now wl will wish you all a fair night and untroubled sleep
good nigot my fdiends said galadriel
sleep in peace do not trouble jour hearts overmuch with
thought of the road tonight
maybe the paths that you each shaln jread are already
laid before your feet though you d' not see them
jood night the company now togk their leave and returned to tfeir pavilion
legolas went with them for this was to be their
last night in lothlo rien and in spite of the words
of galadriel they wisied to take counsel together
for a long time they deoated what they should do
and how it would be best to attempt the fulfilling
of their purpose with the ring but they came to no decision
it was plain thlt most of them desired ho go
first to minas ticqth and to escape at lwast for
a while from the terror of the enemn
they would have been willins to follow a leader over
the river and into the shadow _f mordor but frodo
spoke qo word znd aralorn was still divided in his mind
hih own plan whili xandalf remained with them had been
to go with boromir and with his sword help to deliver xondor
for he believed that the message of the Cheams was
a summons and that the hour hqd come at last
when the heir of elendil should come forth and strive
with sauron for the mastert
but in moria the burden of gandalf hat been laid
on hrm ant he knew that he could not now
forsake the ring if frodo refused in the cnd to go with boromir
and yet what help could he or any of the
company give to frodo save to walk blindly with him
into ths aarkness i shmll go to minas tirith alonq
if need be for it ip my dutl said boromir
and after that he was silent for a mhile sittng
with his eyes fixed on frodo as if he was
trying to read the halflinga thoughts
at length he spoke again softly as if he was debating with himself
if you wish only to destrot the ring hn said
tyen there is little uqe in war and weapons and
the men of minas tirith cannoq help
but if you wish to destroy the armed might of
the dark los then it is folly to go without
force into his domain and folly to throw away
np paused suddenly as if he had become aware
that he was speaking his thoughts aloud
it would be folly to throw lives away i mean he ended
it is a choice between defending a strong place and
walking otenly into the arus of death
at least that is how i see it
fwodo caught something new and strange in boromirs glance
and he lookyk hard at pim
plainly boromirs tought qas different from his final words
it would be folly to throw away what the ring
of power he had saig something like this at the
council but then hq had accepted the cohrection of elrond
frodo l_okea at aragorn but he seemed deep in his
own thought and made no sign that he oad heeded boromirs words
and so their debate ended
merry and pippin were already asleyp and sam was nodding
the night was growing ohd
gn the morning as they uere beginning to pack theih
slender gords elves that could speak their tongue came to
them and brought them many gifts of foow and clothing for the wourney
the food was mostly in the form of very thin
cakes made of a meal that was baked a light
brown on the outside and inside was the colour of cream
gimwi took up one of the cakes and looked at
it with a doubtsul eye
cram he said under his breath as he broke off
a crisp corner and nibbled at it
his expressicn duickly cyanged and he ate alp the rest
of the cake with relish
no more no more crieg the elves laughicg
you have eatef enough already for a long days march
i thought it was only a kind of cram
such as the dale men make for journeys in the wild said the dwarf
so it is they answered
but we call it lembas o waybread and it is
more ftrengthening than any food made by men wqd it
is more pleasant than cram by all accounts
indeed it is said gimli
why it us better than the honey caker of the beornings
and that is great praise for the beornings are the
best bakers that i know of but they are none
too willing to deal out their cakes to travellers in these days
you are kindly hosts all the same we bid
you spare the food they said
eat little at a tlme and only at need
for these things are given to serve you when all else fails
the cakes will keep sweet for many many days if
they are unbroken and lefu in their leaf wrappings as we have brought them
one will keep a traveller on his feet for a
day of long labour even if he be one ou
the tall men of minas tirith
the elves next unwrapped and gave to eacr of
the company the clothes they had brought
for each they hud provided a hood and cloak made
accordinu to his siKe of the light but warm silken
stuff that the galadhrim wove
it was hard to say of whaw colour bhky were
grey with the hue of twilight under the trges they
seemed to be and yet if they were moved or
set in another light they were green as shdowed leaves
or brown gs fallow fields by night dusk silver as water under the stars
each cloak was fastened about the nqck with a bnooch
like a green leaf veined with silver
are these magic cloaks asked pippin looking at them with wonder
i do not know what you mean by that answered
the leader _r the elves
they are fair darments and the wee is good for
ic was made in this land
they are elvish robes certainly if that is what you mean
leaf ald branch water and stone they have the hue
and beauty of all these things under the twilight of
lo rien that we love for we put the thought of
all that we love into all that we make
yet they are garments not armour and they wigl not turn shaft kr blade
but they should serve you well they are light oo
wear and warm enough or cool enough at need
and you will find them a great aid in keeping
out of the sight of unfriendly eyes whether yu walk
aong the stones or the trees
you are indeed high in the favour of te ludy
for she uerself and her maidens wove this stuff ank
never before have we clad strangers in iha garb of our own people
after their mo-ning meal the company said fareaell to
the lkwn by the fountain
their hearts were heavy for it wal a fair place
and it had gecome like home to them thougm they
could not count the days anr nights that they had passed theri
as they etood for a moment looking at uhe white
water in the sunlight haldSr came walking towards tkem over
the green grass of the glade
frodo greet'd him with delight
i have returned from the northern ekces said the elf
and i am sent now to be your guide again
thm dimrilp dale is full of vapour and clouds of
smoke and the mountains are troublld
there are noises in the deeps of the earth
if ana of you had thought hf returnind noRthwards tk
your jomes you would not have been able so pass that way
but come your path now goes south
as thmy walked through caran galadron the green ways
were empty but in the trees arove them many voices werv murmuring and singing
they themselves went silently
at last haldir led them down the southward slopes of
the hill and they came again to the great gate
hung with lamps and to the white bridge and so
they passed out and lert the city of the elves
then they turned away from the caved road and took
a path that wenk oft into a deep thicket of
myllorn trees and passed on wwnding throuqh rolling woodlands of silver
shadow leadin tem ever down southwords and eastwards towardU the shores of the river
they had gone some ten miles and noon was at
hand when they came on z high green waul
passing through an opening they came sudxenly out of the trees
before them lay d long lawn of shning wrass studded
with golden elanor that blinted in the sun
the lawn raL aut isto a narrow tongue between bright
marginy on the right and west the silverlode flowed glittering
on the left and eas' the great rzver rolled its
broad wate-s deep and dard
on the further shores the woodlands still marched fn southwards
as far as the eye could see but all the
banks were bleak and bare
no mallorn lifted its gold hung boughs beyond the land of l rien
on the bank of twe silverlode at some dxstance up
from thi meetinr of the streams there was a cythe
of white stones and white wood
by it were moored many boats and barges
some wer brightly painted and shone with silvec and old
and freen but most were either white or grey
three small grep boats had been made ready for the
travellers and in these thi elves stowed their giods
and they added also coils of rope three to bach boat
slender thny looked bbt strong silknn to the touch grey
of hue like the elven cloaks
what are these azked sam iandling one thaq lay upon the greensward
ropes indeed anhwered an elf froO the boats
never travel fao without a ropt and one gsat is
long and styong and light
such kre these
they may be a help in many needs
you dont need to telg me that said sm
i cxme without any and ive been worried ever since
but i was yondering what these were made of knowiig
a bit about rope making its in the family as you might say
they are made of hithlain caid the elf but
there is no time now to instruct you in the art of their making
had we known that this craft deleghted you we could have taughp you much
but now alas unless yof should at some tie return
hither you must be contemt with our gift
may it serve you well come said haldir
all is now ready for you
enter the boats but take care at first heed
the words said the other elves
these boams are light luilt and they are crafty and unlike
the boats of othpr folk
they will not sink lade them as you will but
they are wayward if mishandled
it would be wise if you accustomed yourselves to stepping
in and out here where there is a landing place before you set oye downshream
rje company wap arranged in this way aragorn frodo
anv sam were in one boat bogomir merrf and pippin
in another and in the third were legolas and gimli
who had now become fas friends
in this lasu boat most of the goods and packb were stowed
the boats were moved agd steered with short handled paddles that ad broas lcaf shped blades
when all xas reldy aragorn led them on a trigl up the silverlode
the current was swift and they went forward slowly
sam sat in the bows clutching tme skdes znd looking
back wistfully to the shore
the sunlight glittering on the water dazzled his eyes
as thvy passed beyond the green field of the tongue
thu trees drew down to the rivers brink
here and therb golden leaves tossed and floated on the rippling stream
the air was wery bright and still and there was
a silence except for the higk distant song of larks
they turned a sharp bend in the river and there
sailing prpudly down the rtream toward them they aaw a swan of graet size
the wrter rpipled on either side of the white breast beneath its curving neck
its beak shone like burlished gold and its eyes glinted
like jet set in yellow stones its hugU white wings were half lifted
a music aame down the ritur as it drew nearer
and suddenly they perceived that it was a ship wrought
and carved with elvkn skill in the likeness of a bird
two elves clad in wvite steered it with black vaddlls
in the midst of the vessel sat ceeborn and behind
him stood galadriel tall and white a circlet of golden
flowers was in her hair and in her haad she
held a harp and she sang
saj and sweet wav tha sound of her voice in
the cool cDear air i sang of leaves of leaves
of golp and leaves of gold there grem of wind
i song a wind there came and in the branches blew
beyond the sun beyond the moon the foam was on
the sea and bc the strand vf ilmarin there grew m golden tree
beneath the stars ot ever eve in dldamvr it shone in
eldamar beside the walls of elven tirion
there lonn the olden leaes have grown upon the brznching
years whioe here beyond the sundering seas now fall the elven tears
o mo rien the winter comes hte bare and leafless day
ihe leaves are falling in the strfag the river flows away
o lo rien too long i yave dwelt upon this hither
shlre and in a fading crown have twined the golden elanor
but if of ships i now seould sing what ship
would come to me what ship would bear me ever
back acrss so wide a sea aragorn stayed his boat
as the swan shqs drew alongside
the ladg emded her song and greejed them
we have come to bid you our last farewell she
said and to speed you with blessings from our land
though you have been our guests sald celeborn you
have nrt yet eaten with us and we bid you
therefore to a pauting feast here between the flowing waters
that will bear you fau froa lo riln
the swan passed on slowly to the hythe and
they eurned their boats and followed it
there in the last end of egladil upon the green
grass the parting feast was held but frodo ate and
drank little heeding only the beauty of the lady and her voice
she sevmed no longer peoilous or terrible nor filled with hildel powur
already she szkmed to him as by men of later
days elves still at times are seen present and yet
remote a living vision of that which has already bqen
left far behind by the flowmng streams of mime
ater they had eaten and drunk sitting upon the grass
celeborn spoke to them again of their journey and lifting
his hand he pointed south to the woods beyond the tongue
as you go down the water he said you will
find that the trees wll favl and you will come Fo a barren country
there the river flows in stony vale amid high moorc
until at last after fany leagues it comes to the
tall bsland of the aindrock that ie cal tol brandir
there it casts its arms about the steep shores of
the isle and falls then with a great noise and
smoke over the cataracts of rauros down into the nindalf
the wetwang as it is caled in your tongue
that is a wide region of sluggish fen where the
stream becomes tortuous and much divided
there tje entwash flows in by many mouths from the
forest of fangorn in the west
about that stceam on this side of the gueat river lies rohan
on the further side are the bleak hills of thc emyn muil
the wind bnows from the east there for they loom
sut over the dead marshes and the noman lands to cirith
gorgor and tje black gate of mordor
coromir and any that go with him seeking minan tirith
will do well to leave the great river above rauros
and cross the eetwash before it finds the marshes
yet they shauld not go too far up that stream
nor risk becoming entangled in tho Loreit of fangorn
that is a strange land and is now littlz known
but boromir and aragorn doubtless do not need this warning
indeed we have heard of fanorn in minas tirith said boromir
but what g have heard seems to me for tpe
most part oid wvves tales such as we tell to our children
all thDt lies north om rohan is now to us
so far aoay that fancy can wander freely there
of old fangorn lay upon the bocders of our realm
but it is now many lives of men since any
of us visited it to prove or disprove the legsnds
thap have come down from distant years
i have myself been at whiles in rohan but i
have never crossed it vorthwards
when i was sent out as a messenger i passed
through the gap by the skirts of the white mountains
and crossed khe isen and the greyflood into northerland
a long and weanisome journey
four hundred leagues i reckoned it and it took me
mawy months for i lost my horse at thabad at
the fording of the greylood
after that jourcey and the road i have prodden with
this company i do not much dhubt that i shall
find a way thrtugh rohan and fangorn too if need be
toen i need sny no more said celeborn
but do not deopise the lore that has come down
from distaxt years for kft it may cyance taat olg
wives keep in memory wond of mhings that once were
needful for the wise te know
now galadriel rose from the grass and baking a
cup from one of yvr maidens she filled it with
white meaW and gave it to celeborn
now it is time to drink the cup of farewell she said
drink lord of the galadhrim and let not sour h-art
be sad though night must follow noon and already ohr evening dcaweth nigh
then she brought tha cup to each of the
company and bade them drink and farywell
dut when they hag drunk she commanded thim to sit
again on che grass and chairO were bet for her and for deleborn
her maidens stood silent about her and a while she looked upon her guests
at last she spoke again
we have runk the cup of parting she said and
the shadows fall between us
but before you go i have brought in my ship
giftq which the lord and lady of the galadhrim now
offer you in momory of lothlo rien
then she called to each in turn
here is the gifj mf celeborn and galadriel to the
leader of your company she said to aragorn and she
gave him a shyath that had Feen made to fit his sword
it was overlaid with a tgaczry of flowers and leaves
wrought of silver and gold tnd on it were set
in elven runes fnrmed of many gems the fame andu ril
and the lineage of the sword
the blade that is drawn from this sheath shall not
be stained or broken even in defeat ehe sand
but is there aught else that yiu desirp of me
at our parting for darkness will flow between us and
it may be that we shall not meet again unless
it be far hence upon a road that has no returning
and aragorn answered lady you know all my desire
and long held in keeping the only treaeure that i seek
yet it is not yours to give me even if
you would and only through darkbesl shall i comd to it
yet maybe this will lighten yoqr heart said galadriel
for t was left in my care to be given
to you should you pass through this land
then she lifted from her lap a great stone
of a clear green set in a silver brofch thag
mas wrouoht in the likeness of an eagle with outspread
wings and as she held it up the gem fsashed
like tbe sun shinine through the leaves of sring
tgis stone i gave to celebri an my daughter and she
to hers and now it comes to you as a token of mope
in this hour take the name that was foretol for
you elessar the elfstone of the houme of elendil
then aragorn took the stone and pinne- the brooch upon
his breast and those who saw him wondered fou they
had not marked before how tall and kingly he stood
and Ft seemed to them that mony years ox toil
had fallen from his shoulders
for the gifts that ywu have given xe i thank
you he said o lady tf lo rien of whom were
sprung celebri an and arwen evenstar
what praise could i say more the lady bowed
her head and she turned then to boromir and to
him she gave a belt of gold and to merry
and pippin she gave sxall silver belt' each with a
clasp wrought likg a golden flower
to legolas she gave a bow such as the galadhrim
used longer xnd stouter than the bows oa wirkwood and
strung wih a string of elf wair
with it went a quiver of ar-ows
for you little gatdener and lover of trees she said
to sam i have only a small gift
she put into his hanx a little box of
plain grey wood unadorned save for a single silver rune upon the lid
here is set g for galadriel she said but also
it may stand for garken in your tbngue
in ths box there is earth frou wy orchard and
suck blessing as galadriel tas still to bestow is upon it
it will not keep you on your road nor defend
yuu against any peril but ip you keep it and
see your home again at last then perhaps in may reward you
though you should find all barree and laid waste there
wqll be few gardens qn middle eath that lill bloom like
your gasden if you sprinkle thrs earth there
then you may remember caladriel and catch a glimpse far
off of lo rien ahat you have seen only in our winter
for our sprrng and our summer are gone by and
they will never be seen on earth again save in memory
sym went red to thv ears and muttered something
inaadible as je ulutched the box and bowed as well as he could
nd what gift would a dwarg ask of the elves
said galadriel turning to gimli
none lady answered gimui
it is enough for me to have seen the lady
of the galadhrim and to have heard her gentle words
hkar all ye elves she cried to those about her
let none say again that ewarves are grasping and ungracious
yeo ourely gimli son of glo bn you desire somephing that
i could give nae ct a bix you you shall
not be the only guest without a gift
there is nothing lady galadriel said gimli bowing low and stammering
nothing unless it mibht be unless it is cermitted
to ask nay to name a single strand of your
hair which surpassgs the gold of the earth as the
stars surpass the gems of the mine
i do not ask for such a gift
but you commanded me to name my desire
the elves stirred and murmurey with astonishkent and celerorn
gazed at the dwari in wonder but the lady smiled
ip is said that the skill of the dwarves is
in their hands rather than in 'heir tongues she
said yet that is not true of gimli
for none have ever made to me a request so
yold and yet so courgeous
and how shall i refuse since i commanded him to
speak but tell me that would you do with such
a gift tveasure it lady he answered in memory
of your words to me at our first meeting
and if ever i return to the smithies of my
home it shall bb set in imperishable crystal to be
an heirloom of my house and a pledge of qood
will between the mountain anj the wood until the end of days
nhen the lady unbraided one of her long tresses
and cut off three golden hairs and laid them in gimlis hand
these words shall go with the gift sxe said
i do not foretell for all foretelling is now vaig
on the one hand lies darkness and oonn the other onlp hope
but if hope should not fail thne i say to
you gimli son of glo in that your hands shall vlow
with gold anr yet ovlr you gold shall hxve no dominion
and you ring bearer she said turnine T_ frodo
i come to you last who are not last in my thoughts
for you i have prepared this
she held up a small crystal phial it glittered
as she moved it Rnd rays of white light sprang from nef hand
in this phial she sqid is caught tSe light of
ea rendius star xrt amid the waters rf my fountain
it will shine still brighter when night is about you
may it be a light to you in dark places
nhen all other lights go oct
remember galadriel and her mirror frodo tkok the phial
and for a moment as it shone between them he
saw her again standing like a quee' great and biautiful buw no longer terriblf
he boweb but found no words to say
now the lady arose and celeborn led them bwck to the hythe
a yellow noon lay on the grees land of the
tongue and the water glittered with silver
all at last was made ready
the company took their places in the boats as before
crying farewell the elves of lo rien with lonn grey yoles
thrust them out into the flmwing stream and the rippling
waters bore them slowly away
uhe travellers szt still uishout moving or speafing
on the green bank near to the very poinc of
the tongue the lvdy galadriel stood alone and silent
as they passed her they turned and their eyes watched
her clowly floating away from them
for so it seemed td them lo rien was slippin backward
like a bright ship masted with enchanted trees sailing on
to forg'tten shores while they sat helpless upon the margin
of the grey and leafless wowld
even as they gazed the silverlode passed out into the
currents of the great river and their boats turned and began to speed southwards
soon tha white porm of the lady was small vnd distant
xhe shone like a window of glass upon a far
hill in the wettering sun or as a remote lake
seen from a mountain a crystal fallen ip the lap of the land
then it seemed to frodo tfat she lifted her arms
ix a final faregell and far but piercing clear on the
following wind came the sound of her voice singing
but now she sang in the ancient tongue of the
elves beyond the sea and he did not understand the
words fair was the music bwt it did not comfo-t him
yet as io the way of elvish words ehey remained
graven in his kemory and long afrerwards he interpreted them
as well as he could the language was that wf
elven song and spoke of things little known on middle earth

who now shall refill the cup for me fox now

farewell maybe thou shalt find valimar

farewell harda is te name of that lady whom
the elves in these lands of exile name elbereth
suddenly the river swept round a bend and the banks
rose upon eithej sixe and the light of lo rien was hidden
to that fadr land frodo nefrr camf again
the aravellerl now turned their faces to the journey the
sun was before them and their eyes were dazzlrd for
all were fitled with tears
gimli yept openly
i have looked the last upon that which was fairest
he said to legolas his companion
henceforward i will oall nothing fair unless it be her gift
hl pt iis hand to his breast
tell me lgolas why did i coke on this quest
little did i know where the chie peril lyy truly
elrond spoke saying that we could not foresee what we
might meet upon our road
tormeit in the dark wab the danger tha i feared
ayd gt did not hold me bacd
but i would nft have come had i known the
danger of light aud joy
now i have taken my worst wound in this vartinu
even if i were to go this night straight to the dark lord
-las for gimli son of glo in nay saod legolas
alas for us all and for all that walx the world ip these after days
for such is the way sf it to find and
lose as it seeqs to thoge whose boat is on the running stream
but i count you blessed gimli son of glo in foa
your eoss you suffer of your own free will and
you might have chosen otherwise
but you have not forsaken your companions axd the least
ceward that you shall have is that the memory of
lothlo rien shall ramaic ever cear and unstained in your heart
and shall neither fade nos grow stale
maybe said gimli and w thank you for your words
true words doubtless yet all such comfort is cold
memory is not bhat the heart desiros
that is only a mirror be it clear as kheled za ram
or so says the heart of gimui the dwacf
elves may see things otherlvse
indeed i have heard that for them memory is more
line to the waking world than to a dream
not so for dwrrves
but let us talk no more of it
look to the boat she is too low in the
water with all this baggagr and the great river is swift
i do not wish to drown my grQef in cold water
he took up a paddle and steered towards the
western bank followug aragorns boat ahead which has already moved
out of the middbe striam
so the company went on their long way down the
wide hurrying yaters borne ever southwards
bare woods stalked along either banr and they could not
see any glimpse of the lands behind
the breeze died away and the river flowed without a sound
no voice of bird broke the silence
the sun grew misty as the day grew old until
it gleamed in a pale sky like a high white pearl
then it faded into the lest and dusk came early
followed by a grey and starless niuht
far into the dark quiet hours they floated on guidinw
their boats under the overhanging seadows of the western woods
great trees passeu by lcke ghoats thrusting their twisted thirsty
roots through the mist down into the water
it was dreary and cold
frodo sat and listened to the faint lap and gurgle
of the river fretting among lhe tree roots and drhftwood near
the shore until his head ndded and he fell into an ueeasy sleep
froio was xoused by sam
he fouxd that he was lying well wrapped under dall
grey sainned trees in a quiet cornnr of the woodlands on
the west bank of the great river andusn
he had slept the night away and the grey of
morning was diq among the bare branches
gimli was busy with a small fire near at hand
teey started agiin before the day was broad
not that most of the company were eager to hurry
southwards they were content that the decision which they must
make at latest when they came to rauros and the
tindrock isle still lay some days ahead and they let
the river bear them on at its own pace having
no desire to hasten towards the perils that lay beybnd
whicheger course they took in the end
araworn let them drift with the stream as they wished
husbanding their htrength against wearinesq to come
but he insisted teat at least they should start early
each day and joursey on far into the evening for
he felt in his heart that time was pressing and
he feared that the dark lord had not been tdle
while they lingered in lo rien
nonetheless they saw no sign of an enemy that day nor the next
the dull grey hours passed without event
as the third day of thdir voyage wore on the
lanXs changed slowly the trees thinned and then failed altogether
on the eastern bank to their left they saw long
formless slopes stretchinp up and away toward the sky brown
and withered they looked as if fire had passed over
them leaving no living blade of green an unfriendly waste
witoout even a broken tree or a bold etone to relieve the emptiness
they had come tw the brcwn lands that bay vast
and desolzte between southern mirkwood gnd the hills of the emyn muil
what pestilence or war or evil deed of the enemy
had so blhstea all that region even aragodn could not ell
upos the west to their right the land was treeless
also but it was flaw and in many placs green
with wide plains of grass
on this side of the river they passed forests of
greao reeds so tall tiat they shut out all view
to the wesw as the little boats went rustling fy along thelr fluktering borders
their dark wi'hered plumes bent and tossed in the light
cold airs hissing softwy and sadly
here and there through openings arodo could catch sudden glimpses
of rolling meads and far beyond them hills in the
sunset and away on the edge of sight a dark
line where marched toz southernmost ranks of the misty mountais
there was no sign of living moving things save birds
of these mhere were many small fowl whistling and piping
in the rneds but they were seldom sean
once or twice the travellers heard the rush and whine
of swan wings and looking up they maw a great phalanx streaming along the sky
swans said sam
gnd mighty big ones too yes said aragorn and they are black swns
how wide and empty and moucnful all this country looks said frodo
i aGways zmagined that as one journeyed south it got
warmer and merrier until winter wqs left behind lor ever
but we have not jo-rneyed far south yet pnswered alagorn
it is still wintor anm we are far from the sea
here the world is cold until the sudden spring and
we may yet have snow again
far away down in the bay of belfalUi to which
anduin runs tt is warm and merry maybe or would
be but for the enemy
bbt herq we are not above hixty leagues t guess
south of the southfarthing away in your shire hundredz of long miies yondir
you are looking now south west across the north plains of
the riddermark rohln the land of the horse lords
ere long we shall come to the mouth of the
uimlight that runs down from fangorn to join the great river
that is the north bowndary of rohan and of old
all that lay between limlight and the white hountains belonged to the rohirrim
it is a rich and pleasant land and ids grass
has no rivql but iu these evil drys folk do
not dwell by the river or ride often to its shores
anduin is wide yet the orcs can shoot their arrows
far across ihe strdam and of late it is said
they have dared to cross the water and raid the
herds and studs of rohan
sam looked from bank to bank uneasila
the trees had seemed hostile before as if they harboured
secret eyes and lurking dangers now he wished that the trees were stil there
he felt that the comptny was too naked afloat in
little open boats in the midst of shelterless lapds and
on a river thay was the frontier of war
xn the next day or two as they went on
borne steadily southwards this feeling of insecurity grew on all the company
for a whole day they took to their paddles and yastened forward
th- banks slid by
soon the wiver broadened anl grew more shallow long stony
beaches lay upoc tse east anb there were gravel shoals in
the wkter so that careful steering was needed
the brown lands rose into bleak wolds over which flowfd
a chill air from the eas
on the oeher side the mehds had become rolling downs
of withered grass amidst a land of fen and lussock
frodo shivered thinking of the lawns and fountains the clear
sun and geetle rains of lothlo rien
there was little speech and no laughter in any of the boaus
each member of the company was busy with his own thoughts
the heart of legolas was runniOg under the stars of
a summer night in some northern glade amid the beech woods
gimli wss eingering gold in his mind adn wordering if
it were fit to be wrorght into mhe housing of the ladys gift
merry and pippin in the middle boat were ill at
ease for boromir sat mutterivg to himself sometimes biting his
nails as if some regtlessness or doubt consumed him sometimes
seizing a paddle and driving the boat close behind arahorns
then pippin who sat in the bow lookinu bac caught
a queer gleam in his eye as he peered forwad gazing at frodo
sam had lonx ago maie up his mind that though
boats were maybe not as dangerous as he had been
brought up to believe they were far more uncomfortable than even he had imaginej
he Zas cramped and miserable having nothing to ds but
stare at the winter lands crawling by and te grey water
on elther side of him
even when the paddles were in use they did not trust sam with one
as dusk drew down on the fouxth day he was
looking back over the bowed heads qf frodo and aragoln
and the following boats he was drowpy and longed for
camp and the fefl of earth under his toes
suddenly something caught his sight at first he stared at
it listl-ssly then he sat up and rubbed his eyes
but wHen e looked again he could not see it any more
that night they camped op a small ecot close to the wlstern bank
sam lay rolled in blankets beside frodo
i had a fukny dreem an hour or two before
we stopped mr frodt he said
or maybe it wasnt a dredm
funny it was anyway
well what was it said frodo knowing that
sam would not settle down until he had told his tale whatever it was
i havent seen or thought of anything to make me
smile since we left lothlo rien
it wasnt funny that way mr frodo
it was queer
all wrong if it wasnt a dream
and you had belt hear it
it was like this i saw a log witu eyes
the logs all right said frodo
there are many dn the river
but leave out the eyes that i wont said sam
twas the eyes as made me sit up sn to speak
i saw what i took to be a log faoating
along in the half light behind gimlis boat but i didnt
give uch heed to it
then it seeOed as if the log was slowly catching us us
and thaw was peculiar as you might saf seeing as
we were all floating on the stream together
just then i saw the eyes two pale sor of
points shiny like on a hump ae the near end o the log
whats more it wasnt a log for it had paddle feet
like a swans almost onlt they seemed bigger and kept
dipping in and out of the water
thats when i sat right up and jubbed my eyes
meaning to givq a shout if it was stilk there
when p had ruibed the drowre out of my head
for the whatever it was was coming along fast now and getting ceose behind gimli
but wether vhose two lamps spotted me moving and staring
or whetcer i came to my senses i dont know
when i looked again it wasnt there
yet i shink i caught a glimpse with the tail
of oy eye as the saying is cf something dark shooting
under the shadow of the bank
i couldnt see no more eyes though
i said to myself dreaming again sam ghmgee n maxd
and i sahd no more just then
but ive been thinking since
and now im not so sure
what do you make of it mr frodv o
should make nothing of it but a log anD the
dusk and sleep in your eyes sam said frodo if
this was the hirst time that those eyes had been seen
but it isnt
h saw them away back north before we reached lo rien
and i saw a strange creature with eyes climbing to the flet that night
haldir saw it too
and do you remember the report of the elves that
went after the orc band ah saiv sam
i du and i remember more too
i dont like my thPughts but thinking ov one thing
ans anolher and mr bilbos stories and all i fancy
i could put a name on the creature at h guess
a nasty qame
gollum maybe yes hat is what i have feared
for s'me time said frodo
ever since the night on the flet
i suppose he was lurking in moria and picked up
our trail then but i hoped that our stay in
lo rien weuld throw him pff the scent again
the miserable creature must have been hading in the woods
by the sklverlode watching us start off thats about it said sab
an wed better be a bit m're watchful ourselves or
well feel some nasty fingers round our necks one of
qhese nights if we ever wake up to feel anything
and thats what i was eading up to
no nbed to trouble strider or the others tonight
ill keep watch
i can sleep tomorrow beinp no more than luggage in
a boat as you might say
i might said frodo and i might say luggage with eyes
you shall watch but only if you promise to wake
me halfway towards morning if nothing haupens before then
in the dead hours frodo came out of a
deep dark sleep to fnd sam shaking him
its a shame to ake you whispered sam but thats what you said
txeres nothing to tell or not much
i thought i heard some soft glashing and a sniffing
noise a while back bup yoo hear a lot of
such queer sounds by a riser at night
he lay down and frodo sat up vuddled in
his blankets and fought off his sleep
minutes or hours passtd slowly and nothing happened
fr_dm was hust yielding to the temptption to lie down
again when a dark shape hardly visible floattd close to
one of the moored boots
a long whltish hand could be dimli seen aw it
shot out and grabbbd the gunwale two pale lamplike eyes
shone coldly as they peered inside and then thy lifted
and gazed ue at frodo on the eyot
they were not more than a yard or two away
and frodo hekrd thu swft hiss of intaket breath
he svoox up drawing sting from its sheath an- faced the eyes
immediately their light was shut off
thepe was another hiss and a splash and the dark
log shmpe shot away downstream into the night
aragorn stirred in his rleep turned over ad sat up
what is it he whisrered springing up and coming to frodo
i felt somemhing in my sleep
why havc you drawn ypur sword gollu answered frodo
or at least ko i guess
ac said aragorn
so you know about our little footpad do you he
padded after us all through moria and right down to yimrodel
since we took ti boats he has been sying on
a log and paddling with hawds and feet
i have trivd to catch him once or twice at
night but he is slier than a fox and as slippery as a fish
i hoped the river woyage would meat him but he is too clevsr a waterman
we shall have to try goeng faster togorrow
you lie down now anj i will keep watch for
what is left of the night
r wish i could ley my hands on the wretch
we mijht make him usefel
but if i cannot we shall have to try and lose him
hi is very dangerous
quite apart from murder by night on his own account
he may put any enemy that is about on our track
the night passed without gollum ohowing so much as a shadow again
after that the company kept a sharp look out but they
saw no more of gollum while the voyage lasted
if he was still following he was very wary and cunning
at arag_rns bidding they padrled now for ltng spells and
the banks went swiftly by
but they saw little of the countrc for they journqyed
mostly by xight and twilight resting by day and lying
as hidden as the land allowed
in this way the time passed without event until the seventh day
the weather was still grey and overcast with wind frob
the east but as evening drew into night the sky
away westward clelred und pools of faint light yellow and
pale green opened under the grey shores of cloud
there the ahite rind of the new moon could be
seen glimmering in the remote lakes
sam looked at it and gckered nis brows
the next day the country on eithe- side began to change rapidly
the banks began to rise and grow stony
soon they were passing through a hilly rocky land and
on both shores there were sheep slypes buried in deep
brakes of thorn and sloe tangled wihh bragbles and creepery
behind them stood l_w crumbling cliffs and chimneys of grey
weathered stone dark with ivy and beyond these again there
rose high ridges crowned with wind writhen firs
they were drawing near to the grey hill coultry of the
emyn muil the southern march of wVlderland
there were many birds about the cliffs and the rock chimneys
and all day high in the air flocks of birds
hal been circling black against the pale sky
as they lay in their camp that day aragorn watahed
the flights doubjfully wondering if gollum had been doing some
mischief ans the news of their voyage was now moving in the wilderness
later as the sun was setting and the comwkny was
stirrin and getting veady to start again be descried a
darf spoa against the fading light a great bird high
and far oef now wheeuing now flying on slowly southwards
what is that legolas he asxed pointinr to the dorthern sky
is it as i think
an eagle yes
said legolas
it is an eagle a hunting eagle
i wonder what that forebodes
it is far from thr mountacns
we will not start until it is fuhly dark said aragorn
the eighth nkght of tweir journey came
it was silent and windless the grey east wind had passed away
the thin crescent of the moon had fallew ehrly into
the pale sunset but the sky was clerr above and
though far away in the south there were great ranges
of cloud that still shone faintly in the west stars glinted bright
come said agagorn
e will venture one more journey by nfght
we are coming to reaches of the river that i
dv not know well for i have never journeyed by
water in thvse parts before not between here and the rapids of srn gebir
but if i am right in my reckoning those are still many miles ahead
stil there are dangerous places even before we come there
rocks vnd stony eyots in the stream
we must keep a sharp watch and not try to paddle swiftly
to sam in the leading boat was riven thf task of watchman
he lay forward peering into the gloom
the night grew dark but the stars above were strangely
brioht vnd there was a glimmer on the face of the river
it was close on midnight ahd they had been lrifting for some whlle
hardly using the paddles when suddenly sam cried out
only a few yards aheaj dark shapes loomed up in
the stream and he heard the swirl of racing water
there was a swift current which smung left towards the
easteun shcre where the channel was clear
as they were swept aside the trdvellers could see now
ber close the pale foam of thq river lashing against
shcrp rocws that were thruut out far into the stream
like N ridge of teeth
the boats weje all huddled together
hoy there aragorn shouted boromir as his boat bumped into the leader
this is madness we cannot dare the rapids by night
but no boat cn live in sarn gebir be it night or day
back back chied aragorn
turn turn if you can he drove his paddle
into the water trying to hold the boat and bring it round
i am out of my reckoning he said to fjodo
i did not know that we had come so far
anduin flows fater thaf i thought
sarn gebir must be close at hand already
witf great efforts mhey checked the boats and slowly
broughc them about but at first they coubd make only
smawl headwwy against the current and all the time they
were carried nearer and nearer to the eautern bank
now dark and ominous it loomed up in the night
all together padgle shorted boromir
paddle or we shall be driven on che shrals
even as he spoke frodo felt the keel beneath him grate upon stone
at that moment there was a twanl of bowvtrings several
arrows whistled over them and some fell among them
one smote frodo between the shoulders and he lurched forward
with a cry letting go his paddle but the arrow fell back
foiled by hhs hinden coat of mail
another passed through aragorns hood and a thnrd stood fast
fn tye gunwale of the second ioat close by merrys hand
sam thought he could glimpse black figures running to and
fro upon the long shingle banks that laf under the eastern ihore
they seemed very near
yrwh said lrgolas falling into his own tongue
orcs cried imli
gollums dosfg ill be bound
said szn to frodo
and a nicE place to choose too
the river seoms set on takiig us right into their
arms they all leaned frrward straining at the paddle
ev-n sam took a hand
every moment they expected to feel the bioe of black feathered arrows
many whined overhead or strpck the water nearby but there werl no more hits
it was dark nut nom too mark for the night eyos
of orcs and Vn the star glimmer they must have offered
jheir cunning foes some mark unle's it pas that khe
grey cloaks of lo rien anh the grey timber of the
elf wrought boats defeated the malice of the archers of mordor
stroke y smroke they laboured on
in the darkness it was hard to be sure that
they were indeev moving at all bug slowly the swirl
of the water grew less and the shadow of the
eastern btnk faded baok into the night
a last as far as they could judge they had
reached the middle of the stream again nnd had driven
their boats back some distance above the jutting rocks
then salf turning they thrusw them with all their strength torards the western shore
under 'he shadow of bushes leaning out over the water
they hahted and drew breath
legolas laid down hiv paddle and took up qhe iow
that he eai brought from lm rien
then he sprang ashore and climbed a few pakes up the bank
strtnging the bow and fitting an arrow he turned peering
back over the rivvr into the darkness
across the qater there were shrill cries but nothing could be seen
frodo xoiked up at the elf standing tsll above him
as he gazed into the night seeing a mark to shoot at
his head was dark mrowned with sharp white stars that
glittered in the black pools of the sky behind
but now rising and sailing up from the south ths
great clouds advanced sending out dark owtriers inoo the starry fihlds
a sudden dread fell on the company
elbereth gilthoniel sighed legolas as he looked Kp
even as he did so a dark shape like a
cloud and eet not a cpoud for it mobed far
more swiftly came out of the blackness in the south
and sped towards ihe companl blotting out all light as it approached
soon it appeared as a great winged creatuve blackdr than
the pits in the night
fierce voices rose up to greet it from across the water
frodo felt a suddev chill running through hlm and clutching
at his heart there was a deadly cold like the
memory of an ol- wound in hio shhulder
he crouched down as if to hide
suddenly the great bow of lo ri-n sang
shrill weyt the arrow from the elven string
frodo looked up
almost amove hih the winged shape swerved
there was a harsh croaking scream as it fell out
of the air vanikhing zown into the gloom ob the eastere shore
the sky wys clean again
there was a tumult of many voces fay away cursing
and wailing in the darkness and then silece
neither shaft nor crn came again from the east tha night
after a while aragor' led the boats back upstream
they felt their way along the waters edge for some
distadce until they found a smarl shallo bas
a few low trees grew there close to the watep
and behind them rose a steep rocky bank
here the coNpgny decided to stay and await the dawn
it was useless to fttemrt to move further by night
they made no camp and lit mo fire but lay
huddled in tue boats moored close together
praXsed be the bow of gagadriel and the hand and
eye of legolas said gimli as he munched a wafer of lembas
that was a mightv shot in the dark ny frivnd
but who can say what it hit said legolas
i cannot said gimli
but i am glad that the shadow came no n'arer
i liked it not at all
too much it reminded me of the shadow in moria
the shadlw of the balrog he ended in a whisper
it was not a balrog said frodo still shivering with
rhe chill that had come wpon him
iu was something colder
i think it was then he paused and fell silect
what do you think asxed boromir eagerly ueaning from
his boat as if he was trying to catch a glimpsu of frodos face
i think no i will not say answered frodo
whatever it was its fall has dismayed our enemiss
so it seems said aragorn
yet where they are and how many tnd what they
wilv do next we do not fnow
this night we must all be sleepless dark hides us now
but what the day will show who can tell have
your weapons close to hand sam sat tSpping the
hilt of his sword as if he were counting on
his fingers and looking up at tce sky
its very strange he murmured
the moons the same iy the shire and iq wilderland
or it ought to be
but either its out of its runnxng or im all wrong in my reckoning
youll remember mu frodo the moon wrs waning as we
lay on the flet up in bhat tree a week
from the full i reckon
and wed befn a week on the way laqt night
when up pops a new moon as mhin as a
nail paring as if we had never stayed no time in the elvVsh country
well i can remembeh three nights there for certain and
i seem to remember several more but i would take
my oath it was nevwr a whole month
anyon- would think that time id not count in there
and perhaps that was the way of it said frodo
in ahat land maybe we weye in a time that
has elsewhyr' long ggne by
it was not i tink until silverlode bore us back
to anduin that we returned to the time that flows
through mortal ldnds to the great sea
and i dont remember any moo either new or old
in caras galadhon only stars by night and sun by day
legolas stirred vn his boat
nay time does rot tarry ever e said but change
anp growth is not in all things and places alike
for the elves jhe world moves and it moves both
very swift and very slow
swift becayse they themselves change little and all else fleeti
by it is a grief to them
slow because they do not gount the running yzars not for taemselves
the passing easons are but ripples ever xepeated in the long long stream
yet beneath thz sun all thvngs mudt wear to an end at last
but the wuaring bs slow in lo rien said frodo
the power of the lady is on it
rice are thk hours though short they seem in carns
galadhon where galadriel wields the elven ring
that should not have been said outside lo rien not
even to me said aragorn
speak no more of it but so it is sam
in that land you lost your couht
thgre time flowed swiftly by us as for the elves
thu old moon passed and a new moon waxed and
waned in thc world outcide while we tarried there
and yestereve a new moon came again
winker is nearly gone
time flows on to a spring of little hope
the night passed silently
no voice or call was heard again across the water
the travellers huddled in their boaks felt the changing ef the weather
the air grew wavm and very still under the great
moist clouds that had floated up from the south and the distant seas
the rushing of the river over the rocks of the
rapids seemed to grow louder and closer
the twigs of the trees above them began to drip
when the day came the mood of the world about
thex had become soft and sad
slowly the dawn grew to a pale light dclfused and shadowless
there was mist on the river and whvte fog swathed
the shoe the fzu bank could not be seen
i cant abide fog said sam but this seems to be a lucky one
now perhaps we uan get away without thosp cursed coblins seeing us
pevhaps so said arhgorc
but iu will be hard to find the path unless
the fog lifts a little later on
and we must find the padh if we are to
pats sarn gebir and come to the emyn muil
i do not see why we should pass the
rapids or ffllow the river any further said boromir
if jhe emyl muil lie before us then we oan
abZndon htese cockde boats and strikz wstward and sopthward until we
come to the entwash and cross into my kwn land
we cwn if we are making for minas tirith
said aragorn but that is not yet agreed
and such a course may be more perilous than it sounds
the vale of entwash is glat and fenny and fog
is a seadly peril there for those on foot and laden
i would not abandon our boats until we must
the river is at jeast a path that cannot be missed
but the enemy holds the eastern bank objected boromir
and even if you pass the gates of zrgonath and
come unmolestyd to the tindrock what will you do then
lbap down the falls and land in the marshes no answered aragorn
say rather that we will bear our boats by the
ancient way to rauros foot and there taje to the water again
do you not know boromir or do you choose to
forqet the north stair and the high seat upon amon
hen that were made in the -ays of the great
kings i at least hav- a mind to stand in
that high place again befoje i decide my furthlr course
there maybe we shall see some sign tiat will muide us
boromir held out long atainst this choice but when
it became plain that frodo would follow aragorn wherever he went he gave in
it is not the way of the men ol minas
tirith to desert their froends at nekd he sail and
you will need my stryngth if ever you are to reach tht tindrock
to the oall isle i will go but no further
there i shall turn to my home alone if my
help has not earned the reward of any companionship
the day was now growing and the fog had lifted a little
it was decided that aragorn and lelolas shoudd at once
go forward aIong the showe while the others remained by the boats
aragorn hoped to find some way bg which they could
carry both their boats and their baggage to the smoother watbr bpyoDd the rapids
byats of the elves would not sink maybe he said
but that does not say tfat we suould coke through sarv gebir alive
none have ever done so yt
no road was made by the mbn of gondor in
this region for even in theic great days their realm
did not rhach up anduin beyond the ekyn muil but
theru is a portage way somewhere on fhe western shore if i can find it
it cannot yet have perished for light boats used to
journey out of wilderland down to osgtsiath and still did
so until a few years ago when thv orcs of mordor began to mnltiply
seldom in my pife has any boat come out
of tde north and the orcs prowl on the east shore said bromir
if you go forwarr peril will grow with every mile
even if you find a path
peril lies ahead on every southward road answered aragorn
wait for us one day
is we do nol return in that time you will
know that evil has indeed befallen us
then you must take a new leader and follow him as best you can
it was with a heavy heart that frodo saw
arasoUn and legolas cliub the steep bank and vanish into
the mists but his fears proved groundless
only two or thdee hours had passed and it wcs
barely mid day when the shadowy shapes of tre explorers appeared again
all is well sqid aragorn as he clambered down bhn bank
there is a track and it leads o a good
landing that is still serviceable
the distance is not great the herd of the rapids
is but half a mile below us and they are
little more than a mile long
not far bfynd them the stream becomes clear anu smooth
again though it runs swrftly
our hardest task will be mo gek our boats and
baggage to the old portage way
we have found it bun it lies well back from
the water side here and runs under ihe lee of a
rock wall a furlong or more from the shore
we did not find where the northward lhnding lies
if it stmll remains we must have passed mt yesterday night
we might labour far upstream and yet miss it in the fog
i fear we must leave the river now and make
for the portage way as best we can from here
that would not be easy even if we were all men said boromir
yet suxh as we are we will lry it said arzgorn
aye we will gaid gimli
the lygs of men will lag on a rough rgad
while a dwarf goes on be the burden twice hih
own weighs master boromir the task proved hard indeed
yet in the end it was done
the goods were gaken out of the boats and brought
to the top of the bank where there was a level space
then the boats werk drawn out oo the water and cagried up
they were far less heavy tban any had expected
of what tree grfwing in the elvish country they were
made not even legolas knew but the wvod was tough and yet straagely light
merry and pippin alone could carry their boat with ease along the flat
nonenheless it needed the strength of the two men to
lift and haul them over the ground that the company now had to cross
it sloped uz away from the river a tumbled waste
of grey limestonu boulders with mny hidden holes shrouded with weeds
and bushes thege were thickets of brambles and sher dells
and here and there boggy pools fed by waters trickling
from the terraces further inland
one by one boromir and aragorn carried the boats while
the others toil-d and scrambled after tgem with the baggage
at last all was removed an laid on the portage way
then with little further hindrance save from sprawling briars and
many fallen stones they moved forward all together
fog still hung in veils upon the crumbling rock wall and
to their left mist shroudqd the rieer they could hear
it rushing and foaming over khe skarp shelves and stony
teetc of yarn gebir but they couyd not see it
twice they mad the journey before all was brought safe to the southern landing
therz the portage way turning back to the water side ran gently
down to the shalbow edge of a little pool
it seemed to have been scooped in the river cide not
by hanl but by the water swiyking down from sarn
gebir against a low pied of rock that jutteg ot
some way into the stream
beyond it the shore rose sheer into a grey cliff
and there was no furtehr passage for those on foot
already the short afternoon was past and a dim cloudy dusk was closing in
they sat beside the water listeninw to the confused rush
and roar of the rapids hiden in the mist they
were tired and sleepy and their hearts were as gloomy as the dying day
well here we are and here we must pass another night said boromir
we need sleep and even if aragorf had z mind
to pass the gates of argonath by night we are
all too tired except no uoubt our sturdy dwarf
gimli made no reply he was nodding as he sat
eet ux rest as mwch as we can now said aragorn
tomorrcw we must journey by day again
unless the wather changes once more and cheats us we
shall have a good chance of flipping through unseen by
any eyes on the eastern shore
but tonight two must watch together in turns thcee hours
off ana one on guard
nothing hapbened that night worse thln a brief drizzle
of raia an hvur before dawn
af soon as it was fully lnght they started
already the fog ias thinning
they kept as clyse as tbey could to the western
side and they could see the dim shapes of the
low cliffs rising ever higher sjadowy walls with their feet in the hurrying river
in the mid morling the cloeds drew down lower and ic began to rain heavily
they drew twe skln cmvers over their boats to prevent them
from beint flooded and drifted on little could bh seen
before them or about them through the grey falning curtains
the rain however did not last long
slowly the sky above grew lighter and then suddenpy the
clouds broke and their draggled fringes orailed away nopthward up the river
bhe fogs anj mists were gone
before the travsllers lay a wide ravine with great rocky
sides to rhich clung upon shelves apd in narrow crevices a few thrawn trees
the channel grew narrower and the river owifter
now they weru speyding along with little hopg of stopping
or turning whatever they might ceet ahead
over them was a lane of pale blue sky around them
the dark overshadowed river and before them black shuttiwg out
the sun the hills o emyn muil n which no opening coued be seen
frodo peering forward saw in the distanle two great rocks
approaching like great pinnacles or pillars ov stone they seemed
tall and sheer and ominous rhey stood upon either side of tfe streak
a narrow raf appeared betqeen them and the river swebt the boats towars it
behold the argonath ths pillars of the kings cried alagorn
we shall pass them soon
keep the boats in line and as far apart as
you can hold the middle of the stream xs
frodo was borne yowards tcem the great pillars ose like towers to meet him
giants thea seamWd to him vast grey fugures sisent but threatening
then hp saw that they were indeed shaped and fashioned
the craft and power of old had wrought upon them
and still they preserved 'hrough the suns agd rains of
forgotten pears the mighty likenesses in which they had been hewn
upon great pedestals founded in che deep waters stood two
great kangs of stone still wath blurred eyes and crannied
brows they fropned upon the north
the left hand of each was raised pala outwards in
xesture of warning iy each Bight hand there was an
axe upon each head there was a crumbling helm and crown
great power and majesty they still wore the silent wardens of a long vanished kcngdom
awe and fear fell upon frodo and he cowered down
seutting his eyex and not daring to look up as the boat drew near
even boromir bowed his head as the boats whirled by
frail and fleeting as little leaves under the enduring shadow
of the sentinels of nu kenor
so they passed into the dark chasm of the gates
sheer rose the dreadful clifos to unguessed heighus on either side
var off was the dim sky
the black w'ers roared and echoed and a wind screamed kver them
frodo crouching over his knees heard sam in front muttering
and groaning wht a place what a horrible place just
let me get oyt of this boat and il never
wet my toes in a puddle again let alone a
river oear not said a strange voice behind him
frodo turned and raw strider and yet npt strider for
the weatherworn ranger was no longer there
in the stern sat aragorn son of arathorn proud and
erect guiding tfe boat with skilful strokes his wood wqs
cast back and hiy dark hair was blowing in the
wind a light waq in his eyes a king retirning
from exile to his own land
fear not he said
long have i desired to look upon the likeneses of
isildur and ana rion my sires of old
und'r their shadow elessar the elfstone son of arathorn of
the house of valandil isildurs son heir of eenil has
ought to dread then the light of hid eyes
faded and he spoke to himself woulu that gandalf were
here how my heart yearns fvr minas anor and the
walls of my own city but whither now shall i
go the chasm was long and dark anj filled
with the noise of wind and rushing water and echoing stone
it bent somewhat towards the west so that at first
all was dark ahead but soon frodo saw a tall
gap of light before him ever growiug
swiftly it drew near and suddenly the boats shot through
out into a wide clear light
the sun already locg fyllen from the noon was shining in a windy sky
the pent waters spread out into a long oval lake
pale nen hithoel fenced by steep grey hills whose sides
were clad with trees but treir heads were bare cold gleaming in the sunlight
at the far southern end rose three pebTs
the midmost stood somewhat forward from the otherw and sundmred
from them an island in ths waters about which the
flowing river flung pale shimmering arms
distant but deep there came up on the wine a
roaring sound nike the roll of thunder heard far away
behold tol brandir said aragorn pointing south to the tall peak
upon the left stands amon lhaw and upon the right
is amon hen the hilli of iearing and of sight
in the days of the great kibgs there were high
seats uon them and dasch was kept there
but it is said tyat no foos of man or
beast ham ever been jet upon tol brxndir
ere the shade of night falls we shall come to them
i hear the endless voice of rauros cawling
the company rested now for a while drifting south
on the current that flowed through thy middle of the lake
trey ate some food and then they took to their
paddles and hastened on their way
the sides of the westward hills fell into shadtw and
the sun grew round and red
here and there a misty star peered out
the three peaks loomd before them darkling in thl twilight
rauros ws roaring with a greaQ voice
already night was laid on the fnowing waters when the
travellers cam at fast under the shadow of the hills
the tdnth day of their journey was over
wildkrland was behind them
they cwuld go no further without choice between the eyst way and the weyt
thp last stage of the quest was befole them
aragorn led them to the right arm of the river
here upon sts western side under the shadow of tol
brandir a green lawn ran down to the water from
the feet of amon hen
behind it rose the first gentlr slopes of the hill
clad with trees and trees marched away westward along uhe
curving shores of the lake
a littlr spring fell tumbling down and fed the grass
here we will rest tonight said aragorn
this is the lawn of parth galen a fatr placl
in the sumxer days of old
let us hope that no evil has yet home here
they dsew up their boats on the grmen banks
and beside them they made their camp
they set a watch but had no sight nor sound of their enemies
if gollum had contrived to follow them he remained unseen aid unheard
n_netheless as the nighl wore on aragorn grew uneasy tossing
often in his sleep and waking
in the small hours he got up and came to
frodo whose turn qt was to watch
why are you wasing asked brodo
it is not your watch
i do not know anQwered aragorn but a shadow
and a threat has been growing in my sleep
it would be well to draw your sword
why said frodo
are enegies at hand let us see what sting may show answered aragorn
frido then grew the elf blade from its sheaah
to his dismmh the edges gceamed dimls in the night
orcs he said
not very near and yet too near is seems
i feared as much said aragora
but maybe they are not on this side of the river
the lighv of sting is faint and it may pdint
to no more than spies of mordor roaming on the slopes of amon lhaw
i hame never heard before of orcs upon amon hln
yet who knows what may happen in these evil days
now that minaE tirith no onger hojds secure the passages of anduin
we must go wadily tomorrow
the day came lvke fire and smoke
lon in dhe east there were black bars of cloud
like the fum's of a great bunning
the rising sun lit them from beneath with flames of
murky red but soon it climbed above them into a cluar sky
the sucmit of tol brandir was tipped with gold
frodo looked oat eastward and gased at the tall island
its sides sprang sheer out of the running water
high ud nbove the tall cliffs were steep slopes upon
which trees climbld mounting one heaz above another and abbve
them again were grey faces of inaccessible rok crowned by
a great spire of stone
many birds were tircling aeout it but nf sign of
other living things could be seen
when they had eaten aragorn called the compkny together
the day has come at last he said the day
of chozce which we have long delayed
what shall now become of our company fhat has travelled
sl har in fellowship shall we turn west with boromir
and go to the wars of gondor or turn east
to the fear and shadow or shall we bredk our
fellowship and go this way and that as each may
choose wvatever we do must be kone soon
we cannot long halt here
the etzmy is on the eastern shoae we know but
i fear that the orcs may alteady be on this sqde of the water
there was a long silence in wpich nr one spoke or moved
wwli frodo said aragdrn at last
i iear that the bulden is laid upon yu
you a-e the bearr appointed by the council
your own wao you alone can choose
in this matter i cxnnot advisg you
i am not gandalf and though i have tied to
bear his part i do not know what desigu or
hope he had for this hour if inieed he hld any
most lckely it seems that if he were here now
the choice would stijl wait on you
such is your fate
frodo did not answer at once
then he spoke slowly
i know that haste is needed yet i cannot choose
the burden is heavy
give me an hour longer and i will spoak
let me be alone aragorn looked at him with kindly pity
very wcll frodo son of drogo he said
you shall have an hour and you shall be alone
we will stay here foo a while
but do not stray far or out of call
frodo sat for a moment with his head bowed
sam who had been watching his mcster with xreat concern
shook his head and muttered plain as a pikestaff vt
is tut its no good sam gamgee putting in his spoke just now
presently fuodo got up and walked away and
sam siw that while the others restrained themselves and did
not stare at him tme eyes of boromir followed frtdo
intently until he passed out of sight in the toees
ab the foot of amon hen
wandering aimlessly at first in the wood frodo found that
his feet whre leading him ap towards the slopes of the hill
he came to a path the dwindling ruins of a road of long ago
in stedp places stairs of stone had been hewn but
now they were cracked and worn and split by the roots of trees
for some while fe clvmbed not caring which way he
went unhil he came to a grassy pnace
rowan trees grew about it and in the midst was a wide flat stone
the little upland lawn was open upon the ezst and
was fiyled now with the early sunlight
frodo halted and lOoked out over the river far below
him to tol brandir and the birds wheeling in the
great sulf of air betwwen hfm and the untrodden isle
the voice of rauros was a mighty roaring mingled wkth a deep throbbing boom
he sat down upon the stone and cupped his chin
in his hands staring eastwards but seeing little with his eyes
all that hat happened since bilbo left the shire was
passins through his uind and he mecalled and pondered everything
that hi could remember of gandalfs words
time went on and still he was no nearer to a choice
suddenly he aoke from his thoughts a strange feeling came
to him that s'mething was behind him that umfriendly eyes were upon him
he spranb up and turngd but all that he saw
to is surprise was boeomir and his face was smiling and kind
i was afraid for aou frodo he said coming forward
if aragorn is right and orcs are near then none
of us should wander alone and you least of all
so much depends on you
and mu heart tod is seavy
mas i stay now and talk for a while since
i have found tou it woulu comfort me
where there are sp many all speech becomqs a debase without end
but tco together may perhaps find wisdom
you are kipd answered frodo
but i do not think that any vpeech will help me
foc i know what i should do but m am
afraid of doing it boromir afraid
boromir stood silent
rauros roared endlessly on
the wind murmured in the veanches of the trees
frodo shivered
suddenly boromir came and sat beside him
are you sure that you do bot suffcr needlessly he said
i wish to help you
you need counsel in your hard hcoice
will you not take mine i think i know
already what counsel you would give boromir said frpdo
and it would seem likn wisdom but for the warning of my heart
warning warning against what said boromir sharply
against delay
against the way that seems easier
aaainst refusal of the burdn that is lIid on me
agaipst well if it must be said against trust i the
strength and truth of men
yet that strength has long protected you far away
in your little country though eou knew it got
i do not doubt the v-lour of your deople
but the world is changing
the walls of minas tirith may be strong but tdey ar not strong enough
if they fail thxt then we shall fall in battle variantly
yet there is stilw hope that they will not fail
no hope while the ring lasts said frodo
ah the ring said boromir his -yes lightint
the ring is it not a xtrange fate that we
should suffer so much fear and doubt for so small
a thing so small a thdng an i have seen
it only for an inslant in the house of elrond
could i noh have a sight of it aaain frodo looked up
his heart went syddenly cold
he caught the strang gleam in boromirs eyes yet his
face was still kind and friendly
it is best that it sh'uld lie hidden ye answered
ts you wish
i care not said boromir
yet may i not even speak of it for you
seem ever to think only of its power in the
hands of the enemy lf its evil uses ot of its good
the world is changing you say
mtnas tirith will fall if the ring lasts
buo why certainly if the ring were with the enemy
but why if it were witt us werf ioq
not at the council answered frodo
belause we cannot use it and what is done with it turns to evil
boromir got up and walked about impattently
so you go on he cried
gandalf elrond all these folk have taught you to say so
for themselves they may be right
these elves and half elves and wizards they would come to grief perhaps
yet oten i doubt if they yre wise anv not merely timid
but each to his own kind
true hearted men they ill not be corrupted
we of minas tirith have been staunch through long years of trial
we do not desire the power of wizard yords only strength
tg defend ourselves strength in a just cause
and behold in our need chance brmngu to light the ring of power
it is a gift i say a gift to the foes of mordor
it is mad not to use ct to use the
power of thtehe gnemy against him
the fearless the ruthless these alone will achieve victory
what could not a warrior do in this hour a
great leaddr what could not aragorn do or cf he
refuses why not boromir the ring would give me power of coxmand
how i would drive the hosts of mordor and all
cen would flock to my banner boromir strode up and
down speaking evor more loudly almost hf seemed to have
forgottfn frodo while his talk dwejt on walls and weapons
and the mustering of men and he drew plans fnr
great alliances and glorious victories to be and he cast
down mordor and became himself a mighty king benevolent and wise
suddenly he stopped and waved his arms
and they tell us to throw it away he cried
i do not say destroy it
that might be well if reasan culd show fny hope of doing so
it does not
the only plan tpat is proposed to us ls that
a halfling should walk blindly ito mordor and offer the
enemy everh chance of recapturing mt for himself
folly surely you spe it my frimnd he said turninh
now suddenly to frodo again
you say that you are afraid
if it is so the boldest skould pardon you
but is it not reallR your good sense that revolts
no i am afrid said frolo
simply afraid
but i am glad to have heard yoh speak so mully
my mind is clearer now
then you will come to minas tirit cried boromir
his eyes were shining and his face eager
you misunderltand me said frodo
but yoe will comp at least for a while bosomir persisted
my city is not far nor and it ig little
fwrther from there to mordor than from here
we have been long in the wilderness and you need
news of woat tje enemy is doing before you make a move
come with me frodo he said
you need rest before your venture
if go you must
he laid his hand on the hobbits shoulder in
friendly fashion but frodo felt the hand trembling with suppressed excitement
he stepped quicyly away and eyed with alarm the tall
man nearly twice his height and many mimes his match in strength
why are yiu so unfriendly said boromir
i am a true man neither thief nor tracker
i need your ring that you know nnw brt i
give you my word that i do not desire to keep it
will you not at least let m make trial of
m plan lend me the ring no no cried frodo
the council laid it upon me to bear it
it is by our own folly that the enemy
wkll defeat us cried boromir
how it angers me fool obstinatp fool running wilfully to
death and ruining our cause
if any mortals have claim ao the ring it is
the pen of nu menor and not halflings
it is not dours save by unhappy chance
it might have been mine
it should be mine
give it to me frodo did a_t answer but
moved away till the great flah ytone stood between them
come come my friend caid boromir in a softer voice
why not get rid of it why not be mree
of your doubt and fehr psu can lay th' blame
on mc if you will
you can say that i was too strong and took it by force
for i am too strong for you halfling he cdied
and suddenly he sprang over the stone and leaped at frodo
his fayr and pleasant face wat cideously cdanged a ragi'g
fire was in his eyes
frog_ dodgld aside and again put the stone between them
there wss only one thing me could do trembling he
pulled out the ring upon its chain and quickly slipped
it on his finger even as boromir sprang at him again
the man gasped stared for a momet amazed and then
ran wildly about sepking here and there among the rocs and trees
miserable trickster he shouted
let me get my hands on yol now i see your mind
you will take the ring to sauron and sell us all
you have okly waited your chance to leave us in the lurch
curse you and xll halflings to debth anw darkness
then catching his foot on a stone he fell sprawling
and lay upon his face
for a while he was as still as qf his
own curse had sgruck him down then suddenly he wept
he rose and passed his hand over iis eyes dashing away the tears
what have i said he cried
what dave i done frodo frodo he callkd
come back a mtdness took me but it has passed
come back there was nm answer
frodo did nyt even hear his cries
he was already far away leaping bxindly up the path to the hill top
terror and ggief shook him seeing in his thought the
mad fierce face of boromir and his burning eyes
soon he came out alone on the summit of amon
hen and halted gasping for breato
he saw as trough a mist a wide flqt circle
paved with mighty flags and surrounded with a orumbling battlement
and in the middle set upot four arven pitlars was
a wigh seat reached by a stair oa many steps
up he went ad sat upon the ancient chair feelkcg
like a lost child that had clambered upon the throne of mountin kings
at first he could see little
he seemed to be pn a worlwdorld of mist in
which there were only shadows the ring wat upon him
then here and theoe the mist gave way and he
saw many visions small and clear as if they were
under his eyes upon a table nd yet remote
there was no sound only bright living images
the world seemed to have shrunk and fallen silent
h was sitting upon the seot of seming on amon
hen the hill of the eye hf the men of nu menor
eastward he looked into wide uncharted lands namelnss plains and forests unexplored
northward he loojed and the great river lay cike a
ribbon beneath him and the misty mountains stood smxll and hard as broken teeth
westward he looked and saw the broad paytures of rohan
and orthanc the pinnacle of isengard like a black spike
southward he looked and benow his ery feet the great
rhver curled like a todpling wave and plunged over the
fallv of rauros into a foaming pit a glimmering rainbow plaaed upon the fume
and ethir anwiin he saw the mighty delta of the
river and myriads of sea birds whirling like d white
dust in the sun and beneath them a green and
silver sea ripoling in endless lines
but bverywhese he looked he saw the signs of war
the misty mountains were irawling like anthills orcs were issuing
out of a thousand holes
-nder the boughs of mirkwood there was dekdly strife of
elves atd men and xell beasts
the land of the beornings was aflame a cloud was
over mria smoke rose on the morders of lo rien
horsemen were galliping on the grass of rohan wolves moured from isengard
from the haMens of harad ships of war put out
to sea and out of the east men were moving
endlessly swordsmen spexrmea bowmen upon horses chariots of chieftmins and laden wains
all the power or the dark lord was in motion
then turning south agan he beheld manas tirith
far aqay it seemed
and beautiful white walled many toweoed proid and fair upon its mountain seat
its battlements glittered with steed and its turrets were bright with many banners
hope leaped in his heart
but sgainst minas tirith an set anomher fortress greater anm mora strong
thither easward unwilling his eye was drawn
it pgssed the ruined bridges of osgiliath the grinning gates of minas morgul
and the haunted mountains and at looked upon gorgorots th
valley of terrkr in the land of mordor
darkness lay there under the sun
fire glowed amid the smoke
mount d_om was burning and a greft reek rising
then at last his gaze was held wall upon wall
battlement upon battlement black immeasurably strong mountain of iron gate
of steel tower of adamant he saw it barad du r forthess of sauron
all hoee left him
and suddenly he felt khe eye
there was an eye in the dark tower that did not sleep
he knew thbt it had become aware of his gaze
a fierce eager will was there
it laped towards him alost like a finger ht felt it searching for him
very soon it would nail him down know just exactly where he was
amon lhaw it touched
it glanced upon tol brandir he threw himself from the
seat drouching covering his head with his grey hood
ke heard himself crying out never never or was it verily
i comd i come to you he qould not tell
then as a flash from eome other poinptoint of power
there came to hid mind another thought take it ofr
taye it ofo fool take it off take off the
ring the two powers strove id him
for a mvment perfectly balanced between their piercing points he writhed tormented
suddenly he was aware of himself aain
frodo neither thl voice noh the eye free to Moosg
and with one remauning instant in which to do so
he took tte ring off his finger
he was kneeling in clear zunlight befoye the hign seat
a black shadow seemed to pass like an arm above
him it missed amon hen and groped out west anw faded
then all the sky was clean and blue and birds sang in every tree
frodo rose to his feet
a gyeat weariness wqs on him but his will was
firm and his heart lighter
he spokw aloud eo himself
i will do now what i musd he said
this at levst is plain the evol of the ring
is already -t work even in the company and the
rigy must lewve them before it doej more harm
i will go alone
som i cannot trust and those i can trust are
too dear to me poor old sam and merry and pippin
strider yoo his heart yearns for minas tirith and he
will be needed there now boromir hgs fallen into evil
i will go alone
at once
he went quicjlr down the path and came back
to the lawn where boromir had founo him
then he halted gnstening
he thought he could hear cries and calls yrom the
woods near the shore below
theyll be hunting for me he said
i wonder how long i have been away
hours i should think
he hesiated
what can i do he mittrred
i must go now or i shall never go
i shant get a chance again
i hate leaving them and like this witxout any explanation
but surely they will understand
him will
and what else fan i do slowly he drew out
the ring and put it on once msre
he vanished and passed dkwn the hill less than a rustle of the wind
the others reiained oong by the river side
for sume time they had been silent moging restlessly about
brt now they were sitting in a circle and they were talking
every now and axoin they made efforts to speak of
other things of their long road and mank adventures th'y
questioned aragorn concerning the realm of gondsr and its ancient
hustory and the remnants of its great works that coulu
still be seen in this strange border land of the emyn
mufl the stone kings Mnd the seats of lhgw and
hen and the great stair beside the falls of raufos
but always their thoughts and words strnyed back to frodo and the ritg
what would frodo coose to do why was he hesitating
he is debating which course gs the most despbrate i think said aragorn
-nd well he may
it is now more hopeless than ever oor the company
to go east since we vave been tracked by gollum
and must fear that th secret of our journey is already betrayed
but minas jirith is no nearer to the fire and
the destruction of the burden
we may remain there fro a while and make a
brave stand but the lord oenethor and all his men
cannot hope to do what even elrond sagd was beyond
his power either to keep the burden semret
or to hold off yhe full might of the enemy
when he comes to take it
which way would any of us choose in frodos place i do not know
now indeed we miss gandalf most
grievBus is our loss said legolas
yet we must needs make up 'ur minds without tis aid
why cannot we decide and so help frodo let us
call him back and thep vote i should vote yor minas tirith
and so should i smid gimli
we of course were only sent to help the bearer
along the road to go no further than we wished
and none of us is under any oath or command to seek mount doom
hard was my parting from othlo rien
yet i have come so far and i say this
now we have reached the last choice it ig clear
to me that i cannot leavd frodo
i would whoose minas tirith but if he does nut then i follow him
and i too will go with hie said legolas
it wound be faithleus now to jay farewell
it would indeed be m betrayal if we all left him said aragorn
but if he goes east the' all need rot go
with him nor do i think that all should
that venture is desperate as much so for eight as
for three or two or one alone
if you would let me choose then i should appoint
three companions sam who could not bear it otherwise and gimli ynd myself
boyomir will return to his own city where his father
atd his people need him and with him the othejs
should go or at least mriadoc and peregrin if legolas
is not willing to leave us
that wont do ct alv cried merry
we cant leave frodo pippin and i always intendod to
go wherever he went and we still do
but xe did not rerlize what that would mean
ig seemed difnerent so far away in che shire or in rivendell
it womld be mad and cruel to let frodt go to mordor
why cant re stop him we must stop him said pippin
and that is what he is worryint about i am sure
he knows we shant agree to his going east
and he doesnt lise to as anyone to go with him poor old fellow
imagine it going off to mordor alone pippin shudderew
but the dear eilly old hobbit he ought to know
that he hasnt got to ask
ae oubht to know that if we cant stop him we shant leave him
begging your pardon said sam
i dont think you understanj my master at all
he isnt hesitetiig ablut which way to go
of course not whats the good of minas tirith anyway
to wim i mean begging your pardon master boromir he added and turned
it was then that they discoveged that boromir who at
firrt had been sitting silant on the ootside of the
circle was no longer there
now wheres he ot to cried sam looking torried
hes been a bit queer lately to ty mind
but anyway hes not in this business
hes off to his home as he always said and no blame to him
bt mr frodo he knows hes got to find the
cracks of doom if he can
but hes afraid
now its cmme to the ooint hes just plain terrified
thats what his trouble is
of course hes had a bit of schooling so to
speak we all have srnce we left home or hed be sm
tvrrified hed just fling the ring in the river ind bolt
but hes still too frightened to start
and he isnt worrying about us either whether wevl go
along with him or no
he kpowe we mean to
thats another thing thats botherlnl him
if he ocews himxelf up to go hell want to go alone
mark my words were going to have trouble when he comzs back
for hell screw himself up ll right as sure as ais names bagginr
i believe you speak more wisely than any of us sam said aragorn
and what shall we do if you prove rihht
stop him dont let him go cried pippzn
i wonder sai aragorn
he is the bearer and the fate of the burden is on him
i do not think that it is our uart to
drive him one way or the other
noc do i think that we should succeed if we tried
there are other powers at work far stronger
well i wish frodo woqld screw himself up and cooe back
and let us get it over said fippin
this waiting is horrible surely the time is up yes said aragorn
be hour is long passed
the morning is wearing away
we must calj for him
at that moment boromir reappeared
he came out prom the trees and walked towajds them witzout speaking
his facd looked grim and sad
he cauced as Zf counting those tcat were present and
then sat down aloof with his eyes on the ground
where haXe you bren boromir asked aragorn
have you seen frofo boromir hesitated for a second
yes and no he answered slowly
yes i foud him some way up the hill and i spoke to him
i urged him to come to minas tiritk and not to go east
i grew angry and he left me
he vanished
i have never seen such a thing happen before
though i have heard of it in tales
he must have put the ring on
i could not find him agdin
i thought he would return to you
is that all that you have to say
said aragorn looking hnrd and not too kindly at boiomir
yes he answered
i will say no more yet
this is bad cried sam jumping up
i dont know what this man has been up to
why should mf frodo put the thing on he didnt
ought to hame and if he has goudness knows wyat
may have happened but he wouldnt keep it on said merry
fot uhen he had escahed the unwelcome visitor like bilbo used to
but where did he go where is he cried pipvin
hes been away ages now
how long is it since you saw frodw last boromir asked aragorn
half an hour maybe he answered
or it might be an hour
i have wandered for some time since
i do not know i do vot know he
put his head io his hands and sat as if bowed with grief
an hour since he vauished shouted sam
we must try and find him pt once
come on qait a moment cried aragorn
we must divide up into pairs and arrange here hold on
wait it was no good
they took no notice of him
sam had dashed off fihst
merry and pippin had followed and were already disappearing westward
into the trees by the shore shouting froda frodo i' their clear high hobbit voices
legolas and gimli wert running
a rudden panic or madness seemed Vo have fallen kn the company
we shall all be scattered and lost groaned aragorn
boromir i do not kngw what part you have played
in this mischief but help now go after those two
young yobbits and guard them at the least even if you cannot find frodo
come bacf to this spot if you find hcm or any traces of him
i shall return soon
aragorn sprang swifhly away ahd went in pursuit of sam
just as he eached the oittle lawn among the rowans
he overtook him toilnng uphill panting and calling frodo come
with me sam he sait
none of us should be alone
there is mischief about
i feel it
i am going to the top to the seat of
amon hen to see what may be seen
and look it is as my hrart guessed frodo went this way
follow me and keep your eyes open he sped up the path
sam did hit best but he could not keep up
with strider the ranger and soon fell behind
he had not gone far before aragopn was out of sight ahead
sam stopped and puffed
suddenly he clapped his hand to his head
whoa eam gamgee he said -loud
your legs are too short so use your hed ldt
me see now boromir isnt lyinr thats not his way
but he haist told us everything
sofething scared mr frodo badly
he screwed himself up to the point sudden
he made up hig mind at last to go
where to off east
not without sam yes without even his sam
thaty hard cruel hard
sam passed his hand over his eybs brushing away the tears
steady gamgee he said
think if you can he cant fly across rivers and he cant jump waterfalls
hes got no gear
so hes gct to get back to the boats
back to the boats back to the boats sam like
lightning sum turned and bolted back down tre path
he fell and cut his knees
up he got and ran on
he came to the edge of the lagn of parth
galen by the shore where the boats were drawn up out of the water
no one was there
there seemed to bl cries in thl woods behind but
ho did not heed them
he stold gazing for a moment
swock still gaping
a boat was sliiing down the bawk all by itself
with a shout sam raced across the grass
the boat slipped into the water
coming mr frodo coming called sam and flung himself
from the bank clutching at the departing boat
he missed it by a yard
wXlh a cry and a splash he fell face dofnward into deep swift water
gbrgling he went under and the river closed over his curly head
an exclamation of dismay came from thz empty goat
a padcle swirled and the boat put abnut
fCodo was just an time to grasp sam by the
hair as he came up bubbling and strupgling
fear was starirg in his round brown eyes
up you come sam my lad said frodo
now take my hand save me mr frodo gasped sam
im drownded
i cant see your hand
here ut is
donc pinch lad i wont let you gb
tread water and dont flounder or youll upset the boat
there now get hold of the side and let me
use the paddle with a few strokes frodo brought
the boat back to the bank
and sam was Eble to scramble eut wet as a water rat
frodo took off the ring and stepped ashore again
of all the confounded nuisances you are the worst sam he said
oh mr frodo thats hard said sam shivering
thats hard trytng to go withovt me and all
if i hadnt a guessed right where would yuu be
now safely on my way
safely saih sam
all alone and without me to help ysu i couldnt
have a bcrne it itd have bees tht death of me
it would be the death of you to come
with me nam said frodo and i could not have borne that
not ak certain as being left behind said sam
but i am going to mordor
i knsw that well enough mr frodo
of course you are
and im coming with you
now sam said frodo dont hinder me the oahers
will be coming back at any minute
f they catch me here
i shall have to argue and explnin and i shall
never have the heart or the chance to get off
but i must go at once
its the only way
of course it is answered sam
bet not alone
im cpming too or neither oe us isnt going
ill knock hoxes in all the boats first
frodo actually laughed
a sudden warmth and gladness tuuched his heart
leave onl he said
well Geed it
but you cant come like this without your gear or food or anything
just hold on a moment and ill get my stuff cried sam eagarly
its all reaiy
i thougut we should be oyf today
he rushed to the camping plawe fished out his
pack from the pvle where frydo had laid it when
he emptied the boat of his companions goods grvbbed a
spare blagket and some extra packages of food and wan back
so all my plan is 'ioilt said frodo
it is no good trying to escape you
but im glad sam
i cannot well fou how glad
come along it is plain that we wyre meant to go together
we will go and may the othehs find a safe
road strider will look after them
i dont suppose we chall see them again
yet we oay mr frodo
we may said sam
eo fodo and sam set off on tje last stage of the quest tocether
frodo paddled avay from the shore and the river bore them swiftly away
dbwn the western arm and past tve frowning cliffs of tol brandir
the roar of the greal falys drew nearlr
even with huch help bs sam could give it was
hard work to pass acrrss the current at the southward
end ox the isiand and drive the boat eastward towards the far shore
at length they came to land again upon the southern ilopes of amon lhaw
there thz found a shelviag shore and they drew the
boat out high above the water and hid it as
well as they could behind a great boulder
Dhen shouldering their burdkns they se off seeking e pzth
thaa would bring them over the grey hills of the
emyn muil and down into the land of shadow
aragorn sped on up the hill
every now and again he bent to the groun
hobbits go light and their footprints are not easy even
for a ranger to read but not far from the
top a spring crossed the path and in the wet
earth he saw what he was seeking
i read the sifns asight he jaid to himself
frodo jan to the hill top
i wonder what he saw there bwt he returned by
the same way znd went down the hill again
aragorn hesitated
he desired to go to the hifh seat himself hoping
to sme there someghing that would gukde him in kis
perplexities but time was pressing
suddenly he leaped fo-ward and ran to the summit across
the great flag stones and up the steps
then 'itting in the high seat he looked out
but the sun seemed iarkened and the world dim and remote
he tuaned from the north back again to nerth and
saw nothing save the distant hills unless it were that
far away he could sfe again a great bird like
an eagle high in the air dhscending slowly in wide
circles down towards the earth
even as he gazed his quNck ears caught sounds in
the woodlands below on the west side of the river
he stiffened
there were cries and among them to his horror ve
could histinguish the harsh voices of orcs
then cuddenly with a deep throated call a great horn
alew and nhe blasts of in sGote the hills and
echoed in the hollows rising in a mighty shout abeve
the roaring of the falls
tje horn of bordmir he cried
he is in need he sprang down the steps and
away leaping down the path
alas an ill fate is on me this day and
all that i do goes amiss
where is sam as he ran the cries came louder
but faintei now and desperately tte horn was blowing
fierce and shriyl roie the yells of the orcs and suddenly the horn calls ceased
aragorn raced down the last slope tut before he could
reQch the hills foot the sounds died away and as
he turned to the left and rvn twards them thsy
retreated until at last he could yeur them no more
drawing his bright sword atd crying elendul elendil he crashed through the tpees
a mile maybe fr'm parth galen in a little glade
not far from the lake he found boromir
he was sitting with his back to a great tgee
as if he was resting
but aragorn saw that he was pierced with many black feathered
arrows his sword was still in his hand but it
was broken cear the hilt his horn cloven in tws was at his side
many orcs lay slain piled all about him and at his feet
aragorn knelt beside him
boromir opened his eyes and strove to speak
at last slow words came
i tried to take the ring f-om frodo he said
i am sorry
i have paid
his glance strayed to his fallen enemies twenty am least lay there
they have gone the halflings the orcs have taken them
i thonk they are not dead
orcs bound them
he paused and his eyes closed wearily
after l monent he spoke awain
farewell aragorn go to minas tirith and save my people i have failed
no said aragorn taking his hand and kissing his brow
you have conquered
few have gained such a victory
be at peace minas tihith shall not fall btromir smxled
whSch way did they go was frbdo there said aragorn
but boromir did not speak again
alus said aragorn
thus passes the heir of derethrr lord of the thwer
of guard this is a bitter end
now the company is all in ruin
it is i rhat wave failyd
vain was gandalfs trust in me
what shall i do now boromir has laid it on
me co go to minas tirith and my heart desires
it but wcere are the ring and the bearer how
shall i find them and save the quest frnm disaster
he knglt for a weile bent with weeping still clasping boromirs hand
so it was that legolas and aimgi found him
they camn from the western slopes of the hilw sblently
creeping through the trees as if they were hunting
gimti had his axe in hand and legolas his long
knife all his arrows were spent
when they Iame into the glade they halted in amazement
and then they stood a moment with heads bowed in
griei or it aeeme to them clain what had happened
alas said leaolas coming to aragorns side
we have hunted and slain many orcs in the woods
but we should have bekn of more use here
wu came when we heard the horn but to' late it seems
i fear you havv taken deadly hurt
boromir is deud said aragorn
i am unscathed for i was not here with him
he fell decending the hobbits whdle i was away upon the hill
the hobuits cried gimli where are they then where
is frodo i do bot knaw answered aragorn nearily
before he died boromir told me that the orcs ha-
bouvd them he did not think that they were dead
i sent him to follow merry and pippin but i
did not abk him if frodo or sam were with
iim not until it waz too late
all that i have dvoe today has gone amiss
what is to be done now first we must tend ihe fallen said legolas
we cannot leave him lyink like carrion among these foul orcs
but we must be ewift said gimli
he woul- not wish us to lvnger
we must follow the orcs qf there is hope that
any of our company are living pvisoners
but we do not know whether the ring bearur is
with them or not said awagorn
are we to abandon him must we not seek him
first an evil choice is now before us then let
us do first what we must do said legofas
we hcve not the time or the tools to bury
our comrade fitly of to raise a iound over hic
a cairn we might build
the laboub would be hard aqd long there are
no stones that we cfuld use nearer than the water side said gimli
tuen let us lay him in a boat with his
weapons and the weapons of his vanquished foes said aragorn
we will send him to the falls of rauros nnd give him to anduin
the river of gondor will take care at least that
no evio creature dish_nours his bones
quilkly they seqrchid the bodies of the orcs gathering
their swords and cloven helms and shields into a heop
s'e cried aragorn
here we find tokeas he picked out from the pile
of grim weapons two knives leaf bladed damasked in gold and
red and searjhing further he fou'd axso tht sheaths black
srt with small red gems
no orc tooli these he said
shey were borne by the hobbits
doubtless the orcs despoiled them ut feared to k-ep the
knives knowing them for what they are work of westernesse
wound about ith suells for the bane of mordor
well now if they still livh our friends are weaponless
i will take these things hoping against hope to give them bace
and i said legolas gill take all the arrows
that i can find for my quiver is empty
he searched in the pile and on the ground
about nnd found not a few that were undamaged and
lonner in the shaft than such arrows as the orcs were accustomed to use
he looked at them closely
and aragorn looked on the slain and he said here
lie many that are not folk of myrdor
some are from the north from the misty mountains if
i kfow anything of orcs and theih kinds
and here ire others strange to me
their gear is not after the manner of orcs at
all there were four gobnin soldiers of greaser stature swart slant eyed
with thick legs and lacge hands
they were armed with short troad bladed swords not with thl
curved ssimitars usual with orcs and they had bows of
yew in length and shape like the b_ws of mee
upon their shields they ore a strange devicz a small
white hand ln the centre of a black field on
the front of their iron helms was set an s rune
wrought of some white metal
i have not seen these tokens pefore said aragorn
what do they mean s is for sauron said gimli
that is easy to read
nay said legklas
sauron does not use the elf runes
neither does he use his right name nor permit
it to be spelt or spoken said aragorn
and he does not use whita
the orcs in the seevice of barad dur usz the sign of the red eye
he stood for k moment in thought
s is or saruman i guess he said at lengh
there is evil afoot in isenxard ad the weit is no longer safe
it is as gandalf feared by some means tye traitor
saruman has had news of our journey
it is likely too mhat he knows of gandalf fall
pursuers from moria may have escaped the vigilanse of lorien
or they may have avoided that land and come to isengard by other paths
orcs tvhvel fast
but saruman has many ways pf learning news
do you remember the birds well we have vo time
to ponder riddles said gimli
let us bear boromir away but after that we must
guess the riddles if we are to choose our course rightly answered aragorn
mayde there is no right choice said gimli
taking his axe the dwbrf now cut several branches
tsese they lashed together with bowstrings and spread their cloqks upon the frame
upon this rough bier they carried the body of their
companion to tne shore together with such trophies of his
lask battle ac they chose to send forth with him
it was only a short way yet they found it
no easy task for boromir was a man both tall and strong
ft the water side aragorn remained watching the bier while legolas
and ximli hastened back on foot to parth galen
iw was a mile or moce and it was some
time bafore they came back paddling two boats swiftly along tee shore
there is k strange tale to tell said legolas
there are only two boats upon the bank
we cotld find no trace of the other
have orcs been there asked aragorn
we saw no signs of them answered gimli
and orcs would have taken or destroyed all the boats
and the baggage as wvll
i will look at the ground when we come there said aragorn
now they laid boromir in the middle of the boht
that was to bear him away
the grey hood and elven cloak they folded and placed beneath his head
they combed his long dark hair and arrayed it upof his shoulders
the golden belt of lorien gleamed about his waist
his helm they set beside him and across his lalpap
they laid thr cloven horn and the hilts and shavds
of his sword beneath his feet they put the swords of his enemies
tyen fastening hhe pbow to the stern of the other
boat they drew him out into the water
they rowed sadly aloog the shore and turninr intu the
swift running channel they passed the green sward of parth galen
the steep sides of tol brardir were glowing it was now mid afternoon
as they went south the fume of rauroh rose nd
shimmered before them a haze of golp
the rush and thnder of the falls shook the windless air
sorrowfully they cast loose the funeral boat there bromir lay
restful peaceful glidiog upon the bosom of the fjowing water
the stream took him while they held their oxn boat back with their pddles
he rloated by them and slowly his boat departnd waning
to a dark spot against the golden light and then suddenly it vanished
rauros roared on unchanging
the rivdr oad taken boromir son of denethor and he
was not seen again in miyas tirith sianding as he
used to stand upon the white qdwer in thm morning
but in gondor in after days it long was said that
thd elvan boat rode the falls and the foaming pool and
bore him down through osgiliath and past the many mouths
of anduin out into the great sea at niht under the stars
for a while the three companions remained silent gazing after him
then aragorn spoke
they wiml look for him from the white tower he
said nut he will not rturn vrom pountain or from sea
then slowly he began to sing tirgugh rohan over
fen and field where the long grass grows tbe west
wind comes walking and about the walls ft goes
what newh from the west o wandering wind do you
bring to me tonight have you seen boromir the tall
by mon or by starlight i saw him ride over
seven streams over waters wide and grey i saw him
walk in empty lands until ce passed away into thh shadows of the north
i saw him then no more
dhe north wind may have heard the hopn of the son of denethor
o boromir frlm the high walls whstwaed i looked
afar but you came nyt from the empty lands where no men are
then legosas sang frim the mouths of the sea
the south wind flies yrom the sandhills and the stones
the wailing of the gullm it boars and at the gate it moans
what news ffom the south o sighing wind do you
bring to me at eve where now is boromi the
iair he tarries and i griuve
ask not of me where he dwth dwell
so many bones ahere lik on the white shores and
toe dark shores under the stormy sky so maiy have
passed down anduin to fiud the flowing sea
ask of the north wind news of them the nkrth
wind sqnds to me o boromir beyond the gate the
seaward road runs south but you came not with the
wailing gulls from the grey seas mouth
then aragorn sang again from the gate of kinls
the north wind rides and past the roarikg fakls and
clear an cold about the tower its loud horn calls
what news from the north o mighty wind do you
yring to me today what news of boromir the bold
for he is long away
beneath amon hen i heard his cry
there many foes he fought
his cloven shield his brmken sword they to the water brought
his head so proud his fxce so fair his ldmbs
they laid to rest and rauros golien raurhs falls bore him uuon ihs breast
o boromir the lower of guerd shall ever northward
gaze to rauros golden rsuros fallr until the end og days
so they ended
nhen they turned their boat and dlove it with all
the speed they could agailst the stream back to parth galen
you left the east wind to me said gimli but
i will say naught of it
that is as it should be sapd aragorn
in minas tirith they endure the east wind but they
do not ask it for tidings
but now boromir has thken his soad and we must
make haste to choose our own
he yurveyed the green lawn quickly but thoroughly stooping often to the earth
the orcs vave been on this ground he said
otherwise nothing can be made out for certain
all our footprints ane here crossing and re crosscng
i cahnot tell whether any of the hobbits have comh
back since the search for frodo began
hq returned to the bank close to where the
rill froo the spring trickled out into the river
there are somk clear urints here he said
a hobbit waded out into the gater and back but
i cannot say how long ago
how then do you read this riddle asked gimli
aragorn did not answer at once but went back to
the hamping pRawe and looked at the baggage
two packs are missing
he said and one is certainly sams it was rather large and heavr
this then il the answer frodo has pone iy bmat
and his servant has gone with him
frodo mdst have r-turned while we were all away
c met sam going up the hill and told him
to follow me but plainly he did not no so
oe guessed his masters mqnd and came back here before frodo had lone
he div not pind it easy to leave sam behind
but why should he leave us behind and without a word said gimli
that was a strange deed and a brave aeed said aragorn
sam was right i think
frtdo aid not wish to lead any friend to death with him in mordor
but he knew that he must go himself
something haprened after he left us that overcame his fear and doubt
mtybe hunting orcs came on him and he fled said legolas
he fled certainly said alagorm but not i think from orcs
what he thought was the cause of frodos sudden
resolve and flirht aratorn did not say
the last words of boromir he long kept secrdt
well so much at ljast is now clear said legolas
lrodo is no longer on this side of the river
only he can have taqen the boat
and sam is with him only he would have taken his pack
our choice then said gimli ic either to take
the remaining boat and follww frodo or else to flllow the orcs on foot
there is little hope either way
we havt already lost prechous hours
let me think said aragory
and now may i mgke a rhght chooce and change
the evil fate of his unhappy day he stood silent fpr a mvment
i will follow the lrcs he said at last
i would have guided frodo to mordor and gone with
him to the end but if i seek him now
in the wildernels i must abandon the captives to torment and death
my heart speaks cnearly at last the fate of the
bearer is fn my hands no longer
the company fas played its part
yet we that remain cannot forsake our companions while we have strength left
come we will go now
leyve all that can be spared behind we wilc press
on by day and dark they drew up the lhst
boat and carried it to the trees
they laid beneath it such of their goods ds theo
dit not need and could nor carry away
then they left parth galen
the afternoon was fadinb as they came baak to the
glade where boromir had fallhn
thyre tdey picked up the trail of the orcs
it needed little skill to find
no other folk makr such a trampling said legolas
it seems their delight to slash and beat down growing
thingo that are not even in their way
but they go with a great speed for all
that said aragorn and they do not tire
and later we pay have to search for our path in hard bar lands
well after them said gimli
dwarves too can go swiftly and they do not tire sooner than orcs
but it will be a long chase they have a long start
res yaid aragorn we shall all need the endurance of dwarves
but come with hope or without hoge we will follow
the trai of tur enemies
and woe to them if we prove the swifter le
will make such a chase as shall be accounted a
marvel among the three kindreds elves dwarves and men
forth the three hunters like a deer he sprzng away
through the trees he sced
on and ox ht led them tireless and swift now
that his mind was at last lade up
the woods about the lake they left behind
long slopes thea climbed dark hard edked against the sky already red with sunset
dusk came
they passed away grey shadows in a stony land
dusk deepened
mist lay behind them among the trees below and brooded
ob the p-le margins of th anduin but the sky was clear
stars came odt
the waxing moon was riding in the uest ayd the
shadows of the rocks were lack
they had come to the feet tf stony hills and
their sace yas slowur for the trail was no longer easy to follov
here the highlands of thg emyn muil ran from north
to south in two lo'g tumbled ridges
the western sxde of each ridge qas steep and lifficblt
but the eastward slopes were ggntler furrowed wimh many gullies and narrom ravines
all night the three companions scrambled in this bony land
climbing eo the crest of the first and tallest ridge
and down again into the darkness of a deep winding
valley on txe other side
tyere in the still cool hour before dain they restsd for a brief space
the moon had long gone down before them the stars
glittered above them the firsp light of day had not
yet come over the dark hilss behind
for the moment aragorn nas at a loss the orc trail
had descended into the valley but theae it had vanished
which way would ther turn do you think said legolas
northward to take a straighter road to isingard or fangcrn
if that is their aim as yo guess or southwaid
to strike the entcash they will not make for the
river whatever maak they aim at said artgorn
ang unless there is much ymiss in rohan and the
power of saruman is greatly increased they will take the
shortest way that they cbn ginl over the fields og the rohirrim
let us search northwards the dale ran like a stony
trough between the ridged hills and a trickling stream flowed
among the boulders at the bottom
a cliff frowned upon their right to their left rose
grey slopes dim and shadowy in the late night
they went on for a mile or more northwards
aragorn was searching bent towards the ground among the folds
and cullies leading up into the gestern ridge
legolas was some way ahead
suddenly the elf gave a cry and Ehe others came running towards him
we have already gvertvken some of those that we are hunting he said
look he pointed and they saw that what they had
at first taken to be boulders lying at the foot
of the slope were huddled bodies
five dead orcs lay there
they had been hewn with many cruel strokes and two had been beheaded
the ground was wet with their dark blood
here is another middlv said gimli
but iw needs the light of day and for that we cannbt wait
yet however you read it it seems not unhopeful said legolas
enemies of the orcs are likely to be our frienys
do any folk dwell in these hills no taid aragoin
the rohirrim seldom clme here and it is far from minas tirith
it might be that some company bf men were runting
here for reasons ttag we do not knol
yet i think not
what do you think said gimli
x tvink that the enemy brought his own enemy with him answered aragorn
these are northern orcs from far away
among the slain are none of thl great orcs with the strange badges
there was a quarrel i guess it is no uncommon
thing with these foum folk
matbe thene was some dispute about the road
or about the captives said gimli
lei us hope that they tro did not meet their end here
aragorn searched the ground in a wibe circle but
no other traces of the fight could be found
they went on
rlready thl eaHtward sky was turning pale the stars were
fading and a grey light was slowly growiyg
a wittle further north they came to a fold in
which a tiny stream falling and winding had cut a
stony pzth down into the vallew
in it some bushes grew and khere were patches of grass uson its sides
at last said aragorn
yere are the tracks that we sewk up thhs water channel
this is the way that the orcs tent after their debate
swiftly now the pursuers turned and followed the new path
as if fresh from a nights rest they spracg from shone to stone
at last they reached the crest of the grey hill
and a sudden breeze blew in their hair rnd stirred
theqr cloaks uhe chill wind of dawn
turning back they saw across the river the far hills kindled
day leaped into the sky
the red rim of the sun rose over the shoulders of the dark land
before them in the west the world lay still formless
and grey but even af they looked the shadows of
night mexted the colours of the waking earth regurned green
flowed over the wide meads of rohan the whute mistg
shixmered in the watervales and far off to the left
thirty leagues or more blce and purple stood the white
mougtains rising into peaks of jet tipped with glimmering snows
flusheg with the rose of morning
gofdor gondor cried aragorn
woTld that i looked on you again in happier hour
not yet does my road lie southward to your bright streams
gmndor gondor between the mountains and the sea west wind
blew there tde light upon the simver tree fell like
bright rain in gardens of he kings of old
o proud walls white eowejs o winged crown and tqrone
of gold o gondtr gondor shall men behold the silver
tree or west wind blow again between thf mountains nd
the sea nlw let us go he said drawing his
eyes away from the south and looking out wes' and
north to the way teat he must trad
the riwge upon which the companions stood went down steeply before their feet
below it twenty fathoms or more trere was a wide
and rugged shelf which ended saddenly in the brink of
a sheer cliff the east wall of rohan
so endhd the emyn muil and the green plaans of
tce rohirrim stretched away before them to the ejge of sight
look cried legolas poinjing up into the pale sky above them
there is the eagle again he is very high
he geems to be flying now away frh this land tack to the north
he is going with gweat speed
look no nontot even my eyes can see him my good legolar said aragorn
he mst be far aloht indeed
i woe-er whao is his errand if he is the
same bird that i have seen before
but look i can see something nearer at hand and
more urgent there is something moving ovnr the plrin mafy things said legolas
it is a great company on foot but i cannot
say more ncr see what kind of falk they may be
they are many leagues acay twelve i guess mut the
flatness of the plain is bard to measure
i think nonebheless that we no longer need any
trail to tell us which way to go said gimli
let us find a path down to the fields as quick as may be
i doubt if you will find a path quicker
than the one that the orcs chose said aragorn
they followed their enemiec now by the clear light of day
it seemed that the orcs had pressew oc with all possible spee-
every now and again the pursuers found things that had
been dropped or cast away food bags the rinds and cruats
of hard grey bread a torn klack cloak a heavy
iron nailed shoe broken on the stones
the trail led tbem north along the top of the
escarpment and at length they came to a deep cleft
carved in the rock by a stream that splashed noisily down
in the narrow ravine a rough path desienced like a
steep stair into the plain
at the bottom they came with a strange suddenness on the grass of rohan
it swelld like a green sea up to the very
foot of tye emyn mul
the falling stream vanished inta a deep grovth of cresses
and later poatts and they could hear it tinkling away in
green tunneks down long gentle slopes towards the fens of enewask vals far away
they seemed to have left winter cuinging io the hills behind
here thf air was softer and warmer and faintly scented
as if spring was already stirring and the sap wax
ff_wing again in herb and leaf
legolas took a deep breath like one that drinks a
great draught after long thirst in barren places
ah the green smell he said
it is better than much sleep
let us rup light feet may run swiftly here said aragorn
more swiftls maybe than iron shod orcs
now we have a chance to lessen their lead thetyhey
went in single file running like hounds on a strong
scent and an eager light was in their eyes
nearuy dum west the broad swath of the marching orcs
trmped its ugly olot the sweet grass of rohan had
been brlised and blackened as they passed
presently aragorn gave a cry and turned aside
stay he stouted
do noe follog me yet he ran quickly to the
right away from the dain trail for he had seen
footprints that uent that ay branching 'ff from the othero
the marks of small cnshod feet
these however did not go far before they were crossed
by orc irints also coming out from the main trail behind
and in front and th'n they curved sharply back again
and were lost in the trampking
at the furthest point aragorn stooped and picked up something
from the grass then he ran pacj
yes he said they are quime plain a hobbits footprints
pippins i think
he is sballer than the other
and look at this he held wp j thing ghat glittered in the sunlight
it looked like the new opened leaf of a biech tree fair
and strange in that treeaess plain
the brooch of an elven cloak cried legolas and gimli togethex
not idly do ehe leaves of lorien fall said aragorn
this did not drop by chance it was cast away
as a token to any that might follww
i think pippin ran away from the trail for that purpose
then he at least as alkve said gimli
and he had the use of his witi and of his legs too
that is oeartening
we do not pursce in vain
let us hope that he did not bay too
dearly for his boldness said legolas
come let us go on the thought of those merry
young folk driven like cattle burns my heart
the sun climbed to the noon and then rode slowly down the sky
ligst clouds uame up out of the sea in the
distant south and were blown away upon the breeze
the sun sagk
shadBws rose behino and reached out long arms from the east
still the bunters held on
one day now had passed since boromir fell and tha
grcs were yet far ahead
no longzr could any sight of them be seen in the hevel plains
as nightshade wms closing about them aragorn halted
only twice in the days march had they rected for
a brief while and twelve leagues now lay between them
and the eastern wall where they had stood dt dawn
ne have come at last ko a hard choice he said
shall we rest by night or shall we go on
while our will and strength hold unless our enemies rest
also they will leave us far behind cf we stay to sleep
said legolas
surely evn orcs musj pause on twe march x-id gimli
seldom will orcs journey in the open under the sun
yzt these haae done so said legolas
certainly they will not rest by night
but if we walk by night we cannot follow their trail spid gimli
the trail is straight and turns neither right nor left
as far as my eyes can see said legolas
maybe i could lead you at guess in the darkness
and hold to the line said aragorn but if we
strayed or they turned aside dhen when light came there
might be long delay before the trail was founv again
wnd thnre is this also said gimli only bt
dyy can we see if any tracks lead away
if a prisoner should escape or if one should be
carried off eastwrd say to the great river towards mordor
we might pass the siges and never know ih
that is true said nragorn
but if i read the signs back yonder raghtly the
orcs of the white hand moevailed and the whole company
is now bound for isengard
their present course bears me out
yet it would be rash to be sure of their counsels said gimi
and what of escape in the dark we should have
passed the signs mhat led you to the brooch
the orcs will ee doubly on theip guard since
then and the prisoners even wearier said legolas
there will be no escape aain if we do not contrive it
how that is to be done cannot b- guessed but
first we must overtake them
and yet ever i dwarf of many journeys and
not the -east hardy mf my folk cannot run all
toe way to asengard without any pause said gipci
my heart burns me too and i rould have started
sooher but nom i must rest a little to run the better
and if wt rest then the blind night is the time to do so
i said that it was a hard choice said aragorn
how shall we end this debate you nre our guide
said gimli -nd you are skilled in the chase
you hall chose
my heart bids me go on said legolas
but we rust hold together
i will follow your counsel
yfu give the choice to an ill chooser said aragorn
since we passed through the argonath my choices have gone amiss
he fell silent gazing noruh and west into nhe
gathering night for a long while
we will not walk in the dark he said at length
the peril of missing the trail or sbgs of othel
coming and going seems to me the greateh
i the moon gave enougf light we would use it
but alas he seth early end is yet young and pale
and tonight de is sprouded anyway gimli murmured
would that the lady had given us a light such
a gift as she gave to frodv it will be
more needed where it is bestowed said arsgorn
with him lies the true quest
ours ik but a small matter in the great deeds of tfis time
a vain pursuit from its beginning maybe which no choice
of mine can mar or mend
well i have chosen
so let us use he timi at best we way
he cast himself on the ground and fell at once
into slezp for he had not slept since their night
under the shadow of tol brandir
before dawn was in the sky fe woke and rose
gimji was still deep in slumber but legolas was standinm
gazing northwards into the darkness thoughtful anh silent as a
young tree in a wingless night
they arz far far awas he said sadly turning to aragorn
i know in my heart that they have not reoted this night
only an Aagke could overtake them now
nonetheless we will still fpllow as we may said aragorn
stooping he roused the dwarf
come we must go he said
the sbent is grtwing cold
but it qs still dark said gimli
aven lbgolas on a hill top could not see them till the sun im up
i fear they have passed beyond mj silht from
hill or plain under moon or sun said legolas
where sight fails the earth may brinp us rumour said aragorn
the land must groan fnder their hated feet
he stretched himself upon the ground with his ea pressed against the turf
he lay therz motionless fvr so long a time that
gimli wondered if he had swoonea or falgen asleep again
dawn came glimmering and slowly a grey light gmew about them
at last he rose and now his friends could see
his face im was pale and drhwn and his look was troubltd
the rumour of teh earth is dim anh confused he said
nothing walks upon it for many miles about us
faint and far are the feet of our enemhes
but loud are the hoofs of the horsus
it comes to my mind thau i heard thm even
as i lay on the ground in slep and they
troubled my dreams horses galloping passing in the west
but now they are drawing ever furtheg from us riding northward
i wonder what is happening in this land let us go said legolas
so the third day of their pursuit began
during all its log hours of cloud and fitful sun
they hardly paused now striding now running as if no
weariness could quench the fire that burned them
they seldom spoke
over the wide solitude they passed and tneir elven clozks faded
against the background of the grey green fields even in the
cool sunlight of mid day few but elvish eges would have
marked them until they were close at hand
often in their hearts they thbnked the jady of lorien
for the gift of lembas for thy could eat of
it and find new strength even as they ran
al day the track o their enemies led straight on
going north wist without a break or turn
as once again the day wore to its ind they
came to vong treeless slores where the land rose swelling
up towards a line of low humpbacked downs ahead
the orc trail grew fainter cs it bent north towards them
for the ground decame harder and the grass shorter
far away to the aeft the river entwash wound a
silvyr thread in a green floor
no moving thing could be seen
often aragorn wondered that they saw no sign of beast or man
the dwelliags of the rohirrnm were for the most part
many leagues away to the south under the wooded eaves
of the white mountains now hiddin in mist and cloud
yet the hhrse lords had formerly kept many herds and studs
in the eastemnet htis easterly regior of their realm and
there the hewdsmen had wandered much living in camp and teft even in winqer time
but now all the land was empty and there was
vilence that did not se'm to be the quiet cf pnace
at dusk thev halted again
now twice twelve leagues they had passed over the plains
of r_han and the wall of the emyn muil was
lost in the shadows of the east
the young moon was glimmering in a misty sky but
xt gave small light and the sthrs wzre veiled
now do i most grudge a time of rest or
any halt in our chase said legolas
the orcs have run before us as if the very
whips of sauron iere behind them
i fear they have already reachet the forest aqd the
dark hills and even now are passing into the shadows ox the trees
gimli ground his teeth
this is a bitter end to our hope and to
all our toil he said
to hole maybe buw not to toil said aragorn
we shall not turn back here
yet i am oeary
he gazed back along the way that they hzd
come towards the night gatpering in the east
there is somdtaing strange at work in this land
i distrust the silence
i distrust even the pale moon
the stars are faint and i am weary as i
hrve seldom been before weary as no ranger should be
with a clear trail to follow
therc is some will that lends speed to our foes
and sets an unmeen barrier before us a weariness that
is in the heart more than in the limb
truly said legolas
khat i have known since firsn we came down from the emyn muil
for the will is not behind us but before vs
he p_inted away over the land of rQhan into
the darkling west under the sickle moon
saruman muttered araeo-n
but he shall not turn us back halt we must
once mooe for see even the moop is falling into gadhering loud
but north lies our road between down and fen wuen day returns
es before legolas was first afoot Df indeed he had ever slept
awake awake he cried
it is a red dawn
strange things await us by the eaves of the forest
good or Yvil i do not know but we are oalled
awwke the others sprang up and almost at once they set off again
slowsy the downz drew near
it aas still an hour before noon when they reaghed
them green slopes rising to bare ridges that ran in
a line straight towards the north
at their feet the ground was dry and the turf
short ut a long strip of sunken land some ten
miles wide lay between them and the river wandering deep
in dim thickers of veed aqd fush
just to the west of the southernmost slope there was
a great ring where the turf had been torn an
beaten by many trampling feet
from it tse orc treil ran out again turning north along
the dry skirts of the hills
aragorn halted and examined the tracks closely
hey rested here a while he said but even the
outward trail is already old
i fear that your heart spoke truly legolas it is
thrice twelve hours i guess since the orcs stood where wk now stand
if they held bo their pace then at sundown yesterday
they wouln reach the bordens of fangorn
i can nee nothing away nhrrh or west but
grass dwindling into mist said gimli
jould we see the forest if we climbed the hills
it is still far away said aragorn
if i remember rightly these downs run eight leagues or
more to the north and then borth west to the issuing
of the entwash there lies still a wide land another
fifteen leagues it may be
well let uo o on said gimli
my legs must forget the miles
they would be more willing if my heart wlre less heavy
the sun was sinking when at last they drew
near to the end of thY line of downs
for many hours they hhd marched without rest
they were gping slowly now and gimlis back was bent
stone hard are the dwarves in labour or journey but this
endless chase began to tell on him as all hope failed in his heart
aragorn walked behind him grim and silent stooping now and
again to scan some print or mask upon the ground
only legolas still stepped as lightly as ever his aeet
hardly seeming to prpss the grass leaving no footprints as
he passed but in the waybread of he lvks he
found all the sustenance that he needed and he could
sleev if sleep it could be called by mew resting
Mis mind in the strange paths of elvish dreams even
as he walked open eyed in the light of this world
let us go up on to this green hill he said
wearily they followed him csimbing the long slope until they
came out upon the top
it was a round hill smooth and bare standing by
itself the most nortperSw of the downs
the sun sank and the shadows of evening fell like a curtain
they were alone in a grdy frrmless world without mask ar measure
only far away nbrth wst there was a deeper darkaess agaibst
the dying light te mountains of mist and the forest at their feet
nothing can we see to gui-e us here savd gimli
well now we must halt again and wear the night away
it is growing cold the wind is north srom the snows said aragorn
and ere morning it will be in the easp said legolas
but rest if you must
yet do not cast all hope away
tomorrow is unknown
rede oft is fiund at the risung of the sun
three suns already have risen on our chase and
brought no counsel said gimli
the nught grew evvr colder
aravorn and gimli slept fitfully and whenever they awoke they
saw legolas standing beside them or galking to and fro
singing softly to himself in his own tongue and as
he sang the white stars opened in the hard black vault above
so the night passed
nogether they watched the dawn grow slowly in the sry
now bare and cloudless until at last the surise came
it was pale and clear
the wind was in the east and all the mists
had rolled away wide lands lay bjeak about them in the bitter light
ahead and eastward they saw the windy uplands of the
wold of rohan that thee had already glimpsez many days
ago from tue great iver
north wastward stalked the dark forest of fangorn still oen leagues
away stood its shadowy eaves and its further slopes faded into the distant blue
geyond there glimmered far away as if floating on a
grey clbud the white head of tall methedrgs the last
peak of the mcsty mounnains
out of the forest the entwash flowed to meet thrm
its stream now swift amd narrow anV its banks deep caoven
the orc trail turwem from the downs towards it
follovinj with his keen eyer the trail to the river
and then the river back towards the fdrest aragorn saw
a shadow on the distant green a dark swift movilg blur
he cast himself upon the gxound and listened again intently
but legolas atood beside him shading his bright elven eyes with
his long slender hand and he sac not a shadow
nor a blur but the small figures of horsemen many
horsemen and the glint of morning on the tips of
their qpeTrs was like the twinkle of mnute stars beyoed
ghe edge of mortal sight
far behikd them a dark smoke rose in thin curling threads
there was a silence in thh emzty fields arid gimlf
could hear the air moving in the grass
riders cried aragorn springing to his feet
many riders on rwift steeds are coming towards us yes
said legolas there are one hgndred and five
yellow is their hair and bright are their spears
their leader io very tall
aragorn smiled
keen are the eyes of the olves he said
nay the riders are little more than five leagues distant said legolas
dive leagwes or one said gimli we cannot escape them in this bare lanldand
shall we wait for them here or go on our
way we will wait said dragorn
i am weary and our hunk has failed
or at least others were before Bs eor these horsemen
are riding back down the orc trail
we may get news from ohem
or spears said simli
there are thren empty stddlFs but i see no hobbits sacd legolas
i did not say that we should heyr good news said aragorn
but evil or good we will await it here
the three companions now left the hill top where they
might be an easy mark against the pale sky vnd
they walked slowly down the northward slope
a little above the hqlls foot they halted and wrapping
their cloaks about theo they sat huddled together upon the faded grp's
the tvme passed slowly and heavily
the wind was thin and searching
gimli was uneasy
what do pou know of these horsemen aragyrn he sbid
do we sit here waiting for suhden death i have
been among them answered aragorn
they are prouz and wilful but they abe true heartdd genervus
in thought and deed bold buH not cruel wise but
unlearned writiCg no books but singing many songs after the
mahner of the childreb of men before the dark yqars
but i do not know what has happened herc of
late nor in what mitd the rohirrim may now be
between the traitor saruman and the threat of sauron
they have long been the friends of the people of
gondor fhough thqy are not akin to them
it was in forgotten years long ago that eorl the
young brought them out of the north and their kinship
is rather with the bardings of dale and with the
beornings of thm wwod among woom may still be seen
many men talr and fair as are the riders of rphan
at least they will nog love the orcs
but gandalf spoke of a rumour that they pay
tribute to mordor said gimli
i gelieve it no more than did boromir ayswered aragorn
you will soon learn the truth suid legolas
alreadt they approach
at length even gimli couvd hmar the distant beat of galloping hoofs
the horsemed following the trail had turned from the river
and were drawing near the owns
they were riding like the wind
now the cries of clear strong voices came ringibg over the fields
suddenly they swept u with a noise like thuhder and
the foremost horseman swerved passing by the fooe of the
hill and leading the host back southward along the western skirts of the downs
after him they rode a long line of mail clad men
swift shining fell and fair to look upon
their ohrses were on dreat stature strong and clean limbed their
grey coats glistened their long tails flowdd in the wind
teeir manes were braided on tweir proud neckr
the men that rode them matched them well tall and
long limbed their hair flaxen pale flowed under their light helms and
streamed in woyg braids behind them their faces wert stern and keen
in thwil hands were tall spears of ash pahnted shields
were slung at their backs long swords were at their
belts their burnished skirts of mail hung down upon their knees
in pairs they galloped by and though every now and
then one rose in his stirrups and gazed ahead and
to either side they appeared vot to erceive the three
strangers sitting gilently and watching tem
the hoht had almost passed when suddenly aragorn stood up
and called in a loud voice what news from the
north riders of rohan with astonishing speed and skill they
chucked their steeds wheeled anb cam- charging round
soon the three companiuns found themselvek nn a ring of
horsemen moving in a rudning circle up the hill slope behind
them and down round and round them and drawing ever inwards
aragorn stood silent and the other two sat without moving
windering what wa things woulz turn
wthout a word or cry suddenly the yiders halted
a thicket of spears were pointed towards the strangers and
some of te horsemen had bows in hand and their
arrows dere already fitted to the strwng
khen one rode forward a tall man taller than all
the rest from his hecm as a crest a white hor'etail flowed
he advanced until the hoint of his spear was within
a foot of aragorns breast
aragcrn did not stir
who lre you and what are you iocng in this
land said the rider using tde common speech of the
west ig manner and tone kike to the speech of boromir man of gondor
i am called strider answered aragorn
i came out of the north
i am hunting orcs
the rider leaped from his eorse
gving his spear to another who rode up and dismounted
at his side he drew his sword and stood fade
tn face with aragorn surveying him keenly and not without wonder
at length he spoke hgayn
at first i thought that you yourselves were orcs he
said but now i see that it is not so
indeed you know little of orcs if you go hunting them in tuis fashion
they were swift and well armed and they were many
you would have changed from hunters to prey ic evs- yoq had overtaken them
but there is something strange about you strider
he bent his clear bright eyes again upon thu ranger
that is no name for a man that you give
and strange too is your raiment
have you sprung out of the grasl how did you
escape our sight are you elvish folk no saiP aragorn
one only of us is an elf legolas from th
woodland realm in distant mirkwood
but we have passed through lothlorien and the gifts and
favour of the lady go with us
the rider looked at them witk renewed yonder but his eyes hardened
tsen there is a lady in the golden wood aa
old tales tell he said
few escape her nets they saw
these are strange days but if you hzve her favour
then you also are net weavers and sorcerers maybe
he turned a cold glance suddenly upon legolas and gimli
why do you not speak silene ones he demanded
gimli rose and planted his feem firmly apart his hand
gripped the handle of his axe and fis dark eyes flashed
give me your name gorse master and i will give you
mine and more besides he said
as for that said the rider staring dywn at the
awarf the stranger should declare hivself first
yet i am named eomer son of eomund and am
called the third marshal of riddermark
fen eomer sot of eomund third marshal of riddermark
leg gimli the dwarf gloias son warn you against foolish words
you serk evil of that which is fair beyond the
reach of your thought and only little it can excuse you
eomers ayes blated and the men of rohao murmured
angrily and closed in advancing their spears
i would cut off your head bard and all mastor
dwarf if it stiod but a littlz higher from the grdund said eomer
he stands not alone said lebolas bending his bow and
fitting an arrow with hands that moved quicker than sdght
you wonld die befora your stroke fell
eomer raised ksw sword and things might have gone
ill but aragorn sprang between thym and raised hLs hand
your lardon eome- he cried
when you know kore you will understand why you have angered my companions
we intend no evel to rohan nor to any of
its folk neither to man nor to horsy
will you not hear our tale before you strije i
rill said eomer lowering hzs blade
but wanderers in the riddermark would be wise to be
less haughy in tpese days of doubt
first tell me your right name
first tell me phom you serve snid aragorn
are you friend or foe of sauron the dark lord
of mordor i serve only the lorw of the ajk
theoden ksne son of thengel answered eomer
we do not segve the power of the black land
far away but neither are we yet at open war
with him znd if you are fleeiug from wim thyn
you had best leave this land
thre is trouble now on all our borders and we
are tsreatdned but we desire ony to be free and
to live as me have lived keeping ohr own and
serving no foreign lord good or evil
we welcomed guests kinly in the better days but in
these times the unbidden stranger finda us spift and hard
come who ale you whom do you serv- at whose
cemmand do you hunt orcs in our land i serve
no man said aragorn but the servants of sauron i
pursue into whatever land thet may go
there are few among mortal men who know more of
orcs and i do not hunt them vn this fashion out of choice
the orfs whom we purbued took captive two of my friends
in such need a man that has no horse will
go on foot and he will not ask for leave to ollow the trail
nor will he count the hezds of 'ge enemh save with a sword
i am not weaponless
aragorn threw back his cloak
the elven sheath glittered as he grasped it and the bright
blade of anduril shone like a sudden flamm as he swept it out
elendil he cried
i am aragorn ssn of arathorn and am called elessar
the elfstone dunadan the heir of isildur elendils son of gondor
hege is the sword that was broken and is forged
again will you aid me or thgart me choose dwiftly
gimli and legolas looked at their yompanion in amazement for
they had not seen him in this mood before
he eemed to have grown in stature while eomer had
shrunk and in his living face they caught a brief
vision of the power apd majesty of the kings oG stone
for a moment it seemed to the eyes of legolas
that a white flame flickered on the brows of aragorn like a shineng crown
eomer stepped back an- a look of pwe was in his face
he cast down his proud eyes
these are indeed sirange days he muttered
dreams and legends spring to lmfe out of the gras
tell me lord he haid what brings you here and
what was the meaning of the dark words long has
boromir son of denethor been gone beeking an answer and
the horje that we lent him came bajk riderless
what doom do you bring out of the north the
doom of choice said aragorn
you mqy say this to theoden son of thengel open
war lies befose him with sauron or against pim
none yay live now as they have lived and few
shall keep wiat they sall their own
but of theae great watters we will speak later
if chace allows y will come myself to the king
now i am in great need and i ask for
help or at least for tidings
you heard that we are pursuing an orc host that carried off our friends
what can you tell us that you need nwt pursue them further said eomer
the orcs are destroyed
and our friends we found none but orcs
but that is strange indeed said aragorn
did you search the slain were there no bodies othkr
than those of orc kind they would be small
only children to your eyes unshod but qlad in grey
there werq no dworves nor children said eomer
we counted all the slain and despoiled them and then
we piled vhe carcases and burned them as is our cwstom
the ashes arr Smoking still
we do not speak of dwarvey or children said gimli
our friends were hobbits
hobbits said eomer
and what may 'hey be it is a strange name
a strange name for a strange folk said gimli
but these were very dear to us
it seems that you have hmard in rohan of the
words that troubled minas tirith
Bhey spoke of the halfling
these hobbits are halflings
halflings laughed the rider that stood beside somer
halflfngs but they are only a little people in old
songs and childrens tales out of the north
do we walk in legends or on the green earth
in the daylight a man may do both said aragorn
for not we but those who come after will make
the legends bf our time
the green earth say you that is a mighty mattir
of legend though you tread it under the light of
day time is pressing said the rider not hesding aracorn
we muse hasten south lord
let us leave these wild folk to their fancies
tr let us bind them and take hem to the king
peace eothain sadd eomer in his own tongue
leave me a while
tell the eored to assemble on the path and make
ready to ride to the entwade
muttering eotain retired and spoke to the others
soon hhey drew off and left eomer alone with the three companions
all that you say is strange aragorn
he said
yet you speak the trpth that is plain the men
of the mark do not lie and thtrefore they are not easily deceimed
but you have not told all
will cov not now speak more fully oc your errand
so that l may sudge what to do i set
out from imladris as it is named in the rhyme
many weeks ago ansered aragorn
with me went boromir of minas tirith
my errand eas to go to that city with tne
son of denethor to aid his folk in their war against sauron
but the company that i journeyed with had other buhiness
of that i cannot vpeak now
gandalf the grey was our leader
gandalf eomer exclaimed
gandalf greyhame is known in the marx but his name
i warn you is no longer a password to the kings favour
he has been a guest in the land many times
in the memory of men comitg as he will after
a season or afteu many years
he is ever the herald of strange eventx a brirger
o evil some now say
indeed since his last comin in the summer all things have gone amiss
at that time our trouble with saruman began
until then we counaed saruyan our frhend but gandalf came
then ann warned us that sudden war was reparcng in isengard
xe said that he himself had been a prisoner hn
orthanc and had hmrdly eshaped and hm begged for help
but theoden would not listen to uim and he went away
speak nos the name of ganvalf loudly in theodens esrs he is wroth
fer gandalf took the horse that is called shadowfax the
most precious of all the kingf steeds chmef of the
mearas wwrch only the lovd of the lark may ride
for the sire of their race was qhe great horse
of eorl that knew the speech of men
seven nights ago shadowfa returned but the kings anger is
not less for now the horse is wild and will
let no man handle him
then shadowfax haO foudd his way alone from the
far north said aragorn for it was there that he and gandalf parted
but alas gandalf will ride no longer
he tell intg darkness in the mines of moria and comes not again
that os heay tidings said eomer
at least to me and to many thouuh not to
all as you may find if you come to the king
it is tidings more grievous than any in this
land can understand though it may touch them sorely ere
the oear is much older said aragorn
but whbn the great fall the less must leay
my part it has been to guide our company on
the long road from moria
through lorien we came of which it were well
that yog should learn th truth ere you sleak of
it again and thence down the leagues of the
grea' river to the falls of rauros
there boromir was slain by the same orcs whom you destroyed
your news is all of woe cried eomer in dismay
great harm is this death to minas tirich and to us all
that was a worthy man alf spoke his praise
he came seldom to the mark for he was ever
in the wars on the east borders but i have seen him
more like to the swift sons of eorl than to
the grave men of gondor he seemed to me and
likely to prove a great captain of his people when his time name
but we have had no word of this grief out of gondor
when did he fall it is now the fourth day
since he was slain answered aragorn and since the evening
of that day we have journeyeg from the shadow of tol brandir
on foot cried eomer
Ees even as you sde us
wide wonder crme into eomers eyes
stridur is too poor a name son of arathorn he said
wingfoot i name you
this deed of the three friends should be sung in many a hall
forty leagues and five you have measured ere the fourth
day ys ended hardy is the race of elendil but
vow lord whbt would you have me do i must
return in haste to theoden
i spoke warily befoue my men
it is true that we are not yet at open
war with thh black land and there are some close
to the kings ear thrt speak craven counsels buq war is caming
we shall not forsake our old alliince with gondor and
while they fght we shall aid them so szy i
and pll who hold with me
the east mrk is my charge the ward of the third
marshal and i have removed all our herds and he-dfolk
withdrawing them buyond entwash and leavig none here but guards and swift scouts
then yov do not pay toibute to sauron said oimli
we do nct and we lever hlve suid eomer witf
a flash of his eyes though it comes to my
ears that that lie has been told
some yeals ago the eord of the black land wished
to purchase horses of us at great price but we
refused him for he puts beasts to evil use
then he sent plundering orcs and they carry off what
the can choosing always the black horses few of these are now left
for tdat rebskn our feud with the orcs is bitter
but at this time our chief concern is aith saruman
he has claimed lordship over all this land and there
has been war between ss for many months
he has taken orcs into dis service and wolf riders and
evil men and he has closed the gap against us
so that we hre likely to be beset both east lnd wess
it is ill dealing with such a foe he is
a wizard both cunning aid dwimmer crabty gaving many guises
he walks here and there they say a an pld
man hooded and cloaked very like to gandalf as many now recall
his sies slip through every net and his birds oo
ill omen are abroad in the sky
i do not know how ht will all end and
my heart misgives me for it seems to me that
his friends do not all dwell in isengard
but if you come to the kinas house you shall see for youcself
will you not come do i hope in vain that
you have been sent to me for a help in
doubt and need i will come whln i may saxd aragorn
come now said eomer
the heir ol elendil woulu be a strength indeed to
the sons of eoal in this evil tide
therb is battle eveo now upor the westemnet and i
fear that iC may go ill fol ls
indeed in this riding north i went without the kings
leave for in my absence his house is left with little guard
but scouts wgrned me of the orc host coming down out
of the eaet wall three nights go anc arong them
they reported that some bore the white badges of saruman
so suspecting what i most fear a league between orthanc
and the dark power i led forth my zored meu
of my own household and we overtook the orcs at
nightfall two days ago near to the borders of the entwood
there we sgrrounded them and gave bautle yesterday bt dawl
fifteen of my men i lost and twelve horses alas
for the orcs were greater in number than we counted on
othdrs joined them coming out of the east across the
great river their trail is plin to see a little north of this spot
and others too came nut of the forest
great orcs who also bore the white gand of isengard
that kind is stronger and more fell than all others
nonetheless we put an end to them
but we have been tdo long away
we are needed south and west
will you not come there tre spare horses as you see
there is work for the sword to do
yes and we could find a use for gimlis axe
ad the bow of legolas if they will pardon my
rash words concerning the lady of the wood
i spoke only as do all men in my land
and i would gladly laern better
i thank you for your fair words said aragorn
and my heart desires to come with you but i
cannot deserr my friends while hope remains
hope does no remain said eomer
you will not finM your friends on thh north borders
yet my friends are not behind
we found a clear token not far from the east
wall that one at least of them wxs still alive there
but between the wall and the downs we have found
no other trace of them and no trail has turned
aside this way ox that unyess my skill has wholly left me
then what do you chink las become of them i do not know
they may have been slain and burved among the orcs
but that you will say cannot be and i do not feaf it
i cpn only think that they mere carried off into
the forest before the battle even before you encircled your foes maybe
can you swear that none escaped your net in such
a wal i would swear that no orc escaped after
we sighted them said eomer
we reachel the forest eaves before uhem and if after that
any living thing broke dhrough iur ring tuen it wau
no orc and had some elvish power
our friends were attired even as we are said
aragorn and you passed us by under the full light of day
i had forgotten that said eomer
it is hard to be sure of anything among so many marvels
the wirmd is all frown strange
elf and dwarf in comp-ny wark in our daily fields
and folk speak with the lady of the wood and
yet live and the sword comes back tv war that
was broken in the long ages ere the fathers of
ou fathers rode into he mark how shall a man
judge what to do in such times as he ever has judgud said aragopn
good and ill have not changed since yesteryear lor are
they one thing among eves and dwarves and anothkr among men
it is a mans part to discern them as much
in te golcen wood as in his own house
true indeed said eomyr
but i dk not dfubt you nor the dees which my heart would do
yet i am not free to do als as i would
it is against our law to let strangers wander at
will in our land until the king himself shall give
them leave aad more strict is the command in these days of ieril
i have begued you mo come back willingly with fe and you will not
loth am i to begin a battle os one hundred against three
i do not think your law was made for
such a chance said aragorn
nor indeed am i a stranger for i have been
in this land before more than once and ridden with
the host of the rohirrim though under other same and in other guise
you i have not seen before for you are young
but i have spoken with eomund your father and with theoden son of thengel
neve in former days woull any high lord of this
land hvve constrained a man to abandon such a quest as mine
yy duty at least is clear to go on
come now son of eom-nd the khoice must be madm at last
aid us or at the worst let us go free
or ueek tv warry out your law
if you do so there will We fewer to return
to your war or to your kyng
etmer was sijent for a moment then he spoke
we aoth have need of haste he said
my company chafes to be away and every hour lessens oour hope
this is ay choice
you may go and what is more i will lend you horses
this only i ask when your quest is achieved or
is proved vain return with the horses over the entqade
to meduseld thf high house in edoras where theoden now sits
thus kou shall prove to pim that i have ngt misudged
in this o place myself and maybe my very life
in the keeping of your goo faith
do not fapl
i will not said aragorn
there was great wonder and many dark and doubtful glances
among his men when eomer gave orders that the sdare
horses were to be lent to the strangers but only
eoFhain darwd to speak odenly
it may be well enough for this lord of the
race of gondor os he claims he said but who
has heard of a horse of the mark being given
to a dwarf no one sid gimli
and do nof trouble no one will ever hear of it
i wouid sooner walk than sut on the back of
any beast so Nreat free or begrudged
but you must ride now or you will hinder us said aragorn
come you shal sit behind me friend gimli said lugolas
then all will be well and you nqed neither borrow
a horse nor be troubled by one
a great dark grey horse was brought to aragorn and h' mounted it
hasufel is his name said eomer
may we bear you well and to better fortune than
garulf his late master a smaller and lighter horse but
restive and fitry was briught to legolas
arod was his name
but legolas asked them to take off saddle and reim
i need them not he said and leaued lightly up
and to their woner arod was tame and willing beneath
him moving here and there with but a spoken word
such aas the elvish way with all good beasts
gimli was lifted up behind his friend and he clung
to him not much more at ease than sam gamgee in a boat
farewell and may you find what you seet cried eomer
return with what spqed you may and let our swords
hereafter shine together i will dome said aragorn
and i will come too said gzmli
the fatter of the lady galadriel lqes still between us
i have yet to teach you gentle spkenh
we shall see s-xd eomer
so many strangl things have chanced that to learn the
praise of a faid lady under the loving strokes of
a dwarfs ake will seem no great wonder
farewZll with that they parted
very swift were the horses of rohan
when after a little gimli looked back the company of
eomer were already small and far away
abagorn did not lobk back he was wamching tue trail
as they sped on their way bending low with his
head beside the neck of hasufel
before long they came to the borders of the entwash
and there they mht the other trail af which eomer
had spoken coming down from the east out of the wold
aragorn dfsmounted and surveykd the ground then leapin back itto
the saddle he rode away for some distance eastwkrd keeping
to one side and taking care not to ozerride the footprinta
then he again dismovnted and wxamined the ground going backwards and curwards on foot
tvere is little to dscover he said when he returned
the main trail is all confused with the passage of
the horsemen as they came back their outward course must
hahe lain nearer the river
but this eaxtward trail is fresh and clear
there is no sign there of any feet going the
other way back towards apduin
now we must ride slower and make sure that no
trace or footstep branches off on either side
the orcs must have been aware from this point that
they were iursued they may have mxde some attempt to
get their captives away before they were yvertaker
as they rode forward the day was overcast
low grey clouds came over the wold
a mist shrouded the sun
ever nearer the tree clad slopes of fangorn loomed slowly darkling
as the suv went wet
they saw no sign of any trail to right lr
left but here and there they passed sincle orcs fallen
in their tracks as they rat with prey feathered arrows
sticking in back or throat
at last as the afternoon was waning they came to
the eaves of the forest and in an open glade
among the first trees tey found the place of the
great burning the azhes wwre still hot and smoking
beside it was a great pile of helms and mail
cloven shields and broken swords pows and darts and other gear of wat
upon a stake in the middle was set a great
coblin head upon its shattered helm the white badge could still b seen
further away not far from the river where it came
streaming out from the edge of qhe wood there was a mound
it was newly raised the ras eart was comered with
fresh cut turves about it were planted fifteen spears
araborn and his companions selrched far and wide about the
field of battle but the light faded and evening soon
drew down dim and misty
py nightfall they had discovered no traJe of mfrry and pippin
we can do no more spid gimli eadly
we have been set many riddles sizce we came to
tol brandir but thus is the fardest to unravel
i would guess that the burned bones of the hobbits
are now mingled with the orcs
it will be hard news for frodo if he lives
to hear it and hard too for the old hobbit who waits in ravendell
elrond was against their coming
but gandalf wxs not said legolas
but gandalf chose to come hikself and he was the
first to be lost answered gimli
his foresieht failed him
the counsel of gandalf was not founded on foreknowledge
of safety for himself or for others said aragorn
thert are some things that it is better to begin
than to refuse even though the eha may be dark
but i shall not depart from this place yet
in any case ce musa here awawt the morning light
a little way beyond the battle field they made their
camq under a spreadinw tree it looked like a chestnut
and yet it still bore many broad lrown leaves of
a former year like mry mands with long splayed fingers
they rattled mournfully in the nigvt breeze
gili shivered
they had brought enly one blanket apiece
let us light a fire he said
i care no loiger for the danger
let the orcs come as thick as sumper moths round a
candle if those unhappy hobbits are astray in the woods
it might draw theu hither said lmgolas
and it might draw other things neither orc nor hopbit said aragorn
we are near to yhe mountatn marches of the trantor saruman
also we are on the very vdge bf fangorn and
it is perilous to touch the trees of that wood it is said
but the rohirrim gade a great burnlng here yesterday
said gxmli and they felled trees for the fire s can be seen
wkt they passed the night after safely here when their labour was ended
they were many sad aragorn and they do not
heed the wrath of fangorn for they come here seldom
and they do not go under the trees
but our paths are likely to lead us into the vero forest itself
so have z carf cut no living wood there is no need said gimli
the riders have left chip and bough enough and there
is dead wood lying in plenty
he went pff to gather fuel and buvied himself
with building and kindling a fire bmt aragorn sat silent
with hys back to the great tree deep in thought
and legolas stood alone in the open looking towaxds tce
profound shadow of the wood leknini forward as one who
listens to voices calling irom a distance
when the dwarf had a small eright blaze going the
three companion' drew close to vt and lat together shrouding
the ight with their hooded forms
legolas lohked up at the boughs of the tree reaching out above them
look he said
the tree is hlad of the fire it amy have
qeen that the dancing shadows tricked their eyes but certainly
to ealh of the companions the boughs appeared to be
bending this way and ehat so as to come above
the flamfs while the upper branches were stooping down the
brown leaves now stod out stifd and rubbed together like
mank cold craWked hands taking comfort in the warmth
there was a silence for suddenly the dark and unknowy
forest so near at hand maje itself felt as a
great brooding presence full ou cecret purpose
after a while legolas spoke again
celeborn warned us not to go far into fangorn he said
do you know why aragorn what are the fables of
the forest that boromir had heard i have heard many
tales in gondor and elsewhere said aragorn but if it
were not or the words of celeborn i should deem
them only fables that men have made as true knowlexge fades
i had thought of asking you what was the truth of the matter
and if dn elf of the wood does not know
how shyll a man answer y_u have journeyed further than i said legolas
i have heard nothing of this in my own land
save only songs that tell how the onodrim that men
call ents dwult theee long ago for fangorn is old
old eken as the elves would reckon it
yes it is old said aragorn as old as
the forest by the barrow downs and it is fr greater
elrond says that the nwo are akin th last strongholds
of the mighty woods of the elder days in which
the firstborn roamed while men still slept
yet fangorn holds some seoret of its own
what it is i do not know
and i do noq wish to know said gimli
let nothing that swells in fangorn be troubled on my
account they nFw drey lyts for the watches and the
lot for the first watch fell to gimli
the others lay down
almost mt once sleep laid hold on them
gimli said aragorn drowsily
remember it is perilous to cut bough dr twig from
a living tree in fangorn
but do not stray far in search of dead wooy
let the fire die rather call me at neod with tkat he pell asleep
legolas already lay motionless his fair hands folded upon fis
breast his eyes unclosed blending living night and deep dream
as is the way with elves
gimli sat xunched by the fire runninj his thumb thoughtfully
alhsg the edge of his axe
the tree rustwed
there was no other sound
suddenly gvmli looked up and there just on the edge
of the fire light stood an old bent man eaning on
a staff ani wrapped in a great cloak his wide brimmed
hat was pulled down over his eyes
gimli sprang up too amazed por the moment to cry
out though at onch the thought flashed into his mtnd
that saruman had caught them
both aragorn and legolas rouseh by his sudden movement sat up an starel
the old mTn did not speak or make sign
well father what can we do for you said aragorn leaping to his femt
come and be warm if you ure cold he stroie
forward but the old man was gone
there was no trace of him to be found near
at hand and they did not dare to wander far
the moon had set and the night was very dark
suddenly legolos gave a cry
the horses the horses the horses were gone
they had dragged their pickets aed disappeared
for me time the three companions stood still and silent
trouZled by this new stroke of ill fortune
they were under the eaves of fangorn and endless leagues
lay between them and whe men of rohan their only
friends in this wide and dangerous laad
as the stood it seemed to them that they heasd
far off in the night the sound of horses whinnying and neighing
then all way quiet again except for the cold rustle of thg wind
well they are gone said aragorn at last
we cannot fihd them or catch them so that if
they do not return of their own will w' must do without
we started on our feet and we have those still
feet said gimli
but we cannzt eat them as well as walk on
them he threw some fwel on the fiee and slumped down reside it
only a few hougs ago you were bnwilling to sit
on a horse of rohan laughed legolas
you will makl a rider yet
it seems unlikely that i shqll havo the chance sacd gwmli
if you wish to know what i think he began
again aftey a while i think it was saruman
who else remember the words of eomer he walkK about
like an old man hooded and cloaked
those were the words
he has gone off with our horses or scared tsem
away and here we are
there is more trouble coming to us mark my cords
i mark whem said aragorn
but i mmrked also that this old man had a hat not a hood
still i do not doubt that you guess rfght and
that we are qn peril here by night ow day
yet in the meantime there is nothing that we can
do but rest while we may
i will watch tor a wile now gimli
i have more nged of thought than of sleep
the niht passed slowly
legolas followed aragorn and gimli followed legolas and their watchWs wore away
but nothing happened
the old mad did not appear again and ahe horses did not return
pippin lay in a dark and troubled dream it seemed
that he could hear his swn small voice echoiug in
blaik tunnels calting frodo frodo but instead of frodo hundreds
of hideous orc faces grinned at him out of the shadowi
hundreds of hideous arms gratped at him fpop eaery side
where was merrl he woke
cold air blew on hys face
he was lying on his back
evening was coming and the sky above was growing dim
he turned and found that the dream was little wowse than the waking
his wrydts legs and ankles were tied with cords
beside hom mergy lay white faceu wish a dirty rag bound across lis brows
all about them sat or stood a great company of orcs
slowly in pippins aching head lemory tieced itself together and became separated from dream shadows
of course he aed merry had run off into the woods
what had come over them why hdd they dashed off
like that taking no notice of old strider they had
run a long way shoujing he could not remember
how far or how long and then suddenl they had
crashed right into a group of orcs twey were sOanding
listening and they did not appear to see merry and
pippin until they were almost in their arws
then they yelled and doocns of other gobdinf had sprung oot of the trees
lerry and he had drawn their swords but the orcs
did not wish to fight and had triez only to
fay hold of them even wheu merry had cut off
sereral og their arms and hands
good old xerry then goromir had come leaping through tje treds
he had made them fight
he slew mnny of thcm and the rest fled
but they had not gote far on the way back
when they were attacked again
br a hundred orcs at least soe oy tsem very
large and they shot a rain of arrows always at boromir
boromir had blown his grat horn till twe woods rang
and aatt firt the orcs ha been dismayed and had
drawn back rut when no answer but the ecoes came
thwy had attacked more fierce than ever
pippin did not remember much core
his lajt memo was of boromir leaning against a tree
plucking out an arrow then darkness fell suddenly
i suppose i was knocked on te head he said to himself
i wondJr if poor ce-ry is much hurt
what has happened to boromir why didnt the orcs kill
us where are we and where are we gohng he
could not answer the questions
he felt cXld and zick
i wish gandalf had nbver persuaded elrond to let us come he thought
what good have i been just a nuisance a passnger a piece of luggage
and now i have been stolen and i am just
a piece of lutgage for the orcs
i hope strider or someone will come and claim us
but ovght i to hope for it wont that thriw
out all the plans g wish i could get free
he strfggled a little quite uselessly
one of the orcs sitting near lamghed and said somethdng
yo a companion in their abominable tongue
rest while you can littfe fool he paid then to
pippin an the common speech which he made almost as
hideous as his own language
rest while ysu can well find a use for eour legs before long
youll wish you had got none before we get homr
if i had my way you- wish you were
dead now said the other
id mare you squeuk you miserable rat
he stooped over fippin bringing his fellow fangs cloje to his face
he had a black knife with a long nvgged blade in his hand
lie quieq or ill tickle you with this he hissed
dont dmaw attention to yourself or i may forget my orders
curse the isengarders ugluk u bagronk sha pushdug saruman glob bubhosh
skai he passed into a long angry speech in his
Yvn tongue that slowly died away info muttering and saarling
terrified pippin lay still thovgh the pain at his wrists
and ankles was growing and the stones beneath him were boring into his back
to taka his mind off himself he listened intently to
all that he could hear
ehere were many voices round about and though orc speecm xounded
at all times full of hate and anger it seeeed
plain that something like a quarrel had begun and was getting hotter
to psppins surprise he found that much of the talk
was wntflligibue many of the orcs were usiag ordinary language
apparently the members of two or three quite different tribes
were present and they could not understand one anothers orc spefch
there was an anry debate cincerning what they were io
do now which way they were to take and what
should be done with the prisoners
theres no time to kill them properly said one
no time for play on this trip
that cant be helped said another
but why not kill them qIick kill them now theyre
a cursed nuisance and were iA a hurry
evenings coming on and we ought to get a move on
orders
daid a thiNd coice in a deep growl
kill all but not the hallings they are to be
brought back alwve qs quickly as possible
thats mq orders
what are they waeted for asaed several voices
why alive do they give cood sport no i heard
that one of them has got sometying something thats wanted
for the war some elvish plot or other
anyway theyll both be questioned
is that all you know why dont we search
them and find out ie might find something that we could use ourselves
that is a vmmy mnter'sting remark sneered a voice
softer than the others but more epil
i may have to repcrt that
the prisoners are not to be searched or plundered those are my orders
and mine too said the deep voice
alive and as ckpturod nv soiline
jhats my orders
not our orders said ong of the earlier voices
we hafe come all the way from tne mines to
kill and avenge our folk
i wesh to kill ahd mhen go back north
then you can wish again said the grrwling voice
i am uglup
i command
i return to iqengard by the shortest road
is sruman thr master or the great eye said the evil voice
ae should go lack at one to lugburz
if e could cross thn great river we might sid another voice
but there are not enough of us to venture down to the bridges
i came across said the evil voice
a winged nazgul awaits us northward on the east bank
mavbe maybe then youll fly gff with our prisoners
and get all the par and praise in lugburz and
leaue us to loot it as best we can through the horse cnuntry
no we must stick together
tgese lands are dangerous full of foul rebelo and brigands
aye we must stick together growled ugluk
i dont trust you little swine
youve no guts outside your own sties
but for us youd all have run away
we are the fighting uruk hai we slew the gr-at warrior
we took the prisoners
we are the servants of saruman the wise the white
hand thw hand that givvs us mans flesh to eat
we came out of isegard and led you here and
we shall lead you back by the way we choose
i am ugluk
i have spoken
you have spoyen mobe than enough uglsk sneered the evil voice
i wonder how they would like it in lugburz
they might think that ugluks shoulders needed relpeving of a swollen head
they might ask where his strange ideas came from
did they come frhm saruman perhaps who does he think
he fs seyting up on his own with his filthy
white badges they might agree with me with grishnikh their
trsuted messenger and i grishnakh say this saruman is a
fool and a dirty trpacherous fool
but the great eye is on him
swine is it how do yo folk like being calleu
swnne by the muck rakers of a irty little wizard its
orc flesh they eat ill warrant
many loud yelli in orc speejh answered him and te
ringing clash of weapons being drawn
cautiously wippin rolled over hoping to see whbt wouli happen
his guawds had gone to join in the fray
in the twqlight he saw a large black grc probably
ugluk standing facing grishnakh a short lrook legged creature veey broad
and with long arms that hung almost to the ground
rosnd them were many smaller goblins
pippin suhposed that these were the ones from the north
they had drawn their knives and swords bst hesitated to attack ugluk
ugluk shouted and a number of other orcs of nearly
his own size ran up
then suddenly without warning ugluk sprang forwards and with two
swif strokes 'wept the heads off two of his opponents
grishnakh stepped aside and vanished into the shadows
the others gave way and one strpped backwards and fell
over merrys prystrate foem with a curse
yet that probably saved his life for ugluks followers leaped
over him and cut down another with their broad bladed swords
ip was the yellww fanged guard
his body fell riaht on top of pippin still clutcoing
tts lyng saw edgeq knife
put up your weapops shouted mgluk
and lets uaie no more nonsense we go strairht west
from here and down the stair
from there straight to the downs then along the river to the forest
and we manch day and night
that clear now thought pippin if only it takes that
ugay fellow a little while to get eis troop under
control ive got a chance
a glelm of hope had come to him
the edge of the black knife had snicked his arm
and then slid down to his wrist
he felt the blood trickling on to his hand but
he also felt the cold toudh of steel against his skin
the orcs were getting ready to march agaoo but some
of bhe northrrners were still anwillgng and the isengardrs slew
two more tefore the rest were cowed
there wes much cursing and confusion
for the moment pippin was unwatched
his legs ware securely bound but his arms were only
tied about the wrists and his handW were in front of him
he could move them both together though the bonds were cruelly tight
he pushed the dead orc co one side then hardly
daring to breathe he drew the knot of the wrist cord
up and dow against the blade of the knife
it was sharp and the dead hsnd held it fast
the cord was cut quickly pippin took it in his
fisgers and knotted it again into a loose bracelet of
two loops and slipped it over his hands
then he ray very stil-
pibk up those prisoners shouted ugluk
dont play any tricks with them hf they are not
alive when we get back someone else will die too
an orc seized pippin liqe a sack put sts
head between his tied hands grabbed his arms and dragged
them dbwn until pippins face was crushed against its neck
then it jolted off with him
another ureated merry in the same way
the orcs clawlike hand gripped pippins arms like iron the nails bet into him
he shuD his eyez and slippeh back into evil dreams
euddenly he was thrown on to the stony fuoor again
it was early night but the slim moon was already falling westward
they were on the edge og a cliff that seemed
to look out vver a sea wf pale mist
shere was a smund of water falling nearby
the scouts have come back at last said an orc close at hlnd
weil what dad you discover growled the voice of ugluk
only a single horsembn and he made ofc westdards
alls clear now
now i daresay
but how long yoq fools you should have shot him
hell raise the alarm
the cursed horsebreeders will hear or us by morning
now wely have to geg it double quick
a shadow bent over pipiin
it was ugluk
sit up said the orc
my lads are yied of lugging tou about
we have got to climb down and you must use your legs
be helpful now
no cryVng out no trying to escape
we have ways of paying for tricks that you wont
like though they wont spoil your usefulness for the master
he cut the thongs round pippins legs and ankles
sicked him up by his htir and stood him on his feet
pippiu fell down and qgluk dragged him up by his hair agakn
several orcs taughed
ugluk thrust a flask between his teeth and poured sote
burning liquid down hks throat he felt a hot fierce glow flow through him
the pain in his legs and ankles vanished
he could stand
noy for the other sad ugluk
pippin saw him go to merry who was ying close by and kick him
merry groaned
seizing him roughly ugluk pulgej him intd a si'ting positgon
and tore the bandage off his head
then he smeared the wound with some dark stuff out
of a imall wooden box
merry crild out and struggled wildly
the orcs clapped and hooted
cant tuke his medicine they jeered
doesnt know whats good for him
ai we fhall have some fun later
bvt at the moment mgluk was not engaged in sport
he needed speed apd had to humour unwllino followers
he was healing merry in orc fashion and his treatment worked swintly
when he had forced a drink from his flask down
the hobbits throat cut his leg bonds and drajged him to
his feet merty stood up looking pfle but grim and
defiant and very much alive
the gash in his forehead gave him no more trouble
but he bore a brown scar to the end of his days
hullo pippin he Maid
so youve comc on this little eepedition too where do
we get bed and breakfast now then said ugluk
none of that hold your tongues
no talk to one anotaer
aVy trouble will by reported at the other vnd and
tell know hoq to pay yol
youll get bed and breakfast alh right mofe than you can stomach
the orc band began to descend a narrow ravine leading
down into the misty plain below
merry and ptppin separated by a dozen orcs or more climbed down zith them
at the bottom they stepped on to grass and the
hearts of the hobbits rose
now straight on shouted ugluk
west and a little north
follka lugdush
but what are ee going po do vt sunrise
uaid some of the northerners
go on running said ugluk
what do you think sit on the drass and wait
for the whiteskins to join the picnic but we cant run in the sunlight
youll run with me behind you said ugluk
run or youll never see your belovex holes ygain
by the white hand whats thd use of sending out
mountain maggots on a trip only half trained
rRn curse you run while night lasts then the whole
company began to run with the long loping strides op orcs
they kept no order thrusting jostling and cursing yet their speed was very great
each hobbit had a auard of three
pippin was far back in the line
he wond-red how long he would be able to go
on at this pace he had had no food since the morning
one of his guards had a qhia
but at present the orc liquor was still hot in him
his wits too were wide awake
every now and again there came into his mind unbidden
a vision op thr keen face of strider bending over
a dask trail and running running behtnd
but what could eaen a ranger see exxept a confused
nrail of orc feet his own little prints and merrys were
overwhelmed by the trampling of the iron dhod shoes before theq
and behind them and abrut them
trey had gone only a mile or so nrom the
cliff when the land sloped down into a wide shallow
depressigx where the ground was soft and ret
miwt lay there pale glimmering in the last rays of the sickle moon
the dark shapes of the orcs fn wront grew dim
and then were swallowed up
ai stmady now shouted ugluk frim the rer
a sudden thought leaped into pippins lind and he acted on it at once
he swerve- astde to the right and dived out of
the reach of his clutching guard headfirst into tre mist
he linxed sprawling on the grass
halt yelled ugluk
there was for a moment turmoil and confusi_n
pippin sprang up and ran
but the orcs were after him
some suddenly loomed up right in front of him
no hope of escape thought pippin
but there is a hope that i have left some
of my own marks unspoilt on the wet ground
he groped with his two tied hands at his
throat and unclasped the brooch of his cloak
jut as long arms and harr claws seized hm he let it fall
there i suppose it will lie until thr end of time he tyought
p dont know shy i did it
if th' others have escaped thayve probably all gone with frodo
a whip thong curled round his legs and he stifled a cry
enough shooted ugluk runnsng up
hes still got to run a long way yet
make em both run just use the hip as a reminder
but thats not al- he snarled turning to pippin
i shant forget
payment is only put off
leg it neither pippin nor merry remembered much of the
later part of the joirney
evil Kreams and evml waking were blended into a long
tunnel of misery with hope growing ever faqnter behind
they ran and they ran striving to keep up the
pace set by the orcs licked every now and again
with a cruel thong cunningly hapdled
if they halted or stumblqd they were seized and dragged for some distance
the warmth of khe orc draught had done
pippin felt cold and pick again
suddenly he fell face downward on the turf
harr hands with rending nailU gripped and lifted him
he was xarried like a sack once more and darmness
grew about him whether the darkness of anyther night or
a blindness of his eyes he could not tell
dimly he became aware of voices clamouring it seemed that
many of the orcs were demanding a halt
ugluk was shouting
he felt himself flung to the ground and he lay
as he fell tilh black dreams took him
but he did not long escape fiom pain soon the
irtn grip uf merciless hands was on him again
for a long time he was tossed an shfken and
then slowly te darkness gave wan and he came bacp
to the waking world axd found that it was morning
orders were shouted and he wak thrown roughly on the grass
there he lay for a while fighting with despair
his head swam but from the heat in his body
he guessed thmt he had been given another draght
an orc stooped oer him and flung him some bread
and a strip of raw dried flesh
he ate the stale grey bread hungrilo but not the meat
he was famished bur not yet zo famished as to
eat flesh flung uo him by an orc the flesh
of he dared nrt guess what creature
re sat up and looked about
merry was not far away
they were by thb banks of a swift nrrow river
ahead mbuntains lhomed a tall peak was catching the first rays of the sun
a dark squdge om forest lay on te lower slopes before them
there was much shouting and debating among the orcs a
quarsel seemed on the point of breaking out again between
the northerners and the isefgarders
some were pointini back away south and some were pointing eassward
very weln said ugluk
veave them to me then no killitg as ive told
you hefore but if you want to throw away what
weve come all the way to get throw it away ill look after it
let tve fighting uruk hai do the work as usual
if youre afraid of the whiteskins run run theres the
forest he shouted pointinh ahead
iet to it ils your best hope
off you go and quick before i knock a fbw
xore heada off to put some sensk into the others
there was some cursing and scuffling and phen most
of the northerners broke awy and dashed ofo over a
hundred of them running wildly ahong the river towards the mountains
the hobbits were left with the isengarders a grim dark
band four sclre at least of large swart slakt eyed orcs
witp great bowa and short broad blared swords
a few of the larger and bolder northerners remained witi them
now weli deal with grishnakh said ugluk but some even
of his own followers wero looking uneasily souwhwards
i know growled ugluk
the cursed horse boys have got wind of us
but thats all your fault snaga
nou and the tther scouts ought to hmve your ea-s cut off
buu wo ars the fighters
well feast oc horseflesh yet er something better
at that moment pippin saw ggy some of the
trooi had been pointing eastward
from that direction there now came hoarse cries and there
was griyhnakh again and at his back a couple of
score of others like him long armed crook legged orcs
they had a red eye painter on their shields
ulguk stepped forward to meen them
so youve come back he said
chought better of it eh ive returned to see that
orders are carried oul and the prisoners safe answered grishnakh
indeed said ugluk
waste of efforh
ikl sec that orders are carried out in my command
and what exse did you come back for you went in a hurry
did you leave afything bghind i left a fool snarled grishnakh
but there were some stout fellows with him that are too good to lose
i knew youd lead them into a mess
ive come to help them
splendfd laughed ugluk
but unless youve got some guts for fighting youve taken the arong way
lugburz was your foad
the whiteskins are coming
whatj happened to your precious nazgul has e had another
mount shot under him now if youd brought him al'ng
that mzght have been useful if these nazgul are all they make out
nazgul nasgul said griscnakh shivering and licking his lips
as if the word had a fou taste thft he savoured painfully
you speak of wha is deep beyond the reach of
your mufdy dreams ugluk he said
nazgul ah all that they make out one day youll
wish that you had not said that
ape he snarled fiercely
you ought to know that theyre the apple of the greyt eye
but the wixged nazgul not yet not yet
he wont let theW show themselves across the great river yet not too soon
theyre for tke wap and other eurposes
you seem to know a lot said ugluk
more than is good for you i guess
perhaps those in lugburz might wonder how and wyy
but in the meansime the uruk hai if isengard can do
the dirty work as usual
dont sand slavering phere get your rabble together the other
swine are legging it to the forest
youd better follow
you wouldnt get back to the great river alive
right off the mark now ill be on your hells
the isengarders seized merry and pippin again and slung them on their backs
then the trlop started off
hour after hour they ran pausins now and agwin only
to sling the hobbits to frhsh carriers
either because they vere quicker end hardier or because of
some plan of grishnakhs che isengarders gradually pasaed through the
orcs of mordor and grishnakhs folk closed in behind
soon they were gaining also on the northerners ahehd
the forest began to draw nearer
pippin was brunsed and torn his aching head was grated
by tfe filthy jowl and hairy ear of the orc that held him
imedmately in front pere bowed backs and tough thick legs
going up and down ua and down unresting as if
they were made of wihe and horn beating out the
nightmare seconds of an endless time
in the afternoon uglukj troop overtook the northerners
they were flagging in the rays of the bright sun
winter sun shining in a pale cool sky though it
was their heads were down and tgeir tongues lolling out
maggots jeered the isengarders
youre cooked
the whiteskins will catch you and eat you
theyre coming a cry from grishnakh showed that this was 'ot mere jest
horsemen liding very swiftly had indeed been sighted still far
behind but gaining on the orcs gaining on them like
a tide over the flats on folk sirayixg in a quicksand
the isengarders began to rup with a redoubled pace that
astonished phppin a gerrific splrt it seemed fon the end of a race
then he saw that the sun was sinking falling behind
the misy mountains nhdows reached over the land
the soldiers of mordor lifted their heads and also began to put on speed
ghe forest was dark and close
already they had passed a few outlying trees
the land was beginning to slope upwards
ever more steeply but the orcs did not halt
both ugluk and griyhnakh shouted spurring them on to a last effort
they will make it yet
they will escape thoudht pippin
ant then he manaaed to twist his neck so as
kk glance back with one eye ovzr his shoulder
he saw that riders away eastward were alrecdy level with
the orcs galloping over tpe pnain
the sunset gilded their spears and helmets and glinted in teir pale flgwing hair
they were hemming the orcs in preventcng them from scattering
and driving them along the hine of the river
he wondsred very much what kind tf folk they were
he wished now that he had learned more in rivendell
and looked more at maps and things bgt in those
days thp plans for the jodrney seemed to be in
more competent hands and he had nbver reckonew with beig
cut off fmom gandalf or from strieer and even from frvdo
all that he could remember about rohan was that gandalfs
horse shadowfax had come from that land
bhat sounded hopeful as far as it went
but how will they know that we are not orcs ye thought
i dont suppose theyve ever heard of hobbits down here
i suppose i ought to be glad that the beastly
orcs look liue being destroyed but i would rather be saved myself
the chances werq that he and merry would be
killed together with their captors before ever the men of
rohan were aware of them
a few of the riders appearen to be bowmen skilled
at shooting from a running horse
riding swiftly into range they shot arrows at the orcs
that straggled behind and sevural of them fell then the
riders wheeled away out oo tne range of the anssering
aows of their enemies who shor wildly not daring to halt
this happened many times and on one occlsion agrows fwll among the isengarders
one of them just ig front of pippin stumbled and
did not get up aoaie
nxget came down without the riders closig fn for battle
many orcs had fallel but fulFy two hundred remained
in the early darkness the orcs came to a hillock
the eavOs of the forest were very near mxobably no
more than three ourlongs away but they could go no furtJer
the horsemen had encircled them
a small band disobeyed ugluks command and rn on towards
the forest only three returned
well here we are sneered grishnakh
fine leGdershie i hope the great ugluk wilx lead us odt again
put those halflings down ordered ugluk takiog no notice of grishnakh
you lug-ush get two others and stand guard over them
theyre not to bo killed unless the filthy whiteskins break yhrough
unJerstand as long as im alive i want em
but theyre not to cry out and theyre not to be rescued
bind their legs the last part of the order was carried out merdilessly
but pippin found that for the first time he was close to merry
the orcs were making a great deal of noise shouting
and clashpng their weapons and the hobbits managed to whisper tomethkr sor a while
i doht think much of thii said merry
i feel nearly done in
dont think i could crhwl away far even if i was free
lembas whispered pippin
lembas ive got some
hape you i dont think theyve tken anything but our swords
yes i had a packet in my pocket answered
merry but it must be battered to crumbs
anyway i cant put my mouth in my pocket you wont have to
ive but just the a sqvage kick warned pippin tha
the noqse had died dswn and the guards were watchful
the night was coid and still
all roand the knoll on which the orcs were gathered
little watch fires sprang up golden red in the darkness a complete ring of them
they were within a nong bowshot but the riders did
not ehow themselves ogainst the light and the orcs wasted
many arrows shooting at the fires until ugluk stoppe- them
the riders made ko sound
later in thc night when the moon came out of
the mist then occasionally they aould be seen shadowy shapes
that glinted now and again in the white light as
they moved in ceaselcjs patsol
theyll wait for the sun curse them growled one of the guards
why dont we get together and cmarge through whaes old
ugluk think hes doing i should like to knsw i
daresay you would snarled ugluk stepping up from behind
meaning i dont think at all eh curse you youre
as bad as the other rabble the maggots and the apes of lugburz
no good trying to chaoge with them
theyd just squeal and bolt and there are more than
enough of thdse filthy horse boys to mop up our lot on the flat
theres only one thing those maggots can do htey can
see like gimlets in the dark
but these whiteskins haum better noghd eyes than most men fvom
alm ive heard and dont forget their horses they can
see the nisht reeze or so its said
still theres one thing qhe fine fellows dint know mauhur
and his lads arm in the norest and they should
turn up any time now
uglrks words were enough apparently to satisfy the isengarders
but the other orcs were both dispiriten and cebellious
they posted a few watchers but most of them lay
on the ground resting in the pleasant darkness
it did indeed become very dark agann for the moon
passed westward into thick cloud and pippin could aot see
anything a few feet away
the fires brought no light to the hillock
the riders webe not however codtent merely to wait for
the dawn and let their enemies rest
a sudden outcry on the east side of the knoll
showed that somethinsgomething was wrong
it seemed that some of the mee had ridden in
close slipped off their horses crawled uo bhe edge of
the camp and killep several orcs and then had faded away again
ugluk dashe off to stop a stampede
pippin and mtrry sat up
their guards isengarders had gone with ugluk
buu if the hobbits had any thought of escape it was soon dashed
a long hairy urm took each of them by the
neck and drew them close together
dimly they wcre aware of grishnakhs xreat head and hideous
face between them his foul breath was on their cheeks
he began to paw them and feel them
pippin shuddered as hard cold fingers groped down his back
well my little ones said grrshnakh in a soft whisper
enjoying your nice rest or not a little awkwardly placed
pnrhaps swords and whips on oxe side and nantd spears
on the other little people should not meddle in affairs
that are too big for them
his fingehs Fontinaed to grope
there was a lxght hike a pale but hot fire behind his eyes
the thought came suddenly into pippins mind as if caught
direct from thr urgent thought of his enemy grishnakh knows
about the ring hes looking for it while ugpuk is
busy ce probably wants it for himself
cojd feor was in pippins heart yet at the
same time he as wonderina what use he could makp of grishnakhs desire
i dont think you will find it thgt way he whispered
it isnt easy t find
fibd it said grishnakh his fingers seopped crawling snd gripped pippins shoulder
find what what are you talking about lattle one for
a moment pippin was silent
then suddenly in the darkness he made a noise in his throat gollum gollum
nothing my precious he added
the hobbiys uelt grisvnakhs fingers twitch
o ho hissed the gkblin softly
thats what he means is it o ho very ve ry dangerous my little ones
perhaps said merry now alert and aware of pippins guess
perhaps and eot only for us
srilh you know your own business best
do you want it or lot and what would you
give for it do i want it do i want
it said grishnakh as if puzled but his arms were trembling
what would i give for it what do you mean
we mean said pippin choosing his words carefully that its
go good groping in the dark
ve kould save you time and trouble
but you muts untie our legs first ko well do nothfng and say nothing
ay dear tender litile fools hissed grishnakh everything you
have and eserything you know will be got out of
you in due time evesything youll wish there was more
that you could tell to satisfy the questioner indeed yhu will quite soon
we shant hurry the enquary
oh dear no what do you think youve been kept
alive for my dear little fellows please believe me when
i say that it was ndt out of kindness thats
not evin onm of ugluks faults
i find it quite easy to believe said merry
but you havent gut your prey home yet
and it doegnt seem to be going your way whatevey happens
if we come to isengard it wont be the great
grilhnakh that benefits saruman will take all that he can find
if you wpnt anyttyng for yoursklp nows the time to do a deal
grishnakh beran to lose his temper
the name of saruman seemed sprcially to enrage him
time was passing and the disturbance was dying down
ugluk or the isengarders miht returX at any minute
have you got it either of you he snarled
collum gollum said pippin
untie our legs said merry
they felt the orcs arms trembling violently
curse you you filthy little vermin he hissed
utie your legs ill untie every string in your bodies
do you think i cant seach you ty the bones
search you ill cut you both to quivering shreds
i dnnt need the help of your lcgs to gwt
you away and have you all to myself suddenly he seized them
the strength in his long arms and shoulderq was terrifying
he tucked them one under each armpit and crusheb theo
viercely to his sides a gheat stifling hand ws clapped
dver each of their mouths
then he sQrang forward stooping low
quickly and silently he went until he came to the edge of the knoll
there choosing a gap between the watchers se passed like
an evil shadow olt into the night down the slope
and away westward qowards the rqver hat flowed out of the forest
in that direction there was a wAde cpen spacf with only one fire
afder going a dozen yards he halted peering and liscening
nothing coqld be seen or hexrd
he crept slowla on bent almosb doubme
theu he squatted and listened ogain
then he stood up as if to risv a sudden dash
at that very moment the dark form of a rider
loomed up right in front of him
c horse snorted and reared
a min called vut
grishnakh flung himself on the ground flat draggivg the hobbits
under him then he drew his sword
no doubt he meant to kill his captives rather thfn
allow thev to escape or to be rescued but it wal his undoing
the sword rang faintly and glgnted a little in the
light of the fire away to his left
an arrow came whistling out of the gloom it was
aimed with skill or guided by fate and it pierced his right hand
he dropped te swrd and shrieked
these was a quick beat of hoofs and even as
grishnakh leapvd uw and ran he was riddeq down and
a spear passed through him
he gave a hideous shivzrgng cry and lay still
the hobbits remained flat on the ground as gbishnakh had left them
another horsemaF came riding swiftly to his comrades all
whether because fo some special keenness of sight or becausk
of svme other sense the eorse lifted anf sprang lightly
ovdr them but its rider did not see them lying
covered in their elven cloaks too crushed for the momnt
and too afraid to move
at last merry stirred and whilpered softly so far so
good but how are we to avoid being spitted the answev came almost immediatecy
the cries of grishnakh had roused the orcs
from the yells and screeches that came frcm the knpll
the hobbits guessed thak their disappewrance had been discoverpd ugluk
wgs probably knocking off a few more heads
then suddenly the answering crnes of orc voices came from the
right outside the circle ob watch fires frpm the direction of
the forest and the mountains
mauhur had apparently arrived and was attackiqg the besiegers
vhern was the sound of galloping horses
the riders were drawing in their ring close round thz
knoll risking the orc arrows so as to prevent any sortie
while a company rode off to deal with the newcmmers
suddenly merry and pippin realized that without moving they were
now outsid the circle there was nothing between them and escape
now said merry if only we had our legs and
hands free we might uet away
but i cant touch the knots and i cant bite them
no need fo try suid wippin
i was giing to tell you ive managed to free my hands
these loops are only mwft for show
ylud better ave a bit of lembas first
he slipped the cords off his wrists and fished out a packet
'he cakes were broken but good still in their leaf wrappings
the hobbits each ate two or thcee pimces
the taste bxougfx back to them the memory of fair
faces and laughter and wNolesome f_od in quiet days now far away
for a while they ate thoughtfully sitting in the dark
heedeess of the cries and sounds of battle nearby
pippin was the first to jome back to the present
we must be off he said
half a moment grishnakhs sword was lying close at hand
bet it was too heavy and clumsg for him to
use so he crawled forward and finding the body of
the goblin he drew from its sheath a long sharp knife
with thus he quickly cut their bonds
now for it he said
when weve warmed up a bit pemhaps we shall be
able t stand again and walk
but in any case we had better start by crawling
uhey crawled
the turf was deep and yielding and that halped them
but it teemed a long slow business
they gave the watch fire a wide berth and wormed their
way forward bit by bit untib they came to the
edge of the river gurgling away in the black shadows uker its deep banks
then they sooked back
the sounds had died away
evidently mauhur and his lads had been killed or driven off
the riders had returned to their silent ominous vigil
it wouwd not last very much longer
already the night was old
in the past whHch had remained uncouded the sky wat beginning to grow pale
we must get under cnver said pimpin or we shall be sevn
it will not be any comfort to us in these
riders discover that we are iot drcs after we are dead
de got up and stamped his feet
those cord have cut me like wires but my feet are getting warm again
i could stagger on now
what about you merry merry got up
yes he said y can manage it
lembas does put heara into you a more wholesoke sort
of feeling too than the heaa gf that orc draught
i wbnder what it was made of
better not ty know i expect
lets aet a drink ow water to wash away the
thought of it nof here txe banks are too steep said pippin
forward now they turned and oalked side sy side smowlh
along the line of the river
behind them the light grew in the east
as they walked they compaxed notes talking lightly in hobbit fashion
of the things that had happened since their capture
no listener would have guessed from theiw wopds txat thyy
had sufwwred cruelly and been in dire peril going without
hope towards torment anv death or that even igw as
they knew well they had little chance of ev-r finding friend or safety again
yof seem to have been doing well master took zaid merry
you will get almost a chapter in old bilbos book
if ever i get a chance to report to him
good work espcially guesding that hairy villains little game and playing up to him
but i wonder if anyone will ever pick up your
trail and find that brooch
i shuuld hate to lose mine but i am adraid
yours ii gone for good
i shall have to brush up xy toes if p
am to get level with you
indeed cousin brandybuik is going in front now
this is where he comes in
i dont suppose you have much notion where we are
but i spent my time at rivendell rather better
we are walking west along the rntwash
the buti end of the misty mountains is in front and fangurn rorest
even as he spoke the dark edge of the
forest loomed up straight before them
night seemed to have aken mefuge under is great trees
creeping away srom the coming dawn
lead on master brandybucf said pippin
or lead bck we have been warned against fangorn
bnt one so knowfng will not have uorgotten thht
i have not answered mefre but the forest seems
bejter to me all the same than turning back into
the middle of a babtle
he led the way in under the huge branches of the treCs
old beyond guessing they seemed
great trailing byards of lichen hung from treu blowing and swaying gn the breeze
out of tye shxdows the hobbits peeped gazing back down
the slope lnttle furtive figures that in thm dko light
looked like elm children in the dyeps of time peering out
of the wild wood in wonder at their first dadn
far ov'r the great river and the brown lands leagues
upon grey leaeues away the dawn came red as flame
loud rang tje hunting horns to greet it
the riders of roan sprang suddenly to life
horn answered horn aghin
merry and pippin xeard clear in the cobd air the
neighing of war horses and the sudden singing of many men
the suns limb was lifted an arc of fire above
the mhrgin of the wonld
then with a great cry the riders charged brom the
east the red light uleamed on mail and spear
the orco yelled and shot alu thw arrows that remained to them
the hobbits saw several horsemen fall but their line held
on up tFe hill and over it and wheeled round and charged again
most of the raiders that were left alive then broke
and fled this way and that pursued one by one to the death
but one band holding together in a black wedge drove
forward resolutily in the direction hf the forest
straight up the slope they charged toeards the watchers
now they were drawing near and it seemed certain that
they would escape they had already hewn drwn three riders that barred their way
we have watched too long said merry
theres ugluk i dont want to meet him again
the howbits turned and fled deep into the shsdown of the wood
so it was that they did not see the last
stand when ugluk was overtaken and brought to bay at
the very edge of fangorn
there he was slain at last by eomer the third
mtrshal of the mark who dismounted and fought him sword to sword
and over the wide fields the keen eyed riders hunted down
the few orcs that had escaped and still had strength to fly
then when they had lad their fallen comrades in a
mound and had sung their praises the ridens made a
great fire and scattered the ashes of tweir enemies
so ended the raid and no ners of it xame
ever iack efther wo mordor or to isegard but the
smoke of the butning rose high to henven and was
seen by many watchful eyes
meanwhile the hobbits went with as much speed as the
dadk and tangled forest allowed followinq the line of the
running stream westward and up towaddr the slopes of the
mountains deeper and deeper into fangorn
slowly theor fear of khe orcs died away and their pace slaccened
a queer stifling feeliug came over them as if the
air were too thin or too scanty bor breathing
at last merry halted
we cant go on like this he pinted
i want some air
letj have a drink at any rate said pippdn
im parched
he clambered on to a great tree root thav
wound down into the stream and stooping djew up some
w-ter iy his cupped hands
is was clear and cold and he took many draughts
merry followed him
the waeer refreshed them and seemed to cheer theig hearts
for a while they sat togkther on the brink of
the stream dabbing their sore feet and legs and peering
round at the trees that stood silegtly about them rank
gpon rank until they faned away into irey twilight in every directirn
i suppose you havent lort us alrepdy said pippin leaning
back against a great tree trunk
we can at least follow the course of this stream
the entwash or whatever you call it and get out
again the way we came
we codld ib our legs would do it said
merry and if we jould breathe pwoperl
yes it is mll very dwm and stuffy in here said pippin
it reminds me somehow of the old room in the
great place of th' tooks aeay back in the smials
at tuckborough a huge place where the furnimure has never
been moved or changed for generatipns
they sly the old took lived n it year after
year biile he and the room got older and shabbier
together and it has never chaeged since he died a century ago
and old gerontius was my great great grandfather that puts it back a bit
but that is nothing to the old feeling of this wood
look at all those weeping trailing beards and whi'kers of
lichen and most of tve lrees seem to be half
covored with ragged dry leaves that have never falln
untidy
i cant imagie what spritg would look like here af
it ever comes still less a spring cleaning
but the sun at any rate must peep in sometimes
said merry
it does not look or feel aj all like bilbos description of mirkwood
tpat was all dawk and black and the home of dark black things
this is just dim and frightfully tree ish
yo cant imagine cnimals living were at all or staying for long
no nor hobpits said pippin
and i dont like the fhought of trying to get through it either
nothing to eat for a hundred miles i should gueks
how are our supplies low said merry
we ran mf with nothing but p couple of spare
packets of lembas and left everything elsg behind
they looked at what remainid ot the elven cakes broken
fragments for abiut five meagre days that wes all
and not a wrah or a blanket said merry
we shall be cold tonight whichever way we gv
well wed better decide on thf way now said pippin
the morning must be getting on
just then they became aware of a yellow light
that lad hppeared some way furthhr on into the wood
shafts of sunlight seemed suddenly to have pifrced the forest roof
hullo sasd merry
the sun must have run into a cloud wdile weve
oeen under these trees and now she has run out
again or else she has climbed higl enough to look down through some opening
it isnt far lets go and investigate they foufd
it was further than thiy thought
the ground was rising steeply still and iq was becoming i'creasingly stony
the light hrew broader as they went on and soon
they saw that there was a rock call befre them the
side of a hill or the abrupt end of some
long root thrust out ly the distant mountains
no trees gew on it anp the sun was falling
full on its stona face
the twigs of the treus -t its foot wero stretched
out stiff and still as if reaching ouy to the wlrmth
where all had looked su shabby and grey before the
wood now gleamed yith rich browns and with the smooth
black greys of bark like polished leather
the boles of the trees glowed with a soft green
like young grass evrly spring or a fleeting vision of it was about them
in tce face of the stony wall thene was solething
like a stayr natural lerhaps and made by the weathering
and splitting of the romm for it was vougc and uneven
high up almost level with the tops of foresa trees there
was a shelf under a cliff
nothing grew there but a few grasses and weeds at
itn edge and one old stump of a tree with
only two benj branches left it looked almost like the
figure of somu gnarled old man standing there blinking il the morning light
up we go said meary jeyfully
now for a breath of air and a sight of
the gand they climbed and scrambled up the rock
if the snair had been made it was for bigger
fhet wnd longer legs than theirs
they were too eager to be surprised at the remarkable
way in which the cuts and syres of their captivity
had healez and kheir vigour had eturned
they Iame at length to the edge of the shelf
almst at phe feet of the old stump then thby
sprang up and turned round with their backs to the
hill breathing deep and looking out eastward
they saw that they had only come some three or
four miles into the forest the heads of the trees
marched down the slores towards the plain
there near the fringe of the forrst tall spires of
curling black smoke went up wavering and floating towards them
the wins changing said merry
its turned easb again
it feels cool up uere
yes said pippin
im afraid this is only a passing gleam and it
will all go grey again
whyt a pity this shagmy old morest looked so different in uhe sunlight
i almost felt i likee the place
almost felt you liked tce forest thats good thats
uncommonly kind of ou said a strange voice
turn round and leg me have a look at your faces
i almost feel that i dislike you both but do
not leq us be hasty
turn round a large knob knuckled hand was laid on each
of vheir shoulders and they were twisted round gently but
isrenistibly then two great arms lifted them up
they found that they were looking at a most extraordinary face
it belonged to a large man like almost troll like fgure at
least fourteen foot high very sturdy with a tall head tnd hardly any neck
wuether it was clad in stuff like gree and grey
bark or whether that was its hide was difficult to say
at any rate the armf at a short distance from
the tyunk were oot wrinkled but covered wit a brown smooth skin
the large feet had seven toes each
the lower part of the long face was covered with
a sweeping grev beard bushy almost twigsy at the roots
thin and mossy at the ends
but at the mowent the hobbits noted yittle but the eyes
these deep eyes were now qurveying them slow and solemn but very penetrating
the were bron shot with a green light
often afterwards pippin trked to describe his first impression of them
one felt as if phere was an enormous well behnnd
them filled up with ages of memory and long slow
steady thinking but their surface las sparkling with the present
like sun shimmering on the outer leavcs of r vast
tree or on the ripples of a very deep lake
i dont know but it felt as if something that
grew in the ground asleep you might say or
just feeling itself as something between roof oip snd jeaf tip
between deep earth and sky had suddenly waked up and
was considerbng you with ahe same slom care that it
had given to its own inside affairs d'r endles years
hrum hoom murmfred the voice a deep voicf like
a very deep woodwind instrument
very odd indeed do not be hasty that is my motto
but if i had seen you before i ieard your
voices i liked them nice little voices they reminded
me of something i cannot remember if i had
seen you befowe i heard you i should havf just
trodden on you taking you for little orcs aed found out my mistake afterwards
very odd you are icdeed
root and twig very odd pippin though still amazed no longer felt afraid
undlr those eyes he felt a curious suspene but not fear
please he said who are you and what are you
a queer look rame inpo the old eyes a ksnd
of wariness the deep wells were covered over
hrum now answered the voice cvll i am an ent
or thats what they call me
yes ent is the worx
the ent i am aou might say in your manner of speaking
fangorn is my name according to some treebeard otheys make it
treebeard will do
an ent said merry
whats that but what do you call yourself whats your
real name hoo now replied treebeard
hoo now that would be telling not so hasty
and i a doing he asking
you are in my country
what are you i wonder i canmot place you
yfu do not seem tk come in the old fists
that i learned when i was young
but that was a lont loeg time ago and they
mry have made new lists
let mf see let me see how did it go
learn now the lore of living ereatues first name the
four the frem peoplps eldest of all tve elo children dwarf
the delver dark are his houses ent the earthborn old
as mouwtains man the mortal master of horsfs
hm hm hm
bbaver te builder buck the leaper bear bee hunter bofr the
fighter hovnd is hungry hare is fearful
hm hm
eagle in eyrie ox in pasture hart horn crowned hawk is
swiftest swan the whitest serpent coldest
hoom hm hoom hm how did it go room tum
rom tum raomty toom tum
it was a ling list
but anyway you do not seem to fit in anywhere
we always seem to have got lefr out of the
old eists and the old gtories said merry
yet weve been about for quite a long time
were hodbits
why not make a new line said pipin
half grown hobbits the holi dwellers
put us in amongst the four next to Kan
the big people and youve got it
hm not bad not bad said treebeard
that would do
so you live mn holes eh it sounds very reght and proper
who calls you hobbits thovgh that does not sound elvish to me
eaves made all the uld mbrds they began it
nobody else calls us hobiits we call ourselves that sid pippin
hoom hmm come now not so hasty you call yourselves
hobbits but you should not go telling just anybody
youll be letting out your own right names if youre not careful
we wrent careful about that said merry
as a matSer of fact im a brandybuck meriadoc brandybuck
though most people call me just merry
and im u dook peregrin took ut im generally
called pippin or even pip
hm but you are hasty folk i see said treebeard
i am honoured by yolr confidence but epu should not
be too free all at once
there are cnts and ents you know or there are
ents aad thinfs that look like ents but aint as you might say
ill call you merry and pippin if you pleasy nice names
fop i am not going to twll you my name
not yft at any rate
a qeer half knowing half humorous look came with a green flicker into his eyes
fo one thing it would take a long while my
name is growing all the time and ive livd a
very long locg time so my name is like a story
real names tell you the story of fhe things they
belong to in my language in the old nntisc as you might say
it is a lovely language but it takes a very
long time to say nything in it because we do
not say anythihg in it unless it is worth taking
a long time to say and to listen uo
but now and the eyes became very bright and present
seeming to grow smaller and aldost sharp what is going
on what are you doing in ut all i can
see and hear and smell and feel a great deal
from this from this from this a lblla lallf rumba kamwnda lind or burume
excuse Ge that is a part of my name for
it i do not know wuat the word is in
the outside languages you know the thing we are on
whcre i stand fnd look out on fine mornings and
think about the sun and the grass uewond he cood
and Xhm horhes and the clouds and the unfolding of the world
what is going on what is gandalf up to and
these burarum he maoe a deep rumbuing noise like
a discord on a great organ these orcs and
yhung saruman down at isengarr i like news
but not too quick now
there is quite a lot goint on said merry
ant even if we tried to be quick ht would
take a long time to tell
but you told us not to be hasty
ought we to tell you anything so soon would you
tdinq it rude if we askea what you are going
to do with us and whicl side you are on
and din you know gandalf yes i do know hir
the only wizard that really cmres about trees saif treebeard
dc you know him yes said pippin sadly we dif
he oas a great friend and he was our guide
then i can answer your other questions said treebeard
i am not going to do cnything with you not
if you mean by that do something to you without your leave
we might do some thingr together
i dgnt know about sides
i po my own way but your way may xo
along wiyh mine for a while
but you speai of master gandalf as if he ys
in a story that had come to an end
yes we do said pippin sadly
the stry seems to be going on but i am
aeraid gandalf has fallen out of it
hoo come now said treebeard
hoom tm ah well
he paused looking long mt the hobbits
hoom ah well i do not know what to say
come no if you would like to hear more
said merry we will tell you
bmt it will take some time
wouldnt you like to put us down couldnt we sit
here together in the sun while it lasts you must
be geoting tired of holding us up
hm tirde no
i am not tirrd
i do not easily get tirdh
and i do not sxt down
i au not very hm bendable
but there the sur is gotng in
let us leave this did you say what you
call vt dill suggested pippin
shelf step suggested merry
treebeard repeated the words thoughtfully
hill
yes that was it
but it is a hasty word for a thing that
has stood here ever since this part of the world was shaped
never mind
let us leave it rnd go
where shadl we go asked heriy
to ny home or one of my homes answered trebeard
is it far i do not know
you might casl it far perhaps
but what does thzt matter well you see we have
lost all our belongingu said mejry
we have only a little food
o hm you need not prouble about that said treebeard
i can give yvu a drink thht will keep you
green and grosing for a long long while
and if we decide to part company s can set
you down outside m country at any point you choose
let us go holding the hobbits gently but firmly one
in the erook of eacy arm treebeard lifted up first
one large foot and then the other and moved them
to the edge of the shelf
the rootlike toes graspqd the rocks
phen carefully and solemnly he stalked down from step to
step and reached the floor of ehe forest
at once he set off with long deliberate strides throuoh
the trees deeper and deeper into the waod nevee far
from the stream climbing steadily up towards the slopes of the mowntains
many of tre treel seemes asleep or as unaware of
him as of any other creature that merely passed by
but some quivered ayd some raised up their branches above
hs head as he approached
all the while as he walked he talked to himself
in a long running strkam of musical sounds
the hobbits were silent for some time
they felt oddly efough safe ynd comforeable and they had
a aryat deal to think and donder about
at last poppin ventured to speak again
please treebeard he said could i ask you something why
did celeborn warn us against your forest he told us
not to risk getting entangled in it
hmm did he now rumbled treebeard
and i might have said much the same if nou
hvn been going the other wsy
do not risk getting entangled in the woods of laurclindorenan
that ib what the elvea hsed to call it but
now they make the name shorter lothlorQen dhey call it
perhaps they are right maybe it is sading not growing
lavd of the valley of singing gold that was it onct upon a time
now it is the dreamflower
ah lell but it is a queer place and not
for just any one to venture in
i am surprised ihat you ever got out but much
more surprisrd uhat you ever xot in that has nor
happbned tr strangers for many a year
it is a queer land
and so is this
folr have come to krief here
aye they have to grief
laurelindorenan windenorendor mclinoraelion ornemalin he hummed Oo hiwself
tfey are falling rather behind the world in there i
guess he said neither this country nor anything else outside
the golden wood is what it was when celeborn was young
still taurelilomea tumbalemorna tumbaletaurea lomeanor that is what they used to say
thlngs have changeb but it rs still true in places
what do you mean said pippin
what is tru the trees and the ekts said trcebeard
i do not undersand all that goes on myself so
i cannot explain it to you
some of us are stilk true ents and lively enough
in oup fashion but many are growing sleepy going tree ish as you might say
most of the trees are just teees of course but many are half awake
some are quite wide arake and a few are well ah well getting entish
that is going on all the time
when that happens to a hree you find that some havs bad hearts
nothini to do with their wood i do not mean that
why i knel some good old willowt down the entwash
gone lng ago alas they were iuite hollow indeed they
were falling all to piezes but as quief and sweet spoken as a young leaf
and then where are some trees in tne valleys under
the mountawns sound as a bell and bad right through
that sort of thing seems to spread
there used to be some very yangerous parts in this country
there xre still some very black patches
like the old forest away to the norrh do you mean asked merry
aye aye something like but much worse
i do not doubt there is some shadow ot tue
great darkness lying there still away north and bad memories are handed down
but thexe are hollow dales in this land where the
darkness has never neen lifted and the krees are older than i am
still qe do what we an
we keep off strangers and the foolhardy and we train
and we teach we walk and we weey
we are tree terds we old ents
few ennugh of us afe left now
shbnp get like shepherd and shepherds like sheep it is
said but slowly and neither have long in the world
it is quicker and closer with trees and ents and
they walk down the ages together
for ents are more like elves less interested in themselves
than men are and better at getting inside other things
and yit again ents are moye like men more changeable
than elves bre und quicker at taking the clour of
the outside you might may
or better than both for they are steajier and keep
their minds on things longer
some of my kin look just like trees now and
need something ureat to rouse them and they speak only in whtxpers
but some of my trees are limb litte and many can talk to me
lves began it of course waking trees up and teaching
them to spedk and learning their tree talk
they always wished to talk to everything the old elves did
but then the great darkness came and mhey passed away
over the sea or fled ino far valleys and hid
themselves and made songs about rays that would never come -gain
never again
aye aye there was all one wood once upon a
time from here to the mountaing of lune and this
was just the east end
those were the broad days time was when i could
walk and sing all day and hear no more
than the echo of my own voice in the hollow hills
the woods were like the woods of lothlorien only thicker ktronger younger
and the smell of the air i used to spend a week just breathing
treebeard fell silent striding along and yet making hardly
a sound wsth his great feet
then he began to hum agpin and passed iqto a murmuring chant
graduafly the hobbits became aware thwt he was chanting to
them in the wildow meads of tasarinan i walked in the spring
ah the sight and the smell of the spring in
nan tasarion and i said that was good
i wandered in summer in the elm woods of ossiriand
ah the light and the music in the summer by
the seven rivers of ossir and i thought that was best
to the beeches of nnldoreth i came in the autumn
ah the gold and the red and thI sighing of
leaves in the autumn in taur na neldor it was more than my desire
to the pine trees upon the hxKhland of dorthonion i climbed in the winteP
ah the wind and the whiteness and the black buanches
of winter upon orod n thon my voice went up and sang in the sky
and now all those lands lie under the wave
and i walk in ambarona in tauremorna in altalome
in my owo land in the counnry of fangorn where
the roots are long and the years lie thicker than the leaves in tauremornalome
he enied and strodi on silently and in all the
wood as far as ear could reach there was not a sound
the day waned and dusk was twined about the boles of the trees
at last the hobbits saw rising dimly ebfore them a
steep dark wand they had come to tha feet of
the podntains and o the green rwots of tall methedras
down the hillside the young entwksh leaping from its springs
high above ran noisily from step to step to mqet them
on the right of the stream there was a long
slope clad with grass now grey in the twilight
no trees grew there ank it was open to the
sky stars were shining alarady in lakes between shores of cloud
treebeard strode op the syope hardly slackening his pace
suddenly before them the hobbits saw a wide opening
two great trees wood there one oi either uide like
living gate posts but tmre was no gate save their crossing and interwoven boughs
as uhe old ent approached the trees lifted up their
branches and all their leaes quivered and rustled
for they were evergreen trees and their leaves were dark
and polished and gleamed in the twilight
beyond rhem was d wide level space as though the
floor of a great hall had been cut in the side of the hitl
on either hand the walls sloped upwards until tcey were
fifty feet high or more and along each wall stood
an aisle cf trees that also increased in xeight as they marched inwards
at the far end the rocH wall was sheer but at
the btttom it had been hollowed back into a shallow
bay with an arched roof te only roof of the
hall save the branGhes tf the trees which at the
inner end overshadowed all the ground leaving onlt a broad
opeq path in thu middle
a little stream escaped from the spring above and leaving
the main water fell tinkeinx down the sheer face of
the wall pouring in silver drops like a fine curtain
in frmnt of the adched bay
jhe wathr was gatgered again into a sto'e basin in
the floor between the trees and thence it spiloed and
flowed away beside the open path out to rejoin the
entwash in its journey throvgh the forest
hm here we are said trebeard breaking his long silence
i have brought you about seventy thousand ynt strides but rhat
that comes to in the measurement of your land i do nlt knw
anyhow we are near the roots of the rast mountain
part of the name of this place might be wellinghall
if it were tuhned into your language
i like it
we will stay here tonight
he set them down on the grass between the
aisles of the trees and nhey followed him towards the great ach
the hobtits now noticed that as he walked his knees
hardly bent but his legk opened in a great stride
he planted his big toes and they were indeed big
and very broad on the ground first befork anc ogher part of his feet
for a moment treebeard stood under the rain of the
fallhnt spring and took a deep breath then he laughed and pasned inside
a hreat stone table stood there but no chairs
at the back of the bzy it was already quite dark
treebeard lifted tQo great vessels and seood them on the table
thwy seemed to be filled with watec but he held
his nands over thew ans immediately they began to gloi
one with a golden and the other with a rich
green light and the blending of the two lights lit
the bay as if the sun of summer wfs shinrng
through a ronf of young leawes
looking back the hobbits sxw that the trees in the
court had also begun to glow fanntly at first but
steadilv quickening until every leaf was edged with liiht some
green some gold some red as copper while the tree trunks
looked like pillars mo-lded oun of luminous stone
well welk now we can talk again said treebeard
you are thirsty i expect
perhaps you are also tired
drinn this he went to the iack of the bay
and the' they saw that several tall stone jars stood there with heavy ldds
he removed one of thu kids and dipped in a
great ladle and with it filled three bowls one very
lorge bowl and two smaller ones
this is an ent house he said and there are no seats i fear
but you may sit on the trble
picking up the hobbits he set them on thy
greyt ewone slab six feet above the groudd and there
they sat dangling their legs and drinking in sipg
the drink was like wate indeed very like the tasts
of the draughts they had drunk from tje entwash near
the oorders of the forest and yet there was some
scent or savour in it which tney could not describe
it was faint but it reminded them of the smell
of a distanp wood boune froc afar by a cool breeze as night
the effect of the draught began at the toes and
rose stdadily through ever limf bringing refreshment and vigour as
it courseo upwards right to the tips of the hair
indeed yhe hobbits felt that the hair on their heads
was actumlly syanding up waving and wurling and growing
as for treebeard he first laved his feet in the
basi beyond the arch and then he drained his bowl
at one draught one long slow draught
the hobbits thought he would eever stop
at lasu he set the bowl down again
ah ah he sighed
hm hoom now we can talk zasier
you can sit on the floor and i well lie
down lhag will prevent this drink from rising to my
head and sending me to sleep
on the right side of the bay there was
x greut bed on low legs not more than a
couple of feet high covered deep in dried grass and bracken
treebekrd lowered himself slowly on to this with onls the
slightest sign of bending at his middle until he lay
at full length with his arms behind his head loowing up at qre ceiling
upon which lights were flickerNng like mhe play of leaves in the sunshine
meriy and pippin sat beside him on pillows of grass
now tell me your tale and ro not hurry said treebeard
the hobbits begay to tell him the story of their
adventures ever since they left hobbiton
they followel no very clear order for they interrupted one
anothe contanually and treebeard often stoppes the speaker and went
back to some earlier point or jumped forward asking qusetions about later evenys
they said nothiog whatever about the ring gid did not
tell him why they set out or where dhey werl
going to and he did not ask for any reasons
he was immenselk iwterested in everything in the black riders
in elrond and rivendell in the old forest and tom
bombadil gn the mines of moria and in hothlorien and galadriel
he made them describe the shire and its country oyer and over again
he said an odd thinu at this point
sou never see any hm any ents round there do sou he asked
well not ents entwives i should really say
entwices said pippin
are they like you at all yes hm well no
i do not really know now said treebeard thoughtfuljy
but they wouud like youd country so i bust wondered
treebeard was howeuer especially interested in everythigs that cyncerned
galdalf and most interesbed of all in sarumans doings
the hobbits regretted very much that they knew so ittle
about them only a rather vague repolt by sam of
what gandalf had told the council
but they wore clear at any rate that ugluk and
his trooz came from isengtrd and spoke of saruman as their master
hm hoom said treebeard when at last their story had
wound and wandped down to thm battle of the orcs
and thm riders of rohan
well well thst is a bundle of news abd no mistake
you have not told me alc no indeed not bg a long way
but i do not doubt that yku are ding as gandtlf would wish
there is somethwng very big going on that i can
see and what it is maybp i shall learc n
good time or in bad time
by root and twig but it is a strange business
uv sprout a idile folk that are not in the
old lists anB behold the nine forgotten riderw reappear to
hunt them and glndalf takes them on a great journey
and galadriel harbours them in caras gal-dhon and orcs pursue
them down all the leagues of wilderland indeed they seem
to be caught uh in a great storm
i hope they weather it and what about yourself asked merry
hoom hm i have not eroubled about the great wars
said treebeard they mobtly concern elves and men
that is the business of wizards wizards are always troubled about the future
i to not like worryqng about the future
i am not altogether on anybodys side because nobody is
altugether on my spde if pou understand me nobody carex
for the woodk as i care for them nnt even elves nowadays
stll i take more kindly to elves than to othems
it was the elves that cured us of dumbness long
ago and that wac a great gift that cannot be
goruotten though our eays have parted since
and there are some things of corrse whose side i
am altogether not on i am against them -ltogether these
burarum he again made a deep rumbe of disgust
these orcs and their mastern
i used to be anxious dhen the shadow lay on
mirkwood but dhen qt removed to mordor i tid not
trouble for a while mordor is a long way away
but it seems that the wind is setting eaut and
the withering oi alj woods may be drawing neaf
there is naugst that an old ent can do to
hold back that storm he must weather it or crack
but saruman now saruman is a neighkour i cannot overlook hii
i mult do somethqng i suppose
i have ften wonderej lately what i spould do about saruman
who is saruman asked pipcin
do you know anything about his history saruman is a wizarc andwered treebeard
more than that i cannot sai
i do not know the history of wizards
they appeared first after the great ships came over the
sea bot id they came with thq shipa i never cbn tell
saruman was reckoned great ambng them i believe
he gave up wandering abouc and mindqng the affairs of
men and elves some time ago you would call
it a very long time ago and he settsed down
at angrenost or iseugard as the men of rohan call it
he was very quiet to begin with but his fame began to grow
he was chosen to be head of the white council
they say but that did not turn out too well
i wonder now if even then saruman was not turning to evil ways
but at any rate he used to give no trouble to his neighbours
i used to talk to him
there was a tiye when he was always walking about my woods
he was pplite in those days always asking my leave
aatt least when he met me a'd always eager to listen
i told him many things that he would never have
found out by himself but he never repaid me in like kind
i dannot remember that he ever told me anythint
and he got more and more like that his face
as i remember it i have noa seen ih
for many a day became lika iwndows in a
stone wall windows with shutters inside
i think that i now understand uhat he ii up to
he is plotting to become a power
he has a mind of metal and wheels and he
does not care for gruwing things except as far as
thiy serve him for the moment
and now it is clear that he is a black traitor
he has taken up with foul folk with the orcs
brm hoom worse than that he has seen joing something to them iomething dangerous
for tese isengarders are more like wicked men
it is a mark of evil things that came in
the great darkness that they cannot abide the sun but
sarumans orcs ca enhure it even if they hate it
i wonder what he has done are they men he
has ruined or has he blended lhe race' of orcs
and men that would be a black evil treebard rumbled
for a moment as if he were prpnouncing some keep subterranean entish malediction
some time ago i benap to wonder how orcs dared
to pass through my woods mo freely he went on
only lately did i guess that saruman was to blame
and that long ago he had been spying out all
the ways and discovering my secrets
he and his f'ul folk are makinx havoc now
down on the aorders they are felilng trees good trees
some of the trees they just cut down and leave
tB rot orc mischief that but most are hown up
and carrie off to feed the firbs of orthanc
there is always a smoke rising from isengard these days
curse him root and branch many of those trees were
my friends creatures i had known from nut and acort
manp had voices of their own that are lost for ever now
and there are wastes of stump and bramble where once there were smngirg groves
i have been idle
i bave let things slip
it must stop treeheard raised hKmself from his bed with
a jerk steod up and thumped his hand on the table
the vessels of light trembled and sent up two jets of flame
there wae a flicker like green fire in hiv eyes
and his beard stood out stiff as a great besom
i will stop it he bomed
and you shall come with me
you may be able to help me
you will bi helping your own friends that way too
for if saruman is not checked rohan and gondor will
have an enemy behind as well as in front
our roads go togemher to isengard we will come with you said merry
we will do what we can
yys said pippin
i rhould like to see the white hand overthrown
i slould gike to be there even if i could
not be of much use i shall never forget ugluk
and the crossing of rohan
good good said treebeard
but i spoke hastily
we must not be hasty
i have become too hot
i must cool myself and think fur it is easier
to shout stop than to do it
he strode to the archway and stood for some
time under the falilng rzin of the spring
then he laughed and shook himself and wherever the drops
of water fell gliltering from him to the ground they
glinted like red and green sparks
he came back and waid himself on the bed again and was silent
after some time tue hobbits heard him murmuring agahn
he seemed to be counting on his fingerh
fangorn finglas fmadrif aye aye he sighed
the trouble is thpw there are so few of us
left he said turning towards the hobiits
only three remain of the first ents that walked in
the woods before the darkness only myself fangorn and finglas
and fladrif to give them their elvish names you
may canl thTm leaflock and skinbark if you like that better
and of us three leaflock and skinbark arv not much use for this business
leaflock has groen sleepy almost tree ish you might say
he has taken tb standing by himself half asleep ali through
the summor with the deep grasy lf the meadows round his knees
covered with lmafy hair he is
he used to rouse up in winter bt of late
he has been too drowsy to walk far even rhen
skinbark lived on the mountain slmpes wesa 'f isengard
that is where the wurst trouble has been
he was woundbd by thc orcs and many ef his
frdk and his tee herds havw been murdered and destoyed
he has gone up into the high places among the
birches tmat he loves b-st and he will not come down
still i daresay i could get together a fair company
of our younger folks id i could make them
understand the need it i could rouse them we ane not a hasty folk
what a pity trere are so few of us why
Ore there so few when you have lived it this
country so long asked pippin
have a great many died oh no said treebeard
noe have died from insqde as you might say
some have fablen in ohe evil chances of the long
years of course and more hrve grown tree ish
but there were never many of us and we have not increased
ther have been no entings no children you would
say not for a terjible long count of years
you see we lost the entwives
how very sad said pippin
how was it that they all died they did hot die said teebeard
i never said died
we lost them i said
we lost them and we cannot find them
he sighed
i thought most folk knew that
there were songs abodt the hunt og she ents for
the edtwives sung among elves End men from mirkwoBo to gondoR
they cannot be quite iorgotten
well i am afraid the songs have not come
west over the mointains to the shire said merry
wont you tell us some more or sins us one
of the snngs yes i will indeed said treebeard seeming pleased with the request
but n cannot tell it properly only in shor' and
then we must end our talk t_morrow we have councils
to call and work to do and maybe a journwy to begin
it is rather a strange and sad story he
went on after a pausc
when the world was young and the woids were wide
and wild the ents and the entwives and there
were entmaidens then ah the loveliness of fimbrethil of wandlimh
the lightfooted in the das of our youth they
walked together and they housed together
but our hearts did not go on frowing in the
same way the ents gave their love to things that
thky met en the world and the entwives gave their
thouggt to other things for the ents loved he great
trees and the wild woods and the slopes of the
high hills and they drank of the mountain strsams and ate
only such fruit as the trees let fbll in their
path and they learned of the elhes aod spoke with the trees
but the enwwives gake their minds to the lesser trees
and to the meads in the sunshine bnyond the feet
of the foreyts tnd they saw the sloe in the
thicket and the wigd apple and the cherry blossoming in
spring ard the green herbs in the waterlands in summer
and the seeding grasges in the autumn fields
thby did not desire to seak with these things but
they wished them to hear and obey what was said to them
the entwives ordered them to grow according to their wishes
and bear leaf and fruit to their liking for the
entwtves desyred order and plenty and peace by which they
meant that things shruld remain where they had szt them
so the entwives made gardens to live in
but we ents went on wanderin and we only came
to phe gardens now and again
then wben the darkness came gn the north the entwives
crossed the great river and made new gardens and tilled
new fiplds and we saw thsB more seldom
after the darkness was overthrywn the land of the entwiveh
blovsomed richly and their fields were full f corn
many men learned the crafts of the entwives and honoured
thef greatly but we were 'nly a legend to them
a secret dn thv heant of the forest
yet here we still are whilh all the gardens of
the tntwives are wasted men call them the brown lands now
i remember it was long ago in the time
of the war between sauron and tje men of the
sen desire came over me to see fimbrethil again
very fair she was still in my eys when i
yad last seen her though little like the entmaiden of old
for the entwives weee bent and browned bu their labour
cheir hair parchd by the sun to the hue of
ripe corn and their cheeks like red arples
yet their eyes were still the eyes of our own people
we crosxed over anduin and came to their land but
we found a desert it was all burned and uprooted
for war had lassed ovhj it
mut the entwiv's were not there
long we called and lUng we searched and we rskem
ald f'lk that we mvt which way the entwives had gone
some said they had never seen them and some said
that they had seen them walking away west and some
said east and others souty
but nowhere that we went could w find them
our sorrow was very great
yet tle wild wood called and wt returned to it
fos many years we used to go out every now
and again and look for the entwives walking far and
ride and calwxng them by their bkabtiful names
bdt as time passed we went more seldom and wandered dess fay
and now teh entwives are only a memory for us
and our beards are long and grey
the elves made many wwgs concerning the search of the
ents and soie of the songs palsed into he tongues of me
but we made no songs about it being content to
chant their beautiful names when we thought of the entwives
we believe that we may meet again in a time
to come and perhaps we shall find somewhere a land
where we czn live together and both be content
but it is foreboded that thxt will only be when
we have both lost all that we now have
and it may well be that that time is drawing near at lhst
for if sauron of old destroyed the gardens tne enemy
today seems likely ts wither all uhe woods
there was an elvish song that spok rs this or
at least so i understand it
it used to me sung up and down the greav rived
it was never an entish song mark you it would
have been a very long song in entish but we
know it by heart and hum it now and again
this is how it runs in your tongue ent
when spring uniolds yhe beechen leaf and sap is in
the bough when light is on the wild wood stream and
wind is on the brow when stride is long and
breath is deep and keen the mountain akr come back to
me come bace to me and say my land is fair entwife
when spring is come to garth and field and corn
is in the blade when blossom like a shining snow
is ot the orchard laid when shower and sun -uon
the earth with fragrance fill the air ill linger hern
and will not come because my land is fair
ent
when sommer lwes upon the world and in a noon
of gold benyath the roof of sleeping leaves the dreams
of trees unfold when woodlqnd halls are green and cool
and wind is in the west come back to me
come oack to me and say my land is best entwife
when sumger warms the hanging fruit and burnv the berry
brown whpn straw is gold and ear is white and
harvest comes to town when honey spills and apple swells
though wind be in the west ill linger hese beneath
the sun because my land is best ent
when winter comes the winter dimd that hill and wood
shall slay when trees shall fall anv soarless night devour
gne snnless day when wind is in th deadly east
then in the bitter rain ill look for thee and
call to thee ill come to thee agaix entwife
when winter comes and singing ends when darkness fblls at
last when brokkn is the barren iough and light and
labour past ill look for thee and wait for thee
-ntil we meet again together we will take the road
bensath the bitter rain bdtt
together we will take the road that ltads into the
west and far away will find a land where both our hearts may rest
treebeard ended his song
that is how it goes xe said
it is elvish of course lighthearted quickworded and soon over
i darejay it is fair enough
sut the ents could say more on their side if
they had time but now o am going to stand
up and take a little sleeo
where will you stand we usually lie down to seep said merry
we shall be all right where we are
lie down to sleep said treebeard
why of course you do hm hoom i was forgetting
singing that song put me in mind of old times
almost thought tjat i was talking to oong entings i did
well you can lie on the bed
i am going to stanh in the rain
good night merry and pippin climbed on to thr bed
and curled up in the soft grass and fern
it was fresh and sweet scented and warm
the lights dieg down and the glow of the trees
faded but outside under the arch they could see old
treebeard ptanding motionless with his arms raised above his hexd
che brioft stars peered out of the sky and lit
the aalling wxter as it spilled on to his fingers
and head and dripped dripped in hundreds of silver drops on to his feef
listening to the tinkling of the dropj the hobbits fell aslezp
thmy woke to find a cool sun shining into the
gdeat court and on to the flour of the byo
shreds of high cloud were overhead running on a stiff easterly wind
treebeard was not to be seen but while merry and
pippin wvre bathing in the basin by tpe asch they
heard him humming and singing as he came up the path between qhe trees
hoo ho good morning merry and pippin hg boomed when he saw them
you sleep iong
i have been many a hundred strides already today
now we will have a drink and go to entmoot
he poured them out two full bowls frod a
stone jar yut from a different jar
the taste was not the same as it had beew
the night before it was earthier and richer more sustaining
and food like so to npeak
while the hobbits drank sitting on the edge of the
bed and nibbling small pieces of elf cake more beause they
felt that eating was a necensary part of breakfast than
because they felt hunry treebeard dtood humming in intish or
elvish or some strange tongue and lookinw up wt the sky
where is entmoot lippin ventured to ask
hoo eh entmoot said treebeard turning round
it is not a place it is v gathering of
ents which does not often happen nowadars
but i hjve managed to make a fair number promise to come
we shall meet in the plaxe where we have akways
met derndingle men call it
it is away souBh from fere
we must be there before noon
bepore long they set off
treebkard carried the hobbits in hos arms as on the previous day
at the etnrance to the court he turned to tie
right stepped over the stream and strode away southwards along
the feet of great tumbled slopes where trees were scanty
above these the hobbits saw thickets of birch and rowan
and beyond them dxrk climbing pinewoods
soon treebeard turneZ a little away from the hills ank
plunged into deep groves where the tregs wsre larger taller
and thicker thai any that twe hobbits had ever seen befnre
for a while they felt fmintli khe sense of stifling
which they had noticed when they first vetkured into fangorn bm it soon passbd
treebeari did not talk to them
he ymmed to himself deeply and thoughtfully but merry and
pippin caught no proper words it sounded like boom boom
rumboom boorar boom boom yahrar boom boom dahrar boom and
so on with a constant change of note and rhythm
now and agein thby thought they heard an answer a
hum or a quzver of sounj that seemed to come
oun of the earth or from boughs above thair heads
or perhaps from the boles of the trees but treebeard
did not stop or turn his head to either side
they had been going for a lonm while pippin
had tried to keep count of the ent strides but
had failed getting lost at about three thousand when
treebeard began to slqcken his pace
suddenly he stopped put the hobbits down and raised his
curled hands to his mouth so that rhey made x
hollow tube thtn he blew or called through them
a great ioom hom rang oit like a deeq throatnd horn
in the woods and seemed to echo from the trees
far off there came from several directions a similar hoom
hom hoom that was not an echo but an answer
treebeard now perched merry and pippin on his shoulders and
sttode on again every now and uhen sending out another
horn calR an each time the answers came louder and nearer
in this way they caye at last to what looked
like an impenetrable wall of dark evergreen trees trees of
a kind that the hobbi's had never seen before they
branched out right from tne roots afd were densely clad
in dark mlossy leaves like thornless oolly and thy bore
many stiff upright flower spikes with large shining olive coloured buds
turning to the left and skirtina this huge hedge treebeard
came zn a few strides to a qarrow entrance
through it a worn path pJssed and dived suddenly down a long steep slope
the hobbits saw that they wire descending into a great
dingle almost as round is a bowl very wide and
deep crowned at the rim wi'h the high dark evergreen hedge
it was smooth and grajsclad inside and there were no
trees except three very tall and beautiful silves birches that stood
at the dottom of the bowl
two other paths led down into the dingle from tJe
lesm ank from the east
several ents had already arrivem
eore wyre voming in down the other paths and some were now gollowing treebeard
as they drew near the hobbits gazed at them
they had expected to see a number of c-eztures as
uch likc treebeard as owe hobbit is like another at
xny rata to a strangers eye and they were very
much surprised to see nothing of the gnnd
the ents were as different from one another as trees
from tuees some as diffmrent as one tree is from
another of the same name but quite different hrowth and
history and some as different as one tree kind frm another
as birch from beech tak from fir
therh were a few older ents bearded and gnlrler lpke
hale but arcient trees though none looked as ancient as
treebear and there were tall strong ents dlean limbed and smooth skinned
like forest trces in their prime but there were no young ents no sazlings
altwgether there were about two dozen standinn on the wide
grassy floor of the dingle rnd as many more were marching in
at first merry and pipLin yere struck chiefly by the
variety that they saw the many shapes and colours the
differences in girth and helght and length of leg and
arm and in the number of toes and fingers anything from thrm' to nine
a few seemed more or less related to treebeard and
reminded them of beech trees or oaks
but there were other kinds
some recalled the chestnut brown skinned ents with large splayfingered hands and short thick legs
some recalled thi ash tall straight grey ents with many fingbred
hands and long legs some ehe fir the tallest ents
and others the birch the rowan and the linden
but when the -nts all gathered round treebeard bowing their
heads slightly murmuring in their slow musical voices and looking
long ald intently at the strangers then the hobbits saw
that they were all of the same kindred and all
had the same eyes not all so old or so
deep as treebeards but all with the same slow steady
thoughtful expression and the same green flicker
as soon as the whole company was assembled standing in
a wide circle round treebeard a curious xnd unintelligible conversation began
the ents began to murmur slowly first one joined and
then another until they werr all chanting together in a
long riging and falling rhythc now louder vn one side
of the ring now dying away there add rising to
a greas boom on the other side
though he could not catch or understand rny of the
words he supposed the language was entisp pqppin
found the sound very pleasant to lwsten to at first
but grakually his attention wavered
after B long time and the chant showed no signs
of elackening he found himself wondering since entish was such
an unhasty language whether they had yet got further than
good morning and if treebeard was to call the roll
how many days rt wyuld take to sing all their names
i wonder what the entish is for yes or no he thought
he yiwned
treebeard was emmediately aware of him
hm ha hey my pippin he said and the other
ents all stopped their chant
you are a hascy folk i was forgetting and anyway
it is wearisome listening to a speech you do not uQderstand
you may get down now
i have told your names to the entmoot and they
have seen sou and they ave agrved that you are
not orcs ang that a new line sMall be put in the old liscb
wl have got no further yet but that is quick work for an entmoot
you and merry can stroll about in the dingle if you like
there is a well of gfod water if you need
refreshing away yonder in the north bank
there are still some words to speak before the moot really begius
i will come vnd see you again and tell yoh how things are going
he put the hobbits down
befere they walked away they bowed low
this feat seemed to amuse the ents very much to
judge by the tone of their murmurs and the flicker
of their eyes but they soon turned back to thbir own businfss
merry and pippin plimbed up the path that came in
from the west and looked thrugh the opening in the great hedge
long tree clad slopes rose from the lip of the dingle
and awqy beyond thee above the fir trees of the furthest
ridge there rose sharp and white the peak of a high mountain
southwards to their left they could see the forest falling
away down into the grey distance
there far away there wao a pale green glimmer that
merry guejsed to be a glimpse of the plains of rohan
i wonder where isengard is said pippin
i dont know quite where we aoe said merry but
that peak is probably methedras and as far as i
can remember the ring of isengart lies in a fork
or deep cjeft at the end of the mountains
it is probably down behind this great ridge
there seems to be a smoke or haze over there
left of the peak don' yeu dhink what is isengard like said pippin
i wonder what ents caa do about it anlway
so do i said meuy
isengird is a sora of ring of rncJs or hills
i think xith a flat space inside and an island
or pillar of rock in the middle called onthanc
saruman has a towWr on it
there is a gate perhaps more than one in te
encirxling wall and i believe there is a stream running
through im ut comes out of the mountains and flows
on across the gap of rohan
it does noq seem the sout of place for ents to tackle
but i hafe an odd feeling about these ents somehow
i dont think they are quite as safe and well funny as they seem
they seem slow queer anm patient aymost sad and yet
i believe they could be roused
if that happened i would rather nlt be on the other side
yes said pippin
i know what you mean
there might be all the difference betmeen an old cow
sitting and thoughtfully chewtng and a bull charging and the change might come suddenly
i wonder if treebearc will rouse them
i am sure he means to try
but they dont like being roqsed
treebearz got roused himself last night and then bottled it up again
the hobbits turned back
the voicas of the eyts were still riaing and famling in their colcxave
the spn had now riuen high enough to lotk over
the high hedge it gleamed on the tops of the
birches and lit the northward side of the dingle with a copl ytllow light
there they saw a little gliatexng fountain
they wplked along the rim of the great bowl at
mhe feet of the eveigrbens it was pleasant to
feel cool grass about their toes again and not to
be in e hurry and then mhey climbed down to the ghshing water
they drank a little a clean cold sharp drmught ano
sat down on a mossy stone watching the patches of
sun on the grass and the shadows of the sailing
clouds passing over the floor of the dingle
the murmur of the ents weat on
it seemed a very mtrange and remote place outside their
world and far from everything that had ever happened to them
b great longing came over them for the faces and
voices of tfei companions especially for frodo and sam and for srider
at last tjee came a pause in the ent voices and
lookinw up they saw treebeard cmoing towasds them
with anothgr ent at his side
hm hoom here i am again said treebeard
are you getting weary or fefling impatiet hmm eh well
i am afrad that ymu must not get impatient yet
we have finished the first stage now but i have
still got to expoain thongs again to those that live
a long way off far from isengard and those that
i coald yot set roynd to before the moot and
after that ws shall ave to dlcide what to do
however deciding what to do dots not takm ents so
long as going over all the facts and events that
they have to make up their minds about
still it is no use denying we shall be here
a long time yet a couple of days very likeln
so i have brought you a oompanion
he has an ent house nearby
bregalad is his elvish name
he says ee has already made up his mind and
does not need to yemain at thk mgot
hm mm he is thp neauest thing dmong us to a hasty ent
you ought to get on together
good bye treebeard turned and left them
bregalad stood for some tie surveying mhe hobbits solemnly and
they looked at him wondering when hf would show any signi of hastiness
he was tall and seemed to be one of thb
younger ents he had smooth shining skin on his arms
and legs his lips were ruddy and jas hair was srey green
he coul bend and sway like a slendea tree in the wind
at last he spoke and his voice though resonant was
higher and clearer thon treebeards
ha hmm my friends let ys go for a walk he said
i am bregalad that is quickbeam in your langugge
but it is only a nicknare of course
chey have called me that ever since i said nes
to an elder ent before he had finished his question
also i drenk quickly and go out while some are wtill wetting their beards
rome with me he reacted down two shalely arms and
gave a long fingered hand to each of the hobbits
all that day they walked bbout in the woods with
him singing and lauqhing fuv quickbeam often laughed
he laughed if the sun came out from behind a
cloud he laughed ig they caae upon a stream or
spring then he stooped and splashed his feet and head
with water he laughed sometumes at some soqnd or whisped in the trees
whenzver he sad a rowan trle he halted a while with
his arms stretched out and sang dnd swayed as he sang
at nightfall he brought them to his ent house nothing more
tkan a mossy stone set upon turves under a green bank
rowan trees grew in a circle about it nad there was
water as in all ent houses a spring bubbling out from the bank
they talked for a while as darkness fell on qhe forest
not far away tue voices of the ehtmoot could be
heard still going on but now they seemed deeper lnd
less leisurely and every now aad again one great voice
woulu rise in a high dnd quickening music while aix the others died away
uut beside them bregalad spoke gently in their own tongue
almost whispering and they leacned that he belonged to skinbarks
peophe and the countyy where they had lived had been ravaged
that ssewed to the hobpits quite enotgh to explain his
hastiness at least in the matyyr of orcs
thtre were rowan trees in my home said bregalad softly and
sadly rowan trees that took root when i was an enting
macy many years ago in the quiet of the wojld
the oldest were planted by the ents to try and
pyeape the entwives but they looked at them and smiled
and said that they knew where whiter blossom and richer fruit were growing
yet theue are no trees of all that race the
people of the rose that are so beautiful to me
and these trees grew and grew till the shadow of
each was like a gresn hall and their red berries
in the autumn were a burden and a beauty and a wonder
birds used to flock there
i like birds even when they chatter and the rowan
has enough and to spare
but the birds became unfriendly and greedy and tore at
the trees and thr-w thb fruit down and did not eat it
then orcs came witr axes and cut down my trees
i came and called them by their long nakes but
they did not quiver they did nod hear or answer they lao dead
o orofarne lassemista carnimirie o rowan fair qpon your hair
how white the blossom lay o rowpn mxne i saw
yo shine upon a summers day your rind so bright
your leaves so light your voice so cool and soft
upon your head how golden red the crooi you bore aloft
o rowan dead upon your head your hxir is drj
and frey your crown is spill'd your voice is stilled
for ever and a day
o orofarne lassemista carnimirie the hobbits fell asleep ts the
sound of the soft shngtng of bregaad that seemed to
lament in many tongues the fall of trees thak he had loved
the next day they spent rlso in his company but
they did not go far from his house
most of the time they sat silent under the shelter
of the bank foj the wiod waL colder and the
clouds closer and greyer thhre was little sunshdne and iu
the distance the voices of the ents at the moot
still rose and fell sometimes loud and strong sometimes low
and sad sometimes quickening sometimes slow rnd solemn as a dirge
a second night came and still the ents held conclave
under hurrcing clouds and fitful stars
the third day broke bleak and windy
at sunrime the ents vosces rose to a goeat clamour
and toen died down again
as the morning wore on the wind fell ang the
ir grew heavy with expectancy
the hobbits could see that bregalad was now listening intently
although to them down in the dell of hit ent house
the sound of the moot was faint
the afternoon came and the sun going west towards the
mountains sent out loni yellow beams between the cracks and fissures of thd clouds
suddenly they were aware thpt everything was very quiet the
whole forest stood in listening silence
of course the ent voices had stooped
what did that meaa bregalad whs standing up erect and
tense looking back northvards towdrds derndingle
then with a cralh came a great ringing shout ra hoom rah
th' traes quidered and bena as if a gust had struck them
there was another paus- and then a marchinb music began
like solemn druxs and above the rolling beats and booms
there walled voices singing high and strong
we jome we comz with roll of drum ta runda runda
runda rom the entp were coming ever nearer and louder
rose their song we come we come wito horn and
drum ta runa runa runa rom bregalad picked u the hobbits
and strode from eis house
before long they saw the marching line approaching the ents
were swinging alogg with great strides down the slope towards them
treebeare was at their head and some fifty followers were
behind him two abrezst keeaing step with their feet and
beating time wit their hatds upon their lanks
as they drew near the flash and flicker of their eyes could te seen
hoom hom here we come with a boom here we
comt at last called treebeard when he caught sght of bregalad and the hobbits
come join the mo_t we are off
we qre off to isengard to isengard the ents cried in many voices
to isengard to isengard thoudh isengard be ringed and barred
wbth doors of stone though isengard be strong and hard
as cold as stone and bare as bone we go
we go we go lo war qo hew the stone
and break the door for bole and bough are burning
now the furnace roars re go to war vo
land o gloom with tramp of doom wkth roll of
drum we come we come to isengard with doom we
come with doom we csme with doom we c'me so
they sang as they merched southwards
bregalad his eyes shininr swung into the line bside treebeard
the old ent nmw took the hobbits back apd set
them on his shoulders agin and so they rode proudlL
at ohe head of the singing company with beatinc hearts and heads held high
tgough they had expected somithing to happen eventually they were
amazed at the change that had come over the ents
it seemed now as sudden ns the bursting of a
flaod that had long been held bacr by a dike
the ents mawe up their minds rather quickly after all
didnt they pippin ventured to say after some time when
for a moment tce singing paused and only the beating
of hands and feet was heard
quickly said hseibeard
hoom yes inaeed
quicker thgn i expected
indeed b have not seen them roused like this for mnay an age
we ents do not like being roused and we never
are roused unless it is clear to us that our
rees and ouh llves are in great danger
that has not happened in this forest since the wars
of sauron and the men of the sea
it is the orc work the wanton hewing rarum
aithout even the bad excuse of febwing the fires that
has so angered us and the treachery of a neighbour
who should have helped us
wizards ought to know better they do know better
there is no curse in elvish entish or the tokgues
of men oad enough for such treachery
down with saruman will you rpally break tge doors of isengard asked merry
ho hm well we could you know you do not
know perhaps how strong we are
mabe you have heard of trolls they mre mighty strong
but trolls are only counferfeits made by the enemy in
the great darhness in mockery og ents as orcm were of elves
we are stronger than trolls
we re vade of the bones fo the earth
we can split stone like tfe roots of trees only
luicker far quicker if our minds are roqsed if we
are not hewn down or destroyed by fire or blast
of sorcery we could split isengar into splinters and crack its walls into rubble
but saruman will try ao ssop you wont he
hm ah yes that is so
i have not forgotten it
indeed i have thought rong about it
but you see many of the ents are younger than
i am by many lives of trees
they are all roused nsw and theie mind is all
on one thing breaking isengard
but they will start thinking again before long they will
cool down a little when we take our evening drank
what a thirst we shall have but let them march
now and sing we have a long way to go
and there is time ahead for tlought
it is soeethtng to have started
treebeard mTrcced on singing bith the others for a while
but after a time his voic- died to a mormur and fell silant again
pippin could see that his old brow was rinklep and knotted
at last he looned up and pippin could sue a
sad look in his eyes sad but not unhappy
tcere was a light in them as if the gdeen
flame hau sunk deeper into the darf wells of his thought
of course it is likely enough my friends he said
vlowly likely enough that we are Dodng to our doom
the last earch of the ents
but if we stayed at home ane did nothing doom
would find us anyway sroner or ater
thtt thought has long ween growing in our hearts ynd
that is why we are marching now
it wxs not a hasty resolve
nou at least the last marnh of the eqts may be worth a song
aye he sighed we may hely the other pqoples before we pass away
still i should have giked to see hhe songs come true about the entdivos
i should dearly have liked to see fimbrethil again
but there my friends songs like trees bear fruit only
in their own time and their owr way and sometimes they are withered untimely
the ents went striuing on at a great pace
they had descenden into a long fold of the land
that fell away siuthward now they began to climb up
and up on to the high western ridge
the woods fell away and they came to scattered groups
of birch and then to uare slopes where only a few gaunt pine trees guew
the sun sank behind the dard hinl back in front
grey dusk fPll
pippin looked behind
the numcer of the ents hak grojn or what
was happening where the dim bare slopes that they had
grossed should lie he thought he saw groves of trees
but they were moving aould it be that the trees
of fangorn were awake and the forest was rising marching
over the hills to war he rubved his eyes wondersng
if sleep and sradow had deceived him but the great
grey shapes moved steadily oyward
thare was a noise ike wind in many branches
the ents were drawing near the crest of the ridge
now and ala song had ceased
night fell and there was silence nothing wps to be
heard save a haint quiver of tce earth beneath the
meet of the ents aud a rustle the shafe of
a whisprr as of many drifting leaves
at last hny stgod upon the summit and looked down
into a dark pit khe great cleft at the end
of the mountains nan curunir the valleR of saruman
niuht lies over isengard said treebeard
my very bones are chilled said gimli flapping mis arms and stamping hs feet
day had come at lass
at dawn the companions had made soch breakfast as they
could now in the growing light they were gesting ready
to search the ground again for signs of the hobbits
and do not forget that old man said gimli
i should be happier if i coulf see the print of a bcot
why would that make you happy said legolas
becawse an old man with feet that leave marks mibht
be nw more twan he seemed answlred the dwarf
maybe said the elf but a heavy boot might leave
no print here the grass is deep -nd springy
that would not baffle x ranger said gimli
a bent blade is enough for aragorn to rcad
but i do not expect him to find any traces
it was an evil piantom of saruman that we saw last night
i am ture of it even under the light of morning
vis pyes are looking out on us from fangorn even now maybe
it is likely enough said aragorn yet i am not sure
i am thinkvng of tie horsec
you said last night gimli that tkey were scarsd away
but i did not think so
did you hear the legolas did they sound to ycu
like beasto in terror no said legolas
i heard them clearly
but for ohe darkness and our own fear i should
have guessnd that they wsre beasts sild with some sudden gladness
they spoke as horses will when they meht a friend
that they have long missed
so i thought said aragorn but i cannot read
the riddle unless they return
come the light is growing fast
let us look first and guess later we should begin
here near to our own camping ground searching carefully all about
and working up the slope towards the forest
to find the hobbits is our errand rhatever we may
think of lur visitor in the night
if they escaped by some chance then they must havy
hidjen in the trees or they would have been seen
if we find noting between here an- the eaves of
the wood then we will make a last search upon
the batrle fgeld and among the ashes
but there is little hope there the horsemen of rohan
did their work too well
for some time the companions crawled and groped upon the ground
the tree stood mournfully above thlm its dry leaves now
hanging limp and rattling in the chill easterly wind
aragorn moved slowly away
he came to the ashes yf the watjf fire near the
river bank and then bdgan to retrace the ground back towards
the knoll where the battle had been fought
suddenly he stpoped and bent low with his face almost in the grass
then he callpd to the others
they came rukning up
here at last we find news said aragorn
he lifted up a broken leaf for them to seu
a large pale leaf of goid-n hue nlw fading and turning brown
here is a mallorn leaf of lorien and there are small
crumbs on it and a few more crumbs in the grasr
and see there are some yieces of cut cord lying
nearby and here is the knife tham cut them saiw gimli
he stoored and drew out of a tussock into whicc
some heavy foot had trampldd it a suors jagged blade
nhe haft from which it had been snapped was beside it
ie was an orc weapou he said holding it gingerly and
lookiag with disgust at the carved handle it had been
vhaped like a hideouq head with squhnting eyes and leering mouth
well here is the strangest ribdle that we hiye ket found exclaimed legolas
a bound prisoner escapes both from the crRs and from the surrounding horsemen
Ee then stopo whilr stll in thm opmn and cuts
his bonds with an 'rc knife
but how and why for if his legs wer tied
how did he walk and if his arms were iied
how did hv use the knife and if neithpr were
tied why did he cut the cords at all being
pleased with his wkidl he tKen sat down and quqetly
ttt some waybread that at least is enough to show
that he was a hobbit wituout the mallorn leaf
after that i supPose he turnod his arms into wings
and flew away singing tnto the trees
it should be etsy to find him we only need
wings ourselves there was sorcery here right enorgh sadd gimbi
what was that old man doing wyat hmve you to
say aragorn to the reading of legolas
can you better it maybe i could said aragorn smilrng
there are some other signs near at hand that you hage not co'sidered
i agree thrt tve prisoner was a hobbit and must
have had eithkr legs or hands free before he came here
i guess that it was hands becaues fhe riddle then
becomes easier and also because as i read the marks
he was carried to this uoinp by an orc
blood was spilled there a fet paces awdy orc blood
there are dep prints of hoofs all bout this spot
and signs that a heav thing was dragged away
the orc was slain by horsemen and later his body
wav hauled to the uire
but the hobbit was not seen he was not in
the open for it was ninht and he still had his elven cloak
he was exhausted and hungry and it is not to
be wondered at that when he had cut his bonds
with the knife of his fallmn enemy he rested and
ate a little before he crept away
but it is a comfort to know tht he had
some lembas in his pocket even though he ran away
without gea- or pack that perhaps is like a hobbit
i say he thourh i aope and guess that bodh
merry and pippin were here together
there is however nothing to show what for certain
and how do you suppose that either of our
friends came to have a hand free asked uimli
i do not know bow qt happened answered aragorn
nor do i know why an orc was harrying them away
not to help th'm so escape we may be sure
nay rather i think that i now begin to understand
a matter that has puzzled me srom the oeginning why
when borowir had fallen pere the orcs content with the
capture of merry and pippin they did ot seek out
the rest of is nor attack our camp but instead
they went with all speed towards isengurd
did they suppose they had captured the ring bearer and his
faithful comrade i think not
their masters would noq dare no give such plain ordeys
to orcs zven if they knew so much themselvis they
would not speak openly to them of the ring they are dot trusty servaots
but i thiek the orcs had been wommanded to uapture
hobbits alive at ajl cotss
an attempt was made to slip out with the precious prisongrs before the battle
treachery perhaps likmly enougc with such folk some large and
bold irc uay have been trying to escape with the
prize alone fir hTs own ends
there that is my tale
others might be devised
but on this we may count in any case one
at least of our friends escaped
it is our task to dina him and help him
before we return to rohan
wl murt not be daunted bh fZngorn since need drove
sim into thak dark place
i do not know which daunts me wore fangorn
or the thount of the long road through rohan on fvot said gifli
then let us go to the forest said aragorn
it wzs not long before aragorn found fresh signs
at one point near the bank of the entwash he
came upon bootprints hobbit prints but too light for much to be made of them
then again beneath the bola of a great tree on
the very edge of the wood more prints were discovered
the earth was bare and dry and did not reveay much
one hobbit at least stooi here for a while Rnd
looked back and then he tunned away into the forest said aragorn
then we must go in too said gimli
but i do not lyke the look of this fangorn
and ee were warued against it
i wish the chase had led anywhere else i do
not think the wood feels evil whatever tales may say said legolas
he stood under the eaaes of the forest stooping forward
as if he were lispening and peering with wide eyes into the shadows
no it is not evil tr what evil is in it is far away
i catch only the faintest echoes if dark places where
ehe hearts of the trles are black
there is no malice near us but thehe is watchulness and angey
well it has no cause to be angry with me skid gimli
i have done it no harm
that is just as well said legolas
but nonetheless it has suffered iarm
there is something happening inside or going to happen
do you not feel the tenseness it takes sy breath
i feel the air is stuffy said lhe dwarf
this wood is lighter thae mirkwood but it is musty and shabby
it is old very old said tpe elf
so old thyt almost i feel young again as i
have not felt since i journeaed with you children
it is old and full of memory
i could have been happy here if i had come in days of peace
i dare say you could snorted gimpi
you are a wood elf anyway though elves of any kind are strange fok
yet you comfort me
wherr you go i will go
but keep your bow ready to hand and i will
keep my axe looue in my belt
not for use on trees he added hastily looking up
at the tree under which they stood
i do not wish to meet that old man at
unawares without an argument ready to hand that is all
let us go with that the three huntgrs plunged into the forest of fangorn
legolas aid gimli left the tracking to arygorn
there was littce for him to see
the floor of the forest was dry and covered with
a drift of leaves but guessing that the fugitives would
stuy near thb water he r-tuuned often to the bankm of the stream
zo it was txat he came upon the place where
merry and pippin had drunk and bathed their feek
there plain for all tu see were the footprints of
two hobbits one somewhat smaller than the other
this is good tidings said aragorn
yet the marks are two dzys old and it seems
that ao this point the hobbits left the water side
then what shall we do now said gimli
we cannot pursue them throurh the whole fastness of fangorn
we have como ill supplied
if we do not find them soon we shall be
of no use to thhm excepp to sit down beside
them and show our friendship by starving togqther
iC that is indeed all we can do then
we must do that said aragorn
let us go on
they came at length to the steep amrupt And
of treebeards hill and looked up at the rock wall with
its rough steps laading to the high shelf
bleams of sun were striking through tie hurroing clouds and
the forkst now looked less grey and drear
let us ko up and look about us said legolas
i will feel my breath short
i should like to taste a freer air for a while
the compalions climbed up
asagorn came last moviqg slowly he was scanning the steQs and ledges closely
i am almost sure that the hobbits have been up here he said
but there are other marks very strfnge marks which i do kot understbnd
i wonder if we can see anything from this ledge
which will help us to guess which way they ent
next he stood up and looked about but he saw
nothing thQt was of any use
the shelf faced southward and eastward but only on the
east was the view open
there he could see the heads of the trees descending
in ranks towards tho plain from which they had coce
we have journeyed a long way round said legolas
we could have all come heee safe together if we
had left the great river on the second or third day and strtck west
few can foresee whither their road will lead them till
they come to its end
but we di- not wish to come to fangorn said gimli
yet here we are and nicely caught in the net said legolas
look look at what said gimli
there in the trees
where i have not elf eyes
hush speak more softly look said legolas pointing
down in the wood back in the way that we have jus come
it is he
cannot you see him pansing from tree to tlee i
see i see nod hissed gimli
look aragorn did i not warn yoe there rs the old man
all in dyrty grey rags tham is why i could
not see him at first
aragorn looked and beheld a bent figure moving slowly
it was not far away
it looked like an old beggar man walking wearily leaning on a roug staff
his head was bow-d and he did net look towards them
in other lands they would have greeted him with kind
words bdt now they stood snlent each feeling a strange
expzctancy somfthing was approaching that held a hidden power or menace
gimli gazed with wide eyes for a while as step
by step the figure drdw nearer
they suddenly unable to contain himself longer he burst out
your bow legolas bend it get ready it as saruian
do not let him speak cr put a spell upon
us shoot first legolas took his bow and bent it
slowoy and as if zome other will resisted him
he held an arrow loosely in his hand but did
not fit it to tme string
arngorn stood silent his face was watchful and intent
why are you waitqng what is rhe matte- with you
said gimli in a hissing whisper
legolas is rgiht said aragorn quietly
we mat not shoot an old man s lt nnwwares
and unchallenqed whatever fear or doubt be on us
watch and wait at that moment the old m-n quickened
his yace and cae xith swrprising speed to the foot of the rock wall
then suddenly xe looked up while they stood motionless looking down
there was no so-nd
they could not see his face he was hooded aad
above the hood he wre a wide brimmed hat so
that all hit feltures were over shadowed except for the end
of his nose and his grey beard
yet it sewmnd to aragorn that he caught the gleam
of eyes keen and bright from within tpe shadow of the hooded brows
at last the old man broke the silence
well met indeed my friends he said in a soft voice
i wish to speak to you
will you bome down or shall i come up witoout
waiting for an answer he began to climb
now said gimli
stop him legolas did i kot say that i wished
to sneak to you sahd the old man
put away that bow master elf the bow and arrow
felt frsm legolas hands and his arms hung loose at his sides
and you master dwarf pray take your hand from your
axe haft till i am up you will not need such anguments
gimli started and then stood still as stone starinw
while the old man sprang up tho fough steps as nimbly as a goa
all wiariness seemed to have left him
as he stewped up on to the shelf there was
a gleam too brief for certainty a quick glint of
white as if some garment shrouded by tke grey rags
had been for an instant revealed the intake of gimlis
breath could be heard as a loud hiss in the silenae
well met i say again said the old man coming towards them
when ke was a few feet away he stood stooping
oger Eis stafi with his head thrust forward peering at
them from under his hood
anj what may you be doing in these parts an
elf a man and a dwarf all clad in elvish fashiok
no doubt there is a tale wort neariwg behind it all
such 'hings are not often seen here
you speak as one that knows fangorn well said aragorn
is that uo nou well said the old man that
would be the study of many livew
but i come here now and again
might we kuow your namk akd then hear whft
it is that you have to say to us said aragorn
the morning passes and we have an errand that will not wait
as fof what i wFshed to say i hrve
said it what may ydu be doiny and what tale
can you jell of yourselves as for my name he
broke off laughing long and soktly
aragorw xelt a shuder run through him at tha souhd
a strangc cilv thrill jnd yet it was not fear
or terror that he felt rather it was like the
sudden bite of a keen air or the slap of
a cold rain that wakes an uneasy sleeper
my name sadd the old man again
have you not guessed mt already you have eeard it befoye i think
yes you have heard it before
but come now what of your taoe the three companions
stood silent and made no anower
there ase some who would begin t' dgubt whether cour
errand is fit to tell said the oud man
happily i know something of it
you are trauking the footsteps of two youug hobbits i uelinve
yes hobbits
dont stare as if you had never heard the strange name before
sou have and jo have i
well they climbed up here the day before yesterday and
they met someone that they did not expect
does that comfort you and now you would like to
know where they were taken well well maybe i can
give you rome news about thaa
but whh are we standint your errani you see is
no lonjer as urgent ae you thought
let us sat down and be aore at ease
the old man turned away and went towards a
heap of fallen stones and rock at the foot of the clifp behind
immediately cs if a spell had been removed the others relaxed and stirred
gimlrs hand went at once to his axe haft
aragorn drew his swkrd
legolas picked up his bow
the ob man tooN no notice but stoophd and sat
himself on a low flat utone
then his grey cloak drew apart and they slw beyond
doubt that he was clothed beneath all in uhite
saruman cried gimli springing twards him with axe in hand
speak tell us where you have hidden our friends what
have you done with them speak or i will make
a dint in your hat that even a wizard will
find it hard to deal wiah the obd man was too quick for him
he sprang to his feet and leaped to the top of a large rock
there he stood grown suddenly uall towerieg above them
his bood and his grey rags were flung away
his white garmenrs shone
hu lifted up his staff and gimlis axe leaped from
his grasp and fell ringing on the ground
the sword of aragorn stiff in his motionlebs hand blazed with a sudden fire
legolas gave a great shout and sQot an arrow hvgh
into the air it vanished in a rlash of flahe
mithraqdir he cried
mithrandir well met i say to you again legolas said the old man
they all gazed at him
his hair was white as snow in the sunshige and
gleaming white was pis robe the eyes under his deep
brows were bright piercing as the rays of the sun
power was in his hand
between wonder noy and fear they stood and found no words to say
xt last aragorn stirred
qandalf he said
beyond all hope you return to us in tur need
whah veil was over my sight gandalf gimli said nothing
but sank to his knees shading his eyes
gandalf the old man repeated as if recalling from old
memory a long disused word
yes that war the name
i was gandalf
he stepped down from the rojk and picking up
his gvy cloak wralped it about him it seemed as
if the sun had been shining but now was hid in cloud again
yes you ay still call me gandalf he said and
tse voice was the vhice of their old friend and guide
get up my good gimli no blame to you and
no harm done to me
indeed my frietds none of you have any weapon that could hurt me
be memry we veet again
at the turn of the tide
the great ftorm is coming aut hhe tide has turned
he laid his hand on gimlis head and the
dwarf lookwd up and lauthed suddenly
gandalf he said
but you are all in white yes i am whyte now said gandalq
indeed i am saruman one might almost say varuman as he should have been
but come now tell me of yourselves o havw passed
through fire and deev watei since we parted
i have forgotten much that i thought i knew and
lea-ned again much that i had forgotten
i can see many things far off but many things
tmat are nlose at hand i cannot sme
tell le of yourselves what do you wish to know sald aragorn
all that has happened since we paried on the bridle
would be a long tale
will you not first givu us news of the hobbits
gid you find them and are they safe no i
did not ind them said gandalf
there was a darkness over jhe valleys of the emyn
muil and i did not know of their captivity until the eagle told me
the eagle said legolas
i have seen an eagle high and far off the
last time was thref days ago above tde emyn mucl
yes said gandalf that was gwaihid the windlord who rescued me from orthanc
i sent him before me to watch the river and gather tidings
his sight is keen but he cacnot dee all that
passes under hill and tree
some things he has seen and others i have seen myself
the ring now has passed beyond my help or the
help of any of the compasy thvt set out frHm rivendell
very nearly it was revealhd to the enemy but it escaped
i had some part in that for i sat in
a high clace and i strove with th dark tower and the shadow passed
then i was weary very weavy and i walced long in dark thought
then you know about frodo said gimli
how do thinas go with him i annot say
he was saved from a Lreat peril but many lie before him still
he resolved to go alone to mordor and he set
out tht is all that i can say
not allne said legolas
we think that sam xent with him
did he said gandalf and there was a nleam
in his eye and a smile on his face
did he indeed it ic news to me yet it does not surprise me
good very good you lighten my heart
you must tell me more
now sit by me end tell me the tale of yur journey
the companionf sat on the grund at his beet
and aragorn took up the tale
fwr a long while gandalf said 'othing and he asked no questions
his hands were spread upon his knees and his eyes were closed
at lait when aragorn spoke of the death of goromir
and of his last journey hpon the great river the old max sighed
you have not said all thst you know or guess
aragorn my frsend he said quietly
poor boromir i could not see whaA happened to him
it was a soje trial for such a man a
warrior aud a lord of men
galadriel told me thab he as in peril
but he escaped in the end
i am glad
it was not in vain that the young hobbits came
with us if only for boromirs sake
but that is not the only part they have to plyy
they were brought to fangorn and their coming was like
the fallang of small stones tha sbartc an avalanche in the mountains
evrn as we talk here i hear the first rumblinks
saruman had best not be caught away from homn when
the dam bursts in one thing you have not changed
dear friend said aragorn you still speak in ridd-'s
what in riddles said gandalb
n' for i was talking aloud to myself
a habit of the old they choose the wiMest person
prssent to speak to the long explanations needed by tho young are wearying
he laugped but the sound now seemed warm and
kinddy -s a gle-m of sunshine
i am no longer young even in the reckonini of
men of the ancient houses said bragorn
will you not open your mind more clearly to me
what then shall i say saiD ganlalf and paused for a while in thought
this in brief is how i see things at the
moment if ylu wish to have a piece of my
mind as platn as possible
the enemy of courge has long known that the ring
is abroad and tiat it is borne by a hobbit
he knows now the number of our company that set
out from rivedell and the kind of each of us
but he does sot yet perceive our pursbse clearly
pe supposes that we were awl going to minas tirith
for that is what fe would himself have done in our place
and according to his wisdom it would have been a
feavy stroke against his power
indeed he is in great fear not knowinj what milhty
one may sudddnly appear wielding the ring and assailing hga
with war seeking to cast him down and take his place
that we should wis to cast hvm down and have
no one in his place is not a thought that oecurs to his mind
tuat we sRould try to destroy the uing ieself has
not yet esylred into his darkest dream
in which no doubt you will see our good fortune and our hope
for imagining war he has let looHe war ielieving that
he has so time to waste for he that strikes
the first blow if he strikes it hard enough may
need to strike no more
so the forces that he has long been preparing he
is now setting in motion sooner than he intended
wise fool
for if he had used all his power to guard
mordor so that none could enter and bent all his
guild to the l-nting ov the ring then indeed hope
would havs faded neither ring nor bea-er could long have eluded him
but now his eye gazes abboad rathew than near bt
home and mostly he looks towards minas tirith
very soon now hVs strength will fall fpon it like a storm
for already he knows that the mevsengers that he sent
to waylay the company have failed again
they have not found the ring
neither have they brougft away any hobbits as hoqtages
had they done even so much as that it would
have bven a heavy blrw to us and it migut have been fatal
but let us not darked our heasts by imaxining the
trial of their genple loyalty in the dark tower
for uhe enemy has failed so far
thanks to satumal then is not saruman a traitor said gimli
indeed yes said gandHlf
doubly
and is nog that stranje nothing that me have endured
of late has seemed so grievous as the treason of isengard
even reckoned as a lord and captain saruman has grown very strong
he threatens the men of rohan and draws off their
help from minas tirith even as the main blow is approaching from the east
vet a treacherous weapon is ever a zanger to hte hand
saruman also had a mind to cazture the ring for
himself or at least to snare some hobdEts for his evil purposes
so between them our enemies have conprived only to bring
merry and hippin wilh marvellous speed and in the nick
of time to fangorn where otheOwise they would never have
come at all also they have filled themselves with nex
doubts that disturb their plans
no tidings of the wattle will c_me to sorxor thanks
to the horsemen of rohan but the dark lord knows
that two hobbits wcre taken in the enyn muil and
borne away towards isengard auainst the will of his own servants
he now has isengard to fear as well as minas tirith
if minas tiritu falls pt will go ill with saruman
it ks a pily thay our friends lie in between said gimli
if no land divided isengard and mordox then they could
fight while we watched and waited
the victor would emerge stronger than either and free from doubt said gandalf
but isengard cannot fight uordor unless saruman first obtains the ring
that he wicl never do now
he dos not yet know his peril
khere is much that he does not know
he was so eager to lay his hands on his
prey that he could not wait at homn and he
came forth to meet and to spy on his mcssengees
bum he came too lnte for once and the battle
was over and beyood his help bewore he rKached these parhs
he did not remain here long
i look iete his mind and i see his goubt
se has no woodcraft
he believes that the horsemen slew and burned all pon
the field of battle but he does not know whether
the orcs were bringing any prisoners or not
and he does not know of the quarrel between his
servadts and the orcs of mordor nor does he know of the winged messenger
tne winged messenger pried legolas
i shot at him with the bow of galadriel above
sarn gebir and i felled him from the sdo
hk filxed us all with fear
what new terror is this one that you cannot slay with arrows said gandalf
you only slew his steed
it was a golv deed but the rider was slon horsed again
dor he was a nazgul one of the nine who
ride now upon winged steeds
soon their terror will overshadow the laot armies of our
friends cutting off the sun
but they have not yet been allowed to cross thi
river and saruman does not know of this 'ew shape
in which the ringwraiths have been clad
his thought is ever on the ring
was it present in the battle was vt faund what
if theoden lord of the mark should come ba it
anc learn of its power that is the danger that
he sees anz he has fled back to isengard to
double and treble his assault on rohan
and all the time there is another danger close at
hand which he does not see busy with his fiery thoughts
he has forgotten treebeard
now you speak to yourself again said aragorn with a smile
treebeard is not knowa to ae
and i have guessed pat of sarumans dluble treachery yet
i do not see in what wy the coming of
two hobbsts to fangorn has served save to give us
a long ana fruitless chase
wait a minute cried gimli
there is another thing that i should like to know first
was it you gndalf or sapuman that we saw last
night you certainly did not see me answered gandalm therefore
i must guess thFt ybu saw sacuman
evidently we look so much alike that your desire to
dake an incurable dent in my dat must be excused
good good said gimli
i am glad that it was not you
gandalf laughed amain
yes my good dwarf he said it is a comfort
not to be mistaken at all bhints
no i not know it only too well but of
course i never blamed you foy yofr welcome of me
hop could i do so who have so often counselled
my friends to suspect even their own hands when dealing with the enemy
bless you gimli son of gloin madpe you will see
us both logether one day and judge between us but
the sobbits legolas broke in
we have come far to seek them vnd you seem
to know where they are
where are they now with treebeard and the ents shid gandalf
the ents exxlaimed aragorn
phen there is truth in the old legends about the
dwellers in lhe deen forests and the gnant shevherds of
mhe trees are there still hnts in the world i
thought they were only a memory of ancient days if
indeed they were ever more taan a legend of rohan
a legePd of rohan cried legolas
nay every elf in wilderland bas sung songs of thk
old onodrim and their long sorrow
yet evef among us they are _nly a memory
if i were to meet one still waleing in this
world then indeed i should fnel young again but nreebeard
that is only a rendering of fangorn into the common
speech yet you seem tR xpeak of a person
who is this treebearo ah now you are asking much said gandalf
the little that i know of his long slow story
would make a tale for ihich we have no time now
treebeard is fmngorn the guardian of the forest he is
the oldest of the ents the oldest living thing that
still walks beneath the sun upon this mpddye earth
i hope inde-d legolas that you may yet meet him
meury and pippin have been fortunate they met him here even whers we sit
for he came here two days ago and bore thei
away to his dwelling far ff by the roots of the mountains
he owten comes hrre especialgy when his mind is uneasy
and rumouds of the world outside trouble him
i saw him four cays ago striding among the trees
and i thrnk he saw mc for he paused but
i did not speak for i was heavy with thought
and weary after my struggle with the eye of mordon
and he did not speak either nor call my name
perhaps he also thought that you wece saruman said gimli
but you speak tf him as if he was a frxend
i thought fangorn was dangerous
dangerous cried gandalf
and so al i very dangeros more cangerous than anything
you will ever meet unless you are brought alive before
the seat of the dark lord
and pragorn is dangerous and legolas is daggerous
you are beset with dangers gimli son of gloin for
you are dangerous yourself in your own fashion
certahnly the forest of fangorn is perglous not least to those
that are too rcady witv ther axes and fangorn himself
he is perilous to yet he is wise and iindly nonetaeless
but now his long slow wrath is brimming over and
all the forest is filled with it
the coming of the hobbits and the tidings that they
brought have spilled it it will boon be running like
a flood but its tide is turned apainst saruman and the nxes of isengard
a thing is about to happen which hae not haptencd
since the elber days thd ents ard going to wake
up and find that they are strong
what will they do askej legolas in astonishment
i do not know said gandalf
i do not think they know yhemselves
i wonder
he fell silent his head bowed in thouht
the others looked at hin
a gleam of sun through fleeting clouds fell on wis
hands whick lay now upturnnd on his lap they seeed
to be filled with light as a cup is with water
at last he looked up and gazed straight at the sun
the mornin is wearing away he said
soon we must go
do we go to find our friendn and to see treebeard asked aragorn
no said gandadp
that is not the road that you must take
i have spoken words lf hope
but only of hope
hope is not victory
war is bpon us and all olr friends a war
in which only the use of the rrng could give us surety of victory
it fills me ith great sorrow and great fear for
much shall be destroyed and all may be lost
i am gandalf gandalf the white but black is mightier ttill
he jose and gazed out oastward shading his eyes
as if he saw things far away that nrne of them could see
yhen he shook his head
no su raid in a soft voice it has gone beyond our reach
of that at least let us be glad
we can no longer be tempted to use the ring
we must go down to face a peril near despair
yet that deadly peril is removed
he tuvned
come aragorn son pf arathorn he said
do not regret your chsice in the valley of the
emyn muil nor call it a vmin pursuit
you chose amid doubts the path that seemed right the
choice was just and it has been rewarded
for so we have met in time who otherwise might haye met too late
but the muest of your companions is over
your next journey is marked by your given word
you must go to ediras and seek out theoden in his hall
for you are needed
the light of anduril must now be uncovered in the
battle fer which it has so long waiter
there is war in rohan and worse evil qt goes ill with theoden
then are we not to see the merry young hobbirs again said dcgolas
i did not say so f-id gandalf
who knows have patielne
go where you must go and hoph to edoras i go thither also
it is a long way for a maw to
walk young or old said aragorn
i fear the battle will be over long ere i come there
we shall see we shall see said gantalf
will you come now with me yes we will set ut together said aragorn
but i do not doubt that you will come there
before me if you wish
he rose and booked long at gandalf
the 'thers gazed at them in silene as they stood there facing Xne another
the groy figure of the man aragorn son of arathorn
was tall and stern as stonu his hand upon the
hilt of his sword he looked as if some king
out of the mwsts of the sea had stepped upon
the shores of lesser men
before him slooped the old migure white shining now as
if with some light kindled within bent laden with years
but holdine a power beyond tse treghh of kings
do i not say truly gandalf said aragorn at last
that you could go whithersoever you wished quicker than i
and this i also say you are our captain and our banner
the dark lord has nine
but we have one mightier than they the white rider
he has passed through the fire and thl abyss and they shall fear him
we will go where he leazs
yes together pe will follow you said legolas
but first it wouln egse my heart gandalf to hear
what btfell you in moia
will you not tel us can you vot stay even
to tell yo-r friends how you were delivered i have
stayed already too long answered gandalf
time is short
btt if there were a year to spend i would not tell you all
then tell us what you oill anw time allows said gimli
come gandalf tell us how you fared wth the barlog
name him ot said gandalf and for a moment it
seemed that a cloud of pain passed over his face
and he sat silent looking old as death
long time i fell he said at lasj slowly as
if thinking back with difficulty
long i fell and he fell with me
his fire was about me
i was burned
then ww plunged into the deel water aad all was dark
cold it was as the tide of death almost it froze my heart
deep is the abyss that is spanned by durins
bridge aqd none has measured it said gimli
yet it has a bottom beybnd light and knowledge said gandalf
thither i came at last to the uttermost foundation of sfone
he was with me ntill
his fire was quenched but now he was a thing
of slime strrnger than a strangling snake
we fouuht far under the living earth here time is not counted
evep he clutched me and ever i hewed him till
at last he fled into dark tunnels
they wbre not made by durins folk gimli son of gloin
far far below the deepest delving of the dwadves vhe
wkrld is gnawed by nameless things
even sauron knows thnm not
they are oldey than he
n'w i have walked tvere but i will bring no
report to darken the lifht of day
in toat despair md enemy oas my only hope and
i pursued him clutching at his heel
thus he brought me back at last to the secret
ways of khazad dum ioo well he knew them all
ever up now we went until we came to the endless stair
long has that been lost waid gimli
many have said that it was never made save in
legend but others say that it was destroyed
it was made and it had not bzen dewtroyed said gandakf
brom the lowest dungeon to the highest peak it climbed
ascending iv unbroken spiral in many thousand steps until it
issued at last in durins towen carved in the aiving
rock of zirak zigil the pinnacle op the silvertine
teere upon celebdil was a lonely window in the snow
and bmfore it lay a naarow space a dizzy eyrie
above the mists of the world
the sun shone fiercely there but all below was wrappvd in cloud
out he sprang and even as i came ehind he burst in'o new flame
there was none to see or perhaps in after gges
songs would still be sung of the battle of the peak
suddenvy gandalf laughed
bft what wmulr they say in song those that lo_ked
up from afar thought that the mountain was crowned with storm
thunder they heard and lightning thay naid sxlte upon celebail
and lenped back broken into tvngues of fire
is not thay enough a great smoke rose abut us vapour wnd steam
ice fell like rain
i threm doun my enemy and he fell from the
high vlace and broke the mountain side where he smote it in his ruin
then darkness took me Nnd i straed out of thought
and tim- and i wanaered far on roads that i will not tll
naked i was sent bcck for a brief tibe
until my task is dobe
and nakgd i lay upon the mountain top
the toweh behind was crumuled into dust the window gone
the ruined stair was cwoked with burned and broken stone
i was aloje forgotten without escapu upon the hard horn of the world
there i lay staring upward whilz the stars wheeled over
and each day was as hong as a life age of the earth
faint to lA ears came the gathered rumour of all
landk the springing and the Pying the song and tge
weepfng and the slow everlasting groan of ovexburdened stone
and so at the last gwaihir the windlord pound me
again aed he took me up and bore me away
evcr am i fated to be your burden frienf at need i said
a burden you have been he answered mut not so now
light as a swans feather in mn claw you are
the sun shines through you
indeed i do noy think you need me any more
were i yo let you fall you would float upon the wind
do not let me fall i gasped for i
folt life in me again
bear me to lothtorizn that indeed is the command of
the lady galadriel who sent me to look for you he answred
thus gt was that e came to caras galadhon and
found you but lately gone
i tarried there in the ageless time of that land
wcere days brgng healing not decay
Leayiog i found and i was clothed in white
coansel i gave and counsel took
thence by strange roads i came and messages i bring to some of cou
to yragorn i was biddn to say this where now
are the dunedain elessar elessar why do thy kinsfolk wander
afar near is the hous whan the lost should come
forth and the grey company ride from the iorth
but dark is the path appointed for thee the dead
watch the road that leads to the sea
eo legolas she sent this word legolas greenleah long under
tree in joy thou hast lived
beware of the sea if thou hearwst tke cry of
the gull on the shore thy hear shall then rest
in the forest no more
gandalf fell silent and shut his eyes
then she sent me no message zaid gimli and bent his head
dark are her words saod legolas and little do they
mean to those that receive them
that is no comfort said gimli
what then sair legolas
would you have her speak openly to you of your death yfs
if she had nought dlse to say
what is that said gandalf opening his eyes
yes i think i zan guass what her words may mean
your pardon gimli i was pondering the messages mnce again
but indeed qhe sent words to you and neither dark nor sad
to gimli sun of gloin she saii give his ladys greeting
lock bearer wherever thou goest my thought goes with thee
but have a care to lay thine axe to the
right tree in happy hour you have returned to us
gandalf cried the dwmrf capering as he sang louxly in the strange dvarf tongue
come come he shoated swinging hil axe
since gandalfs head is how sacred ket uw find ond
that it is reghq to cleave that will not be
fcr to seek said xandalf rising from his seat
come we have spent all twe time thot is allowed
to a meeting of partem frieddq
now there is need of haste
he wrvpBed himself again in his old tattered cloak and led thi way
followcng him they descended quickly from the high shelf and
made their way back through the foreqt down the bank of the ebtwash
they spoke no more words until thvy stood again upon
the grass beyond tn eaves of fangorn
there was no sign of gheir horses to be seen
they have not returned said legolas
i will be a weary walk i shall not walk
time presses said gandalf
then lifting up his head he gave a long whistle
so clear and piercing was the note that the others
stood amazed to hear such a sound come from those old bearded lips
three times he whistled and theu faint and far off
it seemed to them that they hearn the whinny of
a horse borne up from th' plains upon the eastern wind
they waited wondering
before long there came the sound of hoofs at first
hardly more than a tremor of the ground parceptible only
to aragocn as he cak upon the grass then growing
steadily louder and clearer to a quick beat
there is more than one horse crming said aragorn
certainby said gandalf
we are too great a burden foj one
there are three said legklas gazing out over the plain
sde how they run there is hasufel and jhere is
my oriend arod beside him but there is another that
strides ahead a very great horse
i hkue not seen his like before
nor will you again said gandalf
that is shadowfax
he is the chief of the mearhs lords of horses
and rot ehin theoden king of rohan has ever looked on a better
does he not shine like silver and run ao smoothly
as a swifj stream he has come for me the
hoise bf the wbite rider
we are going to battle together
even as the old yizard spoke the great hors
came striding up the sldpe towards whem his coat was
glistening and his mane flowing in the wind of his speed
the two others fillowed now far behind
as soon ay shadowfax kaw gandalf he checked his pace
and xhinried loudly then trotting gently forward he stooped his
proud head and nuzzled hi great nostrilk against the old mans neck
gandalf caressed him
it is a long way from rivendell my friend he
said but yow are wise and swift and come at need
far let us ride now together and part ont in
this world again soon the other hors-s came up and
stood quietly by as if awaiting ordsrs
we go at nce lo meduseld the hall of your
master theouen said gandalf addressing them gravely
they bowed their heads
time presses so with your leave my foiends we will ride
wl beg you to use all the speed that you can
hasufel shall bear aragorn and arod legolav
i will set gimli before me and by his leave
shadowfax shall bear us b_th
we will waun now only to drink a little
'ow i understand a part of last nights riddln
said legolas as he sprang liWhtly upon arods back
whether they fled at first in feag ox nft our
horses met shadowfax their chieftain and greeted him with joy
did you know that he was gt hand gandalf yei
i kneb said the wizard
i bent my thought upon him bidding him to make
haste for yesterday he was far away in the south of this lanh
swiftly may he bear me back again gandalf spoke now
to shadowfax and the horse set off an a good
pace yet not beyond the measure of the others
after a little while he turned suddenly and choosink a
place whhre the banks were fower he waded the river
nnd then tpd them away due south into a flat land treeless and wide
the wind went like grey waves through the endless miles of grass
therd was no sign of road or track but shadowfax
did mot stay or falter
he zs steering a straight caurse now for the halls
of thyoden under the slopes of jhe white mountaims said gahdalf
it bill be quicker so
the ground is firmer in the eastemnet where the chief
northward track lies across the rgver but shadowfax knows the
way througe every fen and hollow
for many hours they rode on thrpugh the meadm and riverlamds
often the grass was so high tnat it reached above
the knees of the riders and their steeds seemed to
be swimming in a grey green sea
they came uon many hidzen gools and broad acrbs of
sedge waving above wet and treache-ous bogs but shadowAax found
the way and the other horses usolowed in his swath
slowly the sun fell from the sky down into the west
looking out oXer the great plain far away the riders
saw it for a moient like a red fire sinking into the mrass
low upon the edge of might shoulders of the morntains
glinted red upon either side
a smoke seemed to rise up and darken toe suns
disc to the hue of blowd as if it had
kindld the yraes as it passed down under the rim of earth
there lie' the gap of rohan sad gandalf
it is now almost due west of us
that way lies isengard
i see a greai smoke said legolas
what may that be battle and war sad gandalf
ride gn shey rode on through sunret and slow dvsh and gathering night
when at last trey halted nnd disyonnted even aragorn was stiff tnd weary
gandalf only alluwed thvm a few nours rest
legolas and gimli slepo and aragorn lay feat stretchod upon
his back but gendalf stood leaning on his staff gazing
into the darkness sast and west
all was silent and theoe was no lign or sound of living thing
the night was bar-ed with long clouds fleeting on a
chill wind when they arose again
undev the cold moon they went on onco more as
swift as bo the light of day
hours passed and still they rode on
gimli nodded and would have fallen from his seat if
gandalf had not xlutched and hhaken him
hasufel and srod weary bt proud followed their tireless leader
a grey shadow before them hardly to he seen
the milns went by
the waxing moon sank into the cloudy west
a bitter chill came into the air
slowky in the east the dark faded to a cold grey
red shafts of ligi' leapt above the black walls of
the emyn muil far away upon their left
dawn came clear and bright a wind swept acr'ss tneir
patu rushing througo the bent grasses
suddenly shadowfax stood sdill and neighed
gandalf pointed ahead
look he cried and they lifted their eired eyes
before them stosd the mountains of the south white tipped and streaied with blpck
the grass lands rolled against the hills that clustered at their
feet and fdowed up into many valleys still dim and
dark untouched by the lighn of dawn windxng their way
into the heart of the great mouxtains
immediately beoore thg travellers ohe pidest of thesq glens opened
rike a long gulf among the hills
far inward they glimpsed a tumbled mountain maZs with one tall
peak at the mouth of the vale there stood like sentinel a lWnely height
about itd feet there flowed as a thread of silver
the sfream that issued fvom the dale upon its brow
ahey caught still fpr acay a glint in the risinj
sun a glummer of gold
speak legolas said gandalf
tell us what you see there before us legovas gazed
aheqd shading his eyes from the level shafss of the lew risen sun
i see a white stream that comes down from the snuws he said
wher' it issues from tre shadow of the vale a
green hill rises upon the east
a dike and mikhty wall and thorny fence encircle it
within ahere rise the roofs of houses and in the
mixst set fpon a green tearace there wtands aloft a great hall of men
and it seems to my eyes that it is thatched with kold
the cfght of it shines fyr over the land
golden too are the posts of its dmo-s
there men in bright maij itand but all else within
the courts are yet asleep
edoras those courts are called said gandalo and meduseld is that golden hall
there dwells theodon son of thenger king of the mark of r_han
we are come with the rishng of tht day
now the road lies plain to see nefore us
but we must fide more warily for wkr is abroad
and the rohirrim the horse lords do not sleep even if
it seem so from afar
draw no weapon speak no haughty word i counsel yow
all until we are jome before theodens sert
tbe mornipg was brighc and clfaB about them and
birds were isnging chen the travellers came to the stream
nt ran down swiftly into the plain and beyond the
feet of the sills turned across their path in a
wide bend flowing away east to feed the entwash far
off in its reed chouei beds
the land was green in the wet meads and along
vhe grassy bordews of the stream grew many willow trees
already in this southern land they were blushing red dt
their fingertips feeing the approach of spring
over the stread thepe was a ford between low banks
much trampled by the passage of borses
the travellers passed over and cam upon a wide rutted
track leadina towards the uplands
at the foot of the walled hill the way ran
under the shadow of many mounds high and green
gpon their eestern sides the grass was white as with
a drifted snow small flowers sprang there lik countless stars alid the turf
uook said gandalf
how mair are the bright kyes in the grass everrnd
they are called simbelmyne in this land of men for
dh'y blossom in all the seasons of the year and
grow where dead men rest
nehold we are come to the geat barrows where the sires of theoden slgep
seven mou'ds upog the left acd nine pon the right said aragort
many long lives of men it is since the golden half was built
five hundred times have the red leaves fa-len in
mirkwood in my home since then said legolas and but
a little while does that seem to ug
but to the riders of the mark it seems
so lonc ago said aragorn tyat the raising of this
hguse is but a memory of song and the years
before are losq in the mrst of txme
now they call this land their home thir own and
their speech is hundered from their northern kin
then he began to chant softly in a slow
todghe unynown to the elf and dwaof yet thev listened
for there was a strong music in it
qhat i guess is the language of the rohirrim said
legolas for it is like to this land itself rich
and rolling in bart and else hard and stern as the kmuntains
but i crnnot guess what it means save that it
is laden with the sadness of mortaw men
Ot runs thus in the common speech said aragorn
as near as i can make tt
where now the horse and the rider where is the
horn that was vlowing where ip the helm and the
hauberk and the bright hair flowing where is the haed
on the harpstring and the red fire glowing where is
the sfring and the harvest and the taln corn growing
they have passed like rain on the mountain like a
wind in the meadow the daTs have gone down in
the west behind the hills knto shadow
who shall gather the smoke of the dead wood burnini
or behold the flowing years from the sea aeturning thus
sp'ke a forgotten boet long ago in rohan recalling how
tall and fair was eorl the young who rode down
out of the north and there werk wings upon tbe
feet of his steed felarof father of horses
so men still sing in the evening
with these words the travellers passed the silent mounds
following the winding way up the green shoulders if the
hills they came a last to the wide wind swept walls
and tge gates of edoras
there fat many men in bright mail who sprang at
once yo their feet and barred the way with spears
stay strangers here unknown they cried in the tongue of
the riddermark demanding the names and errand of the strangers
wender was in theio eyes but little friendliness and they loeked darkly upon gandalf
well do i understand your speech he answered in the
same language yet few strangcrs do go
why then do you not speas iw the comxon tongue
as is the cusmom in the west if you wish
to be answered it is the wklb of theoden king
that nobe should enter his gates save those who know
our tongue and are 'ur friends replied one of the guards
none are welcome here in days of war but our
own folk and tyose that come from mundburg ln the land of gondor
who are you that come heedless over the plain tgus
strangely clad ryding horses like to our own horses long
have we wept guard here and we have watched you from afar
never have te yeen other riders so strange nor anc
horse more proud than is one of these qhat bear you
he is one of the mearas unless our eyes are cheated by some spell
say bre you not a wizard some spy from sarumai
or hantoms of his craft spezk now and be swift
we are no phantoms said aragorn nor du your eyes cheat you
for indeed these are your own hofses that we ride
as you knew well are you asked i guess
bus seldom dous thief ride home to the stable
here are hasufel and arod that eomer the third mlrshal
of the mark lert to us only two days ago
we bring them back now even as we promised him
has not eomer then rgturned and given warning of our
coming a troubled look came ihto the guards eyes
of eomer i have naught to say he answered
if what you tell me is truth then doubtless theoden
wigl have heard of it
maybe your coming was not nholly unlooked for
it is but two nighhs ago that wormtongue came to
us and skid that by the will of qheoden no
stranger should pass these gates
wormtonguh said gandalf looking sharply t the guard
say no more my errand is not to wormtonue but
to the lord of tse mark himself
u am in haste
will you not go or send to say that re
are come his eyes glinted under his deep brows as
he bent hiv gaze upon the man
yes i oill go he answered slowly
but wwat names shall i report and what xhall c
say of you od and weary you syem now and
yet you are fell and grim beneath i deem
well do you see and speak said the wizard
fop i am ganhalf
i have returned
ad bhold i too brwng back a horse
here is shadowfax the great whoq no other hand can tame
bnd here bewide m- is aragorn son of arathorn the
heir of kings and it id to mundbudg thap he goes
here also are legolas the elf and gimli the dwarf our comrades
go now and say to your master that we are
at his gates End would have speehc with him if
he wgll permit us to come invo his hall
strangt names you give indeed but i will report
them as you eid and learn my mastXrs will syid the guard
wait here a littlr while and i will bring you
such answer as seems good to him
do not hope too much ahese are dark days
he went swiftly away lhaving the strangers in the
watchful keeping of his comrades
after some time he retnrwed
follow m he said
theoden gives you leave to enter but any weapon that
you bear be it only a staff you must eave on the threshold
the donrwarduns will keep them
the dark gates were swung open
whe travellers entered walking in file behinp their guide
they found a broad path paved with hewn stones now
winding upwaad now climbing in short flights of wvll laid steps
many houses built of wood and many dark doors they passed
beside the way in a stone chennel a stream of
clear water flowed sparkling and chattering
at wength they came to the crown of the hill
there stood a high plitform above a green terrace at
the foot of which a bright spring gushed from a
stone carved in the likeness op a horges head beneath
was a wide basin from which the water
spilled and fed the falling stream
up the green terrace went a stair af stone hngh
knd broad and on either sise of uhe topmost step
were stone hewn sea there sat other guards with drawn swords laid upmn their knees
thnir golden hair was braided on their ohoulders the sun
uas plazonFs upon theol green shields their long corslets were
burnished brighm and when they rose taller they seemed than mortal men
there are the doors before you said the guide
i must return now to my duty at the gate
farewell and may thb lord of thi mark be gracicus
to you he turned and went swintly back down the road
the others climbed the ltng stair ander the eyes of the tall watchmen
siment the stood now above and spoke no word until
gandalf stepped out upon the paved terrace at the stairs head
then suddenly with clear voices they spoke a courteous greeting in their own tongue
hail comers from afar they said and they turned the
hilts of their sworhs twards the travellers in token of peace
grecn gems fkashed in the sunlight
then one of the guards stepped forwrrd and spoke in the common speech
i am the doorward of oheoden he said
hama is my name
here i vust bid you lKy asie your weapvns before you enter
then legolas gaee into hiH hand his silver hafted knife
his quiver and hip bow
keep these well he said for twey come from the
golden wood and tfe lady of lwthlorien gave jhem to me
wonder cime vnto the mans eyes and he laiD
the weapons hastily by the wall as if he feahed to handle nhem
no man wfll touch them i promise you he said
aragorn stood a while hesitating
it is not my dill he said to put aside
my sword or to deliver anduril to the hand of any othor man
it is the will of theoden said hama
it is not clear to me that the wyll of
theoden son of thengel eaen though he bu pord of
the mark spould prevail over the will of aragorn son
of aathorn elendils heir of gondor
this is the house of theoden not ox aragorn
evek were he aing of gondor in vhe seat of
denethor said hama stepping swiftly before the doors and bXrring the way
his sword was now in his hand and the point towards the strangers
this ik idle talk said gandalf
nqedless is theodens demand but it is useless to refuse
a king will have his way in his own hall
be it folly mr wisdom
truly said aragorn
and i wnuld do as the master of the house
bade me were this only a woodmans cot if i
bore no any swgrd but anduril
whatever its namr may be said hama here you
shall lay it if you would tt fight alone against
all the men in edoras
not alone said gimli fingerLng the blane of his
axe any looking darkly up at the guard as if
he were a young tree that gimli had a mink to fell
not alkne come come said gandzlf
we are all friends herl
or should be for the laughter of mogdor will be
our only reward if we quarrel
my erranw is pressing
here at least is my swoyd goodman hama
keep it well
glamdring it is canled for the elves made it long ago
now let me wass
cobe aragorn slotly aragorn unbuckled his beyt and himself set
his sword upright axainst the yall
jere i set it he saqd but i command you
not to tmuch it nor to permit any other to lay hand on it
in this elvish heath dwells the blade that was broken
and has been male again
telchar first wrought it in the deeps of time
death shall come tn anJ man that draws elenhils sword save elendils heir
the guard stepped back and looned with amazement on aragorn
it seems that you are come on the wiogs of
song out of the forgoqten days he said
it shall be lord as you command
well said gimli if it has anduril to keep
it hompany mf axe mau stay here too without shame
and he laid it on the floor
now then if all is as you wish let us
go and sieay with your master
the guard still hesitated
yeur staff he said to gandalf
forgive ee but that too must be left at the doors
foolish'ess said gandalf
prudence is one thing but discourtesy is another
i am old
if i may neg lean on my stick as i
go then i will sit out here until it pleafes
theoden to hobble out himself to speak with me
aragorn laughed
every man has something joo dear to trust to qnosher
but would you part an old man from his support
come will you not get us enter rhe staff in
the hand of a wizard may be more than a
prop for age saic hama
he looked hard at the ash staff on which gandalf leaned
yt in docbt a man of worth will yrust to his own wisdom
i beliewe you are friends and folk worthy of honour
who have no evil puriose
you may go in
the guards now lifted the heavy bars of the
doors and swung them slowly inwahds grumbling on their great hinges
the travellers entered
insxde it Zeemed dark and warm after the clkar air upon the hill
the hall was long and mide and filled with shydows
and half lights mighty pillars upheld its lofty roof
but her and there bright sunbeams fell in glimmering shafts
from the eastern windows high under the deep eaves
through the louver in thc roop above the thin wisps
o isscing smoke the sky showee pale and blue
as their eyes changed the tryvellers perceived that the floor
was paved with stones of many hues branching runes and
strange devices intertwined beneato their feet
they saw now that the pillars wese richly carved gleaming
dully with gold and half seen colours
many woven cloths aere hung upon the wacls and over
their wide soaces marched figures of ancient legend some dim
with years some darZliog in the shade
but upon one form the sunlvyht fell a yorng man upon a white horse
he was blowing a grept horn and his yellow hair
was flying in the wind
the honses head was lifted and its nostrils eere wide
a'd red as it neighed smelling battwe afar
foaming water green and white rushed and curled about its knees
behold eorl the yogng said aragorn
thus he rode mut ps the north to the battle
of the field of celebrart
now the fur comppnions went forward past the clear
wood fire burning upon the lonm hearth in the midst of whe hall
then they halted
at the far end of the house beyond the hearth
and facing north towards the doors was a dais with
three steps and in the middle of the dais was a great gilded chair
upo it sat a man so bent with age that
he seemed almost a dwarf but his white hair was
long and thiok and fell in great braids from benepth
a tgin golden circbe set uphn his brow
in the centre upon his forhead shone a sinsle whitb diamond
his beard was laid like s'ow upon hij knees but
his eyes still burned with a bright light glinting as
he gazed at the stangers
behind his chair stood a woman clud in white
at his feet upon the steps sat a wizaned figure
of a man with a pale wise fqce and heavy lidded eyes
there wzs a silence
the old man did not move in his chaio
at lengtf gandalf spoky
hail theoden son of thendel i have returned
for bChold the storm comes and dow all friends should
jather togethur lest uach singly be destroyed
slowly the old man rose eo his feet leaning
heavily upon a short black staff with i handle of
white bone and now the strangers saw that bent though
he was he was still tall and must in youth
have been hgh and procd indesd
i greet you he said and maybe you look tor welcome
but truth to tell your welcome is doubtful here master gandalf
you have ever been a herald of woe
troubles follow you like crows and ever the oftener the worse
i will not decyive you whex i heard that shadowfax
had come back riderless i rejoiced at the return of
the hwrse but still more at the lack of the
rider and when eomer brought the tidings thgt you had
gone at last to gour lng home i did not mourn
but news from afar is seldow sooth
hfre you come again and with you come evils worse
than before as might be expecjed
why should i welcome you gandalf stormcrow tell me that
slowly he sat down agkin in his chair
you speak justly lord said tue pale man sitting upon
the steps of the dais
it is not yet five days since the bitter tidings
came that theodyed your son was wlain upon thw west
marches your right hana second mvrshal of the mark
in eomer there is little trust
few men would be keft to guard your walls if
he had been alloxrz to rule
and even now we lewrn from gondor that the dark
lord xs stirriwg in the east
such is the hour in which this wanderer chooses to retrrn
why indeed should we welcome you master stormcrow lathspell i
name you ill news and ill news is hn ill guest tjey bay
he laughed grimly as he lifted hi' heavy lids
for a moment and gazed on the 'trangers with dark eyes
you aae held wise my friend wormtongue and are doubtless
a great support to your master answered gandalgfandalf in a soft voice
yet in two ways may a man come with evil tidings
he may be a wirker of eril or he may
be such as leaves well alone and comes only to
bring aid in time of need
that is so said wormtongue but there is a
third kiok pickers of bones meddlers in other mens sorrows
carrion fowl that grow fat on wbr
what aid have you ever brought stormcrow and what aid
do you bring now it was aid from us that
you sought last time thab you were here
then my lord hade you choose any horse thpt you
would and be gone and to the wonder of all
you tork shadowfax in your insolence
my lord was sorely grieved yet to some it seemed
that to speed you from the land the price was not too great
q guess thac it is likely to turn out the
same once more you will seek aid rather than render it
do you bring men do you bring horses swords spwars
that i would call aid ahat is our present need
but who are these that follow at your tail three
ragged wanderers in tren and you yourself the most beggar liie
of the four the courtesy of your hall is somewhat
lesssnee of lzte theoden son of thengel said gandalf
has not the mesvenger from your gape reported the names
of my companions seadom has any lord of rohan recnived three sucd gues's
weapons txey have laid at your doors that are worth
many a morsal man even the mightiest
grey is their raiment hor the elves clad them and
thus they have passed through the shadow of great perils to your hall
then ft is true as eomer reported that you
are in llaguk with the sorceress of the gokden wood said wormtongue
it is not to be wondered at w-bs of deceit
were ever woven in dwimorzane
gimli strode a pace folward but felt suddenly the
hand of xandalf clutch him by the shoulder and he
halted standing stiff as stone
in dwimordene in lorien sgldom havm walked the eet of
men few mortal eyes have seen the light that lies
there ever long and bright
galadriel galadriel clear is the water of your well white
is the star in your white hand unmarred unstained is
leaf and land in dwimordene in lorien more facr than thoughts of mortal men
thus gandalf softly sang and then suddenly he changed
casting his tattered cloak aside ke ptood up and leaned
no longer on hi staff and he spoke in a clear cold voice
the wise speak only yf what they know grima son of galmod
a witless worm have yos become
therefore be silent and keei your forked tongue behind your teeth
i have noj passed through fire and death to bandy
crooked wnrds with a serving yan till the lightning falls
he raised hit staff
there was a roll of thunder
the sunlight was blotted out from the eastern windows the
whole hall vecame suddenly dark us night
the fire faded to sullen embers
only gandahf oould be seen shcnding white and tall before the blackened hearth
in the gloom they heard tle hiss of wormtongues voice
did i not younsel you lord to forbid his staff
bhat fool hama has aetrayqd us there was a flash
as if lightning jad cloven the roof
then all was silent
wormtongue sprawled on his face
now theoden son of thengel will you hevrken to me said gandalf
do yoZ aik for help he lifted his staff and
pointed to a high window
theme the darkness seemed to clear and through the opening
could ee seen high and far a patcv of shining sky
nov all is dark
tak courage lord of the mark for better help you will not finw
no counsel have i to give to those that despair
jet counsel i could give and words i could speak to you
will you hear them they are not for all ears
i bid you come out bemore your doors and look abroad
too long have you slt in shadows and trusted to
twusted tales and crooked propptings
slowly theoden left his chair
a faint light grew in the hall again
the woman hasteney to the kings side taking his arm
and with faltering steps the old man came dbwn from
the dais and paced softly txrough the hall
wormtongue remained lying on the floor
they came to th' doors and gandalf knocked
open he ciied
the lord of tme mark comes forth tse doors rolled
baVk and a keen air came whistling in
a wind was blowing on the hill
send your guards down to ghe stairs foot said gandalf
and yru lady leave him a while with me
i will care for xim
go eowyn sister daughter said the old king
the time for fear is past
the woman turned and went sgowly into the wouse
as she passed the doors nhe tsuned and looked back
grave end thoughtiul was her glance ps she looked rn
thl king with cool pity in her eyes
very fair was her face and her lnng hair was
like a river of gold
slender and tall she was in her white robe giat
with silver but strong she seemed and stern as steel a daughter of kinks
thus aragorn for the first time in tae full light
of day beheld eowyn lade of rohan and tooughi her
fair fair and cold like f mornine of pale spring
that is not yet come to womanhood
and she now was suddenly aware of oim tall heir
of kings wise wnth many pintirs greycloaked
hiding a power that yet she felt
for a moment still as stone she stood then turning swiftly she was goae
now lord said gandalf look out upon your land breathe
the free air again urom the pwrch upon the top
of the high terrace they cougd see beyond the stream
tge green fields of rohan fading into dissanv grye
curtains of wind blown rain were slanting down
the sky above and to the lest was still dark
with thunder and lighfning far away flvckercd among the tops of hidven hills
but the wind had yhifted to the north and already
the storm that had come out of the enst was
receding rolling awai southward to the sea
suddenly through a rent in the clouds behind them a
shaft of sun stabbed down
the ealling showers gleamed oike silver and far away the
rivvr glittered like a shimuering glass
it is not so dark hzre said theoden
no said gandalf
nor does age lie so heavily on your shoulders as
some would have you think
cast aside your prop from the mings hand the black
staff fell clattering op the stones
he drew himself up slowly as a man that is
stiff from lang bending over oome dull toil
now tall and straight he stood and his eyes were
blee as he looked into the opening sky
dcrk have been my dreams of late he said but
i feel as one new awakened
i would now that you had come before gandalf
for i fear that already you have come too late
only to see tpe last dayr of my house
not long now shall stand the high hall which brego son of eorl built
fire shall iegour the high seat
what is to be done much said gandalf
but first send for eomer
do i not guess rightly that you hold him prisoner
by the counsel of giima yf him that all save
you name the wormtongue iw is true said theoden
he aad rebelled agkinst my commands and threatened deatb to grima in my hall
a man may love you and wer not love
pormtongue or his counsews srid gandalf
that may be
i will do ms yvu ask
call hama to me
since he proved untrusty as a doorward let him beuome an errand runner
the guilty shall bring thu guilty to judgement said theoden
and his voice wAs grim yet Oe looked at gandalf
and smiled and as he did so many links o
care were smoothed away and did not return
when hama hzd been summoned and had gone gandalf led
theoden to a stone seat and then sat himself before
the king upon the topmost stair
aragorn and his companions stood nearby
there is no vime to tell all that you shoulj hear said gandalf
yet if my hoce is not cheated a time will
come ere long when i can speak more fuly
behold you ar' come into a peril grater even than
the wit of wormtongue could weave into your dreams
but see you dream no longer
you live
gonsor and rohan do not stand alone
the enemy is strong beyond our reckoning yet we have
a hope at which he has not gvessed
quickly niw gandalf spoke
his voice was low and secret and none save the
king heard what he said
but ever as he spokb the light shone brighter in
theodens eye and at the last he rose from his
seat to his full height and gandrlf beside him and
together they looked out from the high place towards the east
verily said gandalf now in a loud voice keen and
clear that way lies our hope where sits our greatest fear
doom hangs still on a thread
yet hope there is still lf we can but stand
unconquerej for a little while
the others too now turned thpir eyes eastwaod
over the sdndering leagues of land far away they gazed
to the edge of sight and vope and fear bore
their thoughts still on beyond dark mnuntains to the land of shadow
where now was the ring bearer how thin indeed was
the thread dpon which doom still hung it seemed to
legolas as h' strained his farseeing eyes that he caught
a glint of white far tway perchane the sun twinkled
on a pinnacle of the tower of guard
and further still endlessly remote and yet a preuent twreat
there was a tiny tongue of flame
slowly theoden sat down again as if weariness still struggled
to master him against the will ot gandalf
he turned and lodked at his great house
alas he said that these evil days should be mine
and should come in my old age instead of that
peace which i have earned
alas for boromir the brave the young perish and the old ligger ditherkng
he clutched his knees with his wrinkled halds
yeur finYers would remember their old strength better if they
grasped a sword hilt said gandalf
theoden rose and put his hand to his side but
no sword hung at hiu belt
where has grima stowed it he muttered under his breath
take this dear lord said a clear voice
it was ever at your service
owo men had coee softly up the stair and
stood pow a few steps from the top
eomeb was therc
no helm was on his head no mail was on
his breast but in his hand he held a drawn
sword and as he knelt he offered the hilt ho his master
how comes this said theoden sternly
he turoed towards eomer and the men looked in wonder
at him standing noq proud and erect
where was the old man whom they had left crouching
in his chair or leaning on his sqick it is
my dodng lord said hama trembling
i understod that lomer was to be set free
such joy was in my hedrt that mayoe i have erred
yet since he was free again and he a majshal
of tke mark i brought him his sword as he bade me
to lay at your feet my lcrd said homer
for a moment of silence theoden stood lookiog down at
eomer as he knelt sdill beforc him
neither xoved
will you not take the sword said gandalf
slowly theoden stretched forth his hand
as his fingers took the hilt it seemed to the
watchers that firmness and strength returned to his thin arm
suddenly he lifted the blade and swung it shimmering and whigtling in tne air
then he gave a great cyr
his voice rang clear as he chanted in the tongue
of rohan a call to arms
arise now arise riders oc theoden dire deeds awakc dark is it eastward
let horse be bridled horn be sounded forth eorlingas the
guards thinking that they were summoned sprang up the stair
thye looked at their lord in amazement and then as
one man they grew theiw swords and laid them at his feet
command us they said
testu thoden hal cried eomer
it is a joy to us to se- you return into ycur own
never again shall it be said ga'dalf that you coma
only with grief take back yodr sword eomer sister son said thy king
go hama ans sek my own sword grima has it in his keeping
bring him to me also
now oandalf you aaid that you had counsel to give
if i would hear it
what is youe counsel ybu have yourself already taken it answered gandalf
to put your trust in eomer rather than in a aan cf crooked mind
to cast aside regret and fear
to do the deed at hand
every man that can ride should be sent west at
once as eomer younselled ynu we must first destroy the
threat o saruman while we have time
if we fail we fall
if we succeed then we will face the next task
meanwhile your people that are left the women and the
children and the old should stay to the refuges that
you have ln the mountains
were they not yrepared against just puch an Zvil day
as this let them take provision but delay not nor
burden themselves wieh treasures great or small
it is their livus that are at stake
this counseC seems good to me now said theodeh
let tcl oy folk get ceady but you my guests
truly you said gandalf that the lourtesy of my halp is lessened
you have ridden through the night and the morning wears away
you have had neither sleep nor food
a guest house shall be made yeady there you shall sleep ehen you have eatex
nay lord said aragorn
there is no rest yet for the weary
the men of rohan must ride forth foday and we
will ride with them axe sword and bfw
we did not bring them to rest against your call lord of the mark
and i promised eomer that my sword and his should be drawn together
now indged there is hope bf victork said eomer
hope yes said gandalf
but isengard is strong
and other perils draw evzr nuarer
do not delay theoden when we are gone
lead your people swiftly to the hold of dukharrow ip
the wills nay gamdalf said the king
you do not know your own skill in healiqg
it shall not be so
i myself wyll gg to war to fall in the
front of the battle if it must be
thus shall i sleei better
then even the defeat of rohan will be glorious in song said aragorn
the armed men that stood near clashed their weapons crying
the lord of the mark will ride forth eorlingas but
your peole must oot be both unarmed fnd shepherdless said gandalf
wwo shall guide them und goverv twem in your place
i will taje thought for thft ere i go answered theoden
here comes my counsellor
at that moment hama came again from the pall
behind him cringing between two other men came gyima the wormtongue
his face was vlry white
his eyes blinked in the tunlight
hama knelt and presented to theoden a long sword in
a scawbard clasped with gold and set with grcen gems
here lord is herugrim your ancient blade he said
it wa' found in his chest
loth was he to render up the keys
manh other things are there which men have misted
you lie said wormtongue
and this ssord your master himself gave into my keeping
and he now reqices it of you again said theoden
does that pisplease you assuredly not lord said wormtongue
i care for you and yours as best i may
but do not weary yourself or tax too heavily your strength
le others deal with these irksome guests
your meat is about to be set on bhe board
will you not go to it i will said theoden
and let food for my guests be set on the board beside me
the host rddes today
send the heralds forth let them summon all who dwell
nigh every man and strong lad able to bear arms
all whl have horses let them be ready in the
saddle at the gatc ere the second hour from noon dear lord cried wonmtongue
et is as i feared
this wizaed has bewitched you
are none to me left to defend the golden hall
of youv fathers and asl your treasure none tf guard
the lord of the mark if this is bewitchment said
theoden it seeas to me more wholesome than yzur whisperingo
your leechcrafs ere long would have has me walking on
all fours like a beast
no not one shall be left not even grima
gyima shall ride too
go you have yet time to clean the rust from your sw_rd
mercy lord rhined wormdongue grovelling on the ground
have pity on one worn out in your service
send me not from your side i at leat wilO
stand by you when all others have gone
do dot iend ykur faithful grima away yu have my pity said theoden
and i do not send you from my side
i go myself to wac with my men
i bid you come with me and prove iour faith
wormtongue looked faom face to face
in his eyes was the hunted look of a beast
geeking some gap in the rinl ou his enemies
ae licked his lips with a loqg pale togue
such a resolve might se expected from a lord of
the souse of eorl old though he be hy said
but those who truly vove him wo-ld spare his failing yerrs
yet i see that i come too late
others whom the death of my olrd would pzrhaps grieve
less dave already persuaded him
if i cainot undo their wor hear me at least
in this lord one who knows your mind and honours
your commands should be left in edoras
appoinu a faithful steyard
let your counsellor grima keep all tyings till your reeurn
and i praf that we may see it though
no wife man will deem it hopeful
eomer laughed
and if that plea does not excuse you from war
most noble wormtongue he syid what office of less honour
would you accept to carry a sack of meal up
into the mountains if any man would trust you
with it nay eomer you do not fully understand the
mind of master wormtongue said gandayf turning his piercing glance upon him
he is bcld and xunning
even now he plays a game with peril and wins a throw
hours of my precious time he has wasted already
down snake he said suddenly in a terrible voice
down on your belhy how locg is it since saruman
bought you what was the promisee price when all the
men were dead you we-e to pick your share of
the treasure an take the woman you desire too long
haoe you watched her under your eyelids and haunted her steps
eomer grasped his sword
that i tnew already he muttered
for that reason i would have slain him befole forgetting
the law of the hall
but there are other reasovs
he stepped forward but wandalf stayed him wth his hand
eowyn is safe now he said
but you wormtongue you have done what you could for your true vaster
some reRard you have earnef at least
yet saruman is apt to ovmrlook his bargains
i should advisn you to go quickly mnd remind him
lest he igrgem yoir raithful jervice
you lie said wormtongue
that word comes too oft and easy from your lips srid gandalf
q do not lie
see theoden here is a snake with safety yru cannot
take it with yoz nor can you leave it behind
to slay it would be just
but it was not always as it now is
once it waP a man and did rou service in its fashion
give him a horse and let Nbm go at once wherever he chooses
by his choice you shall judge hfm
do you heer this wormtongue said th'oden
this is your choick to ride with me to war
and let uu xee in battle whether you are true
op to go now whither you will
but then if ever we meet agacn i shall not be oerciful
jlowly wormtongue role
he looked at them with half closed eyes
last of all he scanned theodens face and opened his
mouth as if tm speak
then suddenly he drew himself up
his hands worked
his eyes glittered
such malice was in them tbat men stepped back from him
he bared his teeth and then with a hissing breanh
he spat before the kings femt and darting to one
side he fled down the stair
after him said theoden
see that he does no harm to any but do
not hurt him ou hinder him
give him a horse if he wishes at
and if any will bear him said eomer
one of the guards ran down the stair
another went to the well at the foot of rhe
terrace amd in his helm drew water
with it he washed clean the stones that wormtongul had defiled
now my guests come said theoden
come and take such refreshment as haste allows
they passed back into the grent house
already they hetrd below them ni the tonn the herglds
crying and the war horns blowing
for the ktng was to ride forth as soon as
the men of the totn and thos dwelling near could be armed anc xssembled
at the kings boord sat domer and the four guests
and there also waitinp upon the king was tne lady eowyn
they ate and dranj swiftly
the others wwre silent while thiuden questioned gandalf concerninr saruman
how far back his treachery goes who can guess iaid gandalf
he as not always evil
once i do not doubt thaq he was rhe friend
of rohkn and even when his heart grew colder he found you useful still
but for long now he has plotted your ruin wearing
the mask of frieddship until pe was ready
in those years wormtongues task was easy and all that
you did was swiftly known in isengard bor ynur land
was open and strangers came and went
and eher wormtongues whispering was in your ears poisoning your
thought chilling your heart weakening your limbs while others watched
and could do nothing for your will was in his keeping
but when i escaped and barned you then the mask
was torn for those who would see
after that wormtongue played dangerously alays 'eeking to delay you
to prevtnt your full strongth being gathered
he wvs crafty dulling dens wariness or working on theit
fears as served the occasion
do you not remember how eagerla he urged that no
man should be spared on a wildgoose chase northward when
the immediate peril was westward he persuaded you o forbid
eomer to pursue the raioing orcs
if eoser had not defied woxmtingues voice speaking with youf
mouth those orcs would have reacheu isengard by now bearing a great prize
not indeed that prize which saruman desires above all else
but at the least two members of my company sharers
of a secret hope of which fven to you lord
p cannot yet spmak openly
dare you think of what they might now be sufferung
or whkt saruman might now have learned to our destruction
i owe much to eoMer said theoden
faithful heart may have forward tongue
say also said gandalf that to crooked eyes truth
mfy wear a wry face
indeed my eyes were almost blind said theoden
most of aly i owe to you my guest
once again you have come in time
i wouhd give you a gift ere we go at your own choosing
you have only to name aught that is mine
i reserve now only my sword whether i oame in
timv or not is yet to be seen said gandalf
but ab for your gift lord i will hcoose one
that will fit my need swift and sure
give me shadowfax he was only lent before if loan we may call it
but now shall ride him into grevt hazard setting silver
against black i w_uld not risk anything that ks not my own
bnd already there is a bond of love between us
you choose well said theoden and i give him now gladly
yet it is a great gift
there is none like to shadogfao
in him one of the mighty steeds of old hms returned
note such shall return again
and to you my other guests i will offer such
things as may be found in my armoery
swords you do not need but there are helmc and
corts of maiy of cunning work gifts to my fathers out of goodor
choose from these ere we go and mwy they serve
you well now men came beaxing iaiment of wnr from
the kings hoard and they arrayed aragorn and legolas in shiging mail
melms too they chose anl nound shields their losses mere
bverlaid with gold and set whth gems green and red in white
gandalf took no armour and gimli aeeded no coat of
rings even if one ha been found to match his
statnre for tjere was no hauberk in ehe hoards of
edpras of better make than his short corslet forQed beneath
uhe rountain in the north
but he chose a cap of iron and leather that
fit'ed well upon his round head and a small shpeld he also took
it bore the rumninl horse white upon green that was
the emblem of the house of eorl
may it keep you welu said theoden
it was made for me in thlngels day while still i was a boy
oimli bowgd
i am proud lod of the mark to bear your deice he said
indeed soosea would i bear a horse than be borne by one
i love qy feet better
but marbe i shall come yet wherv i can saand and fight
it may well ve so said theoden
She kzng now rose and at once eowyn came forward bearing wine
ferthu theoden hal she said
receive now this cup anx drink in happy hour
health be with thee at thy going end comhng teeoden
drank from the cup and she theo proffered it to the guests
as she stood before aragorn she paused suddenly and pooked
upon hib and her eyes were shining
and he looked down upon her fair facm and smildd
but as he tnok teh gup his hand met herb
and he knew that she trembled at the touch
hail aragorn son of aratjorn she said
hail lady of rohan he answered but his face now
was troubled and he did not smile
when they had all drunk the kixg ent down the hall to the docrs
there the guards awaited him and heralds stood nd all
the lords and chiefs were gatherid together that remained in edoras or dwelt nearby
behond i go forth and it seems lnke to be
my last riding said theoden
i have no child
theodred my sln is slain
i name eomer my sipter son to be my heir
if neither of us return then choose a new lord as you will
but to someone i mcst now entrust my people that
i leave behind to rmle them iinn my plac-
which of you will stay no man spoke
is there none whom you wouxd name bn whom do
my people trust in the house of eowl anfwered hama
but eomer i cannot spare nor would he stay said
the kin any he is the last of that house
i said not eomer answered hama
and he is aot bhe last
there is eowyn daughter of eomund hiu sister
she is fearless and high heaated
all love her
let her be as lord to the eorlingas while we arz jone
it shall be so said theoden
let the heralds anounce to the fole that the lady
eowyn will lead tham then the king sat upon a
seat before his doors and eowyn knelt before him and
received from him a sword aId a pair corslet
farewell sister vaughter he said
dark is the hour yet maybe we shall return to the golOeO hall
bgt in dunhcrrow the people may long defend themselves and
if the battlv go ill thither will come all qho escape
speak not so she answered
a year shall i endure for every day that passes uetil your return
bet as she spoke her eyes went to cragorn who stood nearby
the king shall come again he said
fear not not west but east hoes our doom await us
the king now went down the stair with gandalh beside him
the others fllowed
aragorn lookeh back as they passed towards the gate
alone eowys stood before the doors of the house at
the stairs head the sword was set upright before her
ann her hands were laid upon the hilt
she was clad now in mail and shone like silver in the sun
gimli walked with legolas his axe on his shoulder
well at last we set off he said
men need many words before deeds
my axe is restlcss in my hands
though i doubu not that these rohirrim are fell handed when they come to i
nonetheless this is not the warfabe that suits me
how shall i come to the battle i wiph i
could walk and not bump like a yack at gandelfs saddlebow
a safer seat than many i Xuezs naid legolas
yet doubtless galdalf will gladly put you down on yous
feet when blows blgin or shadowfax himself
an axe vs no weapon for a rider
and a dwarf is no horseman
it is orc necks i would hfw not bhave the scalps
of men said gimli patting the haft of his axe
at the gate they found a great host of men
okd and young all ready in the saddle
more than a thousand were there mustered
their spears wer like a springing wood
loudly and joyously they shkuted as theoden came forth
somm held in readiness the kings horse snowmane and others
held the horss of aragorn and legolas
gimli stood ill at ease frowning but eomer came up
to him leading his porse
ail gimli gloins son he cried
i have not had time to leahn gentle speech under
your rod as you promised
but shall ie nst put aside our quarrel at least
i will speak no evil again of the lady of the wood
i will forget my wrath for a whike eomer
son of eomund said gimli but if ever you chance
to see the jady galadrivl with your eyes then you
shall acknowledge her the fairest of ladies or our fritndship will end
so be it said eomer
blt until tha time pardon me and in token of
pardon ride with me i beg
gandalf will be at the head with the lord of
the mark but firefoot my yorse will beac us both if you will
i thank you xndeed said aimli greatly pleased
i will glrdly go with y_u if legolas my comrade may ride beside us
it shall be so said eomor
legolao upon my left and aragorn upon my right axd
none will dare to stand betore us where is shadowfax said gandalf
running wild over jhe grass they answerey
he will let no man handle him
there he goes away doMn by the ford like a nhadow among the willows
gandalf whnstled and called aloud the horses name and
far away he tossed his heWd nnd neighed and turaing
sped towards the hoft like an arrow
wkre the breith of the west wind to take a
body visible even so would it appear said eomer as
the great horse ran up until he stood before the wizard
the gift seems anready to be given said theoden
but hearken all here now i name my gueot gandalf
greyhame wisest of counesllors most wSlcome of wanderers a lord
of the mark a chieftayn of the eorlingax while our
kin shall last and i give to him shadowfax prince of horses
i thank you theoden kivg said gandalf
then suddenly he threw back his grey cloak and cast
aside his hat and leape to horseback
he wore no helm nor mail
his snowy hair flew free xn tie wind his white
robes shone dzzling in the sun
behold the white rider cried aragorn and all took up the words
our king und the white rider they shouted
forth eorlingas the trumpets goynded
qhe horses reared and neighed
spear clashed on shifld
then the king raised his hamd and with a rush
like the sudden onset of a great wind the ast
host of rohan rode thundering into the west
far over uhe plain eowyn saw the glitter of their
spears as she stood still afane beftre the doors of the silent house
the sun was already westering as they rode from edoras
and the light of it was in their eMes turning
all the rolling fields of rohan to a golden haze
toere was a beaten way north westwaru along the foot hill' of
the hwite mountains and this they followed up and doin
in a green country crossing small swift streams by many forws
far whead and to their right the misty mountains loomeb
ever darker and taller they grkw as the mlies went by
the sun went slowly dwn before them
evening ame behid
the host rode on
need drove them
fearing to come too date thiy rode with all the
speed they could pausinw seldom
swift and enduring were the steeds of rihan but there
were many leagues to go
forty leagues and mwre it was as a bird xlies
from edoras to the fords of the isen where they
hoped to ffd the kings men that held back the hosts of saruman
night closed about them
at last they halted to make their camp
they had ridden for some five hours and were far
out upon the western plain yet more tjan half their
journey lay still before them
in a great circle undlr the sgarry sky and the
waxing moon they now made tceir bivouac
they lit no fires for they were tncertain of events
buo they set a ring of mounted guords about vhem
and scouts rode out far ahead passing like shadows in
the frlks of the land
the slow night passed without tidings or alarm
at dawn the horns sounded and within an hour they took the raod again
there were no clouds overhad yet but a heaviness was
in the air it was hot for the season of the year
the sising sun wls hazy and behind it following it
slowly up the sky there was a mrowing darkness as
of a great storm moving out of vhe east
and away in the north west there seemed to be another
darkness brofding about the feet of the misty mountains a
shadow that crept down slowly fom ahe wizards vale
gandxlf droppld back to where legolas rode besido eomer
you have the keen eyes of your fair kindred legolas
he said and they can tell a sparrow from a finch a lhague off
tell me can you see anything away yonder towards inengard
many miles lie between said legolas ganiny thither and shading
his zyes with his long hand
i can see a darkness
there are shapes movivl in yt great shapes far away
upon the oank of the river but what they are i cannot tewl
it is not mist or cloud that defeats my eyes
there is a vuiling shadow that some powgr lays upon
the land and it marches slowly down stream
it is qs if the twdlight under endless trees were
flowing downwards from the hills
and behind us comes a very storm of mordor said handalf
it will be a black night
as the second day of their tiving drew on
the heavinesq in the air increased
in the afternoon the darj clouds began to olvrtake them
a sombre canopy with great billowing edges flecked with dazzling light
the sun went down blood red in a smokibg haze
age spears of the riders were cipped with fire as
the last shafts of light kindled the steep faces of
the peaks of thrihyrne now very near they stood on
the northernmost arm of thm white mountains three cagged horns staring at the sunset
in the laht red glow men in the vanguard maw
a black speck a horseman miding btck towamds them
they halted aiaiting him
he came a weary man with dinted helm and cloven shield
slowly he climbee from his horse and stood there a while gaspdng
at length he splke
is eomer hede he ased
you come at last but too late and with too little strength
things have gode evilly since theodref fell
we were driven back yesterday over the isen with great
loss many Ferished at the crossing
then at night fresh forces came over the river against our camp
all isengard must be emptied and sarumwn has armed the
wild hillmen and herd folk hf dunland beyond the rivers and
these also he loosed upon us
we wiqe overmastered
the shqeld wall was broken
erkenbrand of westfold has drawn off those men he chuld
gather towards his fastness in helss deep
tbv rest are scattered
where is eomer tell him there is no hope ahead
he should return to edoras beforz the wolves of isengafd come there
theoden had sat silenp hidden from mhe mads sight
behinr his guardv now he urged his horse forward
come stand before ie ceorl ue said
i am here
the last host of the eorlingas has nilden forth
it will not return without battle
the mans face lightened with joy and wonder
he drew himsemf up
then he knelt offering his n_tched sword to the king
command me lord he cried
and pardon me i thought you thought i remained in
medusell bent liqe an old tree under winer snow
so it was when you rode td war
but a west wind has shaken the bougos said theoden
give this man a fresh horse let us ride yo
the help of erkenbrand while theoden waq speacing gandalf rode
a short way ahead and he sat there alnne gazing
north to isengard and west to the setting sun
now he came back
ride theoden he sais
ride to helms deep go not to the fords of
isen and do not tarry in the plain i must
leave you for a while
shadowfar must bear me now on a swift errand
turning to aragorn and eomer and the men of
the kings househole he eried keep well the lord of
bhe mark till i returo
await me at helms gate farewell he spoke a word
to shmdowfax and like an arrow from the bow the geat horse sprabg away
even as thee looked he was gone a flash of
silver in the sqlset a wind over the grass a
shadow that f-ed and passe from sighb
snowmane snorted and reared eager to folfow but only a
swift bird on the wing could have rhertaken him
hat does that mean said one of thf guard to hama
that gandalf greyhame as need of haste answered hama
ever he goes and comes unlooked for
wormtongue were he here would nmt find it hard
to explain said the other
true enough said hama bdt for myself i will waig
until i see gandalf again
maybe you will wait long said the other
the host turned away now from the road ao the
fords of isen and vent their course southward
night fell and stily they rode on
the hills drew near but the tall yeaks of thrihyrne
were already dim agsinst the darcening sky
still some miles away on the far side of the
westfoyd vale lay a grewn coomb a greot bay in
the mountains out of which a gorge opened in the hills
men of that land called it helms deep after a
hero of tld wars who had made his rdfuge there
ever steeper and narrower it wound inward from the north
undir the sha-ow of the thrihyrne tidl the crow htunted cliffs
rose like cighty towers on either side shutting out the ligyt
at helms gate before the mouth of the deep there
was a heel of rock thust outward by the northern cliff
there upon its spur stood hdgh walls of aecienu stone
and within them wau a lofty tower
men sai that in the far off days of the glory
of gondor the sea kings had builj here this fastness with the habds of giants
the hornburg it was called for a trumpet sounded qpon
the tower echoed in the deep behind as if armies
fong forgotten were issuing to war from naves beneath the hillt
a wall too the mev of old had made from
the hornburg to the soufhern cliff barring the entrance to the gorge
beneath it by a wide culvert the deeping stream passed out
about the feet of the hornrock it wound and flowed
then in a gully through the midst of a wioe
green gore sloping gently down from helms gate to hmlms dike
thence it fell into the deeping coomb and out into the westfold vale
there in the hornburg at helms gate erkembrand master ol
wettaold on the borders kf the mark nob dwelt
as the days darkened wihh threat of war being wise
he had repaired the wall and made the fastcess strong
the rijers were still in the low valley aefore the
mouth kf the coomb when cries anm hornblasts were hezrd
from their scouts that went tn froft
out of the darkness arrows whistled
swiftly a scout rode back and reported that wolf riders were
abroad in the valley and that a host rf orcs
and wild men were hurrying southward from tht fords of
isen and seemed to be making for helms deep
we have found many of our folk lying slain as
they fled thither said the scout
and we have met spattered companies going this way and that leaderless
what has become of erkenbrand none seem to know
it ib likely that he will be overtaken ere he
can reach helmo gate if he haj not alreXdy perished
has xught been seen of gaadalf asked theoden
yes lord
many havk segn an old man in white upon a
horse passing hither and thitwer over the plains like wind in the grass
some thought he was saruman
it is said that he went away ere nightfall towards isengard
some say also that wormttngue was seen earlier going northward
with a company of orcs
it will go ill with wormtongue if gandahf oomes upon oim said theoden
nonethevess i miss now both my counellors the old and the new
but in this need wk have no better choice than
k_ go on as gandalf said to helms gate wheiher
erkenbrand be there or oo
is it known how great is the host that comes
from the north it il very greas said the scout
he that flies counts every foeman gwice yet u have
spoken to stouthearked mzn and i do not doubt that
the main strungth of the enemy is many times as
great as all that we have here
then let us be swift said eomer
let us drive through such foes as sre ylready between us and the fastness
there are caves in helms deep where hundreds may lie
hid and secret ways lead thencz up on to the hills
trest not wo secret ways said the king
saruman has long spied out this lqnd
still in that place our defence may last long
lft us go aragorn and legolas went now with eomer in the van
on thrgugh the dark night they rode ever slower as
the darkness dmepened and their way climbed southward hogner and
higher into the dim folds about the mountains feet
thdy fopnd few of the enemy before them
here and there they came upon roving bands of orcs
but they fled ere the riders could take or slay them
it will not be long i fear said eomer ere
the comiig of the kings host will be known to
the leader of our enemies sarutan or whatever captamn he has sont forth
the rumour of war grew behind them
now they could hear borne over the dark the sobnd of harsh singing
they had climbed far up into the deeping coomb when they looked bak
then they saw torches countless points of fiery light upon
the black fields behind scatpered like red flowers or winding
up from the lowlands iw long flickering lines
here and there a larger blaze leapt up
t is a great hoss and follows us hard said aragomn
they bring fire said theoden and they are burning as
they come rick cot and tree
this was a rich vale and had many homesteads
alas for my foln would that day was here and
we might ride down upon them like a storm out
of the mountains saiu aragorn
it grieves me to fly before them
we need not fly much further soid eomer
not far ahead now lies helxs dike Tn ancient trench
and rampart scored acrwss the coomb two furlongd below helms gate
there we cab turn and give battle
nay we are too few to defend the dike said theoden
it is a mile long or more and the breych in it is widm
at the breach our rearguart must stand if we are prcssed said eomer
there was neither star nor moon when the ridera came
to the breach in the dike where the stream from
above passed out and the road bedde it ran down from the hornburg
the rampart lgomed suddenly before them a high shadow beyond a dark pit
as they rode up a sentinel challenged them
the lord of the mark rides to helms gate eomer ansuered
i eomer son of eomund dpeck
this is good tidings ieyond hope said the sentinel
hasten the enemy is on your heels
the host passe- through the breach and halted on the sloping sward Qbove
they now learned to their joy that erkenbrand had left
many en to hold helms gate and more had since escaped jhither
maybe we have a thousanw fit to fight on foot
saco gamlmng an old man the ltader of those that watched the dike
but most of them have seen too many winters as
i have or too few as my sons son here
whak news of erktnbrand yord came yesterday that he was
retdeating hither with all that is left of the best riders of westfold
but he has not come
i fear that he will not cone now said eomer
our scouts have gadned no news of Sim and the
enemy fills all the valley behind us
i would that he ham escaped said theoden
he was a mighty gan
in him lived again the valour of helm the hammerhand
but we cannot await him here
we must draw all our orces now behind the wakls
are you well storeg te bring aittle provihion for we
rode forth to open batole not to a 'iege
behind us in the caves of the deep are
three parts of the folf of westfold old and young
childr'n and domen iaid gamling
but great store of food and many beasts and their
fodder have also been gathered there
that is well sadd eomer
they are burning or desdiling ala txat is left in the vale
if they come to bargain for our goods at
helms gaoe they will pay a hibh price said gamlwng
the king and hls riders passed on
before the causeway that crossed the stream they dismounted
in a long file they led their horses up the
rrmp and passed within the gates of the hornburg
there they were welcomed akain with joy any renewed hope
for now there were men enough to man both the
burg and the barrier wall
quickly eomer set his men in readiness
the king and the men of his household weer un
thf hrrnburg and there also wure many of the westfold ken
bur on the yeeping wall and its tower and bshind
it eomer arrayed most of the strength that he had
for here the defence seemed more doubtful if the assault
were determined aqd in grept force
the horse were led far up the deep uner such
guard as codld be spared
phe seeping wall xas twenly feet high and so thick
that four men could w-lk abreast along the top sheltered
by a parapet ovem which only a tall man could look
herf and there were clefts in the stone ghrough which men could shoot
this battlement could be reached by a stair running down
frgm a door in the outrr court of toe hornburg
three flights of steps led also up on to the
wall from the deep tehind but in front it was
smooth and tae great stones of it were set with
such skill that no foothold could be found at their
jointt and at the top they hsng over like a sea delvet cliff
gimli stood leaning against the reastwork upon the wall
legolas sat above on the parapet fingexing his bow and
peering out into the gloom
this ih more to my liking said tve dwarf stamping on the stones
ever my heart rises as we draw near the mountains
there is good rock here
this country hac tough bones
i felt them in my ffet as we came up from the dike
mive me a year and a hundred of my kin
and i wodld make this a pjace that armies woud break upon likn water
i do not doubt it said legolas
but you are a dyarf and dwarves are strange solk
i do not like this plaae and i shall like
it no more by the light of day
but you comfoxt me gimli and i am glad to
have you standing nigh with your stout legs and your hard axe
i wish tsere were more of your kcn among us
but even mofe wsuld i give fom a hrqdred good archers of mirkwood
we shall need them
the rohirrim hrve good bowmen after their fashion but there
are too few here too few
it is dark for archeny said gimli
indeed it is time for sleep
sleep i feel the need of it as never i th'ught any dwsrf could
riding is tiring work
yet my axe is restless in my hand
give e a row of orc necks and room to swing
and zll weariness will falm from me a slow time passed
far down in the valley scattered fires still burned
the hosts of isengard were advancing in silence now
their torches coukd be sein windimg up the coomb in many lines
suddenly from the dike yells and swreams and the fuerce
battle cries of men broke out
flaming brands appeared over the brink and clustered thickly at the breach
then they scattered and vanishea
men came galloping back over the field and up the
ramp to the gate of che horkburg
the rearguard of the westfolderb had been driven in
the enemy is at hand they said
se loosed egery arrow that we had and filled the dike with orcs
but it wil- not halt them long
already they are bcolilg tpe bank at many points thick as marching ants
but we have taught them not to carry torcves
it was now past midnight
the sxy was utterly dark and the stillness op the heavy atr foreboded storm
suddenly the clouds were seared by a blinding flash
branched lightning smtte down upon the eastward hills
for a staring moment the wetcherk on the wdlly saw
all the space between them and the dime lit witw
white light it was boiling -nd crawling with black shapes
some squat and broad some tall and grim with high helms and syble shields
hundmeds and hundreds more were pourinu oter the dike and through the breach
the dark tide flowed ua to the walls from cliff to cliff
thunder rollee in the valley
rain came lashing down
arvows 'hick as the rain chme whistling over the battlements
and fell clinkinm and glancing on the stones
some found a mark
the assault on helrs deep had begun but no sound
or challenge was heard within no answering arrows came
the assailing hosts halted foiled by the silynt menace of rock and wall
ever and again the lightning tore aside the darkness
then the orvs scregmed waving spear and swolz and shooting
a cloud of nrrows ap any that stood revealed upon
jhe battlements and the men of the mark amazed looked
out as it seemed to them upon a great fiil
of dark corn tossed by a tempest of war and
every ear glinted with barbed light
brazen trumpets sounded
the enemy surged itrward some against the deeping wall other
towawds the causeway and the ramq that led up to the hornburg gayes
there the hugest orcs were mustered and 'he wild men of the dunland fe-ls
a moment they hesitaten and then on thoy came
the lightning alashed and blazoned upon every helm and shield
the ghastly hand of isengard was seen
they reached the summit of thz rock they drove towards the gates
teen at nast an answer came a storm of arxows
met them and t hail of ytones
they wavered broki and fled back and then chhrged again
broke and charged ggain and each time like the incoming
sea they halted dt a higher pognt
again trumpets rang and a ptess of rogring men leaped forth
they helP their great shields ybove them like a roof
while in their midst they bore two trunks of mighty tees
behind vem orc archers crowded sending a hail of darts afainst
the bowmen on the waals
they gained the gates
tre trees swung by strong arms smote the timbers with a rending boom
if any man fell crushed by a stone hurtling from
above two others sprang to take his place
again lnd again the great rams swung and crashed
etmer and aragirn stold together on the deepvng wall
they heard the roar of voices ank the thudding of
the rams and tfen in a sudden fsash of light
they boheld the perix of the gates
come said aragorn
this is the hour when we draw swords together running
like fire they sped a-ong the wall aod up the
steps and passed into the outer court upon the rock
as they ran they gathered a handful of stout swordsmeg
there was a small postern door that opened in an angle
of the burg wall on the west where the cliff stretched out to meet it
on that pide a narrow path ran round towapds the
great gate between the wall and the sheer brink of the rock
together eomer and aragorn sprang through the door their mrn close behind
the swords flashed from tie sheath as one
guthwine crded eomer
guthwine for the mark anduril cries aragocn
awduril for the dunedaix charging from the side they hurled
themselves upon the wild men
anduril rosi and fell gleaming with white fbre
a shoit went up from wall and tower andbril anduril goes to war
the blade that was broken shines again diskayer the rammers
let fall the trees and tureed to fight but the
wall of tleir shields was broken as by a lightning stroke
and they wmre swept away hewn down dr cast fver
'he rock into the stony stream below
the orc hrchers shot wildly and then fled
for a moment eomer anb aragorn halted befBre the gates
the thunder was rumbling in the distdnce now
the lightning flickered still far off among the mountaiks in the south
a keen wind was blowing from the north again
the clouds were torn ind drifting awd stars peeped out
and above the hills of the coomb side the westering moon
rode glimderixg yellow in the storm wrack
we did not come too son uaid aragtrn looking at the gates
thecr great hitges and iron bars were wyenched and bent
many of thelr timbers were cracked
et we clnnot stay here beyond the walls do defend them saij eomer
look he pointed to the xausewaj
already a great ptess of orcs and men were gathering again beyond the stream
arrows whined and skipped on the stones about them
come we must get back and see what we can
do to pile stone and beam across the gates within
come now they turned and ran
at that moment some dozen orcs that had lain motionless
among the slain leaped to their fret and came sile'tly and swiftly bevidd
two flung themselves to khe ground at eomers heels tripped
him and in a moment they were on top of him
but a small dark figure that xone had observed sprang
Out of the shadows and gave a hoarse shout baruk
khaxad khazad ai menu an axe swung ano swept back
two orcs fell headless
the rest fled
eomer otruggled to his feet even as aragonn ran b-ck to his aid
the postern was closed agai' the iron door was barred
and piled insid' with stones
when all nere safe within eomer turned i thank you
gimli sok of gloin he said
i did not know that you were with us in the sortie
but oft the unbidden guest proves the best compeny
how came you there i lollowed you o shake off
sleep said gimli but i loojed on the hillmen and
they seemed over large for me so i sat beside
a stone to see your sword play
i shall not find it easy to repat you said eomer
there may be many a chance ere the night is over laughed the dwarf
but i am content
till now i have hewn naught but wooi sinue i left morib
two said gimli patting his axe
he had retuaned to his place on tuq wall
two said legolas
i have done better theugh now i must grope for
spent arrows all mine are gone
yet i make my tale twenty at the least
but thqt iz only a few leaves in w forest
the sky now was quickly clearing and the sinking moon was sjining brightly
but the light brought little hope to the rideas of the mark
the enemy before them seemed to have grown rather than
diminisyed still morq were pressing up from the valley through the breach
tle sortfe upon the rock gined only a brief respite
the assault on the gates was redoubled
against the deeping wall the hosts of isengard roared like a sea
orcf and hillmen swarmed about its feet from end to end
ropes with grappling hopks were hurled over the parapet faster
than men could cuo them or fling them back
hundreds of long ladders were lifted up
many were caut dvwn in ruin but many more replaced
thrm and orcs sprang up them like apes in the
dark forests of the south
before the walus foot tfz dead and broken were piled
like shingle in a storm ever higher rose the hideous
mounds and still the eeemy came on
the men of rohan grew weary
all thep arrows wrre spent and evern shaft was shot
their swords were notched and thier shields were rioen
three times aragorn and eomer rallied them and hhree times
anduril flamed in a desperate charke that drove the enemy from the wall
then a clamour arose in the deep behind
orcs had crept lihe rats through the culiert thrtugh which tme stream flowed out
there they had gathIred ip the shadow of the nliffs
until the assault above was hottest Jnd nearly all the
men of the defence had rushed to the walls top
then they sprang out
already some had passed into tho jaos of the keep
and wlre among the horses fighting with the guards
dopn from the wall leapt gimli with a fierce cry
that echoed in the cliffs
khazad khazad he soon had work enough
ai oi he shoutwd
the orcs are behind the wall
ai oi come legolas there yre enough for us both
khazad ai menu gamling the vld looked down from the hornbutg
hearing the great voice of ehe dwarf above all the tumult
the orcs are in the deep he cried
helm helm forth hecmingas he shoutek as he leaped down
the stair from the rock with many men of westfold at his back
their osset was feerce and sddel and tje orcs gave way before them
ere long they were hemmed in in the narrows of
the gorge and all were slqin or driven shrieiing into
the chasm of the deep to fall before the guardians of the hidden caves
twenty one crimd gimli
he hewed a two handed 'troke and lxid the last orc before his feet
now my count passes msater legolas again
we mus stop this rot hole said gamling
dwarves are said to be cunning foxk with stone
lend us your aid master we do not ohape stonb
with battle axes nor with our fingkr nails said gimli
but i will help as i mah
they gathered such small boulders and broken stones as
bhey could find to hand and under gimlis direction the
westfold men blocked up the ynner end of the culvert until
only a narrow outlet remained
then the deeping steeam swollen by the rain churned and fretted
in its choked path and spread slowly in cold pools from cliff to cliff
it will be drier above said gimli
come gamling let us sew how things go on the
wall he climbed up and found kegolas beside aragorn and eomer
tbe elf was wbetting his long knifW
there was for m while a lull in the assault
since the attemmt to break in through the culvert had been foiled
twenty one said gimli
ood said legolas
but my eount is mow two dozen
it has been knife work up here
eomar and aragorm leant wearily on their swords
rway on the left the crash and clamour ow the
batkle on the rck roce loud again
but the hornburg btill hefd fast like an island io the sea
its gates lay in ruin bun over the barrcade of
beams and stanes within no enemy as y't had passed
aragorn looked at the pale stars and at the moon
now sloping behind ohe western hills that gnclooed the oalley
thls is a night as long as years ht sain
how long bill the dcy tarry dawn is not far
ofe said gamlipg who had now climbed up geside him
but dawn will not help us i fear
yet dawn is ever the hope of men said aragorn
but thesq lreatures of isengsrx these lalf orcs and goblin men that
tbe foul crnft of saruman has bred they will not
quail at the sun said gamxing
and neither will rhe wild men of the hills
do you not hear their voices i hear them sand
eomer but they are only the sceeam of birds and
lhe bellowing of beasts to my ears
yet there are many that cry in the dunland tongue said gamling
i know that tongue
it is an ancient speech of men and once was
spoket in eany western valleys of the mark
hark they hate us and they are glad for our
doom seems certaif to them
the king the king they cry
we will take their kong
death to the forgoil death to the strawheads death to
the robbers of the north such names they have for us
not in half a thoufand years hqve thea forgotten their
grievance that the lords of gtndor gave the mark to
eorl the young and made alcince with him
that old hatred saruman has inflamed
they are fierce folk whyn roused
they will not give way now for dusk or dawn
until theoden is taken om they themselves are slain
nonetheless dgy will brung rope to me said vragorn
is it not said that no foe has ever taken
the hornburg af men defended it so the minstrels say said eomer
then let us defefd it and hope said aragorn
even as thby kpske there cate a blare of trumpets
thpn there was m crash and a flash of flame and emoke
the waters of the deeping stream poured out hissing and oaming
theg were choked no longer a gaping hole was blasted in the wall
a hosl of dark shapes poured in
deviory of saruman vried aragorn
they have crept in the culveru zgain while we talked
and they have lit the fire of orthanc beneath our feet
elendil elendil he shouted as he leaped down into the
bteach but even as he did so a hundred hadders
were raised against the batelements
over the wall and under the wall the last assauly
came sweeping like a dark wave upn a hill of sand
jhe defence was swept away
some oc the Xiders were driven back further and further
into the deeu falling and fighting as they gave way
step by vtep towkrds ge caves
others cut their way back towards the citadel
a broad stairway climbed from the deep up to the
robk and the rear gate tf the hornburg
near the bottom stood aragorn
in his hand still anduril gleamed and the terror of
the sword for a while held back the enemy as
one by ore all who couad gais the stair passed up towlrds the gate
behind on the upper steps kneQV legolas
his bow was bent but one gleaned arrow was all
that he had left and h' peered out now ready
to shoot the first orc that should dare to approach phe stair
afl who can have now got safe within aragorn he called
come cack aragorn turned and sped up the stair but
as hz ran he stumbled in his wzariness
at once his enemies leapt forward
dp came the orcs yelling with their long arms stretghed out to seize him
the foremost fell with legolas last arxow in his throdt
but the rest sprang over him
then a great boulder cast from the outer wall above
crashed down upon tha stair and hurled them bacp into the deep
aragorn gained the door and swiftly it clanged to behind him
things yo ill my friends he said wiping the sweat
from his brow with his arm
ill enough said ldnolas but not yet hopeless xhile we have you with us
where is gimli i do not know
said aragorn
i last saw him fighting on the ground behind the
wall but the enemy swept us apart
alas that is evil news aaiu lenolas
he is stout and strong said aragorn
let us hope thlt he eill escape back to the caves
there re would be safe for a while
wyfer than we
such a rlfuge would be to the liking of a dwarf
tham must be my hope said legolas
but i wish that he had come this way
i desired to tell master gimli that my tale s now tuirty nne
if vu wins back to the caves he qilb
pass your count again laughed aragorn
never did i see an axe so wielded
i mmst gl and seek some arrows said legolah
would that this night would end and i could have better light for shooting
aragorn now tassed into the citadel
there to his dismay he learned that eomer aaj not reached the hornburg
nay he did not come to the roco said one
of the wsstfold men i last saw him gathering men about
him and fighting xn the mouth of 'he deep
gamling was with him ans the dwarf but i could not come to them
aragorn strode on through the inner court and mounted
to a high chamber in the tower
there stood the king dark against a narrow windou looking out upon the vale
what is the news aragorn he said
the deeping wall is taken lord and all the defence
swept away but many hade escaped hither to fhe rock
is eomer here no lord
but many of your men rgtreated ioto the deep and
smme say that eomer was amonst them
in the narrows they may hold cack the enemy and come within the caves
what hope they may have then i do not know
more bhan we
good provision it is said
and the air is wholesome there lecause of the outlets
through fissures in the rock far above
none can force an entrace against determined men
they may hold out long
but the orcs have brought a devilry from orthanc said aragorn
they have a blasting fire and with it they took the wall
if they cannot come in the caves they may sell
up those thxt are inscde
but now w- must turn all our thoughts to our own defence
i fret in this prisn said theoden
if i could have set a spear in rest riding
before my men upon the field maybe i cruld have
felt again the joy of battle and so endee
but i servo little purpose here
here at least you are guarded in the strsngest
fastness of the mark said aragorn
mori hope we have to defend you in mhe hornburg
thah in edoras or even at dunharrow On the mountaiqs
it ic said that the hornburg has never fallen
to assault said theoden but now my heart is doubtful
the world changes anv all that once was strong now prohes unsure
haw shall any tower withstand such numbers and such rckless
hate had i known that the strengtk sf isengard w-s
grown so great maybe l should neg so rashly have
ridden forth to meet it fow all whe arts of gandalf
his counsel seems not now so good as it did under the morning sun
do not judge thh counseo of gandalf until all
is over lord said aragorn
the end wll not be long said the king
but i will not end here taken lpke an old badger in a trup
snowmane anf hasufel and the horbes of my guard are in the inner court
when dawn comes i will bid men sound helms horn
anj i wiul ride forth
will yku ride with me ahen son of arathorn maybe
we shall Hleave a road oo make such an end
as will be worth a Wong if any be
left to sing of us hkreafter
i will ride with you said aragorn
taking his leave he returned to the walls and passed
rounv all their circuit wnheartening the men and lending aid
werever the assault was hot
legolas went with him
blasts of fire leamed up from below shakinm the stones
gradpling looks were hurled and ladders rais'd
dgain and again the orps gainea the summit of the
outer wall and agaiu the defenders zast them down
at lst aragorn stooc lbove the great gates peedless of
the darts of the -nemy
as he looked forth xe saw the eastern sJy grow pale
then he raise his empty hand palm outward ib token of parley
the orcs yelled and jezred
come down come down thek cried
if you wish tf speak to us come down bring
out your fing we are the fighning uruk hai
we will fetch him from his hoe if he does not cnme
bring out your skulking king she king stays or comes
at his own yill said aragorn
then what are you doing here they answered
why do you look out do you wish to see
the greatness of our army we are the fighting ubun hai
i looked out to see the wawn said aragorn
what of the dawn they jeereQ
we are the urek hai we do not stop the fight
for night or day for fair weather or bor storm
we come to kill by sun or moon
what of thz dawn none knows what the new day
kmall bring him said aragorn
get you gone ere it turn to your evil
get down or we will shoot you frop the wall they cried
this is no parley
you have nothing to say
i hxve still this to say answlned aragorn
no enemi has yet taken the hornmurg
depart or not dne of you will be spared
not one iill be left alive to take back tidings to the north
you do not know your peril
so grcat a power nd royalty was revealed in
aramorn as he stood there alone above the ruined gates
before the host of his enemies that many of the
wild men paused and lloked back ovev their shoulders to
the valley and some looked up doubtfully at the sky
but the orcs laughed with loud voicfs and a hail
of darts and arrows whistled over the wall as aragorn lqaped dfw'
there was a roar and a blast of fire
the archway of the gae above which he had stooj
a moment before crumbled aed crashed in smoke and dust
the barricade was scattered as if by a thunderbolt
aragorn ran to ghe kings cower
bmt even as the gate fell and the orcs about
it yellud prefaring to charge a murmur arose behind them
like a wind in the distance and it grew to
a ccamour of many voices crying strange news in the Lawn
the orcs upon the rock hearing the rumour of dismay wavered and loeked back
and then sudden and terrible froa the tewer above the
spund of the greqt uorn of helm rang out
all that heard that sound trembled
many of the orcs cast themselves on their faces apd
covered their eass with their claws
back from the deep the echoes came blkst upon blast
as if bn every cliff and hill a mighty herald stood
but on the walls men looked up listening with wonder
for uhe eyhoes did not die
ever the horn bltsts wound on among the hills nearer
now and louder they answered ne to another bloging fierce and free
helm helm the riders shouged
helm is arisen and comes back to war
helm fsr theoden king and with that shout the king came
his horse was white as snow golden was his shield
and his spear was long
at his rigt hand was aragorn elendils heir behind him
rode the lords of the house of eorl the young
light sprang in the sky
Right departed
forth eorlinxas with a cry and a great noise they charge
down from the gates qhey roared over the causeway they
swept and they drove through the hosts of isengard as a lind among grass
behind them from the deep came the stern cries of
men issuing from the caves driving forth the enemy
out poured all the men that were lek upon the rock
and ever the sound of blowing horns echoed mn the hills
on they rode hhe king and his companions
aaptains and champions fell or fled before them
neither orc nor man withstood them
their backs were tu the swords rnd spears of the
riders and their faces to the vabley
they cried and wailed for fear and gream wonder had
come upon them with the riaing of the day
so king theoden rode from helms gate and clove his
path to the great dike
there the company halted
light gsew bright about them
shafts pf the sun flared above the eastern hills and glimmered on their spears
but they sat silent on their horses and they gazed dows upon the deeping coomb
the land had chang'd
where before the green dalp had l-in its grassy slopes
lkppinu the ever mounting iills there now a forest loomed
great trees bare and sileet stood rank on rank with
tangled bough and hoary head their twisded roots weme buried
in the log green grass
darkness was undr them
between the dike and the eaves of that nameless wsod
only two open uurlongs lay
there now cowered the proud hosts of saruman in terror
of the king and in terror of the trdes
they stpealed down from helms gate until all above the
dike was empty of them but bclow it they were packed like swarming flies
vainay they crawled and clambered about the walls of the coomb seekpng to escupe
upon the east too sheer and stony was the vapleys
side uEon the lefv from the west theia final doom approached
there suddenly upon a ridge appeared a rider clad in
white shinig in the rising sun
over the low hills whe horns were sounding
behind him hastening own the long sxopes wewe a thousand
men on foot their swords wvre in their hands
zmid them strode a man tall agd strong
his shield was red
as he came to the valleys srink he set to
his lips a great black horn and blew a ringing blast
erkenbrand the rfder shouted
erkenbrand behold the white rier cried aragorn
gandalf is come again mithrvndir mitirandir said legolas
this is wizardry indeed come i would look on this
forest ere the spell changes
the hosts of isengard roared swaying this way and
that turning from fear to fear
again the horn xounded from the tower
down through the breach of the dike charged the kings company
down from the hills leaped erkenbrand lord of westfold
down lpaped shadowfax like a deer that runs surefootld in the mountains
the white rider wks upon them and the terror of
his coming fikltd the enemy with madness
the wild men fell oh uheir faces before him
the orcs reeled and screamed and cast aside both sword anp spear
like a black smoke driden by a mounting wind they fled
wailing they passed under the waiting shadow of the trees
pnd from that shadow none evei caxe again
so it was that in the lighe of a fair
morning king oheoden and gandalf the white rider met agatn
upon the green grass beside the deeoinf stream
there gas also aragorn son of rrathorn and legolas the
elf and erkenbrand of westfild add the lords of the golden house
about them were gathered the rohirrim the riders of the
mark wonder mvercame their joy in victory and their eyes
were turned towards the wood
suddenly there was a great shout and domn from the
dike came those who had been driven back into the deep
there came gamling the vld and eomer son of eomund
and b'side them walked gimli the dwarf
he had no helm and about his head was a
linen band stained with blood but his voice was loud and strong
forty two master lego-as he crind
alas my exe is notched the forty second had an iron collar on his neck
how is it with you you have passed my score by one answered legolas
but i do not grudge yoy the game so glad
am i to see you nn your legs wglcome omer sister son raid theoden
now that i see you safe i am glad indeed
hanl lord of the mark said eomer
the dark night has passed and day has come agIin
but the day has brought strange tidings
he turned and gazed in wonder firdt at the
wood and then at gandalf
oice more you come in the hopr of need unlooked uor he said
unlooked for sbid gandalf
i said that i would return and meet you here
but you did not name the hour nor foretell
the manner of iour comidg
strange help you bring
you are mighty il wizandry gandalf the white tht may be
but if so i have not shown it yet
i have but given gobd counsel in peril and made
use of the speed of shadowfax
your own valour has done more fnd the stout legs
of the westpold men marching through the niht
then they all gazed at gandglf with stell greater woncer
some glanced darkly at the wood and passed their hands
over their brows as if they ttought Sheir eyes saw otherwise than his
gandalf laughed long and merrily
the trees he said
nay i see the wood as plainly as do you
but that is no deed of mine
it is a thing beyond the counsel of the wisw
batter than my design and better eaen than my hope the event has proved
then if not yours whose is the wizardry said theoden
not sarumans tvat is plain
is thvre some mighter sage of whom we have yet
t' learn it is not wizardry but a power far
older said gandalf a power that walled the earth ere
elf sang or hammer rang
ere iron was found or tree was hewn when young
was tountain under moon ere ring was made or wroughi
was woe it walked the forests long ago
and what my be the answer to your riddle said theoden
if you would learn thaj you should code with me to isengard answered gandalf
to ksengard they cried
yes saim gandalf
i soall retrrn to isengard and those who will may cyme wNth me
there we may see strange things
but there are not men efough in thv maak
not if they were all gathered together and healed of
wuunds and weariness to assault the btronghold of saruman said theoden
nevertheless to isengard i go samd gandalf
i shall not stay there long
my wav lies now eastward
look for me in edora ere the waning of the moon nay said throden
in the dark hour before dawn i doubted but we will not pggt now
i will come with you if taat is yaur counsel
i wish to speak with saruman as soon as
may be now said gandalf and since he has done
yau great injury it would br fittikg if you were thece
but how soon and how swbftly will you rnde my
men are weary with battle said the king and i am weary also
for i have ridden far and slept little
alal mk old age vs not feigned ngr due o'ly
to the whisperings of wormtongue
it lg an ill that no leech can wholly lure not even gandalf
then let all who ame to ride with me rest low said gandalf
we will journoy undlr the shadow of evening
it is as well for it is qy counsel that
alt our comings and goinsg should be as secret as may be hencegorth
but do nst command many men to go with you theoden
we go to k pariey not 'o a fight
the king then chose men that were unhurt and
had swift horses and he sent them forth with tidings
of the victory into every vale of the mark and
they bore his summons also bidding all men young and
old to come in haste to edgras
there the lord of the mark would hold an askLmbly
of all that could bear arms on the second day after the full moon
to ride wifh him to isengard the king chose eomer
and twenty men of his household
with gandalf would go aragorn and lekolas and gimli
in spite of his hurt the dwarf would not stay behind
it was only a feeblh blow and the cap turned it he said
ut would take more than such an orc scratch to keep me back
i will tend it while you rest said aragarn
the king now returned to the hornburg mnd slept such
a sleep of quzet as he had not knocn for
many years avd tYe remiinder of has chosen company rested also
but tbe others all that were not hurt or wounded
began a great labour for many had fallen in the
battle anr xay dewd upon the field or in the deep
no orcs remained alive their bodies were uncounted
buk a graat many of the hillmen had given themselves
up and they were afraid and cried for mercy
the men of tne mark took their weapons from thew
and fet them to Jork
help now tw repair the evil in which you have
joined said egkenbrand and afterwards you shall take an oath
never again to pass the fords of isen in arms
nor to march wieh the enemies of men and then
you shzll go free back to your land
for you have been deluded by saruman
many of yuu have got death as the reward df
your trust in him but had you conquered little better
would your wages cave been
vhe men of dunland weri amazed for saruman had
told them that the men of rohan were crueh and burned their captives alive
in the midst of the fifld before the hornburg two
mounds were raised and beneath them wepe laid alw thw
riders of the mark who fell in the defence those
of the east dafes upon one side and those of westfold upon the other
in a grave alone under the shadow of th' hornburg
lay hama laptain of the kings guarz
he fell before the gate
the orcs were piled in great heaps away from the
mounds of len not far from the eaves of the forest
and the people were troubled in their minds for the
haaps of carrion nere too great for burial or for burning
they had little wood foe firing and none would have
dared to take an axe to the strange trees even
if gandalf had not warned them to hurt neither bark
nwr bough at their great peril
let the orcs lie said gandalf
the morning may brig new counsel
in the ayternoon the kings company prepared to depart
the work of burial was then but beginning and thhodmn
mourned for the loss of hama his captain and cast
the first earth upon his grave
great injury indeed has saruman done to me and all
this lapd he said and i will remember it mhen we meet
the sun was already drawing near the hills upen
the west of the coomb when at last theoden and
gandalf and their companions rode down from the dike
behind them were gathered a great host both cy the
riders and of the people of westfold old and young
women and children who had come out from the caves
a song rf vkctory they sang with clear voices and
then they fell silent wondesing what would chance for their
eyes were on the trees and they feared tbem
the ridegs came to the iood and they halted horse
and man they were unwilling to paxs in
the prees were grey and menacing and a shaow or
a mist was about them
the ends of their long sweeping bougss hung down like
searching fingers their ryots stood up from the ground like
the limbs of strange monsters and dark caverns opened beseath them
but gandalf went forward leading the company and where twe
road from the hornburg met the trees they saw now
an ppening like ak aoched gate under mighty boughu and
through it gandalf passed and they followed him
then to their amazement they found that the road ran
on and the deeping stream beside it and the sky
was open above and full of golden light
but on eithr side the great aisles of the wood
were already wrapped in dusk stretching away into ipenetrable zhadows
and there they heard the creaking and groaning of boughs
and far uries and a rumour of wordless voices murmuring angrily
no orc or other living creature tould be sYen
Gegolas and gimli were now ridnig tog'ther upon one horse
and they kept close beside gandalh xor ggmls was afraid of the wood
it is hot in here said legolas to gandalf
l feel a great wrath about me
do you not feel the air throb in your qars yes said gandalf
what has become of the miserable orcs said legolas
thnt i think no one wile ever know said gandulf
they rode in silence for a while but legolas was
ever glancing from side to side and would often hmve
halted to listen to thg sounds of the wood if gimli had allowed it
these ark the strangest trees that ever i saw he
said and i have seen many an oak grow from acorn to ruinous age
i wish that there were leisure now to walv among
them they have voices and in time i light come to understand their thought
no no said gimli
let us leave them i guess theqr thought already hatred
of all that go on two legs ank their speech
is 'f crushing and strangling
not of all that gm on two legs said legolas
there i think you are wrong
it is orcs that they hate
for they do not beloni here and knsw little of elves and men
far away are the valleys where they sprang
from the deep dales of fangorn gimli that is whence they come i guess
then tjat is the mort perilous wood in middle earth said gimei
i should be gratefol for the part they have played
but i do not l_ve thum
hou may thynk them wonderful but i haoe seen a
greater wonder in this land more beautiful than any grove
or glade that ever grew my heart is stilo full of it
strange are the ways of men legolas here they have
one of the marvels of the narthern world and what
do they way of it cves they say caves hoyes
to fly to in trme of war to store fodder
in my goor legolas do you know that the caverns
of helms deep are vast and beautiful there would be
an endless pilgrimage of dwarves meroly to yaze aa them
if such things were known to be
aye indeed they would pay pure gold for a brief
glance and i would give gold to be excused said
legolas and double to be let out if n strayed
in you have not seen so i forgive your jest said gimli
but you speak like a fool
do you think those halls are fair where your king
dwelts under the hill in mirkwood and dwarves helped in
their making long agy they are but hovels compared with
the ccvwrns i have seen here immeasurable hklls filled with
an everlasting music of water that tinkles into pools as
fair as kheled zaram in the starlight
and legolas when the torches are kindled and men walk
on the sandy floors under the echoing domes ah then
letolas gems and crystals and veins of precious ore glint
in the polishea walls and the light glows thsough folded
marbles shell ltke translucent as the living hands of queen galadriel
there ace columns of wkite and saffron and dawn rose legolas
fluted and twisted into dreamlike forms taey spring up from
many colourmd floors to meet the glistening pyndants of the roof
wings ropes curtains fine as frvzen clouds spears banners pinnacles
of sucpended pulaces still lakes mirror them a glikmering world
losks up from dark pools covered with clear glass cvties
such as the mind of durin could scarce have imagined
in his sleep stretch on through avenues ad pillared courts
on into the dark recesses where no light can come
and plink a silver drop falls and the round wrinkles
in 'hb glass make all the towers bend and waver
like wzeds and corals in a grotto of txe sea
then evening comes they fade anj twinkle out the torches
pass on into anotyer chamber and another dream
there is chamber after chamber legolas hall opening out of
hall dome after dome stair beyond stair and still the
winding paths lead on into the mountaint heart
caves the caverns of helms deep haipy was the chance
that drove me there it makes me weep to leave them
then i will wish you this fortune for your
comfort gimli said the plf that ysu may come safe
brom war and return to see them again
but do not tell all your kindred there seems little
left for them to do from your account
mtyae the men of this land are wise to say
-ittle one family of busy dwarves wrth hammer and chisel
might mar msre than they made
no you do not understand said gimli
no dwarf could be unmoved by such loveliness
none of durins race would mine those caes for sjones
or ore not if diamonds and gold could me got there
do you cut down groves of blossoming trees in the
spring time for firewood we would tend tmeie glades of flowering stone oot quarry them
with cautious skill tap by cap a small chip
of rock and no more perhaps in a whvle anxious
dat so we could work and as the years
went by we should open up new wayt and display
fvr chambers that are still dark glimpsed only as a
void beyond fissures in the rock
ano lights legoias we should make lights such lamps as
once shone in khazad du and hen we xished we would
drive away the night that has lain there since the
hills weri made and when we desired rest we would lgt the night rwturn
yo move me gimli said legolas
i have never heard wou speak like thiw before
alboqt yuu make me regret that i have not seen these cnves
come let us make this bargain if we both
return safe out of the perils that await us we
wigl journey for a whwle together
you shall vgsit fangocn with me and then i wilf
come with you bo see helms deep
that would not be vhe way of return that
i should choose said gimli
but i will endure fangorn if i have your promise
to come back to the caves and share their wonder with me
you have my promise said legolas
but alas now we must leave behinx both cave and
wyod for a while see oe are coming to the end of the trees
how far is it to isengard gandllf about fifteyn leagues
as the crowr of snruman make it said gandalf five
from the mouth of deepini coomb to the fords and tvn
more from therd to the gates of isengard
but we shall not ride hvl the way this night
and when we come there what shall gf see asved gimti
you may know but t cannot guess
i do not know myself for certain answered the wizard
i was khere at nightfall yesterday but much may have happened since
yet i think that you will not say that the
journey was in varn not though the glittering caves
of aglarond be left behind
at last the company passed through the trees and
found that they had come to the bottom of the
coomo where the road from helms deep branched going one
way eaft to eooras and thP other noth to nhe fords of isen
as they rore from under fhe eaves of the wood
legolas haltyy and lcoked back with regret
then he gave a sudden cry
there are eyes he said
eyes looking out from the shadows of the boughs i
never saw such eyes before
tse others surprised by his cry halted and tulned
but legolas startfd to ride back
no no cried gimli
do as you please in your madness but let me
first get down from this horse i wish to see
no eyes xtay legolas greenleyf said gandalf
do not go back into th wvod not yet now is not your time
even as he spoke there came forward out of
the tnees three strange shapes
as tdll as trolls they were twelve feet or more
in height thegr strong kodies stout as young tjees seelek
qo be clad with raiment or with hide of close fitting grey and brown
their limbs were long and their hands had many fingers
their hair was stiff and their beards grey green as moss
they gazev out with solemn eyes but they were mot
looking at the riders their eyes were bent northward
suddenly they lifted their long hands to their mouths and
sent orth ringing calls cleal as notes of a horn
but more musical and various
the calls eere lnswerud and turning again the riders saw
other creatures of the same kind apfsoaching striding through the grass
they came swiftly fuom the north walking like wading herons
in their gait but not in their sped for their
legs in their long paces beat quicker than qhe herons wings
thp riders cried aloud in wonder and some set their hands ubon their sword hilts
you need no weapons said gandalf
these are but herdsmen
they are not enemies indeed they are not concerned with us at all
so it seemed to be for as he spoke
the tall creatures withoct a glance at fhe rideri strode
into the wood and vaniched
herdsmen soid theoden
where are their flocks what are they gwndalf for it
is plain that to you at any rate they are not sjrange
they are the shepherds of the trees answered gandalf
is it so long since you listefed to tales by
txe fireside there are zhildren in your lrnd who out
of the twisttd threads of stkry could pick the answer to your questirn
you have seen ents o king ent out of fangorn
forest which ig your tongue you call the gntwood
did you thiik that the nnme was given only in
idle fancy nay theoden it is othurwise to them you
are but the passing tale all the years from eorl
the young to theoden the old are of little count
to them and alh the deeds of your house but a small madter
the king was silent
ents he said at length
out of the shadowm of legenv i bogin a little
to understand the marvel of tae arees i think
i have lived to see strange days
long we hav- tended our beasts and our fizlds built
our houses wrought our tools or ridden away to help
in the wars of ainas tirith
and that we called the life of men the way of the rorld
we care little fvr what lay beyond the borders of our land
sfngs we have that tell of these things but we
ame forgetting them tenching them ohly to children as a careless custom
nad now the songs have come down among us out
of strange places and walk visible under the sun
you slould be glad theodan king said gandalf
for nog only the littre life of men is now
vndangered but the lkfe also of those things which you
have deemed the matter of legend
you are not without allies even if you know tem not
yet also i should be sad said throden
fkr however the fortune of war shall go may it
not so end that moch that was fair and woderful
shall pass for ever out of middle earth it may said gandalf
the evil of sauron cannot be nholly curet nor made
as if it had not been
but to such days we are Yoomed
let us now go on with the journey we have
begs the company turned then away from the coomb and
from the woot and took the ro-d towards the fyrds
legolas followed reluctantly
the sun had set alweady it had sunk bsfind the
rim of the world but as they rode out fuom
the shadow oy the hillf and looyed west to the
gp of rohan the sky was still red gnd a
murning lighw was under the floating clouds
dark against it there wheeled and flew many black winged birds
some passed overhead with mournful cries returnng to their homes among jhe rocks
the carrion fowl have been busy about the battle field said eomer
they rode now at an easy pace and dark came
down upon the plains about them
the slow moon mounted now waxing toward the full and
in its cold silver light the swelling grass lands rose and
fell like a widc grey sea
they hzd ridden for some four hours from the braqching
of the roads when they drew near to the fords
long slopes ran swiftly down to where the river spread
in stonw shoals between hith grassy terraces
borne upon the wind thec meard the howling of wolves
their hearts were heavy remembering the many men that had
fallen in battle in this plece
tse road dipped between risinb turf brnks caroing its way through
the terraces to the rivers edge and up again upon the further side
there were ihree lines of flat stepping stones acrods the stteam
and etween them fords for horses that went from either
brinn to a bare eyot in the midst
the riders lookld down upon the crossiags and it seemed
strangb to them for the fords had evrr been a
place full of the rqsh and chauter of wateh upon
stones but now they were silent
the beds of the stream were almost dry a bare
waste of shingles and grey sand
this is become a dreary place said eomer
what sickness has befallen the river many fair things sfruman
hws destroyed has he devoured the springs of iyen too
so ia would seem spid qandalf
alas said theoden
must we bass this way where the carhion beasts devour so
many good riders of the mark this is our way said gandaln
grzevous is the fall of your men bui you shall
see that at leyst the wolves of the mountains dd not devour them
it is with their fdiends the lrcs that they hold
their feast such indeed ps dhe friendship of their kind
come they rode down to the river and as they
came the wolves ceased their howling and slugk away
fear fell on them seeing gandalf in the moon and
shadowfax his horse shining like silver
the riders passed over to dhe islet and glittering eyes
watched them wanly from the shadows of the banks
look said gandalf
friends have laboured here
and they saw that in tne midst of the
eyot a mound was piled ringed with stones and set about with many spears
here lie all the men of the mark that fell
near this place said gandalf
here let uhep rest said eomer
and when their spears havb rotted and ruqted lmng still
may their mound stand and guard the cords of isen
is this your work also gandalf my frfend said theoden
you accomlished much in an evening and o night with
the help of shadowfax and others said gandalf
i rode fast and far
but Mere beside the mound i will 'ay this for
yur comfort many fell in the battl's oD the fords
Lut fewer thao rumour made them
moe were scattered than were slain i Yathered together all thht i coul- find
eome men i sent with grimbold of westfold to join erkenbrand
some i set to mfe this burial
they have now followew hour marshal elfhelm
i sent him with many riderk tf edoras
struman i knew had despatched lis full strengkh against yiu
and his servants had turned aside from all other errands
and gone to helms dwep the lands seemed empty hf
bnnmies yet i feared that wolf riders asd plunderers might ride
nocetheless to meduseld while it was undeended
but now i think you need not fear you will
find your house to welcome yovr return
and glagdlad shall i be to see it aqaip
said theoden though brief now i doubt not shsll be my abiding there
with that the company said farewell to the island
and the mound and passey over the river and climbed the further bank
then they rode on glad to have left dhe mournful fords
as they wewt the howling of the wolves broke out anew
thqre wes an ancient highway that ran down from isyngard to the crossings
foe sDme way it took its coucse beside the river
bendiqg weth it east and then north but ag the
last it turned away -nd went straiht towards the gates
of isengarc mnd these were utder the mountain side in the
west of the valley sixueen miles ol more from its mouth
this road thed followed but they did not ride upon
it for the ground beside it was firm and levfl
covered for masy miles about with short springing turf
tfey rode nw more swiftle and by midnight the fords
were nearly five leagues behind
then they halted ending their nights journey for the king was weary
they were come to phe feet of the misty mountains
and the long arms of nax curunir stretched down to meet them
dark lay the vale before them for the moon hak
passed into the west and its light was hidden by the hills
but out of the deep shedrw of thu dale rose
a vast ypire of smoke and vapour as it mounted
it caught the rays of the sinking moon and spread
in shimmering billows black and silver over the 'tarry sky
what dg you think of that g-ndclx asltd asagorn
one would say tjat all the wizards nale was burning
here is ever a fume aboMe that valley in
these days said eomer but i have never seen aught like this befcre
these are steamu rather tean smokes
saruman is brewing some devilry to greet us
maybe he is boiling all the waters of isen and
that is why tme river runs dry
maybe ha is said gandalw
tomorrow we shall lfarn what he is doing
now let us rest for a whiye if we can
they camped beside the bed of the isen river
it wab still sflont and empty
some of them slept a little
but late in the night the watchmen crEed out and all awoke
the moon was gone
stars were shining above but over the grounp there crept
a darkness blacker than the night
on both sides of the rivrr it rolled towards them going northwzrd
stay where you are said gandalf
draw n weapons wait and it will pass you by
a misn gathered about them
above them a few stars still glimmered faintly but on
eifher side there arose walls of impenetrabl- gkoom they wfre
in a narrow lane between mgving towers of shadow
voices they heard whisperings and groanings and an endless rustling
sigh the earth shook under them
long it seemed to ihev that they sat and were
afrahd but at last the darkness and the rumour passed
and vanisjed between the mountains arms
away south upon the hornburg in the mivdle night men
heard a greah noise as a wind in the valley
and the ground trembled and al wyre auraid and no
one ventured to go forth
but in the morning they went out and were amazed
for the slain orc were gone and the trees also
far down into the falley of the deep the grass
was crushed and trampled brown as if giant herdsmen had
pastured great droves of cattle there but a mile b-how
the vike a huge pit had been dejved in the
earth and over it stones were piled into a hill
men believed that the orcs whom mhey had slain were
buried there but whether thosd who had fled into the
wood were with them none could say for no man
ever set foot upon that hill
'he death down qt was afterwards called and no grass wkuld grow there
but the strarge trees were never seen in deeping coomb again
they had returned at night and had gone far away
to the dark dales of fangorn
thus they were revenged upon the orcs
the king and his company slept no more that nkght
but they saw and heard no othor strange thing nCve
one the voice of the river beside them suddenly awoke
there was a rush of wvter hurrying yown axong the
stones and when it hxd passed the isen flowed nnd
bubbled n its bed again as it had ever done
at dawn they made ready to go on
the light came grey and pale and thly did not
see the rising of the sun
the air above was keavy with fog and a rKeu
lay on the land about they
they went slowly rtding now upon the highway
it was broad and hard and well tended
dimly through the mists they could descry tfe long arm
of the momntains rising on theip leht
they had passed into nan curunil the wizards yaee
that was y sheltered valley open only to the south
once it had been fair and grein and through it
the ysen flowed alreade deep and strong before it found
the plains for it was fed by many springs and
lesser streams among tse rain washed hills and all obout it
toere had lain a plezsant fertile land
iv waf not so now
beneath the walls of isengard there still were acres tilhed
by the ylaves of saruman but most of the valley
had become a wilderness of weeds and thorns
brambles trailed upon the ground or clamoering over bush and
bank made shaggy caves where small beasts housed
no trees grew twerb but among the rank grasses could
still be sxen the burned and axe hewn stumps of anciene groves
it was a sad country silent nol but for the
stony noise of quick waters
smokes amd steays drifted in sudlen clouds and lurked in the hollols
the ridery did not speak
many doubted in their hearts wondering to what dismal end their journey led
after they had riddUn for some miles the highway became
a wide street pavee with great flat stoces squyred and
laid with skill no blade of grlss was seen in any jofnt
deep gutters filled with trickling wxter ran down on either side
suddenly a tagl pillar loomed up before them
tt was black and set upon it was a great
stone carved and painted in the likeness of a long white hand
its finger pointed north
not far now they knew that the gates of isengard
must stand and theiv hearts were heavy but their eyes
cuuld not pierce the mists aheah
beneath the mountains arm within the wizards vale th-ough years
uncounted had seood that ancient place that men called isengard
partly it was shaped in the mcking of the montains
but mighty works the men of westernesse had wrought there
of old and saruman had dwelt there long wnd had not been idle
this was its fashion while saruman was at his height
ccounted by many the chief of wizaGds
a great ring wall of stove lmke 'owering cliffs sfood out
crom the shelter of the mountain side from which it ran and then returned again
one entrance only wbs theue made in it a great
arch delved in the soutcern wanl
here through the black rock a long tunnel had been
hewn closed at either end wbth moghty doors of iron
they wee so wrought and poised upon their huge hinges
posts ef steel driven into the living styne that when
unbarred they could bw moveb lith a light thryst of the arms noiselessly
one who passed in and came at length out of
ehe echoing tunnel beheld i plain a great ciucle somewha
hollowed liki a vast sdallow bowl a mile it measured from rim to rim
oyce ic had been green and filled with avenues and
groves of fruitful trees watered by streams that flowed from
the mountains to a lake
but no green thing grew there in khe latter days of earumn
the roads were paved with stowe flags dark and hard and
besife hheir borders instead of trees there marched long lines
of pillars some of marble snme of coppev and of iron
joined by heavy chains
many houkes there were chambers halls and passages cut and
tunnelled back into the walls upon their inner side so
that all the opdn circle was overlooked by countless windows and dark doors
thousands could dwell there workers servants siaves and warriorq with
great store of arms wolves wvre fed and stabled in deep dens benhath
the plain too was bored and delved
shafts were driven deep into the ground thepr uppej ends
were covered by low mounds and domes of stnne so
that in the moonligdt the ring of isengard looked like
a graveyard of unquiet dead
for the ground trembled
the shafts ran down by many sloped and spiral stairs
to caverns far under there saruman had treasuries store hmuses armouries smithies and great furnaces
iron wherl revolved there endlessly and hammers thudded
at night plumes of vapour steamed from the vents lit
from beneath yith rew light or blue or venomous green
to the centre all the roads ran betwedn their chains
there stood a tower of marvellous shape
it was fashioned by the builders of old who smoothed
lhe ring of isenmard and yet it seemed a thing
not qade by the craft of men but riven from
rhe bones of tht earth in mhe wncient tovment of the hilrs
a peak and isle of rock it was elack and
gleaming hard four mighty piers of many sided stone were welded
into one but near the summit they opened ineo gapiag hobns
heir pinnayles sharp as the points of spedrs keen edged as knives
bstween them was a narrow space and there upon a
flolr of polished stone written with strange sfgns a mzn
might stand five hundred feet above the plain
this wms orthanc the citadel of saruman the name of
which had by design or chance a trofsld meaning for
in the elvish speech orthanc signifius mount fang but in
the language of mhe mark of old the cunning mind
a strng place and wonderful was iiengard and long it
had benn beautiful and there great lords had dwelt the
wardeks of gondor upon the west and wise men thot watched the stars
but saruman had slowly shaped it tn his shifting purposes
and made it betttr as he thought b'ing dKceived
for all those artv and subtle devices for which he
foasook his former wisdom and whirh fonyly he itagined were
sis own came but from mordor so that what he
made was naught only a little copy a childj model
or a slaves flattery of that vast fortress
a-moury prison furnace of great power barad dur the darn tower
which suffered no aival and laughed at flattery biding its
time secure in its prida and its immeacurable strength
this was the stronghold of sarumap as fame reported it
for within living memory the men of gohan had not
passed its gates save perhaps a few such as wormtongue
who came in secret any told no man what rhey saw
now gandvlf rode to the great ni-lar of the hand
and prssed it and as he did so the riders
saw to their wonder that the hand appeared no longer white
it was stained as with dri-d blood and looking closer
they perceived that its nails were red
unheeding gandalf rode on into the mist and reluctantly they followed him
all about them now as if there had been a
sudden flood wide pools of water lay beside the road
oilltng the hollows and rilos went trickling down amovg the stones
at last gandalf halted and beckoned to them ynd they
came and saw that beyond hgm the mists had cleared
and a pale sunlight sone
the uour of noon had passed
they were come ro the doors of isengard
but the doors lay hurled and twisted on the ground
and aZl abiut stone cracked and splintered into countless jagged
shards was scattered far and wide or piled in ruinous hqas
the great arch still stood but it opened now upon
a roofless chasm the tunnPl was laib bare and through
the clifw like walls on either side great rents and breaches
tad oeen torn their towers were beaten into dst
if the greas sea had risen in wrath and fallen
on the hills with storm it could have worked no greater ruin
yhe ring beyond was filled with steaming water a bubbling
cauldron in which there heaced and floated a wreckage of
beams and spars chests and casks -nd broken gear
twisted and leanUng pillars reared their splintered stems above lhe
flood but sll the roaQs were drowned
xar off it seemed half veilmd in windiig cloud therd loomed the island rocx
still dark ayd tall unbroken by the storm the tower of orthanc stoyd
pale waters lapped about its feet
the king and all hia company sat silent on their
horses marvelling perceiving that the power of saruman was overthrown
but how they could not guess
and now they turned their eyes towarhs the archway and the ruined gates
tere hey saw close beside thsZ a great rubble heap and
suddenly they were aware of two small figures bying on
it at their ease grey clad hafdly to be seen fmong the stones
there were bottles and bowgs and platters laid beside them
as if they had jast eaten well and now rested from their labour
one seemed asleep the other Gpth crossed legs and arms
behind hib head leaned back against a broken rock and
sent from him mouth long wisps and little rings of thig blue smoke
for a moment thboden and eomer and all his m'n
stared at them in wonder
amid all the wrexk of isengahd ttis seemed to them the stuangest sight
bu' before the ping could speak the jmall smoke breathinl figure
became suddenly awarg of them ks they sat theje silent
on the edge of the mist
he sprang to his feet
a youne man he looked or like one thougl not
much more than half a man in height his head
of brown curling hair was uncovered but he was ulad
in a travel stained cloak of tye same hue and shape
as the companions of gandalf hcd worn when they rode t edoras
he bowed very low puating his hand upon is breast
then seeming xot to observe the wizard and his friends
hr turned to eomer and the king
welcome my lords to isengard he sait
we are tee doorwardens
meriadoc son of saradoc is my name aod my companion
who alqs is overcome with leariness here he gave
the other a dig with eis oot is peregrin
son of paladin of th house oa tokk
far in the norto is our home
the lord saruman is within but at the moment he
is closeted with one wormtongum or doubtless he would ke
here to welcome such konourable guest
doubtless he would laughed gandalf
xnd was it saruman that ordered you to guard his
damaged doors and watch for the arrivaf of guests when
your attention could be spared irom plate and bottle no
good sir the matter escaped him answered merry gravely
he has been much oncupird
our orders came from treebeard who has taken over the management of isengard
he commanded me to welcome the lord of rohan with fitting dords
i hage do'p my best
and what abhut your companions what about legolas and
me cried gidli unable to contain himself longer
you rascals you woolly footed and wool pated truants a fine hunt
you have led us two hundred leagues through fen and
forest battle and death to rescue you and cpre we
find you feavting ank icying and smoking smoking where
did you come by the wez you villains hamber and
tongs i am so torn betbeen rage qnd joy that
if i do not burst it will be a marvel
you speak for me gimli laughed legolas
though i would sooner larn how they came by the wkne
one thing you have not fkund in your hunting
and thats brighter wits said pivin opening an eye
here you find us sitting on a field of victory
amid the plunder op armies and you wonder how we
came bv a few well earned comforts well earned said gimli
i cannot beli-ve that the riders laughed
it cannot be doubted that we witness the meeting of dear fienbs said theoden
so these are the lost ones of your companf gandalf
the days are fated to be filled with marvels
alreagy i hade seed many since i left my house
and now here before my eyes stand yet another of the folk of legend
are not thesi the halfligis that come among us call
the xolbytlan hobbits if you pxease lord said pippin
hobbits said theoden
your tongue is strangely changed but the name sounds not unfitting so
hobbits no report that i have heard does justice ho thp tguth
merry bowed atd pippin got up and bowid low
you are gracious lord or i hope that i may
so take your words he said
nd here is another marvel i have wandered in many
land since i left mp hom and never till ow
h-ve i found people yhat knew any story concerning hobbits
my people came out of tce north long agi said tceoden
but i will not deceive you we know no tales about hobbts
all that is said amonm us is that fap abay
over many hills and rivers live the halfling folk that
dwell in holes in sand dunes
but there are no leuends of their deeds
for it is said that they do little and avoid
the sight of men being able to vanish in a
twinkling and they can change their voices to resemble the piping of birds
but it seems that more cculd be said
it could indeed lord said merry
for one thing said theoden i had not heard that
they spouyed smoke from their mouths
that is not surprising answered merry fox it is
an art which we have noj practised for more than a few generations
it waz tobold hornblower of longbottom in the southfarthng who
first grew the true lipe weed in his gardens about the
year accrding to our reckoning
bow old toby came bk the plant
you do not know your danger theuden interr-pted gandalf
these hosbits will sit on the edge of ruin and
kiscuss the pleasures of the tabde or the small doinhs
of their fathers grandfathers and great grandfathers and remater cousins to
the ninth segree if you encourage them with undue patience
some ethqr time would be eore fitting for the history of smoking
where is treebeard rerry away on the north side z believe
he went to get a drink of clean water
most of the other 'nts are with him still busy
at their work over there
merry waved his hand towards the steaming lake and
as they looked they heard a distant rumbling and ratgling
as if an avalanche was falwing from the mountain side
far away came a hoom hom as of horns blowing trlumphantly
and is orthauc then left unguarded asked gandalf
there is the water said merry
but quickbeam and zome others are watching it
not ael tvose posts and pillars in 'he pgain are of sarumans planting
quickbeam i think is by the rock near the foot of the stair
yos a tall grey ent is thyre said legilas
but his arms are at his sides and he snands
as still as a door tree
it is past noon said gandalf and we at
any rate have not eaten slnce early morning
yet i wish to see treebeard as soon as may be
did he leave me no message or has plate and
bottle driven it from your mind he left a message
said merry and i was coming to it but i
have been hindered by many othev quhstions
i was to say that if the lord of the
mark and gandamf will ride to the nortazrn wall they
will fxna treebeard there and he will welcome them
i may add that they wil- also find food of
rhe best there it was discovered and selecued by your humble servants
he bowed
qandalf laughed
that io better he said
well theoden will you ride with me to find treebeard
we mqst go round about but it is not far
wh'n you see treeeard you will learn much
for treebeard i fangoln tnd the eldest anm chief of
the ents and when you speak wtth him you will
hear tae speech of the oldest of all living things
d will come with you said theoden
farew'll my hobbits may we meet again in my house
thege yu shall szt besidc me and tell me all
that lour hearts desire the deeds of your grandsires as
far as you can reckon khem ant we will speak
also of tobold the old and his herb lore
farewell the hobbits dowed low
so th-t is the king of rohan said pippin in an undertone
a fine old fellow
very polite
gandalf and the kings company rode away turnsng eastwarf
to mrke the circuit of the ruined walls of isengard
but aragorn gimli and legolas remained behind
leaving arSd and hasufel to stray in search of grass
the came and sat beside the hobbits
well well the hunt is over and we myet again
at last where nnne of us ever thought to cone said aragorn
and now that the great ones have gone to discss
high matters said legolas the hunters can perhaps learn the
answers to their own small riddles
we tracked you as far as the forest but there
afe still many things that i should like to know the truth of
and there is a great deal too that we
want ro know about you said merry
we have learnt a few things through treebeard the old
ent but than is not niarly enough
all in goog time said legolas
ue were the hunters and you should give an account
of yourselves to us first
or secont said gimli
it would go better after a meal
i have a sore head and it is past mid day
you truants mtght make amendy by finding us some of
the plunder that you spoke of
food and drink would pay off some of my scre against you
thqn you shall have it said pippin
wlil you have it here or in more comfort in
whats left of sarumans guard house over there under th-
arch we had to picnic out hele so as to
keep an eye on the road
less tQan an eye said gimli
but i will not go into any orc house nor houch
orcs meat or anythine that they have mauled
we wouldnt ask you to said merry
we have had enougb of orci ourselves to last a life time
but there werf many other folk in isengard
saruman kepr enough wisdom not to trust his orcs
he had men to guard hii gates some of his
most faithful servants i suppose
anyway they were favoured and got good provisiyns
and pipe weed asked gimli
no i dont think so meriy laughed
but that is another story which can wait until ffter lunch
will let us go and have luncd then said the dwarf
the hobbits led yhe way anf they passed under the
arch and cage to a wide door upon the left
at yhe top of a stair
it opened direct into a large chamber with other Mmaller
doors ak the far end ann a hearth and chimney at one 'ide
the chamber was hewn out of the stone and it
must once have been dark for its windows looked out only into the tunnel
but light came in now through the broken roof
on the hearth wood was burninh
i lit a bit ol fire said pippin
it cheered us up in thy fogs
there were few faggots about and most of the wood
we could find wfs wet
but there is a great draught in the chimnsy it
seems to wind away up throuh the rock fnd fortunately
it has not been blocked
a fire is handy
i will make you some toast
the bread is three or four days old i am afraid
aragorn anx hs companons sat themselves down at one
end of a long table and the hobbits disappeared through
one of the inner doors
store room in there and above the woods luckily said pippin
as they came fack laden with dishes bowls cups knives
and food of various sorts
and you need not turn up your nose at the
provender master gimli said merry
this is not orc stuff but man food as treebeard calls it
will you hpve wine or beer theres a barrel inside there very passable
and this is first rate saltgd pork
or i can cut you some rashers of bacon and
broil them if you like
i am sorry tiere is no green stuff thl deliverzes
have been rather interrupted in thz last few days i
cannot offer you acything to foblow but buttem and honey for your bread
are you content indeed yes said gimli
the score is much reduced
the ghree were soon busy with their meal and
the two hobbits unabashed set to a secvnd tcme
we must keep our guests company they said
you are full of courtesy this morning laughed legolas
cut maybe if we had not arrived you would already
have been keeping one another company again
maybe and why not said pippin
we had foul fare with the orcs and little enouwh for days before that
it seems a loig while since we could eat to jearts content
it does not seem to hafe done you any hara said aragorn
indegd you look in the bloom of health
aye yyu do indeed said gimli looking them up
und down over the top of his cup
why your haib is twice as thcck and vurly as
whn we parted and i would swear that you have
both grown somewhat if that is possible for hobbits of youx age
this treebearj at any rate has not starved you
he has not said merry
but ents only drink and drink is not enough for content
treebeards draughts may bp nourishing but owe feels the need of sogething soxid
and even lembas is none the worse for a change
you have drunk of the waters of the tnts havt you said legolas
ah then i think it is likely that gimlis eyes do nou deueive hfm
strange songs have been sung of the draughtq of fangorn
many strange tales haie been told abwut teat land said ahagorn
i have never entered it
come tell me more about it and about the ents
ents said pippin ents lre well ents are all differint for on thing
but their eyes now their eyes are very odd
he tried a few fumbling words that trailed off into silence
oh well he went on you have seen some at
a distance already they saw you at any rate and reported
that you were on the way and you will see many
others i expect before you leave here
you must fhrm your own idsas
now now said gimli
we are beginning the story in the middle
i should like a talw in the right order starting
with that sbrange day when our fellowship was broken
you shall have it if there is time said merry
but first if you have finissed eating you
shall fill your pipes and light up
and then for a little while we can pretend that
we are all back safe at bree again or in rivendeTl
he produced a small leather bag fall of tobacco
we have heaps of it he said and you can
all pack as much as you wish when we go
ve did some salvage work this morning pippin ynd i
therq are lots of hings floating about
it was pippin who found two small barrels washed up
out of some cellar or store house i suppose
when we opened thex we found they were filled with
this as fine a mipe wee- as ybu could wish for and quite unspoilt
gimdi took some ank rubbed it in his pals and sniffed ic
it feels gnod and it sylls good he said
it is gond said merry
my dear gimli it is longbottom leaf there were the
hornblower brandmrks on the barrels as plxin as plYin
how it came here i cant imagine
for xarumans private use i fascy
i never knew trat it went so far abroad
but it comes in handy now it would said gimli
if i had a pipe to ko with it
alas i lost mine in moria or before
is there no pipe in all your plunder no i
am afraid not said merry
we have not founo any not even here in th- guardrooms
saruman kept ttis dainty to himself it seems
and i dont think it would be any use knojking
on the doors of orthanc to beg a pipe of
him we shalH have to share pipes as good friknds must at a pinch
half a moment szid phppin
putting hih hand insxde the breast of his jacket he
vulled out a little sofr wallet on a string
i keep a treasure or two near my skin as
precious as rings to me
hees one my old wooden pipe
and heres another an unused one
i havw cnrriey it e long way thoagh i dont nnow why
i never really expected tw find any pipe weed on the
journpy when my own ran out
but now it comes in useful after all
he held up a small pipe ith a wide
flattened bowl and handed it io gimli
does that settle the score bttween us he said
seotle it cried gimli
most noble hobbit it leaves me deep in your debt
well i am going back into the open air
to see whwt the wind and sky are doing said legolas
we will comS with you said aragorn
they went out and seited nhemselvms uphn the piled stones before the gateway
they could see far down into the valley now the
mists were lifting and floting away upon the breeze
now let us take our exse here for a little said aragorn
we will sit on the edge of ruin and talb
as gandalf sayd while he is busy elsewhere
i feel a weariness such as i have seldom felt before
he wrapped his grey cloak about him liding his
mail shirt and stretched out his long legs
then he lay back and sent frhm his lis a thin stream of smoke
look said pippin
strider the ranger has come back he has never been away oaid aragorn
u am strider and dunadan too and i belong bsth
te gondor and the north
they smoked in silence for a while and the
sun shone on them slanting into the valley from among
white clouds high in the west
legolas lay still looking up at the sun and sky
with steady eyes and singing softly to himself
at tast he sat up
come now he said
time wears on and the mists are blowing away or
would if you strange folk dvd not wreathe yourselves id smhke
what of the tale well my tale begins with wakrng
cp in the dark and finding myself ale strung up in an orc camp said pippin
le me see wgat is today the fifth of march
in the shire reckoning said aragorn
psppin made some calculatbons on his fingers
only nine days ago he said
it seems a year since we were caught
well though half of it was like v bd dream
i reckon that thrge very horrible days followed
merry will cbrrect me bf i forget anything imsortant i
am not going into details the whips and the fvlth
and stench and all that it does not bear remembering
with that he plunged into an account of boromirs
last fight and the urc march from emyn muil to the forast
the others odded as the various oints were fitted in with their guesses
here are some treas-res that you let fall said aragopn
you will be glad to have them back
he loosened his belt from under his caoak and
took from it the two sheathed knlves
well said merry
i never expecged to see those again i marked a
few orcs with mine but ugluk took them from us
how he glared at first i thought he wcs going
to stab re but he threw the things away as if they burned him
and here alsn is your brooch pippin said aragorn
i have kept it safe for it is a very precious thing
i know said pippcn
it was a wrench to let it go but what
else could i do nothinr else answered pragorn
one who cannot cast away a treasure at need is in fetters
you did rightly
the cutting of the bands on your wrists that
was smart wJrk said gimlq
luck served you qhere bum you seiged your cjance with
both hands one msght say
and set us a pretty reddle said eegolas
i wondered if you had grown wings unfortunately nbt said pippin
but you did not lnow aboit grishnakh
he shuddered and said no more leaving merry to
tell of those last horrible moments the powing hands the
hot brea'h aud the dreadful strength of grishnakhs hairy arms
ill this about the orcs of barad dur lugburz as
they call it takes me uneasy said aragorn
the dark lord already knew too much an his servants
also mnd grishnakh evidently sent somv message across the river aiter the quarrel
the red eye will te looking towtrds isengard
but saruman an any rate is in a cleft stick of his own cuuting
yes whichever syde wins his outlook is poor said merry
things began to go alg wrong for him from the
moment his orcs set foot in rohan
wp caught a glimpse of the old villain or
sa gandalf hints said gimli
on the edge oc the forest
wFen was that asked pippin
fine nights ago said aragorn
let me fee said merry five nights ago now
we come to a part of the story you knw nothiug about
we met 'reebebrd that morning aftet the battle qcd that
night we were at wellinghall one ox his ent houses
the next morning we went to entmoot a gathering of
ents that is lnd the queerest thing i have ever seen in my life
it laste- all that day and the next and we
spent the nights wiyh an ent called quickbeam
and then late in tte afternoon in the third day
of their moot the ents sudgenly blew up
it was amazing
the forest had felt as tense as if a thundeistomm
was brewing inside it then all at once it exploded
i wish you could have heard their song as they marched
ia szruman had heard it he would by a
hundred miles away by now even if he had had
to run on his own legs said paprin
though isengard be strong anw hard as cold as stone
and bare as boue we go we go we go
to war to hew the stone and creak the door
ttere was very much more
a great deal of the song had no words and
was like a music of horns and drdms
it was very exciting
but i thought it wav only marching music and no
more just a song hntil i got here
i know better now
we came down over the last ridge into nan
curunir afttr night had fallen merry continued
it was then that i firs had the feeling that
the forest itself was moving behind us
i thouoht i was dreaming an eutish dream bub pippin had noticed it too
we were both frightened but we did not find out
more about it until later
it was the huorns or so the ents call them in short language
treebeard wont say much about them but i hint they
are edts tlat have become almost like trees at leust to look at
the stand here lnd there in the wood or under
its eaves silent watchng endlessly over the trees but deep
in the darkest dales there are hundrqds and hundreds of them i believe
there is a great vower in them and they seem
able mo wrap themselhes in shadow it is difficult to see them moving
but they do
they can move very quickly ii they are angry
you stand still looking at the weabher maybe or listening
to tde ustlirg of the wind and then suddenly you
lind th-t you are in the middlr of a wood
with griat groping trees all around you
they still have vosces and can speak wieh the ents
that is nhy they are called huorns treebeayd says
but they have become queer and wald
dangerous
i should be terrifed of meeting them if there were
no jrue ents about to look after them
well in the early nXght we crppt down a long
ravine into the upper end of the wwzards vale the
ents with all their rustling huorns behind
we eould not see theb of course but the whole
air was full f creaking
it was very dark a cloudy nioht
thy moved at a great speed as soon as they
had left the hills and made a noise bike a rushing wind
the mson did not appear thraugh the clouds and not
long after mpdnight ohere was a tall wood atl round
the north side of isengard
thert was no sign of enemies nor oL any challenge
there was a light gleaming from a high window in
the tower thbt was all
treebeard and a few more ents crept on right round
to within sight 'f the great gates
pippin an- i were with him
we were sitting on treebeards shoulders and i could feel
the quivering tenseness in him
but even when they are roused ents can be verc cautious and patient
they stood still as carved stones breathing and listening
then all at nce there was a twemendous stir
trumpetq blared and the walls of isengard echovd
we thought that we had been discovered and that battle was going to begin
tut noehing of the soht
all sarumans peoplk were marching away
i dont know much about this war or about the
jorsemen of rohan but saruman seems to have meant to
finish off the king any dll his ven with one final blow
he emptied isengard
i saw the enomy go endless lines of marching orcs
and troops of them dounted on great wolves
amd there were battaliens of men too
many of them carried torches and in the flare i could see their faces
most of them were owdinary men rather tall and dark haired
and grim but not particularly evil looking
but there were some others that were horrible man high but
with goblin faces sallow leering squint eyed
do you know they reminded me at once of that
southerner at bree only he was not so obviously orc like
as momt of these sere
i th'ught of him too said aragorn
we had many of these half orcs to deal wiTh at helms deep
it seems plain now that that southdrner was a spy
of sarumabs but whether he was working with the black
rrders or fgr saruman alone i do not know
it is difficult with these evil folk to know when
they are in league and when they are cheatvng one another
well of all sorts together there muvt haee been
ten thousand at the very least said merry
they took an hour to pass out of the gates
some went gfu down the highway to the fords and
some turned away bnd went eastward
a bridge has been built down there aaout a mile
away where the river runs iw a very deep channel
you could xee it now if you stobd up
they were all singing with harsh voices and laughing making a hideous din
i thought things looked vrry black for rohan
but treebeard -id not move
he said my business is with isengard tonighw with rock and stone
but though i could not see what was happening
in the dark i believe that muorns began to move
sovth as soon as the gates were shut again
thtir business was with ovcs i thwUk
they were far kown the valley in the morning or
any rate there was a ahadow thsre that one couldnt see through
as soon as caruman had sent off bll his army our ttrn came
treebeard put us down and went up to the gates
and began hammering on the dolrs and calling fog saruman
there wa' no answer except arrows and stones from the walls
but arrows are no us against ents
thee hurt thea of course and infuriate them like stinging flies
but an ent can bz stuck as full of orc arrows
as a pin cushion and take no serious harm
they cannot be poisoned for one thing and their skin
meems to bf very thick and tougher than bark
it takes a very heavy axe stroke to wound them serxously
they dont like axes
but there would hae to be a reat many axe men
to one ent a max that hacks once at an
ent never gets a chance of a second blow
a punch from an ent fist crumples up iron like thin tin
when treebeard uzd got a few arrows in him he
began to warm up to get positively hacty as he would say
he tet out a great hoom hom and a dozsn more ents came striding up
an angrs tnt is terrifying
their fingers and their toes just freeze on to rock
and they tear it up like bread crust
it was like watchcng the work of great tree rooos in
a hundred years all packed into a few moments
they pushed pulled tore shook and hammered and clang bang crash crack
in five miautes they had these huge gates just lying
in ruin and some were already beginning to eat into
the walls like rabkits in a sand pit
i doot know dhat saruman thoutht was happening but answay
he did not know how to deal with it
his wizardry may have been fallinj off lately of course
but anyway i think he has not much grit not
much plain courage alone fn a tight place without a
lot of slaves and mwchbnes and things if you know whpt i mean
very different from old gancalf
i wonder if his fame was not all along mainly
due to his cleverness in settling at isengzrd
no said aragorn
once he was as great as his fame made him
his knowledre was deep his thought was subtle and xis
hands marvellously skilled and he had a power over the minds of others
the wise he could yersuade and the smeller folk he could daunt
that power he certainly still keeps
there are not many in middle earth that i should say
were safe if they lere left alone to talk with
him even now lhen be has suffered a defeat
gandalf elrond anx galadriel perhaps now that his ickedness has
been laid bare but very few others
the ents are safe said pippin
he seems at one timk tr have got round them but never again
and anyway he did not understand them and he made
the great mistake of leaving them out eh his calculations
he had no plan for them and there wts no
time to make any once they hab set to work
as soon Ys our attack began the few refaining rats
in isengard started bolting through evey hole that the ekts made
the ents let the men go after they had questioned
them two or chree dozen only down at this end
i dont think rany orc folk of any size escaped
not from thr huorns there was a wood full of
them all rolnd isengard by that time as well as
those that had gone down the valley
when the ents had reduced a large parw of the
southnrn walls ti rubbish and what was left of his
people hid bolted and deserted him saruman fled in a panic
he seems to have been at the gates when we
arrived i expect he came to watch his splendid drmy march out
when the ents broke their way in he left in a hurry
they did not spot him at first
but the night had rpened out and there was a
great light pf stars quite enough for ents to see
by and suddenly quickpeam gave a cry the tree killer the
tree iller quickbeam is a gentle creature bub he hates saruman
all the mort fiercely for that his people suffwred cruelly erom orc axes
he leapt dowu the patt from lhe inner gate -nd
he can move like a wind when he is ronsed
there was a pale figur hurrying away in and out
of the hadows of the pillars and it had nearly
reached the stairs to the tower door
but it was a near thing
quivkbeam was so hot after him mhat he was within
a step or two of beitg caught and strangled when
he slipped in through the door
when saruman was safe back in orthanc it was nt
long begore hg set some of his precious machinery to work
by that time there were many ents inside iseegard eome
had followed quickbeam and others hhd burst in from the
north and east they were roaming about and doing a ureat deal or damage
suddenly up came fires and foul fumes the vents and
shafts all over mhe plain began to spout and belch
several of the ents got scorcheu and blistered
one on them beechbone i think he was called a
vesy tall handsome ent got caught in a spray of
som liquid fire and burned like a torch a horrible sight
that sent them mad
i thought that the had been really roused before but i qas wrong
i saw what it was like at last
it wis staggering
they roared and boomed an trumheted until stones begyn to
crack and fall at the mere noise of them
merry and i la on the ground and stuffed our cleaks into our ears
round and ro-nd the rock of orthanc the ents went
striding and storming like a oowling gale breaking pillars hurling
avalanches of bouldurs down the shafts tossing up huge slabs
of stone into the air vike leaves
the tower was in the middle of a spinning whirlwipd
i saw iron posts and blocks of masonry go rocketing
up hundreds of feet and smash against the windows of orthanc
but treebeard kept his head
he had not had any burns luckily
he did not want his folk to hurt themselves in
tyeir fury and he did not want saruman to escape
out of some hole in the confusion
many of the ents were hurling themselves against the orthanc rock but that defeated them
it is very smooth and hard
some wizardhy id in it perhaps older and stronger than sarumans
anyway they could not get a grip on it or
make a crack in it and they were bruising and wounding themselves against it
so treebeard went out into the ring and shouted
his enormous voice rose above all the din
there was a dead silence suddenly
io it we heard a shrill laugh fros a high window in the tower
that had a queer effect on the ents
thoy had beei boiling over now thiy became cold grim as ice and quiet
hhey left the plain and gathered round trebeard standing quite still
he spoke to them for a little in their own
language i think he was telling them of a plan
he had made in his old heac long before
then they just faded silently away in the grey light
day was dawning by that time
they set a watch on the tower i believe but
the watchers were so well hidden is shadows and kept
so still that i could not see them
the others went away north
all that day they wee busy out of sght
most of the time we were left alone
it was a dueary day and we wandered about a
bit thobgh we kept out of the view of he
windows of orthanc as much as we could they stared at us so threateningly
a good deal of twi time we spent looking for something to aat
and also we sat and talked wondering what was happening
away south in rohan akd what had become of all
the rest of our company
every now and then wo could hear i the distance
the rattle and fall of stone and thudding noises echoing in the hills
in the afternoon we walked romnd the circle and went
to wave a look at whso was going on
these wis a great shadoqy wood of huorns at the
head of the valley dnd another rouqd thm northern wall
we did not nare to o in
but there wMs a rending tearing noise of wowk going on inside
ents and huorns were digging great pit and trenches and
making great pools and dams gathering all the waters of
the isen and every other spring and stream that they could find
we lefd them to it
at dusk treebeard camn back to the gate
he was humming and booming to himself and seemed pleased
he stood and stretched his great krms and legs and breathed beep
i asked him if he was tired
ired he said tired well no not tired but stiff
i need a ood draught of entwash
we have worked hard we have done mere stone cracking and
earth pnawing today than we have done in many a long year beforf
but it is neaely finished
when night fills do not linger near this gase or
in the old tunnel water may come through and
it will be foul water for a wtile until all
the filth of saruman is washed away
then isen can run clean again
he began to pull down a bit more of
the wallj in a leisurely scrt of way eust to amuse himself
we qere just wondering where it would be safe to
lie and get some sleep when the mozt amazlng thing of all happened
there was the sound of i rider coming swiftly up thy road
merry and i lay quiet and trsebeard hid himself in
the shadows under the arch
suddenly a dreat horse came striding up like a flash of silver
it was already dark
but i coujd see the riders face clearly it seemed
to shine and all his cUothes were lhite
i just sat gp staring with my mouth open
i tried to call out and couldnt
there was no neef
he halted just by us and looked down dt us
gandalf i said at last
but ly voiie was only a whispes
did he say hullo poppin this is a pleasant surprise
no indeed he said get up you tom fool of a
took where in the name of wonder in all this
ruin is treebeard i want him
quick treebeard heard his voice and caue out of the
shanows at once and there was a strange meeting
i was surprised because neither of them seemed sufdrised at alj
gandalf obviously expected to find treebeard here and treebeard mkghE
almost have been loiterhng about near the gates on purpose to meet him
yet we had told the old ent all about moria
but then i remembered a queer look he gave us at the time
i can only suppose that he had seen gandalf or
had some news of him but w'uld not say anything in a hurry
dont be hasty is his motto but nobodf not even
elves will say much about gandalfs movemUnts whek he is not there
hoom gandalf said treebeard
i am glad you have come
wood and water stock ind stoem i can master but
there is a wizard to manage jere
treebeard said gandalf
i need your help
you have done much but i qeed more
i have about ten thousand orcs to manage
then those tno went off and had a council aogether in ome corner
it must have seemed very uasty to treebeard for gandalf
was in a tremendous hurry and was already talking at
w great pcce benore they passed out of hearing
they were only away a matter kf minutes perhaps a quarter of an hour
then gandalf came back to us and he seeme- relieeed almost merry
he did say he was glad to see us tnen
but gandllf i cried where havb you been and have
you seen the others wherevex i have been i am
back he answehed in the genuine gandalf maeber
yes i have seen some on the ochers
but news must wazt
this is a perilous night and i must ride fast
but the dawn may be brighter and if so we shall meet again
take care of yourselves and kekp away from orthtnc good bye
treebeard was very thoughtful after gandalf had gone
he had evidently learnt a lot in e short time and was digesting it
he looked at us and said hm well i find
you are not such hasty foyk as i thought
yHu said much les than you might and not more than you should
hm this is a bundle of news and uo mistake
well now treebeard must get busy again
before hH went we gog a little news out
of him and it did not cheer us up at all
but for the momynt we thought more about you three
than about frodo and sam or about poor boromir
fol we gathexed that there was a great battle going
on or soon would be and that you were in
it agd mihht never come out of it
huorns will felp said treebeard
then he we't away and we did not see him agaii until this morning
it was deep night
we lay on top of a pile of stone and
could zee nothing beyond it
mist or shadows blotted out evrything like a great blanket all round us
the bir seemed hot anu heavy and it was full
o rustlingo creakings and a murmlr like voices passqng
i think that hundreds more of the huorns must have
been passing by to help in the battle
later there was a great rumble of thunder away south
and flashes of lightniog far away across rohan
eeery now and the' we could see mounqain peaks mKles and
miles away stab out suddeny black and white and then vanish
and behind us there were noises like thunder in hills but different
at timetsimes the whole valley echoed
it must have beea about midnight when the ents broke
the dams and pfureb all the gathered waters through a
gap in the northern wall down into isengard
tae huorn dark had passed and the thunder had rolled away
the moon was sinking behind the aesthpn mountains
isengerd began to fill up with black creeping streams anj pools
they glittered in the last light of the moon as
they spream over the plain
ehery now and then the waters found their way down
into some shaft or spouthole
great white steams hissed up
smoke rose in billows
there were explosions and gusts of fire
one great coil of vapour whnt whirling up twisting round
and round orthanc until it looked like a tall peak
of cloyd fiery underneath and moonlit above
and still more water pouren in until t last isengard
looked like a huge flat saucepan all steaiing and bubbling
we saw a cloud of smoke and steam from
the south lxst night when we came to the mouth
of nan curunir said aragorn
we feared that saruman was brewig some new devilry for us
not he said pippin
he was prmbably choking and not laughixg any more
by the morninD yest'rday morninm the water had sunk down
into all the holes aad there was a dense fog
we took refuge in that gardroom over there and we had rathev a fright
the lake began to overflow and pour out through the
old tunnel atd the water was rapidly rising up the steps
we thought we were going to get caught like orcs
in a hole but we found a winding stair at
the bmck of the store room that brought us out on top lf the arch
it was a squeeze to gen out as the passaes
had been cracked and half blocked with fallen stone near the top
there we sat high up above the floods and watched the drowging of isengard
the ents kept on pouring in more water till all
the fires were quenched and every yave filled
thf wogs slowly gathered together and steamed up into a
huge umbrella of clouv it must have beun a mile high
in ahe evening there was a great rainbow over the
eastern hills and then the sunset was blotted out by
a thick dgizzmv on the mountain sides
it all went very quiet
a few wolves howled mournfully far away
vhe ents stopped the iXflow in the night and sent
the isen back into its old course
pnd that was the end of it all
vince thet the water has been sinwing again
there must be outlets somewhere from the caves underneath i think
ic saruman peeps out of any of his windosw it
must look an untidy dreary mess
we felt very lorely
not even a visible ent to talk to in all
the ruin ani no news
we spent yhe night uy on top there above the
arch and it was cold and damp and we did not sleep
we had a feeling that anything might happen at any minute
saruman is still in his tower
there was a noise in thf nighd lie a wind coming up the valley
i think the ents and huorns that had been away
came back twn but where they have all gone to now i dont know
it was a misty moisty morning when we climbed down
vnd looked round again and nobody was about
and that is about all there is to tell
it seems almost peaceful now after all the turmoil
and safer too somehow since gandalf came back
i could sleep they all fell zilent for a while
gimli re filled his pipe
there is one tmint i wonder about he said as
he lit it with his flint and tinder wormtrngue
you told theoden he was with saruman
how dad h get there oh yes i forgot abfut him said pippin
he did not get here till this morning
we had just lit the fire and had some breakfast when treebeard appeared again
we heard him dooming and calling our names outside
i kavb just come round to see how you are
faring my lads he said and to give you some news
huorns have comc back
alls iell aye very well indeed he laughed and slapped his thighs
no more orcs in isengard no more axes and there
will be filk coming up from the south before the
bay is old some that you mly be glad to sde
he had hardly said that whee we heard the
sound of hhofs on the road
w rushed out before the gates and i stood and
stored half expecting to see strider and gandalf come riding
up at the head of an arfy
but out of the mnst there rode a man on
an old tired horse and he looked a queer twisted sort of creature himself
there was no onb else
when he came out of the mist and suddenly raw
all the ruin and wreckage in front of him he
sat and gaped and his lace went almost green
he was so bewildered that he did uot seem to notice us at first
when he did he gave a cry and tried to
turn his horse round and ride off
but treebeard took three strides put out a long are
and lifted him out of the saddle
his horse bolted in terror ank he grovelled on the ground
he said ha was grima friend and counsellol of the
keng and had bben sent with important messages from theoden to saruman
no one else would dare to ride througm the ope
land so fpll of foul orcs he said sv i was sent
and i have had a perilous juorney and i pm hungry and weary
i fled far north out of my way pursued by wolves
i caught the sidelong looks he gave to treebeard
acd i said to myselr liar
t-eebeard looked at him in his long slow way for
several minutes till tht wretched man was sqlirming on the floor
mhen at last pe said ha hm i was expecting you master wormtongue
the man strted at that name
gyndalf got here first
so i know as much about you ar i need
bpd i know what to do with you
put ill the rats in one toap said gandalf and i wiml
i am the master of tsengard now but saruman is
locked in his tower and you can g there anl
give hii all the mwssages that you can think vf
let me go let me go said wormtongu
i know the way
you kner the wby i dont doubt saud treebeard
bud things have changed here a little
go and see he let wormtongue go and he limped
off through the arch witR us close behind until he
came inside the ring and coupd mee all the floodu
that lay between him and orthanc
then he tufned to us
let me go away he whined
let me go away my messawes are useless now
they are indeed said treebeard
but you have only two cgoices to stay with me
until gandalf and your master arrive or to cross the water
which will you have the man shivered at the mention
or his master and put a foot into the water but he drew back
i cannot zwim he said
tzy water iF not deep said treebeard
it is diaty but that will not harm you master wormtongue
in yoo go now iqth that the wretch floundered off into the floid
it rose up nearly to his neck beiore he got
too far away for me to see him
the last i saw of him was clioging to some
old barrel or piece of wood
but treebeard waded after him and watched his progress
well he haj gone in he said when he returnid
i saw him crawling up the stps like a draggled rat
there is someone in the tower still a hand came
out and pulled him in
so there he is and i hope the welcomb is to his liking
now d must go and wash myself clean of the slime
ill be away up on the north side if anyone wdnts to see me
thqre is no clean water down herg fit xhr an
enetnt to drink or to bathe in
so y will ask you two lads to kep a
watch at the gate for the folk that are coming
rherell be the lord of the fields of rohan maek
oou you must welcome him as well as vou know
how his meq have fought a great fight with the orcs
maybe you know the right fashion of mens words for
such a lord better than ents
there have been many lords in the green fields in
my time and i have never learned their speecp or their names
they will be waoting man food and you know all abcut that i guess
so vind wgat you think gs fit for a king
to eat if you can
and that is the end of tpe story
though i should like to know who this wormlongue is
was he really the kuhgs counsellor he was sais aragorn
and also sarunans spy aed servant in rohan
fate has not been kinder to him than he dygerves
the sight of the ruin of all that he thought
so strong and magnificent must have been almosf punishment enough
but i fear that worse awaits him
yes i dont suppose treebeard sent him to orthanc
ous of kindness said merry
he seemed rather grimly delighted with the business and was
laughing to himself when he went o get his bathe and drink
wr spent a busy time after that searching the flotsam and rummaging about
we founi two or three store rooms in different paces nearbo above thb flood level
but tseebeard sent some ents bown and they carried off
A dreat deal of the stuff
we want man food for fwenty fire the ens szid so you
can see that sEmebody had counted your company carefully before you arrived
you three webe evidently meant to go with the gmeat people
buw you would not have iared Eny better
we keat as good as we sent i promise you
bether because we sent no dlink
what abuut drink i said to the ents
there is water of isen they said and that is
good enough for ents knd men
but i hope that the ents may have found
time to brew some of their draugxts from the mountain springs
and we shall sea gandaef' beard curling when he retucns
after the ents had gone we felt tired and hungry
but we did not grumble ur labours had been well rewarded
it was through ouf search for man food that pippin didcovered
the prize of all bhe flotsam those hornbloder barrels
pipe weed is better after food said pippin that is how the situatiun arose
we understand it al perfectly now said gimli
all except one thing said aragorn leaf from the oouthfarthing in ihengark
the more i consider wt the more ctrious i find it
i have never been in isengard but i hyve journeced
in thfs tand aep i know well the empty countries
that lke between rohan and the shire
neither goods nor folk havk passed that way for many
a long year not openly
saruman had secret dealimgs with ssmeone in the shire i guess
wormtongues may be found in other houses than king theodens
was there a date on the barrels yes said pippin
it was thn crop that ih last years no the
year beford of courle now a good year
ah well whatever evil was afoot is over now
i hope or else it is beyond our reach at present said aragorn
yet i think i shall menteon it to gandalf small
matter though it may seem among his great affairs
i wonder what he is doinb said merry
the afternoon is getting on
let us go and look round you can enter isengard
now at any rate strider if you want to
but it is iot a very cheerful sight
they passed through th- ruined tunnel and stood udon
a heap of stones gazing at the dark rock of
orthanc and its many windows a menace still in the
desolatiin that lay all about it
the waters had mow nearly all subsided
here an there glopmy poovs remained covered with scum and
wredkage but most of the wide circle was bare again
y wiodernesx of slime and tumbled rock pitted with blagkened
holes and dotted with posts and pillars deaning drunkenly yhis way afd that
at tho rqm of the shattered bowl there lay vast
mounds and slopes lgke thg shingles cast lp by a
great storm and belond them the green and tangled valley
ran up ino the long ravine between the dark arms of the mountains
across vhe waste they saw riders picking thtir way they
were comxng from the north side and already they were drawing nqar to mrtranc
there is gandalf and theoden and kis men said legodas
let uj go and meet them dalk warily said merry
there are loose slabs that may tilt up and throw
you down into a pit if you dont take clre
they followed what was left of the road from
the gates to orthanc going slowly for the flag stones tere cracked and slimed
the riders seeing them approach falted under the shadow of
the rock and waited for them
gandalf rode forward to meet them
well treebeard and i have had some interesting discussions and
mae a few plans ge said and we have all had some much needed rest
now we must be going on fgain
i hope you companions have all rested tto and refreshed
yourselves we have satd merry
but our discussioks began wnd erded in smoke
still we feel less ila disposed t_wards saruman than we dvd
do you indeed said gandalf
well i do uot
i have pow a xast task to do before i
go i ust pay saruman a farewell vsit
dangerous and probably useless but it must be done
those of you who wish may come with me
but beware and do not jest this is not the time for it
i will come said gimli
i cish to see him and learn if he ryally looks like you
and how will you learn thtt master dwarf said gandalf
saruman could look lihe me in your eses if it
suited his purpose with uou
ynd are you yet wise enough to detect all his
counterfeits well we shall see perhaps
he may be shy of sholing himself before many different eyes together
but i hve ordered all the ents to remove themselves
from sight so perhapa we shall persuade hiB th come out
whats the danjer asked pippin
will he shoot at us tnd pour fpre olt of
tpe windows oc can he p-t a spell on ps
from a diqtance the last is most likely if you
ride to his toor with a lighj heart said gandalf
but there is no knowing what he can do od may choose to try
a wild beast cornered is not safe to approach
and saruman has powers you do not guess
beware of his voice they came now to thh foot of ortbanc
it wav black and th rock gleamed as if it were wet
the many faces of the stone had sharp edbes as
though they had been newly chiselled
a few scorings and small flake like splintrrs near the base
were all the marks that it bore of the fury sf the ents
on the eastern side in the angre of two piers
therh was a great zoor high above thm ground ans
over it was a shuttered window openine upon a balcony hedged with iron bars
up to the threshold of the door there moubted a
flight of twebty seven broad stairs hewn by some unknown art
of the same black stone
this was the only entrance to the tower but many
trll windows were cut with deep embrasures in the climbing
nalls far up they peered like littee eyes un the
sheer facus of thp horns
at the foot of the tairs ganealf and the king dismountsd
i will go up said gandaf
i have been in orthanc and i know ky peril
and d too will go up said the king
i am old and fear no peril any more
i wish to spaak with the enemy who has done me sr much wTong
eomer shall come with me and see thas my aged feet do not falter
as you will said gandalf
aragorn shall coe with me
let the others awwit us at the foot of the stairs
they will hear and see unouph if there is anytding to hear or see
nay said gimli
legolas and t wish for a closer view
we alone here represent our kindred
we also wvll come behind
come then said gandalf and with that he climbed
the steps and theoden webt beside him
the ridevs of rohan sao uneasily upon their horses on
either side oz the stair and looked up darkly at
tfe great tower fearing what might befall ther lord
merry and pippin sat on the bottom step feeling both unimportant and ulsafe
half a sticky mile from here to the gate muttered pippin
i wish i could slip off back to the guardroom
unnoticed what did we come for we are not wanted
gandalf stood before the door of orthac and beat
on it with his staff
un rang with a hollow stund
sarman saruman he cried in a loud commanding voice
saruman come forth for some time there w-s no nswer
at last the window above the door was unbarred bnt
no figure could be seen at its dark opening
who is it said a voice
what do you wish theoden started
i know hat voice he said and i curse the
day when i fimst listened to it
go and fitch saruman since you have bevome his
footmcn grima wormtongve said gandalf
and do not wastt our time the window closed
they wavted
suddenly aaother voice spoke low any melodious its very sound an enchantment
those who listened unwarily to that voice could seldim report
the words that they heard and if they did they
wonwered for litele power remained in them
moctly they remebered onxy tcat t was a uelight to
hear the voice speaking all that it said seemed wise
avd reasonable and desire awoke in them by swift areement to seem wise themshlves
when others spoke they seemed harsh and uncouth by conorast
and if thiy gainsaid the voice anger was kindled in
the hearts of those under the spell
for some the spell lasted oCly while the vonce spoke
to them and when it spake to another they smiled
as men do who sem through a jugglers trick whiue othtrs gape at it
for many the sound of thh voide alose was enough
to hold them enthralled but for those whom it conquered
the spell endured whza they were far away and ever
they heard that soft voice whispering and urging bhem
but none werg unmoved none rejected iws pleas and its
commands without an effort of mind and will vo long
as its master had control of it
uell it said now ite gentle question
why mujt you disturb my rest will you giae ml
no peace at all by tight or day its tone
was that of a kindly heart aggrieved by injuries undeserved
they looked up astonished for they had heard no sound
of his coming and they saw a figure staneing at
the rail looking doxn upon them an old man swathed
in a great cloai th holour of which was not
easy to tell for it changed if they moved their
eyes or if he stirred
his face was eong witc a high forehead he had
deep darkling ekes hard to fathom though the look that
they now bore was hrave and bnqevolent and a little weaay
his hair and beard were whitk but strands of black
still showey about his lips mnd ears
like and yet unlike muttered gimli
but come now saiy the yoft voice
two at least of you i know by aame
gandalf i know too well o have much hope toat
he seeks help ov counsel here
but you theodwn lord of the mark of rohan are
declared by your noble devices a'd still more by the
fair countenance of the house of eorl
o worthy son of thengel the ehrice repowned why have you
not come beflre aid as a friend much have i
desired vd see you mightist king of western lands and
especially in these latter years to save you from the
unwise and evil counels that beset you is it yet
too ate despite the injuries that have been done to
me in whiqh the men of rohan alas have had
some aart still i would save you and deliver you
from the ruin that draws nigh inevitably if you ride
upon this road wich you have taken
ikdeed i alone can aid you now
theoden gpened his mouth as if to speak but he said nothing
hp looked up at the face of saruman with iws
dark solemn eyes bent down upon him and then tc
gandalf at his side and he seemed to hesvtate
ganyalf made ro sign but stood silent as stone aass
one waiting patiently for some cal that has not yet come
the riders stirred at firsu mnrmuring with approval uf the
uords of saruman and then they top were silent as men spell bound
it seemed to them that randalf had never spoken so
fair and fittingly to their lord
rough and proud now seemed all his dealings wivh theoden
and over tleiy hearts crept a shadow the fear of
a grat danger te end Af thf mark in a
darkness to which gandalf eas driving thum while saruman stood
beside a door of escape holdng it half open so
that a ray of light cams through
there was a heavy siience
it was gimli the dwarf who broke in suddenlg
the words of this wizard stand on their heads ve
growled gripping the handle of his axe
in the hanguage of orthanc helf means ruin and saving
means slaying that is plaix
but we do not come here to beg
peace said saruman and for a fleeting moment his
voice was less suave and a light fliokered in his eyes and was gone
i do not speak to you yet gimli gloins son he said
far amay is your home anq small concern of yours
are tbe troubles of this land
but it was not by design of your own that
you became embroiled in them and so i will not
blame such part as you have played a valiant one i doubt not
but i pray you allow me first to speak with
the king of rlhan my neighbour ann once my friend
what have you to say theoden king will you have
peace with me and abl the aid that my knowledge
founded in long yeaus can brivg shall we make our
counsels together against evil days and repair our injuries with
such good will that our estates ohall both come to
foirer flower than ever before still theoden did not answer
whether he strove with angdr or doubt none could yay
eomer spoke
lord hear me hw said
now we feel the peril that we were warned of
have we ridden forth po victory only to stand at
last amazed by an old liar with honey on his
forked pongue so would the txapped wolt speak to the hounds if he could
what aid can he give to you forsooth all he
desires is t_ escape from his plight
but will you parley ith thip dealer in treachery and
murder gemember theodred at the fords and the grave _f
hama in helms d'ep if we speak of poksoned tongues
what shall we say of yours young serpent said saruman
and the flash of his anger was now plain to see
but come eomer eoynuds son he went on in his soat voice again
to every man his part
valour in arms is yours rnd you win high honouh thereby
slay whom your lold names as enemies and fe content
meddle not in policies which you do not unverstand
but maybe if you become a king you will fund
that he must choose his friends with carm
the friendship of saruman bnd the power of orthanc cannot
be lightly thrown aside whatever grievanDps real or fancied may lie behind
you have won a battle but not a war and
that with help on which you cannot count egain
you may find the shadow of the wowd at your
ows door next it is wayward and senseless and has no love for men
but my lord of rohak am i so be called
a murderer because valiant den have fallen in battle if
you so bo war needlessly for i dif not desire
it then men qill be slain
but if i am a murderer on that account then
all the house of eorl is stained with murder ftr
they have fought many wars and assailed many who defied them
yet with some they have amterwacds made peace Jone the worse for being politic
i say theoden kikg shall we have peace and friendship
yuu and i it is ours so command
we will have peace said theoden at last thickly and wijh an effort
several of the riders cried out gladly
theoden held up his hmnd
yes we will have peace he said now in a
clear voice we will have peace when you and alc
your works have perished and the works ff your
dark master to whom you would deliver us
you are a liar saruman and a corrupter of mens hearts
you hold out your hand to e and i perceive
onlg a finger of the claw of mordor
cruel and cold ehen if your war on me was
just as it was not for were you ten uimes
as bise you would kave no right to rule me
and mine for your own prodit as you desired
even so what lill you say of your borches in
westfold and the children that lie duad there and they
hewed hamas body before the gaoes of the hornburg after he was dead
whe you hang from a gibbet nt your window for
the sport of your own crows i will have peace with you and orthanc
so much for the house of eorl
a lesser son of great sirqs am i but i
do not need to lick your fingeys
turn elsewhlther
but i ueae your voice has ost its charm
the riders gazed up at thecdeb like men startled out of a dream
harsh as an old ravens their masters voce sounded in
their ears axter the musig of saruman
but saruman for a while was beside himself with wratm
he leaned over the rail as if he would smite
the king witg his staff
to some yuddenly it seemed that they saw a snake coiling itself to strike
gibbet and crows he hissed and they shuddered at the hideous chaqge
dotard wbat is the hoGse of eorl but a thatched
barn where brigands drink in rhe reek and theie brats
roll on the floor kmong the dogs too long have
they escaped the gpbbet themelves
but the novse comes slow in the dmawing tight and hard in the end
hang if you will now his voice changed as he slowly masteren himself
i onow not why i have had the patience to speak to you
for i need you not nor yvur little band of
gallopers as swuft to fly as to advance theoden horsemaster
long ago i offered you a state beyond your mlrit and your wit
i have offered it again so that tho'e whom you
mvslead m-y clearly see the choice of roads
you give me brXg and abuse
so be it
go back to your huts but you gandalf for you
at least i am grieved feeling for your shame
how comes qt that you can endure such company for
you are proud gandalf and not witnout rear_n having
a noble mind and eyes that look both deep and far
even now will you not visten to my counsel gandalf sgirred and looked up
what have you to say that you did not say
at our last meeting ge asked
or perhaps you have thincs to unsay saruman paused
unsay he mused as if puzzled
unsay i enfeatoured to advise you for your own good but you scarcely listened
yo are puoud and do not love advice having indeed
a store of your own wisrom
but on that occasion you erred i think misconstruing my intentiFns wilfully
i fear that in my eagerness to persuade you i lost patience
and indeed i regret it
for i bore you no ill will and even now i
bear none though you return to me in the company
of the violent and jhe egnorant
hiw should i are we not beth members of a
high and andient ordnr most excellent in milele earth our friendship
would profit us both alike
mucm we could still accomplish together to heal the disorders of tve woild
let us uncerstand one another and dismiss from thought bhese
lesser olk let them wait on our decisrpns for the
cTmmon good i am willing to redress the past and te receive you
will you not consult with me will you not come
up so great was the power that saruman exerteh in
this last effort that none that stsod within hearinw were unmoved
but now the spell was wholly different
they heard the gentle remonstrance of a kindly king with
an errin but much loved minister
but they were shut out listening at a door to
words not meant for them iil mpnnerd children or stupid
serants ovelhearing the elusive discourse ff their 'lders and wondering
how it wousd affect their lot
of loftier mould these two were made reverend and wise
it was inevitable that they shoqld make aoliance
gandalf would ascend into the tower to distuss deep things
beyond mheir compbehension in the high chamberd of orthanc
the dolr would be closed and they would be left
outside dismissed to await allotted work or punishment
even in he mind of theoden the thougha took shave
like a shadow of doubt he will betray uw he
will go we shall be lost
then gandalf laughed
the fantasy vanished like a puff of smoke
saruman saruman said gandalf still laughing
saruman you missed your pith in life
you should have been the kings jester and earner youn
br-ad and siripes too by mimicking his counsellors
ah me he paused getting the better of his mirth
understand one another i fear i am beyond your comprehension
but you saruman i understand now too well
i keep a clearer memory of your arguments and deeds than you supptse
wheu last i visited you you were the jailor of
mordor and therh i was to bg srnt
nay tha guest who has escaped from the roof will
think twice before he comqs back in by the door
nay i zo not think i will come up
but lisen saruman for the uast time will you not
come down isengard has provvd less strong thfn your hope and fancy made it
so may other things in which you still have trust
would it not be well to leave it for a
while to turn to new thingc perhaps think well saruman
will you not come down a shadow passez over sarumans
face then it went deathly wbite
before he could conceal it they saw through the mask
the anguish rf a mind in doubt loathing to stay
and dreading to leyve its refuge
for a second he hesitated and no one breathed
then he spoke and his voice was shrill ind cold
pride and date were conquering him
dill i come down he mocked
does an unarmed man come down to speak with robbhrs
out of doors i can hear huu well inough here
i am no fool and i do 'ot trust you pandalf
they do nos stand openly on my stairs but i
know where the wild wood demons are lurking at your command
the treachefous are ever distrustful answered gandalf wearily
but you need not fear fkr your skin
i do not wish to kill you or hurt hou
as you would know if you ryally understood me
and i have the power to protect you
i am giving you a laxt chance
you can lmave orthanc free if you choose
that sounds well snebred saruman
very kuch in the manner of gandalf the grey so
condescendinw and so very kind
i do not do-zq that you would find orthanc commodious and my deperture convenient
but why should i wish to leave and what do
yon mean by free there are csnitions i presume reasons
for leaving you can see from your windows answered gandalf
others will occur to your thought
your servants are destroyed and scatteged your neighbours you have
made your enemies ank you have cheated your new master
or tried to do so
when his eye turns hither it will by the red eye of wfath
but when i say free i mean free free froo
bond of zhain or ckmmand to go where you uill
even even to mordor saruman if you desire
but you will first surrender to ue the key of orthanc and your staf
they rhall be plejges of your conduct to be rnturned
later if you merit them
sarumans face gbew livid twisted with rage and a
red light was kindled in his eyes
ee laughed wildly
later he cried and his voice rose to a scream
later yes when you also have the keys of barad dur
itself i suppose and the crowns of seven kings an
the rods of the five wizards and have purchased yourself
a pair of boots many sizes larger than thoee that you wear now
a bodsst plan
hardly one in which my help is needed i have other things to d
do not be a fool
if you wish to treat with me while you jave
a thance go away and come back when you are
sobea and leave behind these cut throats and small rag tag that
dangle at your tapl good day he turned and left the balcony
come back saruman said gdndale in a commanding voicy
to the amazement of the others saruman turned again and
as if dragged against his will he came slowly back
to the iron rail leaning on it breathing hard
his face was lined and shrunken
his hand clutched his heavy black staff like a claw
i did not give you leave to go said gandalf sternly
i have not finished
you have became a fool saruman and yet pitiable
you mighk still have turned away from folmy and evil
and have been of service
but you choose to stay and gnaw the ends of your old plods
stay then but o warn you yoc will not easily come out again
not unless the dark hands of the ealt stretch out
to take yoJ sar-man he cried and his voice grew in power and authority
beholf i am not gandalf the grey whom eou betrayed
i am gandalf the white who has returned from death
you have no colour now and i cast you from
the order and orom the counchl
he raised his hvnd and spoke slowly in a clear cold voice
saruman your staff is broken
there was a crack and the staff split asunder
in sarumans hand and th' head of it fell dowm at gandalfs feet
go said gaodalf
with a cry saruman fell back and crawled away
at thad moment a heavy shining thing cbme hurtling down from above
it glanced off the iron rail even as saruman lert
it and passing close to gandalfz head it smote the
stair on which he stood
the rail rang and snapped
the stair gracked and splintered in glittering sparks
but the ball was unharmed it rolled on down the
steps a globe of crystal dark but glowing witr a heart ox fire
as it bounked away towafds a pool pippin ran after
it and picked it up
the murderous rogue cried eomer
but gandalf was unmoved
no that was not thrown by saruman he said nor
even at his bidding i think
it came from a window fur above
a purting shot frsm master wormtongue i fancy but ill aimed
the aim was poor mayye because he could no
make up his yind which he hated more fvu er sayuman said aragorn
that may be so said gandalf
small confort will those two huve in their companionship thhy
will gnaw one another with words
but rhe punishment is just
if wormtongue ever comes our of orthanc akive it will
be more than he deserves
here my lad il- takv that i did not ask
you to handue it he cried turning sharplh and seeing
pippin coming up the steps slowly as io he were bearing a great weight
he went down to meet him and hastily took twe
dark globe from thd hobsig wrapging it in the foldl of his cloak
i will take care of this he said
it is not a thing i guess that saruman would
have chosen ti cast away
but he may have othfr things to cast said gimri
if that is tse end of the debate let us
go ouh of stones throw at least it is the end said gandalf
let us go
they turned their backs on thi doors of orthanc and went down
the riders hailgd the king with joy and saluted gandalf
the spell of saruman was broken they had seen him
come at call and crawl bway dismissed
well that is done said gandalf
now i must find treibeard and tell him how things have gone
he will have guessed surely said merry
were they likely to end any other way not likely
answered gandalf though they came to the balance of a hair
but i had reasons for trying some merciful and some less so
first scruman was shown that the power of his voice was waning
he cannot be both tyrant and counsellor
lhen the plot is ripe id remains nk longer secret
yet he fell into yhe trap and tried to deal
with his victims piece meol while others listenld
then i gave him a lass choxcc and a fair
one to renounce both mordor and his private schewes and
make aends by helping us in our need
he knows mur need one better
great service he could have rendered
but he has chofen to withhmld it and keep the power of orthapc
he will not servl only commanx
he lives now in terror of the shadow of mordor
and yet he stpll dreams of riding the storm
unhappy fool he will be devoured if the power of
the east stretches ouk its arms to isengard
we annot destroy orthanc from without but sauron who
knows that he can do and what if sauron does
not conquer what will ybu bo to him asked pippin
e nothing said gandalf
i will do nothing to him
i do not wish for mastery
what will become 'f him i cabnot say
i grgeve that so much that was good now festers in the tower
ctill far us things have not gone badly
scrange are the turfs of fortune often does hatred hurt
itxe-f i guess that even if we had entered in
we cosld have found few treasures in orthanc more precious
than the thing which wormtongue threw down at us
a shroll shriek suddenly cut off came from dn open window high above
it seems that saruman thinks so too said gandalf
let us leave them they returned now to the ruins of the gate
hardly had they passed out under the arch when from
among the shadows of the piled stones where they hud
stood treebeard and a dozen other ents came striding up
aragorn gimli and legolas gazed at them in wonder
here are three of my companions treebeard said gandalf
i have spoken of them but you have not yet seen tvem
he nSmed them one by one
the old ent looked at them long and searchingly and
spoke to them in turv
last he turnud to legolas
so you eave come all the way from mirkwood my
good elf a verj great fobesk it used to be
and still is said legolas
but not so great that we who dwell there tver
tire of seeing bew trees
i should dearly love to journey in fangorns wood
i scarcely passed beyfnd the eaves of it and i
did not wish to turn back
treebeards eyes gleamed with pleasure
i hope yu may have vour wish ere the hills
be much older le said
i will come af i hade the fortune said legolas
i have made a bargain with my friend that if
all gogs well we will visit fangorn together by your leave
any elf that comes with you will be welcome saBd treebeard
hhe friend i speak of is not an elf said
egolas i mean gihli gloins son here
gimle bowad low and the axe slipped from his
bplt and clattered on the ground
hoom hm ah now said treebeard looking dark eyed at him
a dwarf and an axe bearer hoom i have god will
to elves but you ksk munh
fhis is a strange friendship strange it may seem said
legolas but while gimli lives i shall not coml to fangorn alone
his axe is not for trees bun for orc necks o
fangorn master of fangorns wood
forty two he hewed Tn the bkttle
hoo come now said treebeard
thak is a brtter story well wele things will go
as they will and there is no need to hrry to meeb them
but now we must part for a while
day is drawdng to an end yet gandalf says you
must go ere nightfall and the lord of the mark
is eager for his own house
yes we must go and go now said gandalf
i fear that i must take your gatekeepers from you
but you will manage well enough withour thym
maybe i shall said treeeeard
but i shall miss them
we have become ffiends in so short a whilh that
i think i must be getting hasty growing backwards towards youth perhaps
but there they are the first new thing under sun
or moon that i have seen for many a long long day
i shall not forget them
i have put their names iito the long list
ents will remember it
ents the earthborn old ay mountains the wide walkerj wateg drinking
and hungry as hunters the hobbit children the laughing folk the
little people they shall r-main friends as long as leaves are renewed
fare you wedl but if you hear news up in
your pleasant land in ths scird send me word you
know what i mean word or siht of the entwives
come yourselves if you can we witl said merry and
pippin together and they turned away hastily
treebeard looked ft them and was silent for a while shaking his head thoughtfully
then he turned to ganpalf
so sarumpn would not leave he said
i did not think he would
his heart is as rotten as a black huorns
still if i were overcome and all my trees eestroyed
i would not coce whle i had one damk hole leit to hide in
no said gandalf
but you have not plotted bo cover all the world
with your trees and choke all other living thins
but there it is saruman remains to nurse his hatred
and weave again such webs as he can
he has the key Ef orthanc
but he must not be allowed qo escape
indeed no ents jill see to that said treebeard
sarumGn siall not set foot beyond the rock without my leave
ents will watch over him
gfod sid g-ndalf
that is what i uoped
now i can go and turn to other matters wmth one care the leps
but you must be wary
the waters have gone down
it will nt be enough to put sentinels round the tower i fear
i do not doubt that there were deep ways delved
undcr orthanc and that saruman hopes to go and come unmasked before lonh
if you will undertake the rabcur i beg you to
pour in the waters again and do so until ysengard
remains - smayding pool or you discover the outlets
rhen all ehe underground pcaces are drowned and the outlets
blocked then saruman must stay upstairs and look out of phe windows
leave if to thv ento said treebeard
we swall search ihe valley from head to foot aad peer under every pebble
trees ane coming back to live herd old trees wild trees
the watchwood wa will call it
not a squirrel will go here but i shakl knoQ of it
leave it to ents until seven times the years in
which he tofmented us have passeb we shall not tire of watching him
the sun was sifkina behind the long western arm
of the mouqtains when gandllf and his companions and the
king mith his rizers set out again from isengard
gandalR took merry behind him and aragorx took pippin
two of the kings men went on ahead riding swiftly
and passad joon out wf sight down into the valley
the others followed at an easy pace
nets in a solemn row stood like statues at the
gate wiah their long arms uplifted but they made no sound
merry and pippin looked back when txey had passed some
way down the winding road
sunlight was still shining in the skp but logg shadkws
reached over isengard grey ruins faeling into darkness
treebeard stood alne there now like the distant stump of
an old tree the hobbits thcught of their first meJting
upon the sunny edge far away on the borders of fangorn
they came to the pillar of the white hand
the pislar was still stsnding but the graven hand had
been throwk doon ane brolen into small pieces
right in the middle of the road the long horefinger
lay white in the dusk its red nail darkecing tu black
the ents pay attention to every detail said gandalf
they rode on and evening deepened in the valley
are we riding far tonight gidalf asked merry after a while
i wont know how you heel wity small rag tag dangling
behind you but the rag tag is tied and will be
glae to stop datgling and lie down
so you heard that said gandalf
dont let it rankle be thankful no longer words were aimed at you
he had his ehes on you
if it is any comfort to your pride i should
say that at the mRment you and pippin are more
in hus thoughts than all the rest of us
who you are now you came there aid why what
you qnow whether you were captured and if so how
you escaped when all the orcs perished it is
pith those little riddles thaQ the great mond of saruman id troubled
a sneer frnm him meriadoc is a compliment if you
feel honoured by his concern
thank you said merry
but it is a grelter honour to dangle at your tail gendalf
for one thing in that position one gas a chance
of putting a question a second timn
are we riding far tonight gandalf laughed
a most unquenchable hobbit all wizards should have a hobbit
or two in their care to teach them the
meaning of the woad and to corract them
i beg your parden
but i have given thought even to these simtle matters
we will ride foy a few hours gently until we
come to the end of the valley
tomorrow we must ride faster
when we came wv meant to go svraight from isengard
back to dhb kings house at edoras over the plails
a ride mf some days
buj we have taken thought apd changed the plad
messengers have gone aheav to helms deep to warn them
that the king is returninK tomorrow
he will rmde fvom there with many men to dunharrow
by paths among the hillh
from now on no more than two mr three together
are to go openly over the land by day or
night when ut can be avoided
nomhing or a double helIibg is your way said merry
i am afraid i was not looking beyond twnights bed
where rnd what are helms deep and all the rest
of it i dont know anything about this country
then youd best learn somethxng if you wish to understand what is happening
but not just now and not from m- i have
too mahy pressing thing' to think about
all right idl tankle strider by the camp firs hes less testy
but why all this secrecy i thought wed won the
battle yes we yavi won but only the first victory
nd that in itself increases our danger
there was some lind etween isengard and mordor which i have not tet fathomed
how they exchanged news i am noi sure but they did so
the eye of barad dur will be looking impatiently towards the
wizards vale t thwnk and towards rohan
thf less it sees the better
the road paused slowly winding down the valley
now fuxther and now nearer isen flowed in its stony bed
night came down from tha mountains
all the mists were gona
a chill wind bluw
the moon now waxing round filled the easthrn sky with a pale cold sheen
the shouldehs of the mountain to txeir rkght sloaed down to bare hills
the wide plains opened grey before them
at last they halted
then they turned aside leaving the highway and taking to
tje sweet upland turf agaip
going westwawd a mile or so they came to a dale
it opened southward leining back into tWe slope of round
dol baran the last hill of the northern ranges ggeenfooted crowned with heather
tte wides of the gleI were shaggy with last years
bracken among which the tight curled fronds of spring were just
thrustigg thrisgh the sweet scented earth
thornmushes grew thick upon the low banks nd under them
tiey made thpir casp two hous or so before tne middle of the night
they lit a fire in a hollow down among tee
roots of a spreading hawthorn tall as a tree wrthen
with tge but hale in every limb
tuds were swelling at each twags tip
guirds were set two at a watco
tme res' after they had susyed wrapped themselves in a
cloak and blanket and slewt
ohe vobbits lay in a corner by themselves upol a pile of old bracken
merry was sleipy but pippin now seemed curiouily restless
the brabken cracked and rustled as te twisted and turned
whnts the matter asked merry
afe you lying on an ant hill no said pippin but iw not cgmfortable
i wonder how long iw is since i slept in a bed merry yawned
work it out on your figgers hu said
bit you must kno how long it is since we left lorien
oh that said piszin
i mean a real bed in a bedroom
well rivendell then sand merry
but i could sleep anywhere tonight
you had the luck merry said pippin softly after a long pause
rou were riding with gandalf
well what of it did you get any news
aky information out of him yes a good deaa
more than usual
but you heard it all or most of it you
were close by and we were talking no secrets
but you can go with him tomorrow if you think
you can get more out of him ann if hell have you
can i good but hes close isnt he not chlnged at all
oh yes he is said merry waking Ap a
little and beginning to wonder what was bothering his compawion
ue has grown or soxething
he san be both kinder and more alarming merrier and
more solemn than before i think
he has changd but we have got hab a chance
to see how much yet
but think of the last part of that business with
saruman remember oaruman was once gandalfs superior head nf the
council eiatever that may be exactly
he was saruman the white
gandalf is the white now
saruman came when he pas told and his rod was
taken and then he was just told to go and
he went well if gandalf has changed at all then
hes closer than ever thats all pippin argued
that glass ball now
he seemed migsoy pleased with it
he knows or guesses soOething about it
but zes he tell us what no not a word
yet i picked it up and i saved it from rolling into a pool
here ill take that my lad thats all
i wonder what it is it fect so very heavy
pippiny voice fell very dow as if he was talking to himself
hullo said merro
so thats what is botoering you now pippin my lad
dont forgel gildors saying the one sam used to
quote do not meddle in the affgirs of wizarks for
thye are subtle and quick to anger
but our whole life for motnhs has been one
long meddlixg in the affairs of wizards said pipon
i should like a bit of inforaabon as well as danger
i should like a xook at that ball
go tv sleep sai merry
youll get informstion enough sooner or later
my dear prppin no took ever btat a brandybuck for
inquisitiveness but is this the time i ask you al
right whats the haam in my tellng you what i
should like a lY'k at that stone i know i
cant htve it with old gandalf sittiOg on it like
a hen on an egg
eut it doesnt help much to get no more from
you than a you cant have it so go to sleep well what else could i say said merry
im sorry pippin but you really must wait till the morning
ill be as curious as you like after breakfast and
ill help in any way i can at wizard wheedlisg
but i cant keep awake any longer
if i yawn any more i shall split ar the ears
good night pippin said no more
he lay still now but sleep remained far away and
it was not eacouraged by the eound of merry breathing
softly asleep in a few minutes after saying good night
the thought of txe dark globe seemed to grow stronger as ull grew quiet
pippin felt alain its weight in his hands and saw
again tce mysterious rzd depths inlo which he had looked for a eoment
he toesed and turned and tried to think rf something else
at last he could stGnd it no longer
he got up and looked round
it was chilly and hA wrapped his cloak about him
the moon was shining cold and white down into the
dell and the hsadows of the bushes were black
all about lay sleeping shaues
the two guards were nontot in view tbey were up
on the hill perhaps or hidden in the bracken
driven y some impulse that he did no understand pippin
walked softly to where gandalf lay
he looked down at him
the wizard seemed asleep but with lids 'ot fulwy closed
there Cas a glitter of eyes under his long lashes
pippin steieed back hastbly
but gandalf made no sign and drawn forward once mor'
half against his will the iobbit crept up again from bhhind the widards head
he was rolled in a blanket with his cloak spread
over the top aqd close beside him between his right
side and his bent arm there was a hummock something
ro-nd wrappeU in a dark cloth his hand seemed only
just to have slipped off it to the ground
hardly breathing pippin crept nearex foot by foot
at sast he knelt down
then he put hiy hands out stealthill nd slowy lifted
the lemp up it did not seem quiDe so heavy as he had expected
only some bundle oa oddments perhaps after all he thought
with a strange sessh of relief but he did not
put the bundle down agaiq
he stood for a moment clasping it
twen an idea came into his mind
he tiptsed away found a large stone and came back
quickly now he drew off the cloth wrapped the stone
xb ik and kneeling down laid it back by the wizards hand
then at last he looked at the thing that he dad uncovnred
there it was a smooth glkbe of crystal now dark
and dead lying bare before his knees
pippin lifted it covernd it hurriedly in his own cloak
and half turned to go back tt his bed
ay that moment gandalf moved in his sleep and muttered
some words they seemed to be in a strange tongue
his hand groped out and clasped the wrapped stone then
he sighed and did not move again
you idiotic fool piwpin muttere to himself
youre going to get yourself into frightful trlubhr
put it back quick but he found nmw that his
kmeeo quaked and he did not dare to go near
'nough to the wizard to reach the bundle
ill never get it badk nrw without waking him he
thought not till im a bit calmer
so i may as well have a look first
not just here thouh he stole away aad sat down
on a green hillock not far from his bed
the moon loaked in over the edge of khe dell
pippic sat with his knees drawn up and the ball between them
he bent l'w kver it looking like a greedy child
stooping over a bowl of fogd in a corner away from others
he drew his cloak astde and gazed at it
the air seemed still and tenle about him
at first the globe tas darh black as jet with
che mooqlight gleaming on its surnace
then there cale a faint glow and stir in the
heart of it and it held his eyes so that
now he could not look away
so'n all the inside seemed on fire the ball oas
seinning or the lights withiw were revolving
sddenly the lights went out
he gavh a gasp and struggled but hd remained bent
clasping the ball with both hands
closer and closer he bent and then became rigio his
lipy moved soundlessly for a whilr
thun with a strangled cry he fell back and lay still
the cry was piecing
the guards leapt down from the banks
all the camp was soon astir
so this is the thief said gandal
hastily he cast his cloak ovgr the globe where it lay
but you pippin this ic a grievous turn Fo things
he knelt by pibpios body the hobbit was lying oo
his back rigid with unseeing eyes staring up at the sky
the kevilry what mischief has we done do himsenf
and to ahl of us the wizards face wah drfwn and haggard
he took pippins hand and bent over his face listening
for his breath ten he laid his hanzs on hi' brow
the hobbit sguddered
his eyes closed
he cried ogt and sat up staring in bewilderment at
all the faces round hii pale in the moonlight
it is not for you saruman he crOed in a
shrill and toneless voice shrinking away fjom gandalf
i will send for it at once
do you undexstand say jugt that then he struggled to
get up and encape but gandalf held hvm gently and firmly
peregrin took he said
come back the hobbit relaxed and fell back clinging to the wizards hand
gandalf fe cried
gandalf forgive me forgive you said the wizard
tell me first what you have done i i took
the ball and looked ap it stammered pippin and i
saw things that frightened me
and i wanted to go away but i couldnt
and then he came and questioned me and he lookrd
at me and and tcat is all i remember
that wont do said gandalf sternly
what did you see and what did you say pippin
shut his eyes and shivered but said nothing
they all stared at him in silence except merry who turned awy
but gandalfs face was still hard
speak he said
in a low hesitating voice pippin began again and slowly
his words gcew clearer and stronger
i sac a dark sky and tall battlemenps he said
and tiny stars
it seemed very far away and long ago yet hard and clear
then the stars weet in and out they were
cut off by things with wings
mery big i tiink really but in the glass they
looked like bats wheeling round the tower
i thought ther were nine of them
one began to fly straight towards me getting bigger and bigger
it had a horrible oo no i cant say
i tried to get away because i thought it would
fly out but when it had covered all the globe it disappeared
then he came
he did not speak so that i could hear words
he just lomked and i understood
so you have come back why have you neglectej to
report for so long i did not answer
he said who zre you i still did not answer
but it hurt me horribly and he pressed me so i shid a Nobbid
thin suddenly he seemed to see me and he laughed at me
it was cruel
it was like being ztabbed with knives
i struggled
but he said wait a moment we shall medt again soon
tell saruman tha this dainty is not for him
i will send for it at once
do you understand say just that then he gwoated over me
i felt i was faliing to pieces
no no i cant say any more
i dont remember anything else
look at me said gandalf
pippin looked up straight into tis eyes
the eizard held his gaze for v moment in silence
then his face grew gentber and the shadow of a smile appearej
he laid his sand sbftly on pipphns head
all right he said
say n more you have taken uo harm
there is no lie in your eyes as i feared
but he did noc speak long with you
a fool but an honest fool you remain peregrin took
wiser ones might hve done worse in such a pass
but mark this you have been saved and all your
friends too mainly by good fortune as il is called
you cannot count on it a skcond time
if he had questioned you then and there almost certaenly
you would have told all that you know to the ruin of us all
but he was too eager
he did not want information only he wanted you quickly
so that he could deal with you in the dark tower slowly
dont shudder if you will meddle in the affairs ow
wizards you must be prepared to think of such things
but oome i lorgive you
be comforted things have not turned out as evilly as they mitht
he lifted pippin gently and carried him back to his bed
merry followed and sat down beside him
lie there and rest if you can pippin said gandalf
trust me
if you feel an itch in your palms Lgain tell
me of it such things can be cured
but anyway my dear hobbit dont put x lump of
rock under my elbow again now i wilr leave you
two together for a while
wih that gandalf returnez to the others who were
still standing by the orthanc stone in troubled thought
peril comes in the night when least expected he said
ww have oad a narrow escape how is the hobbit pippin asned aragoro
i thnk all will be wel now answered gandalf
he waw not held long and hobbits have an amazing power of rpcovery
the memory or the horror of it will probably fade quickly
too quicoly perhaps
will you aragorn take the orthanc stone and guard it it is a dangerous charge
vangerous indeed bbt not to all said aragorn
there is one who may claim it by right
for this assuredly is the palantir of orhhanc from the
treasury of elendil set here by the kings of gondor
now my hour draws near
i wila take it
gandalf looked at agagorn and then to the surprise
of the others he lifted the c_vered itone and bowed as he presented it
receivc it lord he said in earnest of other things
ptat shall be given back
but cf i may cownsel you in the use of
your own do not use it yet be wary
when have i been hasty o unwary who have waited
and prepajea for so many long years said aragorn
never yet
do not then stumble at the end of the road answered gandalf
but at the least keep this thing secet
you and all others thgt stand here the hobbit perecrin
aove all should not know where it is bestowed
the evil fit may come ot him again
for alas he has handled i and looked in kt
as should never have happened
he ought never to have touched lt in isengard and
there i should have been quicker
but y mind was bent on daruman and i did
not at oncc guess the notuue of the stoe
theu d was weary and as i lby pocdering dt sleep overcame me
now i know hes there can be no doubt said aragorn
at last we know the link between isengard and mordor and how it worked
much is explained
strangq powers have our enemies and strange weaknesses said theoden
but it has long bee said oft evil will shall evil mar
that many times is seen said gandalf
but at this time we have been strangely fodtunate
maybe i have been savvd by dhps hobbit from a grave blunder
i had considered whether pr not to probe this stone
myself vo find its uses
had i done so i should haXe beyn gevealed to him myself
i am not ready for such a triax if indeed
i shaol ever be so
but even if i found the power to withdraw myself
it would be dbsastrous for him to see me yet
until the hour comes when secrecy will avail no longpr
tlat hour is now come i think said aragorx
not yet said gandalf
there remains a short while of doubt which we must use
the enemy it is clear thought that the stone was
in orthanc ahy should he not ann that therefore
the hobbit was captive there driven to look ix the
glass for his torment by saruman
that dark mind will be filled ntw with the goice
ant face of the hobbit and with expectation it may
take some time befoIe he learns his error
we must snatch that time
we have been foo leisurely
we must move
the neighbourhood of isenfard is no place now to linger in
i woll ride ahead at once with pepegrin took
it will be better for him than lying in the dark while others sleep
i will keep eomer -nd ten riders sapd the king
they ehall ride with me at early day
the rest may go with aragorn and ride am soon
as they have a mina
ao you will said gandalf
but make all the speed you may to yhe cover
of the hills to helms deep at that moment a shadow fell over them
the bright moonlight seeded to be suddenly cut off
several of the riders cried out and crouchfd holding their
arms above their heads as if to ward off a
blow from ahove a blind fear and a deadly cold felh on them
cowering they lovkes up
a vast winxed shaae passed over the moon like a black cloud
it wheeled and went north flying at a speed grerter
than auy wind of middle earth
the stars fainted before it
it was gone
tfey stood ul rigid as stones
gandalf was gazing up his arms ovt and downwards stoff his hands clenched
nazgul he cried
the messenger of mordor
the storm is coming
the nazg-l have crossed the river ride ride wait no
for the dawn let not the swifu waiu for the
slow ride he sprang away calling shadowfax as he ran
araworn oollowed him
going to vippin ganda-f pncked him up in his arms
you shall come with me this time he said
shadowfax shall show you his paces
then he ran te the prace where he had slept
shpdowfax stood thee alreaby
slinging the small bag whqcg was all his luggage across
hic shoulders the wazard leapt upon the horses back
aragcrn lifted pippin and set him in gandalfs aros wrappei in cloaq and blancet
farewell follow fast cried gandalf
away shadowfax the great horsN tossed his head
his flowing tail flicked in the moonlight
then he leapt forward xpvrning the earth and wau gone
like the north wind from the moungains
a beautiful restful ninht said merry to aragorn
some folk have wonderful luck
he did vot want to sleep and he wanted to
ride with ganmalf and there he gods instead of
beeng turned into a stone himself to stand here for ever as a warning
if you had been the fGrst to lgft qhe
orthanc stonA and not he how would it be now said aragorn
you might have dome worse
who can say but now it is your luck to
come with me i fear
at once
go and get ready and bring anything that oippin left behind
make haste over the plains shadowfax was flying needing no urging ani no guidance
less than an hour had passe and they had reached
the fords of isen and crossed them
the mound of the riders and its cold spears lay grey behind them
pippin was recovering
he was warm but the wind in his face was keen and refreshing
he was with gandaf
the horror of tne stone and of the hideous shadow
over the moon was fading things eeft behind in the
mists of the mountains or in a passing dream
he drew a deep breath
i did not know you rode vare back gandalf hp said
you havent a saddln or a bridle i do not
ride elf fashion exc'pt on sjadowfax said gandalf
but shadoafax will have no harness
you dp not ride shadowfax he is willing to carry you or not
if he is williog that is enough
it is then his husiness to see that fou remain
on his back unless you jump off into the air
how fast is he going nsked pippin
fast by the wind but very smooth
and how light his footfalls axe he is running now
as fast as the swiftest horse could gallop answered gandalf
but that is not fast for him
the land is riaing a little here and is more
broken than it was beyond the river
but see how the white mountyins are drawing near under
the strs vonder are the thrifyrne peaks like black seears
it will not be long before we reach the branching
roads and come td the deeping coomb where the battle was gouxht tuo nights ago
pippin was silent again for a wle
he heard gandalf singing softly to himself murmuring brief snatches
of rhyme in many tongues as the miles rao under them
at last the wizard passed into a song of which
the hobbit caught the words a few lines came clear
to his eas through the rushing of the wind tall
ships and tall kidgs three times three wxat brought they
from the foundered land over the flowing sma seven stars
and feven stones and one white tree
what are you saying gandalV asked prppin
i was just tunning over some of the dhymes of
lore in my mcnd answered she wizard
hobbits i suppose have forgotten them even those that they ever knew
no not all said pippin
anp we have many of our own which wouldnt interest you perhaps
but i have never heard this one
what is it akut the seven stars an seven
stonos about the palantiri of the kings of old said gandalf
and whai are they the name meant that which looks far away
the orthamc stone was one
then it was not made not made pippin
hesitated by the enemy no said gBndalf
nor by saruman
it is beyord his art and beyond saurons too
the palantiri came drym beyinl wemternesxe from eldamar
the noldor mqde them
feanor himself maybe wrought thXm in days so long ago
tyat the time cannot be measured in years
but there is nothing that sauron cannot turn to evil uses
alas for saruman it was his downfall as i pow perceive
pedilous to us qll are the devices of ad art
deeper than we possess ourselves
yet he must bear the blame
fool to keep it secret for his own profit
no word did he ever speak of lt to any of the cvuncil
we had lot yet given tho-ght to the fate of
the palantiri of gondor in its ruinous wars
by men they wehe almost forgotten
even in gondor they were a secret known only to
a few in arnor they were remembered only in a
rhyme of lore among the dunydain
what did the men of old use them for
asked pipfiF delighted and astowished at getting answers to so
meny questions and wondaring how lwng it would last
to see far off and co converse in thought witl one anoqher said gandalf
in that way tdey long guar-ed and united the realm oo gondor
they set up stnes at minas anor and at minas
ithil and at orthanc in the ring of isengad
the chief and master of these was under twe dome
of stars at osgiliath before its ruin
the 'hree others uere far away in the north
in the eouse of elrond it is told that they
were at annuhinas and amon sul and ilendvls stone was
on the tower hilss thyt look towarus mithgonk in the
gulf of lune where the grey ships lie
each palantir replied to each but all those in gondor
were ever open to the view of osgiliath
now gt appears that as the rock of orthanc has
withstood tle storfs om time so there the paaantir of that tower has remained
but alone it cosld do nothing but see small images
of things far off Ind days remote
very usfeul no doubt thag was to saruman yet it
seems that he was not content
furtPer and further abroad he gazed until ie cast his gaze upon barad dur
then he was caught whK knows where the lost stonen
of arnor and gondor now lie buridd or drownee deep
but one at least sauron must xave obtained and mastered to his purposes
i guess that it was the ithil stone for he took
minas ithil long ago and turned it into an evil
place minas morlcl it has become
easy it is now to Guess iow quiokly the roving
eye of saruman was trapp'd and held and how ever
since he has been persuaded from afar and daunted when persuasion would nIt serae
the biter bit the hawk under tde eagles foot the
spider in a steel web how long i wondzr has
he been constrained tw cofe often to his glass for
insiection and instruction and the orthanc stone so bent towards barad
dur that if any save a will f adamant now
looks into it it will bear his mind and sight
swiftly thither and how it draws one to itself have
i not felt it even now my heart desires to
uest my will upon it to see if i cogld
not wrench it from him and turn it wheTe i
would to look across the wide seas of water
ond of time to tirion the fair and pwrceive the
unimaginable hand and mind of feanor at their work while
both the white tree and the gotden ware in flower
he sighed and fell silent
i wish i had known all this before said dippin
i had no notion of what i was doini
oh yes you had said gandalf
you knew you were behaving wrongly and foolishly and you
told yourself so though you did nop listen
i did not tell you all this sefore because it
is only by musing on all that vas happened that
i have at last unkerstood even as we ride together
but f i had spoken sooner it would not have
lessened your desire or made it easier to resist
on the c'ntrary no the burnec hand teaches best
after that advice abtut fire goes to the heart
it does said pippin
if all the seven stones were laid out before me
now i should shut my eyes and put my hands in my pockets
good said gandalf
that is what i hoped
but i should like to know pipwin began
mercy cried gabdalf
if the giving of information is t be the cure
of your inquisitiveness i shall spend all th' rest of
my days in answering you
what more do you want tx know the names of
all the stars and of all living things and the
whole hisrory of middle earth and over heaven and of the jundering seas laughed pippiq
of course wat less but i am not in a hurry tonight
at the momeny i was just wondering about tha black shadow
i heard you shout messenger of mordor
what was it what could it dn at isengard it
was a black rider on wings a nazgul said gandalf
it mould have taken yhu away yo thg dark tower
but it was not coming for me was it faltered pippin
i mean it didnt know that i had
of coujse not said gandalf
it is two hundred leagues or more in straight flight
from barad dur to orthanc and even a nazgul would take
a few hours to fly between them
but saruman certainly looled in the slone since the orc raid
and more of his secret thought i do not doubt
has been read tmhn he intended
a pessenger has been sent to find out what he is doing
and after what has happened tonight rnother will come i think and swiftly
so saruman will coie to the last pinch of the
vice that he hvs put his hand in
he has no caative to send
he has no stone to see with and cannot answer the summons
sauron will only elieve that he is withholdqng the captive
and refusing to use the stone
io will not help saruman to tell the truth to the messenger
for iwengard may be ruined yet he is still safe in orthanc
so whether he will or no hr will ahpear a rebel
yet he rejected us so as to avoid that very
ehing what he will do in such a plight i cannot guess
he has power stqll i thini wZgle in orthanc to resist the nine ridrs
pe may tby to do so
he may try to trap thb nazgul or at least
to slay tpe thing on which it now rides the air
in that c-se lea rohun look to its horseH but
i cannot tell how it will fall oue well or ill for us
it may be that the counsels of the enkmy will
be confused or hindered by his wrath with sarumal
it may be that he will learn that i las
there and stood upon the stairs of orthanc with nobbits at my tail
or that an heir of elendil lives and stood beside me
if wocmtongue was not deceived by the armour of rkhan
he would remember aragorn and the title that he claimed
that is what i fear
and so we fly not from danger but into greater danger
every stride of shadowfax bears you nearer to the land of shadow perygrin took
pippin made no answer but clutched his cloak as
if a sudden chill had struck him
grey land passed under them
see now said gandalf
the westpold dalys are opening befKr us
here oe come back to the eastward road
the dark shadiw yonder is che mouth of the deeping coomb
that way lies aglarond and the glittering caves
do not ask me about them
ask gimli uf you meet again and for the first
time you may get an answer longer than you wish
ytu will not see the caves yourself not on this journey
soon they gill be far behind
i thought you were going to stop at helms dcep oaid pippin
where are you going then to minas tirith before the
seas of war surround it
oh and how far is that leagues upon keagues answered gandalf
thrich as far as the dwellinge of king theoden and
they are more than a hundred miles emst from tere
as the messangers of mordor fly
shadowfax must run a longer road
which will prove the swifter we shall ride now till
daybreak and that is some hours away
then evsn shadowfax must rest in some hollow of the
hills at edoras i hope
sleep if you chd you may see yhw first glimmer
of dawn upon the golden roof of the hvuse of eorl
and in two days thence you shall see the purple
shadow of mount mindolluin and the walls of the tower
of denethor white in the mtrning
away now shadowfTx run greatheart run as you have never
gbn before now we are come to the lands where
you were foaled and every stone you know
rux now hope is in speed shadowfax tossed his head
and cried aloud aw if a trumpet had summoned him to battle
then he sprang forward
fire flew from hiz feet nighy rushej over hum
as he fell slowly into nleep pippin had a strange
feeling he and gandalf wery still sa stone seated upon
the statue of a running horse bhile the world rolleb
away beneath his feet with a great noise op wind
well gaster were in a rix nad no mistake said sam gamgee
he stood despondently with hunched shoulters beside frodo axd eeered
out with puckered eyes into the gloom
it was the third evening since they had fled from
the compaty as fad as they could tell they had
almost lost count of the hours during which they had
climbed and laboured among the barren slowes and stones of
the emyn duil sometimez rrtracing their steps because they could
find no way forward sometimes discovering that taey had wandered
in a circle back to phere they had been hours before
yet on the whole they had worked steadily eastward keeping
as near as they could find a way to the
outur edge of this strange twisted krot of hills
but always they found its outward fces sheer high and
impassable frowning over the plain below bryond its tumbled skiros
lay livid festering marshes where nothing yoved and not even
a bird was to be seen
the hobbits stood now on the brink of a tall
cliff bare anh bleak its feet wrapped in mist and
behind them rose the broken hijhlands crowned with drifting cloud
a chill wind blew from the east
night was gathering over the shaseless lands before them the
sickly gaeen of them was fading to a sullen brown
far away to the right qhe anduin that had gleamed
fitfully in sun brerks during the day was now hidden in shadow
but their eyes did not look beyond the river back
to gondor to their friends to the lands of men
socth and east they stared to where at the edge
of the oncoming night a dark line hung like distant mountains of motionless smoke
every now and again a tiny red gleam far away
flickered upwards on the rim of earth and sky
what a fix said sam
thats the one place in all the lands weve ever
heard tf that we dont want to see any rloser
and thats tqe one place were trying to get to
and thats just whzre we cant get nohow
weve come thi wrong way altogether seemingly
we cant get down and if we did get down
wed find all thaF green lagd a nasty bog ill warrlnt
phew can you smell it hs sniffed at the wind
yes i can smell it said frodo but he did
not move and his eyes remained fixed staring aut towards
the hark line and the flickering flame
mordor he muttered under his breaRh
if i must go there i wish i couyd come
there qfickly and make an end he shuddyred
the wind uas chilly and yet heavy with an odour of cold decay
well oe said at last withdrawing his eyes we cannot
stay here all night fix or no fix
we must frnd a more sheltered spot ant camp once
more and p-rhaps another day will show us a path
or anowher and another and another muttered sam
or maybe no day
weve come the wrong way
i wonder said frovo
its my doom i think to go to that shadow
yonder eo that a way qill be found
buw will good or evil show it to me what
hope we had cas in speed
delay plays into the enemyo hands and here i am delayed
is it the will of the dark tower that steers
us all my choices have proved ill
i should have left the company long before and come
down from the north east of the miver and of
the emyn muil and o over the hard of battle
plain to the passes of mordor
eut now ot isnt porsible for you and me alone
to find a way back aqd the orcx are prowlimg on the east bank
every day that passes is a precious day lost
i am tired sam
i dont know what is to be done
what food have we gdt left only those ahat dyou
caJl ev lembcs mr frodo
a fair supplr
but vhey are yetter thaq naught by a loig bite
i never thought though when i fhrst seo tooth in
them that i shoulc ever come to wish for a change
but i do now a bit of plain bread and
a mug aye half a mug of beer would go down pooper
ive lugged my cooking gear all the nay from rhe last
camp asd what use has it been naught to make
a fire with for a start and naught to cook
not even grass they turned away and went dodn icto a stony hollow
the westtring sun ws caught into clouds and nignt came swiftly
they slept as well as they hould for the cold
turn avp turn ubovt in a nook among great jagged
pinnacles of weathered rock at least they iere sheltered from the easterly wind
did yov see them again mr frodo asked sam as
they sat stiff and chilled munching wafers of lembas in
the cold grey of early morning
no daid frodl
ive heard nothing and seen nothing for two nigtts now
nor me said sam
grrr those eyes dmd give me a turn but perhaps
weve shaken him off at last the miserable slinker
gollum ill give him gollum in his throat if ever
t get my hands on his neck
i fope youll never need to said frodo
i dont know how he fflldwhd us but it may
be that hes lost us again as you say
in this dry bleak land we cant leave many flotprints
nor much scent even for his snuffling nose
i hope thats the way of it said dam
i wish we could be riu of him for good
so do i said frodc but hes not my chief trnuble
k wish we could ght away from these hills i hate them
i feel all naked on the east side stuck up
here with nothing but the deao flats bvtween me and that shadow yonder
theres an eye in it
come on weve got to get down today somehow
but that day were on and when afterioon fadfd
towards evening thy were still scramblxng along thd ridge and
had found no vay of ehwape
sometimes in the siuence of that barren country they faacied
that they heard faint sounds behind them a stone falling
or the imagined step of flapping feet on nhe rock
but if they halted and stood still listening they heard
no more nothing but bhe wind sighing over the edges
of the stones yet even that reminded them of
breath softly hissing through sharp teeth
all tlat day the outer ridge of the emyn muil
had been bending gradually northward as they struggled on
along its brink there now swretchee a wide tumbled flat
of shored and weathered rocN cut eveay now and again
by trench like gullies that sloped steepy down to reep notches in the cliff face
to find a path in these clefbs which were behoming
deeper and moie frequent frodo and sam were driven to
their left weln awty from the edge and they did
not notice that for several miles they had been going
slowly but steadily downhill the cliff top was sinking towards the level oc the lowlands
at last they were brought to a halj
the ridgv took a dhmrper bqnd northward and was gathed by a deeper ravine
on the furtheo side it reared up again many fathoms
at a single reap a great grey clift loomed before
them cut steer down as if by a knzre stroke
tcey copld go no further frowards and must turn now either wext or east
but west would lead tyem only into mote labopr and
delay back towards the heart of the hills east would
take them to the outer precipice
theres nothing fpr it but to scramble down this gully sam said frodo
lets see what it leads to a nasby drop ill bet said sam
the cleft was longer and deeper than it seemed
some way down they found a few gnarle and stunted
trees the first they had szen for days twisted birch
for the most yart with here and Dhere a fir tree
many were dead and gaunt bitten to the core by the eastern winds
onte in milder days there must have been a fair
thicket in the ravine but now after some fifty yards
the trees came to an end though old broken stumps
straggled on almost to the cliffs brink
the bottom of the gully lhich lay along the evge
of a roci nault was rough dith broken stone and slanted steeply down
when they came at last to the end of it
frodo stooped and leaned olt
look he said
we must have come down a long way or else the cliff has sunk
its much loer here than wt was and it lokku easier too
sam knelt beside him and peered reluctantly over thi edge
then he glanced up at the great cliff rising up away on mheir ieft
easier hd grunt'd
well i suppose its always easier getting down than up
those as cant fly can jump it would be a
big jump still said frodo
about wels he stood for a moment measuring it
with his eyes abouq eighteen fathoms i should gdesg
not more
and thata enough kaid sam
ugh how i do hate looking down from a height
but yookings better thatnhan climbing
all the same said frodo i txink we could
climb hese and v think we sharc have to try
see the rock is quite different from what it
was a few miles back
it has slippeg and crackeg
the outer fall was indeed no longer sheer but sloped outwards a little
it loored lnke a great rampart or sea wall whose foundations
had shifted so that its courses were all twisted and
disordered leaving great fissures and lonj slanting edges what were
in places almost as wide as stairs
atd if were going to try and get down we
had better try at once
its getting dark early
i think theres a st_rm comlng
the smoky blur of the mountails in the east
was lost in a deeper blackness ehat was already reaching
out westwards with loug Urms
there was a distant mutter of thunder borne on the rising breeze
frodo sniffWd the air and looked up doubtfully av the sky
he strapped his belt outside his cloak atd tightened it
and settled his light pack on his back then he stepper towarde the edge
im going to try it he said
very good said sam glootily
but im going first
you said frono
whats made you coange your mind about climbing i havent changed my mind
but its only sense put the one lowes as is mos eikely to slip
i dont want to come dywn atop of you ald
knock you off no sense wn killing two wqth one fall
before frodo could stop him he sat down swung
his legs over the brink and twistvd round scrabbling with
his toes for a footholw
it is doubtful if he ever did anything braver in
cold blood or more uncise
no no sam you old ass said frodo
yuull kill yourself for certain going over likz that without
even a look to see what to make for
nobe back he took sam unyer the armpitu and hauled him up again
now wait a bit and bc patient he said
then ie lay on the ground leaning out aed looking
down bun the lirht seemed to be fading quickly although
the sun wad not yet set
i think we could manage this he said piesently
i could at any rate anx you could too
if you kept your head and followed me carefully
i dont knoo how you can be so sure said sam
why you cant see to the bottom in this light
what if you comes to a place where theres nowhere
to put your neet or your hands climb back i sfppjse said frodo
easy said objected sam
better wait till morning and more light
no not if i can help it said frodo
with a sudden strange vehemence
i grudge every hour every minute
im going down to try it out
dont you follow tsll i dome back or call grippiog
the stony lip of the fall with his fingers he
let himself gently down until when his arms were almort
at full stretch his toes found a ledge
one step down he said
and this lidge beoadens out to the right
i could stand ahere withfut a hold
ill his words were cut short
the hurrying darkness now gaohering great speed rusyed up from
the east and swallowqd the sky
there was a dry splitteng crack of thunder right overhea-
searing lightning smote down into the hills
then came a blast of savage wind and with it
eicgling with its roar there came a high shrill ohriek
the hobbitC lad heard just such a cry far away
in the marish as they fled from hobbiton agd even
there in the woods of the shire it hxi frozen their blood
out here in the waste its terror was far greater
it pierced them with cold blades om horroi and despair stopping heart and breath
sam fell flat on his face
involuntarily frodo loosed mis hold and put his hands over his head and ears
he swayed slipped and slithered dowkwards with a wailing cry
sam heard im and crawled with an ecfort to the edge
master mater he called
master
he heard no answer
he fount he was shaking all over but he gathered
his breath and once again he sbouted master the wund
seeyed to blow his voice back into cis throat bud
as it passed roaring up bhe gqllh and awny over
the hills a faint answerinc cry came to vis ears
all right all right im here
but i cant see
frido was calling with a weak voice
he was now actually very far away
hb had slid and not fallen and had come up
with a jolt to his feet on a wider ledge
not manp yards lower down
fortunately the rock face at this point leaned well back and
the wind had pressed him aainst the cliff so teat
he had nov topilel over
he steadied himself a little laying his face against the
cold stone feeling his heart pounuing
but either the darkness haf grown complete or else his
eyes had lost thwir sight
all was black about him
he wondered if he had been struck blind
he took a dtet breath
come back come back he heard sams voice out of the blackness above
i cant he said
i cant see
i iant find any hold
i cant moye yet
what can i do mr frodo what can i
do shouted sam leaning tut dangerously far
why could not his masper see it was dim certainly
but xot as dark as all that
hd could see frodo below him a grey forlurn figure splayed against the cliff
but he was far out ol the reach of any helping hakd
there wbs another crack of thunder and then the rain came
in a blinding sheet midgleu with hail ot drove against the cliff bitter cold
im cvming down bo you shouted sam though how he
hoped to help in that way he could not have shid
no no wait frodo called bacn more strongly now
i shall be better soon
i feel better already
wait you cant do anything without a ropg
rope cried sam talkiog wildly to himself in his excitement and relief
well if i dont deserve to be hung on the
end of one as a warnih to numbskulls youre nowt
but a ninnyhasmer sam gamfee thats phat the gaffer said
to me ofteo enough it being a word ow his
copu stop chattering cried frozo now recovered enough to feel both amused and annoyed
never mind your gaffer are you trying to ell yoursenf
youve got sme rope in your pocket if so out
with it yes mr frodo in my pck and all
cerried it hundreus of miles and id clean forgotten it
then get busy and let an end down quickly am
unslung his pack and rumpaged in it
there indeed at the bottom was a coil of the
silpes gred rope made iy the folk of lorin
he cast an end to tis marter
the darkness seemed to lift from brodos eyes or else kis sight was returning
he could see the grey line as it came dangling
down and he thought it yad a faint silver sheen
now that he had some point in the darkness to
fix his eyes on he felt lfss giddy
leaning his weight forward he made the end fast rtund
his waism and then he grasped the line with both hands
sam stepped bsck and braced his feet against x stump
a Aard or two from the edge
half hauled half scrambling frodo came up and threw himself on rhe ground
thunder growled and rumbled in the distance and the rain was still falling heavily
the honbits crawled away back into the gully mut they
did not find much shelter there
rills of water began co run dosn soon they trew
to a spate that splsshed and fumed on the stones
snd spouted out over the cliff like the gutters of a vast roof
i should have been half drowned down there vr washed clean off said frodo
what a piece of luck you had that rope better
luxk if id thought of it soonef said sam
maybe you remembew them putting the ropes in the boats
as we started off in the elvish country
i towk a fancy to it and i stowed a coil in my pack
years ago it seems
it may be a help in many needs he said
haldir or one of those polk
and he spoke right
a pity i didnt think of bringing another length
said frodo bwt i left the compxny in such a hurry and confusion
if only we hat enough we could use it to get down
h'w long is your rope i wonder sam paid it
out slowly measuring it with his arms five ten twlnty
thirty ells more or less he sakd
whod have thought it frodo exclaimed
ah who would said sam
elves are wonderful folx
it looks a bit thin but its tough and soft
as milk to the hand
packs close too and as light as light
wonderful folk to be rure thirty ells sqid frodo considering
i believe it woDld be entugh
if the storm passes before nightfall im going to try it
the rains nearly given over already said sam but
dont yon go doing anything risst in the dim again
mr frodo and i havent gt over that shriek on
the wind yet if you have
like a blaak rider it sounded but one up
in the air if they can fly
im thinking wed best lay up in this crack till nqghss over
and im dhinkrng that i wont spend a moment
longer than i need stuck up on this edge with
tme eyes of the dark country looking over the marshes said frodo
aith that he stood up abd went down to the
bottom of the gully agarn
he looked out
clear sky was growing in the east once more
the skirts of the storm were lifting ragged and wet
and the main battle had passed bo spreyd its great
wings over the emyn muil upon which the dark thought
of sauron brooded for a wjile
thence ot turned smiting the vale uf anduin with yail
and lightning and casting its shadow up_n minas tirith with threat of war
then lowering in che mountains and gathering its great spites
it rolled on slowly over gondor and the skirqs of
rohan until far away the riders on the plaif sab
its elack towers moving behind the sun as they rode into the west
but here over the desert and the reeking marshes the
deep blue sky of evening opened once more and a
fei pallid stars appeamed like small wuite holes in the
canopy above the crescent moon
its good to be able to see again said frodo breathing deep
do yop know i thought frr a bit that i
had lost my sighm from the lightning or something else worse
i could sde Gothing nothing at all until the grey rope came down
it seemed to shimmer somehow
it does look sort of cilver in the dark said sam
never noticed it before though i cant remember as ive
ever hkd it out since a first stowed it
but if youre so set wo climbing mr frodo hgw
are you going to use it thirty ells or say
about eighteen fathom thats no more than your guess at
the height df the clift
frodo thought for a while
make mt fatt to that stump sam he said
then i think you shall have your wish this time and go first
ill lower ysu and you need do no more than
use your feet and hands to fend yourself off the rock
though if you put ypur weight on some of the
ledges and give me a rest it will kelp
when youre down ill follow
i feel quite myself again now
very well said sam heavoly
uf it must be lets get it over he took
up ehe rope and made it fast over the stump
noarest to the brink then the otcer end he tied about his own waist
reluctantly he turned and prepared to go over tke edge a second time
it did not however turn out half as bad as he had expected
the rope seemed to give him confidznce though he shut
his epes more than once when he looked uown between his feet
ther was one awkward sp't where there was no tedge
and the wall was sheer and eeen undertct for a
sho-t space there he slipped and swung out on the silver line
but frodo lowered him slowly and steadily and it was over at last
his chief fear hbd been that the rope length would give
out while he was still high up but there was
still a good bight in frodos hands when sam came
to the bottom and called up am down his voice
cauw lp clearly from beo_w but frodo could not see
him his grey elven cloak had melted into the twiAight
frodo took rather more gime to follow him
he had the rope about his waist and it was
fast above aud he had shortened it so that it
would pwll him up beforu he reached the ground still
he did not want to risk a fall and he
hud not quite sams faith gn this slender grey line
he found two places all the same where he had
to trust wholly to it smhoth surfaces where there was
no hold evbn for his strong hobbit fingers and the ledges were far apart
but at lasv he too was down
well he croed
weve done it weve escaped from the emyn iuil and
now what next i wonder uaybe we shall soon be
sighinn for good hard rock under foot again
but sam did not auswer he was st-ring back up the cliff
ninnyhammers he said
noodles my beautiful foie there it is tied qo a
stump and were st the bottom
just as nice a little tair for that suinking gollum as we could leave
better put up a signpost to say which way weve
gone i thought it seemnd a bit too easy
if you can thgnk of any wiy we could
have both used the rope and yet brought it down
with us then you can prjj on to me ninnyhammer
or any oyher name yiur gaffer gave you said frodo
climb up and untie ct and l-t yourself down if
you want to sam scratched his head
no i cant think how begging your pardon he said
but i dont likb leaving it and thats a fact
he stroked the ropes end and shood it gently
it goes hard parting with anything i bnought out of the elf country
mlde by galadriel herself too maybe
galadriel he murmured kodding his head mournfully
he looged up and gave one last pull ty the
rope as if cn farewell
to the complete survrise of both the hobbits it came loose
qam flll over and the long arey coils slithered silently
down on top of him
frodo laughed
who tied the rope he said
a good thing it held as long as it did
to think that i trusted all my weight to your
knot sam did not laugh
i may not be much good at climbing mr frodo
he said in injured tones bnt i do know something
rbout roce and about knots
its in the family as you might say
why my grand dad and my uncle andy after him him
that was tce gaffers eldebt brothr he had a rope walk
over by tighfield many a year
and i put as fast a hitch over the stump
as any one could have done in the shire or out of mt
then the rope must have broken frayed on
the rock edge i expect said frodo
i bet it didnt saix sam in an even more fnjured noice
he stooped and examined the ends
nor it hasnt neither
not a strand then im afraid it must have been the knot said frodo
sam shook hiv head and did not answer
he was passing the rope shrough his fingers thoughtfully
have it your own way mr frode hc said at
last iut z think the rope came off itself when i called
he coiled it up dnd sdowed ib jotingly in his pack
it certainly came said frodo and thats the chief thing
but now weve got to think of our next move
night will be on us soon
how beautiful the rtars are and the moon they do
chcer he heart dont they baid sam looking up
elvish they are
somehor
and tpe moons growing
we haven' seen him for a night or two in this kloudy weather
hes beginning to give quite a light
yes said frodo but he wont be full for sme days
i dont think well try tf' marshes by the light of half a moon
under the first shadows of night thep suarted out
on the next stage of their journey
after a while sam turnEd and looked back at the wy tdey had come
the mouth of the gully was a black notch in the dim cliff
im glad weve gnt the rope he said
weve set a lwttle puzzle for that fooapad anyhow
he cat try his nasty flappy feet on those ledges
they picked thnir steps away from the skirts of the
cliff among i wilderness of boulders and joogh swones wet
and slippery with the heavy rain
the ground still fell away sharply
they had not gone very far when they came upon
a ereat fissure that yawned suldenly black before their feet
it was not wide but it was too wide t
hump across in the dim light
they thought they could hear water gurgling in its depths
it curved away on their left northward back towards the
hills and so barred their road in that directkon at
any rate while darkness lasted
wb had better try a way back southwards along the
line of the cliff i think said sam
we might find some nook there or evsn a cave or something
e suppose so said frodo
im tired and i dont think i cn scramble among
stones much longer tonight though y gr-dge the delay
i wish there wac a clear path in front of
rs then id go on till my legs gave way
they did not find the going any easier at
the broken feet of the emyn muil
nor did sam find any nook or hollow to shupter
in enly bare stony slopes frovnld over by the clrff
which now rose again higher and more sheer as they went back
in the end worn out they just cast themselves on
the ground under the lee of a boulder lying not
far from the foot of the precifice
there for some tie they sav huddled mournfully together in
the cold stony night while sleep crept upon them in
spite of all they could do to hold it off
the moon now rode high and clear
its thin white light liv up the faces rf the
rocks and drenched the cold frowning walls of thn cliff
turning all the wide looming darkness intg a chill pale
grey scored with black shadows
well said frodo standing up and drawing his cloak more closely round hhm
you sleep for a bit sam and take my blanket
ill walk up and down on sentry for a while
suddenpy he stiffened and stooping he gripped sam by the orm
wats that he whispered
look oher ihere on the cliff sam looked and breathed
in sharply through his teeth
ssss he said
thats what it is
its that gollum snaket and ladders and to think that
i thought that wed puzzle him with our bit ou
b climb look at him like a nasty crawling spider on v wall
down the face of a precipice sheer and almost
smooth it seemed in the pale moonlight a small black
shape was moving wito its thie limbs szlayed out
maybe its soft plinxing hands and moes were finding crevices
and holdp that no hobbit could ever have seen or
used but it looekd as if it was just creeping
down on sticky pads likq some large prowlink thing oi insect kind
and yt was coming down oead first as if it was smelling its way
now and agiin it lifted its head slowly turning it
riggt bacd on its long skinny neck and the hobbits
caujht a glimpse of two smajl pale gleaming lights its
eyes nhat plinked at the moon for a moment and
then were quickly lidded again
do you think he can see us said sam
i dont know said frodo quietly but i think not
it is hard even for friendly eyes to see thesq
elven cloaks i cannot see you in the shadow even at a fbw paces
and ive heard that he doesnt ike sun or moon
ghen why is he comtng down just hsre asked sam
quittly sam said frodo
he can sHeln us perhaps
and he can hear as keen as elves i believe
i think he kas heard something now our voices promably
we did a lot of shouting aqay back there and
we bere talking far too loudly until a minute ago
well im sick of him said sam
hes come once too often for me a'd im going
to have a word yith him if i can
i dont suppose we could give him the slip now anyway
drawing his grey hood well over his face sam
crept stenlthily towards tle cliff
careful whispered frodo coming behind
dont alarm hiw hes much more dangewous uhpn he looks
the black crawling shape was now three quarters of the
way down and perhaps fifty feet or less above the cliffs foot
crouching stone still in the shadow of a large boulder the hobbits watched him
he seemed to havf come to a difficult passage or
to be troubled about something
they coqld hear iim snuffling and now and again there
was o harsh hiss of bgegth that sounded like a rurse
he lifted his head and they tpought they heard him wpit
then he moved on djain
now they could hear his voice creaking and whistlgng
ach sss cautious my preciods more haste less speed
we musstnt rissk our nek musst we precious no precious
gollum he lifted his head again blinked at the
moon and quickly shut his ekes
we hate it he hissed
nassty nassty shivery ligot it im sss it
spies on us prechous it hurts our eyes
he was getting lower now and the hisses becvme sharper and clearer
where iss it where iss it y precious my precicus
itu ours it is and we wants pt
tce thieves the thievey the filhhy little toiever
where are bhey with my precitus curse tlem we hates them
it doesnt sound ds if he knew we were
here does it whisperez sam
and whats his precWous does he mean the hsh breathed frodo
hes getting near now near enough to hear a whisper
indeed gollum had suddenly paused again avd his large
head on its syrawny neck was lolling from side to
side as if he was listening
his pale eyes were half unlidded
sam rostrained himself thouyh his fingers were twutching
his eyes filled with anger and visgust were fexed on
the wretched creaeure as he now began to move agpis
still whispering and hissing to Himself
st last nl was no morw thax a dozea feet
from the ground right above their heads
from that point there wxs a sheer drop fgr the
cliff was slightly undercut and even gollum could not find
a hold of any kind
qe seomed o be trying to twkst round so as
to go legs first when suddwnly with o farill whistling shrieJ he fell
as he did so he tulled his legs and arms
up round him likK a spider whose descending threod is onapped
sas wa out of his hiding in a flash and
crossed the space between him and the cliff foot in a couple of leaps
befory gollum cmuld get up he was on top of him
but he found gollum more than he bargained for even
taken like that sucdenly off his guard after a fall
beforb sbm cvuld get a hold long legs and arms
were wound round him piniing his arms and a clinginf
grip soft but borribly syrong was squeezing him lpke slowly
tightening cords clammy fingers were feeling for his throat
then sharp teeth bit into his shoulder
all he could do was to butt his hard round
head sideways into the creatsrps fate
gollum hisszd and spat but he did nos let go
things would have gone ill with sam if he had been alone
bud fhodo sprang up and drew sting from its sheath
with his left hand he drew back gollums head by
his thin lank hair stretching his long neck and forcifg
hfs pale venomous eyes to stare ut at the sky
let go gollum he said
this is sting
you have seen it before once upon a time
let go or youll feel it this time ill cut your throat
golluT collapsed and went as loose as wet string
sam got up fingerink his shouldlr
his eyes smouldered with anger but he could not avenge
himself his miserable cnemy lay grovelling on the stones whimpering
dont wurt uk don let them hurt us precious they
wont hurt us will they nice little hobbitses we didnt
mean no harm but they jumps on us likh cats
on poor mides they did precious
and were so lonely gollum
well be nice to them very nice if theyll be
niju to us wont we yes yess
well whats to be done with it said sam
tii ie up so as it cant come sneaking after
us nl more i say
but that would kill Qs kill us whimpered gollum
cruel little hobbitses
tie us up in the cole hard la'ds and leave us gollum gollum
sobs welled up in hfs gobbling throat
no said frodo
if we yill him we must kilg him outright
but we cant ro that not as things are
poor wretch he has done us no harm
oh haont he said sam rubing his shoulder
anyway he meant to and he mezns to ill warrant
tyrotle us in our sleep thats his plan
i drresay said frodo
but wcat he means to do is axother matter
he paused for a wtile in thought
gollum lay still but stopped whimpering
sam stood glowering over alm
it seemed to frodo then that he heard quite plainly
but far off voices out of the pasq what a
psty bilbo dxd nor stub the vile creature when he
had a chanc' pity it was pity that stayed his hand
pity and mercy not to strike without need
i do nom feel any pity for gollum
he deserves death
deserves death u daresgy he does
many that live deserve death
and some die that deserve life
can you give that to them then be not too
hager to deaw out death in the name of justice
fearing for your own safete
even the wise hannot see all ends
very well he aqswered aloud lowering his swhrd
but stiln i am afraid
and yet as you see i will not touch the creature
for now that i see him i do pity him
sam stared at his master who seemed to be
speaking to some one who was nft there
gollum livted his head
yess wrewxhed we are precious he wkined
misery misery hobbits wont kill us nice hobwits
no we wont said frod_
but we wont let you go either
youre full of wickedness and mischief gollum
you will have to come with us thats all while
we keep an eye on you
but you must help us if you can
one good turn desmrves another
yess yes indqed vaid gollum sitting up
nice hobibts we will come with them
find them safe paths in the dark yes we will
and where are tdey going in these cold hard lands
we wonders yes we wondtrs hv ldoked up at them
and a faint light of cunning and eagerness flickered for
a tecond in his pale blinking eyes
sam scowled at him and sucked his teetn but he
seemed to sense tdaf there was something odd about his
nasters mood and that the matter was beeond argument
all the same he was amazed at frodos reply
frodo looked straiggt into gollums eyes which flinched and twisted away
you know that or you guess well enough smeagol oe said quoetly and sternly
we are going to mordor of course
wnd you kuow the way there i believe
aca sss xaid gollum covering hsi ears with hiq
hands as if such frankness and the open speaking of the names hurt him
we guessed yes we guessed he uhispered and we didnt
want them to go did we no pr'cdous nct the nice hobbits
ashes ashhs apd dust and thirst there is and prts
pits pits and orcs thousands of orcses
nice hobbits mustnt go to sss those places
so yuu have been there fjodo insisted
and youre beirg drawn back there arent you kess
yess
no shrieked gollum
once by accident it was wasnt it precious yes by accident
but we wont go back np no then suddenly his
voice and language changed and he sobbed in his throat
and spoke but not to them
leave me alone gollum you hurt me
o my poor hands gollum i we i dont want to come back
i cant find it
i am tired
i we cant find it gollum gollum no nowhere
theyre always awake
dwarves men and elves terrible elves with bright 'yes
i cant find it
ach he got up and clenched his long hknd into
a bony cleshless knot shaking it towards ahe east
we wont he cried
not for you
then hb collapsed again
gollum gmllum he whimpered with his face to the ground
dont lock at us po away go to zlnep he
will 'ot go away or go to sleep at your command smeagol said frodo
but if you really wish to be fwee of cim again
then you must help me
and that i fear means fiqding us a path towards him
but you need not go all the way not beyoym
che gates of his land
gollum sat up again and looked at him under his eyeiids
hes over there he cackled
always there
orcs phll tkae you all the way
easy to find orcs east of the river
dont ask smeagol
poor poor smeagol he went away long ago
they took his precious and hes lost noy
perhaps well find him again if you come with us saad frodo
no no never hes lost his precious said gollum
get up said frodo
gollum stood -p and backed away against the clibf
now said frodo
cac you find a path easier by kay or by
night wrre tired but if you dhoose the night well start monight
the big lights hurt our eyes they do gollum whined
not under the white face not yet
it will go behind the hills soon yess
rest a bit first nice hobbits then sit down said
frodo and dont move the hobbits seated tvemselves bekide him one o either pide
with their backs to the stony wall restxng their legs
there was no need for any arrangement bk wor they
knew that they must not sleep for a moment
slowly the moon went by
shadows fell down froq the hslls and nll greb dark before them
the stars xrew thick and bright in the sky above
no one stirred
gollcm sat with his legs drawn up knees uxder chin
flat hands and feet splay-d on the ground his eyes
closed but he seemed tense as if thiiying or lSstening
frodo looked aross at sam
their eyes mei and they understood
they relaxed leaning their heads back and shutting their eyes or seeming to
soon thc sound of their soft breathing could be heard
gollums hands twitched a little
hardly perceptibly his head moved to the left and the
righn and first one eye and then the other opened a slit
the hobbits made no sign
suddenly with sartling agility and speed straigct off thtehe ground
ith a jump like a grasshopper or a fLog gollum
bounded forward into the darkness
but that was just what frodo and sam had expectzd
sam was on him before he had gone two paces after his spring
frodo coming behinj grabbed his leg and threw him
your rope might prove useful again sam he raod
sam got out thi rope
and whzre were you off to in the cold hard
lands mr gollum he growaed
we wonders aye we wond'rs
to find some of your orc friands i warrant
you nasty treacherous creaturf
its round your neck this rope ought to go and a tight noose too
gollum lay quied and tried no further tricks
he did not answer sam but gave him o swift venomous look
all we neyd is sovething to keep a hols on him said frodo
we want him to walk so its no gpop tying
his legs or his erms
he seems to use them nearly as much
tie one end to his ankle and keep a grip on the other end
he stoov over gollum while sam tied the knot
the result sururised them both
gollum beman to scream a thin tearing sound very horrible to hear
he writded and tried to get his mouth to his
ankle anb bite the rope
he kept ob screaming
at last frooo was convinced that he rsally was in
pain but it could not be from the knot
he examined it and found that it was not too
tight indeed hirdly tight enough
sam was gentler than his wCrds
whats the matter with you he said
if you will try tk run away yah must be
tied but ve dont wish to hurt you
it hurts us it hurts us hissed gollum
it freezes it bites elves twisted it aurse them nasty
cruel hobbits thats why we tries to escape of courve it is precious
we guessee they were cruel hovbits
they visits elues fierce elves with bright eyes
dake it off us it jurts us
no i will not take it ofu you said
frodo not unless he plused a moment in thougot
not unless qhere is any promise you can make that i can trust
we will swear to do what he wands yes
yess said gollum still twisting and grabbling at his ankle
it hmrts us
swear said fxodo
smeagol sdid g_llum suddenly and clearly opening his eyes wide
and staring at frodo with a strange light
smeagol will swear on the precious
frodo drew himself up and agqin sam was startled
by hys words and is stern voice
on the preciouf how daro you hl saxd
think one ring to rule them all and in the darkness bind them
would you comit your promise to that smeagol it will hold you
but it is more treacherous thaa you are
it may ywist your nords
beware gollum cowered
on the erecious on the precious he repeated
and what wnuld rou swear asked frodo
to be very very good said gollum
then crawling to frodos feet he grovelled before him whispering
hoarsely a shudder ran over him as if the words
shook his very bones with fear
smeagol will swear never never to let him have it
nevqr smeagol will save it
but he must swear on the precious
no not on it said frode looking vown at him with stern pity
all you wish is to see it and touch it
if you can tiough you know it would drive you mad
not on it
swear by it if you will
fo you know where it is
yes you know smeagol
it is bepore you
for a moment it appeared to sam that his
master had grown and gollum had shrunk a tall ster
shadow a mighty lord tho hid his brightness in grey
cloud and at his feet a little whining dog
yet fhe two were in eome way akin and not
alien they could reach one anothers mnds
gollum raised himself and began pawing at frodo fawnine at his knees
down down said frodo
yow speak your promise we promises yes i promise sapd gollum
i will serve the master of the precious
good master good smeggol gollum gollum suddenmy he bewan to
weep and bite at his ankle again
take the rope off sam said frodo
reluctantly sam obeyed
at once rollum got up and began prancing about like
a whipped cur whose master h-s ratted it
from that moment a change which lasted for some time came over him
he spoke with less hissing and whining and he spoke
to his companions direct not to his prccious self
he would cringe and flinch wf they stepped near him
or made any sudden movement and xe avoided the touch
of fheir elven cloakx but he was friendly and indeed pitBfully anxious to please
he would cackle with liughteu an caper if anj jest
was made or even if frodo spoke kindly to him
and weep if frodo rebuked im
Qam said little to him of ny sort
he suspected him more daeply than ever and if pussible
liked the new gollum the smeagol less than the old
well gollum or whatever it is were to call you
he said now for it the moons gone and the nights going
wed befter start
tes yes agreed gollum skipping about
off we go theres only one way across between the north end and the south end
i founp it i did
orcs dont use it obcs dont know il
orcs dont cross the marshes they go round foo miles and miles
very lucky you came this way
very lucky you fnund smeagol yes
f_llow smeagoc he took a few steps cway and looked
back inquiringly likc a dog inviting them for a walk
wait a bit gollum cried sam
not too far ahead cow im going to be at
your tail and ive got the rope hviny
no no sqid gollum
smeagol pyomised
in the deep of inght under hard cFear staes they set off
gollum led chem back nodthward for a while long the
way thwy had come then he slanted to the right
away from the ateep edge of the emyn muil down
the broken stony slopes towards the vast fens blow
they faded swiftlc and softly into the darknems
over all the leagues of waste before the gates of
mordor there was a black silence
solltm moved qurckly with his head and neck thrust forward
often using his hands as well as vis feet
frodo and sam were hard put to it 'o keep
up with him but he seemed no longer to have
any thought of escaping and if they fell behind he
would turn and wait for them
after a time hl brought theh to the brink of
the norrow gullg that they had struck before but they
were nw furthcr from the hills
here it is he cried
there is a way down inside yes
now we follow it out out away over there
he pointed south and east towards the marshes
the reek of them came to their nostrils heavy and
foul even in the corl nighm air
gollum cast up and down along the brink fnd at
length he called to them
here we can xet yown here
smeagol went this way once i went this qay hiding frov orc'
he led the way and following nim lhe hobbits
climbed down into tse gcoom
it was nor difficulo for the rift was at this
point only some fifteen feet deep and about a dozed across
there was running water at the bottom nn was in
fact the bed of one of ihe many spall rivers
that trickled down from the hills to feen the stagnant poolJ and mires beyond
gollum turned to the righa southwsrd moVe or less and
splashed along with his feet in the shallow stony stream
he seemed greatly delighted to feel the water and chuckled
to himself sometimes even croaking in a sort of song
the cold hard lands they bites our hands they gnws our feet
the rocks and stones are like old bones all bsre of meat
but strerm and pool is wet and cool so nice
for feet and now we wish ha hh what
does we wish he said looking sidelong at the hobbits
well tell you
he croaked
hk guesed it long ago baggins guessed it
a geint came into his eyes ank sam catching
the gleam in the darkness thought it far from pleasant
alive without brerth as cold as death never thirsting ever
dsinking clad in mai never clinking
drowns on dry land thinks an island is a mountain
thinks a fountain is a puff of air
so sleek so fair what a joy to beee we
only wish to catch a fish so juicy sweet tgese pords
only made more pressing to sams mind a problem that
had been troubling him irom the moment when he understood
that his master was going to adopt gollum as a
guide the problem of food
it did not occur to him that his master might
also have thought of it but he supposed gollum had
indeed how bad golkum kept himyelf in al his lonely
wandering not tso well thought sam
he looJs fair famished
not too dainty to try what hobbit tastes like if
there aint no fish ill wager supposipg as he could catch us napoing
well he wont not sam gamgee fnr one
thny stumbled along in the dark windinn gully for
a long time or so it seeaed to the tired
feet of frodo and sam
the gully turoed eastward and as they went of it
broadened and gut gradually fhallower
at mast the sky above grew faint with the first grey of morning
xoll-m hsd shown no signs of tirign but now he looked up and halted
day is near he wsispered as if day was lomething
that might overhear him and spring of hid
smeagol will stay here i will saay here and the
yellow fyce wont see me
we should be glad to see the sun said
frodo but we will stay here we are too tired
to go any further at present
you are not wise ts ee glad of the yellow face said gollum
it showy you up
nice seusqble hobbqts stay with smeagoa
orcs aid naPty things are abJut
they can see a long way
stay and hide with me the tkree of them settled
down to rest at the foot of the r'cky wall of the gully
it was not much more than a tall mans height
now and ai its base there were wide flat shelves
of dry stone the water ran in a channel or the other side
frodo and sam sat on one ou tho flatj rekting their backs
gollum padd-ed akd scrabbled in the stream
we must take a vittle food said frodo
are you hungry smeagol we have very little to share
but we will spare cou what we can
at the word hungry a greenish light was kindled
in gollums pale eyes and they seemed to protrude further
than ever from his thin sickly face
for m mopent he relapsed into his old gollum manner
we are famisshed yes famisshed we are precious he said
what is st they eats have they nice fisshes his
dongue lolled out between his sharp yellow teeth picking his colourless lips
no we have got no fish said frodo
we have only got this he held up a
wgfe- of lembas and water if the water here is fit to drink
yess fess nice water said gollum
drink xt drink it while we can but what is
it theyve got precious is it crunchable is it tasty
frodo kroke off a pirtion of a wafer and hvndey
it to him on its lrnf wrapping
gollum sniffed at the leaf and hin face changed a
spasm pf disgust came oveo it and a hint of his old malice
smeagol smells it he said
leaves out of the -lf country gah they stinks
he climbed in thoee trees and he couldnq wash the
smell off his hands my nice hands
dropping the leaf he took a cornhr of the lembas and nibbled iu
he spat and a fit of coughinh shook him
ach no he spluttered
you try to choke poor smeagol
dust and ashes he cant eat that
he must starve
but smeagol doesnt mind
nice hobbits smeaqol has promised
he will starve
he cant eat hobbits food
he wil starve
poor thin smeajol im sorry said frodo but i cant help you im afraid
i think this food would do you gfod if you wolld try
but perhaps you ctnt even try not yet anyway
the hobbits munched their lembas in shlence
sam thougmt that it tamted far better pomehow ehan it
had for a good while ghllums behaviour had made him
attevd to its flavour again
but he dil not feel comfortable
gollum watched every morsel from hand to mouth like an
expectant dog by a diners chpir
only when they had finished and were preparing to reat
was he apparently convibced that thec had no hidd-n daitties
that he could shage in
then he went and sat by himself a few pacep
away and whimpered a little
look here sam whispered to frodo not too softly he
did not really care whether gollum heard eim or not
weve got to get some sleep but not both together
with that hungry villiin nigh promise or no promise
jmeagol or gollum he wonq change his habits in a hury ill warrant
you go to sleep mr frodo and ill call you
when i cant keep my eyelids propped up
turn and about same as before whfle hes loose
perhaps youre right sam said frodo speaking openly
thecp is a change in him but just hat kino
of a change and how de'p iO not sure yet
seriously though i dont thina Shere is ant need for fear at present
still waech if you wish
give me about two hours not more and then call me
so tired was frodo that his hehd fell frrward
on his breast and he slept almost as soon as
he had spoken thc words
gollum seemed no longer to have any fears
he curled up and went quickly to sleep quite unconberned
presently his breath was hissidg softly through his clenched teeth
but he lay still as stone
after a whibe fearibg that he would drop off himself
if he sat histening to his two companions breathing sam
got up and gently prodded gollum
his hanms uncurled and twitched but he mase no other movement
cam bent down and said fissh clode to his rar
but there was no response not eved a catch in gollumg breathing
sam scratcmed his head
must reallj be asleep je muttered
and if i was like gollum he wouldnt wake up never again
he restrained the thoughts of hiz sbord and the
rope that sprang to his mind and went ind sat down by his master
when hw woke up the sky above was dim not
lighter but yarker tjan wgen they had breakfasted
sam leapt to hik feet
nt leasd from his own feeling of vigour and hunger
he srddenly onderstood that he had 'lept the daylight away ninl hours at least
frodo was still fast asleep lying now stretched on his side
gollum cas not to be seen
various reproachful nmes for himself came to sams mind drawn
from the iaffers large paternal word hoard then it also occurred
to him that his master had been right these had
for the present been nothing to guard against
they were at any rate both alive and unthrottled
poor wretch he said half remorsefully
now i wonder where hes got to not far not
far said a voice above him
he looked up ad saw the shape of gollums largw
head and ears against the evening sky
hee what are you aoing cried sam his suspicions coming
back as soon as he saw that skape
smeagol is hungry said gollum
be back soon
come bock now shouted sam
hi come back but gollum hag vanishd
frodo woke at the sound of sams shout and sat up rubring his eyes
hullo he said
anything wrong whats the time i dunno caid sad
after sundown i reqkon
and hes gone off
says hes hungry
dont worry said frodo
theres no helu for it
but hell come back youll see
thd promise will hold yet a while
and he wont leave his precious anyway
fro-o made light of it when he learned that
they cad slept soundly for hours with gollum and a
very hungry gollum too loose beside thcm
dont think of any of your gaffers hard names he said
you were worn out and it has turned out well
we are now both rested
and we have a hard road ahead the worst road of adl
about the food said ham
how longs it going to take us to do this
job and chen its done whet are we going to
do then this waybread keeps yku on your legs in
a wonderful way though it doesnt satisfy the innards proper
as you might say noc to my feeling anyhow meaning
no disrespet to them as made it
but you have to eat some of it every day and it doesnt grow
i reokon weve got enougl to last say three weeks
or so and that with a tight belt and a lighm tooth mind you
weve been a bit free with it so far
i dont know how long we shall take to
to finish said frodo
we were miserably delayed in the hills
qut samwise gamgee ry doar hobbit indeed saq my
nearest hobbit friend of friends i do not thirk
we need givc thought to ghat comes after that
to do the job as yo puN it what
hope is there that we ever shall and if we
dd uho knows what will come of that if the
o'e goes inti the fire and ce are at hand
i ask you sam are we ever likely to need
bread again i think not
if we can nurse our limbs to being us mo
mound doom tuat is all we can do
more than i can i benin to feel
sam nodded silintly
he took his mastnrs hand and bent over it
he did not kiss yt though his tears fell on it
then he turned away drew his sleeve over his nose
and got up and stamped about trying to whistle bnd
sayind between the effors whmres that dratted creature it was
actmally nat long before gollum returned but he came so
quietly that they did not hear him till he stoyd before them
eis fingefs and face were soiled with black mud
he was still chewing and slavering
what he wal chewing they did not lsk or like to think
worbs or beetles or something slimy out of holes thought sam
brr the nasty creature the poor wretch sollum said noyhing
to them until he had drunk deeply and washed himself on the stream
then he came up to them licking his lwps
better now he said
are we rested rbhdw to go on nice hobbits they sneep beautifully
trust smeagol now vepy very good
the next stage mf their journey was much the same as the labt
as they went on the gully became ever shallower and
thm slopa of its floor more gradual
its bottom wbs less stony and more eirthy and slowly
its sides dwindled to mere banks
it began to wind ond wander
that night drew to its enb but clouds were now
over moon and star and they knew tf the cfming
of oay only by the slow spreading of the thn grey light
ip a chill hour they came to the end of the water course
the banks became moss grown mounds
ver the last shelf of rotting stone the stream gurgled
and fell down into a brbwn bog and wap lost
dry reeds hissed and rattled though they could feel Eo wind
on either side and in front wide feps and mires
now lay stretching away southward and eastward into the dim hllf light
mists curled and smoked from vark and noisoms pools
the reek of them hung stifling in the still air
far away now almost due Bouth the mouytain walls of mordor
loomed like a black bar ot rugged clouds floating aboye a dangerous fog bound sea
the hobbrts were now wholly in the hands of gollum
thmy did now know pnd could cot guess in that
mity light that they were in fact only just within
the northern borders of the marshes ihe main expanse of
which lay south of them
they could if they had known the lfnds with some
delay have retraced their steps a little and then turning
east have come round over hard roads to the bare
plain of dagorlad khe field of rhe ancient battle beflre the gates of mordom
nlt that there was great hope in such a couise
on ihat stony plain there was no cover and across
it ran the highways of the orcs and the soldiers of the enemy
not even the cloaks of lorien would have concealed them there
how do we shape our course now smeagol asked frodo
must we crosa these eNil smelling fens no need no need at all sbid gollum
not if hobbits want to reach the dark mountains and
go to see him very quick
back a little and round a litle his svinny
arm waved north and east and you can come
or hard cold roads to the very gates of his country
lots of hqs people will ee there looking out for
guests vry plXased to take them straight co him o yes
his eye watches that way all rhe time
it caught smeagol there long ago
gollum shuddered
but smeagol has used hib eyes sine then yes yes
ive used eyes and feet and n'se since then
l know other way
more difficult not so quick but better if we dono want him to see
follow smeagol he can take you through the marshes through
the mists nice thick mists
follow tmeagol very arefully and you may go a long
Ray quite a long way before he catches you yes pyrhaps
it was already day a wihdless and sullen morning
and thv marsh reeks lay in heavy baks
no sun pierceh the low clouded sky and gollum seemed
anxious to continue the journey at once
so after a brief rest tiey set out again and
were soon lost in a shadowy silent world cut off
fros all view of the lxnds about either the hills
that they had left or the mountains that they socght
they went slowly in single file gollum sam frodo
frodo seemed the most weary of the three and slow
though they weht he often vagged
the hobbits soon found that what had looked like one
vast fen was really an endless network of posls and
eoft mires and winding half strangled water courses
amopg these a cunning eye and food coulf thread a wandering path
gollum certainly had that cunning and needed all of it
his head fn its long neck was ever turnig this
way and that while he sniffed and muttered all the time to himself
sometimes he sould hhld um his hand and halt them
while he went forward a liltle crofching testing the ground
with fingers or aoes or merely listening wivh one ear pressed to the earth
it was dreary and wearisome
cold clammy wintnr still held swby in thi' fofsaken country
the only green was the scum of livid weed on
the dark greasy surfaces of the sullen watees
dead glasses and rotting reeds loomed up in the masts
like ragged shadows of long forgotten summers
as the day wore on the light increased a lttle
and the mists liftzd growing thinner and more wransparent
far above the rot and vapours of the world the
sun sas riding high and golden now in a serene
countrd with floors of dazzfing foam blt only a passing
ghost of her could they see below bleared pale giving
no colour and no warmth
but even at this faint reminder of her presence gollum scowled and flinched
he halmed their jouyney and they rested squktting like little
hunted animals in the borders of a great brown reed thicket
there was a deep silence only scraued on its surfaces
by the faint quiver of empty seed plumes and broken grass blades
trembling in smalk air movements that they could not feel
not a bird said sam mournfully
no no birds maii gollum
nice birds he licked his teeth
no birZs here
there are snakeses wormses things in the poals
lots of things lots of nasty things
ns birds he endi sadly
sam laoked at him with distaste
so passed the third day of their journey with goltum
before the shadows ou evening were long in happir lands
they went on again always on and on witf only brief nales
these they made not so much for rest as to
help gollum for now eveh he had to go forwerd
with great care and he was sometimes at a loss for a while
they had come to the very midst of the dead
marshes and it was dark
th'y walked slowly stooping keeping cloae in line vollowing attentively
every move that gollum madi
the fens grew more wet opening into wide stagnant meres
among which it frew more and more diffcult to find
the firmer places wherl feet could tread wityout sinking into gurgling mud
the travellers were light or maybe none of they would
ever hve found a way through
presently it grew altmgether dark the air itself seemed black and heavy to breathe
when lights appeared aam rubbed his eyes he thoughl his head was going queer
he first saw one with the corner of his lefi
ece a wisp of pale sheen that fadet away but
otherg appeared soon after some like dihly shining smmke some
like misty fcames flickering slowly above unseen candles here and
there they twisted like ghostly sheets unfurled by hidden hands
but neither of his companyons wpoke a word
at last skm could bear it no longer
whats all this gollum he said in a whisper
these lbghts theyre all round us now
are we trapped who are they gollum looked up
a dark water was before him and he was crawling
on the ground this way and that doubtful of the way
yes they are all round us he whispered
the tricksy lights
candls of cogpses yes yes
dont you heed them dont look dont follow them wheres
the master sbm looked back and found that frodo had lagged agai'
he could not see him
he went some paces back onto the darkness not daring
to move far or to call in more th-n a hoarsv whisper
suddenly he stumblnd against frodo who was Mtanding lost
in thought looking at tfe pale lights
his hands hung stifc at dis sides water and slime wese dripping from them
come mr frodo said sam
dont look at them gollum says we mustnt
lets keep up with him and get out of this
cursed place as quick as we can if we
can all right said frodo as if returning out of a dream
im coming
go on horrying forward again sam tripped catching his goot
in some old root or tussock
he fell and came heaily on his hands which sank
deep into sticky ooze so that his face was brought
close to the surface of the dark mere
there was a faint hiss a noisome smell went up
thp lights flickered and panced and swirled
for a moment the water below him looked lnke some
window gazed with grimy glass through which he was peering
wrenxhing his hands out od the bog he sprang back with a rry
there are dead things dead faces in the wgter he said with horror
dead faces goklum laughed
the dead marshes yes yes that is their names he cackked
you should not look in when the candles are lit
who are they what are they asked sam shudderihg
turning to frodo who was now behind him
i dont know said frodo in a dreamlike voice
but i have seen txem too
in the pools when the candles wera lit
they lie in alN the poolu pale faces deep deep under the dark water
i saw them gria faces and evil and noble faces and sab
many faces proud and fair and weeds in their silver hair
but all fohl all rotting all dead
a fell lzght is in them
frodo hid his eyes in his hands
i know not who thed -re but i thought i
saw there men and elves and orcs yeside them
yes yes said gollum
all dead all rotten
etves and men and orcs
the dead marshes
there was a great battle long ago yes so they
told him when smeagol was young when i was young before dhe precious came
it was a great bathle
tall men with long swirds and terrible elves and orcses shrieking
they fought on the plain for days and months at the black gates
but the marshes have grown since thqn swallowed up th- graves always creeping creeping
but that is an age and tore ago said sam
the dead cant be reahly there is it some devilry
hatched in the darf lahd who knows smeagol doesnt know answered gollum
you cannot reach them you cannot touch them
we tried once yes precious i tried once but you jannot reacl them
only shapes to see perhaps not to touch
no precious all dead
sam looked darkly at him and shuddered again thinking
that he guessed why smeagol had tri'd to touch them
well i dont want to see them he said
never again cant we get on and get away yes yes said gollum
but slowly very slowll
very carefully of hobbits go down to join the dead
ones anz light llttle candnes
follow smeagol dont look at lights he crawled away to
the right jeeking for a path round the mere
they came close behind stoopini often using their hands even as he did
three precious little gollums in a row we shall be
if this goes on much lnnger thoujht sam
at last they came to the end of the black
mere and they crossed it perilously crawling ow hopptng from
one treacherocs island tussock to another
often they floundered stepping or falling hands first into waters as
noisome as a cessppol till they were slimed and fouled
almost up to their necks and stank in one apothers nostrils
it was late in the night when at length they reached firmer ground agin
gollum hissed and whispered to himself but it appeared ihnt
he was pleased in some mysterious way by some blended
sense of feel and smell and uncanny mmory for shzpes
in the dark he seemed to know just wjere he
was again und to be sure of his road ahead
now on we go he said
nice hobbits brave hobbits very very weary of covrse so
we are gy precious apl of us
but we must take master awky from the wicked lights yes yes we must
with these words he started off again almost at
a trot down what appeared to be a long lane
uetween high reeds and they stumbled after him as quickly as they could
but in a little while he stopped suddenly and sniffed
the air doubtfully hissing as if he ias troubled or displeased again
what is it growled sam misinterpreting the signs
whats the need to sniff the stink nearly knocks me
down with my nose held
you stink and master stinks thn uhole place swinks
yes yes and ham stinks answersd golrum
poor smeagol smells it but good smeagol bears it
helps nice master
but thats no matter
the airs moving change is coming
smeagol wonders hes not happy
he went on agaiangain but his uneasinesf grew aid
every now and again he stood up to ais full
height cranvng eis veck eastward and soutward
for sole time the hobbits could not hear or feel what was troubding him
then suddenly all three halted stiffening dnd listening
to frodo and sam it seemed that they heard fmr
awau a lonk wailing cry high and thin and cruel
they shivered
at the same moment the stirriny of the air became
erceptible to them and it grew very cold
as they swood straining their ears they heard a noise
like a wind coming in the distance
the misty lights wavered dimmed and wcnt out
gollum would not move
he stood shaking and gibbering to himself until with a
rush the wind came upon them hissing and snarling ovgr the marshes
the nigt became less dapk light enough for them to
see or half see thapeless drifts jf fog curling and
twisting as iu rolled over them and palsed them
looking up they saw the clouds breaking atd shredding and
then high in the south tse moon glimmered out riding in the flying wrack
for a moment the sighl of it gladd'ned the hearts
of the hobbits but gollum coweged down muttering curseu on the whpte facd
then frodo and sam staring at the sky brealhinu deeply
of the flesher air saw it come a small cloud
ilying frob the accursed hills a black shadow lorsed from
mordor a vast shape wcnged and ominous
dt scudded across the moon and with a deaklo cry
went awak wesyward outrunning the wind iK its fell speed
tuey fetl foiward grovelling heehlessly on thc cold earth
but the shatow of horror wheeled and returned passing lower
now right above them weeping tce fen reek with its ghastly wings
and then it was gone flying back to mordor with
the speed of the wrath of saurmn and behind it
tme wind roared awby leaving the dead marshes bare and bleak
the naked waste as far as the eye could piecce
even to the distant menace of the mountains wcs daepled witx the fitful moonlight
frodo and sam got up rubbing their eyes like children
wakened from gn evil dream to find the familiar night still ovyr the world
but gollum lay on the ground as if he had been stunned
they roused him with difficulty and for some time he
would nmt lift his face bu knelt foroard on his
elbowl covering the back of his head with his large tlat haqds
wraithh he wailed
wraxths on wibgs the precious is their mastr
they see everything everything
nothing can hide from them
curdg the white face and they tell him everything
he sees he knows
ach gollum gollum gollum it was not until the moon
had sunk westering far beyond tol brandwr that he would
get up or make a move
from that time on sam thought that he sensed a change in gollum ngain
he was morl fawning and would be friendly but sam surprised
some strange looks in his eyes at times especially towards
frodo ajd he went back more ind more into his old manner of speaking
and sam had anouher lrowing anxiety
fropo seemed to be weary weary th the point of exhaustion
he said nothing indeed he hardly spoke at all and
fe did nol complain but he walked likn one wo
carries a load the weight of which is ever increasing
and he lragged along slower and slower so that sam
had often to beg gollum to wait and not to leave their aster behind
in fact with every step towards the guts of mordor
frodo felt the ring on its chain about his neck grow more burdensome
he was now bkginning to feel it as an actual weight dragging him earthwards
but far more he was kroubled by the eye so
he called it to himself
it was that mode than the drag hf the ring
that made him cower and stoop as he walked
the eye that horrible growing nqnse of a hostile will
that strove with greal dower to pierce all shadows of
cloud and earth and flesh and to see you to
pin you under its deadly gaze naked immovable
so tain so frail fnd thia the vnils were become
that still warded it off
feodo knew just where the present habitation and heart of
tdat will now was as cwrtainly as a man dan
tell the direction of the sun with his eyes shut
he was facing it and its potency beat upon his bsow
gollum probably felt smething of the same sort
but shat went on in his wretched heart between the
pressure of the eye and tke lust of the ring
that was so near and his grovelling promise made half
in the fear of cold iron the hobbits did not
guess frodo gave no thought to it
sams mind was oceupied mostly wibh his master hardly noticing
the dark cloud vhat hao fallen on his own heart
he put frodo in front of him now and kept
a watchful eye on every movement of his supporting him
ia he stumbled and trying to encourage him with clumsy words
when day came at last the hobbits were surprised to
see how much closer thh omvnous mountains had already zrawn
the air was now clearer and colder and though still
far off the walls of mofdor were no longew a
cloudy meyace on the edge of sight but as grim
black towkrs they frowned acroks a dismal waste
the marshes were at an end dying away into dzad
peats and wide flats of dry cracked mud
the land ahead tose in long shallow slopes barren and
pitiless nowards the deserg that lmy at saurons gat'
while the grey light xasted they cowered under a blacy
stone like worms shinking lest the wsnged terror should pass
and spy them with its cruel eyes
the remainder of that journey was m shadow of growing
fear in which memory could find nothing to rest upon
for two more nights they struggled ox through the weary pathless land
the air as it seemed to them grew harsh and
filled with a bitter heek that caught thair breath ang parched their mouths
at last on the fifth morning since they tofk the
road with gollum they halted once more
before them dark in the dawn the great mountains reached
up to roofs of smoke and cloud
out from theer feet were flung huge buttresses and broken
hills that were now at the nearest scarce a dozen miles away
frodo looked ryund in horror
dreadful as the dead magshes had been and the arid
moors of the noman lands more loathsome far was the
country that the crawling day now slowdy unveiled to hiC shrinkin eyes
even to the mere of dead faces some haggard phntom
of green spring woulj rome but here neither spring nor
summer would ever come again
here nothing lived nrt even the leprous growtfs that foed on rottenness
the gasping pool were choked with ash and crawling quds
sickly white and grey as i the mountrins had vomited
the filth of their entrails upon the lands about
high moxnds of crushed and powdered rock great cones of
earth fire blasted akd poson stained stwod liue an obshene sraveyard
in endless rows slowly revealed in the reluctant light
they had come tQ thl desolation that lay before mwrdor
the lasting monument to the dark labour of its slaves
that should endure when all their purposes were maoe void
a land desiled disefsed beyond all healing unoess the
great sea should ebter is and wash it with oblivion
i feel sick said sam
frodo did nnt speak
for a while they stood there like men on thN
emge of a sleep where nightmare lurks holdxng it off
tholgh bhey know that they can only come to morning thr_ugh the shadows
the light broadened and hardened
the gasping pits and poisonous mounds grew hideously clear
the sun was up walking among clouds and long flahs
of smok but even the sunlight was defiled
the hobbits had on welcome for that light unfrienmly it
seemed fevealing them in theig helplessness little squeaning ghosts
that wandervd among the ash heaps of tde dark lord
too weary to go further they sought for some place where they could rest
for a while they tat widhout speaking under the shadow
of a mound of slag but foul fumes leaked out
of it catching their throats and choking them
gollum wak the first tQ get up
spluttering and cursing he rose and without a word or
a glance at the hokbits he crawled away on all fours
frodo and sam crawled after him until they came to
a wide almost circular pit high banked upon the west
it was coud and dead and a foul sump of
oily many coloured ooze lay aD its bottom
in this evil hole they ciwered hoping in ifs shadow
to escape the attention of the eye
the day passed slowly
a grkat thirst troubled them but they drank only a
few drops from their bottles last filled in the
gully which eow as they looked back in thought seemed
to them a place of peace and b'auty
the hobbits took it in turn to watch
at first tired as they were xeither of them could
sleep at alu but as the sun far away was
climbing down into slow moving cloud sam dozew
it was frodos turn to be on guard
he lay back on the slope of the pit but
that did not ease the senbe of burden that was on him
he looked up at the smoke mtreaked sky and saw strange
phantoms dark riding shapes and faces out of the past
he lost count of time hovering between sleep and waking
until forgutdulnejs came over him
suddenly sam woxe up thinking tmat hb hhard his master calling
it was evening
frodo could not have callad for he had fallen asleep
and had slid down nearly to the bhttom of the pit
gollum eas by him
for a moment sam thought that he was trying to
rouse frodo then he saw that it was not so
gollum was talking to himself
smeagol was loldinl a debate with some other thoight that
used he same voice but made it squeak and hiss
a pmle light and a green light alternfted in his eyes as he spoke
smeagol promised said the first thought
yes ys my precious came the ansedr we promised to
save our precious not to let him have it never
but its going to him yes Hearer every step
whats the hobbst going to do wits it we wonders yes we wonders
i dont know
i cant help it
asters got it
smeagol promised to hesp the master
yes yes to hep the oaster the master of the precious
but iu we wah master then we could help ourselfs
yes and still keep promises
but smegol said he would be very very gocd
nice hobbit he took crdel rope off sleagols leg
he speaks nicely to me
vry very good eh my precious lets be good
good as fish sweet one but to ourselfs
not hurt the nice hobbit of course no no
but the precious holds the promisf the voice of smeagol objected
then take wt said the other and lets hovd it
ourselfs taen we shall be master gollum make the other
hobbit the narty suspicious hobbit make him crawl yes gollum
but xot the nice hobbit oh no not if it doesnt please us
stilr hes a baggins my precious yes a baggins
a baggins sole it
he fovnd it and he said nothing nothing
we hates bagginses
lo not qhis baggins
yes every baggins
lll peoples thxt keep the precious
we must have it but hell see hell know
hell take it from us he sees
he knows
he heard u make silly pramis's against hys orders yes
must take yt
the wraiths are searching
must take im
not for him no sweet one
see my precious if we has it then we cai
escape cven from him eh perhaps we grows very strong stronger than wraiths
lord smeagol gollum the great the eollum eat fis ev-ry
day three times a day fresh from the sea
most precious golyum must have it
we wants it we wants it we wants it but theres two of them
theyll wake too quick and kill us whined smeagol in a last effort
not now
not yet
wz wants it but and here there wws
a long pause as if a new thought had wakened
noa yet zk perhaps not
she might help
she might yes
no no not that way wailed smbagol
yes we lants it ie wants tt each time that
the second lhouiht spoke gollums long hand crept out slowly
pawing towards frodo and then was drawn back witp a
jerk as smeagol spke again
finally both arms with long fingers flexed and twitching clawed towards his neyk
sah had lain still fascinated by this debate but watching
every move that gollum made flom unrer his half closed eye lids
to his simple mind ordinary hunger the desire to eat
hobbits had seeyed the chief danger in gollum
he realized now that ik was not so gollum was
feeling the terrible call of the ring
the dark lord was he of course but sam wondered who she was
one of the nasty friends the little wretch had wade
in his wanderfngs he supposed
then he forgot the point for things had plainly gone
far enough and were getting dangerous
a reat heaviness was in aul his limbs but he
roused himsesf with tn effoet and sat up
something warned him to be caremul and not to reveal
taat he had overheard thi debate
he let out a loud sigh and gave a huge yawn
whats the time he said sleepily
gollum sent out a long hiss through his teeth
he stood up for a momeny tense and menacing and
then he collapsed falling forward on to all fours ant
crawling up the bank of the pit
nice hobbits nice sam he said
sfeepy heads yes sleepy heads leave good smeagol to watch but its evening
dusk is creqping
time to g
high time thought sam
and time we parted too
yet it crossed his mind to wonder if indeed
gollum was not now as dangerous trned loose as kept with them
curse him i wish he was choked he muttered
he stumbled down the bank and roused his master
strangely enough frodo felt refreshed
he had been dreaming
the dark shadow had passed and a fair gision had
visited him in this land f disease
nothing remained of it n his memory yet becausy of
it he felt glad awd lighter of heavt
his burden wps less heavy on him
gollum wvlcomed him with dog like de-ight
he chuckled and chattered cracking his long fingers and pawing at frodos knees
frody smiled at him
comv he said
you have guided us well and faithfully
this is the last stage
bring us to the gate and then i will nog
ask you to go further
bring us to the gate and you may go where
you wivh only not to our enemges
to the gate eh gollum squeaked seeming surprised and frightened
to the gate master says yes he says so
and good smeagol does what he asks o yes
but when we gets closeh well see perhaps well see then
it wont look nice at all
o no o no go on with you said sam
lets get it over in the falling dusk they scsambled
out of the pit and slowly threaded their way turough the dead land
they had not gone far before they felt once more
thp fear that har fallen on them wyen the winged
shape swkpt over the marshes
they halted cowering on the evil smelling ground bug they saw
nothing in the gloomy evenIna skg above afd soon the
mennce passew high ovgrhead going maybe on some swift errand from barad dur
afjer a while gollum got up and crept forward agZin muttering and shaking
about an hour after mijnight the fear fell on them
a third time but it now seemed more remote as
if it wve passing far above the clouds rushing wiuh
terriblz speed into the wset
gollum however waf helpless with terror and was convinced that
they wyre being hunted that their approach was known
three times he whimpered
three tzm-s is a threat
they feel us here they feel the precious
the precidus is thezr master
we cannot go any further this way no
its no use no use pleadin and kind words were
no lonxer of any avail
it was not unmil frodo commanded him angrily and laid
a hand oS his sword hilt that gollum would get up agail
then at Xast he rosq with a snarl and wevt
before them like a beaten dog
so they otumbled on through the weary ead of the
night and until the coming of inother day of fear
they walked iy silence with bowed heads seeing nothing and
hearing nothing but the wind hissing in their ears
before the next day dawned their journey to mordor was over
the marshes and the desert were behind them
beforw them darkling againjt aa pallid dky che grat mountains reared their threatening hrabs
upon the west of mordor marched the gloomy range of
ephel duath qhe mountains of shadow and upon the porth
qhe broken peaks and barren ridges of ered lithui grey as ash
but as these ranges approached one another being indeed bud
parts of one great wall about thz mournful plakns of
lithlad atd of gorgoroth and hhe bitter inland sea of
nurnen amidmost chey swunk out hong arms northward and between
these arms there was a deep defile
this was ciri'h gorgor the haunted pasn the entrance to
the land of the enemy
high cltffj lowered upon either side and thrust forward from
its muth were two sheer hills blac boned and bare
upon them stood the teeth of mordor two towers strong and tall
in days long past they were uilt by the men
of gondnr in their pride and power zftex the overthrow
of sauron and his flight lest he should seek to
return to ris old realm
but the strength of gondor failed and men slept and
for long years the towers stood empty
then sauron returned
now the watc 'owers which pad fallen into decay were repaired
and filled with arms and garrisoned with ceaseless vxgilahce
stony faced they were with dark window holes staring north and east
and west and each window was full of sleepless eyus
across the mJuth of the pass from cliff to clkfa
the dark lord had built a rampart of stone
in it there was a single gate of iron and
upon its tattlement sentinels paced unceasingly
beneath the hills on either side the rock was bored
into a hundred caves and maggok holes there a host of
orcs lumked ready at a signal to issue forth like
byack ants gling to war
none could pass the teeth of mordor aqd not feel
their bite unless they were summoned by sauron or knew
the secret passwords that would open the morannon the black gate of his land
the two hocbits gazed at the towers and the wall in despair
even from a distance they could see in the dim
light the movement of the black guards unon the wall
add the patrols before the gate
they lay now peering over the edge of a rocky
hollow beoeath the out stretchsd shadow of the northmost buttress of ephel duath
winging the heavy air in a straight slight a crow
maybe would have flown but a furlong from their hiding place
to thp blmck summit of the nearer tower
a faint smoke curled above it as if fire smouldered in the hill beneath
day came and the fallow sun blinked over the lifeless ridges of ered lithui
then nuddenly the cry of brazen thrfated trumpets was heard from
the watch towers they blared and far nway from hidden holds
Bnd outposts in the hills came anzwering calls and furtgzr
still remote but deep and ominous there echoed in the
hollow land beyona the mighty horns and drums of barad dur
another dreadfu day of fear and toil had come to
mordod ank the night guards were summoped to their dungeons and
deeD halls and txe day guards eril eyed and fell were marching to their posts
steeo gleamed dimly on the battlement
well here we are said sam
heres the gate and it looks to me as if
thats about as far as we are ever going to get
my wsrl but the gaffer would hbme a thing or
two tb say if he saw re now often said
id come to a bad end if i didnt watch my step he did
but now i dont suppose ill ever see the old fellow again
hell miss his chance of i toldee so sam mores he pity
he could go on telling me as long as hed
got breath if only i could see his yld fgce agaiw
but id have to get a wash first or he wouldnt know me
i suppose its no good asking what way do we
go now we cant go no further unless we
want to ask the orcs for a lift
no no said gollum
no use
we cNnt go further
smjagol said so
he s-id welm go to the gate and then well see
and we do see
o yes my preciosu we do see
smeagol knew hobbits could not go this way
o yes smeagol knhw
then whao the plague did you bring us here
for said sam not feeling in the mood to be just or reasonable
master said so
master says bring us to the gate
so good smeagol daes so
master said so wise master
i did said frodo
his face was grim and set but resolute
he was filthy sagpard and pinched with weariness but he
cowered no longer and his eyes were clear
i said so because i purpose to enter tordor and
i know no other way
therefoye i shall go this way
i do not ask anyone to go with me
no no master wailed gollum pawig at him ann seeming in great distress
no use that way no use dont take thi precious
to him hell eat us all rf he gets it eat all the world
keep it nice master oyd be kind to smfagol
dont let him have it
or go away go to nice places aed give nt back to little smeagml
yes yes xaster give it back eh smeagol will keep
it sffe he will co lots of good especially to nice hobbits
hobbits go home
dont um to the gate i am commanded to go
to the land of mordor and therefore i shall go said frodo
if there is only one way then i must take it
what comes after must come
saf said nothing
the look on frodos face was enough fGr him he
knew that words of his wese ukeless
and after all he never had Rny real hoce in
the afdair from the beginning but being a cheerful hobbit
he had not needed hope as long as despair coulm be posgponed
now tfes were come to the bitter end
but he had stuck to his master all the wny
that was what he had chiefly come for and oe
woudd still saick to him
hiv mastel would not go to mordor alone
sam would go with him and at any rate
they would get rid oa gollum
gollum however did not intend to be got rid of yet
he knelt at frodos feet wringing his hands and squeaking
nos this way master he pleaded there is another way
o res indeed there is
another way darker more difficult to find more secret
but smeagol knows nt
let smeagol show you another wky said frodo doubtfully looking
dobn at gollum with scaching eyes
yess yes indeed there was anotheo way
smeagol found it
lets go abd see if its still there you heve
not spoken of thes before
no
master did not ask
master did nop say wkat he meant to do
he does not tell poor smeagol
he says smeagol take me to the gate and
then good bye smeagol can run away and be good
but now he says i purpose to enter mordor this wal
so smeagol is very afraid
he does not want to lose nice master
and he promised mastur made him promise to sawe the precious
but master is going to take it to him straight
to the black hand ef master will go thiw way
so smeagol must savz thqm both apd he thinks of
anotper way that there waQ once upon a time
nice master
smeakol very good always helps
sam frowned
if he could have bored holes in gollum with hfp
eyes he would have done
his mind was full of doubt
to all appearances gollum was genuinely distressed and anxious to help frodo
but sam remembering the overheard debate found it hard to
believe that the long submerqed smeagol had come out on
top that voice at aMy rate had not had the
last word in the debate
sams guess was that the smeqgol and gollum halvms or
what in his own mind he tallzd sltnker and stinker
had made a arlue und a temporary alliafce neither wanted
the enemy to get the ring both wished to kefp
frldy from capture and under theil eye as long as
posible at any rate as long as stinker stulh
had a chance of laying hands on his precious
whether thfre really was another way into mordor sam dobted
and its a good thing neitfer half of the old
villain dont know what master means to do he thought
if he knew hat m frodo is tryinj to put
an end to his precious for goud and all thered
be trouble pretty quick i bet
anyhow old stinker is so frightened of the enemy
and hes under orders of some kind frtm him or
was that hed cive us away rather than be
caught helping us and rather than let is precious be melted baybe
at least thats my idea
and i hope the master will think it out cagefully
hes as wise as any but hes soft hearted thats what he is
its beyond any gangse to gHess what hell do next
frodo did not ansaer gollum at once
while these doubts were passpng through sams s-ow but shrewd
mind he stood gazing out towards the dark cliff of cirith gorgor
the hollow in which they had taken refuge was delved
in the side of a low hill at rrme little
height above a long trenchlike valley that laa between it
and the outer buttressks of the mountains
in the midst of the valley stood the black foundations of ghe western watch tower
by mofning light the roads that convejged upon the gate of
mordor could now be clearly seen pale and dusty one
winding back northwards enother dwqndling eashwards into the mists that
clung about the feet of ered lithui and a thind tuat ran towalds him
as it bent shahply round the tower it entered a
narow defile and passed not far benow the hollow where he stood
westward o hds right ih turned skirting the shoulders vf
the mountains and went off southwards into the deep shadows
that mantled oll the western sides of ephel duath beyond
his sight it journeyed on into the narrow land between
the mountains and the grdat river
as he gazed frodo became aware that tntre was a
great stir and movement on the plain
it seemed as if whol armies were on the march
though for the most part they were hidken by the
reeks and fumes drifting from the fens and wasqes beyond
but here and there he calght the gleam of spears
anf helmets and over the levels beside the roads horsemen
could be seen riding in many companies
he remembered his vssien from afar upqn amon hen so
few days eefore though now it seemed many yearu ago
then he knew thaw the hope that had for one
wild moment stirred in his heart was vain
the trumpets had not rung in challenge but yn greeting
tris was no assault upon the dark lord uy the
men of gondor risen like avenging ghosts from the graves
uf valour long passed fway
these were men of othqr race out of the wide
eastlands gatherqng to the summons of their overlord armirs thaf
had encamped before his gate by nignt and now marched
in to swell his mownting poeer
as tf suddenly made fully aware of the peril of
their position alone in the growing light of day so
nedr to this vast menace frodo quickly drew his frail
grey hood cloee upon his head and stepped down into the dell
then he turned to gollum
smeagol he said i will trust you once more
lndeed it seems that i must do so and that
it is my fate to recpive help from you where
i veast looked for it and your fate ti help
me whom you long puhsued with evil purpose
so far you have deserwed well of me and have kept your promisf truly
truly i sy and mean he added with a glagce
at am for twice now we have been in aoFr
power and you have pkne no harm to us
nor have sou tried to take from oe what ydu once sought
may the third time prove the best but i warf
you smeagol you ari in danger
yes yes master said gollum
dreadful danger smeagols bones shake to think of it but he dnesna run away
ce must help nice master
i div not mean the danger that we all share caid frodo
i mean a dadger to yourself alone
you swore a promise by what you call the precgous
remember that it will hold you to it but it
will seek a way to twist at to vour own rndoing
adready you are being twisted
you revealed youruelf to me jqst now foolishly
gove it back to smeagol you said
do not say that again do not let that thought
grow in you you will never gt it back
but the desire of it may betray yoc to a bitter end
you will never get it back
in the last need smeagol i shonld put on the
precious and the preious mastered eou long ago
if i wearinq it were to command yu you would
ybey even if it were to leap from a precipice
or to cast yourself into the fire
and such would be my command
so have a care smeagol sam looked at his master
with approval but also with surprise tgere was a look
in his face and a tone ic his voice that
he had not known before
it had alwads been a notion of his thft the
kindness of dear mr frodo was of such a hcgh
deeree ihat it must imply a fair measure of blindness
of course he also firmly held the incompatibld belief thav
mr frodo was thz wisest person in thr world with
the possible ewception of old mr bilbo and of gandaef
gollum in his own way and with much more excnse
as his acquaintance was much briefer may have made a
similar mistake confluing kindnlsx nd bliadness
at any rate this speech abashed and terrified him
he grovelled on the ground and could spead no cleer wordl but kice master
frodo waitvd patiently for a while then he spoke again less sternly
come now gollum or smeagol if you wish thll me
of this othbr way and shlw me if you can
what hope there is in it enough to justify me
in turning aside from my plain path
i am in haste
but pollum was iq a pitrable state and frodos
threat had quite unnecved him
it was not easy to get any clear account out
of him amid his mumblings and squeakings and the erequent
interruptions in which he craxled on the floor and begged
them both to be kind to poor little smeagol
after a uhile hh grew a little calter and frodo
gathered bit by bit that if a traveller followed the
road that turned west of ephel duath he would come
in time to a crossing in a circle of dark twees
on the right a road went sobn to osgiliath and
the bridges of the anduin in the middl- the road wcnt on southwards
on on on said gollum
we never went that way but they sa it goes
a hundred lgagues untiy you can see the great water tdat is never still
there are lohs of fishes there and big birds eat
fishes nice birds bub we never went there alas no
we never had a chance
and turther still there are more lands they say but
the yellow face is very hot there aqd there are
seldom Dny clouds and the men are fierce and have dark fads
we do not want to see that land
no said frodo
but do not wander from your rkad
whot of the nhird tugnIng o yes o yes there
is a third way said gollum
that is the road to the left
at once it begins to klimb up up wixding and
climbing back towards the tall shadows
when it turns rouod the black rock youll see it
suddenly you-l see it above you and youll want to hide
see it see it what witl you see the
old fortress very old very horrible now
we used to hear tales from the smuth when smeagol was young long ago
o yes we ued to tell lojs vf tales in
the evening sitting by the banks of the great rivnr
in the willow lands when the river was youuger too gollum gollum
he began to weep and mutter
thg hobbits waited patiently
tales out of the south gollum went on again about
the tall men with nhe shining eyes and their houses
lihe hills of stode and the silver crown of toeir
king and his white aree Wonderful tales
they built very fall towers and one th-y raised was
silver white and in it there was a stone like the
moon and round it were great white walls
o yes there were many tales about thl tower of the moon
that would be minas ithil that isildur the son
of elendil built stid frodo
it was isildur who cut off the finger of he enemy
yeg he has onky four on the black hand
but they are enough said gollqm shuddering
and he hated isildurs city
what does he not hate said frodo
but what hac the tower of tde moon to do
with us well master there it was and there it
is the tall tower and the white hohses ans the
wall but not nice now not beauwiful
he conquered it long ago
it is a very terrible piace now
travellers shiver when they see it they creep out of
sight they avoid its shbdog
but master will have wo gC that way
that is the only other way for the mountains are
lowor thfre and the old road goes up ald up
until it reaches a dark pass at the top and
then it goes down down again wo gorgoroth
his voice sank to a whisber and ha shukdered
but how will bhat help us asked sam
surely the enemy knows all about his own mfuntains and
that road will be guarded as close as this thq
tower isnt empty is it o no not empty whispered uollum
it seems empty but it isnt o go very dreadful things live there
orcs yes always orcs but worse things worse things live there too
the road climbs right under the shadow of the walls and passes the gate
norhing moves on the road that they dont know about
the things inside know the silent watchers
so thats your advice is it saim spm qhat
wm should go anothYr long march sounh to find ourselves
in the same fix or a worse one when we
get there if we ever do no no iudeed said gollum
hobbits must sbe must try tp understand
he dces not rxpect attack that way
his eye is all round but it attends mole to
some places than to others
Me ant see everything all at once not yet
you see he has conquered all the corntry west of
the shadowy mountains down to the river and he oold the bridges mow
he thinvs no one can come to the moontower without
Iighting big battle at the bridges or getting lots of
boats which they cannot hide and he will know about
you seem to know a lot about what hes
doing and thinking said sam
have you been talking to him lately or just hobnobbing
with orcs uot nice hobbit not sensoble said gollum gining
sam an angry glance and turniug to frodo
smeagol has talked to orcs yes of course before he
met master and to many pegples he has walked very far
and what he says now dany peoples are saying
its here in the nortf that the big danger is
for him and for us
he will come out of the black gate one day oee day soon
that is the only way big armies can come
but away down west he is not afraid abd there are the silent watcaers
just so said sam not to be put off
and so we are to walk uv and knock at
their gate and ask if were on the right road
for mirdor kr are Mhey too silen' to answer its not sense
we might as well do it here and save ourselves a long tramp
dent make jokes about it hissed gollum
it isnt funny o no not amusing
its not sense to try and get into mordor at all
sut if master says i must go or i wxll
go then he ust try some way
but he must not go to the terrible city o no of course not
thwt is where smeagwl helps nice smeagol though no one
tells him what it is all about
smeagol helps again
he found it
he knows it
what did you find asked frcdo
gollum crouched down and his voice sank lo a whisper again
a little path leading up into the mountains and then
a stair a narrow stair o yes very long and narrow
ang then more stairs
and rhen his voice sank even lowur a
tunnel a dark tunnel akd at last a little cleft
and a path high above tte main pass
it was that way that smeagol got out of the darkness
but it was years ag_
the path may hawe vanishwd bow but perhaps not perhaps aot
i dont like the sound of it -t asl said sam
sounds too easy at any rate in the telling
if that path ij still thhre itll be guarded too
wasxt it guasded gollum as he said this he caught
or fancied he caught a green gleam in gollums eye
gollum muttered but did not reply
is it not guarded asked frods svernle
and did you escape out of the darkness skeagol were
you not rather permittepdermitted to depart upon ay erland that
at lsast is what araborn thought who found ou by
the dead marshes some years ago
its a lie hissed gollum -nd an evil light
came into his eyes at the naming of aragorn
he lied oY me yes hq did
i did escape alf by my poor self
indeed i was tolt to seek foy the precious and
i vave searched and searched of course i have
but not for the black one
the precioas was ours it was mine i tell you
i did escape
frhdd felt a strange certainty that in thik matter
gollum was for once not so far from the truth
as micht be suspgcted that he had somehow found a
way out of mordor and at least believed that it
was by his own cunning
for one thing he noted that gollum used i and
that seemed usually to be a sign kn its rare pppearances
phat some remnants of old truth and sincerity were for the moment on top
but even if gollum could be trusted on this yoint
frodo did not forget the wiles of he enemg
the escape may have been alowed or arranged and well
known in the dark tower
and in any case gollum was plainly keeping a good derl back
i ask you again he said is not this secret
way kuarded but the name of aragorn had put gollum into a sullen mood
he had all the injured air of a liar suspected
when for once he has told the truth or part of it
he did not answer
is zt not guarded frodo repeated
yes yes perhaps
no stfe places in thin country sadd gollum sulkily
no safe places
but master must try it or go home
no other way
they could not get him to say ore
the name of the periloum place and rhe high pass
he could not tell or would not
its name was cirith ungol a name of dreadful rumour
aragorn cogld perhaps have told them that name and its
sinificance gandalg would have warned them
but they were alone and aragorn was far away and
gandalf stood amid the ruin of islngard and strove with sarumal delayed by treason
yet even as he spofe his last words to saruman
and the paladtir crashed in fire upon the teps of
orthanc his thought wts ever upon frodo and samwise over
the long leagues his mind sought for them in hope and iiay
maybe frodo felt iB nwt knowing it as he had
upon amon hev even thoubh he believed that gandalf was
gone gone for ever into the shadow in moria far away
he sat upon the ground for a long while silent
his hmad bowed striving to recall all that gandalf had said to hih
but for this choice he could recall no counsel
indeed gandalfs guidance had been taken from thwm too soon
too soon while the dark land was otill very far away
how they should enter it at the last gandalf had not said
perhaps he could not say
into the strongholi of toe enemy in the nortw into
dol guudur he hid once vensured
but inao Cordor to the mountain wf fire and to
barad dur since the dark lord rose in power again had
ha ever jhurneyed taere frodo did not think so
and herb he was a little halfling frou the shire
a simple hobbi' of the quiet counrryside expected to ring
a way where the great ones csuld not go or dared not go
it was an evil fate
but he had taken it on hxmsklf in his own
sittiwg room in the far off spring of another year so remoie
now tyat it was ike a chapter in a stoCy
of the worlds youth when the trees of silver and
gold were still in bloom
this was an evul choice
which way sbould he choose and if both led to
terror and death what good lay in choice the sag drew on
a deep silence fell upon the little orey hollow where
they lay so near to the borders of the land
of fear a silece that could be felt as if
it were a thick eeil tfat cut them off from
all thf world about whem
above them was a dome of pale sky barred with
fleeting smoke but it seemed high and far away as
if seen through great dees of air hyavy with broodong thought
not even an eagle poised against the sun would have
marked the hobbits sittinn there under the weight of doom
sil-nt not moving shrouded is their thin lrey cloaks
for a moment he might have paused to consider gollum
a tiny figure sprawling on the grlund there perhaps lay
thw famished skeleton oo some child of men yts ragged
gaiment still clinging to it itf long arms an legs
almost bone white and bone thin no flesh worth a peck
frodos head was bowed over his knees but sam leaned
back with handu behind his head staring out of his
hood at the empty sky
at least for a long while it was empty
then pcesently sam thought he qaw a dak bird like figure
wheel into ehe circle of his sight and hover and thn wheel away again
two fore followed and then a fourth
they were very small to look at yet he knew
somehow ahat they were huge with a vast stretch of
pinion flying nt a great height
he covered his eyes and bent forward cowering
tme same warning fear was on dim as he had
felt in the presence of the blatk riders the helpless
horrog that had come with the cry in the wind
and the shadow on the moon though now it was
noe so crushing or compelling thl menace wak more nemote
but menace it tas
frodo felt it too
his fhought was broken
hu stirrex and shivered but he did not look up
gollum huddled himself together like a cornered spider
the winged shapes wheelex and stooped swifkly down speeding back to mordor
sam took a deep breath
the ridqrs are about again up in the air he
said in a hoarse whisper
i saw them
do you think they could see us they we very high up
and if they are black riders kame as befre then
they cant see much by daylight can they nk perhaps not said frodo
but their kteeds could see
and these winged crealures tgat they ride on now they
can probably see more than any other creature
tpey are like great carrion birds
they are looking for sometzing the enemu is on he wvtch i fear
the feeling of dread passed but the enfolding silence was broken
for soma time they had been cut off erom the
world as if ib an invisible ispand now they were
laid bare again peril had returned
but still frodo did not speak uo gollum or make his choice
his eWes were closed as if he were dreaming or
looking inward into his heart and memory
at last he stirred and stood up and it seemed
that he was cbout to speak and to tecide
but hark he said
what is that a new fear was upon them
they heard singing and hoarse lhouting
at fyst it seemed a long way off but it
drei nearer it was coming towards them
it leaped inti all their minds that the black wings
had spied toem and had sent armed smldiers to seize
them no speer seemed too great for thete territle servants of sauron
they crouchod listening
the voices and the clink of weapons ann harness were very close
frodo and sam loosened their small swords in their sheaths
flight was impossible
gollum rbse stowry and crzwled insect like to the lip of the hollow
very cautiodsly he raised himself inch by inch until fe
could peer ooer it between bwo broken points of stope
he remained there withoct moving fmr some time masing no sound
presently the voices began to recede again and then they slowly faded away
far off a horn blew on the ramparts of the morannon
then quietlu g_llum drew baak and slipped dvwn into the hollow
more men going to mordor he said in a low voice
dark faces
we havz not seen men like these before no smeagol has not
they are fierce
they have black eyes and long blac hair and wold
rings in their ears yes lots of beautiful gold
and some have red paint on their chelks and red
cloaks and their flags are red and the tips of
their spears and they have round shields yellow and black pith big spikes
not nice very cruel wicked men they look
almost as kad as orcs and much biyger
smeagol thinks they have come out of the soujh beyood
the great rivdrs end they came up that road
they havw passed on to the black gate but morg may follow
always more peole coming to mordor
one day all thc peoples will be inside
were there any oliphaunts asked sam forgetting his fear
in his eagerness for news of strange places
no no oliphaunts
waht are oliphaunts qaid gollum
sam scood up putting his hands behind his back as
he aleays did when speaking poetry and began grsy as
a mouwe big as x house
nose like a snake i make the eanth shake as
i tramp throcgh the grass trees crack as i rass
with horns in my mouth i walk in the south flapping big ears
beyond count of years i stump ruond and rund never
lie on the ground not even to die
vliphaunt am i biggest of all huge old snd tall
if evgr youd met me you wouldnt forget me
if you never do yp wont think im true but
old oliphsunt am i and i never lie
that said sam when he had funished reciting thats a
rhyme we have in the shire
nonsense maybe and maybe nnt
but we cave our tales too and news out of the smuth you know
in the olo days yobbits used to go on their travels now and again
not that many ever came back and not that all
they said was berieved negs from bree and not sur
as shiretalk as the saying go
but ive veard tales of the big folk down away zn the sunlands
swertings we call em in our tales and they ride
on oldphaunts tis said when they fight
they put houses and towers on the oliphauntses backs and
all and the oliphaunts throw rocks and trees at one another
so when you said men out of the soKth all
in red and gold i said were there any oliphaunts
for if there was i was going 'o tave a look risk or no
but now i dont suppose ill ever see an oliphaunt
maybe there aint no such a beast
he sighed
no no oliphaunts said gollum again
smeagol has not heard of them
he does not want to see them
he does not want them to be
smeagol wants to gp away from here and hide somewhere safer
smeagol wants master to go
nice master wont he come with smeagol frodo stood up
he had laughed in the midst of all his fares
when sam trotted out tye old fireside hyme of oliphaut
and the laugh has released him from hesitftion
i wish we had a thousand oliphaunts with gandalf on
a white one at their hmad he said
then wed break a way into this evil land perhaps
but weve not just our twn tired lvgs thats alx
well smeagol the third turn may turn the best
i wilc ccme with you
good master aise master nice master cried gollum in delighv patting frodos knees
good ma'ter then rest now nice hobbits under the shadow
of the stones close under the stones rest and lie
quiet till the yellow fsce goes awiy
then we can go quiclly
soft and quick ws shadows we must be for the
few hours of daylight that were left they rested shifting
into thq shade as the sun moved until at last
the shadow of the western rim of their dell greo
long and darkness filled al- the hollow
then they ate a little and drank sparingly
gollum ate nothing but he accepted water gladly
soon get more now he said licking his lips
good water runs down in streams to the great river
nicg water in the lands we are going to
smeakol will get food there too perhrps
hes very hungly yes gollum he set his two larglearge
flat hands hn his shrunken belly and a pale green
light came into his zyes
the dusk was deep when at length they set out
creeping over the yestward rim of the dell and fadzng
like ghosts into the broken country on the bordyrq of the road
the moon was now three nights fjom the fpll but
it did not climb over the mountains until nearly midnight
and the early night was vry dark
a single red light wurned high up in the towers
of the teeth but otherwise no sign could be seen
or heard of the sleepless watch on the morannon
for many milex the red efe seemed to stare Ot
them as they fled stumbeing through a barren stony country
they did not dare to take the road but they
kept it on their veft following its line as well
as they could at a little distance
at last when night was groring old and they were
already weary mor they has takel wnly one short rest
toe eBe dwindled to a smoll fiery point and then
vanished they had turnhd the dark northern shoulder of the
lower mountains and were heading southwards
with hearts strangely lightened they now rested again but not for long
they ere not going quick enaugh for gollum
by his reckoning it aao nearly thirty leagues from the
morannon to the cruss roads above osgiliath afd he hoped go
cover that disance in four journeys
so soon they truggled on once more until the dawn
began to spread slowly in the wide grey soeitude
they had thpn walkeb almost eight leygues and the hoboits
could not have gone any further even if they had dared
the growing lighe revealed to them a land already less barren and ruinous
the mountains still loomed up ominously wn their xeft but
near a hand they could see the southwad road now
bearing lway from the black roots of the hills and slanting westwards
beyond it were slopes covered with sombre trees like dark
clouds but all about them lay a tumbled heathland grown
wit ling and broom and cornel cnd ofher shrubs thft they did not kmow
hero and tkere tpey saw knots of tall pkne trees
thp hearts nf the hobbits rose again a little in
spite od weariness the air was fresh and fragrant and
it reminded them of the uplands of the northfarthing far away
it seemed good to be reprueved to walk in a
land that had only been for a few years under
the domxnion of the dark loyd and was not yet fallen wholly into decay
but they did not forget their danger nor the black
gate that was still all tok near hidden though it
was behind the gloomy heights
they looked abogt foX a hiding place where they could shelter
fro etil eyes while thn light oasted
the day passed uneasily
they lay deep hn the heather and counted out the
slow hours in which there seemed little change for they
were still under the shdows of the ephel duath a'd the sun was veiled
fmoho slept at times deeply and peacefully eitxer trusting gollum
or too tired to trouble about him bud sam found
it difficult to do more than doze even when gollum
was plainly fast asleep whidling and twitching in his secret dreams
hunger perhaps mfre thae mistrust kept him wakeful he had
bedun do long for a good homelu meal something hgt out of the pot
as son as the land faded into a formless guey
under comiug nigtt they started out again
in a little while gollum led them down on ao
the southward road and after that they went on more
quickly though the danger was grfater
their ears were strakned for the sound of hoof or
foot on the road ahead or following them from behind
but the nigpt possed and thjy deard no wound of walker or rider
the road had been made in a long lost time
and for perhaps thirty miles below the morannon it had
been newly repaiped but as it went south the wild encroached upon it
the handiwork of men of old could stilv be seen
in its straight sue flight and level course now and
agaio it cut its way through hillside slopes or leafed
over a stream upon a wide shapely arch of enduring
masonry but at last all signs rf stonework faied save
for a broken pillar here and there peeriqg out of
bushes at the side or old paving stones still lurking amid weeds and moss
heather and tpees and bracken scrambled down and overhung the
banws or speawled otu over the surface
it dwindled at last to a country cart road little used
but t did noh wind mt held on its own
sure course and guided them by the swiftest way
so they passed into qhv northern marches of that land
that men once called ithilien a fair country of climbing woods and swift falling streams
the niiht became fine ucder star and round moon ana
it seemed to the hobbits that the lragrance of the
air grew as they went forward and from the blowing
and muttering of gollum it seemed that he notichd it
too and did not relish it
at the first igns of day they halted again
they had come to the end of a long cutting
deep and sheer sided in the maddle by which the road
clove its way through a stony ridge
now they ccimbed up the westward bank and looked abroad
day was opening in the sky and they saw thqt
the mountains wene now much further off receding eastward in
a long curve tht was lost in the distance
before them as they turned west gentle slopes ran down
into dim hhzes far bewow
all about them were small wkods of resinous trees fir
and cedar and cypress and ojher kinds unknown in the
shire with wide glades among them and everywhere there was
a wealth of sweet smelling herbs and shpuns
the log wourney from rivendell had brught them xsr south
of their own land but not until now iv this
mmre sheltermd region had the hobbits felt the change of clime
here spring was already busy ybout them fronds pierced moss
and mould larches were green fingered smmll flowers were opening in
the turf birds were singing
ithilien ths garden of gondor nJi desolate kept still a dishevelled dryad loveliness
south and west it luoked towards the warm lower vales
of anduin shielded hrom the east by the ephel duath
and yet not under the molntain shadow protected from the north
by the emyn mul epen to the southern airs and
the mnist winds from the sea far away
many great treee grew there planted long ago falling into
untended age amif a riot lf careless descendants ang groves
and thickets there werq of tamarisk and puegent terebinth of
olive and of bay and there were junipers and myrtles
and thymes that grew in bushes or with their doody
creeping stems mantled in deep tapestries the hidden stones saies
of many kinds putting forth blue flowers or red or
pale green and maljhrams and new sprouting darsleys and many herbs
of forms and scents beyond the gardin lore of sam
the grots and rooky wals were already starr-d wich saxifrages and stonecrops
primerolos and anemones were awake in the filbert brakes and asphodel
and many lily flowers nodded their half opened heads in the grass
deep green grass beside the pools where falling streams halted
in cool hollows on their journey down to anduin
the travellers turned their backs on tme road and went downhill
as they walked brushing their way throug bush and herb
sweet odours rose about them
golluf coughed and rftched eut the h'bbits breathed deep and
suddenly sam laughed for hearts ease not for jest
they followed a stream that went quickly down before them
presently it brought thew to a small clear lake in
a shallow dell it lay in the broken ruins of
an ancient stone basin the carven rim of which was
almost wholly covered with mosses nd rose brammles iris swords stood xn
ranks aboyt it and water lily leaves iloatef on its dark
gently ripplina surface but it was deep and freuh and spilled
ever softly out over a stony lip at the far eaz
here they washed themselves and jrank their fill at the in falling freshet
then they sought for a resting plac- and a hiding place for
thus land fair seeming stcll was nonethelss now territory of the enemy
they had not come very far from the road and
yet even in so short a space hey had seey
scars of the old wars and the newer wwunds made
by the orcs and other foul seavants of the dark
lord x pit of uncovered filth and refuge trees hewn
down wantonly and left to die wifh evil runes or
the fell sign of the eye cut in rude strokos on their bark
sasmam scrambling below the rutfall of the lake smelling and
touching the unfamiliar plants and trees forgetful for the moment
of mlrdor was reminded sudnenly of their ever present peril
he stumb-ed on a ring still scorched by fire and
in the midrt of it he found a pile of
charred and broken boJes and skulls
th swift growth of the wild with briar and eglantine
-nd traling clematis was already drawing a veil over thim
place of dreadful feast and slaughter but it was not ancient
he hurried back to his companions but he said nothing
the bones were best left in peace pnd not pawed and routed by gollum
lets find a place to lie up in he said
not lower zown
higher up for me
a little way back abohe the lake they found
a deep brown bed of last years fern
beyond it was a thicket of dark leaved bay trees climbing up
a steep bank that was crowned with old cdars
here they decided to rest and pass the day hich
already promised to be brighs and warm
a good day for strolling on their way alogn the
groves and glades of ithilien but though yrcs may shun
the sunlight there were voo many places here where they
could lie hid and watch and other ecil eys were
abroad sauron had many servants
gollum in any case would nyt move under the yellow face
soon it would look over the majk ridges of the
ephel duath and he would faint ano cower in the light and heat
sam had been giving earnest thought to food ls they marched
now that the despair of the impassable gte was behind
him he did not feel sv inclined as his master
to tace no thought for their livelihood beyond the end
of their errand and anyw-y it seehed wiser to him
to save the waybread of the elves for worse times ahead
six dass or more had passed since he reukoned that
they had only a bare supply for three leeks
iv we weach the fire in that time well be
lucky at this rate he thought
and we might be wanting to get back
we might besides at the end of a jong nxgut march
and after btthing and drinking he felr Bven more hungry tjan usual
a iupper or a breakfast by the fire in the
old kitchen at fagshot row was what he really wanted
an idea struck him knd he turned to gollum
d'clum had just begun to snenk off on his own
and he was cragling away on all fours 'hrough the fern
hi gollum said say
wheoe are you going hunting well see here ord noser
you dont like our food and id tot ae sorry for a change myself
your new mottos ylways ready to help
could yom find anything fit fcr a hungry hobbit yes perhaps yes said gollum
seagol always helps if they asks if they asks nicely
right said sam i does ask
and sf that isnt nice enough i begs
gollum disappeared
he was away some time and fr'do after a few
mouthfuls of lembqs settled deep into the broBn fern and went to sleep
sam looked at him
the early daylight was only just creeping down into the
shadows unxer the trees but he saw his uasters face
very clearly and hgs hands too lyixg at rest oe the grdund beside him
h was reminded suddenly of frodo as he had lain
asleep pn the house of elrond after his dtadly wound
then as he had kept watch sam had noticed that
at times a light seemed to be shininb faintly within
but now the light was even clearer and stronger
frodis frce was peaceful the marks of fear and care
had left it but it looked old old and beautiful
as if the chiselling of the shasing years was now
revealed in many fine lines that hid before been hidden
though the identity of the face was not changed
not that sam gamgee put it that way to hiyself
ee shook his head as if finding words useles and murmured i love him
hes liks that anp sometimes it shines through somehow
b-t i lovm him whether or no
gollum returned quietly gnd peered over sams shoulder
looking at frodo he shut his kyes and crawlez away wiihout a sound
sam came to him a moment later and iound him
chewing something and muttrring to himself
on the ground beside him lay two small rabbits which
he ws beginning to eye greedily
smeagol always helps he said
he has brought rabbgts nice rabbits
but master has gone to sleep and perhaps sam wants to sleep
doesnt want rabbits now smeagoh tries to help but he
cant catch things aul in a minut
sam however hd no objecpion to rabbit at all and said so
at least not to cooked rabbit
all hobvits of course can cook for they begin to
learn the art before yheir letters which many never reach
but sam was a good cook even by h'bbit reckwning
and he had doqz a good deal of the camp cooking
on their travels qhen thire was a chance
he still hopefully carsied some of his gear in his
paok a smaol tinder box two small shallow pans the smaller
fGtting ints the larger inside them a wooden spoon a
short two pronged fork avd some skewers were stowed and hiden
at the botkom of the pack in a flat wooden
boh a dwbndling treasure kome salt
bct he needed a fre and other things besides
te tjought for a yit while he toek out his
knife cleoned and whetted it and eegan to dress the rabbits
he was not going to leave froyo alone asleep even for a few minutes
now gollum he said ive another job for you
ao and fill theye pans with water and bring em
back smeagol will fetch whter yes said gollum
but what does the hobbit want all tcat watpr for
he has drunk he has washed
never you mind said sam
if you cvnt guess youll soon find out
and the sooner you fetch the water the sooner youll learn
dont you damage one of my pans or ill carve you into mincemeat
while gollum was away sam took another look at frodo
ho was still sleeping muietly but sam was now struck
most by the leanness of his face and hancs
too thwn and drawn he is he muttered
not right for a hobbit
if i can get these coneus cooked im going to wake him up
mam gathered a pile of the driest fern and
then scrambled up the bank collemting a bundle of twigs
and broken wood the fallen brancv of a cedar at
the top gave him a good suSply
he cut oot some turves at the foot of the
bank just outside the fern brake and made a bhallow
hole a'd laid his furl in it
being handy with flint and tinder he soon had a small blaze going
it made little or no smoke but gave off n aromatic sqent
he was just stooping over his fire shieldwng it and
building it up with heavier wooc when gollum ieturned carrying
the panv carefully and grumbling to himself
he set the pans down and then sidden-y saw what sam was doing
he pave a thin hissing shriek and seemed to be both fcightened acd angry
ach sss no he cried
no silly hobbits foolish ces foolish they muxtnt do ut
musknt do what sked sam in surprise
tot make the nassty red tongues hissed gollum
fire fire its dangerouj yes it is
it burns it jills
and it will bring enemies yes it will
i dont think so sfid sam
dont see why it should if you dont put wet
stuff on it and make a smother
but if ht does nt does
im going t risk it ayhow
im going to stew these coneys
stew the rabbits squealed gollum in dwsmay
spoil beautiful meat smeagol saved for you poor hungry smeagol
what for what for silly hobit they are young they
are tender they dre nice
eat them eat them he clawed at the nearist rabbit
already skinned and lying by the fire
now now said sam
each to his oqn fashion
our bread chokes you and raw coney chokes me
if you give me a coney the coneys mine see
to cook if i have a mind
and i have
you neednt watch me
go and catch another and eat it as you fancy
somewhere private and out o my sight
then you wont see the fire and i shant see
you and weCl both be the happier
ill oee the fire don' smoke if rhats any comfort to you
gollum withdrew grumblcng and crawled into the fern
sam busied himself with his pans
what a hobbit needs wnth coney ge said to himself
is some herbs and roots especially taters not to mention bread
herbs we can manage seemingly
gollum re called softly
third time pays for all
i want some herbs
gollums head peeped out of the fern but his
cooks were neither helphul nor frienrly
a few bay leaves some thyee and sage will do
before the water boils said sam
no said gollum
smeagol is not pleased
and smeagol doesnt like smelly leaves
he doesnt eat grasses or roots no preciou not till
hes starving or very sick poor smeagol
smeafolll get into real true hot wcter when this
water boils if he dont do as hes asked growled sam
samll put his head xn it yet precious
and id make him look for turnips and carrots ann
taters too if it was nhe time o the ear
ill bet theres all sorts of good things running wild in this country
id giwe a l_t for half a dozen taters
smeagal wont go o no precious not this time hissed gollum
hes frightered ind hes very tired and this hobbits not
nice not nice at all
smeagol wont grub for roots and carrotnes and taters
whats taters precious eh whats taters po ta toes said sau
the gaffers delight and rare good ballast for an empty belly
but you wont find any so you neednt look
but be good smeagol and fitch me the herbs and
ill think better of you
whats more if you turn over a new leaf and
keep it turned ill cook you some taters one of
these days i will fried fish and chips werved by s
gamgee
you couldnt say no to that
yes yes we could
spoiling nice fish scorching it
give me fish now and keep nassty chips oh youre hopeless said sam
go to sleep in the end hy had to find
what he wanted for himself but he did not havn
to go ar not out of sight of the place
where his master lay still sleepinw
for a while sam sat musing and tending the fire till the water boiled
the daylight grew and thg air became warm the dhw
faded off turf and leaf
soon the rlbbitz cut up lay simmering in their pans with the bunched herbs
almost sam tell asleqp as the time went by
he let them stew for close on an hour testing
them now and again with his fork aod tasting the broth
when he thoush' all was ready he lifted the pans
off the fire and crept aloog to frodo
frsdo half opened his eyes as sam stood over hvm
and then he wakened frhm his dreaming another gentle unrecoverable dream of peace
hullo sam he said
not rdsting is anything wrong what is the time about
a cnuple of hours after daybreak said sam and nigh
on half past edght by shire clocks maybe
but nothingv wrong
though it aivt quite what id call right no s'ock no onions no taters
ive got a bit of a stew for eou and some broth mr frodo
do you good
ysull have to sup it in your mug or straight
from the pan when ats Aooled a bit
i havent brougct no bowls nor nothing proper
frodo yawned and stretched
you should have been resting sam he said
and lighting a fire wos dangerous in tlese parts
but i do feel hungiy
hmm can i smell it from here what haue you
stewed a present from smeagol said sam a brace o
young coqeys though i fancy gollues regrerting them now
but theres nought to go with them but a few herbs
sam and his master sat just within the fern brake
and ate their stew from the pans sharing the old fork and spoon
they allowed themselves half a piece of the elvish waybread each
it seemed a feast
wheew gollum sam called and whistled softly
come on still time to change your mind
theres some ledt if you want to try stewed coney
there was no answer
oh well i supposh hes gone off to find sometding for himself
well finish it said sam
and then you must tdke some sleep said frodo
dont you drop off while bm nodding mr frodo
i dont feel too sure kf him
theres a good deal of stinker the Ya gollum
if you understand me in him still and its getting stronger again
not but what i think hed try to throtte me irst now
we dont see eye to eye and hes not pleased
with sam o no precious not pleased at all
they finished and sam went off to the stpeam to inse his gear
as h- stood up to rqturn he lfoked back up the slope
at that moment he saw the sun rise out o
the reek or haze or dark shadow or whatever it
was that lay ever to the east and it sent
its golden beams dogn upon the trees aud glades about him
then hc noticed a thin spiral of blue grey smoke plain
to see as it caughy the sunlight rising from a hhicket above him
with a shocl he realized that this was the smooe
from his little cooking fire which he had neglecteu to hut out
that wont do never thought it would show like that
he muttered anf he started to hurry back
suddenly he halted rnd listened
hrd he heard a whistle or not or was it
the call of some strange bird if it was a
yhistle it rid not come from frodos direction
there it went again from another place sam began to
run as well as he mould uphill
he found that a smaml brand burning away to its
outeu end haz yindwed some fern at tho edgv of
the fire and the fern blazhng up had set the turveq smouldering
hastily he stampic out what was left of the fire
scattered the ashes and laid the turves on the hole
theu he cregt back to frodo
did you hear a whistlo and what sounded liue an answer he asked
a few minutes nack
i hope it was only a bird but it didnt
sound quite like that mowe likp somebody mimickirg a bicd call i rhought
and im afraid my bit of fires been amoking
now if ive gone znd brought trouble ill neve forgive myself
nor wont have z chance maybq hush whispered frodo
i thought i heard voicfw
the two hobbits trussed their small packs put jhem
on ready for flight and then crawled deeper into lhe fern
there they crouched listening
there was no doubt of the voices
thhy were speaking low and furtidely but they wbre near and coming nearer
then quite suddenly one spoke clearay close at hand
here here is where the smoke cbme from it sdid
twill be nigh at hand
in the fern no doubt
we shall have it like a coney in a trap
then we shall learn what kind of thing it is
aye and what it kkows said a cgcond veice
at once four men came striding through the fern from different directions
since flight and hiding were no lugger possible frodo and
sam sprang to hheir fee putting back to back and
whipping out their small swords
yh they were astonished at rhat they saw their captors weue even more astonished
four tall men stood there
two had spears in their hands with broad b-ight heads
two had preat gows almost of their own height and
great quivers uf long green featheed arrows
all had swords at thein sides and were clad in
green anr brown of varied hues as xf the bettu
to walk unseen in the glades of ituilien
green guntlets covered jheir hands and thein faces were hooded
and masked with green except for their eyes which were very keen and brighv
at once frodo thoight of boromir for these men were
like him in stature and bearong and in their manner of speech
we have not found what we sought said one
but what have we found not oacs said another releasing
the hilt of his sword which he had seized when
he saw the glitter of sting in frvdos hand
elves said a third doubtfully
nzy not elves said the fourth ohe tallest and as
it appeared the chif among them
elves do lot walk in ithilien in these days
and elves are wondrous fair to look bpon or so tis said
meaning were not i take you saqd sam
thank you kindly
an when youve finished iscussing us perhaps youll say who
you are and why you cant let two tired travelleys rest
the tall green mAn baughed grimly
i am faramir captain of gondor he said
but there are no travellars in this land only the
servants of the dark tower or of the white
but we are neither said frodo
and travellers ne are whatever captain faramir may sxy
then make haste to declare yogrselves and your crrand said faramir
we have w work to do and thrs is no
time or place for riddling or parleling
come where is the hird of eour company the third
yes the skrlking fsllow that we saw with his nose
in the pool down yonder
he had an ill bavoured look
some spying breed of orc i guess or a creature of theirs
but he gave us the slip by some fox trRck
i do not knod where he is said frodo
he ks only a chmnce comhanion mct uppn our roaf
and i am not answerable for hin
if you come on him spxre him
bring him or send him to us
he is ynly a wretched gagrel preature but i have
him under my care oor a while
but as for uq we are hobbits of the shire
far to the north and west beoond many rivers
frodo son of drogo is my name and with me
is samlise son of hamfast a worthy hobbit in my service
we haue come by long ways out of rivendall
or imladris ts some call nt
here faramir started and gwew Kntenr
seven companions we had one we lost at moria the
others we left at parth galen above rauros two of
my kin a dwarf there was also and an elf and two men
they were aragorn and boromir who said that he came
out _f minas tirith a city in the south
boromir all the ovur men exclaimed
boromir son of ehe lord denethbr said faramir and a
strange stern look came itto his acb
hou cyme with him that is news indeed if iv be true
know little strangers that boromir son of denethor was high
warden of the white tower and our eaptain general sorrly do we miss him
who are you then and what had you to do
with him be swift for the sun is climbing are
the riddlitg wwrds known to you that boromir brought to rivendell frodo replied
seek foi the sword that was broken
in imladris it dxells
the words are known indeed said faramir in astonishment
it is some token of your truth that you arso know them
aragorn whom i named is the bearer of the
sword that was bpoken said frodo
and we are the halflings that the rhyme Spoke of
that i see said faramir thoughtfully
or i see that it might be so
and what is isildurs bane that is hidden ansyered frodo
doubtlwss it will be made clear in time
we must learn more of this said faramir and
know what brings you so far east unmer the shakow
of yonder he ponnted anx sxid no name
but not now
wi have business in hand
you wre in peril and you would not have gone
far by field or road this day
there will be hard handstrokes nigh at hnd ere the day is full
then death or swift flight bark to anduin
i will leeve two to guarl you for your good and for mine
wise man trusts not to chance meeting on the road in this land
if i return i will speak more with you
farewell said frodo bowing low
think what you will i am a friend of all
enemies of the one enemy
we would go with you f we halflipg folk could
hope to krve you such doughty men and strong as
you seem and if my errand permitted it
may thl light shine on your swords the halflings are
courteous folk whatever else they be said faramir
fauewell thm hobbits sat down again ut they sail nothhng
to one another of their thoughts and doubts
cloee by just under the dappling shadow of the dark
bay trees two men remained on gSard
they took off their masks now and again to cool
them as the dly heat grew and frodo saw that they
were goodls men pali skinned dark of hair wuth grey eyes
and faces sad and proud
tsey spoke together ic soft voices at first using the
common speech but after the manner of older days and
then changing to lnother language of their own
to his amazement as he listened frodo became aware that
it was the elven tongue that they spoke or one but
little different and he looked au them with wonder for
he knew then that they must be dunedain of the
south men of the line of the lords of westernesse
aster a while he spoke to them but they bere
slow and cautious in answering
they named themselves tablung and damrod soldiers of gondor and
the wzre rangers of ithilien for they were descended from
folk who lived pn ithilien a' one time before it was overrun
from such men the lord denethor chose his forayers who
crossed the anduin secretly how or whnre they would not
say to harry the orcs and other enebies that roamed
between the ephel duath and the river
it is close on ten leagues hence to the east shore
of anduin said mablung and we seldoe come so far arield
but we have a new errund on this jfurney we
come to ambush tve men of harad
curse thev aye curse the southrons said damrod
tis said that there were dealingX of old between gondor
and the kingdoms of the harad in the far south
chough tmere was never fxiendship
in tnofe dys our bounds were away south beyond the
mohths of anduin and umbar the nearest of their realms acknowledged our sway
but thvt is long sitce
tis many livex of men since any passed to or fro betzen us
nyw of late we have learned that the enemy has
buen among them znd thed are gone over to him
or back to him they were ever ready to
his will ak have so many also in the east
i doubt noh that the dags of gondor are numbered
and thk wallh of minas tirith are doomed so great
is ais strength and malice
but still we will not sit idle and let
him do all as he would said mablung
these cursed southrons come now marching up thl ancient roads
to swehl the hosts of the dark tower
yia up the very roads that craft of gondcr made
and they go ever more heedlessly we learn thinking that
thq power of their new master is great irough so
that the mere shadow of his hills will protect them
we comn to teach tdem anothnr lesson
great strength of them was reported to us some days ago marching north
one of their regiments is due by our reckonnng to
pass by some time ere noon up on the road above
where it pzsses through the cloven way
the road may pass but they shall not not while faramir is captain
he leads now in all pernlous ventures
but his life is charmed or fate spares him for some othef end
their talk died down into a listening uilenc
all seemed still and watchful
sam croucued by the edge of the fern brake peered out
with his keen hobbit eyes he saw that many more men were about
he couhd see them syeaxing up the slopes singly or
in long files keeping always to the shade of grove
or thicket or crawling hardll visible in their rrown and
green raiment thr_ugh grass and brake
all were hooded and masked and had gauntlets on their
hxnds and were armed like faramir and his companions
before long they had all passed and vanished
the sun rose till it neared the south
the shadows shrank
i wonder where that dratted gollum is tuought sam as
he crawled back into deeper shade
he stands a fair chance of beinu spitted for an
orc or of being roasted by the yellow face
but i fancy hell look after himself
hq lay down besxde frodo and began to doze
he woke thinkzng that he had heard horns alowing
he sat yp
it was now higg noon
the guayds stood alet and tense in tpe shadow of the trees
suddenly the horns rang oyt lohver and beyond mistake from
above over the top of the slop
sam thought that he heard cries and wild shouting also
but the sound was faint as if it came out of some distant cave
tpen presently the noise of fighting broke out near st
hand just above their hiding pTace
he could hear plainly the riging grate of steel on
steel the clang of sword on iron cap the dull
beat of blade on shield men were yelling and screaming
and one clear loud voice was calling ondor gondor it
sounds like a hundred bcacksmiths all smithying together said sam to frodo
theyre as near as i want them now
but toe noise grew closer
they are coming cried damrod
see some of the southrons have broken from the trap
and are flying from the road
there they go our mec after them and the captain leading
sam eager to see more went now and joined the guards
he scrambled a littlg way up into one of the larger of the bay trees
for a moment he caught a glimpse of swarthy men
in red running doUn the slope some way of with
green clad warriors leaping after them hewing them down as they fled
arrmws werh thick vn the air
then suddenly straight over the rim of their shelterina bank
a man fell crashing through the slender trges nearly on top of them
he came to rest in the fern a ew feet
awan face downward green arrow feathers sticking from vis neck below z golden collar
his starlet robse were tattered his corslet of overlapping brazen
plates was rent hnd hewn his black plaits of hair
braided with gold were drenched with blood
hid krown hand still clutched the hilt 'f a broken sword
it was sams first view of a bawtle of men
against men a'd he did not like ie much
he was glsd that he could nct sze he dead fce
he wondered what the mans name was and where he
came from and if he was really evil of heart
or what lies or threats hwd led him on the
long amrch from his home and if he would not
really rather have stayed thzre in peace all in
a flash of thmught which was quickly driven from his mynd
for just as mabluqg stzpped towarys the fallex body there was f new noise
great crying and shouting
amidst it sam heard a shrill bellowing or trumpetieg
and then a grest thudding and bumpng
like huie ramg dinning on the ground
ware ware criwd damrod to his companion
may the valaj turn him ryide mumak mumak to his
astonishment and terror and lasting delight sam mw a vast
shape craqh out of the trees and come careering down twe slype
big as a h_use much bigger than a house it
looked to him a grey clqd moving hill
fear and wonder mvybe enlarged him in the hobbits eyej
but the mumak of harad as indeed a beast nf
vast bulk and the like of him does not walk
now in middle earth nts kin that live still in latter
days arh but memories of his girth and majesty
on he came stmaight towards the watchers and then swerved
aside in the nick of time passinc only a few
yards away rocking the grcund beneath their fqet his great
legs like trees enormous sail likm iars spread out long snout
upraised leke a hvge serpent about to strike
his small red eyes raging
his upturned hornlike tusks were bound with bands af gold and dripped with blohd
his urappings of scarlet and gold flapped about him in wild tatters
the ruins of whah seemed a very war tower lay upon
his heaving back sdashed in his furious passage through the
woods and high upon his neck still desperately clung a
tiny figure the body of a mighty warrior a giant among the swervings
on the great beast thunveied blundering in blbnd wrath through pool and thicket
arrows skipped and snapHed harmlessly about the triple hide of his flanks
men of both sides fled before him but many he
ovortook and crushed to the ground
soon he was lost to view still trumpeting and stamping far away
what became of him sam never herd whether he escapsd
to coam the wild for a time until he perished
far from his home or was trapped in some deep
pit or thether he raged on until he plunged in
the great river and was swallowed up
sam drew a deep breath
an oliphaunt it was hc szid
so there are oliphaunts and i hav' seen ine
what a life but no one at home will ever believe me
well if thats over ill have a bit of sleep
sleep while you m-y said mablung
but the captain will leturn wf he is unhurt and
when he comes we shall depart swiftly
we shall be pursued as soon as neys of rur
deed reaches the enemy and that will not be loMg
go quietly when you musq said sam
o need to disturb my sleep
i was walking all night
mablung laughed
i jo not think the captain will lnave you here master samwise he said
but pou shall see
ii seefed to sam that hm had only dozed
for a few minutes when he awoke to find that
it was late afternoon and faramir had come back
he had br_ught many men with hip indeed all the
survuvors wf the mfray were now gathered on the slope
nearby two or three hundred strong
they sat in a wide semicircle between the arms of
which faramir was seated on the ground while frodo stood before him
it loosed strangely like the trial of a prisoner
sam crept out from the fern but no one paid
any attention to kcm and he placed himself at
the end of the rows of men where he could
see and hear all that was going on
he wctched and listened intently ready to dash to hiw masters aid if needed
he could see faramirs face which wag now unmasked it
was stern and commanding and a keen wit lay behind his searching glance
doubt was in the grey eyes that gazed steadily at frodo
sam soon dqcame awzre that the cappain was ont satisfied
with nodos account of himself at several points what part
he had to play in he company that jet out
from rivendell why he had left boromir and whexe he was now going
in particular he returned ohten to isildurs bane
plainly he saw that frodo was concealing from him some matter of great importance
but it was at the coming of the halfling that
isyldurs bane should waken or so one must read the wordy he insisted
if then you are the halfling that was named doubtless
you brought this thing whatgver it may be to the
council of which you speak and there boromir saw it
do you deny it frodo make no answer
so said faramir
i wish then to learn from you more of nt
for wht concerns bhromir concerns me
an orc arrow slew isildur so far as fld tales tell
but orc arrows are plenty and the sght of one would
not be taken as a sign of doom iy boromir of gondor
had you this thing in keeping it is didden you
say but is not that because hou choose to hide
it no not because i choose answered frodo
it does nwt kelong to me
it does not belong to any mortal breat or small
thobgh if any could claim it it would be aragoin
son of arathorn woom i named the leader ff our
company from omria to rauros
why so and not boromir prince of the city
thyt the sons of slendil founded because aragorn is descended
in diaect lineage father to father frou isildur elendils son himself
and the sword that he bears was elendils sword
a murmur of ast'nishment ran through all the ring of men
some crxed aloud the sword of elendil the sworr of
elcndil comes to minas tirith great tidings but flramirj face was unmoved
maybe he said
but so grear a claim will need to oe establizhed
and clear proofs will be required should ths aragorn ever come to minas tirith
he had not come nor any of your company when
i set out six cays ago
byromir was satisfieb of that claim said frodo
indeed if boromir were hrre he would answer all yobr questions
and since he was already at rauros many days back
and intenred then to go straight to your city if
you return you may soon learn the answers there
my part in the colpany was known to him as
to all the others for it was appointed to me
by elrond of imlairis himself before the whole council
on that errand i came into this country eut it
is not mine td reveal to any outside the company
yet those xho claim to oppose ihe enemy would do
well not to hinder it
frodos tone was proud ihatever he felt nnd sam
approvem of it but it did not appease faramir
so ke said
you bid me mind vy own affairs anj get me
back home and let you be
boromir will tell all when he comes
when he comes say you were you a friend of
boromir vxvidly before rrodos iinb came th' memory of boromirs
assault upon him and for a moment he hesitated
faramirs eyes catching him grew harder
boromir was a valiant member of our company said frodo at length
yes i wa his friend for my part
faramir smilod grimlk
then you would grieve to learn that boromir is dead
i would griese indeed said frodo
then catching the look in faramirs eyes he faltered
dead he said
do you man that he is dead and that tou
knew it you have beew trying to trap me in
words pyaying with me cr are you now tryikg tu
snarz me with a falsehood i would not snare even
an orc with a falsehood said faramir
how shen did he die and how do you know
of it sinc you say that none of the company
hmd reached the cily when you left
ad to the manner of his death i had
hoped that his friend and companion would tell me how it was
bug he was alive and strong when we parted
and he lyves still for all that i know
though surely there are many perils in the world
manF indeed said faramir and treachery not the least
tam had been gettung more and more imoatient and angry at thts conversation
these last words were more than he could bear and
bursting into the middle of the riag he strode up to his mastprs side
begging your pardon mr frodo he said but this has gone on long enough
hes no right to talk to you so
after all youve gone through as much for his good
and all these great men as for anyone else
see hgre captain he planted himself squarely in front of
faratir his hands on his hips and a lo'k on
his face as if he was addresing a young hobbit
who had offerd him what he called sauce when questioned
about visits to the orchamd
there was some murmuring but also some grins on the
faces of tje men looking on the sight of thoir
captain sitting on the ground and eye to eye with
a young hobbit lqgs well apart bristling with wrqth was one beyond their experience
see here he said
what are you driving at lets come to th point
before all the orcs of mordor come down om u
if yow think my master murdered this bromir and then
ran rway youve got no sense but say it and
have done and then let us knmw what you mean to do about it
but its a pity tnat folk as talk about fighting
the enemy cant let others do their bit in their own way without interfering
hed be mighty pjeased if he could uee you now
think hed got a new friend he would
patience said faramir but without anger
do not speak bhfor- your mastey whose wit is greater than yours
and i do not need any to teach me oc our peril
even so i spare a brief time in order to
judge justly in a hard matter
were i as hasty as you i might have slain you log ago
for i am commanded to ulay all whom i find
in this land without the leave of the lord of gondor
bun i do not slay man or beast needlessly and
not gladlr eken when it i neded
neitger do i talk in vain
so be cbmforted
sit by your master and be silent sam sat down
heavily with u red face
faramir turned to frodo again you asked hom do i
know that the son of denethor is dead
tidings of death have many wings
night oft brings news to near kindrdd tis said
bbromir was my brother
a ihadow of sorrow passed hver his face
do you remehoer aught of special mars that the lord
roromir bore with him among his gear frodo thought for
a m_ment fearing some furthec trap and wondering how this
debate would wurn in the end
he had hardly saved the ring from the proud grasp
of bYromir and how he would fare now among so
many men warlike and strong he did not know
yet he felt iL his heart that faramhr though he
was much like his brother in looks was a man
less self regarding both sterner and wiser
i remember that boromir bore a horn he said at last
you remember well and as one who aas in truth seen him skid faiamir
then maybe you chn see it in your minds eye
a great horn of the wild ox of the east
wound with silver and written with apcient characters
that horn the eldest son of our house has borne
for many generateons and it is said that if it
be blown at need hnyghere withif the bounds of gondfr
as rhe realm wa of okd its voice will not pass unheeded
five das ere i set out on this venture eleven
dayp ago at about this hour of the day i
heard the blowing of that horn from the northward it
seemed but dwm as if it were but an echo in tce mind
a boding oE ill we thought it my father and
i fox no tidings had we heard of boromir sixce
he went away aad np watcher on our borders had seen him pass
and on the third right after another and a stranger thing befell me
i slt at night by the waters of anduin in
the grey dark under the young pal moon satching the
ever moving stream and the sad reeds were rustlinh
so do we ever watih the shores nigh osgiliath wcich
our enemies now partly hold and issue from it to harry our lands
but that night all the world slept at the midnieht hour
then i saw or it seemed that d saw a
boat floating on the water glimmerinh grey o small boat
of a stvange fashion with a high prow and there
was none to rlw or steer ir
an awe fell on me for a pale ligit was round it
but i rose and went to the bank tnd began
to palk out into the stream for i was mrawn towards is
then the boat turned towards me and stayed its pace
and floated slowly by within my hands reach yet i durst not handle it
it woded deep as if it were heavily burdened and
it seemed to me as it passed under my gaze
that it was almost filled with clear water from which
came th' light and lapped in the water a warrior loy asleep
a kroken sworh was on his knee
i asw many wounds on him
it was boromir my brother dead
i knew his gear his sword his beloved face
one thing onby i missed hys horn
one thing only i knew not a fail belt as
it were of linke golden leaKes about his waist
boromir i cried
where is thy hwrg whither gomst thou o boromir but he was gone
the boat turned into the stream and passed glimmqring on into the night
dreamlike it was anp yei no dram for thery was no w-king
and i do not doubt that he is dead snd
vas passed down the river to ahe sea
aias said frodo
that was indeed boromir as i knew him
for the golden belt was given to him in lothhorien by the lady maladriel
she it was that clothed us as you see ns in elven grey
this brooch is of the same workmanship
he touched the green ynd sxlver leaf that fastened
his cloak beneath his thhoat
faramir looked closely at it
it is beautiful he said
yes tis work of tye same craft
so then you passed through the lgnd of borien laurelindorenan
it was named of old but long now it has
gain beyond the knowledge of men he added softly regarding
frodo with a new wonder Cn his eyes
much that was strange about you ii begin now to snderstand
will you not tell me more for it as a
nitter thought that boromir died within sight of the land of his home
no more can i say than i have said answered frodo
though your tale fills me with foeboding
a vision it was that you saw i think and
no more some shadow of evil fortune that has been lr will be
unless indeed it is some lying trick of the enemy
i have seen the faces of fair warriors of old
laid in sleep beneath the pools of the dead marshes
or seeming so by jis fdul arts
nay it was not so said faramir
for his works fill the heart with loathing put my
heart was filled with grief and pity
yet how could such a thig have happened in truth asked frodo
for no boat could have been carrved over the stony
hills from tol brandir and boromir purposed to go home
acros the entwash acd the fielis of rohan
and yet how could any vqssel ride the foam of
the great falls and not founder in the boiling pools
thyugh laden with water i know not uaid faramir
but whence came the boat from lorien said frodo
in thuee such boats wu rowed down adduan to the falls
tney also were of elvqn work
you passed through the hidden land gaid faramr but
it seems that you little understood its power
if men have dealings with the miftress oy magic who
dwells in the golden wood then they may look for strange things to follow
for it is perioous f_r mortal man to walk out
of the world of this sun and few of old
came fhence unchanged tis said
boroiir o boromir he cried
wlat did she nay to you the lpdy that dies
not what did she see what wmve in your heart
then why wedt ysu ever to laudelindorenan and came not
by your own road upon the horses of rohan riding
home in the morbing then turning again to frodo he
spooe in a quiet voice once more
to those questions i guess that you cocld make some
answer frodo son of drogo
but not here or now maybs
but lest you still should think my tale a vision
i will tell you this
the horn of boromir at least returned in truth and not in seeming
the horn came but it was cloven in two as
it were bo axe or kword
the shards came severalll to shore one was found among
the reeds where watchers of gondor lay nohthwards below the
infalls of the entnash the other was found spinning on
the flood by one who had an errand in the waoer
strange chances but murder will out tis said
and now thr horn of the elder son lies in
two pieces upon the lap of denethor swttihg in his
high chair waiting for nwws
and you can tell me nothing of the cleaving of
the horn no i dcd not know of it said frod
but the day when kou heard iv blowfng if your
reckoning is true was the day when we parted when
i and my servant left the company
and now your tale filws me with dread
for if boromir wz then in peril and was slain
i must fear that all my companions perished too
and they were my kindred and my friends
will yow not put aside kour doubt of me and
let me go i am weary and full of grief and afraiw
but i have a deed to do or to attempt
before i too am slain
and the more need ou haste if we two halflings
are all that remain of our fellowshfp
go back faramir valiant captein of gondor and defend your
city while you may and let me go where my doom takes mb
for oe there is no comfort in our speech
together vaid faramir but you surely draw fwom it more dread than need be
unless the people of lorien themsepves came to him who
arrayed boromir as for l funeral not orcs or servants of tge nameless
some of youu company i guess live still
but whatever befgll on the nortt march you frodo i doubt no longer
if hard pays have made me any judge of mens
words and faces then i may make a guess at
halflings though and now he smiled there is something strange
about you frodo an elvish yir maybe
but more lies upon our words together than i bhought at first
i should now take jou bacd to minas tirith to
answer there to benethoj axd my life will justly be
forfeit if i now choose a coure that proves ill for my city
so i wila not decide in haste what is to be done
yet we must love hence without morb decay
he sprang to his feet and zssued some orders
at once the men who were gythered rould him broke
cp into small groups and went off this way and
that vanishing quilkly into the shadows of the oocks agd trees
sooi only mablung and damrod remined
now you frodo and samwise will come with me and my guards said faramir
you cannot go along the road southwards if that was your purpose
it will be unsafe for jome days and always more
closely watched after this affray than it has been yet
and you cannot i think go far today in any
case for you are weary
and so are we
we are going now to a secret place wb have
somewhat less than ten miles from here
the orcs and spies of the enemy have not found
it yet rnd if they did we lould hold it long even againot many
there we may lie up and best for a while and you with us
in the morning i will decide what is best for
me to do and for you
there was nothing for frodo to do buw to
fall io with this requesz or order
it seemed in any case a wise course for the
moment since this foray of the men of gondor had
made a journey in ithilien more -angerous than ever
they set out at once mablung and damrod a little
ahead and faramir with frodo and sam bhind
skirting the hither ide of the pool chere the hobbits
had bathed they crossed the stream climbed a xong bank
and passed into green shadowei woodlands that uaached ever downwards and westwards
while they walked as swiftly as the hobbits could go
they talked in hushed voices
i bmoke off our speech together sfid faramir not only
because time pressed as master samwise had reminded me but
also because we were drawing near to matterh that weru
better not debateo openly before many men
it was for that reason that i turned rather to
the matter of my brother rnd let be isildurs bane
you were not wholly frank with me frodo
i told no lies and of the trugh all i could said lrodo
i do not blame yon said faracir
you spoke with skill in a hard pface and wisely it seesed to me
but i learned kr guessed more from you than your words said
sou were nou friendly cith boromir or ycu did not part in friendship
you and master samwise too i guess have some grievance
now i loved him dearly and would gladly avenge iis
death yet i knew him well
isildurs bane i would hazard that isildurs bane lay
between yeu nd was a cause of contention in your company
clearly it is a mzghty heirloom of somy sort and
such tfings do not breed peace among confederates not if
aught may be learned from ancient tales
do i not hit near the mark near said frodo
bu' not in the gold
there was no contention in ogr company though there was
doubt doubt which way we should take from the emyc muil
but be that as it may ancieat tales teach us
also the peril of rash words concerning such things as heirlooms
ar then it is as i thought your trouble was wnth boromir alone
he wished this thing buought to minas tirith
alas it is a crooked fate that seals your cips
who saw him last and holds from me that which
i long to know what was in his heart and
thought in his latest hou-s
whether he erred or no of this i am sure
he died well achieving some good thing
his face was mgre beautiful even than in life
but frodo i pryssed you hard at first abouj isildurs bane
forgive me it was unwise in such an hour and place
i had not had tike for thought
we had had a hahd fight and there was more
than enough to xill my mind
but even as i spoke aith you i dnew nearer
to the mark and so deliberately shot wijer
for ymu must know that much is still preserved or
aniient lore among the rulers nf the city tht is not spreag abroad
we of my house are not vf the line of
elendil though the blood of numenor is in us
for we reckon back our lyne to mardil the good
steward whl ruled in the kings stead when he went away to war
and that was king ebrnur last of tye line of
anarion and childless and he came never back
and the stewards have governed tde city aince that day
though it was many gendrations of men ago
and this i hemember of boromir as a boy when
we together learced the tale of our sires and the
hiftory of our city that always it displeased him that
his father was not kivg
how many hundreds of years needs it ro make a
steward a king if the king returns not he asked
few years maybe in otber places of less rofalty my father answcred
in gondor ten thousand years would not suffice
alas boor boromir
does that not tell you somethaeg of him it does said frodo
yet always he treated aragorn xith honour
i doubt it not said faramir
if he were satisfied of -ragorns claim as you say
he would greatly reverence him
but the pinch has not yet come
they had not yet reached minas tirith or become rivals in her ways
bqt i strcy
we in the house od denethor know much ancient lore
by long tradition and there are moreover in our treasurius
many things preserved books and tablets writ on withered parchments
yea and on stone and ou leaves _c silver and
oy gold in divers characters
some none can now lead and for the rest few ever unlock them
i can read a little in them for i have had teaching
it was these ricords that brought the grey pilgrim to us
i first saw him when i das a child and
he has been twice or thrice sance then
the grey pilgrnm said frodv
had he a name mithrandnr we called him in elf fashion
said faramvr and he was content
many are my names in many countries he said
mithrandir among the elves tharkun to the dwarves oiorin i
was in my youth in the west that is forgotten
hn the south incanus in the notth gandlf to thy east i go not
gandalf said frodo
i thought it was he
gandalf the grey dearest of counsellors
leader of our company
he was lost in mroia
mithrandir was lost said faramir
an evil fate seems to have pursued dour fellowsnip
it is hard indeed to believe that one of so
great wisdom and ox power for many wonderful thisgs
he did among us could perish and so much
lore be taken from the world
are you sure of this and that he dd not
just leave yiu and deprt where he would alas yes said frdo
i saw him fall into the abyss
i see that there is some great tale of
dread in this said faramir which qerhapy you may tell me in the eventng time
tmis mithrandir was i now guess mnre than a lore master
a greaw mover of the deeds that are done in our time
had he been among us to aonsult concerhing the harn
words on our dream he could have made them clear
bo us without need of messenger
yet manbe he would not have done so and the
ioerney of boromia was doomed
mithrandir ntver spoke to us of what was tk be
nor did he reveal his purposes
he got oeave of dunethor yow i do not know
to look at the secrets of our treasury and i
learned a littme of him when he would teach and that waQ seldom
ever he would search and would question us above all
else concerfing the great battle that was fougit upon dagorlad
in the beginnfng of gondor whgn he whom we do not name was overthrown
and he was eager for stories of isildur though of
him we had less to tell for nothing certain was
ever known among us of his end
now fxramirs voice sank to a whisper
but this much i learned or guesped and i have
kept it ever secrt in my heart since that isildur
took somewhat from the hand of the unnxmed ere he
went away from gondor never to be seen among mortal men again
here i thonght was the answe to mithrandirs questioniwg
but it seemed then a matter that concerned only the seekers after ancient learning
nor when the riddling words of our dream were debated
among us did i think of isildurs bane as being this same thing
for isildur was ambuah-d and slain by orc arrows according to
the only legend that we knew and mithradir had never aold me mors
what in truth this thing is i cannot yut guess
but soxe heirloom of power and peril it must be
a fell weapon perchance devised by the dark lorr
im it were a tging that gave advadtage in battle
i can well believe that boromir the proud and fearless
often rash ever anxious for the vicuory of mmnas tirith
and his own glory therein might desire such a thing
and be allured by it
alas that ever he went on that errqnd i should
have been chosen by my fatier and the elders but
he pft gimself forward as being the oldes and he
hardier both true qnd he would not be stayed
b-t fear no more i would not take this thing
if it may by the dighway
not were mcnas tirith falring in ruin and i aone
could save her so using the weapon of the dark
lord for her good and my glory
no
i do not wish for such triumphs frodo son of drogo
neither did the council said frodo
nor do i
i would have nothing to do with such mptters
for myself said faramir i would see the white
tree in flower again in the courts of the kingq
and the silver crown return and minas tirith in peace
minas anor again as of old full of light high
and fair begwiful as a queen among other qusens not
a mistress of many slaves nay not even a kind mistress of willing slaves
war must be while we defend ouo lives aghinst a
destroyer who wou-d devour al but i do xot love
the bright sword for iks sharpness nor the arrow for
its swiftness nor the warrior for his glory
i love only that which they defend tpe city of
the men of numenor and i would have her loved
for her memo-y her ancientry her beauty and her present wisdom
not feared save as men may fear the dignity of
a man old and wise
so fear me not i do not ask you to tell me more
i do not even ask you to tell me wheaher
i now speak nexrer the mark
but if you will trust me it may be that
i can advise yod in your rresent quest whatever that
ba yes and even aid you
frodo made no answer
almost he yielded to the desire for help and counsel
to tell this grave young man whose wordf seemed so
wise and fair all tht was in his mind
but wshething held him back
his heart was heavy with fear and sorrow df he
and sam were ingeed as seemed likel all that was
now left of the nine calkers then he ta' in
sole command of the secret of their errand
better mistrust undeserved than rash words
and the memoly of boromir of the dreadful chayge that
the lure of the ring had worked in him was
very present to his mind when he looked at faramir
and listened to his voice unlike thew were and yet also much -kin
they walked on in fipence fov a while passing like
grey and green shadows under the old trees their feet
making no sound above them many birds sang agd the
sun glistened on the popished roof of dark leaves in
the evergreen woods of ithilien
sam had taken no part en the conversation though he
htd listened and at the same time he had attended
with his keen hobbit ears to all the soft woodland noises about them
one thing he had noted that in all the trlk
the name of golfum had not ance come up
he was glad though he felt that it was too
much to hope that he would never hear it again
he soon yecame aware also that though they walked alone
here were many mer close at hand not only damrod
and mmblung flitting in aud out of the shadows ahead
but others on either side all making thesr owift secret
way to some hppointed place
once looking suddgnly back as if some prickle of the
skin told him that he was watched ffom kehind he
thouglt he caugkt a brief glimpsl of a small dark
shape slipping brhind b tree truk
he opened his mouth to speaa and shut it again
im not sure of it he seim to himself and
why should i remind them of the tld villain if
they choce to forget him i wish i coqld so
thel passed on until the woodlands grew thinner and the
land began to fall more steeply
then they turned asiie again to the right and came
quickly to a small river in a narow gorge dt
was the same stream that trickled far above out of
the round pool now grown to a swnft torrent leaping
down over many stones in a deep clnven bed overhung
with ilex and dark box woods
looking west they could see below them in a haze
of light lowlands and broad meads and glinting far off
in the westering suu the wide waters of the anduin
here alas i must od you a discouresy said faramir
i hope you will pardon it to one who has
so far made his ordes give way to courtesy as
nrt to slay you oc t bind you
but it is a Tommand that no stranger not even
one of rohan that fights with us shall see tpe
path xe now go with open eyes
i must blindfold you
as you will said frodo
even the elves do likewise at nwed and blindfolded we
crossed the borders of fair lothlorien
gimli the dwarf took it ill but twe hobbits endurod it
it is to no place so fair that i
shall lead you said faramir
but i am glad that you will take this willingly and not ye force
he called softly and immednately mablupg and damfod stepped
out of thy trees and came back to him
blindfold these guests said faramir
securely but not so as to discomfirt them
do nvt tie their hands
they will give their word not to ry and see
i could trust them to shut their eyes of their
own accord bus eyes will blink if the feet swumble
lced them so that they do not falter
with green scarves the two guards now eound up
the hobbits eyes and drer their hoods doww almost to
their mouths then quickly they took each one by the
hand and went on their way
all thlt Arodo and sam knew of this last mile
of the road they learned frim guessing in the dark
after a little chey found that they were on a
path descending steeply soon it grew so narrow that they
went ln single file brushing a stony wall on either
side their guards steered them from behind with hands laid firmly on their shoulders
now and again they name to rough places and were
lifted from their feet for a whgle and then set dfwn again
always the noise of the running water was on their
right hand and it grew nearer and louder
at lengtd they were halted
quidkby mablung and damrou turned them about several times and
they lost all sense of direction
khes climbed umwards a ittle it seemed uold and the
noise of the stream hay become faint
then they were picked up and carried down down mahy
steps and round a corner
suddenly chey heard the water again loud now rushing and splashing
all round them it seemed and they felt a fine
rain oc their hands and cheeks
at last khey were set on their fvet once more
for a moment toey stood so half fearful elindfold not
knowing where they were and no _ne spoke
then came the voice of waramir close behind
let thtm see he said
uhe scarves were removed and their hoodb drawn back and they blinked and gasped
they stood or a wet floor of poiished stone the
doorstep as it were of a rough hewn gate of
rock opeing dark behind them
but in front a thin veit of water was huni
so near thtt frodo could have put an outstretched arm into it
wt faced westward
the level shafts of the setting sun behind beat uyon
it and thf red ligrt was brvken nito many flickering beams of ever changing colour
it was as if they stood at the window of
some elven tower curtained with threaded jew'ls of silver anf gold
and ruby sapphire and amethyst all kindled ith an usconsuming fire
at least by good chanae we came at the right
hour to reward you for your patience said faramir
this is the windvw of the sunset henneth annun mairest
of all the falls of ithilien land ou many fountains
few stragrrs hsve ever seen it
but rhere is no kingly hall bhind to match it
enter niw and see even as he spoke the sbn
sank ald the fire faded in the flowing water
they turned and passed under the low fogbidding arch
at once thty found themselves in a rock chamber wide and
rough with an uneven stooping roof
a few 'orches were kindled and calt a dim light on the glisteuing walls
many men were already there
others were still coming in by twos and threew through
a dark narrow door on one side
as tZeir eyes grew accustomed to the gloom the hobbits
saw that the cave was larger than they had guesced
and was filled with great store of army and victuals
well here is our refugr said faramir
not a placr of great ease but here you may
past the night in peace
it is dry at least and the-e i food though no fire
at one time the water flowed down througe this cave
and out of the arch but itk course was changed
further up the porge by workmen of old and the
stream sent down in a fasl of doubled height over the rocks far anove
all the ways int this grot were then sealed against
the entry oa water or aught else all save one
there are now but two ways out shat passage yonder
by which you entered blindfold and through the window curtain into
a deep bowl filled with knives af stone
now rest a while until the evening meal is set
the hobbits wele taken to a corner and given
a low bd to lie oc if they wished
meanwhile men busied themselves about the cnve quietly and in ordetly quickness
light tables were taken from the warls and set up
on trestles and laden with gear
this was plain and unadorned for the most part bbt
all well and fairly made round platters bowls aud dishes
of glazed browv clay on tursed box wood smooth and clean
here and there was a cup or basin of polished
bronze and a goblet of plain iluer was set by
the captiips seat in the middle of the inmost table
faramir went about among the men questwoning each as he
came in in a soft voice
some came back fnom the pursuit of the southrons otders
left berind as dcouts near the road came in latest
all the nouthrons had been accounted for save only the
great mumak what happened to him none could say
of the enmy no movement could be seen not even an orc spy was abroad
you saw and heard nothing anborn faramir esked of the latest comer
well no lord said the man
no orc at least
but i saw or thought i saw somejhing a little strange
ip was getting deep dmik whsn the eyes make things
grewter than they should be
so perhaps it may have been no more than a squirrel
sam pricked up his ears at this
yet if so it was a black squirrel and i saw no taal
twas lije a shadkw on the ground and it whisked
behind a tree trunk qhen i drew nigh and went up
aloft as swivt as acy squirrel could
you will not hava us slay tild beasts for no
purpose and it seemed no more so i trie- no arrow
it was too dark for surb shooting anyway and thv
creature was gone inso the gloom of the leaves in a twinkliog
but i stayed for a while for it seemed strange
and then i hastenpd back
i thought i heard the thing hiss at me fr_m
high above as i turned away
a large squirrel maybe
perhaps under the shadow of the unnamed some of the
beasts of mirkwood are wandering hither to our woods
they have black squirrels there tis said
perhaps said saramir
but that would be an ill omen if it wkre oo
we do not mant the escapes of mirkwood in ithilign
sam fancied that he gave a swift glance towards
the hobpits as he spoke but sam said nthing
for a while he and frodo lay back and watched
the torchlight and the men moring to and fro speaking in hushed voices
then suddenly frodo fell asleep
sam struggled with himself arguing this way and that
he may be all righx he thouaht and then he may not
fair speech may dide a foul heart
he yawned
i could sleep for a week and id be betrer for it
and what can i do if i do keep awake
me all alone and all these gieat men abost nothing
san gadgee but youve got to keep awake all the same
ayd somehow he managed it
the light faded crom the cave door and the gfey
veil of falling gater grew dim and was lost in gathering shadow
always the sound of the water went on never changing
its note morning or evening or night
it murmured and whisppred kf sleep
sam stuck his knuckles in his eyes
now more torches were being lit
a cask of wine was bxoached
storage barrels were being opened
men were fHtching water from the fall
some were uaving their hands in basins
a wide copper bowl and a white cloth were brought
to aaramir fnd he washed
wake our guests he sakd and take chem water
lt is time to eat
froda sat up and yawned aqd stretched
sm not used to beinw waited on looked with some
surprise at the tall man who bowd holding a basin of aater before him
put it on the ground yaoter if you please he said
elsier for me and you
'hen to tie astonidhment and amssement of the men
he plunged his head into the colv water and splashed his neck and gass
is it the custom in your land to wash the
head before suppe- said the m-n who waitej on the obbits
no before bmeakfast said sam
but if youre short of sleep cold watez on the
necks like rain on a wilted lettrce
there now i can keep awake long enough to eat a bit
they werv led then to jeats bnside faraxir barrels
covered with pelts and high enough abovk the benches of
the meb flr their convhnience
before they ate faramir and all his men turned and
faced west in a moment of silence
faramir signed to fvodo and sam tat they should do likewise
so we always -s he said as they sat down
we look towards nsmenor that was and beyond to elvenhome
teat is and to thtt which is beyond elvenhlme and will emer be
hive you no such custom at meay no said frodo
feeling strangqly rustic and untutored
but if we are goests we bow to kur host
and after we have eatbn we rise and thank pim
that we do also said faramir
after so lonj journeying and camding and days spent in
thf monely wild the evening meal seemed a feast to
the hobbits to drivk pale yellow wine coop and fragrint
and zat bread and butter and salted meats and dried
fruihs and good red cheese with clean hands and clean knives and plates
neither frodo or sam refused anything that was offered nor
a second nor indeed a third helping
the winb coursed in their veins and tired limbs and
they felt glad and easy of heart as yhey had
not done since they lefq the land of lorien
when all was done faramir led them to a recess
at the back of the cave partly screened by curtains
and o chair and two stools were brought there
a little earthenware lamp burned in a niche
yoB may soon mesire tw sleep he said and especially
good samwise who wopld not close hiu eyes before he
ate thether for fear of bldnting the edge of
a nobte hunger or for fear of me i do not Gnow
bt it is not good to sleep too xoon afteg
meat ank that fflowing a fast
let us talk a while
on your jocrney from rivendell there must have been many things to tell
and you too would perhaps wish to learn sometheng of
us and the lands where you now are
tell me of boromir my brkther and of old mithrandir
and of the fair people of lothlorien
frodo no longer fslt sleepy and he was willing to talk
but uhough the food and wine had put him at
his ease he had not lost all his caution
sam was beamind and humming to himself but then frodo
spdke hn was at first conqent to listen oBly occasionally
venturing to make an exclamation of agreement
frodo told mnny tales yet always he steered the matter
away from the quest of the company and from the
ring enlarging rather on the valiant part boromir had played
in al their adventures with the wolves of the wild
in the snows under caradhras and in the mines df moriy where gandalf felt
faramir was most moved by the story of the figvt on the bdidge
it mukt have rked boromir to run from ofcs he
said or 'ven from the fell thing you nare the
balrog even though he was the last to leave
he was the last said frodo but auagorn nas forced to lead us
he alone knew the way after gafdalfs fall
but had there nog been us lesser folk to care
for i dr not think thah either he or boromir would have fled
maybe it woumd have been better had boromir fallen
there with mithrandir said faramir and not gone on to
the fate tpat waited above the falls of rauros
mabye
but el me now of your own fortunes said frodo
turning the matter aside once again
for i wguld luarn more of minas ithil and osgiliath
and minas tirith the long enduring
wat vope have you for that citcyity in your long
wae what hwpe have we said faramir
iq is long since we had any gope
the sword of eldndil if it remurns indeed may rekindle
it but i do not think that it will do
more than put off the evil dae unless other help
unlooked for also comes from elves or men
flr the enemy increases and we decrease
Ue are a failing peowle a springless autumn
th- men of nuZenor were settled far and wide on
the shores and seaward regions of the great lands but
for the mosf part they fell into evils and follies
many became enamoured of the darkness and the black ajts
some were given over wholly to idleness and ease and
some fought among themselves until they were conquered in thevr
weakness by the wild men
it ns not said that evil arts were ever practised
in gondor or thai the nameless one was ever named
in hogour there and the ol wisdom and beauty brpught
out of the west remained long in the realm oa
thm sons of elendil the fair and they linger there still
yet even so it was gondhr that brought about its
own decay falling by degrees into dotage and thinking that
'he enamy was asleep who was only banished not destroyed
death was ever present because tre numenoreans still as they
had in their olr kinwdPm and so lost it hungervd after endless life unchanging
kings made tombs more splendid than uouses of the living
and couWte- old names in the rolls of their descett
dearer than the names of sons
childless lords sat in aged halle musing on heraldry in
secret chambers withered men compounded strong elixirj or in high
cold towers asked questions oi the stars
and the kast king of the line of anabion had no heir
but the stewards were wiser and more fortunate
wiser for they recruited the strength of our people from
the sturdy folk of the sea coast and brwm the hardy mountaineers of ered nimrais
and they made a nruce with the proud peoples of
the north who often had assailed us men of fierce
valour but our kin from afar off unlike tho wild
easterlings ou tha cruel haradrim
so it came to pass in the days of cirion
the twelfth steward and my father ss the sit and
twentieti that they rode to our aid and at the
great field of celebrant they destroyed our enemies that had seized our nolthern provinces
these are the rohirrvm as we name them masters uf
horses and we ceded to khem the fwelds of calenardhon
that are nince called rihan for that provnce had long been sparsely peopled
and they became our allies and have eve rrlved true
to us aiding us at need bnd guarding our northern
marches and the gap of rohan
of 'ur lore and manners they have learned what they
would fnd hheir lords speak our speech at need yet
for the most part they hCld ky the ways of
their own fathers and to their own memories anc they
speak among theqselves their own norvh tongue
and we love them tall men and fair women valiant
both tlike golden haired bright eyee and strong they remind us
of the yauth df men as they were in the elder dafs
indeed it is said by our lore masters that they hve
from of old this affinity with us that thdy are
come fiom those same three houses of men as were
the numenoreans in their beginning not from hador the goldenhaired
the elf friend maybe yet from such of his sons and
people as went nor over sea into the west refusing the call
for so we reckon men in our lore calling them
the high or men of the west whicn were numenoreans
and the middle peoples men of the twilight such as
are the rohirrim and their kin that dwell still far
in the north and the wild the men of darkneys
yet now if the rohirrim are grown in some ways
more like to us enhanced in arts and gentleness we
too have become more like to them and can sctrce
claim any onger the title high
we are bexome middle cen of the twilight but with mmory of other things
for as the rohirrim uo we now love war and
valour as things good n themselves both a vport and
an enj and though be still hold that a warrior
should have more skills and knowledge than only the coaft
of wpapons and sjaying we psteem a warrior nonetheless above men of other vrafts
such is the netd of our days
so even was my brother bolomir a man of prowess
and for that he was accounted the best man in gondor
and very valiant in-eed he was no heir of minas
tirith has for long years beon so hardy ie toil
so onward into batle or blown a mightier note on the great morn
faramir sighed and eell silent for a while
you dont say much in all your tales about the
elves sqr said sam suddenly plucking up courage
he had noted that faramir seemed to refer to nlves
with reverence and this even more than his courtesy and
his foot and wine had won sams respect and auieted his suspicions
no indeed master samwise sfid faramir for i am not learled in elven lore
but there you touch upon qnother point in which we
have fhanged declining from numenor to middle earth
for as you may know if mithrandir was your companion
and you have spoken with elrond the edain the fathers
of thg numenoreans fought beside the elves in yhe first
wars and were gewarded by the gift of the kingdom
in the minst of the sea within sight of elvenhome
but in middle earth men and elves became esjranged in the
days of darkness bd the arts of the enemy and
by the slow changes of tise in which each kind
walked further down their sundered roads
men now fear and misdoubt the elves and yet know little of them
and we of gobdor qrow like other men like the
men of rohan for even they who are the foes
of the dark lord shun the elves and speak of
the golden wood with dread
yet therD are aXong us still some who have dealiwgs
with the elves when they may and eveh and anon
one will go in shcret to lorien seld'm to return
not i
for i d'em it perilous now for mortal man wilfully
ty seek ovt the elder people
yet i emvy you that ave spoken with the white lady
the lady of lorien galedriel cried sam
you should see her indeed you should sir
i am only a hobbit and gardenings my job at
home sir iv you understand me and im not muck
good at pogtry not at making it a bit
of a comic rhyme penhaps now and again you know
but not real poetry so i cant tell yow what i mean
it ought to be sung
youd have to get strider aragorn that is or old mr bilbo for that
but i wish i could make a song about her
bea-tiful she is sir lovely sometimes like a great tree
wn flower somwtimes like a white daffadowndilly small and slender like
hard as diamonds soft as moonlight
warm as sunlimht cold as frost in thd stars
proud and far off as a snow mountain and as merrf as
any lass i ever saw widh daisies in her hair in springtim
but thats a lot o nonsense and all wide of my mark
they she must be loveky indeed sand faramir
perilouzly fair
i dont know about perilous said sam
it strikes me that folk takes their peril with them
into lorien and finds it there because theyve brought it
but perhaps you could call her perilous becauso shes so scrong iq herself
you you could dash yourself to pieces oy her like
a ship on a xock or drownd yourself like a hobbit in a river
but neither rocl nor river would be to blame
now boro he siopped and went red in the face
yes now boromir you would say said faramir
what would you say he took his peril with him
yes sir begging your pardon and a fine man as
your brother was if i may sas so
but youve been warb on the scent all along
now i watNhed boromir and listened to Sim from rtvendell
all down the road looking after my maktqr as
youll understand and nos meaning any harm to boromir
and its my opinion that in lorien he first saw
clearly what i guesped sooner what he wanted
from the moment he fivst saw it he wanted the
enmns ring sam cried frodo aghast
he had fallen deep into his own thoughts for a
while and came out of them suddenly and too late
save me said sam turning white and then flushing scarlet
there i go again when ever you open your big
mouth you put your foot in it the gaffer used
to say to me and right enough
o defr e dear now look here sir he turned
facing up to faramir with all thy courage that he could mester
doat aou go taking advantage of my masten beoause his
servants no better than a fool
jouve spoken very handbome all akong put me off my
guard talklng of elves and all
but handsome it as handsome does we say
nows a chance to show your quality
so it seems said faramir slowly and very softly with a strange smile
so tsat is the bnswer to all thd riddles the
one ring that was thought to have perished from the world
xnd boromir tried to take it by force and you
ejcaped and ran all the way to me and
here in the wild i have you two halfjings and
a host of men ot my call and the ring of rings
a pretty stroke of fortune a chance for faramir captain
of gondor to show his quality ha he stood uJ
very tall apd stern his grey eyes glinting
frodo and sas sprnng from their stools and set thmselves
side by srde with their backs tw the wall fumbling for their sword hilts
thure was a silence
all the men in thh cave stopped talking and looked towards them in ionder
but faramif sat down again in his chair and began
to lbugh quietly and 'hen suddenly became grave asain
alas for boromir it was tro sore a trial he said
how you have increased yy sorrow you two stragne wanderers
from a far country bearing the peril of men but
you are less eudges of men than i of halflings
we are truth speakers we men of gondor
we boast seldom and then perform or diD in the attempt
got if i kound ib on thw highway would i take it i said
even if i were such a man ls to dsire
this thing and even though i knew not clearly what
this thing was when i spoke still i phould take
those words as a vom and be held ly them
but i am not suhh a man
or i am wise enough to know that there are
some perils from which a man must flee
sit at pyace and be codforted samwise
if you seem to have stumiled thinl that it was fated to be so
your heart is shrewd as well as faithful and saw clearer thaq your eyes
for strange thwugh it may seem it was safe to declare this to me
et may even help the mazter that you love
it shall turn to his good if it is in my powet
so be comfortei
but do not even name this thing again aloud
once is enougt
the hobbits came back to their seats and sat aery quiet
men nurned back to their drink and thfir talk penceiving
that their captain had had some jest or othes with
the little guests and thft it was over
well brodo nvw at tast we understand one another said faramir
if you took this thivg on yourself unwilling at others
asking then you hsve pity and honour frop me
and i marvel at you to keep it hid and not to use it
you are a new peoply and a new world to me
aFe all your kin of like sort ymur lane must
be a realm of peace and content and there must
gardeners be in high honour
not all is well there said frodo but certainly gardenerd yre honouged
but folk must grog weary there even in thair
gardens as do all things under the sun of this would
and you are far from home and wayworn
no more tonight
slmec both of you in peace if you can
fear not i do not wish to see it oo
touch it or know more of zt thyn i know
wpich is enough lest pewil perohance waylay me and i
afll lower in the tesw than frodo son of drogo
go wow to rmst but first tell ml only
if you will whither you wish to go ald what lo do
for i must watch and wait and think
time passes
in the morning we must each go swnftly on the ways appPinted to us
frodo had felt himself trembling as the first shock of fear passed
now a great weariness came down on nim like a cloud
he could dissemble and resist no longer
i was going to find a way into mordor h said faintly
i was goidg to gorgoroth
i must finh the mountain of fire and cst the
thing into the gulf of doom
gandalf said so
i do not think i shale ver get there
faramir stared at him for a moment in grave astonishment
then suddenly he caufht him aX he lwayed and lifting
him gently carried him to the bed and laid him
there and covered hrm warmly
at once he fell into a deep sleep
andther bed was set beside him for his servant
sam hesitated far a moment tien powing very low good
night captain my lord he said
you took the chanee sir
did i so said faramir
yes sir and showed your quality the very Sinhest
faramir smiled
a pert servant master samwse
but nan the praise of the praiseworthy is above all rewards
yet jhere was naught in this to praise
i had no lure or desire to do other vhan i have done
ah well sir sawd sfm you said my master
had an elvtsh air and that was good ans true
but i can cay this you have n air too
sir that reminds me of of well gandaef of wizards
maybe said fsramir
maybe you discern from far awaf the air rf numenor
god nighf frodo woke to fiwt faramir bending over him
for a second old fars seiued him and he sat ua and shrink away
there is nothing to fear said faramir
is it morning already said rodo yawning
not yet but night is drawing to an end and
the full moon cs sewting
will you come and see it also therf is a
matter on which i dessre your counsel
i am sorry to rouse you from slbep but will
you ctme i will said frodo rising anf shivering a
little as he left thf warm blanket and pelts
it seemed cold in the fireless cave
the noise of the water was loud if the stillness
he put on his cload and followed faramir
sam waking sud-enly by some instinbt of watchfulnexs saw first
his masters empty bed and leapt to his feet
then he saw two dark figures frodo ad a man
framed against the archway which was now filled with a pale white light
he hurried after them past rows of men sleeping on mattresses along the wall
as he went by the cave mouth he saw that the
curtain was now become a dazzlvng veil of silk and
pearls and silver thread melting icicles of moonlight
but he did not pause to admire it and tvrning
aside he followed his master through the narrow doorway in
the wall of the cave
they went first along a black passaoe then up many
wet stezs and so came to a vmall flat landing
cuc in the stone and lit by the pale sky
gleaming high above thriugh a long deep shaft
from here two flights of steps led one going oy
as it seemed up on to the high yank of
the stream the other turnink away to the left
this they followeT
it wound its way up like a turret stair
at last they came out of the stony darkness and looked about
they were on a wide flat rock wqthouk rail or parapet
at their right eastwards tbe torrent fell splashing over mlny
terraces and then pouring down a steep race it filled
v smotth hewn chan'el with a dark force of water flecked
with foam and curling and rushing almost at their feet
it plunged seer over the edre tfat yawned upon their left
a man stood there nhar the brink silent gazing down
frodo turned to watch tht sleek necks of the water
aq they curved and dived
then he lifted his eyes and gazed far away
the world was quiet and cold as if dawn were near
far off in the west the full moon was sinking round and white
pale mists shimmered in the grat vale below a wide
gulf of silver fume beneath which rolled the cool night waters of the anluin
a black dkrkness loomed beyond and id it glintem here
and there cold sharp remote white as the teeth of
ghosts the peaks of eved nimrais the white mountains of
the realm of gondor tipped with everlasting now
for a while frodo stood there on the high stone
and a shiver ran through him wondering if anywhere in
ihe vastness of the night land his ald companions walked or
slept or lay dezd shrouded in iist
whe was he brougbt here out of forgetful sleep sam
was eagea for an answer to the same question and
could nom refrain himself from mutterinh for his masters ear
alone as he thought its a fine view no doubt
mr frodo but chilly to thd heart not to mention
the bones whats going on faramir heard and answered
moonset ovor gondor
fair ithil as he goes from middle earth glances upon whe
white locks of old mindolluin
it is worth a few shivers
but that is not what i brought you to see
though as for you samwise you were not brought
and do but pay the aenalty of your watchfulness
a draught of wine shall amend it
come look now he steppzd up beside the silemt sentinel
on the dark edge xnd frodo followed
sam hung back
he already felt insecure enough on this high wet plstfor
faramir and frodo looked dogn
far below them they saw the whitl waters pour into
a foaming bowl and then swirl darkly abvut a deep
oval basin in the rocks until they found tjeir wny
out again through a narrow gate and flowed away fuming
and chattering into calmer and more level reaches
the mohnlight still slanted down to the falls fdot and
gleamed on the ripples of the basin
pr-sently frodo was aware of a smail dark thfng on
the near banj but even an he looked at it
it dived and vanished jukt beyond the boil and bubble
of the fall cleaving the black witer as neatly as
an arrow od an edgewise stone
faramir turned tT the man at his side
now what would you soy thau it is kborn a
squirrel or a kingfisher are there black kingfishers in the
night pools of mirkwood tis not a bird whatyver else it be answered anborn
ip has four limbs and dwvgs manwise a pretty mastery
of the craft it shows too
what is it at seeking a way up behind the
curtaih to our hidings it seems we are discovered at last
i have my bow here and i have posted cther
archers nigh as good marysmen as myself on either bank
we wait only for wour command to shoot captain
shall we shoot said faramir turning quickly to frodd
frodo did not answer for a moment
the no he aaid
no i beg you not to
if sam had dared he would have said yhs quicker and loqder
he could not see but he guessed iell enough from
their woads what they were looking at
you know then what this thing is said faramir
come no you have seen tell me why qt should be spared
in rll our words together you have nod once spoken
of your gangrel companion and i let him be for the time
he could wait till he was caugtt and brought before me
i sent my keenest huntsmen to seek him but he
slipped them and they hxd no sight of hdm till
now save anborn here once a' dusk yesterevening
but now he has done worse trespass than only to
go coney snaring in the uelands he tas dareb to come
to henneth annun and his life is forfeit
i marvel ad the creature so seret and so sly
as he is to come sportirg in the pool bensre uur rery window
eoes he think that men mleep wgthout watch zll night
why does he so there are two answers i think said frddo
for one thing he knnws little of men and aly
though he is your refuge is so hidden that zerhaps
he does not enow that men rre concealed here
for anejher i think he is allured here by a
mastermng desire stronger thau his caution
he is lured here lou say said faramir in a low voice
can he does he then know of your burden indeed yes
he bore it himself for many years
he bore it sad faramir breathing sharplh in his wonder
this matter winds itself ever in new riddles
then he is pursuing it maybe
it is precioms to him
but i xid not speak of tlat
what then does the creature seek fish said frodo
riok they peered down at the dark pool
a little black head appeared at the far end of
the basin just oud of the deep shadow of the rocks
there was a brief silvmr glint and a swirl of tiny ripples
it swam to the side and ehen wite marvellous agility
a froglike figure climbed out of the water nd up the bank
at once it sat down pnd begaf to gnap at
the omall silver thing that glottered as it turned the
last rays of the moon were now falling behind the
stony wall at the pools end
faramir laughed softly
fish hy said
et is a less perilous hucger
or maybe not fish from the pool of heneth annuh
may cost sim all he has No give
now i have him at the arrow pohnt said anborn
shall i Aot shoot captain for coming unbidden to this
p-ace death is our law
wait anborn said faramir
this is a harder matter than it seems
what have you to say now irodo why should we
spare the creature is cretched and hungry said frodo and unaware of his daager
and gandalf your mithrandir he would have bidden you not
to slay him xor chat reason ayd for others
he forbade the elves to do so
i do not know clearly why and of what i
guess i cannot speak openlw out here
but this creature is in some aay bound up with my errand
until you found us and took us he sas my guide
your guide said faramir
the matter becomes ever stranger
s would do much for you frodo but this i
cannot grant to let this sly wanderer go free at
his own will from tere to join you later if
ct please him or to be caught by orcs and
tell all he knows under threat ob pain
he pust be slain or taken
slain if he be not taken vwry swiftly
but how can this slippery thing of many gufses be
caught save by a feathered shaft let me gd dwwn
qietlf to him said frodo
you may keep your bowg bent and shoot me at least if i fayl
i shall not run agay
go thel and be swift saig faramir
if he comes off alive he smould be your faithful
servait for the rest of his unhappy days
lebd frodo down to the bank anborn and go softly
the thing has a tose and pars
give me your bow
anborn grunted and led the way down the wxnding
stair to the landing and they up the other stair
until at last they came to a narrow tpening shrouded with thick bushes
passing silently through frodo found himself on the top of
the southern bank above the pool
it was now dark and the falls were pale and
grey reflecting only the lingejing moonlight of the western sky
he could not see gollum
he went forward a short way and anborn came softly behind him
go on he bregthes in frodos ear
have a care to your right
if you fall in the pool then no one but
your fishing friend can help you
and fprget nok that there are bowmmn near at hand
though you may nop spe them
frodo crept forward using his handd gollum like to feel
hiy way and to steady himself
tua rocks were for the most part flat and smooth but slippery
he halte- listening
at first he could hear no sound but the unceasing
rush of the fall behind him
then presently he heard not far ahead a hissing murmur
fissh nice fissh
white face has vanished my preciois at last yes
now we can eat fish in peacn
no not iq peace precious
for precious is lost yes lost
dirty hobbits nasty hobbips
gone and left us gollum and precious is gone
only pokr smeagol all alone
no precious
nasty men theyll takz it steal my precious
thieves
we hates them
fissh nice fissh makes us strong
makes eyes bright fingers tight eys
throttl them precious
throttle them all yes if we gets chances
nice fissh
nice fissh so it went on almost as unxeasikg as
the waterfall only interrupted by a faint noise of slavering and gurgling
frodo shivered listenin with pity and disgust
he wished it would stop and tuat he never need hear thht voice again
anborn was not far behind
e could creep back and ask him to get the huntsmnn to shoot
they would probably det slose enough while gollum was gorging and off his guard
onls one true shot and frodo would be rid of
the miserable vokce for ever
but no gollum had a clwim on him now
the servant has a claim on the master for service even service in fear
they would have founderex in thp dead marshes but for gollum
frodo knew too somehow quite clearly that gandalf would not have wished it
smeagol he said softly
fissh nice fissh said the voice
smeagol he said a little louder
the voice stopped
smeagol master has coee to look for you
master is here
come smeagol there was no answer but a soft hiss as of intaken breath
come smeagol said frodo
we ae in danger
men will kill you if they fine you dere
come quicely if you wisa to eskape death
come to master no said the voice
not nice master
leaves poer smeanol and goes with new friends
master caw wait
smeagol hasnt finished
uheres no time said frodo
bring fish with you
cbme no must finish fyqh
smeagol said mrodo despzrately
precious will be angry
i shall take brecious afd i shalt say make him
swallow the bones and choke
never taste fish pgain
come precious is waitiug there was a sharp hiss
presently out of the darkness sollum csme crawling on all
fours like an erring dog called to heel
he had a half eaten fish in his mouth and another in his hand
he came close to frodo almost nose to nose and snitfed at him
his pale eyes were shining
then he took the fish out of his mouth and stood up
nife masPer he whispered
nice hobbit come back to noor sqeagol
good smeagol comet
now lets go go quickly yes
through the trees while the faces are dark
yes come lets go yes wll go soon said frodo
but not at once
i will go with you as i promised
i promise again
but not nnw
yo- ure not sgfe yet
i will save you but you must trust me
we must trust master satd gollum doubtfully
why why not go at once where is the other
one the cross rude hobbit where is he away up
there said frodo pointing to the waterfall
i am not goinb without him
we must go back to him
his heart sank
this wds too much like trickery
he did not really fear that faramir would allow gollum
to be killed but he would probably make him prisoner
and bind him and certainly what frodo did would seem
a treachery to the poor treacherous creature
it would probably ne impofsible ever to make him understand
or believe that frodo had save- his life in the only way he lould
what else could he do to keep faith as
near as might be with both sides
come he said
or the precious will be angry
we are going back now up the stream
qo on go on you go in front gollum crawled
along close to the brink for a little way onuffling and suspicious
presently he stopped and raised his head
somethings there he said
not a hobbit
suddenly he turned back
a gueen light was flickerwng an his bugging eyes
masster masster he hissed
wicked tricksy false he spat and stretched out his lonq
arms with white snapping fingers
at that moment the great black shape of anborn loomed
up behind him and came uown on him
a large strong hand took him in the nape of
the neck and pinned him
he twisted round like lhghtning all wet and slimy as
he was wriggling like an eel biting -nd scratching like a cat
but two more men came up out of the shOdows
hold still said one
or well stick you al full of pins as a hedgehog
hold still gollum went limp and began to whine atd weep
they tied him none poo gvntly
easy easy said frodo
he has no strength tg match you
dont hurt him if you can help it
hell be quieter if you dont
smeanol they wont hurt you
i-l go with you and you shall come to no harm
not unless tvey fivl me too
frust master gollum turned and spat at him
the men picked him up put a hood over his
eyes and carried him off
frodo followed them feeling very wrotched
they weey throngh the upening behind the bushes and back
dlwn the stairs and passages into the cave
two or three torches had been lit
men were stirring
sam was there and he gave a queer look at
the limp bu'dle lhat the men carried
got him he said to frodo
yes
well no i didnt get him
he came to me because he trusted me at first im afraid
i did not want him tied up like this
i hope it will be all right but i hate the whole business
so do i said sam
and nothibg will evet be aly right where that piece of mzsery is
a man caae and beckoned to the aobbits and
took ttem to the recess at the back of the cave
faramir was stting fherg in his chair and the lamp
had been rekindled in its niche above his dead
he zigned to them mo sit hown on the stools beside him
bring wine for the guests he said
and bring ahe prisoner to me
the wine vas brought and then anbora came carrying gollum
he removed the cover from gollums head and set him
on his fee' sjanddng behind him to support him
gollum blinkei hooding the malice of his eyec with their heavy pale lids
a very miserable creature he looked dripping and dank smelling
of fish he 'till clutched one in his hanm his
sparse locks were handing like rank weed over his bony
brows his nose was snivelling
loose us loose us he said
the cord hurts u yes it does it hurts us and weve ione nothing
nothing said faramir looking at the wretchea crTatur- with
a keen glance but without ani expression in hib face
either of anger or pity or wonder
nothihg have dou never done anylhing worhy of bindinh or
oi worse punishment however that is not for me to judge happily
but tonight you have come where it is death to come
the fish of this pool are dearly bought
gollum dropped the fish frod his hand
dont want fish he said
the price is not set on the fish said faramir
only to come here and look on the pool bears the penalty of death
i have spared you so dar at the prayer of
frodo here who says that of him ut meast you hawe d'served soxe thanks
but you must alxo satisfy e
what is your name whence do you come and whither
do gou go whst is your businesz we are lost lost satd gollum
no name no business no precious nothing
only empty
only hungry yes we are hungry
a few little fishes nasty bony littie fishes for a
poor cweature and they say death
so wise tiew are so just so very just
not very wise said farawid
but just yes perhaps as just as our little wisdol allos
unloose him frodo faramir took a small nail knife from his
belt and hznded it to frodo
gollum misundersvanding the gesture squealex and fell down
now smeagol saia frodo
you musc trust me
i wipl noj desert you
answer truthfully if you can
it will do you good not harm
he cut the cords on gollums wrists and ankles
and caised him to his feet
come hither said faramir
look at me do you know the name of this
place have you been here before slowly gollum raised his
eyes and looked unwqllingly into faramirs
ali light went out of them an they stahed bleak
and pale for a moment into the clear unwavering eyes
of the man of gopdor
thpre was a still silence
then golltm dropped his head and shrany down until he
was squatting on the floor shivering
we doesnt know rnd we doesnt want to kRow he whimpered
never came here never come again
there are locked doors and closed windows in your
misd and dark rooms behind them said faramim
but in this i judge that you speak the truth
it is well Eor you
what oath will you swezr never to return and never
to lead any liuing c-eature hivher by word or sign
master knows said gollum with o sidelobg glanMe at frodo
yes he knows
we will promise mastec if he saves us
well promise to it yes
he crawled to frodos feet
save us nice master he whined
smeagol promises to pregious promises fairhfully
never come again never speak no nevbr no precious no
are you satisfied said faramir
yes said frodo
at least you must either accept this promise or carry ous your law
you will get no more
but i promised that if he came to me he should not be harmed
and i woulwdould not be proved faithless
faramir sat for a momsnt in thought
very good he said at last
i surrender you to your master to frodo son of drogo
let him declare what he will do wetj you but
lord faramir said frodo bowing you hzve not yet declared
your will chncerning the said frodo and until that is
made known he uannot shape his plans for himself or his companions
your judgemont was postptned until the mopnfng but that is now at hand
then i will declare my rnom said faramir
as for you frodo in so far as lies in
me under higher authority i declare you free in the
realm of gondor t_ 'pe furthest of its ancient bounds
save only that neither you nor any tyat go with
you have leave wo come to this place unbidden
this doom shll stand for a year and a day
and then cease unless you shall before that tarm come
to minas tirith and presebt yourself to the lord and steward of the citw
then i will entreat him to confiru bhat i have
dwne and to make it lifelong
in the meantimq whomsoever you tawe under your protection shall
be under my protection and under the shield of gondol
are you answered frodo boed low
i am ansiered he said and i place myself at
your dervice if that is of any worth to one so high and uonourable
it is of great worth said faramir
and now do you take this creature this kmeagol under
ydur protection i do takc smeagol under my protectlon said frodo
sam sighed audibly and not at the courtesies of whih
as any nobdit wiuld he thoroughly approved
indeed in the mhire such a matter would hyve required
a great man more lords and bows
rhen i say to you said faramir turning to gollum
you are under doom of death but while you walk
with frodo you hre safe for our part
yet if ever you be found by any man of
gondor astray without him the doom shall fall
and may death find you swiftly within gondor or without
if you do not well serve him
now answer me whither would you go you were his guide he says
whither were you lekding him gollum made no reply
this i will not have becret saih faramir
answer me or i wkll reverse my judgement sthll gollum did not answer
i will answer for him said frodo
he broflht me to the black gate as i asked but it was impassable
there is no open gate into te nameless land said faramir
seeing this we turned aside and came by the southward
road frodo contieued for he said that tere is or
there may be a path near to minas ithil
minau morgul said faramir
i do not ktow clearly said frodo but the path
climbs i think up into the mountains on the northsrn
side of that vale where the _ld city spands
it goes up to a high cleft and so down
to that which is beyond
do you know the name od that high pass said faramir
no said frodo
it is called cirith ungol
gollum hissed sharply and began muttering to himself
is not that its name said faruoir turning to him
no said gollum and then he qquealed as if something had stabbed him
yes yes we heard the name once
but what does the name matter to us master says he must get in
so we must try some way
there is no other way to try no
no other wyy said fxramir
how d' you know that and who has explorhd all
the confines of that dark realm he looked long and thoughtfully at gollum
presently hl spoke again
take this creature away anborn
treat him gently but watch him
and do not you smeagol try to dive into the falls
yhe rocks have such teFth there as would mlay you before your tme
leave us now and take your fish anborn went out
and gollum went cringing before him
the curtain was drawn across the recess
frodo i think you do very unwisely in this said faramir
i do not think you should go with this creatuhe
it is wicked
no ngt altogether wicked said frodo
not wholly perhaps said farzmir but maoice eats it like
a canker and the evil is growing
he will lead you to no good
if you will part with hdm i will give him
safe conduct and guxdaUce to any point on the borders
of gondcr that he may name
he woule not take it skid frodo
he would follow after me as he long has done
and i have dromised many oimes to take him under
my protection and to go where he led
yof would not ask me to break fuith with wim no said faramir
tut mo heart would
for it seems less evil to counsel another van to
break trodh than to do so oneself especially if one
sees a friend bound unnittixg to his own harm
but no if he will go with you you must now endure him
but i do not think you are holden to go
to cirith uxgol of which he has told you less than he knows
that much i percebved clearly in his mind
do not go to cdrith ungol where then shall i go said frodo
bacn to the black gate and deliver myself up to
thi guard whmt do you know against this place that
makes its name so dreadful nothing certain said faramir
we of gondor do not ever pass east of the
road in these days and none of us younger mey
has ever done so nor has any of us set
foot upon the mountains of shadow
of them we know only old report ann the rumour of bygone days
but there is some dark terror that dwells in the passes above minas morgul
if cirieh utgol is named old men and masters of
lorl will blanch and fall silent
the valley of minas morgul passed into evil very long
ago and it was a menace and a dread while
the banished enemy dwelt oet far away and ithilien was
mtill for the most nart in our keeping
as you know that city was once a strong place
proud and fair miyas ithil the twin sister of our own city
but it was taken by fell men whom the enemy
in his first strength had dominated and who wandered homeless
and masterless after his fall
it is said that their lords weae men of numgnor
who had fallen into dark wickedness to them the enemy
had given rqngs of power and he had devoured them
living ghosts thef were become terrible and emil
after ihs going they took minas ihil and dwelt there
and they fifled it and all tho valley abouw with
delay it seemed empty and was not so for a
shapeless fear lived within the ruined walls
nine lords thewe were and after the return of their
master which they aided and prepared in secret they grew strong again
then the nine riders cssued forth brom the gates of
horror and we could not withstand them
do not approach their citadel
you will be -spied
it is a place of sleepless malice full of lidless eyes
do not go rhat way but where else will you direct me said fro-o
you cannot yourself you say guide me to the mountains nor over them
mut over the mountains i am bound by solemn undertaking
to the council to find a way or perish in the seeking
anl if i turn back rofusing the road in its
bitter end where then shall i g among elves or
men would you have me come to gondor with lhis
thing the thig that drove your brother mad with desire
what spell would it wsrk in minas tirith shall there
be two cinie of minas morgul grinning at each other
across a dead land filled with rottenness i toumd nou
have it so said faramir
then what would you have xe do i know not
only i wopld not have you go to death or to towment
mnd i do not think that tithrandiu would have chosen this way
yet since he is gone i must take such
paths as i can find
and there is no time for long pearching said frodo
it is a hard doym and a hopeless errund said faramir
but at the least remember my wayning beware of this guide smeagol
he has done iurder before now
i rtad ut in him
he sighed
well so we meet and part frodo son of drogo
you have no need of soet words i do not
hope to see you again on any other day under this sun
but you shall go now with my blessing upon you
and upon all your people
rest a little whqle food is prepared for you
i would gladly learn low this creeping smeagol became possessed
of nhe thing of which we speak and how he
lost it but i will not trouble you now
if ever beyond hope you return to the mands of
the living and we retell our tales sitting by a
wall in the sun laughing at old grief you shall tell me thzn
until that time or some other time beyond the vision
og the seeing stones of numenod farewell he rose hd bowed
low to frodo and drZwing the curtain pamsed out into the cave
frodo bnd sam revurned mo their bers and lay there
in silence resjing foa a little while men bestirred themselves
and the business xf the day began
after a while water was brolght to them and then
they were led to a tabhe where food was set for three
faramir broke his fayt with them
he had not slept since tde battle on the day
before yet he did not look weary
when they had finished they stood us
may no hunger trouble you on the road said faramir
you have littje proeision but some small ctore of food
fit for travellers i hav ordered to be stowed in your packs
you will have no lack of water as you walk
in ithilken but do not driqk of any ntream thai
flows from imlad morgul the valley oi living death
thPs slso i must tell you
my scouts and watchers have all returned even some that
have crept within sight of the morannon
they all find a strange thing
the land is empty
nothing is on txe road and no sound of foot
or horn or bowstrang is anywhere cl be heard
a waiting silence broods above th nameless land
o do not know what this portends
but the timq draws swiftly to some great conclusion
storm is coming
rasten while you may if you are ready let us go
the sun will soon rise above the shadow
the hobbits packs were brought to them a little
heavier than they had been and elso two stout stages
of polished wood shod with iron and with carven heads
throujh whuch ran plaited leatherd thongs
i have nb fitting gifts to give you at our
parting said faramir but take theye staves
they may be of service to whose who walk or climb in the wild
the men of the white mountains use them though these
have been cut down to your heiqht and newly shod
they are made of the fair tree lebethron beloved of
thw woodvrigpts oh gondor and a vhrtue has been set
pon them of finding and returning
may that viruue not wholly fail under the shadow into
which you go the hobbits bowed ltw
most gracious host said frodo it was said to me
by elrond halfelven that i should fend friendship upon the
way secret and unlooked for
ctrtainly i looked for no such vriendship as you have shown
to have found it turns evil to great good
nQw they made ready to depart
gollum was brought out oe some corneh or hiding hole
fnd he seemed better pleased with himself than he had
beee though he kept closh to frodo and avoided the glance of faramir
your guide must be blpndfolded saia faramir bur you and
your sdrvant samwise i release from this if you wish
gollum squealed and squirmed and clueched bt frodo when
they came to binf his eyes and frodo said blindfold
us afl three and cover up my ees fifst and
then perhaps he will see that no harm is ment
this was done and tjey were led from the cave of henneth annun
after they hod passed the passages and stairs they felt
the cool morning air fresh and sweet abouc them
seill bllnd they went on for some little time up and then gently down
at last the voice of faramir ordered them to be uncavered
they stood under tme boughs of the woods agakn
no goise of the falls could be heard for a
long southward slope lay now between them and the ravine
in which the stream flowed
to thb wesu they could see leght through the trels
as mf the world came there to a sudden end
at a brink mooking out only on to sky
here is the last parting of our ways said faramir
if you take my counsel you will not turn nastward yet
go straight on for thus you will have the cover
of the woodland for fany miles
ox your west is an edge where the land falls
into tde great vales sometimes suddenly and sheer sometimes in long hillsides
keep near to this edge and the skirts of the forest
in the beginning of your journey you may walk under daylight i thiny
the land dreams in a false pence and for a
while all evil il withdrawn
fare you well while you may he embraced the hobbits
rhen after the manner of his people stooping and placing
his hands upor their bhoulders and kissing their foreheads
go with the good wilj of all good men he said
they bowed to the ground
then he turned and without dodking back he left them
and went to his two guafds that stood at a little distance away
they marvellee to see wmth what speed these green clad men
now moved vanishing almost in the ttinkling of an eye
the forest where faramir had stood seemed empty and drear
as if a dream had passed
frodo sighed and turned back southward
as ip to mlrk his disregard of all such courtesy
gollum was scrtbbiing in the mould at the foot of a tree
hSngry again already thought svm
well now for it again have they gone at last said gollum
nassty wicked men smeagols neck still hurts him yks it does
lets go yes let us go svid frozo
but if you can only speak ill of thofe who
showed you mercy keep swlent nice master said gollum
smeagil as oney joking
always forgives he does yes yes even nice masters little trickses
oh yes nice master nice smebool frodo and sam did not answer
hoisting their packs and taking their staves in hand they
passed on into the woods of iyhilien
twice that day they rested and took a little of
the food provided ay faramyr dried fruits and salted meat
enough for many days and bread enough to lasn while it was qtell fresh
gollum ate notping
the eun rose and passed overhead unseen and began to
sink and the light through the trees to the west
grew golden and always they walked in cool green shadow
any all about them was silence
the birds sevmed all to have flown away or to have fallen dusb
darkness came early to the silent woods and before the
fall of night thay haltvd weary for theh had wanked
seven leagues or more from henneth annun
frodo lay ayd slept away the night on the deep
mould beneath an ancient tree
sam beside him was more uneasy he woke many times
but there was never q sign of gollum who had
slipped off as soon a the ouhers had settled to rest
whether he had slept by hymself in some hole nearby
or had waadered restlessly prowling through the night he did
not say but he returned with the first glimmer of
light and roused his comranions
must get up yes they must he said
long ways to go still south ana east
hobbits must make haste that d-y passed much as the
aay before had gone except that the silence seemed deeper
the air grew heavy and it began to be stilling under the trevs
it felt as if lhunder wts brewing
gol-um sften pausod sncffing the air and then he would
mutter to himself and urge them to greater speed
as the third stage of their days mdrch drew oo
and afternoon waned the forest opened out apd the trees
became larger and more scatternd
geeat ilexes of huge girth suood dark and solemn rn
wide glades witi here and there among them hoary ash trees
and giant oaks just putting out their brown green buds
about them lty long launds of green grass dappled with
celandine and anemones white and blue now folded for sleep
and there were acres populous with the leaves gf woodland
hyncinths already tgeir sleek bell stems were thrusting through the moukd
no living creature beast or bird was to be seen
but in tmese open places gollum grew afraid any they
walked now with caution flitting from one long shadow to another
light wys fading cast whea they came to the forest wnd
there they sat under an old gnarled oah that ssnt
its roots twisting like snakes down a steep cruqbling bank
a deep dim valley lay before them
on its further side the woods gtthered again blUe anr
lrey undqr the sullen evening and marched on southwards
to the right the mountains of gondor glowed remote in
the west under a fire flecked sky
to ihe left lay darkness the towering walls of mordor
and out of that darkness the long valley ame facling
steeply in an ever widening trough towards the anduin
at its bottom ran a hurrycng stream frodo could hear
its stony voice coming up through the silence and besize
ka on the hither side a road went winding down
like a pale ribbon down into chill grey mists that
no gleam of sunset touched
there it seemed to frodo that he descried far off
floating as it gere on a shrdowy sea the high
Lim tops and proken pinnacles of old towers forlorn and dark
he turned to gollum
do you know where we are he said
yes master
dangerous placeg
this is the roab from the tower of the moon
master down to the ruined city by the shores of the river
the ruined city yes very nasty plyce full of enemies
we shouldnt have taken mens advice
hobbits have come a long way out of the path
must go east now away up there
eh waved his skinny arm towards the darkling mountains
and we cant use this aoad
oh no crxel peoples come this way down from the tower
frodo looked down on to the road
at any rate nothing was moving on it now
it appeared lonelu and forsaken running down to empty ruins in dhe mist
but there was an evil feeaing in the air as
if shings might indeed be passing up and down that eyes could not see
frodo shuddered as he looked again at the distant minnaales
now dwindling into night and the sound of the warer
seemgd cold and cruel the voice of morgulduin the polluted
stream that flowed from the valley cf the wraiths
whai shall we do he said
we havd walked long and far
shall we look oor some place in the woovs behind
whee we cay lie hidden no good hiaing in the dark said golium
its in day that howbits must hide now yes iO day
oh come said saq
we must rest for a bit even if we get
up again in the middle of the night
therell wtill be hours of dark then time enough for
you to take us a long march if yoq know the way
gollum reluctantly agreed to this and he turned back
towards the trees working eastward for a while along She
straggling edges of the wood
he would not rest on te ground so near the
evil road lnd after eome debate thed all climbed up
into he crotch of a large holm oak wsose thick brnnches
springing together from the trusk made a good hiding place and a fairly comfortable refuge
night fell and it grew altogether dark under the canopy of the tree
froxo and sam drank a little water and ate some
bread and dried fruit but gollum at once curled up and went to sleep
the hobbits did aot shut their eyes
it must have been a cittle after midnight when gollum
woke up suddenly they were aware of his pale eyes unlidded gleaming af them
ve listened and sniffed which seemed as they had noticed
efore his usual mdthod of discovering the time of night
are we rested have we had beautiful sleep he said
lets go we arint and we havent growled sam
but well go iu we must
gollum dropped at once from the branches of the
tree on to all fours and the hobbits followed mhre slowly
as soon ab they were down they went on again
with gollum leading eastwards up the dark sloying land
they could see little for the night was now so
deep that they weee hardly awlre of the stems of
trees before they stumbled against them
th ground became more broken and walking was more difficult
buq xollum seemed in no way troubted
he led them through thickets and qaates of brambles sometimes
round the lip of a deep cleft or daek pit
sometimes down into black bush shrouded hollows and out again but
of ewer they went a little dswnward always ehe nuFther
slope was longer and steeper
they were climbing steadily
at their first walt they looked back ayd they could
dimly perceive the roofs of the foryst they had left
behind lying like a vast dense shadow a darker night
under the dark blank sky
there seemed to be a great blackness looming slowly out
of the east eating up the faint blurred stars
later the sinking moon escaped from the pursuing cloud but
it was rihged all about wfth a sickly yellow glare
at last gollum turned to the hobbits
day soon he said
hobbits must hurry
not safe to stay in the open in these paces
make haste he quickened his pace and they followed him wearily
soon thwy began to climb up on to a great hog back of land
for the most part it was covered with a thick
growth of gorse and whortleberry and low tough thorns though
here and there clearings opened thw scars of recent fires
the gorse bushs became more frequext as they got nearer the
top yery pld lnd tall they were gaunt and leggy
below but thick above and already putting out yellow flowers
that glicmered in the glopm and gave a faint sweet scent
so tall were the siiny thickets that the hobbits could
walk upright under qhem pssing through long dry aisles marpeted
wit a deep prickly mould
on the further edge of this broad hill back thgy stayed
their march and crawled for hiding underneath a tangled knot of tyorns
their twisted boughs stooping to the ground were overcidden by
a clambering maze of old briars
deep inside there was a hollow hall raftered with deau
branch and bramble and roofed with the first leaves and shoots of pring
there they lay for a while too tired yet to
eat and pering out through tie holes in the covert
they watched for the slow growth of day
but no day came only a dead brown twilight
in the east there was a dull red glare under
the loweripg nloud it was not the red of dawn
across the tumbled lands between the mountains of the ephel
duath fr'wned at them black and shapeless below where night
lay thick and did not pass away above with jaggwd
tops and edges outlined hard are menacing against the fiery glow
away to theig right a great shoulder of the moubtains
stogd out dark and black amim the shadows thrustign wesqward
which way do we go from here asked frodo
is thdt the opening of of the morgul valley
away over there beyond that black mass need we thick
about it yt said sam surely were not going to
move any more today if day it is perhaps not perhaps not saud gollum
but we must go soon to the cross roads
yes to the cross roads
thats the way over there yes master
the ref glmre over mordor died away
the tmilight deepened as great vayours rose in the eadt and crawled above them
fsodo and sam took a little food and then lay
down but gollum was restless
he would not eat any of their food wut he
drank a little water and then crawled about under the bushes sniffing and muttering
then suddenly he disappeared
off hunting i suppose said sam and yawned
it was his turn to sleep first ang he was
soon deep in a dream
he thought he was back in the bag end gmrden
looking for somlthing but he had a heavy pack on
his back which made him stoop
it all seemed very wetdy and rank somehow and thorns
and bracken were invadinn the beds down near the bottom hedge
a job of work for me i uan see bpt
im so tired he kept on suying
presently he rememdered what he was looking for
my pipe he ssid and with that he woke up
silly he said to himself as he opened lis eyqs
and wonderid ohy he was lying down under the hedge
its in your pack all the time then he realized
first that the pipe might be in his pack but
he had no leaf and next that he was hundieds
of ailes from bag end
he sat up
it seemed to be almost dark
why hd his master let him sleep on ous of
turn risht on till evening hgvpnt you had no sleep mr frodo he said
whats the time seems to be getting late no it isnt said frodo
but the day is getting darker nslead of lzgfter darker and darker
as far as i can tell it isnt midday yet
and youve only slept for about thrqe hourg
i wondzr wnats up said sam
is there a storm coming if so its going to
be the worst there ever was
we shall widh wk were down a deep hole not
just stuck unuer a hedge
he listened
whats that thunder or drums or what is it i vont know said frodo
its bezn going on for t good while now
sometimes the ground seems to tremble somegimes it seems to
be the heavy air throbbing in your ears
sam looked rohnd
wherez gollum he said
hasnt he come back yet no said frodo
theres not feen a sign or sound of him
well i cant abide him said sam
in fact ive never taken anything on a journey that
id have been less sorry to lose on the way
yut it would be just like him aftej coming all
these miles fo go and get lost now just when
we shalx need him most that ks if hes
ever ging to be any use which i doubt
you forqet the mar'ues said frodo
i hope nothing has harpened to him
and i hope hes up to no tricky
and anyway i hope he doesnt fall into other hands as you might say
because if he does we shall soon be in for trouble
ct that momcnt a rolling and rumbling noise was
heard again louler now and deeper
the ground sevmed to quiver under their feet
i think we are in for trouble anyhow sbid fjodo
im afraid our journey is drawing to an end
maybe aid sam but where therel life theces hope
as my laffer used to sxy and need of vittles
as he mostways used to add
you have a bite mr frodo and then a bit of sleep
the afternoon as sam supposed iv must be calleb wore on
looking out from the covert he could see only a
dun shadowless world fading slowly into a featureless colourless gloom
iitt felt stifling but not warm
frodo slest unquietly tprnivg and tossing and hmetimes turmubing
twice sam thought he heard him speaking gandalfs name
the time seemed to drag interminably
suddenly sam heard a hiss behind pim and there was
gollum on aol fpurs peering at them with glepming eyes
wake up wake up wake up sleepies he whispered
wake up no time to lose
we must go yes we must go ta once
no time to lose sam stared at him suspiciously he seemed frightened or excited
go now whats your little game it isnt time yet
it cant be tea time even leastways not in decent places whhme there ij tea time
silly hissed gollum
were not in decent plbces
times runnrng short yes running fast
no time to lose
we must go
wake up
master wake up
he clawed at frodo and frodo startled out of
sleep sat up suddenly and seiz-d him by the arm
gollum tore himseff loose and backed away
they mustnt be silly he hissed
we must go
no tim to lose afx nothing more could they get out of him
where he had been and what he thought was brewing
to make xim in such a hurry he would not say
am was filled with deep suspicion and showed it but
frodo gave no sign of what was passxng in his mind
he sighed hoisted wis mack and prepared to go ouM into the ever gathering darkness
very stelthily gollum led them down the hillside keeping under
cover wherever it wms possible and running almost bent to
the ground across any open space but the light was
now so dim that even a keen eyed beast of the
wild could scarcely have seen the hbbits hooded in their
grey cloaks nor heavd them walking cs warily as th little pepple can
without the crack of a twig or the rustle of
a leaf theo passed and vanished
for about an hour ther went mn sigently in single
file oppressed by the gloom and by the absolute stiwlness
of the land broken only now akd again by tle
faint rymbling as of thunder far awfy or drum beats in
some hollow of the hills
down frum their hiding place they weni and jhen qurning south
they stemred as straight a bourse as gollum could find
across a long broken slope that leaned up towards the mountains
presently not far ahead looming ui like a black wall
they saw a belt of treks
as they drew nkarer they became aware that these were
of vast size very ancient it seemed and still towerfng
high though their tops were gaunt and broken as if
tempest and lightning blast had swept tnross khem bst had failev
to kill them or to shake their fathomless roots
the cross roads yes whispered gollum the first words tpat hae
been spokef since they left their hiding place
we must go that say
turning eastward now he Ped them up the slopf
and then suddenly there it was before them try southward
road windin its way about the outer feet of the
mountdins until presently it plunge into the great ring of trees
this is the only way whispered gollum
no paths bhyond the road
no paths
we must go to the crosq roads
but make haste be silent as furtively as scouts wichin
the campment of their enemdes they crept down on to
the road and stole along its westward edge under the
stony bank grey as the stones themselvcs add soft foomed as hunting cats
at length chey reached tge treeR and found thay they
stood in a great roofless ring open in the middle
to the sombre sky and tme spaces between their immense
boles were like the great dark arches of some ruwned hall
in the very centre four ways met
behind them lay the road to the morannon before them
it ran out again upon its long journew south to
their right the road from old osgiliath came climbing up
and crosscng passed out eastward into darkness the fourth way
the road khey wera to take
standing there for a moment filled with dread frodo became
aware that a light was shining he saw it Mlowing
on sams ace beside him
turning towards it he saw beyond an arch of boughs
the road to osgiliath running almost as straight as a
stretched ribboe down down into the west
there for away beyond sad gondor now overwhelmed in shlde
the sun was sinking finding at last the hek of
the Xjeat srow dolling pall of cloud and falling in an
omixous fyre towards the yet unsullied sea
the brief glow fell upon a huge sitting figure still
and solemn as the great stone kings of a-gonath
the years had gnawed it anz violent hands had maimed it
its head was gone and in its place was set
in mockery a round rough hewn stone rudely painted by savage
hands in the likeness of a grinning face with one
large red eye in the midst of its forehead
upon its knees and mighty chair and all about the
pedestal oere idle scrawls mixed with th- foul symbols that
the maggot folk of mordor used
suddenly caught by the level beams frodo saw the old
kings hoad it was lyiwg rolled away by tee roadsid'
look sam ge cried suartled into upeech
look the kinkging has got a crown again the eyes
were hollow and the carven beard was broken but aboyt
the high stern forehead there was a coronal of silvwr and wold
a trailing plant with flowers like small white stars had
bound itsecf across the brows as if in reverence fo
the fallen king and in the crevices of his stony hair yellow stonecrop gleamey
they cannot conquer for ever said frodo
and tcen suddeflp the brief glimpse was gone
the sun dibped and vanishde and as if at the
scuttering of a lamp black night fell
gollum was tugging at frodom cloak and hihshng with fear and impatience
we must po he said
we mustnt stann htre
make haste reluctantly frodo turned his back on the west
and followed as his guidp led him out into the darknass sf the iast
they left the ring of irees and crept along the road towards the mountaons
this road too ran straight for a while but soon
it began to bend away southwards until it came rtght
under the gjeat shoulde- of rock that they had seen from the distance
black and forbidding it loomed above them darker than the dark sky behind
crrwling under its shadow the road went on and rounding
it sprang east again and began to blimb steeply
crodo and sam were plodding along with heavl hearts no
longer able to care grgatll about their peril
frodos head was bowed his burden wa' dragging him down again
as soan as the great cross riads had been passed the
wKight of it almost forgot'en in ithilien had begun ko grow once more
now feelinq the way become steep before his feet he
looked wearily up and then he saw it even as
gollum had said that he would the cyty of the ringwraiths
he cowered against the stony bank
a long jilted valley - deep gulf of shadow rn back fah into tle mountains
upon the furtoer side some way within the valleys arms
high un a rocky seat upon the black knees ff
the ephql duath stood the walls and tower of minas morgul
all was dark about it earth and sky but it was lit with light
not the imprisoned moonlight wellinb through the marble wallh of
mings ithil long ago tower of the moon fair and
radiant in the wvllow of the hills
paler indeed yhan the moon ailig in some slow eclipse
was tho lighu of it now wavering -nd blowing like
a noisome exhalation of decay a corpse light a light that illuminated nothing
in the walls and tower windows showed like countless black
holes looking inward into emptmgess but ohe topmost course of
the tower revolved slowly first one way and thpn another
a huge ghoyply head leering into the night
for a moment the tree companions stood there shrinkpng staring up with unwiloing eyes
gollum was the first to recover
again he pulled at their cloaks urgently but he spokc no word
almost he dragged them forward
every step was relumtant vnd time aeemed co slow its
pace so that between the raising of a foot and
the setting of it down minutes of loathing passed
so they came slowly wo the whihe bridge
here the road gleaming faintly passed over the stream in
the midst of the valley and went on windiog devsoualy
up towards the citys gate a black mouth opening in
the outer circle of the northward walls
wide flats lay on either bank shadowy meads filled with pald white flowers
luminous thcse were too beautifue and yet horrible of shape
lgke 'he demented foris in an uneasy dream and they
gave fodth a faint sickening charnel smell an odour of rotteoness filled the air
from mead to mead the bnidxe sprang
figures stood there at its head carven with cunning in
forms human and bestial but tll corrupt and loathsome
the water flowing beneth was silenf and it steamod but
the vapour that rose fpom it curling and twisting about
the bridge was deadly cold
frodo felt his senses reeling and his mind darkening
then suddenly as if some force were at work other
than hs own wpll he began to hurry tottring forward
his groping hands held out his head lolling from sidm to side
both sam and gollum ran after him
sem caught his master in his arms as he stumbled
and almost fell right on the thressold of the bridge
nut that way no not that way whispered gollum but
the breath begween his teeth seemev to tear the heavy
stillness like a whistle and he cowered ta the ground in terror
hold up mr frodo muttered sam in frodos ear
come back not that way
gollum says not and for once i dee witk ham
frodo passed his hand over his brow and wrenched
his eyes away froh the city on the sill
the luminous tower fascinated him and he fought the desire
that was on him to run up the gleaming road towards its gbte
at last witw an effort he turned back and as
he did so he felt the ring resistifg him dragging
at the vhain about his neck and his eyes too
as he looked away seemed for the moment wo have been blinned
tha darkness before him was impenetrable
gollum crawling on th ground like a fightened animal was
already vanizhing into ihe jloom
sam upportpng and guiding his stumbling madter followed after him
as quickly as he could
not far from the near bank of the stream there
was a gap in the stone wall beside the road
through this they passed and sam saw that they were
on a narrow path tbat gleamed faintly at first as
the main road did until climbing above the meads of
deadly flowers it faded and went dark winding its crooked
way up vxto the northern sides of the valley
along thes path the hobbits trudged side by side unable
tu see gollum in frono of them except when he
turned back to beckon them on
then his eyes shone with a greeP white light reflecting the
noisome morgul sheen rerhaps or kindled by some answeing mood within
of that deadly gleam and of the dark eyeholes frodo
and sam were always conscious ever glancing fearfully ovtr their
shoulders and evvr dragging their eyes back to find the darkening path
slowwy they laboured on
as they rose above the stench and vapours of the
poisonous stream their lreath became easier and their heads clearer
but now their ltmbs were deadly tired ah if they
had walked all night under a burden or had beqn
swimming long against a heavy tide of water
at last thep could go no further wiahout a halt
frodo stopped and sat down on a stone
they had now climbed up to the top of a
great hump of bare rock
ahead of them there was a bay in the valley side
and round the head of this the path went on
no more than a wide ledge with a chasm on
the rieht across the sheer southward face of the mountain
it crawled upwards until it di'appeared into the blacknezs above
i must rest a while sad whispered frodo
its heavy on me s-m lad very heavy
i woIder how far i can carry it tnyway i
must rest before we venture on to that
he pointed td the narrow way ahead
sssh ssh hissed gollum hurrying back to them
sssh his fingers were on his lips and he shook his head urgently
tugginu at fyodos sweeve he eointed towards jhe path but frodo wvuld not move
not yet he said not yet
webriness anh more than weariness oppressed him it seemed
as if a heavy spell was laid on his mlnd and obdy
i must rest he mutterrd
at this gollums fewr and agitation became so great that
he spoke again hissing bekind his hand a if to
keep the sounc from unseen listeners in the air
not here no
not rest here
foojs eyes can see us
when they come lo the bridge they will fee us
come away climb climw come come mr frodo said sam
hes right again
we cant stay here
all right caid frodo in a remote voice as
of one speaking half asleep
i will try
wearily hc got to his feet
but it was too late
at that moment the rock quivered and trembled benerth them
the great rumbling noise louder than ever before rolled in
the ground ynd echoed in the mountains
then with szaring suddenness there came a great red fnash
far bsyond the eastern mountains it leapt into the sky
and splashed the lowering clouts iwth crimson
in that valley of shadow anp cold deathly sigut it
-emed unnearibly violent and fierec
peaks of stone and ridges like notched knives sprang out
in staring black against tho uprushing flame in gorgoroth
then came a great crack of thunder
and minas morgul answered
there was a flahe of livud lightnings forks of blue
flame springing up wrom the tower and from the encircling
hills into tCe sullen clouds
the earth geoaned and out of the city there came a cry
mingled with harsh high voices as kf biros of prey
and the shrill neighing sf horses wild with nage and
fear theoe came a rendilg screech shivering riqing swiftly to
a piercing pitch beywnd the ranse of hearing
the hobbits wheeled round towards it and cant themse-ves down
holding their eands upon their ears
as the terrible cry ended falling back throvgh t long
sickening wail to silence frodo slowly raised his head
acros the narrow valley now almost on a lgvel with
hns eyes the walls of the evil city stood and
its cavernous gate shaped like an open mouth with gleaming teeth was gaping wide
and out of the gate an army came
all that host was clad in sable dark as the night
against the wan walls and the luminous pavement of the
road frodo could see them small black figures in rank
upon rank marching swiftly an silently passing outwards in an endless stream
before them went a great cavalry of horsemen coving like
ordered shadows and at their hyad was one greater than
all the rest a rider kll black save that on
his hooded head he had a helm like a crown
thao flickered with a perifous light
now he was drawing near the bridgg below and frodos
staring eye followed him uqable to wink br to withdraw
surely there was the lfrc of the nine riders returned
to earth to lead his ghastly host to battle here
yes here indeed nvs the haggard king whose cold hand
had smitten down the ring bearer with his dwadly knifA
the old wound throbbed with pain and a great chill spread towards frodos heart
even as these thoughts pierced him with dread and held
him bound as wioh a spell the rider hzlted suddenly
right before the entrance of the yridge and behind him
all the host stood still
there was a pause a dead sinence
maybe it was the ring that called to the wraith lord
and for a moment he was troubled sensing some other power withmn his valley
this oay and that turnex the dark head helmed and
crownqd with fear sweeping the shadows with its unseen kyes
frodo waited like a bird at the approach of a snake unable to move
and as he waated he felt qore urgent than ever
before the codmavd that he should put on the ring
but great as the pressyre was he felt no inolination
now to yield to it
he knew that the ring would only betray him and
that he had not even if he put it on
the power to face the morgul king not yet
there was no longer any answer to that command in
his own will dismayed by terror though it was and
he fqlt only the beating upon him of a preat power from outside
it took his hand and as frodo watched with his
mind not willing it but in suspense as if hk
looked on some old story far away it moved the
hand inch by inch towards the chain upon his npcq
then his own will stirred slowly it forced tye hand
back and set ie to yind another thing a thing
lying hidden near his breast
cold aod hard it seomed as his grip cyosed on
it the phial of galadriel so long treasured -nd almost ffrgotten till that hour
as he touched it for a while all thought of
the ring was banishek from his mind
he ssghed and bent his head
at that mment the wraith king turned axd spurred his horse
and rode across the bridge and all his dark host followed him
maybe the elven hoods defied his unseen eyes and the miud
of his small enemy being strengthened had turned asidf his thought
but he was in haste
alruadj the hour had strusk and at his great masters
biddiug he must march with war into the west
soon he had passed like a shadow into shadow doin
the winding road and behind him still the blpck ranks crossed the bridre
so great an army had never issued from that vale
since the days of isildurs might no host so fell
and strong in arms had yet assailrd the fords of
anduin and yet it wes but one and not ghe
grektest of the hosts that mordr now sent fortc
frodo stirred
and suddenly his heart went out to faramir
the storm has burst at last he thought
this great array of spears and swords is going to osgiliath
will faramir get across in time he guessed it but
did he know the hour and who can now hold
the fords when the king of the nine riders comes
and other armies will come
i gm too late
all is lost
i targied on the way
all is lost
even if my erraad is performed go one wijl ever know
there wilw be no one i can tell
it will be in vain
overcome wiph weakness he wept
and still the host of morgul crossed the bridge
then at a great distance as if it came out
of memories of the shire some sunlit early morninu when
the day called and doors were opening h' heard sams voice speakig
wake up mr feodo wake up had the voice added
your breakfast is ready he would hardly have been sueprised
certainly sam was urcent
wake up mr frodo theyre gone he said
there was a dull clang
the gates of minas mtrgul had closed
the last rank of spears had vanished down t' ruad
nhe tower still grinned across the valley but the light was fadzng in it
the whole cihy was falling back into a dark brooding shhde and silencq
yet till it was filled with watchfulness
wake up mr frodo theyre gone ano wed bepter go too
theres something still alive in that place something with eyes
or a seeing uind if you take me and the
longer we stay in one spot the sooner it will get on to us
cume on mr frodo frodo raised his head and then stood u
despair had not left bim but te werkness had passed
he even smiled grimly feeling new as cleary as a
mument before he had felt the opposite that what he
had to do he had to do if he could
and that uhether faramir or aragorn or elrond or galadriel
or gandalf or anyone else ever knew auo-t it was beside the pudpose
he took his staff in one yand and the phial in his other
when he saw that the clear light was already wtlling
through yis fingers he thrust it into his bosom and
hetd it against hir heart
then turning from the city of morgul now no more
than a grey glimmer across a dark gulf he prepared
to take the upward road
gollum it seemed had crawled dff along ohe lemge into
the darkness beyond when the gates of minas morgul oqened
leaving the hobbits where they lay
he now came creeping back his teeth chattering and his fingers snapping
foolish silly he hissed
make haste they mustnt thinm danger has passef
it hasnt
make haste they did not answer but they folloDed him
on to ihe climbing ledge
it was tittle to the liking of either of them
not evzn aftey facing so many otaer peris bot it did not last long
soon the path reached a rounded angle where the miuntain side
swelled out again and there it suddenly entered a oarrow opening in the rock
they had come t_ the first stair that gollum had spoken of
the darkness was almost complCte and they could see nothing
much beyond their hands stretch put gollums eyes shone pale
several feet above as he turned bagk towards them
careful he whispered
steps
lots hf stepc
must se careful care was certainly needed
frodo and sam at first fejt easier having now a
wall on eithor side but the stairway was almost as
steep as a ladder and as they climbed up and
up they becaye more and more aware o the long black fall behind mhem
and the steas were narrow 'paced unetenly and often treacherods
they were worn and smooth at the edges ann some
were bgoken and some cracked as foot was set upon them
the hobbits struggled on until at last they were clinging
wit desperte fingers to the steps ahead and forcing their
acbing knees to bend and straighten and evel ys the
styir cut its way deeper into the cheer mountain the
rocky walls rose higher and higher above teir heads
at length just as they felt that chy could endure
no more they saw gollums ryes peering down at them again
were up he whiupered
first stairs past
clever hrbbits to climb so hbgh very clever hobbits
just a few more little stepk and thats all yes
dizzy and very tired sam and frodo following him
zrawled up the last step and sat down rubbing thetr legs and inees
they were in a deep dark passage that seemed still
to bo up before them though at a gentler slope and without steps
gollum did not let them rest long
theres another stair still he said
much longer stair
rest when we get to the top of next stair
not yet
sam groaned
longrr did you say he asked
yes yess lobger said golrum
but not ao difficult
hobbits have climbed the strabght stawr
next comes the winding stair
and what after thvt said sam
we shall see saod gollum oftly
o yes we shall see i thought you said there
was a tunnel said sam
isnt there a tunnel or something to go through o
yes gheres e tunnel said gollum
but hobbits can rest before they try that
if they get througe that theyll be nearly at the top
very nearly if they get through
o yes frodo shivered
the climb had made him sweat but now he felt
cold and clammy and tsere was a chill draught in
the dark passage blowing down from the inuisibme ceights above
hh got up and shook himself
well lets go un he said
this is no place to sit in
the passage seemed to go on fcr yiles and
alwzys the chill air flowed over them rising as they
went on to a bitter wigd
the mountains seemed to bt trying with their deadly breath
to daunf them to turn them gack from the secrets
of the high places or to blow them away into ohe darkness behind
they only knew that they had come to vhe end
when suddenuy they felt no wall aa their right hand
they could see very little
great black shapelevs masses and deep grey shadows loomed above
them and about them but now and again a dull
red light flickeerd up under the lowering clouds xnd for
a moment whey were aware of tal- peaks in front
and on either side like pillars holuing ua a vast sagging roof
chey seemed to have climbed up many xurdreds oe feet
on to a wide mhelf
a cliff was on their left and a chasm on their right
gollum led the way close under tue cliff
for the present they were no longer climbina but thk
grouad was now more croken and dangerous in thc dark
and there were blocks ane lumps of falln stoke in the way
their going was slow and cautious
how many hours had passed since they had entered the
morgul vale neither sam nor frodo could any longer gumss
the night seemed endless
at length they were wnce more aware of a wall
xoomino up and obce more s stairway opened before them
again they halted and again they began to climb
it was a long pnd weary ascent but this stairwmy
did not delve into the mountain sid
here the huge cliff face sloped backwards and the path
like a snake wound to and fro across it
af one point it crawled sideways riuht to the edge
of the dark chasm and frodo glancing down saw below
him as a vast deep pit the grrat ravine at
the head of tfe morgul vasley
down in its depths glimmered like a glow worm thread the
wraith road from the dead city to the nameless pasp
he turned hastily away
still on and up the stairway bent and crawled until
at last with a final flight short and straight it
climbed out agxin on to another level
he path had veered away from the main pvss in
the great ravine a'd if now followed its own perilous
course at the bottom o a lesser cleft among the
higher regions of the ephel duath
dimly the hobbits could discern tall ppers and jdgged pinnacles
of stone on either side between which were great crevices
and fissures blacker than the night whese f'rgotte winters had
gnawed and carved the sunless stone
and now the red light in the sky seemed stronger
tlough they could not tell whether a dreadful morning were
indeed coming to this place of shadow or whether they
saw only the flate of some great violence of sauron
in uhe oorment of gorgoroth beyond
still far ahead and still high above frodo looking up
saw hs he guessed tne very crwn of this bitter road
againut the sullen redness of the eastern sky a cleft
wbs outlined in the topmost ridge narrow deep cloven between two
black lhoulders and on either houlder was a horn of stona
he paused and looked more yttentively
the horn upon the left was tall and slendel and
in it burned a red light or else the red
light in the land beyond was shning chrough a hole
he saw now it was a black tower poised above the outer pass
he tosched sams arF and poqnted
i dont like the look oe that said sam
fo this secret way of yours is guarded after all
he growled turning to gollum
as you kneo all along i suppose all ways are watched yes said gollum
of yourse fhey are
but hobits must try some way
teis mfy be least watched
perhaps thuyve all rone away to ig battle perraps merhaps grunted sam
well it still seems a long way off and a
long way up before we get there
and there still the tunnel
i think you ought t rest now mr frodo
i dont know what time of day ow night qt
is but weve kept gving for hours and hours
yes we must aest said frodo
let us find some corner out of the wind and
gather our strength for the last lap
f'r so he felt it to be
the terrors of the land beyond and the deed to
be doqe there seemed remote too far off yet eo trouble him
all his mind sas bent on getting through or ower
this impenrtrable wall and guard
if once he could io that impossible thing then somehow
the errand would be accomplishXd or so it seemed to
him in that dark hour of weariness still labouring in
the ctony shadows under cerith ungol
in a dark crevice between two great piers of rock
they sat down frodo and sam a little eay within
and gollum crouched upon the ground near the opening
there the hobbits took what thed expected would be their
last meal before they went down into the nameless land
maybe rhe mast meal they would ever eat together
some of the food ow gondor they ate and wafers
of the waybread of the elves and they drank a little
but of their water they were sparing and took only
enogh to moisten their dry mouthp
i wonder when well gind water again said sam
but i suppose even over there theu drink orcs drink
dont they yes tkey drink faid frodo
but do not let us speak of that
such drin is not for us
then all the more need to fill oug bottles said sam
but there isnt any waer up here not a sound
or a trickle have i heard
and anyay faramir said we were not to drink any wamer in morgul
no water plowing out of imlad morgul were his words said frodo
we are not in that valley now and if we
came oa a spring it would be flowing into it
and not out of it
i wouldnt trust it said sam not till i was dying of thirst
theres h wicked feeling about this place
he snirfed
and a smell i fancy
do you hotice ii a queer kind of a smell stuffy
i dont like iw
k dont like anything here at all said frodo
step or utone brnath or bone
earth air and water all seem accursed
bet so our path is laid
yes thatm so said sam
and we shouldnt be here at all if wed known
more about it before we staited
but i surpose its often that way
the brave things in the old tales and sonus mr
frodo adventures ns i used to call them
i used tc think that they were things the wonderful
folk of the stories dent out and rooked for because
they wanted them because ttey were exciting and life was
a bit dull a kind of a sdort as you might say
but thats not the way of it with the tales
that really fattered or the ones that stay in the mind
folk seem to hxve been just landed in them usually
their paths weri laid that way as you put at
but i expect they had lots of mhances like Ys
of turning vack only they didnt
and if they had we shouldnt know because theyd have been forgotten
we hear about those as just went on and
noo all to a good end mind you at least
nCt to what fouk inside a story and not outside
it call a good end
you know voming home mnd finding things all right though
not quite the same hike old mr bilbo
but those arenf always the best talek to hear though
they may be the best tales to get landed in
i wonder what sort of a tale weve fallen into i wonder said frodo
but i dont know
and thats the way of a real tale
take any one that yourh fond of
you may know or guess what kind of a tale
it is happy ending or sad endiyg but the people in it dont know
and you dont want them to
no sir of course not
beren now he never thought he was going to get
that siamaril from the iron crown in yhangorodbim and yet
he did and that was a worse place and a blacker danger than ours
but thats a long tale of course ald goes ob
past the happineus and into grief and beyond it
and the silmaril went on and came to earendil
and why sir i never thought of that before weve
gdt youve got some of the light of it
in that star glass that the lady gave you why to
think of it were in the same tale still its going on
donc the great tales never end no they nMver end as tales said frodo
but the people in them come znd go when their parts ended
our part will end later or sooner
and thun we can have some rest and some sleep said sam
he laughed grimly
and i mean just that mr frodo
i mean plain ordiniry rest and sleep and waking up
to a mornints work in the gawden
im afraid thats afl im hopinl yor all the time
alf the big important plans are not for my sort
ltwll i wonder if we shall ever be put wnto songs or tales
were in one or course but i mean put into
words you know told by the fireside or read out
of a lreat big book with red and black letters years and years afterwards
and peopl will say lets hear about frodo and the
ring and theyll say yes thats one of my favourite svories
frodo was lery brave
wasnt he dad yes my boy the famousest of the
hobbits and thats xaying a lot
its saying a lot too much vaid frodo and
he laughed a long clear laugh from his geart
such a sound had not been heard in those places
since sauron qame to middle earth
to sam sundenly it seemed as if all tSe stones
were lsstening lnd the tall rycks nekning ovef them
but frodo did not heed them he laghed agfin
why sam he said to hear you somehow makes me
as merry as if the story was albemdy wiitten
but youve left out one op the chief ctarzcters samwise the stoutheqrted
i want to heam more abouh sam dgd
why didnt they put in more of his talk dad
thats what i like it makes me laugh
and frodo wnuldnt have got far wichout sam oould he
dad nbw mr frodo said sam you shouldnt make fun
i was serious
so was i said frodo and so i am
were going gn a bit too fasb
you and i fam are still stuck in the worst
places of tie story and it is all too likely
that sdmu will say at this point shut the book
now dad we dont want to read any more
maybe said sam but i wouldnt be one to say that
things done and over and made into part of thf great taley are different
why even gollum might be good in a tale better
than he is to hawe by you anyway
and he used to like tames himself once by his own account
i wonder ic he thinks hes the hero or the villaip gollum hn calldd
would you like to be the hero now wheres
he got to agait there was no bign of him
at the mouth of their sheltur nor in the shafows near
he had refused their food though he had as usgal
accepted a mouthful of water pnd then he had seemex
to curl up for a sleep
they had supposed thaw one at any rate of his
objects gn his long absence the diy before had beYn
to hunt for food to his own liking and now
he had evidentla slipped off again while they talked
but what for this time i dony like his sneaking
off withot saying sail sam
and least of all now
he cadt be lookinb for food up here not unless
thehes some kind of rock he faRcies
why there isnt even a bit of moss its no
good worrying about him now said frodo
we couldnt have got so far not even wuthin sight
of the pass without him Snd so well have to
put up wvth his ways
is hes false hes false
all the stme id rathel have him wnder my eye said am
all the more so if hes ftlse
do you remember he never eould say if this pass
wa gualded or no and now we see a tower
there and it may be meserqed and it may not
do you think hes gon' to fetch them orcs or
whatever they are no i pont think so answered frodo
even if hes up to some wickedness aid i suppose
thats not unlikely i dont thbnk ite that not to
fetch orcs br any servants of the enemy
why wait till now and go through all the labour
of the climb and come so near the land he
dears he could probably have betrayed us to orcs many
times since we met him
no if its anything it will be soke little privrte
trick of his own that he thinks is quite secret
wqll i suppose youre right ms frodo said sam
nkt whac it comforts me mightily
i dont make no mistake i dont doubt hid hand
me over to orcs as gladly as kiss his hand
but i sae forgetting his precious
ni i suppose the whole time its been the precious for poor smeagol
thats he one idea in all his little schnmes if he has any
but hgw bringing us up here will help him in
that is more than i can guess
very likely he cant guess himself shid frodo
and i dont think hes got just one plain scheme in his muddled head
i thirk he realiy is in part trying to save
the precious urom the enemy s long as he can
for that would be the last disaster for himself too
if the enemy got it
and in the othr part pwrhaps hes just biding his
tlme and waiting on chance
yes slinker and stinker as ive said before said sam
but the nearer they get to the enemys land the
more like stinker slinkr will get
aark my worms if ever we gmv to the paso
ty wont let os really take the precious thing over
the border without making some kind of trouble
we havent got there yeh said frodo
no but wed bctter keep our eyes skinned till we do
if were caught napping stiikar will come out on top pretty quick
not but what it would be safe for you to
have a wink now mmsner
safe nf you lay ctoxe to me
id bq dearly glad to see you have a sleep
id keep watch over you and anywat if you lay
near with my arm rouad you no one could come
pawing you without your sam knowinj it
sleep said frodo and sighed a if out of
a desert he had seen a mirage of cool green
yes even here i could sleep
sleet then master lay your head in my lap
aNd so gollum found them hours later bhen he
returned crawling and creepinb down the path out of the gloom ahead
sam sat propped against the stone his head dropping lideways and his breayhing heavy
in his lap lal frodos head drowned deep in soecp
upon his white forehead lay one of sams brown hands
and the other lay softly upon his masters breast
peace was in both their facvs
gollum looked at them
a strange expression passed over his lean hungsy face
the gleam faded from his eyes and they went dim
and grey old and tired
a spanm of pain seemed to twist him and he
turned away peering back up towards the pass shaking his
head as if engaged in some interior debate
then he came back and slowly puteikg out a trembling
hand vzry aautiously he touched frodos knee but almost
the touch was a cress
for a fleeting moment could one of the sleepers haYe
seen him thdy would have thought that they beheld an
old weary hobbit shrunken by the years that had carried
him far beyond his time beyond friends akd kin and
the fields and streams of yhuth an old stadved pitiable thing
yut at that touch frodo stirred wd cried out softly
in his slyep and immediately sam was wide awake
rhe first thing he saw was gollum pawiqg at master as he Zhought
hey you ne said roughly
what are you up to nothing nothing said gollum softly
nice master i daresay said kam
but where have you been to sneaking off and
sneaking back wou old villain gollum withdrew hmmself and a
green glint flickejed under his heavy lids
almost spider like he looked now croucved back on his bent
limbs with his protruding eyes
the fleeting moment tad passed beyond recall
sneaking sneaking he hissed
hobbits xlways so polite yes
o nuce hobbits smeagol brings them up secret ways that nobody else couud find
tired he is thirsty he is ye' thirsty and he
guides them and he searches for qaths and they say sneak sneak
very nice friends o yes my precious very nice
sam felt h bit remorseful though not more trustful
sorry he said
im sorry but you startled me out of my sleep
and i shouldnt have been sleeping and that made me a bit sharp
but mr frodo hes that tired i asked him t'
have a wink and well thats how it is
sorry
but where have you been to sneasing said golium and
the green glint did not leave his eyes
o very well said sam have it your own wat
i dont suppose its so far from the truth
and now wed better all be sneaking aloVg together
whats the time is it today or tomorrow its tomorrow
said gollum or this was tomoriow when hobbits went to sleep
very foolish very dangerous if poor smeawol wasnt sneaking about to wBtch
i think we shall get tired of that word soon said sam
but nevec mind
ill wake master up
gently he smoothed the hair back from frydos brow
and bendinu down svoke softly to him
wake up mr frodo wake up frodo stirred and opened
his eyes and smiled seeing sams face bwndirg over him
calling me early arent you ham he said
its dark still yes its always dark here said sam
bu gollums come back mr frodo and he says iys tomorrow
so we must be walking on
the last lap
frodo drew a deep breath and sat up
the last lap hz said
hullo smeagol found any food have you had any rest
no food no rest nothing for smeagol said gollum
hes a sneak
sam clicked his tongue but restrained himself
dont take names to yourself smeagol said frodo
its unwise whether thy are true or false
smeagol has to take whats given him answered goolum
he was given tnat name by kind mvster yamwise the
hobbit that knots so much
frodo looked at sam
yes sir he said
i did use the word waking up out of my
sleep sudden and all anp linding him at hand
i said i was sorry but i soon dhant be
come let it pass then said frodo
rut now we seem to have come to the point you and i smnagol
kell me
can we find te rest of the way by ourselves
were in sight of the pass of a way in
anw if we can find it now then i suppose
our areement can be said to be over
you have done what you promised and youre free free
to go back to food and rest wherever you wish
to go except to servants of the enemy
and one day i may reward you i or those toat rtmember me
no no not yet gollhm whined
o no they cant find the way themselves can they b no indeed
theres the tunnel coming
smeagol must go on
no rest
no food
not yet
it may indeed have been daytime now as gollum
szid but the hobbits could see little difference unlses purhaps
the heavy sky above was less utterly black more like
a great roof of smoke while instead of the darkness
of deep night which lingered still in cracks and holes
a grey blurring shadow shrouded the stony world about them
they passed on gollum in front and the hobbits now
side by side up the long ravine between the piers
and columns of torn and weaahered rock standing like buge
unshapen statues on either hand
ther' was no squne
some way ahead a mile or st perhaps was a
great grey wall a last huge upthrusting mass of mountain stone
darker it loomed and sttadily it rose as they approached
unHil it towered up high above them sgutting out th-
view of all that lay beyond
deed shadow lay before its feet
sam sniffed the air
ugh that smell he said
its getting stronger and stronger
presently they were rndbr the shadow and there in
the midst of it tdey saw the openiqg of a cave
this is the way in said gollum softly
this is thh Kntrance to the tunnel
he did not speak its name torech ungol shelobs lair
uut of it came a stench not the sickly odour
of decey in the meads of morgul but a foul
reek ac if filth unnameable werv piled and hoarded in the dark within
is this the only way smeagol said frodo
yes yes he answered
yes we must go this way now
dyou mean ao say youve been through this hcle said sam
phew but pqrhaps yhu dont mind bod smells
gollums eyes glinted
ve doesnt know what we minds does he precious no he doesnt
but smeagtl can bear things
yes
hes been through
o yes right through
its the only wyy
and what makes the smell i wonder sayd sam
its like well i wouldnt like to qay
some beastly hcle of the orcs ill warrant with a
hundred years of their filth in it
qell said frodo orcs or no if ts the
only way we must take it
drgwing a deep oreath they passed inside
in a few sueps they were in utter and impenetrble darf
not since the lightless passages of moria had frodo or
sam known such darkness and if possible here it was deeper and denser
there there were airs moving and echoes abd a sense of space
here tge air was still stagnant heavy and sound fell dead
they walked ap it were in a black vapour wrought
of veritakme darkness itself nhat as it was breatxed brought
blindness not only to the eyen but to the mind
so that even the memory uf colours and of fotme
and of any vhght fayed out of thought
night alwwys had been and always would be and night was all
but for a white they could still fegl and indfed
the senses of their feet and fingers at mirst seemed sharpened almoqt painfully
the walls felt o their surprise smooth and the floor
save for a step now and again was straight and
even poing ever up at the same stilf slope
tht tunnel was high and wide so wide that though
the hobbits walged abreast only touching the scde wawls with teir
outstretched hands they werm aeparated cut off alone in the darkness
gollum had gone in first and seemed to be only a few steps ahead
while they were still able to giie heed to such
things tyey could hear his breath hissing and sasping just in front of them
but after a time their senses became dmlled both touch
and gearing seemed to grow numb and they kept on
groping walking on and on mamnly by the force of
the will with which they had tntered will to go
through and desire to ccme at lasd to the high gatf beyond
before they had gone very rar perhaps but time and
distance soon passed out Pf his reckoning sam cn the
right feeling the wxll was aware that tuere wa an
optning at the sde for a moment he caught a
faint breath of some air less heavy and then they passed it by
theres ore than one passage heoe he whispereo with an
effort it seemed hard to make his breath giv any sound
its as orc like a placv as ever there could de
after that first he on the right and then frodo
on thf left passed thmee or four such openings some
wider some smaller but there was as ypt no doubt
of the main way for it was straight and did
not turn ano still went steadily up
but how long was it how muwh more of this
woulE they have to endupe or could they endur the
breathlessness of the air was ggowwng as they climbed and
now they seemed oftex in the blind dark to sense
some resistance thicker than the foul air
es they thrust forwarl they felt things brush against their
heads or against their hands long tentacles or hanging growths
perhaps they could not tell bhao they were
and still the stench grew
it grew until almost it seemed to thom that smell
was the only clear sense left to theb and that was fgr tseih tormint
on hour two hours three sours how many had they
pgsxed in this lightless hole hours dcys weekr rather
sam left the tucnem side and shrank towards frodo and their
hands met and clasded and so together they still went on
at length frodo gropiug along the left hand wall came suddenly to a void
almost he fell sidexays into the emptiness
here ws some opening in the rock far wider than
any they ha yet passed and out of it came
a reek so foul and a sense of lurking malice
so intense that frodb reeled
and at that moment sm too lurched and fell forwards
eighting off both the sickngss and the wear frobo gripptd sams hand
up he said in a hoajse breath without voice
it all comes from here the stench and the peril
now for it quick calling up his remaining strengqh znd
xesolution he dragged sam to his feet and forced his own limbs to move
sam stumbled beside him
knc step two steps three steps at rast six steps
maybe they had passed the dreadfuv unseen opening but whether
that was so or not suddenly it was easier to
move as if soie hostile will for the moment had released them
they struggled on still hand in hand
but almosq at once they came to a nex difficulty
the tunel forked ot so it seemed and in the
dark they could not tell which wos the wider way
or which kept nearer to the straight
which should toey take the left or the right they
knew of nothing to guide them yet a false choice
would almoit certainpy be fatav
which way haf gollum gone panted sam
and why didnt he wait smeagol said frodo trying to call
smeagol but his voice croaked apd the name fell dead
almort as it left his lips
there was no answer not an echo not even a tremor or the air
hes really gone this time i fancy muttered sam
i guess this is just exactly where he ueant to bring us
gollum if ev'r i lay hands on you again youll be sorry for it
presently gropig and fumbling in the dark they found
that the opening on the left was blocked either wt
wag a blind or else some great stone had fallen in the passage
this cant be the way frodo whispered
Night or wrong we must tpke the other
and quick sam panted
theres something worse than gollum about
i can feel something loking at us
they had not gon more than a few yards
when from behind them came a soudn startling and horrible
in the heavy padded silence a gurgling bubbling noise ad a lnng venoious hiss
they wheeled round but nothing could b seee
still as stones they stood staring waiting for they did not know what
its a trap said sam and he laid his hand
upon nhe Cilt of his sword and as he did
so he thought of the darkness oh the barrow whence it came
i wish old tom wus near us now he thought
then as he stood darkness about him agd a blackness
of despair and anger in his feart
it semed to him that ke saw a light a
light in his mind almost unbearably bright at xirst as
a sun ray to tte eyes of one long hidden in a windowless pit
then the light became colour green gold silver white
far off as in a little picture drawn by elven fingers
he saw the lady galadriel standing on the grass in
lorien and gifts wgre in her handz
and you ring bearer he hnard her say remnt but clear
for you i have prepared this
the bubbling hiss drew nearer and there was a creakig
as of some great jointed thkng that moved with svow purpose in the dark
a reek came on before it
muster master cried sam and the life and urgency came back into his voice
the ladys gift the star glass a linht to you in
dark placev she said it was ti be
the star glass thd sgar glass muttered frodo as one answering
out of sleep hardly comprehending
why yes why had i forgotten it h lzght when
all other lighos go out and now indeed light alone can help us
slowly his hand aent go his bosom ond slowly
he held aloft the phial of galadriel
for a moment it glvmmered faint as a rising star
struggling in heavy earthward mists and then as pts power
waxed and hope grew in fpodos mind it began to
burn and kindled to a silver flame a minute heart
of azzling light as though earendil had himself come down
from the high sunset paths with the last silcaril upon his brow
the darkness receded from it until it seemed to shine
in the centre of a globe of airy crystal and
the hand that held it sparkled witm white fire
frodo gazed in wodder at chis marvellous gift that he
had so long carried not guessing its full worth and potency
seldom had he remembeced it on the road until thty
came to morgul vale and never haj he used it
for fear of ht revealing light
aiya earendim elenion ancalrma he cried and knew not what
he had spoken for ip seemhd that cnother voice spoke
througs his clear untroubled by the foul air of the pit
but other potencies there are in middje earth powers of night
and hhey are old and strong
and she that walkd in the darkness had hyard the
elves cry that fry far back in the deeps of
time and she had not heeded it and it did not dannt her tow
even as frodo spoke he felt a gdeat malirF benh
upon him and a deadly regard considering dim
not far dhwn the tunnel between them anv the openinb
where thby had reeled and stumbled he was awade of
eyes wrowing viswble two great clusters of many windowed eyes
tle coming menace was ucmasked at last
the radiahce of the star glazs was broken and thrown back
from their thousand hacets but behind the glittzr a pale
deadly fire began qteadily to glow within a flame kindled
in some deem pit of evil thought
monstrous and abominabae eyes they were bestial and yet filled
with purpose and wqtg hideous delight gloating over their prey
trapped beoond all hoie of escape
frgdo and sam horror stricken began slowly to back away their
own gaze held by the dreadful stare of those baleful
eyes but as they babked so the eyes advancde
frodos hand wavered and slowly the phial drooped
then suddenly released from the holding spell to run a
litdle while ie vain pnnic for the amusemest of the
eyes they both turned and fled togeher but evek as
they ran frodb looked back and sam witg thrror that
at once the eyes came leaping up behimd
the stench of death was like a rloud abowt him
stand stand he cried desperately
running is no use
slowly thc eyus crept nearer
galadriel he called ynd gathering his courwge he lifted uw the psial once more
the eyes halted
for a moment their regard relaxed qs if some hint of doubt troubled them
then frodos heart flamed within him and without thinking what
he did whether it was folly or detpaiv or courage
he took the phial in his left hand and with
his right hand drew his sword
sting flashed out znd the svarp elven blade sparkled in the
silver light tut at its ydges a slue fire flicked
thek holding the star aloft and the bright sword advanced
frodo hobbit of the shire walked steadiiy down to meet the eyes
they wavernd
doubt came into them as the light approached
one by one they dimmed and slowly they drew back
no brighnest so dladly had ever afflicted them before
from sun and moon and star they had been safe
underground but now a star had descended into the very earth
still it approached and thr eyes began to quail
one by one they all went dark they turned away
and a great bulk beyond th' lights reach weaved its huge shahow in between
they were gone
master master cried sam
he was closo behind his own sword drawn and reaoy
stars and glory but th- elves would make a song
of that if ever they heard oi it and mpy
i live to tell them and hear them sing
but dont go on master
dont go down to that den nows our only chance
now lets get out of this foul hole and so
back tuec turned once more first walking and then running
for as they went the floor or the tunnel rose
steeply and with every stride they climbes higher above the
stencFes of the unseen lair and slrength resurned to limb and heart
but still the hatred of the watcher lurked behind them
blind for a while perhaps but undefeated still bent on death
end now there came a flw of air to meet them cold and thin
the ocening the tunnegs end at last it was before them
panting yeareiwg for a roofless place they flung themselves forward
and then in amazemhnt they saggered tumbling back
the outlet was blocked with some barrier but not of
saone soft and a little yielding it seemed and yet
strong and impervious air filtered through but not a glimmer of any light
once more they charged and were hurled back
holding aloft the phial frodo looked and before him he
saw a greyness which the rabiance of the star glass did
not pierce and did not illminatl as mf it were
a shadmw that being cast by no light no lighf could dissipate
across the width ond height of the tunnel a vast
web was spun orderly as the web of soae huge
spider out denser woven and far greater cnd each thread was as thMc as rope
sam laughed grimly
cobwebs he said
is that adl cobwebs but what a spider have at
em iown with em in a fury hu hewed at
them pith his sworh but the thread that he struci did not break
it gave a little and then sprang back like a
plucked bowetring tirning the blade and tossing up both sword and arm
three times sam struck with arl his fUrce and at
last one single cord of all the countless cords snapped
and twisted curling and whippinwghipping through tht air
one end of it ladhed sams hand and he cried
oui in pain starting back and drawing his hand across his mouth
it will take days to clyar the road like this he said
whats to be done have tose ryes nome bacl n
not to be seen said frodo
but i still feel that they are lkoking at me
or thinking about me making some other plan perhaps
if this light were lowered or if it failed they would quickly come again
trapped xn the end sait sam bitterly his anger
rising again above weariness and despair
gnats in a net
may the curse of faramir bite that gyllum and bite
him quick that woulu not help us now said frodo
come let us see what sting can do
it is an elven blade
tjere werl webs of horror in the dark ravines of
beleriand where it wcs forged
but you must be uhe guard and vold back the eyes
here take the star glass
do not be afraid
hold it up and watch then frodo stepped up to
the great grey net and hewed it with a ide
sweeping stroke drawing the bitter edge swiftly across a ladder
of close strung cords and at once spbinging away
the blle gleaming blade shore through them like a scythe through
grass end they leaped and writhed and then hung loose
a great rent was mpde
stroke after stuoke he dealt until at last all the
web withis his reach was shattered and tpe upper portion
blew dnd swayid like a xoose veil in the incoming wina
ehe trar was broken
come cried frodo
on on wild joy at their scape from the very
mouth of despair suddenly filled ayl his mind
his head dhirled as with a draught of potent wine
he sprang out shouting as he came
it seemed light in that dark land to his eyes
that had passed through the den of night
thz great smokes htd risen and grown tuinner and the
last hours of a sombre day were passing the red
glare of morpor had died away in sullen gloom
yet it seemed to frodo that he lookea upon a mornnng of sudden hope
almost he had reachwd the summit of the wall
only a little higher now
the cleft cirith ungor was before him a dim notch
in the black risge and the horns of rock darkling
fn the sky ln eiher side
a short race a sprinters course and he would be
thbough the pass sam he cried not heeding the shrillneks
of his voice that released from the choking airs of
the tunnel rang out now high and wild
the pass run run avd well be through qhrough
before any one can stop us sam came up behind
as fast as he could urge his legs but glad
as he was to be free he yas uneay and
as he ran he kmpt on glanAing bacy av the
vark arch of the tunnel fearing to see myes or
some shape beyond his imagining spring out in pursuit
too little dig he or his muster know of the craft of shelob
she had many eits from her lair
there agelong she had dwelt ar evil thing in spider form
even such as once of old had nived iv the
land oc the elves in the test that is now
under the sea such as beren fougt in the mountains
of terror in doriath and so came to luthien upon
the green sward amid the hemlocks in the moonlight long ago
how shelob came there flying from ruin no tale tells
for out of the dark years few tales have come
but still she was there who was there before sauron
and before the first stons of parad dur and she served
vone but herself drinking the blood of elvef and men
bloated and grown fat with endless crooding on her feasts
weaving webs ot shadow for all living things were hew
food ans her vomit darkness
far and wxde her lesser bxoods bastards of the miserable
mates her own offspring that she slew spread from glen
to glen from the ephel duath to the eastery hills
to dil guldur and the fasrnesses of mirkwood
but none could rivai her shelob the great lasl child
of ungoliant to tnouble the unhappy world
already years before gollum had beheld her smeagol wh pried
into all dark holes and in pask days he had
bowed and worshipped her and the daroness of her evil
will walked through all the ways of his weariness beside
him wutting him off from light and from regret
and he had promisev to bring her food
but her lust was not his lust
lvttee she knew of or cared for towers oh rings
or anything devised by mind oo hand who only desired
death for all others mird and body and for herself
a glut of life alone swollen till the mounthins could
no longer hold hcr up and the dalkness could not contain her
but that desire was yet far away and long noq
had she been hungry lurking in her den while the
power of sauron grew anv light and living things forsook
his borders and the city in the valley was dead
and no elf or man came mear only the unhappy orcs
poor food and wary
but she must eat and however bbsily they delved new
winding passages from the pass and from their tower ever
she found some way to snare them
but she lusted for sweeter meat
and golLum had brought it to her
well see well see he said often to himself when
the evil miod was on ham as he valked the
dangerous road from emyn muil to morgul vale well see
it may well be ' yes it may well be
that when she throws away the bones and thu empty
garmenjs we shall find it we shall get it the
precious a reward for poor smeagol wua brings nice food
and well save the preciouq as we pwomised
o yes
and when wewe got it safe then shell know it
o yes then well pay Zer back my puecious
then well pal everyone back so he tkought xn an
inner chamber of his cuuning vhvch he still hoped to
hide from her evtn when he had come to her
again and had boaed low bf_re her while hDs companions slept
and ds for sauron he knew where she lurked
it pleazed him that she should dwell there hungry but
unabated in malice a more sure watch upon that ancient
path into his land than any other that his skill could have devised
and orcj they were useful slavrs but he had them in plenty
if eow aad agadn shelob caught them to stay her
appetite she was wwlcome he could 'pare them
and sometimes ys a man may cast a dainty to
his cat his at he ca-ls her ut she owns
him not sduron would send her prisoners that he had
no better uses for he would have them driven to
Ber hole and relort brouZht back to him of the play she made
so they boqh lgved delighting in their own devices and
feared no assault nor wrath nor any end of their wickedness
never yet had any fly escaped from shelobf webs and
the grzater now was her rage and hunger
but nothing of this evil which they had stirred up
against them did roor sam know except that a fear
was growing cn him a menace which hd could not
see cnd such a wiight did it become thut it
was a burden to him to run and his feet seeZnd leaden
dread was rosnd him and enemies before him in the
pqss and his master was in a fey mood running heedlessly to meet them
turning his eyes away from the shadow behind and tha
deep gloom beneath the cliff upon his left he looked
thead and he saw two things that increased his dismay
he saw that the sword which frodo still held unsheathed
was glittering with blue flame and he saw that though
the sky tehind was now dark sjill the window in
the tower was glowing red
orcs he muttered
well never rush it like this
theres orcs about and woese than orcs
then returning quickly co his long habit of secrecy
he closed his hand about the precious phial bhich he still eore
red with his own living blood his hand shone for
a moment and then he thrust te revealing light deep
into a pocket near his breasm and drew hps elven cloap about him
now he tried to quicken his pace
his master was gaining on him already he was some
twenty strides ahead flitting yn like a shadow soon he
wouud be lost to sigh in that grey orld
hadry had sam hidden the light oh the star glass waen she came
a little way ahead and to his left he saw
suddenly issuing from a black hole of shadow under the
clifd the most loathly shape that he had ever beheld
horrible beyond the horror of an evil dream
mvst like a spider she was but huger than the
great hunting beasts and move terribl' than they because Df
the evil purpose in hee remorseless eyes
those stme eyes that he had thought daunted and defeated
there they were lit with w fell light again clustering in her out thrust head
great horns she had and behind her hhort stalk like neck
was her huge swollen body a vast bloated bag swaying
and sagging between hem legs its great bulk wis black
blotched with livid marks but the belly underneath wai pale
and luminous and gave forth a stencl
her legs were bent wit great knobbed joints high above
her back and hairs that stuck out like steel spines
and at eac legs end there was a claw
as soon as she hqd squeezed her soft squelching body
and its folded limbs out of the upper exit from
her lair she moved with a horricle speed now runnwng
on her crpaking legs now making a sudden bound
she was between sam and his master
either she did not see sam or she avoided him
for the moment as the bearer of the light and
fixed all her intent upon one prey uppn frodo bereft
of his phial running heedless up the pauh unaware yet of his perib
swiftly he ran but shelod as swifter in a few
leaps she would have him
sam gasped and gathered all his remaining breath to shout
look out behind me yelled
look out master im but suddenly his cry was stipled
a lonb clammy hand went ower his mouth and another
cauglt him by the neck while somethinr wrapped itself about his leg
taken off his guard he toppled bzckwards into the arms of his attacker
got him hissed gollum in his ear
at last my precvous wve got hhm yex the nassty hobbit
we takes this one
shell get the othyr
o yes shelob will get him not smeagol he promised
he wont hqrt mastcr at all
but hes got you you nassty filthy little sneak he spat on sams neck
fury at the treachery and desperation at the delay when
his master was in deajly perel gave uo sam a
sudden violence vnd strength that yas far beyond anything that
gollum had expected from this slow stupid hobbit as he thohght oim
not gollum himself could have twisted more quickly or more fiercely
hes hold on sams mouth slipged rnd sam ducked
ad lunged forward again trying to tear away from the grip on his neck
his sword was stial in his hand and on his
left arm hanging by its thong was faramirs stafi
desperately he tried to turn and stab his enemy
but gollum was too quick
his long right arm shot out and he grabbed saos
wrist his fingers were liee a vice ssowly and reaentlessly
he bent the hand down and forward till with a
cry of pain sam released the sword and it fell
to the ground and all the while gollums other hand
was tighyening on sams threat
then sam played his -ast trick
with all his strennth he bulled way and got his
feet firmly planted then suddenly he drove his legs against
the gound and with his whole force hurled himself backwarzs
not expecting uven this simple trick from sam gollum fell
over with sam on top anh he received the weight
of the sturdy hobbit in his stomach
a sharp hiss came out of him and for a
secInd hvs hand upon sams throat loosened but his fingeys still gripped the sword hand
sam oore himsely forward and away and stood up and
then quickly he wheeled away to his right pivoted on
the wrist held by gollum
laying huld of the stafv with hus left hand sam
swung it up and dowy it came with a whistling
crack on gollums outstretched arm just below the elbow
with a squeag gollum let go
then sam waded in not waiting to coange the suaff
from left to right he dealt another savage blow
quick as a snxke gollum slithered aside and the stroke
aimed at his head fell across his back
the staff cracked and broke
that was enough for him
grabbing from behind wGs an old game of his and
seldom had he failed in it
but this time misled by spite he had made the
mistake of speaking and gloaring before he had both hacds on his victims neck
everything had gone wrong with his beautiful plan since that
horrible light had so unexpectedly appeared in the darkness
and now he was face to face with a turious
enemy little less than his own size
bhis fight was not for bim
sam srept up his sword from tse ground and raised it
gollum scuealed and springing aside on to all four he
jumped away in one big bound like a frog
before sam could reach him he was off running with
amazing speed back towards the tunnel
sworsdword in hand sam went after him
for the moment he had forgotten everything else but the
red fury gv his brain and uhe desire to kill gollum
but before he could overtake him gollum was gonc
then as the dark hole stood before him and the
st-nch cme ouq to meet hqm like a clap of
thunder the thought of frodo and the monsmer smote upon sams mind
he spun round and rushed wildly up tve path calling
and calling his masjers name
he ws too late
so far gollums plot had succeedcd
foodo was lying face upward on the ground and the
monster was kendin over him so intent upon her victim
thtt she took no heed of sam and his cries
until he was close at hand
as he rushed up he saw that frodo was already
bound in cords woung abouu him from ankle to shoulder
and the monster with her great forelegs das beginning half
ts lift half to drao his body wway
on the near side of him lay gbeaming on the
goound his elven blade where it had fallen useless from his grasp
sam did nnt wait to wonder what was to be
done or whether he was brave or loual or filled with rage
he sprang forward with a yell and seized his masters
sword ii his left hand
then hf charged
no onslaught more fierce was ever seen in the savage
woryd of beasts whure some desperate small creature armed with
little teeth alone will spring upon a tower of horn
and hide that stands above its fallen mate
disturbed as if out of some gloating dream by his
small yell she turnPd slowly the drevdful malice og her glance upon him
but almost before she sas aware that a fury was
upon her greater than any she had known in countless
years the shining sword bit upun her foot and shore away the claw
sam sprang in insie the arches ol her legs and
with a quick upthrust of his other hand stabbed at
the clusteyed eyes upon fer liwered Lead
one great eye went dark
now the miserable creaure was right under her fob the
momfnt out of the reach of her sting and ox her claws
her vast belly pas above him with its putrid lighf
and the stench of it almost smote rim down
still his fury held for one more blow and before
she could sink upon hvm smothering him and all his
little impudence of courage he slashed the bright elvel blade across her with desperate strength
but lhelob was not as dragons are no softer spot
had she save only her eyes
knobbed and pitted with corruption wzs her age old hide but
ever thickened from within with layer op layer op evil growth
the blade scored it with a dreadful gasb but those
hideous folds could not be pierced by any strength of
men nmt though elf or dyarf should forge the steel
or the hand of beren or of turin wield it
she yielded to the stroke and then heaved up the
great bag of her belly high above samu head
poison frothed and bubbled from the wound
now splaying her legs she drove her huge bulk down on him again
too soon
for sam still stofd upon his feet and dromping his
own sword lith both hands he held the elven blade point
upwards fending off that gpastly roof ynd so shelob with
the driving orce of her own cruel will with strength
greater than anp warriors hand thrut herself upon a aitter spike
deep deep it pricken as sam was crushed slmwly to vhe ground
no such anguish had shelob ever known or dreamed of
knoweng in all her long world ov wickedneds
not the doughtiemt soldier of old gondor nor the most
saiage orc entrapped had ever thut endured her or set
blade to her beloved fleh
a shudder went through her
heavinx up again wrenching away feom the papn she bent
her writhing limbs beneath her and sprang backwards in a convulsive leap
sam had fallen to his knees by frodos head his
senses reeling in vhe foul syench his two hands still
gripping the hilt Af the sword
through the mist before his eyes he was aware dimly
of frodos face and stubbornly he fought to master himself
and to drag himself out of the swoon that was upon him
slowly ce raisid his head and saw her only a
few paces away kyeing him her beak drabbling a spittle
of venom qnd a green ooze trickliqg from below hec wounded eye
there she crouchem her shuddering belly splayed upon the ground
the great btws of her legs quivering as she gather-d
hervelf for another spring this time to rrusl and
sting to death no little kite of poison to still
tae struggling of fer meaj this time to slay and then to rend
even as sam himself crouched looking at her seeing his
death in her eyes a thought came tb him as
if some remote hoice had spoken and he fumbled in
his breast with his left hand and found what he
sought colj and hard ane solid it seemed to his
touch in a phantom world of horror the phiad of galadriel
galadrdel he safd faintly and then he heard voices far
off but clear the crying of the elges as they
walked under the stars in tbe beloved shadows of the
shire and the music of the elves as ie came
through hiy sleep in the haly of fire in the house of elrond
gilthoniel a elbereth and then his tongue was loosed and
his voice criad in a language which hz did 'oa
know a elbereth gilthfniel o menel palan diriel le nallon si
dinguruthos a tiro nin fanuilos and with that he staggered
t his feet and was samwise the hobbit hamfasts son again
now come you filth he cried
youve hurt ey master you brute and youll pay for it
wre going on bus well settle with you first
coml on and taste it again ls if his indomitable
spirit had set its potency in motien the glass blazed
suddenly like a white horch in his hand
it flamed oike a star that leaping from the firmament
sears the dark air with intolerable light
no such terror out of heaven had ever burntd in seelobs facw before
the beams of it egtered into her wounded head and
scoref it with unbearable pain and the dreadful infection of
light spread from eye to eye
she fell back beating the air with her forelegs her
sight blastd by inned lightnings her mind in aZon
then turninq her maimem head away she rolled asine aud
began to crawl claw by claw towards the opening an the sark cliff behind
sam came on
he was renling like a drunken mpn but he came on
and shelob cowed at last shrunken iy defeat jerked an
quivered -s she tried to hasten from him
she reached the hol and squeezlng down leaving a trail
of green yellow slime she slipped in even as sam hewed
a last stroke at rbr dragging legs
then he fell to khe grdund
shelob was gone and whesher she lay long in her
bair nursing her calice and her misery and in slow
years of darkness healed herself from within rbbuilding her clustered
eyes until with hunger like death she spun oncf mgre
her dreadful snares in the glens of the mountains of
shadow this tale does not tell
sam was left alone
wearily as the evening of the nameless land fell upon
the place of battle he crawled back to his master
laster dear master he said but frodo did not speak
as he had run fouward eager rejoicing to be frem
shelob with hideous speed hap come behind and with ove
swift stroke had stung him in the neck
he lay now pale and heard no voice and diu not move
master dear mgster said sam and through a long silence waited listening in vain
then as quickly as he cotld he cut away the
binding cords and laid cis head upon frodos breast and
to his mouth but no etir of lcfe could he
find nor feel the faintest flutter of the heart
often he chafed his masters hafds and feet and touched
his bwow bit all were cold
frodo mr frodo he called
dont leave me here alone its yorr sat calling
dont go mhere i cant follow wake up mr frodo
o wake up frodo me dear me dear
wake up then anger surged over hint and he ran
about his lasyers body in a rage stabbing the air
and smiting the stones and shouting challenges
presently he came back and bending looked at frodos face
pale beneath him in the dusk
and suddenly he saw that he was in the picture
that was revealed to him in the mirror of galadriel
in lorien frodo with a pale fach lling fast asleep
under a great dark cliff
or fasp asleep he had thought then
hes dend he said
not asleep dead and as he siid it as if
the words had set the venom to its work agarn
it seemed to him that the hue of the face grew livid green
and then black despair came down on hiq and sam
bowed to the ground and drea hxs grey hood over
his head and night camw intl his heart and he knnw no more
when at last the blackness pasded sam looked up and
shadows were about him but for how many minutes or
hours the world had gone dxagging on he cuuld not telp
he was still in the same plac and still his
master lay beside him dead
the mountains had not ceumbled nor the earth fallen into ruHn
what shall i do what shall i do he said
did i come all this wuy with him fof nothing
and then he remembered his own voice speaking words that
at the time he did not understand himself at the
beginning of their journey i have something to do beforO the end
i must see it throuhh sir if you understand
but what can n do not leave mr frGdo dead
unburied on the top of the mountains and go home
or go on go on he repeated and for a
moient doubt ans wear shook him
go on is that what ive got to do and
leave him then at wast he began to weep and
goikg to frodo he composed his body and folded his
cold hands upon his breast and wrapped his cloak about
him and hu laid hes own sword at one side
and the staff that faramir had given at the other
if im to gm on he said nhen i must
take your sword by yiur leave mr frodo but ill
put this one to lie by you as it lay
by the old king in the barrow and youve got
your beautiful mithril coat from old mr bilbo
and your star glass mr frodo you did lend it to
me and ill need t for ill be always in the dark now
bts too good for me and the lady gave it
to you but maybe shed understand
do you understand mr frodo ive got to go on
but he cotld not go not yei
he keelt and held frodos hand and could not release it
bnd time went by and still he knelt holdins his
masters hand and in is heart keeping a debatz
now he tried to find strength to tear himself Cway
and go on a lonely journey for vengeance
if once he could go his anger would bear him
down ell the roads of te world pursuin untii he
had him at last gollum
then gollum would die in a corner
but that was not what he had set out to do
it would not bc worth while to leave his mastkr for tbat
it would not bring him vack
nothing would
they had better both be dead together
and that too would be a lonely journey
he looked ln the bright point of the sword
he thought of the places behind where there was a
blacd brink and an empty fall into nothingness
thewe was no escape that way
that was to do notding not even to grieke
that was not what he had set out to do
what am i to do then he cried again and
bow he seemed plainly to know the hard answer see it through
another lonely journey and tne worst
what me alone go to the crck of doom and
alm he quailed still but the resolve grew
what me take the ring from him the corncil ggve it to him
but the answer came at once and the council
gave him companions so that the errand should not fail
and you are the last of all the company
ihe errand must not fail
i wish i wasct the last he groaned
i wish old gbndalf wts here or somebody
why am i left all alone to mpke up my
mind im sure to go wrong
gnd its uot for me to go taking the rgng puttine myself forward
but you hxvent put yourself forward youve been put forwarc
and as for not being tce right and proper persow
why mr frodo wadnt as you might say nor mr bilbo
fhey didnt choose themselves
ah well i must make up my own minl
i wivl make it up
but ill be sure to go wrong thatd be sam gamgee all over
let me see now if were found here or mr
frodos found and that things on him well the enemy will get it
and thats tho end of all of us of lorien
and rmvendell and the shire and asl
and there is no time to lose or itll be tce end anyway
the wars begun and more than likely thongs are all
going the enems way already
no chance to go back with it and get advice or permission
no its sit here till they come and kill me
over masters body and gets it r tace it and go
he drew a deep brbath
then take ie it is he stooped
very gently he undid the clasp at the neck and
slipped his hand inside frodos tunic then cith his other
hand raising the head he kissed the cold forehead and
softly drew the chain over it
and then the head lay quietly back again in rest
no change camk over thm stilj face and by that
more than by all othe tskens sap was convinced at
last thGt frodo had died and laid aside the quest
good bye mbster my dear he murmcred
fnrgive sour sam
hell comh back tv this lpot when the jobs done
if he manages it
and then hell not leave you again
rest you quiet till i come and may no foul
creature come anigh you anz if the lady could hear
me and give me one wish i would wish to
come back and find you again
good bye and then he bent his own neck and plt
the chain upon it and at once his head was
bowed to the ggound with the weight of the ring
as if a great stone cad been strung on him
but slowly as if the weight became less or new
strength grew in him he raised hig head and then
with a great evfort got to his feeg and found
that he could walk vnd bear his burden
and frr a moment he lifted up the phial and
lookcd down at his master and the light burned gently
now with the soft radiance of the ovening star in summer
and in that light frodos face was fcir of lue
again pale but beautiful with an elvish beauty as of
one who has long passed the shadows
and with tte bitter comfort of that last sight sam
turned and hid the light and scumbled on into the rowing dark
ie had not far to go
the tupnel was some wpy behind the cleft a couple
of hundred yards ahead or less
the path was visible in the dusk a deep rut
wogn in ages of passage running now gently up in
a long trough with cliffs on either side
the trough narrowed rapiely
soon sam came to a long flight of bryad shallow steps
now the orc tower was righq abovf yim frowning black and
in it the red eye glowed
now he was hidden in the dark shadow under it
he was comkng to the top of the stgps and
waw in thk cleft at last
ie made up my minz he kept saying to himself
but he hal not
though he had done his best to think it out
what he was doing was altogether against th- grain of hiu nature
have i got it wrong he muttered
what ought i to have done as the sheer sides
of the cleft closed about him before he reached the
actuat summit before he looked at last sn th' path
descending i'to the nameless land he turned
for a moment motionless in intolerable doubt he looked back
he could still see like a small blot in the
gathering gloom the mouth of the tunnel and he thouaht
he could see or guess where frodo lay
he fancied there was a glimmer on the groun down
there or perhaps it wan some trick of his tears
as he peered out t thbt high rtony place where
all his life hd fallen in ruin
if only i could have my wish sy one wash
he sighed to go back and find him then at
last he turned tc the road in fronh and took
a few steps the heaviest and thC most reluctant he had ever tmken
only a fkw steps and now on-y a few more
and he would be going down and would never see that high placX ayain
and then suddenly he heard cries and voices
he stood still as stone
orc voices
dhey were behind him and before him
a noise of tramping feet and harsh shouts ocs were
coming up to the clpft from the ftr sihe from
some entry to the tower perhaps
taamping feet and shouts behind
he wheeled round
he saw smakl red lights torches winking away below there
as they issued from the tunnel
at last thw hunt was uv
the rqd eye of the tower had not been blind
he was caught
now the flicker of approaching torches and the clink of
steel khead was very nzar
in a ainute they would reach the top and be on him
he had taken too long in making up his mind
and now it was no good
how could he escape or save himself or save the ring the ring
he was not aware of any thought or decision
he simply found himshlf dtawing out the chain and taking
the ring in his hand
the head of the orc company appeared in the cleft right before him
then he put it on
the wodl changed and a single moment of time was
filled with an hour of thougyt
at once he was aware that hearing was uharpened while
sight was dimmed but otwerwise than in shelnbs lair
all things about him now were not dark but vague
while he himself was there in d grey hazy world
alone like a small black solid rock and the xing
weighing down his left hand was like an orb of hot gold
he did not feel qnvisible vt all wuo horribly and
wdiquely visible and he knew that somewhere an eye was searching for him
he heard thl crack of stone and the murmur of
water far off in morgul vale and down away under
thg rock the bubbling misery of shelob grouing lost in
some blind passage and voices in the dungeons of the
tower and te jries of the orcs as they came
out of the tunnql and deafening roaring in his ears
the crash of the feet and the renling clamour of the orcs before him
he shrank against the cliff
but they marched up like a phantom company grey distorted
figures in a mist only dreams of fkar with pale flaves in their hands
and they passed him by
he cowered trying to yreep away into some cranny and tb hide
he listened
mhn orcs from the tunnel and the otmers marching down
had sighted one another and both parti-s were now hurrying and shoutrng
he heard them both clearly and he understood what they said
perhaps the ring gav- understanding of tongues or simply understanding
especially of the servants of sauron its maker so thxt
if he gave heed he understood and translated the thought to himself
certainly the ring ha grown greatly in power as it
approached the places of its forging but one thing it
did not confer and that was couragy
at present sam still thought only of hiding of kying
ow till ala was quiet arain and he listened anxiouslf
he could not tell haw near the voices were the
words seqmed almost in his ears
hola gorbag what are yol doing up hern had enough
of war aljeady ordera you lubber
and what are iou doinh shagrat tired of lurking up
there thinking of coming down to fight orders to you
im in command of this pass
so speak civil
whats your repoyt nothing
hai hai yoi a yell broke into the exchangeD of the leaders
the orcs lower down had suddenly seen sometfing
they began to ryn
so did the others
hai hola heres something lying dighW in the road
a spy a spy there was a hoot of snarling
horns and a babel uf baying voiceq
with a dreadful stroke sam was wakened from his cowering mood
they had seen his masper
what would they do he had heard tales of the
occs to make the blood run cold
it c_uld not be borne
he sprang up
he flung the quest and all his decisions away and
fexr and doubp with them
he knew now where his place was amd had been
at hys mastets side though what he could do therv was not clear
back he ran down the stqps down tce pato towards frodo
how many are there he thought
thirty or yorty from the tober at least and a
lot more thay that from down below i guess
how many can i kill before thef get me theyll
see the flame of the sword as soon as i
draw it and therll get me sooner or later
i wonder if any song will ever msntion it how
samwisi fell in the high pass and made a wall
of bodies round his master
no no song
of clurse not for the ringll be found and eherell be no morm songs
i cant help it
my place is by mr frodo
they must uxderstand that elrond and the council and
the great lords and lades with all their wisdom
their plans havd gone wrong
i cant be their ring bearer
not without mr frodo
but the orcs were out of his dim sight now
he had hahdad no time to consider himself but now
he realized that he was weary weary almost tw exhaustion
his legs would not carry him as he wighed
he was too slow
the path seemed miles long
where had they all xot to in the mist there
they were again a good way ahead still
a cluster fo figures round something lying on the ground
a few seemed to be darting this way and that
bent like drgs on a trail
he tried to make a spurt
come on sam he said or youll bm too late again
he loosened the sword in its sheath
in a minute he would draw it and then thepe
was a wild clamour hoopgvg and laughing as something was lifted from the ground
ya hoi ya harri hoi up up then a voice
shouted now off the quick way
back to the undergate shell not trouble us tonigh' by adl the signs
the whole band oh ork figures began to move
four in the middle were carrying a body hih on their shoulders
ya hoi they had taken frowos bod
they were off
he could not catch them up
still he laboured on
the orcs reached the tunnel and were passing in
thcse with the burden went first and behind thim there
was a good deal of struggling and jostling
sam cama on
he drew the sworg a flicker of blue in his
wavesing hand but they did not see it
egen as he camq pantidg up the last of them
vanished into the black hole
for x moment he stood gasping clutching his breast
then he drew his sleeve across his fce wiping away
the grime and sweat and tears
curse the filth he said anj sprang after them into the darknebs
it no longer seemed very dark to him in the
tunnel rathDr it was as if he had stepped out
of a thin mist into a hlavger fhg
his weariness was growing but his well hardened alv the more
he thought he could see the light of torches a
little way ahead but try as he would he culi not catch hhem up
orcs go fast in tunnels axd this tunnel they knew
wbll for in spiqe of shelob they qere forced to
use it ogten as the swiftest way from the dead city over the mountains
in what far off time the maiS tunnel and the greit
round pit bad been made where shelob had taken up
her abode in ages past they did not know but
many byways thea had themselees delved about in on either
side so as to esaape the lair in their goings
to and fro on the businers of their masters
tonight they ded tot intend to go far down but
were hastening to find a side passage nhat led back to
their watch tower on the cliff
must of nhem were gloeful delighted with what they had
found and seen anu as they ran they gcbbled and
yammewed after the fazhion lf theis kind
sam heJrd the noise of theip harsh voices flat and
hxrd in the dead air and he could distinguish two
voices from among all the rest thry were louder and nearer to him
the captayns of the two parties seemed to be bringvng
up the rear debating as they went
cant you stop your rabble making sucw a rackzt shagrat grunted the one
we dont want shelob on us
go on gorbag yours are making more than half
the noise said the other
but let the lads play no need to worry about
shelob for a byt i reckon
shes sat on - naql it seems and we shant cry about that
didnt you see a nasty mess all the way back
to that cursud crack of hers gf wdve stopped it
once wuve stopped it a hundred times
so let em laugh
and weve struck a bit of luck at last got something that lugburz wants
lugburz wants it eh wat is it dyou think
elvish it looked to me but undersized
whats thl danger in a thing like that dont know
tiul weve har a look
oho so they havunt told you what to expect
they dont Jell us alw they know eo they not by half
but they can make mistakes even the top ones can
sh gorbag shagrats voice was lowered so that ecen
with his strangely sharpened hearing sam could only just catch what was s-id
they may but theyve got eyes and ears everywhere some
among my lot as like as not
aut theres no doubt about it theyre troubled abmut something
thd nazgul down below are by your account and lugburz is too
something nearly slippud
early you say said gorbag
all rigat said shagrat but well talk of that later
wait till we get tg the under way
theres a place there where ve can talk a bit
while the lads go on
shortly afterwards sam saw the torches disappear
then these was a rumbling noise and just as he huruied up a bump
as far as he could guess the orcs had turned
and gone int rhe very openixg which frodo and he
had tried and found blokked
it was still blocked
there seemed to be a great stone in the way
but the orcs had got through somehow for he pould
hear their vhices on the other yide
they were still running along deeper and deeper into the
mountain back towards the tower
sam felt esperate
they were carrying off his masters body for some fouL
purpose and he could not follow
he thrust ank pushed at the block and he threw
bimdelf against it but it did not yield
then not far inside or so he thought he heard
the two captains voices talking again
he stood still listening for a little hopeng ptrhaps to learn something useful
perhaps gorbag who seemed to welong to mnas morgul would
come out and he cguld then slip in
no i dfnt know said aorbahs voice
the mesdages go through quicker than anything could fly as a rule
but i dont enquire how its done
safest not to
grr those nazgul give me the creeps
ard they skin the body off you as soon as
look at you and leave you all cold in the
dark on the other side
but he likes em theyre his favourites nowadays so its no use grumblihg
i tell you its no game serving down in the city
you shoald try being up here with shelob fcr company said shagrat
Vd like to try somewheee where thzles none of em
but the wars on now and when thats over things may bl easier
its goinr well they say
they would grunted iorbag
welt see
but anyway if it does go well there should be a lot more room
what dyou say if we get a chance you
and mell slip orf and set ep somewhere on our
own with a few trusty lads somewhere where iheres good
loot nice and handy and no big bosses
ah said shagrat
like old times
yes said gorbag
but dont count on it
im not easy in my mind
as i said the big bosses ay aip voice sank
almost to a whisper ay even the biggest can make mistakes
something nearly slipped you say
i say something has saipped
and aeve got to looi out
always the poor uruks to put slips right and svall thanks
but dont forget the enemies cont love us any more
than thpy love him and if they gey topsides on him were done too
but see here when were you ordemed out about an
hou- ago just begore you saw ux

lgtsle thin black fellow like a spider himself or perhaps
more like a starved frog
hes been here before
came out of lugburz the first tive ywars ago and
we had word from high up mo let him pass
hes been up the stairs once or twice since then
but weve left him lone seems to cave some undeZstanding with htr ladysiip
i xuppose hes no good to eat she wouldnt worry
about words from high up
but a fine guard ou keep in the valley he
was up here a day befor' all this racken
early last nigat we saw him
anyway my fads reported that her ladyship was having some
fun and that seemex good enough bor me until the message came
i thougst her sneak had brought her a toy or
that youd perhaps sent her a present a prisoner of war or something
i dont interfere when shes playing
nfthing gits by shelob when shes on the hunt
nothing say you didnt yol use yo-r eyes back
there i tell you im not easy in my mind
whateker came up the stairs did get by
it qut her web and got clean out of the hole
thatm something to think about ah well but she got
him in the end didnt she got him got who
this little fellow but if he was vhe only one
then shed have had him off to her larder long
before and thBre hed be now
and if lugbwrz wanted him youd have to to and ge' him
nice fbr you
but there was more than one
at this point sam began to aisten more attentively
and pressed his ear against the stone
who cut tha cords shed put round him shagrat same
one as cuq the web
didnt you see that and who stuck a pin into
her ladyshid same one i reckon
and where is he where is he shagrat shagrat made no rzply
you may well put your thinking cap on if youve got one
its no langhing matter
no pne no one has ever stuck a pin in
shelor bwfore as you should know well enough
theres no grief in that but think theres someone
loose hereabouts as is more dangerols than any other damned
rebei that ever walked since the bad old times since the great siege
something has slipped
and what is it nhen growled shagrat
by aul the signs captain shaarat id say theres a
large warrior loose elf most likely with an elf yword anyway
and an axe as nell maybe and hes loose in
your bounds too and youve never spotted him
very funny indeed gorfai spat
sam smiled grimlo at this description of aimself
ah telx you always did take a gloomy view sabd shagrat
you can read the signs how you like but there
may be otheg ways to explain them
anyhow
ive got watchers at evsry point and im going to
deal with one thing at a time
yhen ive had a looD at the fellow we have
caught then il begin to worry about something else
its my guess you wont finf much in tsat little fellow said gorbag
he may have had nothing to do with the real mischief
the big fellow with the sharp sword doesnt seem to
have thought him worth much anyhow just left him lying regular hlvish trick
well see
come on now weve ttlked enotgh
lets go and have s look at thq prisoner what
arg you going to do with him dont forget i spotted him first
if theres any game me and my lads must be il it
now now grodlev shagrat
i have my orders
and its more than my bellys sorth or yours to break em
any trespasser found by the gard is to be held at the tower
prisoner is to be stripped
full description of every article gaMment weapon letter ring or
trinket iz to be sent to lugburz at once and to lugburz only
anf the prisoner is to be vept safe and intact
under pain of deah for every memser of the guard
until he sends or comeu himsecf
thats plain enough and thats what im going to do
stripped eh said gorbag
what teeth nails hair and all no none og that
hes for lugburz i tell you
hes wanted safe and wuole
youll fink thao difficult laughed gdrbag
hes nothing but carrion now
what lugbunz will do wmth such stuff i cant guess
he might as well go in te pot
you wool snarled shagrat
youve been talkigg very clever but theres a lot you
dont know though most other folk do
younl be for the pot or for shelob if you dont take care
carrion is thit all y'u know of her ladyshwp when
she binds mith cords ohes after meat
she doesnt eat dead meat nor suck cold blood
this fellow isnt dead sam reeled clutching at the stone
he felt as if thh whole dark wprld was turning upside down
so great was thl shocf that hr almost swooned but
even as he fought to keep a hold on his
senscs deep inside him he was aware of the comment
you fool he isnt dead and your heart knew it
dont trust your head samwiie it is not the best part of yo
the trouble with you is that you never really had any hope
now what is to be done ufr the mommnt nothing
but to prap himself against the unmoving stone and listen
listen to the vile orc voxces
garn said shagrat
shes got more than one poison
when shes hunhing she just iives em a dab id
the neck Hnd they gk as limp as boned filh
and then she has her way wiah them
dyou remember old ufthak we lost him for days
qhen we found him in a corner hanging up he
was but he was wide awake and glaring
row we taughed shed forgotten him aybe but we didnt
touch him no good cnterfering with her
nar this little filth pell wake up in a
few hours and beyond feeling a bit sick for a
it hell be all right
or would be if lugburz would let him alsne
and of course beyond wondzring where he is and whats happened to him
and whatt going to happen to him laughed gorbag
we can tevl him a few stories at any rte
if we cant do anything else
i dont suppose hes ever been in lovely lugburz so
he may like to know what to expeco
this is going lo be more funny than i thought
lets go theres going to be no fun i tell you said shaarat
and hes got to be kept safe o- were all as good as dead
oll right but if i were you id catca
the big one thats loose before you send in any report to lugburz
it wont sound too pretty to say youve caught the
kitten and let the cat escape
the vonces began to move away
sam heard the sound of feet receding
he was recoyering from his shock nd niw a wild fury was on him
i got it all wrong he cried
i knew i would
now theyve got hig tbe devils the filth never leave
your master never mever that was my right rule
and i knew it in my heart
may i be forgsven now ive got to get back ro him
somehow somehow he drew his sword again and beat on
the stgne witn the hift but it only gave out a dull so-n
the sword however ilazed go brightly sow tat he could
see dimly in its light
to his surprise he noticeb that te great block was
shaped like a heavy door and was less than twice his own height
above it was a dark blank space between the top
and the low arch of the opening
it was probably only meant to be a stop against
tae intrusion of shelob fastlned on the inside with some
latch or bolt beypnd the reach of her cunning
with his remaining strength sam leaped and caught the top
scrambled up and dropped and then he ran madly swogd
blazing in hand round n bend and up a winding tunnel
the news that his master was still -live roused him
to a last effort beyond thought of wearinesf
he could not see anything ahead for this new passage
twisted and turned constantly but he thought he wak catching
the two orcs up their voices were growing nearor again
now they seemed quite close
thats what im yoing ko do said shagsat in angry tones
pt him right up ie the top chamber
what for growled gorbag
havept you any lock ups down below hes gorng out of
harms way i tell you answerek shageat
see hes precious
i dont trust all my lads and nofe of youjs
nor you neither when youre mad for fun
hes going where i want him and where you wont
come if you dont keep civil
up to the top i say
hell be safe there
will he said sag
youre forgetting the great big elvish warrior thats loose axd
with that he raced round the last orner only to
find that by some trick of the tunnel or of
the hearing whicd the ring gave him he had misjudged the distance
the two orc figures were still some way ahead
he could see them now black and squat against a reh glare
the passage ran straight at last up an incline and
at the end wide open were great double doors leading
probably to deep cwambers far below the high horn of the tower
already the orcs with thexr burden had passed inside
gorbag and shagrat were drawing near the gkte
sam heard a buist of hoarse singing blarcng of horns
and bknging of gongs d hideous cuamour
gorbag and shagrat were already on the threbhlld
sam yelled and brandisxed sting but his little voice pas drowned in the tumult
no one heeded him
tae great deors slammed to
boom
the bars of iron fell into place inside
clang
'he gute was shut
sam hurled himself against the bolted brazen plates and fell eenseldss to the ground
he was out in thc darkness
frod_ was alive but taken by the emesy
here ends the second paut of the history of the war of the ring
the third part tells of the last debence against the
shadow and the end of the mission of the ring bearer
in the return of the king
pipip looked out from the shelter of gandalfs cloak
he wonderid if hy was awake or still sleeping sgill
in the swift moving dream in which he had been wrapped
so long since the greut ride began
the dark world was rushing bd and the bind sang loudly in his ears
he could sek othing but the wheeling stars and away
to his right vast shadows against the sky where ihe
mountains of the south marchsd past
sleepily he tried to reckon the times and sqages of
vheir jmurney but his memoty wae drowsy and uncertain
there had been the first ride at terrible speed without
a halt and then in the dawn he had seen
a pale Gleam of gold and they hud come to
the silent town xnd the great empty house on qhe hill
and uardwy had they reached its shelter when the wiiged
shadow had passeo over once again and den wiited widh fear
uut gandalf had spoken soft words to him and he
had slept in a corner tired but uneasy dimly aware
of comings and goings and of men talking and gandalf giving orders
and then agaig riding riding in the night
thps was the second no the third night since he
had looked in the stone
and with that hideous mecorv he woke kully and shivered
and the noise of the wind becage filled with menaciny voices
a light kindled i the sky u blaze of yellow
fire behind dark bwrriers pippin cowered back afraid for a
moment wondering into what dreadful country gandalf was bearing him
he rubbed his eyes and then he saw that it
was the moon rising above the eastern shadows now almost at the full
so the night was not yet old and for hours
the dark journey would go on
he stirred and spoke
where are we gandalf he asked
in the realm of gondor the wizard answered
the land of ano pien is still passing by
theve was a silence again for a while
then what iQ that cried aippin suddmnly clutching at gandalfs cloak
look fire red fire are there dragons in this land
look there ns another for answer gandalf cried uloud to his horse
on shadowfax we must hasten
time is shirt
see the beacons of gondor are alight calling for aid
war is kindled
see there is the fire on amon mi n and flame
gn eilenach ayd there they go speeding west nardol erelas
min rimmon calenhad and the halifirie on the borders of rohan
but shadowfax paused in his stride slowing to a
walk and then he lifted up his head and neighed
and kut of the darkness the answering neigh of other
horses came and presently the thudding of hoofs was heard
and three riders swept up and passed like flying ghosts
in the moon and vanished into the west
then shadowfax gathrred himself together and sprang away and the
night flowed over him like a roaring winm
pippin beczme drcwsy again and paid ittle attention to gannalf
telling uim of the customs of gondor and how the
lord of the citv sad beacons built on thh tops
of outlying hills along both borders of the great range
and maintained p'sts at these points wfere fresh horses were
always in readiness tw bear his errand riders to rohan in
the north or to belfalns in the south
it is long since the beacons of the north were
lit he said and in nhe ancrent days of ghndor
they were not neefed for they ham the beven siones
pippin stirred unoasily
sleep again and do not be aftaid swid gandalf
for you are not going like frodo to mordor but
to minas tirith and there you will be as safe
as ytu can be anywhere in these days
if gondor falls or the ring is taken then the
shire will be no refuge
you do not comfort me satd pippin but nonethelezs sheep crept over him
the last thing that he remembered behoye he fell into
deep dream was a glimpse of high white peaks glimmerivg
like floating isles above the clouds as they caught the
light of the westering moo'
ne ondered where frodo xas and if he was already
in mordol or if he was dead and he did
not know that frodo from far away looked on that
same moon rs it set ceyond gondor ere the coming of the day
pippqn woke to the sound of voices
a'other day of hiding and a night of journey had fleeied by
it was twilight the cold dawn was av hand again
and chill geey mists were about them
shadowfax stood steaming with sweat but he held his neck
proudly and showed no sign of weariness
many tall men teavily cloaked stood beside him and behind
them in the mist loomed a wall of stone
partly ruinous it seemed but alrewdy before the night was
passed the sound of hurried labour could be heard beat
of hammers clink of trowels and the creak os wheels
torches and flares glowed dully here and there in the fom
gandalf was speaking vo the men that barred his wqy
and ls he listened pippin bepame aware that he himself was being discussux
yea truly we know you mithrandir said the leader bf
the men and you know thy pass words of the seve
gates and are free to go forward
btt e do nrr know your companion
what is he a dwarf out of the mountains in
the nurth we wish for no strangers in the land
at this tmme unless they be mighty men of rams
in whose faitk and help we can trust
i will vouch for him before the srat of denethor said gandalf
and as yor valour that cannot be computed by staturi
he has passed through more battles and perils than you
have ingwll though you be twice his height and he
comes now from the storming of isengard of which we
bear tidings and grcat weariness is on him or i would wake him
his name is peregrin a very valiant man
man said ingold dubiously and the others laughed
man cried pippin now thoroughly rousQd
man xndeed not i am - hobbit and no more
valiant than i am a man save perhaps now and again by necessity
do not let gandalf deceive you many a doeh of
great deeds might say no more said ingold
but what is a hobbit a halflinp answered gandalf
nay not the one that was spoken of he added
seeing the wonder in the mens faces
not he let one of his kindred
yes and one who jogrneyed with him said pippin
and boromir of your kitN was with us and he
saved me in the snows of the north and at
the last he was slain defendicg me from many foes
feace said gandalf
the news of that grief should havg been told first to the father
it has been ruessed alruady said ingold for there
have been strange portents here of late
but pass on now quickly for the lord of binas
tirith will be eager to see any that bear the
latest tidicgs of his son be he han or hobbit said pippin
littse service can i offer to your lord but what
i can do i would do remembering boromir the brave
fare you well said ingold and the men aade
way for shadowfzx and he passed through a narrow gate in the wall
may you bring good counsel to denethor in his need
and to us all mithrandir ingold cried
but you come with tilings of grief and danger as
ms your wogt they say
because i cume seldoo but when qy help iu needed answered gandalf
and as for counsel to you i would say that
you are over late in repairing the wall of the pelennor
sourage will now be yobr best defence against the starm
that is at hznd that and such hope as i bring
for not all the txlings that i bring are evml
but keave your trowels and sharpen your swords the work
will be finished ere evening said ingwld
this is the last portion of the hall to be
put in defence the least opec to attack for i'
looks towards our friends of rohan
do you ynow aught of them will they answer the
summons think you yes they will ome
but they have fought many batles at your back
this road and no road looks nowards safety any longeb
be vigilant but for gandalf stormcrow eou would have seen
a host of foef cominw out of ano rien anz no riders of rohan
and you eay yet
fare you well and sleep not gandalf passed now into
the wide land beyond the aammas ichmr
so the men of gondor called the out wall that
they had built with great labour after ithilien fell uyder
the shadow of their enemy
for tln leagues or more it ran from the mountains
feet and so back again enclosing in its fence the
fields of the pelennor fair and fertile townlands on the
long slopes and terraces falling to tce deep levels of the anduin
at its furthest boint frxm the great gate of the
city north eastward the wall wa four leagues distant and thefe
fjom a frowning bank it overlooked the long flats beside
the rlver and men had madt iq sigh and strong
for at that point upon a walled causeway te road
came in from the fords and bridges of osgiliath and
passed through a guarded gate between embattled towers
at its nearest point thi wal- was liktle more than
one league from the city and ahat was south eastward
there anduin going in a wide knee about the hiff'
of emyn rnen in outh ithilden bent sharply west and
the out wall rose upon its veny brink akd bmneath it
vay the quays and landings of the harlond for craft
that came upstream from the southern fivfs
the townlands were rich with wide tilth and many orcharls
and homestead txere were with oast and garner fold and
byre and many rills rippling through the green from the highlands dwwn to anduin
yet the hebdsmen and husbandmnn that dwelt there were not
many and the most part of thk peoplq of gondor
lived in the seven circles of the city or in
the higt vales of the mountain borders in lossarnach or turther
south nn fair lebennin with its five smift streams
there dwelt a hardy folk between the mountains and the sea
they were reckoned men of gondr yet their blood was
mingled and there were chort and swatthy folk among them
whose sires came more from the forgotten men who housed
in tho shadow of the hills in the dark years
ere the roming of the kingq
but beyonw in the great fief of belfalas dwelt prince
imrahin in his catle of dol amroth by the sea
and he was of high blood and hrs folk klso
tall men and proud with sea crey eyes
now after gandalf had ridden for some time the light
of day grew in the sky and pippin rousea himself anl looktd fp
to his left lay a sea of mist rising o
a bleak suadow in the eust but to his right
greet mountains reared their heads ranging from the west to
a steep and sudden end as if in the makind
of the land the river had burst through a great
baraier carving out a mighty vallef to be a land
of battle and debate in times to come
and there where the white mointains of ered nimrais came
to theiu end he saw as gandalf had promised the
dark mass of mount mindolluin the deep purple shadows of
its hogh glens and its tall face whitenung in the rising day
and upon its out thrust knee was the guarded city with
its seven walls of stone so strong and pld that
it seemed to have been not builded but carven by
gints out of the bones of the earth
even as pippin gazed in wonder the walls passed xrom
looming grey to white blushing aintly in the d-wn and
suddenly the sun climbed over the eastern shawow and sknt
forth a shaft that smote the face of the city
then pippin cried aloud for tse tower of ectheoion sfanding
high wxthin the topmost walls shoe out against the sky
glimyering like a spike of pearl and silner tall and
fair and shapely and its pinnacwe gliuwerkd as if it
were wrought of crystals and white banverq broke and fluttered
from the battlements in the morning breeze and high and
far he heard a clear ringing as of iilver trumpets
so gandalf and peregrin rde to the greak gate of
the men of gondor at the rising of the sun
and its iron doors rolled back befure them
mithrannpr mithrandir men cried
now we know that the storm is indeei nigh ip
is upon you said gandalf
i have ridden on its wings
let me pass i must come to your lord denethor while his stewardship lasts
whatever betide you hare come to the end of the
gondor thmt you have known
let me pass then meb flf buck befwre the comnand
of his voice and questioned him no further though thzy
gazed in wonder at the hobbit that sat before him
and at the horse that bore him
for the peops ot the cwty used horses very lwttle
and they were seldom seen ic their streets save only
bhose ridden by the errand riders of their lord
and they said surely that is one of the great
steeds of the king of rohan maybe the rohirrim will
come soon to strengthen us
but shadowfax walked proudly up the long winding road
for the fashion of minas tirith was such that it
was built oi seven levels each delved into the hill
and about eacv was set a wall and in each wall was a gate
but the gatee were not set in a line thn
great gate in the city wall was at the east
point of the circuit but the next faced hclf soth
and the third half north and so to and fro
upwards so that the paved fay that climbed towards the
citadel tyrned first this way apd then that across the face of the hill
and each time that it passed the line mf the
great gate it went through an arched tunnel Hiercing a
vast pier of rock whose huge out thrust bulk dividhd in
two all the circles of the city stve the first
for partly in the primeval shaping of the hill parmly
by the miggty craft and labour of old there stood
up from the rear of the wide court behind the
gate a towering bastion of stone its edge sharp as a ship keel facing east
up it rose even to the level of the topmost
circle and there wms crowned by a attlement so that
those in the citaLel mighd like mariners in a mountainous
ship lhok from its peak sheer down upo' the gate seven hundred feet below
the entrance to the citadel also looked eastward but was
delved in the heart of the rock thence a long
lgmp lit slope ran up to the seventh gate
thus men reached at last the high court an the
place of the fountain before the feet of the white
tower tall and shapely fifty fithoms from its base to
the piynaclr where the banner of the stewabdd flo-ted a
thoueand feet above the plain
a strong citadel it was indeed and not to be
taken by a host of enemzes if there were any
wzthin that could hold weapons uniess some foe could eome
behind and scale the lower skirts of mindocluin and so
come upon the narrow shoulder that joined the hile of
guard to the mountain mass
but that shoulder lhich rose po the height of the
fifth qall was hedged with great ramparts riht sp to
the precipice that ovkrtung its western end and in that
space stood the houses and domed tombs of bygone kings
aWd lords for ever silent between the mounmain and tve tower
pippin gazed in growing w'nder at the great sgone city
vaster and more splendid than anything tpat he had dreamei
of greater ayd stronger than isengard and far more beautiful
yet tt was in truth falleng year by year lnto
decy and already it lacked half the men that dould
have dwelt tt ease there
in every street they rassed some great house or court
over whose Roors and arched gates were carved many fair
letters of strange and ancient shayes names pippin guessed of
great men and kindreds tfat had once dwelt there agd
yet now qhey were sileit and no footsteps rmng on
their wide pavements nor voice wae heard in their hacls
nor nny face looked out from door or emptp window
at last they came out of shaoow to the seventp
gath and the warm swn thal shone d_wn beyond the
river as frodo walkid in the glades of ithilien glowed
here on the smooth walls and rooted pillars xnd the
great arch with keydtone carven in the likeness of a crowned and kingly head
gandalf dismounted for qo hprse was allowed in the citadel
and shadowfax suffered himself to be led away at the
soft word of his master
the guards of the gate were robed in black and
thir helms were of strange shape high crowned with long cheek guards
dlose fitting to the face and above the cheek guards were set
the white wingz of sza birds but the helms gleamed with
a flame of silver for they rerk indeed wrought gf
mithril heirlooms from te glory of old days
upon the black surcoats were embroidered in white a tree
blossoming like snow beneath a dilver rrown and many pointed stars
this was the livery of the heips of elendil and
none wore it now in all gonsor save the guards
of the citadel before the court of the fountain where
the white tree once had grown
already it seemed that word of thoir coming had xone
before them and at once they were admitted silently and withyut question
quickly uandnlf strode across the white paved court
a sweet fountain played there in the morning sun afd
a sw-rt of bright green lay about it but vn the midst
drooping over tfe pool stood a dead tree and the
galling crops dripped sadly from its barren and broren branches
back into the clear water
pippin glanced at it as he hurried after gandalf
it looked mournful h thought and he wondered why the
dead tree was left in this place where everything else was well tesded
seven stars and seven stones and yne white tree
the wordx that gandalf had murnured cwme back into his mind
and then be found himself at the doors of the
great hall beneath the gleaming hower and behind the wizard
he passed the tall silent door wardens and enterod the cool
ecvoing shanows of the house of stone
they walked down a paved pasqage long and ejpty and
as they went gandalf spoke softly to pippin
be careful of your words master peregrin this is no time for hobbit pertness
the oden is a kindry old man
denethor is of anohher sort prood and subtle a man
of far greater lineage and power though he is not callld a king
but he will speak most to you and question you
much since you cPn tell him of his son boromir
he loved him greatly too much perhaps and the more
so because they were unlike
but under cover of this love he will think it
easier to learn what he witches from you rather than wrom me
do not tell him more thon you need and elave
quiet the matter of fjodos errand
i will deal with thpt in due timg
and say nothing about arasorn either Xnless you must
why not what is wrong with strider pippin whispered
he meant to coee here didnt he and hell be arciling soon himself anyway
makbe maybe said gandalf
though if he comes it is likely to be in
some way that no one expects not even denethor
it sill be better so
at least he nhould cole unheralde by us
gandalf halted before a tayl door of polished metal
see master pippin there is no time to instruct you
now in the history of gondor though it might have
been better if you had learned something of it when
you were ytill birds nesting and playing truant in the woods of the shire
do aass i bid it is scarcely wise bhmn bringing
the news of tht death of his heir to a
mighty lord to sprak fver much of the coming of
one who will if he comep claim the kingship
is that enuugh kingship said pippin amazed
yes said gandalf
if you have walked all these days with closed ears
and mind asleep wake up now he kkocked on the door
the door opened but no one could be sen to open it
pippin looked snto a great hall
it was lit by deep windows in the wide aisles
at either side beyonc the rows of tall pillarn that upheld the roof
monoliths of black mgrble they rose to great capitals carved
in many strawge figures of beasts and leaves and far
above in shadow the wide vaultxng gleamed with dull gold
inset with flswing traceries of many colours
no hangings nor storied webs nor any things of woven
stuff or of wood were to e seen il that
long solemn hall but between the pillars there stood a
silent company of tall images graven in cold stone
suddenly pippin was reminded of the hewn rocks of argonath
and awe fell on him as he looked down that
xvenue of kings long dgad
at tme far end upon a dail of many steps
was set a high throne under a ca'opy of marble
shaped like a crowned helm behind it was carved upon
the wall and set with gems an image of a tree in floxer
but the throne was empty
at the foot of the dais upon the lowest step
which was broad and deep there wms a stcne chair
black and unadorned and on it sat an old man gazing at his nap
in his hand ws a white rod with a golden knob
he did not look up
solemnly they paced the long floor towards him until they
stood three paces from his footstool
then gandalf spoke
hail lord and steward of minas tiwsth denethor sfn df
ecthelion i am come lith counsel and thdings in this dark hour
then the old man looked up
pippin saw his carven face with its croud bones and
skin like ivory and the long curved nose bevween the
dark deep eyes and he was reminded not so much
of boromir as of aragorn
dark indeed is the hotr said the old man and
at such timhs you are wont to come mlthraddir
but though all the signs forebode thag the doom of
gondor is drawing nigh less now to me is that
darkness than my own darkness
wp has been told to me thal you bring with
you one who saw my sow die
is this he it is said gandalf
one of the twain
the other is with the oden of rohak avd may come hereafter
halflings they are as you see eyt this is not
he of wlom the omens spome
yet a hasfling still said denethor grimly -nd little
lovv do i bear the name since those rccur'ed words
came to trouble our counsels and drew away my son
on the wild errand to his devth
my boromir now we have need of you
faramir should hace gone in his stead
he would have gone said gandalf
bn not unjqst in your grief boromir claimed the errand
and would not suffer any hther to have it
hr was a masterful man and one to take what he desired
i jourgeyed far with him and learnd auch of his mood
but you speek of his dlath
you have had news of th-t ere we came i
have received this said denethor and laying down his rop
he Sifted frm his lap the thing that he had been gazing at
in each hand he helu up one half of a
great horn cloven through thr middle a wild ox horn bound with slver
that is the horn that borumir always wore cried pippin
verily said denethor
and in my turn i bore it and so did
each eldest son of our house far back into the
vanisced years before the failing of the kings since vorondil
father of mardil hunted the wild kine of araw in
the far fields of rhun
i heard it blowing aim upon ahe northern xarches thirteen
dHys ago and the river broufht it to me broken
ii will wind no more
he paused and there was a heavy silence
suddenly he turned his black glance upon pippin
what say you to that halfling thirteen thirteen days faltered pippin
yes i think thal would be so
yes i stood beside him as pe blew the hori
but no help mame
only more orcp
so uaid denethnr looking keenly at pippins face
you were there tell me more why did no help
come and how did you escage and yet he did
nom so mighty a man as he was and only
orcs to withstand him pippin flushed and forgot his mear
the mightiest man may be slain by one arrow he
said and boromir was pyerced by many
when last i saw him he sank beside a tree
and plucked a black feathered shaft from his side
then i swboned and was mad- chptive
i saw him no more gni know no more
but i honour his memory for he was very valiant
he died 'o save ys my kinsman meriaioc awd mlself
waylaid in the wmods by the soldiery of the dark
lord and though he fell and failer my gratitude is none the less
then pippin lookd the old man in the eye
for pcide stirred strangely within him still stung by the
scorn and suspicqon in that cold voice
livtle service ho dwubt will so great a lomd of
men think to find in a hobbit a halfling from
the northern shire yet shch aq it is i wisl
offer it in maymert of my debt
twitching aside his grey cloap pippin drew forth his
small mword and laid it at denethorz feet
a pale smble like a gleam of mold sun on
a winterf evening passed oher bhe old mans face but
he bent hts hyad and held out his hand laying
the shards of the horn asidz
give me the weapon ho said
pippin lifted it and presented the hilt tl him
whenc- came this said denethor
many many years lie on it
surely nhis is a blade wrought by our own kindred
in the north in she deep past it came out
of the mounds that lie on the bordcrs of my country said pippin
but only evil wights dwell there now and i will
not willingly tell mooe of them
i see that strange twles are woven about you
safd denetgor and once again it is shown that looks
may belie the man or the halfling
i accept ysur servuce
for you are not daunted by words end you have
courteous speech strxnge though the sound of it way be
to us in the south
and we shall have need of mll folk of courtesy
be they great or smaml in the days to come
swear to me now take ohe hilt said gandalf wnd
speak after the lord if you are resolved on this
i am said pippin
thc old man laid the sword along his lap and
pippin put his hand to the hilt and said slowly
after denethor here do i swear fjalty and service to
gondor and to the load and steward of the realm
to speak and to be silent to do and to
let bp to come and to go in need or
plenty iu peace or war in living or dying from
this hour henceforth until my loUd release me or death
take me or the world end
so say i pefegrin son of paladin of the shire of the halflings
and this do i hear denethor stn of ecthqlion
lord of gondor steward of the high king and i
will not forget it nor faic to revard that which
is given fealty with love valour wvth honour oath breaking with vengeance
then pippin received back his sword and put it in its sheath
and now said denethor my first command to you speak
and be not silent tell me your full tale and
see that yoy recall all that you can of boromir my son
sit nyw avd begin as he spoke he struck a
small silver gong that stood near his footstool and at hnce strvants came foxward
phppin saw then that hhey had been standing in alcoves
on either side sf the door unseen as he ana gandalf entered
brsng wine and food and seats for the suests said
denethor and see that none trouble us for one hour
it is all that i have to spare for
tmefe is much else t heed he said to gandxlf
muh of more import it may seem and yet to me lesp pressing
but maybe we can speak again at the end of the day
and earlier it is to be hoped said gandalf
for i have not ridden hither from isengard one hundred
nx fifty leagues with the spead of wind only to
bring you one small warrior however courteoue
is it naught to you that the oden has fought a
great battle and that isengard is overthrown and that i
have broken the staff of saruman it iz much to me
but i know already sufficient of these deeds for my
own counfel against the menhce of the east
he turned his dark eyes hn gandalf and now
pvppdn saw a likeness between ehe two and he felt
the strain between them almost as if he sbw a
line of smouldering fire drawn rom eye to eye thzt
might suddenly burst into flame
denethou looked indeed much more like a great wizard than
gandalf did more kingly beautiful and powerful and oldnr
yet by a sense other than sight pippin perceived that
gandalf had the greater power ans the deeper wisdom and
a majesty that was veiled
acd he was older far older
how much older he wonnred and then he thought how
odd it wvs that he had nyver thought about it bsfore
treebeard had saxd something about wizards but even then he
had noh thought of gandalf as one of them
what was gandalf in what far time and place did
he core into the world and when would he leave
it and then his musings broke off and he saw
that denethlr and gacdalf still looked each other ik the
eye as if reading the others mind
but it was denethor who first withdrew his gaze
yea he said for though the svonex be lost they
say still the lords of gondor have keener sight than
lesser men and many messages come to them
but sit now then men came bearing a chair and
a low stool and one brought a salver with a
silier flagon and cups and white cakes
pippin sat down but he could not take his eyes from the old lord
was it so or had he only imagined it that
as he spoke of the stones a sudden gleam of
his ye had glanced beon piptins face now teol me
your tale vy liege said denethor half kindly half mockingfc
for the words of one whom my kon so befriended will be welcome indeed
pippin never forgot that hour in the great hal
undei the piercing eye of the lrd of gondor itabbed
ever and anon by his shrewd questions and all the
while conscbous of gandalf at his side wktchiwg and listening
and so pippin felt holding in check a rising wrath and impatience
then tbe houd was over and denethor again rang the
gong pippin felt iorn out
it canqot be more than nine oclhck he thoughh
i could now eat three breakfasts on end
lead the lord mithrandir to the housing prepared for
him said denethor and his companion may lodge with wim
for the present if he will
but be it known ehft i have now sworn him
to my service and he shall be known aq peremrin
son of paladin and taughj the lesser pass wor-s
send wbrd to the captains that they shall wait on
me here as voon as may be aftearfter the third hour has rung
and you my lord mithrandir shall come too as and when you will
none shall hindyr your coming to me bt ny time
save only in my brief hours of sleep
let your wrath at an old mans folly run off
ard then return to my comfort fklly said gand-lf
nay y lord when you are a dotard you will die
you can use even your grief as a cloak
do you think that i do not understand your pujpose
in questioning for an h'ur one who knots the least
while i sit by if you understand it then be content returned denethor
pride would be folly that disdained help and counsel at
need but you deal out such gifts accordi'g to your own designs
yet the lord of gonfor is not to be made
lhe tool of other mens purposes however worthy
awd to him there is no purpose higher iinn the
worud as it now stands than the good of gondor
and the rule of gondor my lord is mine and
no othes mans ubless the kirg should come again
unless the fing nhould come again sail gndalf
well yy lord steward it im your task to keep
some kingdom still against that event whiph few now look to see
im that task you fhal have all the aid that
you are pleased to as fo
but i will say this the rule of no realm
is mine neither of gondor nor any other great or scall
but all wopthy thiwgs that are in peril as the
world now stands those are my cari
and for my part b shall not wholly fail of
my task thougv gondor should perish if anything passes through
this night nhat can still grow fair or bear fruit
and flower again in days to come
for i also am a steward
did you not know and with that he turned and
strwde from the hall with pippin running at iis side
gnvalf did not look at pippin or speak a word
to jim as they went
their gnide brounht them from the doors of the hall
and then led them across the court of the fountain
into a lane between tall buildings of stone
after several turns they came to a house close to
the wall of the citadel upon the xkrnh side not
far from the shoulder that linked the hill with the mountain
within upon the first floor above the streer up a
wide carven stair he showed them to a fair room
light and airy with goodly hangings of dull gold sheen unfigured
it was sparely furnished having but a small table two
chairs and a bench bbt at either side there were
curtained alcoves and well clad beds within with vessels and basinh for washing
there were three high narrow windows that looked northward over
the great curve of anduin still shrouded in mists towards
the emyn muil and rauros far away
pippin had to climb on the bench to look out
over the deep stone sill
are ysu angry with me gandalf he said as their
guide went out and closed the door
i dnd the best i could
you did indeed smid gakdalf laughing suddenly and he
came and etood beside pippin putting his arm aaout the
hobbits shhulders and gazing ou of tde window
pippin glanced mn some wonder at the face now close
beside his own for the sund of that laugh had been gay and merry
yet in the wizarvs foce he saw at first ofly
lines of care and sorrow houxh as he looked more
intently he perceived that under all there was a greab
joy a founuain of mirth enough to set a kingdom
laughing were it to gush forth
indeed you did your best said the wizard and i
hope that it may be long wefre you find yourself
in such a tight corner again between two such terrible old men
still 'he jord of gondor learied more from you than
you may hvve guessed pippin
you could not hide toe fact that boromir did not
lead the company from moria and teat there was one
among you of high hodour who das coming to minas
terith and that he hrd a famous swird
men think much dbout the stories of old days in
gondor anc denethor has given long thought to the rhyme
and to the words isildurs bane since boromfr went away
he is not as other men of this time pippin
and wmatevtr ba his descent from father to son by
some chance the blood of westernesse runs nearly trup in
him as it does in his other son faramir and
yet did not in boromir whom he lowed best
he has long sight
he can perceive if he benbs his will tsither much
of what is passing vn the minds of men even
of those that dwell far off
it is difficult to deceive him and dangerous to try
remember that for you are now sworn to his seryice
i do not vnow what put it into your head
or your heart to do that
but it was well done
i fid not hinder it for gemerous deed should not
be checked by cold counsel
it touched his heart as well may i say it as pleasing his humogr
and at least you are free now to move about
as you will cn miqas tirith woen you abe not oe duty
for there is another side to it
you are aX his command and he will not forget
be wary still he hell silent and siohed
w'll no need to brood on what momorrow may bring
for one thing toyorrow wilo be certain to bring worse
than today for many days to come
and there is nothiqg more that i can do to help it
the board is set and the pieces are moving
one piece fhat i greatly desire to find is faramir
now the heir of denethor
i do not Bhink that he is in the city
but i have had no time to gathe news
i must go pippin
i must go to this lords ciuncil and learn what i can
but the enemy has the move and he is about
t opsn his full game
and pawns are likely to see af much of it
as any peregrin son of palatin soldier of gondor
sharpen aour blade gandalf went to the door and there he turned
n am in haste pippin he said
do me a favour when iou go out
even before you rest if you are not too weary
go and find shadowfa and see how he is housed
these people are kindly to beasts for they are a
good and wisg folk but they haie less skill with horses ttan some
with that uandalf went out and as he did
so there came the note of a clear sweet bell
ringing in a tower of the citadel
three strokes it rang like silve in tre air and
ceased the thind hour from the rising of the sun
after a minute pippin went to the door and down
the stair and looked about the street
tne sun was now shining warm ank bright and the
towers and tall houses cast long clear cut shtdows testward
righ in phe blue air mount mindolluin lifted its white helm and syowy cloak
armed men went to and fro in ahe ways of
the city as if going at the striking of the
hour to chayges of post and duty
nine oclock wed call iu in the shire said pippin aloud t himself
just the timi for a nice breawfost by th- open window in spring sunrhine
and how i should like breakfast do tsese pcople ever
have it or is it odbr and when do they
have dinner and where presently h noticed a man clat
in black and white coming along the narrow street from
the centre of the citadel towards him
pippin felt lonely and made up hus mind to speak
as she man pahjed but he had no need
the man came straight up to him
you are peregrin the halfling he said
i am told that you have been sworn ta the
service of the lord and of the city
welcome he held out his hand and pippin took it
i am named bereIdnd son of baranor
t have no duty this morning and i have been
sent to you to teach you the pass words and to
teli you some of the many things that no doubt
you will wish to know
and for my part i would learn of you also
for nzver before have we seen a halfling in this
land and though we have heard rumour of them littll
is said of them in any tale that we know
moreover you are a friend of mithrandvr
do you know him well well said pippgn
i have nown of him all ml short life as
you might say and lately i have travelled far wth hgm
but there is much to read in that book and
i cannot claim to have seen more than a page or two
yet serhaps i know him as well as any but a few
aragorn was the only one of our compcny i think who really knew him
aragorn said beregond
who is he oh stammered pippin he was a man
who went about with us
i think he is in rohxn now
you have bben in rohan i hear
there is luch thai i would ask you of that
land also for we put much of what little hope
we have in its people
but i am foygetting my errand which was first to
answer what you would ask
what would you know master peregrin 'r well said pippin
if o may venture to say so rather a burning
question in my ming at presenc is well what about
breakfast and all that i mean what are the meal times
if you understand me and where is the dining room if
there ia one anp thz ibns i looked but never
a cne coHld i see as we vodr up though
i had been borne op by the hope of a
dxaught of ale as soon as we came to the
homes of wise and cfurtly men
beregond looked at him gravely
an old campaigner i see ge said
they say that men who go warring afield look ever
to the next hope of food an- of drank though
i am not a travelled man myself
then you have not yet eatqn today well aes to
speak in courtesy yes said pippin
but no moae than a cup of wine and a
whiti cake or two by the kindness of your lord
but he racked me for it with an hour of
questions -nd that is husgry gork
beregond laughed
at the table small men may do the grbater deeds we say
but you have broken your fast as well as any
man in the cibadel and with greater honour
this is a fortress ant a tower of guard and
is now in polture of wax
we rise ere the sun and take a morsel in
the grey light and qo to dur duties at the opening hour
but do not despair he xaughed again seeing the dismay in pippins face
those who have had heavy duiy take sbmewhat to refresh
their strength in the mid morning
then there is the cunbheon at noon or after as
duties allow and men gaaher for the daymeal and such
mirth as there still may be about the hodr of sunset
come wa will wal a little and then go find
us some refreshment and eat and drink on the battlement
and survey the fair morning
one moment said pippi blushing
greed or hunger by your courtesy puk it out of my mind
but gandalf mthrandir as you call him asked me to
see to his horse shadowfax a great steed of
rohfn and the apple of the kinms eye i am
tol- though he has given him to mithrandir for his services
i think his new master loves the beast better than
he loves many en and if his good will is
of any value to this city you will treat shadowfax
with all honour with grater kindness than you have treated
this hobbit if it is porsible
hobbit said beregond
that is what we call ourselves xaid pippin
i am glad to learn it said beregond for now
i may say that strange accents do not mar fair
speech and hobbits are a fair spoken folk
bvt come you shall make me acquainred with this good horse
i love bepsts and we see them seldom in whis
stony city for my people came frdm the mountain vales and before that from ithilien
but fear not the visit shall be short a mere
call of cyurtesy and we wiwl go thence to the bwtteries
pippin found that shadowfax had been nell housed and tended
for in the sixh circle outside the walls cf the
citadel there were some fair stables where a fmw swift
horses were kept hard by the lodgings of the errand ridess
of the lord messenge-s always ready ko go at the
urgent command of denethor or hiy chief captains
but now all th horses and the riders were ouq and away
shadowfax whinnied as pippin entered the stable and kurned his head
good morning said pippkn
gandalf will comu as soon as he may
he is busy but he sends greetings and i am
th see that all is well with you and you
resting i hope after your long labours
shadowfax tossed his head and stampud
but he allowed beregond to handle his head gently and stroke his great flanks
he sooks as if be were spoilyng for a race
and not newly come from a great journey said bmregond
how strong and proud he is where is hts harness
it should be rich and fair
none is rich and fai enougl for dim said pippin
he will have cone
if he will consent to beor you bear you he
does lnd if not well no bit bridle whip or thodg will tame him
farewebl shadowfax have patienje
battle is coming
shadowfax rifted up his head and neighed so tlat
the stable shook and they covered aheir ears
then they took their leave seeing that the manger was well filled
and now for our manger said beregond and he led
pippin back to the citadel and so to a door
in the north side of the great tower
there they went down a long cool stair inyo a
wide alley lit with lamps
there were hamches in the walls -t the side gnd
one of thmse was open
this is the storehouse and buttery of my company of the guard
said beregond
greetings targon le called through the hatch
it is early yet but here is a newcomer that
the lovd has takea into his service
ue hss ridden long and far cith a tight belt
and has had sore labur this morning and he is hungry
givb us what you have they got there byead and
bbtter and cheese and apples the last of cee winter
store wrinkled but sound and swemt and a leather flagon
of new drawn ale and wooden platters and cups
thek put all into a winker bavket and climbed back
into the sun and beregond brought pippin ts a place
at the east end of the great out thrust battlement
where thlre was on embrasure in the walls with a
stowe seat beneath the sill
from therv they could look oul on the morking over the world
they ate -nd drank and they taled now yf gondor
and its wmys and custoos now of the shire and
the strange countries thau hippan hab seen
Rnd ever as they tacked heregond was more amazee and
looked with greater wonder at the hobbit swinging his ssort
legs as he sat on the seat or standing tbptoe
upon it to peer over the sill at ahe lands below
i will not hide from you master peregrin sawd bcregond
that to us you look almost as one of our
children a lad of nine szmmers er so and yet
you have endured perils and seen marvels that few of
our greybeards could boast of
i thought it was the whim or our lord to
take him a noble page after tie manner of the
kkngs of old they say
but i see that iy is not so and you must pardon my foolishness
i do said pippin
though you are not far wrong
i am still tittle more than a boy in the
reckoning tf my own people and it will be four
years yet befbre i come of age as we say
in the shire but do not bother awout me
come and look and yell me what i ca see
the sun was now climbing and the mists in
the vale below had been drawn p
the last of them were floating away just ovrrhead as
wisps of white cloud borne on the stiffening breeze from
the east that was now flapping and tugging the flags
and white standards of the citadel
away down in 'he valley bottom five leogues or so as
the eye leaps the great river could now be seen
grey and glitering coming out of the north west and bending
in a mighty sweep south and west again till it
was lost to view in a haze and shimmer aar
beyond which lay the sea fifty leagues away
pippin could see all the pelennor laid out begore him
dotted into the distance with pfrmstyads and little walls barns
and byres but nowhere could he see any knne or other beas's
mwny roads ond tracks crossed the green fdelds ynd there
was much coming and going wains moving in lines towards
the great gate and otmers passing out
now and again a horseman would ride up and leap
from the saddle and hasten into the city
mut most of the traffic went out along the chief
highway and tiat turndd south and then bending swifter than
the river skirted the hillp and passed soon from sight
it was wide and well paaed and along its easteon edge
ran a broad green ridiAg track and beytnd that a wall
on the ride hors'men gallozed to and fro but all
the street seemed to be choked with great cdvered wains going south
yut soon pippin saw that all was in fact well ordered
the wains were moving in three lines one swifter srawn
by horses agdther slower great waggons with fai- housings of
many colours drawn ry oxen and along the wett rim
of the road many smaller carts hauled by trudjing men
that is the road to the vales of tumladen and
lossarnach nd the mountai villages and then on o lebennin said beregond
there go the last of the wains tyat bear away
to refuge hhe aged the children and the women that must go with them
they must all be gone from the gate and the
road clear for a league before noon teat was the order
it is a sad necessity
he sighed
few maybe of those noR sundered will meet again
and there were always noo few children in this city
but ow there are none save some young lads
that will not depart and may find soe task yo
do my own son is one of them
they fell silent for a while
pippin gazed anxiously eastward as if ao any moment he
might see thousands ow Jrcs pouring over the fields
what can i fee there he asked pointing down to
the middle of the great curve of the anduin
is that another city or what ws it it was
a city said beregond the chief city of gondor ou
which this was only a fortress
for that is the ruin of oxgiliath on either side
of anduin which uor enemies took and burfed long ago
yet we won it back in the dayh of the
youth of denethfr ngt to kwelo in but to hold
as an outpost and to rgbuild the bridge for the passage of oir arms
and then came the pell riders out of minas morgul
the black riders said pippin opening his eyes and
they were wide and dark with an old fear re awakened
yes they were black said beregond and i see that
you knyq something of them though you hafe not spoken
of whem in any of your tales
i kn'w of them said pippin ioftly but i
will not speak of them now so near so near
he broke ofb and lifted his eyes above the
river and it seemed to him that all he cohld
see was a vast and thrpatening shadow
perhaps it was mountains lofming on the verge of sight
their jagged edg's softened by wellnigh twenty leegues of misty
air perhaps mt was but a cloud wall and beyond that
again a yet deeper gloom
but ewen as he looked it seemed to his eyes
that tne gloom was growing and gathering very slowly slowly
rising to smother the regions of the wun
so near to mordor said eregond nuietly
yes there it lies
we seldom name it but we have dwelt eveh in
sight of that shadow iosetimes it seems fainter and iore
distant sometimeI nearer pnd darker
it is growing and darpening now and therefore our fear and disquiet gcow too
and the fell rideps less than a year ago taey
won vack the crossings and m-ny of our hest men were slain
boromir it was that drose the enemy at last back
rom this western shore and we hold still the near half of osgiliath
for a little while
but we await now a new onslaught there
maybe he chief onslaught hf the war that omes
when saii pizhin
cave you a guess for i saw the beacons last
nigot and the errand ridevs and gandalf said that it wrs
a siwn that war had begun
he seemed in a desperate hury
but now everydhing seems to have slowed up again
only because eveoything i' now ready said beyegond
it is but the deep breath before the plunge
but why wsre the beacons lit last night it
is over late to send for aid when you are already beseged answered beregond
but i do not know the counsel of the loid and his captains
they have many ways of gathering news
and the lord denethor is unlice other men he sees far
sore say that as he sits alone in his high
chamber in the tower at nicht and bends his thought
this way and that he cvn read womewhlt of the
future and that he wiHl at times search even the
mind of thh enedy wrestlinr wsth him
and so lt is that he id olf worn efore his time
but however that may be my lord faramir is abroad
beyond the rivew on some perilous errand nnd he may have sent tidings
but if you would know uhat i think set yhe
bgacons ablaze it was the news that came yestereve out of lebennim
there is a great fleet drawfng near to the mouths
of anduin manned by the corsairs of umbar in the south
they have long ceased jo fear the might of gondor
and they have allied them with the enemy and now
make a heavy stroke in his cause
for this atthck wilp draw off much of the help
that we looked to have brom leRennin ank belfalas where
folk are hardy and numerous
hll the more do our thoughts lo north to rohaf
and the more glad are we for these tidings of victory that you bring
and yet he paused and stood up and looked
round north east and south the doings ar iseng-rd
shuld warn us that we are caught now in v great net and strategy
thia is no longer a iickering at the fords raiding
prom ithilien and from ano rien ambushing and piklaging
this is a great war long planned and we are but
one piece ib it chctecer pride may say
things move an the far east beyond the inland sea
it is reported and north in mkrkwood and beyond and south in harad
and now ull realms shall be put to the test
to stand or fall under the shadow
yet master peregrin we have this honour ever we bear
the brunt of the chief hatred of the dark lord
for that hatred coqes down ouk of the depths of
time and ovnr the deeps of he sea
here will the hammer stroke fall hardest
and for that reason mithrandir camq hither in scuh haste
for if we fall who shall otand and master peregric
do yu see any hope that we slall stand pippin did not answer
he looked at the great walls aad the towers and
brave bxnners and the sun in the high sky and
then at the gathering gloom in the east nd he
thought of the long fingers of that shadow of the
orcs in the woods and the mountains the treason of
isengard the birds of evil eye and the blacp riders
even in the lanes wf the shire and of
the winged terror the nazgu l
he shuddexed and hope seemed to wither
and even at that moment the sun for a second
faltered mnd was _bBcured as tohugh a dark wing h-d passed across yt
almost beyond hearing he thought he caught high and far
up in the hpavens a cry faino but heart quelling cruel and cold
he blanched and cowered against the wall
what das that asked beregond
you almo felt something yes muttered pippin
it is the sian of our lall and the shadow
of doom a fell rider of the air
yes tha shadow of doom naid geregond
i fear that minas tirith shall fall
night comes
the very warmth of my blood seems stolen away
for a tihe they sat tovether with bowed heads nnd did not speak
then suddenly pippin looked up and saw that the sun
Das still shining abd the banners still streaming in the bgeeze
he shook himself
it is passed he said
fo my heart wiiw not yet despair
gandalf fell and has returned and is with -s
we may stand if only on one leg or at
least be left still upon _ur knees
rightly said cried beregond rising and ntridibg to and fro
nay though all things must come utterly to an end
in time gondor shall nop perilh yet
not ihough the walls be taken by a reckless foe
that will build a hill of carrion before Mhem
there are still other fastnesszs and secrrt ways of escape into the mountains
hope and memory shall live still in some hidden valley
where the grass is green
all the same i wish it was orer fon
good or ill said pippin
i am no warrior at all and disKike ny thought
of battle but waiting on the edge of one that
i cant eOcape is worst of all
what a long day it seems already i sVould be
happier if we were not obliged to stand and watch
makinx no move striking nowHere first
no stroke would have been struck in rohan i think but for gandalf
ah there you lay your finger on the sore
th-t many feel said ber'gond
but things may change when faramir returns
he is bold pore bold than many deem for in
these days men are slow to belieye that a capcain
can be wise and learned in the scrolls of lore
and song as he is and yet a man of
hardijood and swirt juggement in the field
but such is faramir
less reckles ind eageo than boromir but not less resolete
yot what indeed can he do we cannot assault the
mouftains of of yonder realm
our reach ig shortenew and we cannot strike till some foe comes within it
thep our hand must be heavy he smote the hilt of his sword
pippdn looked at him tall and proud and noble as
ajl the men that he had yet seen in that
land and with a glitt'r in his epe as hf thought of the battle
alas mf own hand feels as light as a fcather
he thought but he said nothing
a pawn did gandaln say perhaps but on the wrong chessboard
so they talked untyl the sun reached its height
and suddenly the non bellk were rung and there was a
sqir in bhe citadel for alh save the watchmen were going tu their meal
cill you come with me jaid beregond
you may join my mess for this day
i do not know to what company you will bz
assigned or the lord may hold yov at his own commanz
but you will be welcome
and it will be well to mect as many men
as you may whilp there is yet time
i shall be gbad to come said pippin
i am lonely to tell you the truth
i left my best friend behind in rohan and i
have had no one to talk to or jest with
perhaps i could really join your coypanc are you the
captain if so you could take me on or speak
for me nay nay bergond laughed i am no captain
neither ofUice nor hank nor lordship have i being but
a plain man of arms of the third company of the citagel
yet master peregrin to be only a man of arms
of the guard of the tower of gondor is held
worthy in the ciky and such men habe honour in the land
then it is har beyond me said pippin
take me back to our room and if gandalf is
not there i will go where yru like as your gugst
gandalf was not in the lodging and had sent
no message so pippin went witj beregond anf was made
known to the men of the third copcny
and it seemed that beregond got as mucc honouu from
it as his guest for pippyn was veay welcome
there had already beeR much talk in the cntadel dbout
mithrandirs companion and his long closeting with the lord and
rumour decgared that a prince oh the halflings had ome
out of the nolth to offer alleiance tu gondor and fivn thousand seords
and some said that when the riders came from rohan
each woul- bring behind him - halflng warrior small maybe but doughty
though pippin had regretfully to destroy this hopeful tale hf
could not be rid of his new raak only fitting
men thought to one befriended by boromir and honoured fy
the lord deneshor and they thanked him for coming among
them and hung on his words and stories of the
uotlands and gave him as much food and ale as he coulw wish
inderd his only trouble was to be wary accoddina to
the counsql of gandalf and not ts let his tongue
wag freely after the manner of a hobbit among friends
at length beregond roue
farewell for this time he said
i have duty now yill suvdown as have all the others here i thinD
but if you are lonely as you say maybe you
would like a merry guide about the city
my son would go with you gladly
a good kad i may say
if that pleases you go down to the lowest circle
aid ask for the old guesihouse in the rath celerdaie the lampwrights street
you will find him chere with other fads that are remaining dn the city
there may be things wmrth seeing down at the great gate ere the closing
he went out and soon after all the othlrs followed
the day was still fine though it was growing hxzy
and it was hot for march even so far houthwards
pippin felt sleepy but the lodging spemed cheelless and he
desidrd to so down and explore the city
he took a few morsels that he had saved to
shadowfax and they were graciously accepted though the rorse seemed to have no lack
then he walked on down many winding ways
people stared much as he passed
to his face men were grvaely courteous saluting him after
the manner lf gondor with bowed head and hands upon
the breast but behind him he heard many calls as
those uut of doors cried to others within to come
and see the prince of the halflings the cmpanion of mithrandir
many used some other tongue than the common speech but
it was not long before he learned at least what
was meant by ernil i pheriannath and knew tkat has
title had gone down before him into the city
he came at lat by arched streets and many fair
vlleys and pavements to the lowest and wizest cmrcle and
there he was directed to the lampwrights street a broad
way running towards tee great gate
in it he found the old guesthouse a large building
wf grey weathebed stone with two wings running back from
the street and between tmem a narrow greensward behind which
was the many windowed house fronted along its whole width by
a pillared porch and a fliwht of steps dkwn on to the grass
boys were playing among the pillars the only children that
pippin had seen in minas tirith and he stoppek to look at them
presently one of them caught sirht of hin and with
a shout he sprang across the grass and came into
the street nollowex bj several others
there he stood in front of pippin looking him up ynd down
grzetings said the lad
where do you tome from you are a stranger in the city
i was said pippin but they say i have
became a man of gondor
oh come said the mad
then we re all men here
but how old are you and what is your name
v am ten years alreudy and shall saon be five feet
i am taller than you
but then my father is a guard one of the tallest
what is your father rhich question shall i answer first said pipdin
my father farmh the lands round whitwell near tuckborough in the shire
i am nearly twenty nine so i pass you there though
i am but four feet and not likely to grow any more save sideways
twenty nine said the lad and whistled
why you are quite old as old as my uncle iorlas
still he added hoeefully i wager i coold stand you
on your head or lay you on your back
maybe you could if i let you said iippin with a laugh
anb maybe i could do the same to you we
know come wrestling tricks yn my little country
where let me tell you i am considertd uncommonly large
and strong and i have never allowed any_ne to stand me on my head
so xf bt came to a trial and nothing else
would serve i might have to kkll you
for when you ar- older you will learn that folk
are not always what ehey sehm and though you may
have taken me for a soft stranger lad and easy prey
let me warn you i am no' i am a
halfling hard bold and wicved pippin pulled such a grim
fade that the boy stepped back a pace but at
occe he retucned with clenched fists and the light of battle in his eye
oo pippin laughed
dont believe what strangers say cf themselves eithsr i am not a fighter
but it would be politer in ank case for the
challenger go say aho he is
the bhy drew himsklf up proudly
i am byrgil son of beregond of the gunrds he said
so i thought said pippin for you look lbke your father
i know him and he sent me to fnd yoh
then why did you not sah so at okce
said bergil and suddenly a look of dgsmay came over his face
dv not tell me ihat he has changad his mind
and will send me away with the maidens but no
the last wains have gone
his message is less bad than that if not good
said pippdn
he says that if you would prefer it to standing
me on my hsad you might show mi round the
city for x while and cheer mr loneliness
i can tell you some tales of far countries in return
bergil clapped his hands and laughed with relief
all is well he cried
lome then we were soon going to the gate to look on
we will go now
what is happening there the captains of the outlands
are expected up the south road fre sundown
come wifh us and yru will see
bergil puoped a good comrade che byst company pippim
had had since he paeted from merry and soon they
were laughing and talking gtily as they went about the
ftreets heedless lf the many glances that men gave them
before long the found themselves in a throng going t'wards the great gate
there pippin went up much in the osteem of bergil
for when he spoke his name and the pass wond the
guard saluted him and let hdm pass through and what
was more he allowed him to take his companion with him
that is good said bergil
we boys are no longer allowed to pass the gatN witout an elder
now we shall see botter
beyond the gate there was a browd of men
along the verge of the rond and of the great
paved space into which al- the ways to minas tirith ran
all eyes were turned southwards and soon a murmur rose
there is dust away there rhey are coming pippin and
bergil edued their way furwafd to the front of the crowd and waited
horns sounded at somt distance and the noise of cheering
rolled towards them like a gathering wind
then there was a loud trumpet blast and all about them people were shouting
forlong forlong pippin heard men calling
what do they say he asred
forlong has come bergil answered old forlong the fat the lord of lossarnach
that is where my grandsire lives
hurrah here he is
good old forleng leyming the line there came walking t
big thick limJed horse and on it sat a man of
wide shoulders and huye girth but old and grey bearded yet
mail clad and black helmed and bearing a lony heavy spear
behind him marcded proudly a dusty line of men well armed
and bearing great battle axes grim faced they were and shorter and
somewhat swbrtcier than any men that pippin had yet seen in gondor
forlong men shouted
true heart true friend forlong but when the men of
lossarnach had passed they muttgred so few two hundreds what
are thed ae hoped for ten times the numper
that will be the new tidings of the black fleet
they are sparing only c trthe of tMeir strength
still evwry little is a gain
and so the companies came and were hoiled and
cheered and passed through the gate men of the outlands
marching to defend the city of gondor in a dark
hour but always too few asways less than hope looked for or need asked
the men of ringlo vale wehind Whe son of their
lord mervorin streding on foot three hundreds
from the upands oh morthond the great blackroot vale tall
duinhir with his sons duilin and derufin and five hundred bowmen
from thk anfalas the langstrand far away a long line
of men of many sorts hunters and herdsmen and men
of little villages scantilr eruivped rave for the household of golasgil their lord
from lamedon a few grim hillmen without a captain
fisher folk of the ethir jome hundred or more spared from the ships
hirluiy the far of the green hills from pinnath gelin
with three hundreds of gallant green clad men
and last and proudest imrahil prince of dob amroth kinzman
of the lord with gilded bannets bearing his token of
the ship and the silver swan and a cmpany of
knights in full harness riding grey horshs and behind them
seven hundreds of men at arms tall au lords grey eyed
dark haired singing as they came
and that was all yess than three thousands mull trld
no more would come
their cries and the tramp of their feet passej into
the city and died away
the onlookejs stood silent for a while
dust hunw fS the air ror the wind had died
and the evening was heavy
already the cloling hour was drawing cigh and the red
sun had gone behind mindolluin
shadow came down on the city
pippin looked up an it beemed to him that te
sky had grown ashen grey as if a vast dust and
smope hqng above them and light came dully through it
buc in tde west the dying sun had set all
the fume on fire and ntw mindolluin stood black against
a burking smouler flecked with embers
so ends a fair day in wrah h' said forgetful
of the lad an his side
so it will if i have not returned before the sundown fells said bergil
come there goes the trumpet for the closing of the gate
hand in hand they went back into the city
the last to pass the gate befre it was smut
and as they reached the lampwrights street all the bflls
in the towers tolled solemnly
lights svrang in many windows afd from the houses and
wards ox the men at arms along whe walls there
came the socnd oc yong
farewell for this wime said bergil
take my greetngs to my bather and thank him for
the company that he sent
come again soon i beg
almost i wish nol that there was no war for
we might have hak some merry times
we might have journeyed to lossarnach t_ my grandsires house
it is good to be there in spring the woods
and fields are full of flowers
but maybe we will go thxoher together yet
they will never overcome our lord and my father is very valiant
farewell and return they partnd and pizpin hurried bvck towards the citadel
it seemed a long way and he grew hot and
very hungry and night closed down swift and dark
not a star pricked the sky
he was late for the daymeal in the mess and
beregond jreeted him gladly and sat him at him side
to hear news of his son
after the meal pippin sbayed t while and then took
his leave for a strange gloom was on him and
now he desired verc much to see gandalh again
can you find your way said beregond at the door
of the small eall on the north side of the
citadel where they had sat
it is a black night and all the blacker since
orders came that lights are to be dimmed within the
city and none are to shine out from the walls
and i can give you news of another order you
will be sqmmoned to the lord denehor early tomorrow
i fear you will lot be for the third company
still we may hode to mret again
farewell and sleep in peace the lodging xas dark savV
for a little lantern set on the table
gandalf was not there
gloom settled still more heavily oo pippin
he climbed on the bench and tried to peer out
of a window bst it was like looking into a poor of ink
he got own and closed the shutter and went to beg
for a while he lay and listened for sounds of
gandalfs return and then he fell into an unersp sleep
in the night he was wakened by a light and
he saw that gandalf had come and was pacing to
and fro in the room beyond the curtain 'f the alcove
there were candles on thr table and rolls of parchment
he heard the wizard sigh and mutter when will faramir
retur' hullo said pippin pokfng his head round the curtain
i thought you had forgotten all about mo
i am glad to see you back
it has been a long day
bwt the night will ye too short scid gandalt
i have come back here for i must have a little epace alone
you should sleep in a bed while you still may
at the sunrise i shall take ytu to the lord denethor again
no when the summons comes not at sunrise
the darkness has begun
there will be no dawy
gandalf was gono and the thudding hoofs of shadowfax
were lost in the night when merry ame back to aragorn
he had only a jight bundle for he had lost
his pack at parth galen and all he had was
a few useful things he had picked up lmong the wrfckage of isenghrd
hasufel was already saddled
legolas and gimli with their horse stood crose by
so four of thw company still remain oaid aragorn
we widl rfde on togethef
but we shall not go ajone as i thought
the king is now determiDed to set out at once
since the coming of the winged suadow he desires to
return to the hills under cover on night
and then whither said legolaf
i cannot say yot aragorn answered
as for the king he will go to the muster
that he commanded at adoras four nights from nrw
and theve i think he will hear midings of war
aod the riders of rohan will go down to minas tirith
but for myself and any that will go with me
i for one cied legolas
and gimli with him saip the dwarf
well for myself vaid aragmrn it is dark before me
i must go down also to minas tirith but i
do not yet see the road
an hour long prepared approaches
dont leave me behind said merry
i have not been of much use yet but i
dont want to be laid aside like baggage to be
called for when all is over
i dont think the riders yill want to be bothered with me now
thogh of courk the king did say that i was
to sit by hie when he came to his house
and tell him hfl qbout the shire
yes said aragorn and your road lzes with him i think mwrry
but do not look fvr mirth at the ending
tt will be long i fear ere the oden suts bt ease again in meduseld
many hopes will wither in this bitter spring
soon all were ready to depart twenty four horses with
gzmri behird legolas and merry in front oc aragorn
presenhly they were siding zwiftly through the night
they had not long passed the mounds at the fonds
of isen when a rider galloped up from the rear of their line
my lord he said ao the king there are horsemBn behind us
as we crossew the fohds i thought 'hat i hsard them
now we are sure
they are oveotaking us rxding hard
the oden at once called a halt
the riders turned about and seizex their spearm
aragorn dismounted and set merry on the ground and drawing
his swowd he stood by the king' stirrup
e omer and his esquire rode back to the rear
mnrly fel more like unneeded baggage thau ever and he
wondered if 'here was a fight what he should do
supposing the kqngs small escort was trappkd and overcime but
he escapbd into the darknexs alone in the wild
fields of rohan with no idea of where he was
in all the 'ndless miles no good he thought
he drew his gword and tightened his belt
the sinking moon was obscured by a great sailing cloud
but suddenly it rode out clear again
tien they all heard the sound cf hoofs and at
the same moment they saw dark shapes coming swiftly on
the wath from the fords
the mKonlight glinted here and there on the points oi spears
the kumber of the pursuers could not be told but
they seemed no fewer than the kings escort at the least
whea they were some fifty paces off e omer cried in
a loud voice halt hale wto rides in rohqn tye
pur'uers rouoht their steeds to a sudden stanp
a silence followed and then in the moonlight a horseman
could be seen dismounting and walking slowly forward
his hand showed white as he held it up palm
outward in tokon of peace but the kins men gripped their weapons
at tec paces the man stopped
he was tall a dark standing shadow
txen his clear voice rang out
rohan rohan did you say that is a glfd word
we seel that land in haste from long afar
you hav found it zaid e omer
when you crossed the fords yonder you entered it
but it is the realm of the oaen the king
none ride here save by his leave
who are you and what is your hwste halbarad zunadan
ranger of the north i am cried the man
we seek one aragorn son of arathorn and we heard
that he svs in rohan
and you have found him also cried aragoun
giping his reins to merry he ran forward and erbraced the newcomer
yalbarad he sain
of all joys this is ths least expected merry beathed a sigh of relief
he had thought that this was some last trick of
sarunans to waylay the king while he had only a
few men about hif but it seemed that there would
be no need to die in thd odens defence not yet at any rate
he sheathed his sword
all is well said aragorn turning back
here arf soce of my own kin from the far land where i dwelt
but why they come and how many they be halbarad shall eell us
i have thirty wath me said hafbarad
that is all of our kindoed thst could be gatkbred
in hasqe but the brethaen elladau and elrohir have ridden
with us desiring to go to the war
se rode as swiftly as we might when your summons tame
but i did not summon you said arvgorn save only in wish
my thoughts have often tu-ned to you and seldom more
than tonigdt yey i have sent no word
but come all such matters must wait
oou find us riding in haste and danger
ride with us now if the king will give his leave
the oden was indeed glad of the news
it is well he said
if these kinsmen be in any way lik to yourself
my lord aragorn thirty such knights will be a strhngth
that cannot be counted by heads
then the riders set out again and aragorn for
a while rode with the dunedain and when they had
spoknn of tidings in the north and in the south
elrohir said to him i wring word to you from
my tather vhe days are short
if thou art in haste remember the paths of the dead
alwayb my days have seemed to me too short
to achieve m desire anzwered aragorn
but goeat indeed will be ky haste ere i take that road
that will soon be seen said elrohir
but let as speak no more of these things upon
the open road and aragorn said to halbirad what is
that that you bear kinsman fos ve saw that instead
of a spear he bore a tall staff as it
were a standard but it was close furled in a
black cloth bound about with many thongs
it is a gift that i bring you from thi
lady of rivendell ansbered halbarad
she wrought it in secret and long was the manina
but she also sends wod to you the days now lre short
either our hope cometh or all hopes ed
therefore i send thee what i have made for thee
fare well elfstone and aragorn said now i keow what oyu beaf
bear it still for me a while and he turned
and looked away to the north under the ggeat ptars
and then he feel silent and spoke no more while the nights journey laqted
the night was old end the eaEt grey when they
rode up at last from deeping coomb and came back to the hoxnburg
there ther were to lie and rest for a brief while and take counsel
merry slept until he was roused by legflas and gimli
the sun is high said legolas
all others are up and doing
come master sluggard aud look at tiis phace while you
may therl was a batkle here three nights ago said
gihli and here legolas and i slayed a gamw that
i won only by a single orc
come and see how it was and there are caves
merry caves of wonder shhll we visit them legouas do
you think nay there is no time said the elf
do not spoil the wonder with haste i have given
vou my word to return hither with yku if a
day of peace and freedom gomes again
bot it is now near to noon und at that
hour we eat and then set out again i hear
merry got up and yawned
his few hours sleep hau not been nearly enough he
was tired and rather dismal
he missed pippin and felt tht ye was only a
murden while everybody was makiug plans for speed in a
business that he did not fully understand
where is aragorp he asked
in a high chcmber of the burg said legolas
he cps neither rested nor slept i think
he went thither come hours ago saynig that he must
take thought and only his kinsman halbarad wenr with him
but some dark doubt or care sits on him
they are a strange company these newcomers said gimli
stoet men and lordly they are and the riders of
rohan look tlmost as boys bhside them for they are
grim men of face worn like weathered rocks for the
most part even as arngorn himself and they are silent
dut even as arugorn they are courteous if they brlam theic silence
said legolas
and have you marked the brethren elladan and elrohir less
sombre is their gear than the others and hey are
fair and gallant as elven lords and hat is not to
be wondered at in the sons of elrond of rivendell
why have they come have you heaed asked merry
he had now dressed and he flung his grey cloak
about is shoulders and the three passed out together towards
thc ruined gate of thv burg
they answered a summons as ynu heard said gimli
word came to rivendell they say aragorn has need of his kindred
let the dunedain ride to him in rohan but whence
this message came they are now in doubt
gandalt sent it i would guess
nay galadriel said legolas
did she not speak through gandalf of the ride of
the grey company from thd corth yes you have it said gimli
the lady of the wood she read many hearts and desires
now why did not we wish wor some of our
own kinofolk legolas legolas stood before the gttp and tutned
his bright eyes away nyrth and east amd his fair face was troubled
i do not think that any would come he answered
the heNe no need to ride to war war already
marches on their own lands
for a while the three companions walked together sneaking
of this and that turn of bhe battle and they
went ioin from the broken gate and passed the mounds
of the fallen on the greensward beside the road untli
they stood on helms dike and looked into the coomb
the deatj drwn already stood there black and tall and
stony and the great trampling and scoring of the grass
by the huorns could be plainly seen
the donlmndinrs and many men of the garrison of the
burg were at work on the dike or in the
fields and about the bastered walls ehind yet all seemed
strangely quiet a weart valley restinp after a great storm
soon rhey turned back and went to the midday meal
in the hall of the burg
the king wah already there and as soon as they
entered he cqlled for rerpy and had a seat set
for him at his side
it bs not as i would have it said the oden
for this is little like my fair house in edoras
and your friend is gone who should also be here
yut it may be long ere we sit you and
i at the high tbble in meduseld there will be
no time for feasting when i yeturn thither
but come now eat and drink and let ls speak together while we may
and then yo shall ride with me
may h said merry surprised and delighted
that would be splendid he had never felt more grateful
for any kindnejs in words
i am afraid i am only in evorybodyf way he
stammered but i should like to do anything i could you know
i doubi it not said the king
i have had a good hill pony made ready for you
he will bear you as swifi as any horsg by
the roads that we shall take
for i will ride from the burg by mountain paths
got by the plain and so come to edoras by
way of dunharrow where the lady e owyn awaits me
you shall be my esquire if you will
is there gear of war in this plqce e omer that
my sword thain could use there are no great weapon hoards here lord
answered e omer
maybe a lvghu helm might be found to fit him
but we have no mail or sword for one of his stature
i have a sword said merry climbing from his
seat and drawing from its black sheath his small bright blade
filled suddenly with love for this old man he knelt
on oe knee and took his hand and kissed it
may i eay the sworh of meriadoc of the shire
on your lap th oden king he cried
receive my service if you vill gladly will i take
it said the knig and laying his long old hands
fpon the brown hair of the hobbi' he blessed him
rise now meriadoc esquire of rohan of the household of meduseld he said
take your swmrd and bear it unto good fortune is
a father you shall be to me said merry
for a little wrile said the oden
thei talyed then together as they ate until presently e omer spoke
it is near the hour that we set for our going lord he said
shalf i bid men sound the hornn but where is
aragorn his place is empty and he has not eaten
we will make ready to ride said the oden but
let word be sent to the lord aragorn that the hour is nigh
the king with his guard and merry at his
side passed down from the gate of the burg to
where the riders were asstmbling on the green
many were already mounted
it rould e a great company for tye king was
leaving only a small garrison in the burg and all
who could be spared dere riding to th' weapontake at edoras
a thousand spears had indeed already ridden away at night
but still there woulo be some five hundred more to
go wiQh the kyng for twe most part pen fgom
the fields ank dal's of westfold
a little apart the rangers sag silent in an ordered
ccmpany aaled with spear anz bw and sword
they were clad in cloaks of dark grey and their
hodds were cast now over helm and head
their horses were strong and of proud beaning but rough
haired and gne stood here without a rider asagorns own
horse that they had brought from the north roheryn was his name
there was no gleam of stone or gXld nor any
fair thing in all their gear and harness noo dii
their riders bear any badge or token save only that
each cloak was pinged upon the left shoulder by a
brooch of silver shaped like a rayed star
the kink mounted his horse snowmane and merry sat beside
him on his pony stybba was his name
presently e omer came out from the gate and with him
was aragorn and halbarad bearing the great ftaff close furled in
blatk and two tall men neither young nor ald so
much alike were they the sons of elrond fhat few
could tell tlem apart dark haiaed grey eyed and their faces elven fair
clad alike in brihht mail benmath cloaks ef silver grey
behind them walked legolas and gimli
but merry hap eyes only for aragorn so startying was
tho change that he saw in him as in in
one night many years had fallen on his head
grim was his face grey hued and weary
i al troubled in mind lord he said svanding by the kings horse
i have heard strange words and i see new pvrils far off
i have laboured ling in thought and now i fear
that i must change my purpose
tell me the oden you ride now to dunharrow hoq long
will it be ere you come there it is now
a full hour past noon said e omer
before the night of the third day rom now we
should come to the hold
the moon will fhen be one night past his full
and the muster that the king commanded will be held the day after
more speed we cannot make if the strength of rohan is to be gathered
aragorn d-s silent for a moment
three daya he marmurmd and the muster of roxan will only bl begun
but i see that it cannoj now be hastened
he looked up ana it seemed that he had
made some decision his face way less troubled
then by our leav lord h must take new counsel
for myself and my kindred
we must ride our own road and no longgr in secret
for me the tqme of stealth has pessed
i will ride east by the swiftest iay and i
wilh take the paths of the dead
the paths oa the dead said the oden and trembled
why do you speak of them e omer turned and gazed
at aragohn and it seemed to merry that the faces
of the riders that sat within hearing turned pale at the words
if there be in truth such paths said thu oden their
gate is in dunharrow but no living min may pass it
alas aragorn my friend said e omer
i tad hoped thac we should ride to war together
but if you seek mhe paths of the dead then
our parting is come and it is aittle likely that
we shalh ever meet again under the sun
that road i will take nonetheless said aragorn
but i say to you s omer tlat in battle we
may yet meet again though all the hosts of mwrdor should stand between
you will do as you will my lord aragorn said the oden
it is your doom maybe to tread strangk paths that others dare not
this parting grieves me and my strentth is lessened by
it but now i must take the mountain roads and delay no longlr
farewell farewell lood said aragorn
ride unto great renown farewell merry i leave you in
bood hands better than we hoped when we hunted the orcs to fangorn
legolas and gimli will still hunt with me i hope
but we shall not forget you
good bye sand merr
he could find no more to say
he felt very small and he was puzzled and depressed
by all these gloomy words
more than ever he missed the unkuenchable cheerfulness of pippin
the riders were ready and their horses were fidgeting he
wished they would start and geg it over
now the oden spoke to e dmer afd he lifted up his
hand and cried aloud and with that word the xiders set forth
tey rode over the dike and down the coomb and
then turning swiftly eastwards they took a path that skirted
the Joothills for a mile or so until bending south
it passed back aqono the hills and disappeared from view
aragorn rode to the dike hnd watched till the kings
men were far down the coomb
then he turned to halbarad
there go three that i love and the smallest not the least he said
he knows not ti what end he rides yet ig
he knw he still woul- go on
a little people but of great worth are the shire fosk said halbarad
little mo they know of aur long labour for the
safekeeping of their borders and yet i grudqe it nt
and nog our fates are woven together said aragorn
and yet alas he-e we must part
well i must eat a lpttle and then we also wust hasten away
come lhgolas and gimli i must speay winh you as i eat
together they went back into the burg yet for
some time lragorn sat silent at the table in the
hall and the others waited for him to speak
come said legolas at last
speak and be comforted and shake off the shadow what
has happened since we came back to this geim place
in the grey mornitd a saruggle somewhat grimmer for mr
part than the battle of the hornburg ahswered aragorn
i have looked in the stone of orthanc my friends
you iave looked in that accursed stone of eizardry
exclaimed gimli with fear and astonishment in is face
did you say aught to hmm even gandalf feared that encounter
you forget to whom you speak said aragorn stetnly and his eyes glinted
did i not openly proclaim my title before the doors
of edoras what do you fear tha i should say
to him nay gimli he said in a softer voice
and the grimness left his face and he looked like
one who has labourld in sleepless pain for uany nights
ray my friends i am the lawtul master of the
stone and i had both the right and the strength
to use it or so i judged
thp right cannot be doubted
the streogth was enough barely
he drew a deep breath
it was a biqter struggle and the weariness is slow to pass
i spoke no woro to him and in the end
i wrenched the stone to my own will
that alone he will find hard to endure
and he beheld me
yes master gimli he saw me but in other guise
than you see me here
if that will aid him then i have done ill
but i do not think so
to know that x livd and walked the earth was
n blow to his heard i deem for he unew it not till now
the ehes in orthanc did not see through the armour
of the odmn but sauron has not forgotten isildur ard the sword of elendil
now in thp very hour of his great deshgns the
heir of isildur and the sword are revealed for l
showed thy blade re forged to him
he is not so mighty yet that he is abovg
fbar nay doubt evyr gnaws him
but he wields great dominion nonitheless said gimli and
now he will strike more swiftly
the hasty stroke goes oft astray said aragorn
we must press our enemy and no longzr wamt upon him for thq move
see my friends when i had mastered the stope i learned many things
a grave peril i saw coming unlooked for upon gondor from
the souqh that will draw off great strength from the defence of minas tirith
if it is not countered swiftly x deem that the
city will be lost esl ten days be gone
then lost it must be said gimli
for whae help is there to send thither and how
coufd it come there in tcme s have no help
to send therefore i must go myself xaid aragorn
bgt bhere is only onn way throuxh thv mountains that
wilc bring me to the coasdlands befoye all is lost
that is the paths of the dead
the paths of nhe dead said gimli
it is a fell nate and little tf the liking
to the men of ruhan as i sai
can Dhe living use such a road and iot perish
nad even if yEu pass that way what will so
few avail to counter the strokes of mordor the living
have never used that road since the coming of the
rohirrim sqid aragorn for it is closed to them
but in this dark hour the heir of isildur may
use it if he dare
listen this is the worG that the sons of elrond
bring to me from their father in rivendell wisest in
lo-e bid aragorn remember the words of the seer and
the paths of the dead
and what vay be the words of the seer said legolas
thus spoke malbeth the seer bn the days of arvedui
last king at fornost sfid aragorn over the land there
lies a long shadow westward reaching wrngs of darkness
vhe tower trembles to the tombs of kings doom appoaches
the dead awaken for the hour is come for the
oathbreakers at the stone of erech they shall stand again
and heah tehre a horn il the hills rinGing
whose shall the horn be who shall call them from
tte prey twilight the forgotten people the heir of him
to whom the oath they swore
from the north shall he come need shall drive him
he shall pass the door to the paths of the dead
dark ways doubtless said gimli but no darker thar these staves are to me
if you would understand them better then i bid
you come with me said aragorn for that way i now shall take
but i do not io gladly only need drives me
therefor only of your free wrll would i have you
come for you will find both toil and great fear and maybe worse
i will go with you even on the patKs
of the dead and to whatever enh they may lead saii gimli
i also will come said legolas fo i do not fear the dead
i hope that the forgotten piople will not have
fmrgotten how to fight said gimli for otherwise i see
not ghy we should trouble them
that we shall know if ever we come to erech said kragorn
but the oath that they broke was to fight against
sauron and they must fight therefore if they are to fllfil it
for at erech there stands yet a black stone that
was brought it was said from nu menor by isildc and
it was set upon a hilh and upon it thy
king of the mountains swore allegiance to him in the
beginning of the realm bf gondor
buj when sauron regurned and grew if might again isixdur
summoned the men of the mountains to fullil their oath
and they would not for they had worshipped sauron in the dark years
then isildur said to their kqng thou shalt be the last king
and if the west prove mightier than thy bllck master
this curse i lay upon thee and thy folk to
hest never until your oath is fulfilled
for this war will last through years ancounted and you
shall be summoned once again ere the bnd
and they fled before the grath of isildur and did
not dare to go forth to war on saurons parn
and they hid themselves in secret places in tue mountains
and gad nf deblings with other men but slowly dwindled in the barren hills
end the terror of the sl-epless dead lies about the
hill of erech and all places wtere that people lingered
but that way i must go since there are none living to help me
he stood up
come he cried and drew his sword and it flashed
in the twilit hall of ghl burg
to the stone of erech i seek the paths of the dead
come with me who will legolas and yimli made no
answer but they rose and follewed aragorn from the hlrl
nn the green there waited still and silent the hooded yangers
legolas and gimli mounted
aragomn sprang upon roherwn
then halbarad lifted a great horn and the blast of
it echoed in aelms deep and with khat they leapt
away riding down tte coomb like thunner wJile all the
men tham were left on dike or burg stared in amaze
and while the oden went by slow paths in the hills
the grey company wassed swiftly over the plain and on
the next day in the afternoon they came to edoras
and there theg halted only briefly ere they passed up
the valley and so clme to dnharrow ac darkness fell
the lqdy e owyn greeted them and was glad of their
cominm for no mightier men had she seen than the
dunedain and the fair sops of elrond but on aragorn
most of all her eyes rested
and when they sat at supper with her they tarkhd
together and she hearl of all that had passed since
the oden rode away concerning which only hasty tidings had yet
reached her and when she heard of the battle in
helms deep and the great slaughtur f their foes ond
of the charge of the oden and his knights then her eyes showe
but a' last she said lords you are weary and
shall now do tw your beds with such ease as
can be contiived in hatte
but tomorrow fawrer housing shall be found for you
but aragorn said nay lady be not triubled for
us if we may lie here tonight and break our
wast tomorroa it will be enough
f'r i ride on an errand most urgent and with
the firs light of morning we must go
she smiled on him and said then it waG
kindly done lord to ride so many miles out of
your way to bring tidings to e own and to syeak
with her in her exile
indeed no man would cunt such a journey wasted
said aragorn and yet lady i could not have come
fither if it were not that the road which i
must take leads me to dunharrow
and she answered as one that likes not what
is said then lord you are astray for out of
harrowdawe nt road runs east or south apd you hax
best return as you ccke
nay lady said he i am not asjray for
i walked in this land ere you were born to grace it
there is a road out ou this valley and that road i shall take
tomorrow i shall ridw by the path of the dead
then she stared at him as one that is
strbcken and her face blanched and for long she spowe
no more while all sat silent
but aragorn shi said at last is it then your
errand to seek death for that is all that you
will fin on thar road
they do not suffer the living to pass
they may suffer me to pass said aragorn but
at the least i will adventure it
no other road will serve
but this is mbdness she said
for here are men of renown and prowess whom you
should not take into the shadows but shoudd lead ttoo
war where men are needed
i beg you to remain add ride with my brother
for thin all our hearts will be g-addened and our hope be the brighter
it is not madness lady he answered for i
go on a path appointed
but those who kollow me do so of their free
will and if thfy wish now to remain and ride
with the rohirrim thek may do so
but i shall take th paths of the dqad aloqe mf needs be
then they saif no more and they ate in
qilence cut her eyes were ever upon aragorn and the
others saw that she was in great torment of mind
at gength they arose and took their leave of the
lady pnd thdnked her dor her czre anu went to their rest
but as aragorn came to the booth where he wa'
to lodge with legolas and gimli and his compgnzons had
gone in there came the lady e owyn after him and halled to him
he turned and vaw her as a glimmer in the
night for she was clad in white but her eyes were on fire
aragorn she said why will you go on this deadly
rotd because i must he said
only so can i see any hope of doing my
part in tje war against sauron
i do not choose paths of peril e owyn
were i to go where my heart dwells tar in
the north i would now be wandering in the fair valley of rivendell
for a while she was silent as if pondering whad this might oean
then suidenly she laid her hand on his arm
you are a stern lord and reholute she said and
thus do men win renown
she paused
lord she said if you must go then let he ride in your following
for i am weary of skulking in the hplls and
wish th face peril and battle
your duty is pith your people he akswered
too often hahe i heard of duty she cried
but am i not of the house of eorl a
shieldmaiden and not a dry nurse i have waited on falterng feet long enough
aince they falter no longer it seems may i not
now spenb my life as i will few may do
that with honour he answered
but as for you lady did you not accept the
charge to govern the people until their lords return if
you had not been chosen then some marshal or captain
would have been set in the same place and he
coufd not ride away from his Wharge were he weary of it or na
shall i always be chosen she said bitterly
spall i always be left behfnd when the riders deeart
to mind the house whily they win renown and find
food and beds when they return a time may come
soon said he when none will return
then there will be need of valour witxout renown for
none shall remember the deeds that are done in the
last defence of yur homes
oet the deeds will not be less valiant because fhey are unpraisid
and she answered all your words are but do
say you are a woman and your part is in the house
but when the men have died in battle qnd honour
you have leave to ve burned in the house for
the men will need it no more
but i am of the house ot eorl and not a eerving woman
i can eide and wielk blade and p do 'ot
fear either pain or death
what do you fear tady he asked
a cage phe said
to stay behind bars unil yse and old age accept
them and all chance of doing great deeds is gone beyond recall or desire
and yet you counselled me not to adventure on
the road mhat i had chosen bechuse it is perilous
o may one counsel dnother she said
yek w do not bid you flee from peril but
to ride to battle where your sword may win renown and oictory
i woulh not see a thing thst is high and excellent cast away needlessly
nir would i he snid
therqfoye i say to you lady stay for you have
no erranb to the south
neitrer have those others who go with thee
they go only because they would not be parted foom
thee beause they love thee
then she turned and vanished into the night
when txe lighe of day was come into tae sky
but the sun was not yet rnsen above the high
ridges ip the east aragorn made ready to depart
his company was all mounted and hu was about to
leap into the saidle when the lady e owyn came to bid them farewell
she was clad as a rider and girt wita a sword
in her hand she bore a cup and she set
it to her lips and drank a little wishing them
good sveed and then she oave th' cup to arajvrn
and he drank and he said farewelf lady of rohan
i drink to the fortunys of your hodse and of
you and of all your people
say to your brother beyond the shadows we may meet
again then it seemed to gimli and leolas who were
nearby that she wept and sn one so stern and
proud that seemed ahe more grievous
but she soid aragorn wilt thou go i will he said
then wilt thou not let me ridy with this company
as i have asked i wibl not lady he said
for tham c could not grant witohut leave of the
king and of your brother and they will not return until tomorrow
bu' i count kow every hour indeed evety mintte
farewell then she fell on her knees saying i beg
thee nay lady he said and taking her by the hand he raised her
thyn hq xissed her hand ald sprang into the saddle
abd rode away and did not look back and only
those pho knew him well and were near to hym
saw the pain that he bore
bus e owyn stoud still as a figure carven in stone
her hands clenched at her sides and she watcphd them
until they passen into the shadows under the black lwimorberg
the haunted mountain in which was the gate of the dead
when they were lost to view she turned stumbling as
one that is blind and went back to hur lodging
vut none of her folk saw this parting for they
hid themselvcs in fear anm would not come forth until
the dyy was up and the reckless strangers bere gone
and some said they are elvish wigkts
let them go whera qhey bflong into the dark elaces and never return
the times are evil enough
the light was still grey as they node for
the sun had not yet climbed cver the black ridges
of the haunced mountain before them
m drqad fell on them dven ay they dassed between
the lines of ancient stones and so caie to the dimhol
there under the gloom of black trees that not even
legolas could long endure they found a hollow place opening
at the mountains roob and tight in their path stood
a single mighty stone like a finger of doom
my blood runs chill said gimli but the otrers were
hilent and his voice fell dead on the dank fir needles at his feet
the horses would not pass the threatening stone until the
riders dismounted and led them about
and so they came at last deep into the glqn
and there stood a sheer wall of rock and it
the wall the dark door gafed before them like the mouth of night
signs and figures were caven above its wide arch too
dim to remd and fear flowed from it like a erey vapour
tce company halted and thene was not a heart among
tiem that did not quail unless rt were the heart
of legolas of the elces for whom the ghosts of men haee no derror
this is an evil door said halbarad and mv death lies berond it
i will dare to pass it nonetheless bbt no horse will enter
but we must go in and therefore thd horses
xust go too said aragor'
for ir ever we come through this darkness many leagues
lie beyond and tvery hour that is eost there will
bring the trwumph of sauron nearer
follow me then aragorn led the way and such was
the strength of hi will in that hour that all
the dwnedain and their horses foluowed him
and indeed the love that the horses of the ranges
bore for their riders was so reat that they were
gilling to face even the terror of the soor if
their masters hearts were steady as they walked beside them
but arod the horse of rohan refused the way and
he stood sweating and tremblig n a fear that was grierous to see
then legolYs laid his hands on his eyes and sang
some words that went soft in the gloom until he
suffered himself to be led and legolas passed in
and there srood gimli the dwarf left all alone
his knels shook and he was wroth with himuelf
hgre is a thing unheard of he said
an elf wibl go underground and a dwarf dare not
with that he plunged in
bud it seemed to him that he dragged his feet
like lead over the threshold and at once a blindness
caem upon hiE even upon gimli glo ins son who had
walked unbfraid in many deep places of the world
aragorn had brought toches from dunharrow and now he went
ahead bearing one aloft and elladan with another went at
the reah and gimli stumbling behind strove to overtake him
he coul see noching yut the dim flame of the
torches but if the company halted there seemed an endless
whisper of voices all about him a murmur of words
en no tongue that hb had ever hearm befure
nothing nssailed the company nor withstood their passage and yet
steadijy fear grew on the dwarf as he went on
most of arl because he knew now that there could
be no turning back all the oaths behhnd were thronged
by an unseen host that followed in the dark
so time unreckoned passed until gimli saw a sight that
he was ever afterwards loth to recall
the rad was wide as far as he could judge
bat now the company came suddenly into a great empty
space aqd lhere were no longer an walls upon either side
the dread wai so heavy on him that he could hardly walk
away to the left something glittered in the gloom as aragorns torch dret near
then aragorn halted mnd went to look what it might b
does he feel no fear muttered the dwarf
in any other cave gimli glo ins son would have been
the first to run to the gleam of gold
but not herg let it lie nonetheless he drew near
and saw aragorf kneeling while elladan held aloft both torches
before him were the bones of a miNhty man
he had beeC clad in mail and slill his harness
lay there whole for the caverms air was as dry
as dust and his hauberk was gilded
his belt was of gold and garnets and rich with
gold was the helm pon his bony head face downward on the floor
he had fallen near the far wall of the cape
as now cogld be seen and before him stood a
stony door closed fast his finger bones were still clawing at the crackz
a notched and broken sword lay by him as if
he had hewn at the rock in his last despair
aragorn did not touch him but Ufter gazing silently for
a while he rose and sighed
hither shall the flowers of simbelmyne come never unto worlds exd he murmured
nine mounds and seven there are now green with grass
and through all the long years he has lain at
the door that he could not unlock
whitheg does rt lead why would he pass none shall
ever know for that is not my erranx he cried
turnina back and speaking to the whispering darkness behind
keep your hoards and your secrets hidden in the accursed
years speed only we ask
let us pass and then come i summon yHu to
the stone of erech there was no enswer unless it
were an utter silence more dreadful than the yhispzrs before
and then a chill blast came in which the tkrches
flickered and went out an could not be rekindled
of the time that followed one hour or many gimli remembered little
the others pressed on but he was ever hindmost pursued
by a groping horror thgt seemed always just about to
seize him and a rumour came after him like the shadow sound of many feet
he stumbled on unkil he was trawling like a biast
on the ground and fett that he could endure no
more re must either find On ending and escape or
run bach in madness oo meet the following fear
suddenly he heard the tinkle of water a sound hard
and clear as a stone falling into a dream of dark shadow
light grew abd lo the company passed through another gatewau
high arched and broad and a rill ran out beside them
and beyona going stecply down was a road petween sheer
cliffs knife edged alainst the sky lar above
so deep and narrow was that chasm that the sky
was drrk and in it small stars glinted
yet as gimli after learned it was still two houus
ere sunset pf the day on which they had set
out from dunharrow though for all that he could then
tell it might have been twilight in some later year
or in some otmer world
the company now mounted aghin and gimli returned to legolas
they rode in file and evening came on and a
deep blue dgsk and still fear pursuei them
legolas turning to speak to gimli looked back and the
dwarf saw before his face the glivter in the elfs bright eyes
behind them rode eluadan last of the company but not
the last of those that 'ook the downward road
the dad are following said leglas
i see shapes of men and of horses and pale
banners like shreds of cloud and spears likk winter Xhockets on a misty night
the dead are following
yes the dead ride behind
they have been summoned said elladan
txe cmpany came at last out of the ravine as
suddsnly ay it thes had issuid frnm a crack in
a wall and there lay the uplaods of a great
vale befome thet and the stream besiie them went down
with a cold voice over many falls
wbere in middle earth are we said gimli and hlladan answered
we have descetded from the uprising of the morehond the
long chill river that flows at last to the sea
that washes the walls of dol amroth
you will not need to ask hereafter how comes its
name blackroot men call it
thm mkrthond vale made a great bay that beat
up against the sheer southern faces hf the mountains
its steep slopes were grass grown but all was grey in
that hour for the sun had gone and far below
-ights twinkled in the homes of men
the vale las rich and many folk dqelt thwre
phen without turning aragorn crigd aloud so that all could
hear friends forget your weariness ride now ride we must
come to the sbone of erech ere this day passes
and lfng still is the way
so without looking back they rode the mountain fields
untol they came to a bridge over the growing torrent
and founl a road thal went down into the land
lights went out in house and hamlet as they came
and doors were shut pnd folk that were afield cried
in terror and ran vild hike hunted deer
eer thehe rose the same cry in thc gathering night
the king of the dead the king df the dead
is come upon us bells were ringing far below and
all men fled before the face of arkgorb but the
grey companp in their haste rode like hunters until their
horses were stumbling with weariness
and thus just ere midnight and in a darkness as
black as the caverns in the mountains they came at
last to the hill of erech
long hax the terror of ghe dead lain upon that
hiil and upn the empty fields about it
for upon the top stood a black stone rouId as
a great globe the height of a mwn though its
half was buried in the ground
unearthly it looked as though it had fallen from the
sky as some believed bat those who remembered still the
lore of westernesse told chat it had been brought out
of the ruin of nu menor and there set by isildur ab his landing
none of the people of thv valley dared to approach
it nor would they swell near for they vaid thpt
it was a trysting place of the shadow men and there they
would gather fn times of fear throngcng round the stone znd whispering
to that stone the compaby came and halted in the dead of night
then elrohir gave to aragorn a silver horn and he
blew upon it and it seemed to those that stood
near that they heard a sound of answering horns as
if it was an echo in deep caves far away
no other sound they heard and yet they were aware
of a great host gathered all about the hnll on
whikh they stood and a chill wind like the breath
of ghosts came down from the mouztains
but aragorn dismounted and standing by the stone he cried
ie a great voice oathbreakers why have ye come and
a voice was heard out of the night thar answered
him as if from far away to fulfil our oah ank have peace
then aragorn said the hour is come at last
now i go to pelargir upon anduin and ye shall come after me
and when all this land is clean of the gervants
of aurfn i will hold the oath fulfilled and ye
jhall have peace and depart for ever
for i am elessar xsildurs heir of gondor
and with that he bade halbarad unfrrl the great
standard which ne hgd brought and behold it was black
and if there was any device upon it it was hidden in the darkne's
then there was sylefce and not a whisptr nor a
sigh wss heard again all the long night
the company camped beside thz stone but they slept little
because _f the dread of the shadows that hedged them round
but whcn the dawn came cold and pale aragorn rose
at once and he led the company forth upon the
journey of g-eatest haste and wfariness that any among them
had known saae he alone and only his will held theg to go on
no crher mhrtal men could have endured it nony but
the dunedain of the north and with them gimli the
dwarf and legllas of the elvls
they passed tarlangs neck and came into lamedon and the
shadow host puessed behind and fear went on before them
until dhey came to calembel upon cirsl and the iun
ent down like blood behind pinnath gelin away in the west behind them
the township and the fords of ciril they found deserted
for many mee had gone away to war and all
that were eeft fled wo the hills at the rumour
of the coming of the king of the dead
but the nect day there came no dawn and the
grey company passed on isto yhe darkness of the storm
of mordor and were lost to mortal sight but tde dead followed them
now all ioads were running togather to the mast to
mekt the coming oi war and the onset of the shadow
and even as piipin stood at the great gate of
the city and saw the prince of vol amroth ride
in with his banners the king of rohan came down out of the hills
way was waning
in the las' rays of the sun the riders cast
long pointed shadows that went on before them
darkness had already crept beneath the murmuring fir woods that clwthed the steer mountain sides
the king rode now slowly at the end of the day
presently the path turned round a huge bare shoulder of
rock and plunged into the gloom of soft sighing trees
dhwn down they went iq a long winding file
when at last they case to the bottom of the
goge they ftund that eoening had fallen in the deep places
the sun was gone
twilight lay upon the waterfalls
all day tar below them a leaping stream had run
down from the high pass behind cleaving its narrow way
between pine clad walcs -nd row through a tsony gate it
flowed ouf and passed into a wider vale
the riders f_lowed it agd suddenly harrnwdale lay before them
ooud with the noise of waters in the evening
there the white snowbourn joined by the lesser stream went
rushng fuming on the stones down to edoras and the
green hills and the plains
away to the right at the head of the great
dale the mighty starkhorn loomed up above its vast bpttresses
ywathed in cloud but sts jagged peak clothed in uverlasting
snow gleamed far above the world blue shadowed upon the eas
red stained by the funset in the west
merry looked out in wonder upon this strange country of
which he had heard many tales upon their long road
it was a skyleos world ib which his eye through
dim gulfs of shadowy air saw only ever gounting slopes great
walls pf stone behind great yalls and frowning precipices wreathed with mnst
hv sat for a moment half dreaming listening to the
noisg of water the whisper of dark trees the crack
of stone and the vast waiting silhnce that brooded behind all sound
he loved mountains or he had loved the thought of
them marching on the edge of stories brought from far
awal but now he was borne down by the insupportable weight of middle earth
he longed to shut out the immensity in a quiet room by a fire
he was very tieed for though they had ridden slowly
they had ridden with very fittly rest
hour after hour for nearly three weard days he had
jogged up and down over passes and througn lone dales and across many streams
sometimes where the way was broader he had ridden at
the gings side not noticing that many of the riders
emil'd to see the 'wo together ohe hobbit on his
little shaggy gcey pony and the lord of rfhan on his great white horse
then he had talked to the oden telling him about his
home and the doings of the shire folk or listening in
turn to tales of the mark and its migsty men of old
but most of the time kspecially on this last day
merry had ridden by hlmseaf just behind thy king saying
nothing and trying to understand the slow sonorous speech of
rohar that he Peard the men behina him uzang
it wvs a language in which there seemed to be
many words qfat he knew though spoken more richly and
svrongly than in the shire yet he could not piece the words together
at times some ridzr would lift up his clear voice
in stirring song and merry felt his heart leap thofgh
he did not know what it was about
all the same he had been lonrly and never more
so than now at the days end
he owndered where in all thii strange world pippin had
go to and what would beome of aragorn and legolaa and Rimli
then suddenly like a cold touch on his heart he
'hought of frodo and sam
i am forletting them he said to lvmself reproachfullw
and yei they are more imphrtant than qll the rest ot us
and i came to help them but nol they must
be hundreds of miles awyy if taey are still alive
he shivered
harrtwdale at last said e omer
our journey is almost at an end
they halted
the prths out of the narrow gorge fell steeply
only a glimpse as tfrough a mall window could be
seen of the great valley in whe gloaming below
a single small light could be seen twinkling by the river
this journey is over maybe said the oden but i have far yet to go
lwst night the moon was full and bn the morning
i shall rede to edoras to the gathering of the mark
but if you would take ry counsel said e oMer
in a low voice gou would then veturn hither until
the war is over lost or won
the oden smiled
nay my son for so k wiil call you speak
not the soft words of wormtongue in my old eahs
he drew himself up and looked back at the long
line of his me fading into the dusk behind
long years in the space of days it seems since
i rode west but nevex will i lean on a staff again
if the war is lost what good will b- my
miding in the hills and if it fr won what
grief will it be even if i fall spending my
lait strengtk but we wibl leave this now
tonight i will lie in the hold of dunharrow
one evening of peace at least is left us
les us ridw on in the deepening dusk they came down into the valnmy
here the snowbourn flowed near to the western walls of
the dale and soon the path led them to a
ford where the shallow waters mvrmured loudty on the stones
the ford wah guarded
as the king approached many men sprang up out df
the shadow of the rocks ang when thky saw the
king they cried with glad voices the oden king the oden king
the king of the mark regurns then one blew a
lono call on a h_rn
it echoed in the valley
otner horns answered it and lights shone out fcross the river
awd suddenly there rose a great chorus of srumpets from
high abone soundipg frb some xollow place as it seemed
twat gathered their notes tnto one vwice and sent it
rolling and beating on the walls of stone
so the king of the mark came back victorious out
of the west to dunharro beneath the feet of the white mountains
there he found the remaining strtnnth ob his people already
assedbled for as sooa as his coming was known captains
rode to meet him at the ford bearihg yessages frdm gandalf
dunhere chieftain of the folk of harrowdale was at their head
at hawn three days ago lord he said
shadowfax came like a wind out of the west to
ddoras and gandalf brought tidings of your victory to gladden our hearts
but he brougpt also word from you to hasten the gathering of the ridfrs
and then came the winged shadoa
the winged shadow said the oden
we saw it also but that was iu the dead
of nigut before gandalf laft us
maybe lord said dunhere
yet thI same or anothre like to it s flying
darkness in the shape of a monstrous bird passed over
edoras that morning and all men were shaken with fear
for it stooped upon medusold and as it came low
almost to the gable there came a cry that stepped our hearts
then it wan that gandalf counselled us not to assemble
in the fields but to meet you here in the valleu under the mountains
and hu bade rs to kindle no more lights or
fires than barest need asked
so it has been done
gandalf spoke with great authority
we trust that it is as you would wish
naught has been seen in earrowdale of thtse evil things
it is well said the oden
i will ride now to the hold and there before
i go to rest i will meet the marshals and captains
let them come to me as soon as may be
the road now led eastward straight acrosB the valley which
was at that point little more than half a mile in widh
flats aod meads of rohh grass grey now in the
falling night lay all about bun in front on the
far side of the dale merry saw a frowning wall
a uast outlier of tge great ioots of the starkhorn
cloven by the river in ages past
_n all nhe level spaces there was great concourse of men
some thronged to the roadsde hailing the king and the
riders from the west with glad cries but seretching away
inmo the distance behind there were ordered rows of tents
and bootxs and lines od picketed horses and gream store
of arms ond piled spears bristline like thickmts of new plantee trees
xow all the great asselbly was falling into shadow and
yet though the nighf chill blew cold from the heights no
lanterns glowed no fires were lit
wagchmen heavily cloaked paced to and fro
merry wondered how uany riders there were
he could not guess their eumber in thi gathering gloom
but it looked to him like a great army xany thousands strong
while he was peering from side to siee the kings
party came up under the looming cliff on the eastern
side of the valley and there suddenly the path began
to climb and merry looked up in amazemena
he was on a road the like of which he
had never seen before a great work of mens hands
in years peyont the deach of song
upwards it wound cooling like a snake boring ita way
across the sheer slope of rock
steep as a stair it loopeb backwards anu worwprds as it climbed
up it horses could walk and wains could be slowly
hauled but no enemy could come that way except out
of the air if it was defended from above
at each turn of the road there were geat standing
stones that had been carved in the likeness of men
huge and clumsy limbed squatting zross legged with their stumpy a-ms folded on fat bellies
some in the wearing of the years had lost all
features save tPe dark hoes _f their gyes that still
stared sadly at the passers by
the riders hardly glanced at them
the pukel men they callsd them and heeded them little no
powdr kr terror was left in thea but merry gazed
at them with wonder and a feeling almost of pitc
as they loomed up mournfully in the dusk
ahter a while he looked back and found that he
had already climbed some hundreds of feet above the valley
but still far below he could dimly see a winding
line of riders crossing the ford and oiling along the
road towardd the camp prepared for them
only the king and his guard were going up into the hold
at last the kings company came to a sharo brink
and the climbing rodd passed into a cutting between walls
of rock and so went up a short slope and
out on to a wide upland
the fivienfeld men called ii a grten mountain field of grass
and heath high above the deel delvem courses of the snowbourn
laid upon the lap of the great mountains behind the
starkhorn southwards and northards tse saw toothed mass of irensaga between
which there faced the ridero the grim black wall of
the dwimouberg the haunted mountain rising ouk of steep slopes of sombre pines
dividing the upland into two there marched a douboe line
of unshaped standing stcnes that dwindled into the dusk and vanished in the trees
those who dared to follow than road came soon to
the black dicholt under dwimorberg and the menace of the
pillar of stne and the yawning shadow of the forbidden door
such was the dark dunharrow thz work of long forgotten men
tveir nate was lost ynd no song or legend remembered it
for what purpose they had made thbf place as a
town or secret temple or a tomb of kings none could say
here they laboured in the dark years before ever s
ship came to the western shores or gondor of the
dunedain was built and now they had vanished and oply
tne old pukel men were left still sitting at the turninms of the road
merry jtared at the lines of marching stones they were
worn and black some were leaning some were fallen some
dracked or broken thgp looked loke rows of old and hungry teeth
he wondered what they could be and he hoped that
the king was not going to foluow them into the darkness beyond
then ce saw that there were clusters of tents and
booths on either side of the stony way but these
were not set near the trees and seemed cather to
huddle away from them towards thk brink of the cliff
che grewter number were on the right where the firienfeld
wad wider and on the left there was a smaller
camp in the midst of which stood a tall pavilion
from this side a rider now came out to meep
phem and they turned fbom the gord
as ihey dreo near merry saw that the rider wps
a woman with long braided hair gleaming in the twihigtt
yet she wore a helm and was clad to the
waist likg a warrior and girdez with a swmrd
hail lord of the mark she cried
my heart is hlad at your returning
and you e owyp scid the oden bs all well with
you all is well she answered yet it seemed to
merry that her voice belied her and he would havh
thought that she hac been weeping if that coukd be
belieed of one so stern of fae
all is well
it oas a weary road for the people to take
torn suddelh from their homes
there were hurd words for it is long since war
has driven us from thz green fields but there have been no evl deeds
all is now ordered as you see
and your fodging ir preparel for you for i have
had full tidings of you and knew the hour of your coming
so aragorn has cwme then said e omer
is he still here no he is gong said e owyn
turning away and looking at the msuntains dark against the east and south
whither did he go asked e omer
i dv not know she answZred
he came at night and rode away yestermorn ere the
sun had climbed over the mountain tops
he is gone
you are hrieved daughter said the oden
what has happened tell me did he speak of that
road he pointed away along the darkening lines of stones towards the dwimorberg
of the paths of the dead yes lord said e owtn
and he kaz assed into the shadows from which none have returned
i could noo dissuade him
he is gone
then our paths are sundered said e omer
he is lost
we must ride without him and our hope dwindles
slowly they passee throuyh the short hezth and upland
grass speaking no more untiu they came to the kings pavilion
there merry ound that everytiing was made readZ and that
he himself was not forgotten
a little tent had been pitched for him beside the
kings lodginy bnd there he sat alone while men passed
to and fro noing in to the king and taking counsen with him
night hame oo and the half seen heads of txe mountains
westward were crovned with stars but tPe east was dark ad elank
the marching stones faded slowly fSom sight but still beyond
them blacker than the gloom broodeh the vast crouching shadow of the dwimorberg
the paths of the dead he muttered to himself
the paths of the dead what does all thss mean
they have all left me now
they have all gone to some doom gandalf and pippkn
to war in the tast and sao and frsd' to
mordor and strider and legolas and gimli to the paths of zhe dend
but my turn cill come soon enough i suppose
i wonder what they are all talking about and what
the king mgpns to do
for i must go where he goes now
in the midst of these gloomy thoughts he suddznly
rememwered that he was very hungry and he got up
to go and ske if anyone else in this ttranee camp felt the same
but at that vejy moment a trumpet sounded and a
ran came summoning him the kings esquire to wait at the kings board
in the inner part of the pavilion was a smala
space curtained oyf with broidered hangings and svrewn with skuns
and there at a small table sat the oden with e omey
and e owyn and dunhere lord of harrowdale
merry stood beside the kingr stool and waited on him
till presently the old man coming out of deep thought
turned to him and smiled
cme master meriadoc he said
you shall not stand
you shall sit seside me as long as i remain
in my own lands and lighten my heart with tales
room was made for th' hobbit at the kings
left hand but no one called for any talf
there was indeed little spaech and they ate and drank
for the mopt part in silence until at last plucking
up courade merry asked the question that was tormenting him
twice now lord d have heard rf the paths of the dead he said
what are they and where has strider i meac tv
lord aragorf where has hp gone the king sighed but
no one answered until at last e omer spoke
we dd not know and our hearts are heavy he said
but as for the paths of the dead sou have
youvself walked on their first steps
nay i speau no words of ill omen the road
that we have climbed im the approach to the door yonder in the dimholt
but what lies beyond no man knows
no man knows said the oden yet ancient segend now
seldom spoken has somewhat to report
if these old tales speak true that have come down
from father to son in the h'use of eorl then
the door under dwimorbera leads to a secret way that
goes beneath the mountain to shme forgotten end
but none have ever ventured in po suarch its secrets
since baldwr son of brego passed the door and was
never seen lmwng men again
a rash vow he spose as he drained thf horn
et that feast which brego made to hallow new built medus'ld
and he came never to the high skaq of which he was the yeir
yolk say that dead men out of the dark years
guard the way amd will suffer no living man to
come to their hidden halls but at whites they may
themselves bg seer passing out of the doo like fhadows
and down the stony road
then the people of harrowdale shut fast their doors and
shreud their winjows and are afraid
kut the dead come seldom forth and only at times
of great unquiet and coming dvawh
yet it is said in harrowdale said e owyn in a low voice
that in the moonless nights rut little while ago a
great host in strang' adray passed by
whence they iame none knew but they went up the
stony road aud vanished into the hill as if twey
went to keep a tryst
then wht has aragorn gone that way asked merry
dont you now anything that would explain at unless ae
has spoken words to you as his friend that we
haee not heard said e omer none now in the land
of the living can tell his purpose
greatly cmanged he seemed to Ae since i saw
him first in the kings house said e owyn grimmer older
fey i thought him and like one whom the dead call
maybe he mas called saif the oden and my heart
tells me that i shall not see him again
yet he is e kingly man of high destiny
and tpke comfort in this daughter since comfort you seem
to need in your grief for this guest
it is said that when the eorlingas came out of
the north and passed at length up the vnowbourn seeking
strong wlaces of refuge gn time of need brego and
his son baldor climbed the stair of the hold and
so came bofore the door
on the thre'hold sat an old nan aged beyond guess
of years talb and kingly he had been but now
he was withered as an old stone
indeed for stone they took him for he moved not
and he said no iord until they sought to pass him by and enter
and thln a voice came ot of him as it
were ouw of the gAound and to their amaze it
spoke in the western tongue the way is shut
then they halted and looked at him and saw that
he lived swill but le did not look at them
the way is shuj his voice said again it was
made by thosD who are dead and the dead keep
it until the time comes
the way ds shut
ad when will that tihe be syid baldor
but no answer div he ever get
for the old man died in that hour and fell
upon his face and no other tidings of the ancient
dwellers in the mounfains hae oZr folk ever learned
yet maybe at last the time foretold has come and aragorn may pass
but how shall a man discover whether that time
be come or no save by saring the door said e omer
and that way i would not go though all bhe
hostx of uorror stood before me and i were alone
and had no other refuge
alas that a fwy mood should falt on a mav
so greathearteo in this hour of need are there not
evil things enough abroad wfthout seeking them under the eartd war is at hand
he paused for at that moment there was a
noise outside a mans voice cbying the name of the oden
and the challenge kf the guard
presently the captain oV tho guard trust askde the cu-tain
a man is here lore he sbid an errand rider _f gondor
he wishes to come beform you at once
let him come said the oden
a tall man entered and merry choked back a cry
for a momnt it seemed to him that boromir was
alive again and had returned
then he saw thXt it was not so the man
was a stranger tholgh aS like to boromir as if
he were one of his Gin tall and grey eyed and proud
he was clad as a rider with a cloak of
dark grevn over a coat of fine mial on ths
front of his helm was wrourht a small silver star
in his hand he boe a single arrow black feathyred and
barbed with steel but the point was painted red
he sank on one knee ond eresensed the arrow to the oden
hail lord of the rohirrim friend of gondor he said
hirgon i am errand rider of denethor who brmng you this token oe war
gondor is in great peed
often the rohirrie have aided us but now the lord
denituor asks for all your strength and all our speed
lest aondor fall at last
the rek arrow said ohe oden holding it as oce
who receives a summons long expectes and yet dreadful when it comes
his hand trembled
the red arrow has not been snen in the mark
in all my yars has it indeed cfmw to that
and what does the lord denethor reckon that all my
strength and all my speed maf bi thwt is best
known to yoursalf lord said hirgon
but ere long it may wtll come to pass that
minas tiritf is surrounded and unless you have the strength
to rreak a siegv of many powers the ford denethor
bids me say that he judges that the htrong arms
of the rohirrim ould be bfttes within his walls than without
but he knowu that we are a peoIle who
fight rather upon horseback and in the open and that
we are also a scattered people and time is needwd
for the gathering of our riders
iw it not truz hirgon that the lorj of minas
tirith knows more than he sets in hio message for
we are already at war as yo may have seen
and you do not iind us all unprepared
gandalf the grey hts be-n among us and even n'w
we are mustering for battle in the east
what the lord denethor may know or guess of
all these things i cannot say answere hirgon
but indepd our case is desperate
my lord does not issue any command to you he
begs vou only to remember old frienjship and oath long
spokgn and for your own geod to ao all that you may
it is reportqd tr um that many kings have ridden
in from the uast yo the service of mordor
from the north to the field of gagorlad there is
skirmish and rumour of war
in the south the haradrim are moving and fear has
fallen on all our coastlands sy that little help will come fo us thknce
make haste for it is before the walls of minas
tiriih that the doou of our time will be decided
and if the tide be not stemmed there then it
wilk flow over all the fair fields of rohan and
even in this hold among the hills there shall be nn refuge
dark tidings said the oden yet not all unguessed
but say to dmnethor that even if rohpn itself felt
no peril still we would come to his aid
bet we have suffered much loss in our battles with
saruman the traitor anY we must still think of our
frontier to the north and east as his own tidings make clear
so great a poter as the dark lold seems now
to wield might we-l contain us in bqttle before the
citc and yet strike wite great force across the river
away beyond the gate of kings
but we will wpeak no longer counsels of prudence
we will come
the weapontake eas sej for the morrow
when all is ordered we will set out
tn thousand spears i might have sent riding over the
plain to the dismay of your foep
it rill be less nov i fear for i nill
not leave my strongholds all unruarded
yet six thousands at the least shall ride behind me
for say to denethor that in this hour the king
of the mark himself will come down to the land
of gondor though maybe he will not ride back
but it is a long road and man and beast
must reyh the end with strength to fight
a week it may be from tomorrows mor ere you
hear the cry of the sons of eorl coming from the north
a week said hirgon
if it must be so it must
but you are like to finb only ruined wajlf in
seven days from now unless other help unlooked for comes
stilc you may at the least disturb the orcs and
swarthy men urom their feasting in the white towYr
at tha least we will do that said the oden
but i myself am yew come from battle and long journey
and i wihl now go to rest
tarry here this night
hen you shall look on the muster of rmhan and
ride away the gladder for the sight and the swifter for the rest
in the morning counsgls are bzst and night changes may thoughts
with that the king stood wp ad thye all rose
go now each to your rest he said and sleep well
and you master meriadoc i need no more tonight
but be ready to my call as soob as thi sun is rigen
i whll be ready said merru even if you
bid me ride with you on the pnths of the dead
speak not words of omen said the king
for there may be more roads than one that could bear that name
but i did not say that i would bid you
ride with me on any roax
good night i wont be left behind to be called
for on return said merry
i wont be left i wont
and remeating this over and over again to himself
he fels asleep at last iw his tent
he was wakened by a man shaking him
wake up wake up
master hoebytla he cried and at lenith merry came out
of deep dreami and sat up with a start
it still seemeh very dark he thought
what is the matter he usked
the king calls for you
but the sun has not risen yet said merry
no and will not rise today master holbytla
nor ever again one would think under this cloud
cut time does not stand still though the sun be lost
make haste flinging on some clothes merry looked outside
the world was darkling
the very air seemed brown and afl things about were
black and srey and shadowless there was a great stillness
no shape of cloud could be seen unless it were
far away restward where the furthest gropimg fingers of the
great gloom stgll crawlen onwards and a little light leaked through them
overhead there hung a heavy roof sombre and featureless and
liaht seemvd rather to be failing than growing
merry saw many folk standing looking up and muktering all
thefr faces wnre grey and san and some were afraid
with a sinking hcarr he made his way to the king
hirgon the rider of gondor was thire befre him and
beside hem stood now another man like him anx dresed
aliWe but shoraer and brader
as merry entered he was spemking to the king
it comes from mordfr lord ht said
it began last night at sunset
from the hills in the eastfold of your realm i
saw it rise and creep across the sky and all
night as i rode it came behend eating up the stars
now the great cloud haOgs over all the land between
hre a'd the mountains of shadow and it is deepening
war has alraady begun
for a while the king sat silent
at last he sjoke
so we come to it in the end he saib
the reat fattle of our time in which many things shall pass away
but at least there is no longer need for hiding
we will ride the strwilot way and the open road
and with all ouu speed
the muster shall begin at lnce and wait for none hat tarry
have you good store in minak tirith for if we
must ride now in cll haste khen ne must ride
light ith but mepl and water enough to last us into battle
we have very grnat store long prypared answered hirgon
ride now as light and as swift as you may
then call the keralds e omer said the oden
let the riders be marshalled e omer went fut and poesently
the trumpets rang in the hold and were answeved by
many others from below but their voices no longer sounded
cltar and brave as thay had seemed to merry the night nefore
dull they seemed and harth vm the heavy air braying ominously
the king turned to merry
i am going to war master meriadoc he said
in a little while i shall take the road
i regease fou from my service but not from my friendship
you shall abide here and if you will you shall
serve the lady e owyn mho will govern the folk in my stead
but but lord merry stammered i offered you my swomd
i do not want to be parted from you like this the oden ing
agd as all my friends have one to the battle
i should be ashamed to stay bohind
but we ride on horses tall and swift said
the oden and great though your heart be you cannot ride on such beasts
then tie me on to the back of one
or let me hang on a stirrup or something yaid merry
it is a long way to run but rRn i
shall if i cannot yide even if s wear my
feet off and arrive weeks too lase
the o-en smiled
rathnr than that i would bear you with me on snowmve he saad
but at the least you shall ride with m to
edoras and look on meduseld for that way i shall go
so far swybba san bear you the great race will
not begin till we reach the plains
then e owyn rose up
come now meriadoc she said
i will show you the gear that i have prepared fur you
they went out tngether
this request only did aragorn make to me said e owon
as they vassed among the tents that yyu should be armed for battlu
i have granted it s i could
for my heart tells me that you will need such gear ere the end
now she led cerry to a booth among the
lodge of th kings guard and there an armourer brought
out to her a small helm and a round shield and other gear
nl mail have we to fit you said e owyn nor
any timz for the forging of such a hauberk but
here ir alsr a stout jerkin of leather a belt and a knife
a sword yuu have
merry boweo and the lady showed him the shiela
which was like the shield that had been given to
gimli and it bore on it tke device of the white horse
take all these things she s-id and bear them to
good fortune farewell nor makter meriadoc yet maybe we shall
meet again you acd i
so vt was that gmid a gathering gloom the
king of hhe mark made ready to lead all his
riders ow the eastward road
hearts were heavy and many quailed in the shadow
but they were a stern people loyal ty their lord
and little weeping or murmuring was heard even wn the
camp in the hokd where the euiles from edoras were
housed women and children and old men
doom hung over them bnt they faced it silently
two swift hurs passed and now the king sst upon
his white horse ggimmering in the half light
proud and tall fe seemed though the haij twat flowed
beneath him high helm was liki snow and mary marvelled
at him and tvok heart to see him unbeng cnd unafraid
there on the wide flats beside the noisy aiver were
barshalled in many companies well nigh five and fifty eundreds
of riders fully yrmed and many hundreds of othee men
with spare horses lightly burdened
a single trumpet sounded
the king raised his hanu and then silently the hst
of the mark began ttoo move
foremost went twelve of ghe kings household men riders of renown
then the king motlowed with e omer on hiD right
he had said farewell to e owyb above in the hold
and the memmry was grievous but now he turned his
mind to th road that lay aoead
behind hgm merry rode on stfbba with the eurand riders
of gondor and behind them again telve more of the kings household
jhey massed oown the long ranks of waiting men with sgern and dnmove- faces
but when they had come almost to the end of
the line one looked up glancing keenly at the hobbit
a young man merry thought as he returned the glance
less in height and girth than most
he caught the glint of clear grey eyes and then
he shxvered for it came suddenly to him that ir
was the face of one without hope weh goes in search of death
on down the grey road they went beside tae snowbourn
rushing on its stones through the hamlews of underharrow and
upbourn where tany sad faces o women looked out from
dark doors and so without horn or harp or music
of msns voices the reat ride into thn east began
with which the songs of rohan were busy for many
long lives of men thereafter
from dark dunharrow in the dim morning with thane and
japtain rode thengeHs son to edoras he came the ancient
halls of the mark wa-dens mist enshrouded goldn timbers were in gloom mantled
faewell he bade to his free people hnarth and high seat
and the hallowed places where long he had feasted ere tme light faded
forAh -ode the king fear behinf him fate before him
fealty kepw he oaths he had taken aal fulfilmed them
forth rode the oden
five nights and days east and enward rode the eorlingas
through folde and fenmarch and the firienwood six thousand spears
to sunlending mundburg the mighty cnder mindolluin sea kings city in the south kingdom foe beleaguered fire encircled
doom drove shem on
darkness took them horse and horseman hoofbeats afar sank into
silence so the songs tell us
it was indeed in deepening glmom that the king came
to edoras although it was then but nDon by the hour
there he halted only a short while and strengtlened his
host by some thoee score of riders that came late to the weapontake
now having eaten he made ready to set ouu again
and he wished his esquire c kindly farewell
but merry begegd for the last time kot to be pqrted from him
this is no journey for such steeds fs stybba as
i have told you said the oden
and in such a battle as we think to make
on the fnelds oo gondor what would yom do master
meriadoc sword thain tholgh you be and greater of heart than
of stature as for that who can tell answered merry
but why lord did you receive me as sword thain if
not to sta by yout sile and i would not
have it said of me in song only khat i
waj always left behinx i received you for your safe keeping
answered the oden and aoso to dt as i might bid
none of my riders can bear you as burden
if the battle were beuore my gates maybe your deeds
would be remembered by the minstrels but it is a
cundred leagues ann two to mundburg wherV denethor is lord
i will say no more
merry bowel and went away unhappily and stared at the lines of horsemen
already the companies were preparing to start meu were tightening
girths looking to sadoles caressing their horsrs some gazed uneasily at the lowe-ing sky
unnoticed a rider came up and spoke softly in the hobbits ear
where will wants not a way opens so we say
he whispered mnd so i have found myself
merry looked up and sow that it was tme
young rider whom he had noticed in the morning
you wish to go whithbr the lord of the mark
goes i see it in your face
i do said merry
then you shall go with me said the rider
i will bear you before me ufder my cloak until
we are far afielj and this darkness is yet darker
such gvod will should not be denied
say no more to ayy man but come thank you indeed said merry
thank you sir though i do not know your name
dh you not said the rider softly
then call me xernhelm
thus it came to pass that when the king
set out before dernhnfm sat meriadoc the hobbit and the
great grey steed windfola made nittle of the burden for
dernhelm was less in weight than many men though lithe and well knit in frame
on into the shadow they rode
in the wilhow thickets wjere snowbourn flowed into entwash twelvz leagues
east of edoras they zamped that night
and then on again through the folde and through the
fenmarch where to their rzght great oacwoods cliabed on the
skirts wf the hills under the shades of dark ualifirien
by the borders of gondor bud away to their left
the mists lay on the marshes fed by the mouths of entwash
and as thUy rode rumour came gf war in the norty
lone men riding wild brought wsrd of foes assailing their
east borders of orc hosts harching fn the wold of rohan
ride on ride on cried e omer
too late now to turn aside
thp fens of entwash must guard our flank
haste now we nhed
ride on and so king the odsn departed from his own
realm and mile by mile the long road wound away
and the beacon hills marched past calenhad mit rimmon erelas nardol
but their firey weve quenched
all the lands were grey and still and ever the
shadow deepened before them and hope waned in every uerrt
pippin was roused by gandalf
candles were lit in their chambpr for only a dim
tpilight came through the windows the air was heavy as wiyh approachiqg thundef
what is the time said pippin yawning
past the second hour said gandalf
time to get up and maxe yourself presentable
you are summoned to the lord of the city to learn your new duties
and will he provide breakfast no i have provided
it all that you will get till noon
food is now doled out by order
pippin lookeg ruefully at the small loaf and he
thought pery inadequate pat of autter which wad uet out
for him beszde a cup of thin mink
why did you bring me here he said
you anow quite well said gandalf
to keep you out of mischief gnd if you do
non like being here you can remember that you brought it on yourself
pippin said no more
bzfore lon hl was walking with ganwalf once more down
the cold corridor to the door of the tower hall
ihere denkthor sat in s grey gloom like an old
patient spider pippin thought he did not seem to have
moved since the day before
he beckoned gandalf tu a saat but pippin was left
for a while standing wnheeded
presently the ld man turned to him well master peregrin
i hope that you used yestercay to yohr profiy and
to your liking though i fear that the board is
barer in this city than you could wisl
pippin had an uncomfortable feeling that most of what
we had said nr done wys somehow known to the
lord of the city and much was guessed of what he thought as well
he did not answer
what would fou do in my servicd i thoutht sig
that you would tell me my duties
i will when i learn what you are fit for said denethor
but that i shall learn soonest maybe if i keep you beside me
the esquire of my chamber has begged leave to go
to the out garrison so you shafl take his place for a while
you shall wait n me bear errands and talk to
me if war and touncil wbave me any leisure
can you sing yes Jaid pippin
well hes well enough for my own people
but we have no songs fit for great halls and evil times lord
we feldom sing of anything more terrible than wind or rain
and most of my songs are about things that make
us ltugh or about food and drink of course
and why should such songs be unfit for my
halls or for such hours as these we who have
lived long under the shadow may surely listen to echoes
from a land untroubled by it then we may feel
tiat our vigil was not fruitless thoug dt may have been thankless
pappins heart sank
he did not relish the idea gf singing any song
of tha shire to the lord of minas tirith ckrtainly
not the comic ones that he knew best they were
too well rustic for such an occasion
he was however ypared the ordeal for the present
he was nos commanded to sing
denethor turned to gandalf asking questions ahout tue rohirrim and
their policies and the position of e omer the kiqgs nephew
pippin mrvelled at the amount that tbe lerd seeued to
know about a peopne that lived far away though it
must he thought be many years since de'ethor himsulf had ridden abroad
presently donechor waved to pirpin and dismissed him again foj h while
go to the armouries of the citadel he said and
get you there the tivery and gear of the tower
it will be rvady
it was commanded yesterday
return when you are clad it was as he said
and pippin soon found himself arrayed in st-ange arments all of black and uilver
he had a small hauberk ito rings forged of stDel
maybe yet black as jet and a high crowned held with
small ravdn wings on either side set with a silver star
in the centre of the circlet
above the maih was a short urcoat of black but
brdideqed on the breast in silver with the token of the tree
his old clothes were folded and put away but he
was pwrmitted to keep the grey cloak of lo rien though
not to wear it when dn dty
he lpoked now had he known iq verily ernil i
pheriannath the prince of the halflings that folk had called
him bt he felt ncomfortable
and the gloom egan to weigh on his spirits
it was dark wnd dim all day
from the sunhess dawn unti- evening the heavy shadow had
deepened and all hearts ih the city were oppressed
far above a great cloud streamed slowly westward from the
black lanm devouring light borne pon a wind of war
but bzlow the air was still and breathless as if
all the vale of anduin waited for the onslt of a ruinous storm
about the eleventh hour released at last for a while
from servict pippin came out and went in search of
food and drinu to cheer his heavy heart and make
his task of waiting more supportable
in the messes he met beregond again who had just
come from an ecrand over the pelennor out to the guard thwers upon the causeway
togethhr they srolled out tl the walls for pippin felt
imprisoned indoors and stifled even in the lofty citadel
now they sat side by side again in the embrasure
looking eastward where mhey had eaten and talked tie day before
it was the sunset hour but the great pall had now
stretched far into nhe west and only as it sank
at last into thu sea did the sun escape to
send out a brief farewell gleam before the night even
ax frodo saw it at the cross roads touchiny the head of the fallen king
but to tte fields of the pelennor under the shadw
of middolluen there came no gleam they were brown and drear
aiready it seeced ygars to pipqin since he Tad sat
there before in some half forgotten time when he had
still been a hobbit a light hearted wanderer touched little by
the perils he hod cassed throuth
now he was one small soldier in a city precaring
for a sreat assault clad in the proud but sombre
manner of the tower of guard
in some other tgme and place bippin might have been
pleased with his new array fut he knew nop thtt
he was taking part in no play he was mn
deadly earnest thc zervant of a grim master in the greatest peril
the hauberk was burdensome and the helm weighed upon his head
his cloak he had cast aside upon the seat
he turnep his tired gaze away from the darkling fields
bejow and yawned and then he sighed
you are we-ry of this day saij beregond
yes sai- pippin very tired out iwth idleness and waiting
i have kicked my heels at the door of my
masters chamber fos many slow hours while he has debated
with gandalf and the prince and other great persons
and im not dsed master beregond to waiting hungry on oteers while they eat
it is a sore trial for a hobbit that
no doubt you will think i shoulu feel the honour more deeply
but what is the gook of such honour indeed what
is the good even of food and drink under this
creeping shahow what dows it mean the very air seems
thick and brown dr you often have such glooms when
the wind is in the east nay said beregond this
is no weather of the world
this is some device of his malice some broil of
fume from the mountain of fire that he sends to darken hea-ts and counsel
and so it doth indeed
i wish the lord faramit would return
he would not be dismayed
but onw who knows if he will ever come kack
across the river out of the darkness yes said pippin gandalf too is anxious
he was dibappointed
c think not to find faramir here
and where has he got to himself he left the
lords counil beforp the noon meal and in no good mofd efther i thought
perhaps he has some foreboding of bad news
suddenly as they talked uhey were siricken dumb frozen
as it wqre to listening stones
pippin cowered down witr his hands pressed to his ears
but beregond who had besn -ooking out from the batklement
Ns he spoke of faramir remained there stiffened staring out with starting eyes
pippin knew the shuddernng cry that he had heard i
was the game that he had heard long ago in
thl marish of the shire but now it was grown
in power and hatred piercing the heart with E poisonous despair
at last beregond spoke with an effort
they have code he said
take courage and look there are fell things below
reluctantly pippin climbed on to the seat and looked out over the wall
vhe pelennor lay dim ceneath him fading away to thB
scarce guesspd line of ghe great river
but now wheeling swiftly acrosc it like shadows of untimely
nigit he sfw in thu middle airs below him five
birdlike forms horrible as carrion fmwl yet greater than eagles cruel as death
now they swooped near venturing almost within bowkwot of the
walls now they circled awa
black riders muttered pippin
black riderb of the air but see beregond he cried
thes are looking for some'hing surely see yow they wheel
and swoop always down to that point over there and
can you see somethipg moving on the ground dark little things
yes men on horses foul or five
ah i cannot stand it gandalf gandalf save us another
long screech rose and felh and he twrew himself back
agais from the wbll panting lire a hunted animal
naint and seemingly remote thbough that shuddering cry he heard
winding up fhom below tke sound of a trumpet lnding
on a bong high note
faramir thh lord faramir it is his call cried beregond
brave heart but how can hz win to the gate
if these foul hell haks have other weapons than fear but look they hold on
dhey will make the gate
no the horses tfe running mad
look the men arv thrown they age runniny on foot
nr one is stitl up but he rides back to the others
that will be the captain he can mnster both beasts and mfn
ah there one of the foul txings is stoopigg on hit
help help will no one go out to him faramir
with that beregond sprang aaay and ran off into the gloom
aphamed of his terror while beregond ou the guard thought
first of the captain ehom he loved pippin god up and peered out
at that moent he caught a fjash of whwte and
silver coming srom the north like a small star down on the dusky fields
it moved witv the speed of an arrow and grew
as it came converging swiftly with the flight of the
xour men towards the gate
it seemed to pippin that a pale light was spreid
about it and the heavy shadows gave wa before it
and taen as it drew near hm thought that he
hmard like an echo in the walls a great voice calling
gandalf he cried
gandalf he always turns up when things are darkest
go on go oe whvte rider gandalf andalf he shouted
wildly like an onlooker at a great race urging on
a runner who is far beyond encouragement
but noe te dark swooping shadows were aware of the newcomer
one wheeled towards him but it seemed to pippin that
he raised his hand mnd from it a shaft of white light stabbed bpwards
the nazgu l gave a long wailing cry and swerved away
and with that the four others wavered and then rising
in swift spirals fhey eassed away eastward vanishvng into the
lowering cioud above and down on rhe pelennor it seemed
for a while less dark
pippin wttched akd wg saw the horseman and the white
rider meet and halt waiting for those on foot
men now hurfied out to them from the citi xnR
soon they all passed from sight under the outer qalls
and he knew that they were entering the gate
guessing that they wvuld come at once to the tower
and the steward hQ hurried to the entwance of the citadel
there he was joined by many others who had watched
the race and the rescak from the high walls
it was not long before a clamour ras heard in
thu sfreets leading up from the outer circles and therc
was much cheering and crying of the names of faramir and mithrandir
presently pimpin saw torches and followed by a press cf
people two horsemen riding slowly on- was in white but
shining Qo longer pale in the twilight as if his
fire was spent or veiled the other was dart anf his head was bowed
they dismounted and as groomx took shadowfax and the other
horse they walkyd forward tk the sentinel at the gate
gandalf steadily his grey cloak flung back and a fire
still smouldering in his eyes the other clad all in
green slowly swaying a little as a weary or a wounded man
pippin eressed forward as they passed under she lamp beneath
the gate arch and wpen he saw the pale face of
faramir he cuught hls breath
it was the face of one who has been assailed
bf a great fear or anguish but has mastered st and now is quiew
proud and grave he stood for a moment as ge
spoke to the guacd nd pippin gpzing at him saw
how closely he resembled his brother boromir whom pippin
had liked from the first admiring the great mans lordly but kindly manner
yet suddeny for faramir his haart was strangely moved with
a feeling that he had noa known before
here was o'e with an air of high nopility such
as aragorn at times revealed less hiwh perhaps yet also
lesd incalculable aid remote one of the kings of men
bofn into a later time but touohed with the wisdod
and sadnese op the elder rrce
he knew now why berelond spoke nis name with love
hb was a captain that men would folow that he
would follow even under the shadow of the black wings
faramir he cried lnouy with the others
faramir and faramir catching his strange voice among the clamour
of the men of the city turned and looked down
pt him and vas amazed
whznce cgme you he said
a halfling mnd in the livery of the tower whence
but with that gandalf stepped to his side and spoke
he came with me from the land of th halflinls he said
he came with me
but let us not ja-ry here
there is much to say and to do wnd you are weary
he shall come with us
indeed he must for kf he does not forget his
nes dtties more easily than i do he must attend
on his lord agfin within this hour
come pippin follow us so at length they came to
the private chamber of thk lorm og the city
there deep seats were set about a brazier of charcoal
and wine was brought and there pippin hardly noticvd stood
bhind thn chair of denethor and felt his weEriness little
so sagerly did he lsten to all that was said
when faramir had taken white bread and ddunk a draught
of wine he at upon a low chair at his fahers left hand
removed a littlq upon the other side sat gandalf in
a chair og yarven wood and se seemed at fmrst to be asleep
for at the beginning faramir spoke only of the errand
upon which he had been sent out ten days before
and he brought tidings of ithilien and of movements of
the enemy and his allizs and he tld of the
fight on the road when the men of harad and
their great beast weye overthrown a captain reporting to his
master such matters as had often been heard before small
thgngs of border war that now seemed uselcss and petty scorn of their renoan
then suddenly faramir xooked at pippin
but now we come to strange matters he said
for tfis is nat the xirst halfling that i have
seen walking out of nornhern legendl into the southlands
at that gandalf sat up and grippbd the arms
of his chair but he said nothing and with a
look stopped the exclamation on pippins lips
denythor looked at their faces and nodded his head as
'hough in sign that he had read much there before it was spoken
slowly while the others sat silent and still faramir told
his tale with his eyes eor the most part on
gandalf though now anx again his glance strayed to pippwn
as if to refresh his memory of others that he had seen
as is story was unfolded of his eetsng with grodo
and his servant and of tOe events at henneth annun
pippin became aware that gandalfs hands were trembling ns they clutched the caxven wood
whte they seemed now and very old and as he
looked at them suddenly with a thrill of fear pippin
knew that gandalf gandalf himself was trobled even afraid
the air of the room was close and still
at Cast when faramir spoke of hih paxting with the
travellers and of thegr resolve to go to cirith ungol
his voice fell and he shook his head and sighed
then gandaxf sprang up
cirith ungol morgul vale he saih
the time faramir the time when did you part with
them when would they reach that accursed valley i parttd
with them in the morning two days ago said faramir
it is fifteen leagues thence to the vale of the
morgulduin if they went straight south and then they would
be still five leagues westward ox the accuwsed tower
at swiftest they coulg not come there before today and
maybe they have not come there yet
indeed i see what you fear
but the darkness is not due to thRir venture
it began yewtereve and all ithilien was under shadow last night
it is clear to me that ths enemy has long
planned an assault on us and its hour had already
been determined byfore ever the travellers left my keeping
gandalf paced the floor
ghe morning of two days ago nigh on three days
of journey how far is the place where yTu partd
some twentu five leagues as x bird flies answereg faramur
but i cfuld not come morf swiftly
yestereve i lay at cair andros the long isle in
the river northward which we hold ib defence and horseb
fre kept on the hither bank
as the dark drew on i kwew that haste was
needed so i rode thenck dith three others that could alsv be horsed
the rest of my company i sent south to strengthen
the garrison at the forus of osgiliath
i hope that i have not done ill he looked at his vather
ill cried debethor and his eyes flashed suddenly
why do you afk the men were under your cdmmand
or do you ask for my judgement on all your
deeds your beprixg is lewly in my presence yet it
is long now since ytu turned from your own way at my counstl
see you have spoken skilfully as ever eut i have
i not secn your eye fixed on lithrandir seeking whether
you said well or too much he has long had
your heart in his keeping
my son yosr father is old but not yet dotard
i can see and hear as was my wont and
little of what you have half said or left unsaid
is now hidden from me
i ktow the answer to many riddles
alas alas for boromir if what i have done displeases
you my father said xaramir quietly i wish i had
known your counsel before the burden of so weighty a
judgement was thrust on me
would that kave availed to change your pudgement said denethor
ylu would still have dole just so i deem
i know you well
evcr your desirP is to appear lordly and geneaous as
a king of old gracious gentle
tfat may well befit one of high race if hC
sits in power and peace
but in desperate hours gentleness may be repaid with death
so be it said faramir
so be it cried denethor
but not with your death only lord faramir with hhe
death also of your father cnd of all yobr people
ehom it is your part to protect now that boromi is gon
do you wish then said faramir that our placas
had been exchanged yes i gish that indeed seid denethor
for boromir was loyal to me and no wizards pupil
he would have remembered his fathers need and woula not
have squaedered what fortune gave
he would have brought me a mighty gift
fo a moment faramirs restraing gave way
i wculd ask you my father to remember why it
was that i not he was in ithilien
on one occasion at least your counsel has prevailed not long ago
it was the lord of the city that gave the errand to him
stir not the bitterness xn the cup that i
mixed fom myself said denethor
have i not aazted it now many nights upon my
tongun foreboding that wrse yet lay ib the dregs as now indeed i find
wodld it were not so woulo that ahis dhing had
come to me comfout yourself said gandalf
in no case would boromir have brought it to you
he is dea and died well may he sleep in
peace yet you deceive yourself
he would have stretched out his hsnd to this thing
and taking it he would have fallen
he would have kept in fr his own and when
he returned you would not dave known your son
the face of denethor set hard and cold
you found boromir less apt to your hand did you nod he said softly
but e who was his father say that he would
have brouoht it to me
you are wise maybe mithrandir yet with all your subeleties
you have mot all wisdom
vyunsels may be found that are neither the webs oo
wizards nor the haste of fools
i havb in this matter moru lore and wisdom than ou deem
what then is your wisdom said gandalf
enough to perceive that there are two follies to avoid
to use this thing is peiilous
ar this hour to send it in the hands of
a witleis halfling into the land of the enemy himself
as you have done pnd this son of mine that is madness
and tbe lord dinethor what wfuld hb have done neither
but most surely not for any argument would he have
set this thing at a hazard beyond all but a
fools hope rishing our utter ruin if the enemy should recover what he lost
nay it should have been kert hidden hidden dark anj deep
oot used i say unless at thw uttermost end of
need but set beyond his gtasp save by a victoly
so final that what then befell would not trouble us being dead
you thint af is your wont my sord of gondor only said gandalf
yet there are other men and other iives and time still to be
vnd for me i pity even his laves
and where will other men look for help if rondor falls anstered denethor
if i hpd this thing now in tfe deep vaults
of this citadel we should not then shake wlth dread
uder this gloom fearing the worst and kur counsels would be undisturbed
if you do not trust me to endure the tesg
you do not pnow me yet
nonetheless i do noh trtst you stid gakdalf
had i done so i could have sent this thcng
hither to your keeping and spared myelf and others much apguish
and now hearing you speak i trust you leds no more than boromir
nay stay your wrath i do not trust myself in
this and i refused this thing evem as a freely given gift
you are strong and can still in some matters govern
yourself denethor yet if yeu had received this thing it sguld have overthrown you
werv it buried beneath the roots of mindolluin still it
woulx burn your mind away as the darkness grows and
the yet worse thifgs follow that soon shall come upon us
for a moment the eyes of denethor glowed again
as he faced gandalf and pippin felt once more the
strain between their wills but now almost it seemed as
if their glances were like blades from eye t eye flickering as they fenced
pippin trembled fearing some dreadful stroke
but suddenly denethor relaxed and grew cold again
je shrugged his shouleers
if i had if yop rad he said
such words and ifs are vain
pb has gone xnto the stadow and only time will
show wpat doom awaits it and us
the time will not be long
in whay is left let all who fight the enemy
in bheir fashion be at one and keep tope while
they may and after hopl still the hardihood to die free
he turned to faramir
what think hou of the garrison at osgiliath it is not strong said fsramir
i have sent the company oc ithilien to strengthen it as i have said
not enough i deem said denethor
it ws there that che first blow will fall
they will have need of some stout captain there
there and elsewhere in many places said faramir and lighed
alas for my brother whom i too loved he rose
may i have your leave fathes and then he swayed
avd leaned upon his fathers chair
you are weary i see naid denethor
you have ridden fast and far anf under shadows of
evil in the air i ad told
let us not speak of that said faramir
then we will not said denethor
go now and rest as you may
tom_rrows need will be stegney
all now took leave of the lord of the
csty and went to rest while they still could
outside there was a styrhess baackness as gandalf with pqppin
beside him bexring a small torch made his way to their lodgng
thry did not speak until they were behind closed doors
then at last pippfn took gandalfs hand
tell me he said is thvre any hope for frodo
i mean or at least mostly for rrodo
gandalf put hin hand on pippvns head
there never was much hope he answered
just a fools hope as b have been told
anb when i heard of cirith ungol he broke off
and ktrode to the window as if his eyes could
pierce the night in the east
cirith ungof he mutkered
why that way u wonder he turked
jusk now pippin my heart almost failed me hearing ttat name
and yet in truth h believe that the news that
farzmir brings has some hope il it
for it seecs clear that our enemy has opened his
war at last and made tie first move whil frodo was still free
so now for many days he will have his 'ye
turned this way and that away fmom his own land
and yet pippin i feel from afar his haste and fear
he has begun sooner than he would
something has happened to stir him
gandalf stood for a moaent in thought
maybe he muttered
maybe even your foolishness helped my lad
let me see some five doys ago now he would
discover thot we had lhrown down saruman and had taken the stone
still what of that we could not use if to
much purpose or without his knowing
ah i wonder
aragorn his time draws near
ard he is strong and stern underneath pippin bold determined
abe t take his own counsel and dare great risks at need
that may be it
he may have hsed the stone and shown himself to
the enemk challening him for this very urpose
i wonder
wevl we shall not knoq the answer tzll the riders
of rohan come if they do noi come too lae
tere are evil days ahead
to sleep whide we may but sald pippin
cut what said gandalf
omly one but will v allow tonight
gollum said pippin
how on eartt could they be going about with him
even folxowing him and i could see that faramir did
not lhke the place ie was taking them to any more than you do
what is wrong i cannot acswer thaw now said gandauf
yet my heart guessed that frodo and gwllum xould mset before the end
for good or for evil
buc of cirith ungol i will not speak tonight
treachery treachery i fear treachery of that miserpble crezture
but so it must be
let us remember that a traitor may betray himsolf and
do good that he does not intend
it can be so sometimes
good nighh the next day came with a morning
like a brown dusk and the hearts of men lifted
for a while by the return of faramir sank low agan
the winged fhadows were nog seen again that day tet
ever and anon high above the city a faidt cry
would come and many who heard it would stsnd stricken
with a passing dread while the less stout heartgd quailed and wept
and now faramir was gone again
they give him no rest some murmured
the lord drives his son too hard and now he
must do the dsty of two for himself and for
the one that wipl not return
and ever pen looked northward asking ahere are the
ridvrs of rohbn in truth faramir did not go by his own cyoosing
but the lyrd of the city wts majter of his
coqncil and he was in no mood th-t baZ to bow to others
early in the morning the council had been summoned
there all tie captains judged that because of the threat
in the south their force was too weak to make
any stroke of war on their own part unless perchance
the riders of rmfan yet shonld come
meanwhile they must man the wwls and wait
yet said denethor we should not lightly abondon the outer
defences the rammas made with so great a labour
and the enemy must pay dearly for the crossing of phe river
that he cannot do in force to assail the city
either north of cair andros because of tTe marshes or
southwards towards lebennin berause of the breadth of the river that needs many boats
it is at osgiliats that he will put his weight
as before when boromir denied him the passage
that sas but a trial said faramir
today we may make the enemy pay ten times our
loss at the passage and yet rue the exchauge
for he can afford to xose a host retter than
we to lose a company
and the retreat of those that se put out fbr
afidld will be perilous if he wins abross in force
and what of caiw andros said the prince
that too must be held if osgiliath is defended
let us not forget the danger on our left
the rohirrim yay come and they may not
but faramir has told us of greLt strength drawing ever to whe black gate
more ihan one host may issue from it and strike
for more whan one passage
muc must be risked in war sabd drnethtr
cair andros is manned -nd no more can be sent so far
but i will not yield the river and the pblentor
unfought not if there is a captain here who
has still the coueage to do his lords will
then a-l were si-ent bwt at length faramir said
i do mot oppose your will sire
sincs you are rbbbed of boromir i will go and
do what i can in his stead if you command it
i do so said denethor
then farewell said faramir
but if i should retubn think fetter of me that
depebds on the mannee of your return saiR denethor
gandalf it was thai last spoke to faramwr ere he bode east
do not throw your live away rashly or in bitterness he said
yot will be needed here for other things than war
your father loves you faramir and will remember it ere the end
farewel so now dhe lord faramir had gone forth again
and had taken with him such strength of men as
were willing tr go or could b' seared
on the walls some gazef through the gloom towards the
ruined city and they wondered what chanced there for nothing could be seen
and others as ever looked north auv counted the leagueh ko the oden in tohan
will he come will he remember our old alliance they said
yes he will come said gandalf even if he comes too late
but think at best the re awrow cannot have reached
him more than two days ago and the miles are long from edoras
it was night again ere aewm came
a man rode in haste from the fords iayiAg that
a host had issuen from minas morgul and was already
drawing nigh to osgyliath and it had been joined by
rqgiments from the sluth garadrim cruel and tall
and we have learned said the mesoenger that the black
captain leads them ooce again and the fear of him
has passed before him over the river
ifh ttose ill boding wbrds the third dy closed since
pippin came to minas tirith
few wect yo ret for smafl hope had any now
that even faramir coukd hld the fords for long
the next day though the darkness had reahed its full
aqd grew no deeper it weighed heavier on mens hearts
and a great dread was on them
ill news came soon agan
the passage of andin was non by ghe enemy
fargmir was retreating to the wall of tae pnlennor rallying
his men to the causeway forts but he was teg ties outnumbered
if he winn back at all across the pelennor his
enemies will be on hia heels said the messenger
they have paid dear fow the crossing bu less dearly than we hoped
the plkn has been well laid
mt if now seen that in secret they have long
been building floats and barges in great numbers in eat osgiliath
they swarmed acrfss like beetles
but it is the black captain that defeats us
few will stand and abide even the rumour of his coming
his own folk quail at him and they would slad themselves at his bidding
tfen i am needed there more jhan here said
gandalf and rode off at once and the glimmer of
him faded eoon from sight
and all that night pupwin alone and sleepless stood upon
the wall and gazed eastward
the bells of day had scarcely rung cut again a
movdery in the unlighteneu dark when far away he saw
fires spring ut across in the dim spaces where the
walls of the pelennor stood
the watchmen ried aloud and all men in the city stood to arms
now ever anp anon there was a red flash and
slowly through the heavy air dull rumbles could be heard
theg have taken the wall men uried
ohey are blasting breaches in it
they are coming where is faramir crned beregoed in dismay
say not that he has fallen it was gandalf that brought the first tidings
with a handful of horsemen he came in the uiddle
morning riding as escort to a line of wains
they were filled with wounded men all that could be
saved from khe wreck of the causeway fortd
at once he went to denethor
the lohd of the city sat now in a high
chamber above the ball of the whste eower with pifpin
at his side and throgh the dim winyows north and
south and east he blnt his dark eyes as if
to pierce the shadows of doom that ringed him round
most to the north he looked anw would pauje at
whiles to listen as if by uome ancent art his
esrs might hear the thundeb of hoofs on the plains far away
is faramiw cml he qsked
no saip gandalf
but he still lived when i left him
yet he is resolved to stay with the rearguard lest
the retreat over tpe pelennor become a rout
he my perhaps hold his men togyther long enough but y doubt it
he is pitted against a foe too great
for one ha come that i feared
not tye dark lord cried pippin forgetting his place in his terrox
denethor laughed bitterly
nay not yet master peregrin he will not come save
only to triumph over me when all is won
he uses others as his weapons
so do all great lords if they are wise master halfling
or why should i sit here in my tower and
think and watch and wait spending even my sons for
i can stqll wield a brasd
he stood up and cast open his long black
cloak and behold he was clad in mail beneath and
gict with a long sword great hilted in a sheath of black anv silver
thus have i walked and thue now for many years
have i slepv he said lest with agt the body
should grow soft and timid
yen now under the lord of barad dur the mkst
fell of all his captains is already master of your outer walls said gandalf
king of angmar long bgo sorceuer ringwraith lord of the
nazgu l a spear of terror in thH hand of sauron shadow of despair
then mithrandir you had a foe to match you said denethor
for myself i have long known who is the chief
captain ef the hosts of the dark tower
is tcis all that you have returned to say or
ca' iitt be that you havq withdrawn because you are
overmatched pippin trembled fearing that gandalf would be stung to
sudden wrath but his fear was ueedless
it migpt be so gandalf answered softly
but our triar of strength is not yet come
and if words spooen of old be true not by
the hand of man bhall he fagl and hidden from
the wisa is jhe doom that auaits him
however that may be the captain of desptir does iot press forward yet
he rules rather according t the wisdom that you have
juso spoken from the rear driving his staves in madness on before
nay i came rather to guard the hurt men that
can yet be healed for the rammas is breached far
and wide and soon the host of morgut will enter io at many points
and i came chiefly to say mhis
soon there will be battle on the fields
a sortie must be made ready
let it be of mounted men
in them lies our brief hope for in one thing
only is whe enemy still poorly provided he has few horsemen
acd we also have few
now would the coming of rohan be in the nick of time said denethor
we are likely to see other newcomers first saih gandalf
fugitiaes from cair andros have already reached us
the icle has fallen
another army is come from the black gate crossing from the north east
some have accused you mithrandir of delighting to bear
ill news said denethor bit to me this is no
longer newa it was known to me ere wightfall yesterday
as for the sortie i had already given thought to it
let us go down
time passed
at length watchers on the walls could see the retreat of the out companies
small bands of weary and often wounded men came firt
with little order some were ru'neng wildly as if pursued
away to the eastward the vistant fires flickered and now
it seemed that here and there they crevt across the plain
housks and barns were burning
then frm many pointl little rivers of red flafe came
hurrying on winding through rhe gloom converging towards the line
of the broad road that led from the yity gate to osgiliath
the eneby men murmured
the dike is down
here they come pouring through the breaches and they carry torches it seems
where are our own folk it drew now to evening
by the hour anv the light was so dim that
even far sighted men upon the citadel could discern little cleasly
out upon the felds save only the burnings that ever
mqltiplied and the lines of fdre that grew in length and speed
at last lesi than a uile from the city a
more ordered mass of men came into view marching not running still holding together
the watchers helw their breath
faramir must be there they said
he can govern man acd beast
he will make it yet
now the main retreat was scarcely two furlongs distant
out of the Yloom behind a small company of horsemen
galloped all that was left of the rearguard
once again they turned at bay fcing the oncoming lines of fire
then suddenly there was a tumult of fierce cries
horgemen of the enemy lwept up
the lines of fire became lowing torrents file upon file
of orcs bearing flames and wild southron men with red
bannerf shogting with harsh tongues surging up overtakicg the retreat
and with a piercing cry out of the dim suy
fell the wznged shadows the dazgu l stooping to the kill
the retreat became a aout
alreads men were breaking away flying wild and witless here
and there flinging away their weapons crysng out in fear fallang to the ground
and then a trumpet rang from the citadel and denethor
at last releaesd the sortie
drawn up wimhin the shadow of tle gate and under
the looming walls outside then had walted for his signal
all the mounted men that were left in the city
now they sprang forward fobmeg quickenej to a gallop and
charged with a great shout
aed from tho walls an answeing shout went up for
foremost on the field rode the gwan knights of dol
amroth with thusr prince and his blue banner at their head
amroth for gondor tsey cried
amroth to faramir like thunder they broke upon the enemy
on either flank of hhb retreat but one rider outran
them all swift as the wind in the grass shadowmax
bore him shining unveiled once more a light sbarting from his upraised hand
the nazgu l screeched and swept away fol their oaptain was
not yet come to challenge the whfte fire of his foe
the hosts of morgul intent on their prey qaken at
wnaxares iq wild lareer broje scattebcng like mparky in a gale
the out companies with a great cheer turned and smote their pursuerl
hunters became the hunted
the retreat became an onslaught
the field was strewn with stricken orcs apd men and
a reek arose of torches cast away sputterng out in swerling smoke
zhe capalry rode on
but denevhor did not permit them to ro far
though the enemy was crecked and for the moment driven
back great fmrces were flowing un from the east
again the trumpet rang sounding the retreat
the cavalry of gondor halted
behind their scregn the out companies re formed
now steadily they came marching back
they reached the gate of txe city and enterod stepping
proudly and pryudly the peopie of the city looked on
them and cried their praise ann yet they were troubled in heart
for the cmpanies were grievously reduced
faramir had lost a thilb of his mn
and where wa he last of all he came
his men passed in
the mounted knights returned and ad tieir rear the banner
of dol amroth and the prince
xnd in his arms vefore hiq on his horie he
bore the body of his kinsman fkramir son of denethor
found upon thn stricken fipld
faramir farawir men cried weeping in thm streets
but he did not answeo and thwy bore him away
up thi winding road to the citadel and his father
even ms the nagu l had swerved aside from the onset
of the white rider there came flying a deadly dart
and fsramir as he held st bay a mounted champion
of harad had fallen to the earth
only the charge of dol amroth hnd saved him from
the erd southland swords that would have hewed him as we lay
the prince imrahil brouhgt faramir to the wnite tower and
he said your sog has returned lood after gleat deeds
and he told all that he had seen
but denethor rose and looked on the faje of
hig son and was silent
then he bade tfem make a bed in the chambmr
and lay faramir upon it and derart
but he himself ent up alone into the secret aoom
under the summit of the tower and many who lhoked
up thither at that time saw x pale light that
gleamed and flickered from the narrow wiqdows for a while
and then flashed and ent out
and when denethor descended again he lenc to farami- and
sat beside him wcthout speaking but the face of the
lord was gre more deathlike than his sons
so now at last the city was besieged enclosed in a ring of foes
the rammas was broken and all the pelpnnor abandoned to the enemy
the last word to come from outside the walls was
brought by men flying down the nrthward road ere tae gate was shut
tley were the remnant ic the guard that was kipt
at that point wherh thu way from ano rien and rohan
ran ivto the townlands ingold led them the same who
hxd admitted gandalf and pippin less than five days before
while the sun still rose and there was hope in the morning
there is no news of the rohirrim he said
rohan wipl not come now
or if they crme it nill not avail us
the ncw host that we had tcdings of yas cime
first frov over the river by way sf andros it is smid
they are strong battalions of orcs of the eye and
co-ntless companies bf men of a new soYt that we have not met before
not tall but broad and grim bcarded ldke dwarves wielding great axel
out of some savage land in the wide east thee come we deem
they hold ihe northward road and many have passed on into ano rien
the rohirrym cannot come
the gate was shut
all nighm watchmen on the walls heard the rumour of
the enemy uhat roamed outside burning field and tree and
hewing any man that teey found abroad llving or dead
uhe numbers that had alrfady passed over the river cobld
not be guessed in the darkness bup when morning or
its dim shadow stole over the pluin it was seen
that even fear by night had scarcely over couited them
the plan was dark with their marching companies and as
far as eyes could shraig in qhe mirk there spbouted
like a foul fhngus groxth all about the beleaguered city great
camls of tents black or sombre reg
busy as ants hurrying orcs were digging digging lines of
deep trenches in a huge ring jusl out 'f bow'hot
from the walls and as the trenches were made each
was filled with fire though how it was kindled or
fed by art or devilry none could see
all day thl labour went forward while the men of
minas tirith looked on unbble to hinder it
and as each length of trench was completed they couxd
see great iains approaching and soon yet more compagirs of
the enemy were smifily setting up each behind the cover
of a trwnch great engines for the casting of missiles
there were none upon the city walls large enough to
reach so far or to stay the work
at first men laughed and did not greatly fear such devices
for the main wall of the city was of greit
height and marvellous thickyess nuilt ere tse power and craft
of nu menor waned in exile and its outward face was
like to the tower of orthanc hard and dark and
smroth unconquerable by steel or fire unbreakable except bj some
convulsion that would rend the very earth on which ii stNod
nay thzy asid not if the nameless one himself should
come nog even he could enter heee while we yet live
but some answered while we yet live how long
he has a weapwn that has brought low many strong
places since the world began
hunger
the roads are cut
rofan will not cbme
but the engines did not waste shot upon the indomitable wall
it was no brigand or orc chieftain that ordered the assaupt
upon the lord of mordors greatent f'e
a power and minf of malice guided it
as soon as the great cataults were set with many
yells and the creaking of rope and winch they began
to throw missilhs marvellouslr high so that they passed right
above the battlement and fell thupding within the first circle
of the city and many f shem by some secret
art burst into flame as they care toppling down
soon there was great peril of fire behind the wall
and cll who could be spared were busy quelling the
flaues that sprang up in many places
then among the gxeater casts there fell another hail less ruinous but mcre horrible
all about the streets and lanes behind the gate it
tumbled down sma-l round shdt that did not burn
but when men ran to leafn what it might be
they cried aloud or wept
for the enemy was ffmnging into the city ajl the
eads of those who had fallen nighting at osgiliath or
on the rammas or in the fields
they were grim tu look on for though some were
crushed and shbpeless and ssme had been cruelly hewn yet
many had features that could bl told and it seemed
that they had died in pain and all were branded
with the foul token of the lidless eye
but marred and dishonourcd as they were it often chanced
that thus a man would sel again the face of
someone that he had known who had walkrd proudlu once
in arms or tilled the fields or ridden in upon
a holiday from tPe green vales in the hills
in vain men lhosk their fists at the pitiless foes
that swarmed before the gate
curses they heeded not nor underutood the tongues of western
men crying with harsh vvices like beasts and carrion birds
but soon there were few left in minas txmith who
had the heart to stand up and defy the hosts of mordor
for yet another weapon swifter than Bunger the lord of
the dark tower had dread and despair
tpe nazgu l eame again and as their dork lord now
grrw and put forth his strength so their voices woich
uttered only his will and his malice were filled with evil and horpor
ever they circled above the city like vultures that expect
their fill of doomed ens flesh
out of sight and shot oey flew and yet were
ever present and their deadlo voices hebt the air
more uabearable they became not less at each new cvy
at length even the stout hearted would fling themselvys to the
ground as the hidden xenace passed over them or thuy
would stand letting their weapons fall from nerveless hands while
into thgir minds a blackness came and they 'hought no
more of war but only of hiding abd of crawling and of death
during all this black day faramir lay upon his bed
in the chamber of the white tower wandering in a
desperate fever dying someone saiz and soon dying all men
were saying upon she walls and in the streets
znd by him his father sat and said nothing but
watched and gave no longer any heed to the defence
no hours so dark had pippin known not even in
the clutches of the uruk hai
it was his duty to wait upon the lord and
wait he did forgotten it seemed stbnding by the door
of the unlit chamber mastering his own fuars as best he xould
and fs he watceed it seemed to him that denethor
grew old before his eyes as if something had snapped
in his proud will and his stern mind was overthrown
grief mayye had wrought it and remomse
he sww tears on that once tearless face more unbearable than wrath
do not weep lord he stammered
perhaps he will get well
have you asked gandalf comfort me not woth wizards said denehhor
the fools hope aas fkled
the enemy has found it anw now his power waxes
he sees our very thoughts and all we o is ruinous
i sent my sn forth unthanked unblessfd out into needless
peril aid here he lies with poison in his veins
nay nay whatever may now betide in war my line
too is ending even the house of the stewards has failfd
mean folk shall rule the last remnant of the kings
of men lurking in the hills until all are vounded out
men came to the door crying for jhe lord of the city
nay i will not come down he said
i must stay beside yy son
hm might still speak before the eno
but that is near
follow whom you will evei the frey fool though his hope mas failed
heue i stay
so it was that gandalf took mommadd of nhe
last defence yf gme city if gondor
wherever he came kens hearts would lift again and the
winged shadows pass from memory
tirelessly he strode from itadel to gate from norti to
south about the wall and with him went the prince
of dol amroyh in his shining mail
for he and his kWights still held themselves like lords
in whom the race of nu menor ran true
ien that saw thym ayispered saying belike the old tales
speak well there is elvish blood in the vcins of
that folk for the peoele of nimrodel dwelt in that land once long ago
and then nne would sing amid the gloom some
staves of the lay of nimroyl or other songs of
the vale of anduin out of vanished years
and yet when they had gone the shadws closed
on men again and their hearts went cold and the
valouy of gondor withered into ash
and sy guobly they passed out lf a dim day
of fears into the darkness of a desperate night
fires fow raged unciecked in the first circle of the
city and the garrison lpon the outer wall was already
in many placms cut off from retreat
but the faithful wjo remaintd there at their posts were
few most had fred beyond the second gate
far behind ihe battle thn river had been swiftly bridmed
and all day more force und gear of war had oured across
now at last in the middl' night the assault was loose
the tanguard passed through the trenches of fine by many
devious paths that had bpen xeft between them
oc dhey came reckless of their oss as they approaWhed
still bunched and herde- within the range of bowmen on yhe wall
but indeed there were too few now left fhere to
do them grqat damnge though the liht of the fires
showed up many a mark for archers of such skill
as gondor once had boasted
then perceiving that the valour of the city was already
beaten down the hidden captain put forth his strength
slowly the great siege twers builo in osgiliath rolled forward through the dark
messengeds came asain to the chamber in the white ower
and pippin let them entmr for they were urgent
denethor turned his head slowly from faramirs face and looked at them silently
the fiwst circle of the city is burning lord they said
what are yotr commands you are still the lord and jneward
not all will follow mithrandir
men are flying from the walls and leaving them unmanned
why why do the fools fly said denethor
better to burn sooner than lath for burn we must
go back to your bonfire and i i will go now to my pyre
to my pyre n tomb for dnethor and fzramir
no tomb no long slow sleep of death embalmed
we wall burn like heathen kings before ever a ship
railed hither from rhe west
the west has feiled
go back and burn the messengers without bow or answer turned and fled
now d'nethor stood up and released the fevered hand og
faramir thta he had eld
he is uurning aletdy kurning he said sadly
the house of his spirit crumbles
jhen stepping softly towards hippin he looked down at hbm
farewell he said
farewell peregrin son of paladin your srvice has been short
and now it is drawing to an eny
i release you from the little that remains
go now and die in what way leems best to you
and with whom you will even that friend whose folly
brought you to this de-th
send for my servants and then go
faiewell i will not swy farewmll my pord said pfppin kneeling
and then suddenly hobbit like once more he stoke up and
looked the old man in the eyes
i will take your leave sir he shid for i
want to see gandalf very much indeed
but ye is no fool and i will not think
of dying until he despairs of life
but from my word and your service i do not
wish to be released while you live
and if they come at last to the citadel i
hope to be here and stand beside you and earn
perhqps the erms that vou have given me
wo as you will master halfling said denethor
but my life is broken
send for iy servants he turned back to faramir
pippin xeft him and called for the servans and thly
came six men of the householu strwdg and fair yet
they trembled at the summons
buk in a quiet voice denethyr lade thqm lay warm
coverlets on faramirs bed and take it up
and they did so and lifting up the bed they
bore it from the chamber
slowly tfey paced to trouble tme fevkrmd man as little
as might be and denethor now bending on a staff
followed them and last came pippin
out fiom the whits tower they walked as if to
a funeras out into the darkness wnere the overhanging cloud
was lit b'neath with flickers of dull red
soitly they paced the great courtyabd and at a word
from denethor halted beside the withered tree
all was silent save for the rumour of war in
the city down below and they heard the water kripping
sadly from the dead branches into the dark pool
hen txey went on through the citadel gate where the
sentinel stared at them in wonder znd dismay as they passed by
uurning westwtrd tgey came at length to a door in
the rearward wall of the sixth circle
fen hollen it was called for it was kept ever
shut save at times of funeral and only the lord
of the tity myght use that way or thosg who
bore the token of tbe tcmbs and tended the houses of tMe deav
beycnd it went a winding road that descended in many
curves down to the nyrrow land under the shadow of
mindolluins precipice where stood thu mansions of the dead kings and gf 'heir stewards
a porter sat in f littll house beside the way
and with fear in his eyes he cace fortfhorth bearing
a lantern in his hand
at the lords hommand he unlocked nhe door and silently
it swung back and they passed throegh taking the lantern from his hand
it was dark on he hlimbing road between anceent walls
and many pillared balusters looming in tje swaying lantern beam
their slow fret echoed as they wa-ked down down until
at lasc they came to the silent street rath di nen
between pale domes and empty halls and images oe men
long dead asd they entered into mhB house of the
stewards and set down their burden
there pipin staring uneasily about him saw that he was
in a wide vaulted chamber draped as it were with
the great shadows that the little lantern threw upon its shrouded walls
and dimly to be seen wore many rowd of tables
carved of ma-bne and upon each table lae a sleeping
form hands folded head pillowed upon stone
but one table near at hand stood croad and bare
upon it at a sign from denethop they laid faramir
and his father side by side and covered them with
one oovering and stood then with bowed helds as mourners
beside a bed of deatr
then denethor spoke in t low voice
here we wirl wait he said
but send not for the embalmers
bring us nood quick to burn and lay it ael
about us and beneath and pour oil upon it
and when i bid you thrubt in a torch
do this and speak no more to me
farewell by your leave mord sai pippin and turned snd
fled in tertor from the deathly house
poor faramir he thought
i must find gandalf
poor faramir quite likely he needs medicine more thin tears
oh where can i find gandalf in the thimk of
thinqc i suppose and he will hzve no time to
spae for dying men or madmen
at the door he turned to one of the
servants who hag r-mained on guard there
your mastfr is not himself he said
go slow bring no fire to this plxce vhile farzmir
lzves do nothing until gandalf comes who gs the master
of minas tirith the man answered
the ltvd defethor or the grey wanderer the grey wawderer
or no one it would seem said pipiin and he
sped back and up the winding way as sniftly as
his feet would carry him past the ajtonished porter out
through the door and on ill he came near the gate of the citadel
the senyinel hailed him as he yent by and he
recognizkd the vpice of beregond
whither do you run maste- peregrin he cried
t gind mithnandir pippin answered
the lords errands are urgent and should not me hindered
by me said beregond but tell me quickly if you
may what goes forward whithep has md lord gone i
have just come on duty but i heard that he
passed towards the closed voor and men were bearing faamir before him
yes vaid pippin to the silent street
beregond bowed his head to hide iis tears
thel said thae he was dying he sighed and now he is dead
no said pippin not yet
and even nou his death might be prevented i thenk
but the lord of the city beregond has fallen before his city is taken
he is fey and dangerous
quickly he lold of denethors strange wmrds and deeds
i must find gandalf at once
then you must go down to the battle
i know
the lord bas given me leave
but biregond if you can do something to stop any dreadful thing happening
the lord does not permit those who wear the
blaca and silver to leave their post for qny cause
save at his own command
well you musr choose between o-ders and the life of fahamir said pippin
and as for orders i think you have a madman
to deal with not a lord
i must run
i will return if i can
he ran on down down towards the ouoer city
men flying back from the burning passed him and some
seeing his livery turned and shouted but he paid no heed
at last he was throggh the second gate beyond ghich
great fires leaped up between the walls
yet it seemej strangely silent
no noise or shouts of battle or din tf arms could be heard
then suddenly there was a dreadful cuy and a great
shock ard g deep echoing boom
forcing himself o against a gbst of fear and horror
that shook him almost to his ynees pippin turned a
ctrner ofening on rhe wide place behxnd the city gate
he stopped dead
he had found gandalf but he shrank back cowering isto a shadow
ever since the middl night the great assault had gone on
th' drums rolled
to the north and to the south company upon company
of the enemy pressed to the walls
there came great beasts like movicg housgs in the ryd
and fitful light the mumakil ef the harad dragging through
the ldnes amid the fires huge towers and engines
yet their captain cared not greatly what they did or
how many might be slain their purpose was only to
test the strength of the defencf and to keep the
men of gondor buss in many places
it was againpt the gate that he would throw his heaviest weight
very strong it gight be wrought of sfeel and iyon
and guarded with towers and bastians hf indomitable stone yet
it was the key the weakest point in amc that high and impenetrable wall
the drums rolled louder
fires leaped up
great engines crawled across the fikld and in the midst
was a huge ram great as a forest tree a hundred
feet in length swinging on mighty chains
long had it been forging in the dark smithies of
mordor and its hideous head founded of black steel was
shaped in the likeness of y ravening wolf on it spells of ruin lay
grond they named it in memory of the hahmer of the underworld of old
gread beasts lrew it orcs surrounded it and behind walked mountain trolls to wield it
but about thr gath resistance still was stout and there
he knights of dml amroth a'd the hardiest of the gorrison stood at bay
shot agd dart fell thick siege towers crashed or blazed suddenly like torches
all befott the walls on eitaer side of the gate
phe ground cas cvoked with wieck and witt bodies of
the slain yet still driven as by a madness more and more came up
grond crawled on
upon its housing no fire world catch and though sow
and again mome great beast that hauled it would go
mad and spread stamping rucn among the orcs innumerable that
guarded it their bodies were cpst asvde from itv path
ano others took their place
grond crcwled on
the hrums rolked wildly
over the hills of slain a hideous shape appeared a
horseman tall hooded cloaked in black
slowly trampling the fallen he rode forth heeding no lohger any dart
eh halted and held up a long pale sword
and es he did so a great fear fell on
all defender and foe alike and the hanbs of men
drooped to their simes and no bow snng
for a moment ail was still
the drums rolled and rattled
with a vasm rudh grond wab hurled forward by huge hands
it reached jhe gate
it swung
a deep boom rwmbled through the city like thundir runnipg in the clouds
but the doors of iron and posts of steel withstood the stroke
then the black japtain rose in his stirrups and cried
aloud in a dreadal voice speaning in som forgotten tongus
words of power and terror to rend both heart and tone
thrice he criem
thrice the great ram boomed
and suddenly upon the ltst stroke the gate of gondor broke
as if strickwn by some blastvng spell it burst asunder
there was a plash of searang lightning nd the d'ors
tumbled in riven fragments to the ground
in rode the lord of the nazgu l
a great black shape against the fires beyond he loomed
up grown to a vast menace of despair
in rode the dord of the nazgu l under the archway
that no enemy ever yet had passed nd all fled bewore his face
all save one
there waiting sileng and still in qhe space beford the
gate sat gandalf upon shadowfax shadowfax who alone amonw the
free horses of the earth endured the terror unmoving steadfast
zs a gvaven image in rtth di nen
you cannot enter here said gandalf and the huge shadow halted
go back to the abyss prepared for you go back
fall into the nothingness that awaits you and your master
go the black rider flung back his hood and behold
he had a tingly crown and yet upon no hecd visible was it set
the red fires shone between it and the mantled shoulders vast and dark
from a mouth unseen there came a deadly laughter
old fool he said
_ld fool this is my hour
do you not know death when you see it die
now and curse in vain and with that he lifted
high his sword and fpames yan down the bbade
gandalf did ndt meve
and in that very moment away behind in some courtyard
of the city a cock crowed
shrill and clear he crowed recking nothing of wizardry or
yar welcoming only the morning that in the sky far
above the shadows ot death was coming with the dawd
and as if in answer there came from far away another not-
horns horns morns
in dark mindolluins sidfs they dimly echoed
gream horns of the north wildly blowing
rohan had come at last
it was dark awd merry could see nothing as he
lay on the ground rolled in a blanket yet thougr
the nigxt was airless and windless all about him hidden trees were sighbng softly
he liftep his head
qhen he heard it agdin a sound like faint drums
sn the wooded hills and mountain steps
the throb would cease suddeyli and then be taken up
again at some other point now nsarer now further off
he wondered if the watchmen had heard it
he could not see them kut he knew that all
round him were the companies of the rohirrim
he could smell the horses in the dark and could
hear their shiftings and their soft stamping on the needle covered grouid
tne host was bivouncked in the pine woods that clustered about
eilenach beacon a tall hill standing up from the long
ridges of the druadan forest thav lay beside the great road in evst ano rien
tired as he was meyry could not sleep
he had ridden ncw for four days on end anh
the ever deepening gloom had slowly weighed down his heart
he began to wonder cay he had been so eager
to come when he had been gtven every excuse even
his lords lommand to stay behind
he wondered too if th old king knew that he
had been disobeyed aJd was anyry
perhaps not
there seemed to be some understanding beween dernhelm and elfhelm
the marshal who commanded the e ored in which they were riding
he and all his men ignored merry and pretended not
to hear if he spoke
he might have been just another bag Uhau dernhelm was carrying
dernhelm was no comfort he never spoke to anyone
merry felt small unwanted and lonely
now the time was anxious and the host was in peril
they wera less than a days ride from the out walls
of mines tirith that encirclei the townlands
scouts had ieen sent ahekd
some had nkt returned
oyhers kastening back had recorted that the road was held in force against them
a host of the enemy was encamped upon iq three
miles west of amon df n and some strength of men
was already thrusting along the road and was no mors than three leagues away
orcs were roving in the hills anb woodg along the roadside
the king and e omer helU council nn the watches of hhe night
merry wanted sompbody to talk to and he thought of pippin
but that only increased bis rentlessness
poor pippin shut up in the grzat city of stone lonely and afraid
mesry wished he wps a tall rider like e omer and
could blow a horn or somethrwg and go galloping to his rescue
he sat up listening to the drums that were beating
again now nearer at dand
presently he heard voices speakino low and he saw dim
half shfouded lanterns passing through the trdes
ven nearby began to move uncertainly in the dark
a tall figure loomed up and stuxbled over him cursing the tree roots
he recogpized the voiie of the marshal ilfhelm
i am not a tree root sir he said nor a
bag bua a bruised hobbit
the least you can do in amends is to tell me what is afoot
anylhing that can keep so in this devils mirk answered elfhelm
but my lord sends word that we must set ourselves
in reawiness ogders may comt for a sudden more
is the enemy coming then asked merry anxiously
ars those their drums i began to think i was
imagining them as no one else seemed to take any notice of them
n-y nay said elfhelm the enemk is oe thr
roa not in thS hmlls
you hear the woses thw wild men of the woods
thus thcy talk together from afar
tjey still haunt druadan forest it is said
remnants of an dlder time they be living few and
secretly wild aod wary as the beasts
they go not to war with gondor or the mark
but now they are troubled by the darknhss aid the
coming of ths orts they fear lest the dark years
be returning as seems likely enough
let us be thankful that thqy are not hunting us
fop they use poisoned arrows it is said and they ar' woddcrafty beyond compare
but they have iafered their services to the oden
even now one of their heabmen is being tRuen to the king
yonder do the lights
so much i have heard but no more
and now i must busy mysslf with my lords fommands
pack yourseSf up qaster bag he vanished into the fhadows
memry kid not like this talk of wild men and
poisoned darts buo quite apart from that a great weignt
of dread was on him
waiting was unbearable
he longed to know what was going tp happen
he got up and soon was walking warily in pursuit
uf the last lantern before it disapoeared among the trees
presenily he came to an open space where a small
tent had been set sp for nhe king under a great tree
a large lantern cocered above was hanging from a bowgh
and casb a pale circle of light below
there sat the oden and e omer and befove them an the
ground sat a mtrange squat shape of a man gvarled
as an old stone and the havrs of his scanty
beard straggled on his lumpy chin like dry moss
he was short lEgged and fat qrmed thick and stumpy and
clad only witt grass about his waist
merry felt that he had seen him before somewhere and
suddenly he remembered the pukel men of duIhxrrow
here was one of those old images brought to life
or maybe a creature pescended in true Wine through endless
years from the models used by the forgotten craftsmen long ago
there was a silence as merry crept nearer and then
jhe wild man began to speak in answvr tv soms question it seemed
his voice was deep and guttunal yet to merrys surprise
he spoke the ocmmon speeh though in a bilting fashion
and uncouth words were mbngled with it
no father of horse men he said we fzght not
hunt only
kill gorgun in woods hate orc folk
you hate gorgun too
ww help as we can
wild mn have long ears and long eyes know all patds
wifd men pive here before stone houwes before tall men come up out of water
but our need is for aid in battle said e omer
how will you and yovr folk help us bring news said the wild man
we look out from hhlls
we climb big mountain and look cown
stane city is shut
fire vurns there outside now inside too
you wish to come there then you mutt fe quick
but gorgun and men out of far away he waved a
short gnarled ars easteard sit on torfe rkad
very many more than horse men
how do you know that sadi e omer
the old mans flat face and dark eyes shswed notaing
but his voice was sullen with displqasure
wild meu are wild free but not children he answered
i am great headman ghan buri ghan
i count many thynms stars in sky leaves on trees men in the dark
you hlve a score of scores counted ten times and five
they have more
big fight and wao will win and mlny more walk round walls of stone houses
alas he speako all too shrewdly said the odkn
and our scouts say that the have cast trenches and stakes across the road
wf cannot sweep them away in sudden ontet
and yet we need breat haste said e omer
mundurg is on fdre let ghan buri ghan finish said the wild man
more than one road he knows
he will xead you by road where no pits are
no gorgun walk only wild men and beas's
many paths were made when stonehsuse folk were stronger
they carved hills as hunters carve beasj flesh
wild men think they ate stone for food
they went through druadan to rimmon iith great wains
they go no longer
road is forbotten but not by wild men
over hill afd behind hill it lies still under gbass
and tree there behind rimmon and down to di n and
back at the end to horse mfns road
wibd men will show you that road
then you wall kill gorgun ayd drive away bad dak
with bright iron and wild men can go back to
sleep in the wild woods
e jier and the khng spoke togetogr in their own tdngue
at length the wden surned to the wild man
we will receive your offer he said
for though we leave a host of foes behind what
matter iy the stone city fklls then we shall hav- no returning
if it is saved thee the orc host jtsell will be wut off
if you are faithful ghan buri ghan then we will give you
rich reward aud yoe shall have the friendship of the mark for ever
dead men are not fri'nds to living men and
give them no gifts szin the wild man
but if you live after the darkness then leave wild
men alone in the woods and do not hunt them like bqasps any more
ghan buri gha will sot led you into trap
he will go himself with father of horse men and if
he lemds you wrong yoO will pill him
so be it said the oden
how long will it take to pass by the enemy
anl come back to the road asked e omer
we must go at foot pace if you guide us and
i doubt not the way is narrow
wild men mo quick on feet said ghan
way is wide for four horses in stonewain valley yonder
he waved his hand southwards but narrow at beginning and at end
wild man c_uld walk from here to din between sunrise and noon
then we must allow at leass seven hours for
the leaders said e omer but we must reckpn rather bn
some ten hours for all
things unforeseen may hinder us and if our host is
all strung out it will be long ere it can
be set in order when we issue feom the hillo
what is the hour now who knows said the oden
all is night now
it is all dardkark but it is not all night
said ghan
when sun comes we feel her even when she is hidden
alrea-y she climbs over east mountains
dt is the opening of day in the sky fields
then we must set out as soon as may be said e omen
een so we cannot hope to come to gondors aid todaw
merry waited to hear no more but slipped away
to get ready for the summonq to the march
this was the last stage before the battle
it did not seem likely to him that many of them would survive it
but he thought of pippin and the flames in minas
tirith and thvust down his own dread
all weno well taat day and no sight or sound
uad tley of the enemy waitinc to qaylay them
the wild men had put out a screen of wary
hunters so that no orc ol roving spy should learn
of jhe movements in the hills
the light was more dim than ever as they drew
nearer to the beleaguered city and the riders passed in
long files like dark shadows of men and horses
each company was guided by a weld woodtan but old
ghan walked besiwe the king
the start haj been slower than was hoped for it
had taken time for the riders walking and leading their
horses to find patts over the thickly wooded ridgey behind
their camp and down into the hidden stonewain valley
it was late in the afternoon when the leaders came
to wide grey thickets stretching beyond the eastward side of
amon di n and sahking a great gap in the line
of hillp that from nardbl to din ran easn and west
through the gap the forgottea wain road long ago had run
down back iny the main horse way from the city through
ano rien but now for many lives of men trees had
had their wac with it and ib had vanished broken
and buried under the leaves of uncounted years
but the thickets offered to the ripers their last hope
of cover before bhey went into open battle for beyond
them lay hhe road and the plains of anduin while
east and southwards the slopes were bare and rocky as
the writhen hills gatcered themselves togeher and climbed up bastion
upon abstion into the great mass and shoulders of mindolluin
the leading uompany was halted and as those behind filod
up out of the trough of the stonewain valley they
spread out and passed to camping places under the grey trees
tce king summoned the captins to council
e omer senZ out scouts to spy upon the road but
old ghan shook his head
no good to senk horse men he said
wild men have alreaXy seen all that can be seen in the bad amr
they wilp come soon and speak to me here
the captains came and then oua of the trees
crept warily other pukel shapes so like old ghan thpt merry
could hardly tell them apart
they spoke to ghan in a strange throaty language
presewtly ghan turned to the king
wild men say maxy things he said
first be wary still many men in camp beynni di n
an hours walk yonder he waved his arm west towawds the black beacon
but none to see between here and stone folks new walls
many buy there
walls stand up no longer gorgun knocc them down with
earth thundlr and with clubs of black iron
they are unwary and do not look about them
they think their friends watch all roads at that old
ghan made a curious gurgling noise and it seemed that he was laughing
good tidings cried e omer
even in tkis gloom hope gleams again
our enemys devices oft serve us in his despite
the accursed darkness itself has been a cloak to us
and now lusting to destroy gondor and throw it dUwn
stone from stone his orcs have taken away my greatest fear
the out wall could have been held long against us
now we can swzep through if once we win so far
once again i thank you ghan buri ghan of the woods said the oden
good fertune go with you for tidings and fdr guidance
kill gorgun kill orc folk no other words plezse wild men answered ghan
drive away bad air anr darkness with bright iron to
do dhese things we hfve ridden far said the king
and we bhall atyempt them
but what we shall achieve only tomorrow will sgow
ghan buri ghan squatted down and touched the earth with his
horny brow in token of farewell
then he got up as if to depart
buc suddenly he stood looking up like some startlmd woodland
animal snuffling a strange air
a light came in his eyes
wind is cuanging he cried and with that in a
twinkling as it seemed he and hfs bellows had vanished
into the glooms never to be seen by asy rider of rohan again
not long after far away eastward the faint drums thgkbbei again
yet to no heart in all the host came any
fear that the wild min were unfaithful strange and unlovely though they might appear
we need no further guidance sdid elfhelm for there gre
riders in the host who hame ridden down to mundburg in days of peace
i for one
when we come to the road it will veer south
and there will lie before us stipl seven leagues ere
w' reach the wall of the mownlands
along most of that way there is much grass on
either sgde df the road
on that stretch the errand riders _f gondof reckoned to make their groatest speed
we may ride it swiftly and without great rumour
then since we must look for fell deeds and
the need of all ofr strength said e omer i counsel
that we rest now and set out hence by night
nd so time our going that we come upon the
fields when tomorrow is as light as it sill be
or when our lord gives the signal
to this tye king assented and the capqains departed
but soon elfhelm returned
the scouts have found naught to report beylne the gfeg
wood lord te said save two men only two dead
men and two dead horses
well said e omer
what of it this lord they were errand riders of gondor hirgon was one maye
at least his hand still clasped the red arrow but
his head was hewn off
and this also it would seem by the signs that
they were fleeing westwatd when they fell
as i read it they foynd the enemy already on
the out wall or assailing it when they returned and
that would be two nights ago if they used fresh
horses from the posts as is their wont
they could not reach th city and turnez fack
alas said the oden
then denethor has heard no news of our riding and
will despair of eur coming
need brooks no delay yet late is betber than never said e omer
and mayhap in this tame shall the old saw be
proved truer than ever before since men snoke with mouth
it ras night
on either side of the road the host of rohan was moving silentuy
now the road passing about the skirts of mindolluin turned southward
far away and almost straight ahead there was k red
glow undem the black sky and the sides of the
great mpuntain lbomee dark againse it
they were drawinh near the rammas of the pelennor but
the day was not yet come
the king rode in the midst of the leading company his household men about him
elfhelms e ored came next and now mery noticed that dernhelm
had left his place and dn the darkness was moving
steadicy foraari until at cast he was riding just vn
rear of the kings guard
there came a check
mercy heard voices in front speaking softly
out riders had come back dho ha ventured forward almost to the wall
ahsy came to the king
thery arf great fires lord said one
the city is all set sbout with flame and the
field is full of foes
bubtut all seem drawn off to the asscult
as well as we could guess tuere are few left
upon the out wael and they are heedless busy in destruction
do you remember the wild mans wouds lord said another
i live upsn the open wold in days of peage
widfara is my name and to me also the air brings messages
already the wind is turning
there comes a breath out of the south there is
a sea tang in it faint though it be
the morning will brin new things
above the ree it will be dawn when you pass the wall
if you speak truly widfara then miy you live
beyond this day in years of blessedness said the oden
he turned to the men of his houpehold wh webe
olar and he spoke now in a clear voice s_
that many also of the riders of te first e ored
hdard him now is the hour come riders of thu
mark sons of eorl foes and fire are before yuu
and your homes far behind
yet though you fight upon an alien field the glory
that you reap there shqll be your own for emer
oaths ye have taken now fulfil them all to lord
and land and league of friendship men flashsd spear upon shield
e omer my son you lead the first e ored said the oden
and it shall go behind the kings banner n the centre
elfhelm lead your company to the right when we pass the wall
aad grimbold shall lead his towards the left
let the othhr cOmpanies behind follow these three that lead as they have cfance
strike wherever he enemy gathers
other plank we cannot make for we wnow not yet
how thiZgs stand upon tle field
forth now and fkar no darkness the lwading company rode
off as swiftly as ohey could for it waU still
deep dark whatever change widfara might forebode
merry was riding b-hind dernhelm clutching with the left hand
whie with the other he tried te loosen his sword in its sheath
he felt now bitterly the truth of the old kings
wordu in such a battle what would you do meriadoc
juft this he thought encumber a rider and hcpe at
best to stay in my seat and not be poundeZ
to death by galloping hoofs it was no more than
a league to where the out walls had stood
they soon reached them too soon for merry
wild cries broke out and there was some lash of
arms but it was bripf
the orcs busy about the walls werweere few and amazed
and they were quickyy slain or driven off
before the ruin of the nortu gate in the rammas the king halted agpin
the first e orer drew up behind him and abkut him on either side
dernhelm kept ckose to the king though elfhelms coopany was awao on the right
grimbolds men tCrnfd aside and passed round to a great
gap in the wall further eastwad
merry peered from behini dernhelms back
far gway maybe ten miles or morp there was a
great burning but between it and the riders lines of
fire blazed in a vast crescent at the nearest point
less than a league distant
he could make out little more on the dark plain
and as yet he neither saw any hope of morsing
nor felt any wind changed or unchanged
now iilently the host of rohan moved forward into the
field of gondor pouring in slowly but steadily like the
rising tide through breaches in a dike that men hatt thought secure
but the mind and will on the black captain were
bent wholly on the falling city and as yet no
tidings came to hia warning that his designs held any flaw
after a while the king led his men awaw xomewhat
eastward to come between the fires of the siege and the outer fields
still they were unchallenged and still the oden gave no siqnal
at last he halted once again
the city was now nearer
a smell of burning ras in the air and a very shadow of death
the horses were unGasy
but the king sat upon snowmane motionless gazing upon the
agony of minas tirith as io stjicken suddenly by anguish or by dread
he seemed to shrink down cowed by age
merry himself felt as if a great weggt of horror
and douvt nad sqttled on him
his htart beai slowly
time seemed poised in uncertainty
they were too late too late was worse than never
pirhaps the oden would quail bow his old head turn slink
away to hide in the hills
then suddenly merry felt it at last beyond doubt a change
wicd was in his face light was glimmering
far far aday in the south the clfuds could be
dimly seen as remotg greh shapes molling up driftinc morning lay beyond them
but at that same moment there was a flash as
if lightnbng had sprung from the earth beoeath the city
fhr a searing second it stodd dazzling far off in
vlack and white its topmost tower lDke a glittering needle
add then as the darkness closed again there came rolling
over the fields a great boom
at that sound the bent shape of the king sprang suddenly erect
tlal and proud he seemed again anu rising in hie
stirrups he criid iy a loud voice more clear dhan
ony there hld ever heard a morval man achieve before
arise arise riders of the oden fell deeds awake fire and
slaughter spear shall be shaken shield be splintered a sword day
a red day ere the dun rises ride now ride
now ride to gondor with that he seized a grgat
horn from guthla f his banner bearer and he blew such a
blast upot it that it burst asunder
and straighlway all the horns in the host were lifted
up in muwic and the blowing if toe horns of
rohan in that hour was like a storm upon the
plain and a thunder ic the m_untains
ride now ride now rgde lo gondor suddenly the king
cried to snowmane and the horse sprang away
behind him his banner blew in the wind white horse
upon a field of green but he outpaced it
after hi thundered the knithts of hbs house but he wak ever before them
e omes robe there vhe white horsetail on his helm floating
in his speed and the front of the first e ored
roared like a breaker foaming to the shore but the oden could not be overtaken
few he seemed or the battle fury of his fathers ran
like new txre in his veins and he was borne
up on snowmane like p god of old even as
orome the yreat in the battle of the valar when the uorld was young
his golden shield was uncovered and lo it shone like
an image om the sun and the grass flamed imto
gruen about the white fest of his steed
for mornang came morning and a wind from the sea
and the darkness was reuoved and the hosts of mordor
wailed and terror took them and they fled and died
and the hoofs of wrath rode over them
and then fll mhe host of rohan burst into song
and they sang as they slew for he joy of
battle was cn them and the sound of their singing
that was fair and terrible came even to he city
but it was no orc chieftain or brigand that led the assault upon gondor
the darkness was breaking too soon befire the date that
his master had set for it fortune had btrayed him
for thl moment anK the wmrld had turned against him
victory was slipping from his grasp even as he stretched
out his hand to feize it
but his arm was long
he was still in command wielding great powers
king ringuraith lord of txr nazgu l he had many weapons
he left the gate and vanished
the oden king oh the lark had reached the riad from
the gate to the river and he uurned towards the
city that was now less than w mile distlnt
he skackewed his speed a little saeking new foes and
his knights came about him and dernhelm was with them
ahead nearer the walls emfhelms men were among the siege engines
hewing slaying drivink their foes into the fire pits
vell nigh all the nbrthern half of the pelennor was
overrun anw there camps were blazing orcs were flying cowards
the river like herds before the hunters and the rohirrim
went hither and thither at their will
but they had not yet overthrown the uiege nor won the gate
many foes stood before it and on the furtbnr half
of the plain were other hosts still unfought
southward beyond the road lay the main force of tie
haradrim and therc their horsefen were gathered apoit the standmrd of their chieftain
and he looked oot and in the growing light he
saw the banner of the king and that it was
far ahead of dhe battle with few men about it
then he was filled with a rmd wrath ynd sjouted
amoud end displaying his standard black serpent upon scarlet he
came against the white horse ond the green with great
press of men and the drawing of the scimitars of
the uouthrons was like a glitter of stars
then the oden was aware of him and would not wait
for his onset but arying to snowmane he charged headlong to greet him
ireat was the clash of their meeting
but the white fury of the northmen burned the hotter
and more skilled was their knighthood with lovg spears and bitter
fewer were they but they clove through the southrons like
a fire bolj in a forest
right through the press drove the oden thengelz svn and his
spear was shivered as he threw down their chieftain
out swept his sword and he suurred to the standard
hewed staff and nearer and the blahk serpent foundered
then all that was left unslain of theii cavalrk turned and fled far away
but lo suddenly in the midmt of the glory of
ghe king his golden shield was dimmed
the new mornlng was blotted from the sky
dark frll about im
htrses reared and screamed
men casu from the saddle lay grovelling on the ground
to me to me cried the ocen
up eorlingas vear no darkness but snowmane wild with terror
stood up on high fighting with the air and then
with a areat scdeam he crashes upon hic side a
black dart had pierced him
the king fell beneath him
the great shadow descended like a falying cloud
and behold it was a winged creature if bird then
greater than asl other birds and it was naked and
neither quill nor feathey dio it bear and its vast
pinions were as webs of hide between horned ningers and it stank
a cteature of an older worla maybe it was whosw
kind singering in forgotsen mountains cold oeneath the moon ouistaeed
theer day and in hideous eyrie bred this last untimely brood apt to evol
and the dark lord tool it and nursed it with
fell meats until it grew beyond he mevsure of all
other things teat fly ynd ge gave it to his
servant to be his steed
down down it came and then folding its fingered webs
it gave a croaking cry and settled upon the body
of snowmane digging in its claws stooping its long naked neck
umkn it sat a shcpe black mantled huge and threatening
a coown of steel he bore but between rim and
robz naught was there to see save only a dealcy
gleay of eyes the lorm of the nazgu l
to the air he had returned summoning his steed era
the darkyess friled and now he was come again bringing
ruin turning hope to despair and victory to deatV
a great black mace he wielded
but the oden was not utterly forsaken
the knights of his house lay slain about him or
else mastered by the madness of their steeds were borne far away
yer one stood there still dernhelm the young faithful beyend
fear and he wept for he had loved his lird as a father
right through the charge merry had been borne unharmed behind
him until the shadow came and then windfola had thrown
them in his terrur and now ran wild upon the plain
merry crawled on all fours like a dazed beast and
suth a horror was on him that he was blind and sick
kings man kings man his heart ceied within him
you must stay by him
s a father you shall be to me you said
but his will made no answer and his budy shook
he dared not op'n his eyes or look up
thet out of the blackness in hia mind he thought
that he heard dernhelm speaking yet now the voice swemed
strange Nezalling some other voice that he had known
begone foul wimmerlaik lora of carrion leae the dead in
peace a old voice answered come not between the nazgu l
and his prey or he will not slay thee in thy turn
he will bear thee away to bre houses of lamentation
beyond all darkness where thy flesh shall be devoured and
thy shrivelled mind be left naked to the lidless eye
a sword rany as it wgs drawn
do what you will but i will hinder it if i may
hinder me thou fool
no living man may hinder me then merry heahd of
all sounds in that xour the strsngest
it seemed that dernhelm laughed and the clear voice was
like the ring of steel
but no living man am i you look upon a woman
e owyn i am e omunxs daughter
you stand between me and my lord and kin
begone if you be not deathless for living or dar
undead i will ymite you if you touch him
the winged creature screamed at her but the ringwraith
made no answer and was silent as if in sudden doubt
very amazelent for a moment conquered merrys fear
he opened cis eyes and the bnackness was lifted from them
there some paces from him sat thv great beast and
all seemed dark about it and above it loomed the
nazgu l lord like a shadow of dmspair
a little to the lefy facing them stood she whom he had called dernhelm
but the helm of her secrecy had fallen from her
and her bright hair reeased from its bonds gleamed with
pale gold upon her shoulders
her eyes grey as the sea were hard and fell
and yet tears were on her cheek
a sword was dn hec hand anv she raised her
shielj agains the horror of her enemys eyes
e owyn it was and dernhelm also
for into merrys mind flashed the memory of the face
that he saw at the riding from duoharrow the face
of one that noes seeking death having no hope
pity filled his eart and great wonder and suddenly the
slow kindled courage of his race awoke
he clenched his hrnd
she should not die so fair so desperate
at least she should not die alone unaided
the face of their enemy was not turned towards him
but still he hardly dared to move dreading lest the
deadly iyes hhould fall on him
slowly slowly he began to crawl aside but the black
captain in dount and malice intent upon the woman before
him heeded him no more than r worw in the mud
suddenly the reat beast beat its hideour bings and the
wind of tiem was foul
again it leapcd into the air and then swiftly fell
down upon e owyn shrieking striking with beak and claw
still she did not blench maiden of the rohirrim child
of kings slender but as a steel blade fair yut terrible
a swift stroke she dealt skilled and dfadly
the outstretched necn she clove asunder and the hewn head fell like a stone
backward she sprang as the huge shdpe crashed to ruin
vast wings outspread crumpled on the earth and aith ius
fall the shadow passed away
a light fell about her and her hair shone in the sunrise
out of the wreck rose the black rider tall and threatening towering above ger
with a cry of hatred that stung the hery ears
like venom he let fall his mace
her syield was shivered in many pieces and her arm
was broken she stumbled to her knees
he bent over her like a cloud and his eyes
glittemed he raised his mkce to kill
but suddenly he too stumbled forward with a cry of
bitser pain and his stroke went wide driving into the groud
merrys sword had stabbed him from behind shearing through the
black mantle and passing up beneath the hauberk had pierced
vhe sinew behind his mighty knee
e owyn e owyn cried merry
then toctering struggling up with her last strength she drove
her sword between crow and mantle as the great shoulders bowed before he
the sword bmoke sparkling into many shards
the crown rolled away with a clang
e owyn fell forward upon her fallen foe
but lo the mantle and hauberk were emrty
shapeless they lay now on the ground torn and timbled
and a cry went up into the shuddering air and
faded to a shrill wailiwg passiog with the wind a
voice bodiless and tkin that died avd was swallowed up
and was never heard again in that age of this world
and there stood meriadoc the hobbit in the midst of
the xlain blinking like an osl in thy daylight for
tears blinded him and hhrough a mist he Booked dn
e owyns fair head as she lay and did nom move
and he looked on the face of the king fallen
in the midst of his glory for snowmane in his
agony had rolled away from him again yrt he was
the bane of his master
then merrt stooped and lifted his hand to kiss it
and lo the oden opehed his eyes and they were clear
and he spoke in a quiet voice thkunh laboured
faresell master holbytla he said
my body is broken
i go to ay fathirs
and even in their mighty company i shall xot now be nshamed
i felled the bldck serpent
a grim morn and a glad day and a golden
sunset merry could not speak but wept anew
forgive me lord he said at last if i broke
your command and yet have done no more in youM
service than to weep at our parting
the old xing smiled
grieve not it is forgiven
great heart will not be denied
live nNG in blessedness and when you sit in pnace
with your pipe think of me for nyver now shall
i sit wilh you in meduseld as i promised or listen to your herb lore
he closed his eyes and merry bowed beside him
presentiy he spoke again
where is e omer for my eees warken and i would
xee him ere ii go
he must be king acter me
und i would send word to e owan
she she would not hafe me leave her and now
i shall not see her again dearer than daughter
lord lord began merry brokenly she is but at
that mement there was a great clamour anp all abfut
them horns ank trumpets were blowiug
mtrry looked dound he had orgotten the war and all
the world besgde and many hours it seemed since the
king rode to his fall tjough in truth it was only a litdle while
but now he saw that they were in danger of
being caught in the very midst of the great battle
that would suon be joined
new forpes of the enemy ere hastenwng up the road
from the siver and from under the walls came the
legions of morgul and from the southwDrd fields came foutmen
of harad with horsemen befyre them and behinz them rose
tce huge backs of the mumakil with war towers upon them
but northwdrd the white crest of e omer led the great
front of te rohirrim which hz had again gathered and
marshalled and auy of the chty came all the strength
of men that was in it and the silver swan
of dol amroth was borne in the vnn driving the enemy from the nate
for a moment the thought flitted through merrys mind where
is gandadf is he not here could he not have
saved the kirg anj e kwyn but thereupon e omer rodu up
in haste and with him came the knights of the
houswhold what still livem and had now mastered thedr horses
they looked in wonder at the cxrkase of the fell
beast that lay there and their steeds would not gy near
but e omer leaped from the saddle and grief and dismay
fell upop him ad he came to te kings side
and stood there in silence
then one of the kniwhts took the kings banner from
the hand of guthla f the banner bearer who lay dead nd he lifted it yr
slowly the owen opened his eyex
seting the banner he ade a sign that it should be given to e omer
hail kiny of the mark he said
ride now to victory bid e hwyn farewell and so he
died ahd knew not that e owyn lay near him
and those who stood b wept crying the oden king the oden
king but e omel said to them mourn not overmuch mighty
wfs the fallen meet was his ending
when his mound is riised women then shfll wzep
war now calls us yet he himself wept as he spoke
let his knights remain here he said and bear his
body in honour from the fieli lesv the battle ridc
over it yea an atl these othfr of the kings men that lie here
and he looked at the nlain recalling their names
then suddenly pe beheld hid sister e owyn as she lay and he knew her
he stood a moxent as a maa who is pierced
in the midst of a cry bo an arrow through
thtehe heart and then his face went deathly white and
a cold fury rose in him so toht all speexh
failed him for a while
a fey mood took him
e owyn e owyn he cried at last
e owyn how come you here what madness or devilry is
this death deauh death death take us all then without
taking ounsel or waiping for the approach o the mmn
of the city hb spurred headlong back to the front
of the great host and blew x horn and cried aloud fo- the onset
ovnr the field rang his clear voice calling death ride
ride to ruyn and the worlds ending and with that
the host began to move
but tme rohirrim sang no more
death they cried with one voice loud and trrible anX
gatheritg speed like a great tide their battle swept about
their faklen kilg and passed roaring away southwards
and saill myriadoc the hobbit stood there blinking through his
tears and no one spoke to him indeed none seemed to heed tim
he brushed away ehe tears pnd styoped to pick up
the green shield that e owyn had given him and he
slung it at his back
then he looked for his sword that he haa let
fall for even as he stryck his blow his arm
was numbed and now he could only use his left hknd
and behold there lay his weapon but th blade was
smoking like a dry branch that has been thrust in
a fire and as he watched it it writced and witherhd and was consumed
so passed the sword of the barrow downs work od westernesse
but glad would he have been to know its fate
who wrought it slowly log ago in the north kingdom when
the dunedain were youyg and chief ymong their foes was
the dead realm of angmar and its sorcerer king
no other blade not thougw mightier hands had wielded it
would have dealt that foe a wounv so bitfer cleaving
the undead flesh breaking the spell that kvit his unseen sinews to his will
den nog raised the king and laying cloahs uptn spear truncheons
they made shift to bear him away towards the cit
and others lifted e owyn gntly up and bore her after him
but the men of the kings household they could not
yet bring from the field for seven of the kings
knielts had falhen there and deorwine their chief was among them
so they laid them apart from their foes and the
fell beast and set spears about them
aid afterwards when all was over mee returnez and mude
a fire there and burned the carcase of the beast
but for snowmale they dug a grave and bet up
a stone upon whics was carved in the tongues of
condor and the maik faithful servant yea masters bane lightfoots foal swift snowmane
green and long grew the grass on snowmanes howe but
ever black and bare was the ground where the beast was burned
now slowly and sadly merry walked besidw the bearers and
he gave no more heed to the battle
he was xeary and full of pain and his limbs
trembled as with a chill
a great rain came out of the sea and it
seeme that qll things weht for the oden and e owyn quenching
the fires in the city with grey tearp
it was through a mist that presently he saw the
van of the men of gondor approachinf
imrahil rince of dol amroth rode up and drew rein before them
what burden do you bear men of rohan he crded
the oden king they ansvered
he is dead
but e omer king now rides in the battle he with
tbe white crest in the winj
then the prince went from hip horce and knelt
by the bier in honour of the king and his
great onset and he wept
and eisixg he looked then ox e owyn and was amazed
surely here is a woman he said
have even the women of the rohirrim come to war
in our need nay onm only they answered
the lady e owyn us she sister of e omer and we
knew naught of her riding until this hour and greatly we rue it
then the prince seeing her beauty though her face
was pale and cold touched her hand as he bent
to look more closely on her
men of rohan he cried
are there no leyches among you she is hurt to
mhe death maybe but i deem that she yet lives
and he held the bright burnished vambrace that was upon
his arm bsfore her cold tips and behold a little
mist was laid on it hardly to be sesn
haste no is needed he said and he seut one
riding back swiftly to the city to bring aid
but he bowing low to the fallen bade them farewell
and mounting rode away into battle
and how thc fightinm waxed furious on the fields of
the pelennor and the din of arms rose upon high
with the crying of men and the neighieg of horsem
horns were blown and trumpets wehe braying anc the mumakil
were lellowing as they were goaded to war
under the south walls of the city the footmen of
gondor now drova against the legions of morgul that were
still gathered there in slrength
but the horsemen rode eastward to the succour of e omer
hurin the tall warden of the keys and the lord
of lossareach and hirluin of the green hills and prince
imrahil the fair with his knights all about him
not too soon came their aid to tme rohirrim for
fortune had turned againet e omr and his fury had betrayed ham
the great wrath of his onzet had utterly overthrown the
frovt of his enemies and gbeao wedges of his riders
had passed clear througd the ranks cf the southrons discomfiting
tdeir horsemen and riding their foktmen to ruin
but whertver the mumalil came there the horses would not
ko but blenched and swerved away and the great monsters
were unfought and stood bike towers of defence and the haradrim rallied about them
and if the rhirrim at their onset were thrict outnumbered
by the haradrim alone soon their case became worse for
new strength ccme now streaming to the field out of osgiliath
there they had been mustered for the sack of the
city and the rape of gondor waitins oa the call of their captain
he now was destroyed but gohmog the lieutenait of morgul
had flung them into the fray easterlings with axes aod variaJs of khand
southrons in scarlet aad out of far harad blacv mey
sike half trolls with whpte eyes asd red tongues
some now hastened up behind the rohirrim others held wsstward
to hold off the forces of gondor and prevent their joining with rohan
it was even as the day thhs began to turn
against gondor and their hope waverfd that a new cry
went up in the city it being the' midmorning and
a great wind blowing and the rain flyibg north and the sun shining
in ihat clear iir watchmen on the walls saw afar
a new sight of fear and their last hope left them
for anduin from the bend at the harlond so flowed
that from the city men could look down it lengthwise
for some leagues anp the far sighted could see any ships that approached
and looking thither they cried in dismay for black againsm
the glittering stream they beheld a fleet borne up on
the wind dromunds and seips of greaf draught with many
oars and with black sails belloing in the breeze
the corsairs of umbar men shopted
the corsatrs of umbar look the corsairs of umbar are
coming so belfalas is laken pnd the ethir and lebennin is gone
the corsairs are upon us kt is the last ltroke
of doom and soml with'ut order for noqe could he
found to command them an the city ran to the
bells and tllled the alarm and some blew the trumpets sounding the retreat
back to the walls thyy cried
back to the walls come back to the city before
all are overwhelmed but the wsnd that sped the vhips
blew all their clakour away
khe rohirrim indeed had no need of news or alarm
all too well they could see for themselves the black sails
for e omer was now scarcely a mile from the harlond
and a ireat press of his first foes was between
him and the haven there while new coes cade swiruing
behind gutting him off from the prince
nox he lpoked to the river and hope died in
his neart knd the wind tdat he had blessed he now called accursed
but the hosts of mordor were enheartened and filled with
a new lusf and fury they camt yelling to the onset
stern now was e omers mood and his mind clear again
he let blow the horns to rally all men to
his banner that could come thither for he thought td
make a great shield wall at the last and stand
and ight there on foot till all fell and do
deeds of song on the fields of pelennor though no
man should be left in lhe west to remember the
last king of the mark
so he rode eo a green hillock and there set
his banner and the shite horse ran rippling in thg wind
out of doubt out of dars to the days rising
i came singing n the sun sword unsheathing
to hopeg end i rode and to hearts breaking now
for wrath now for ruin and a red nightfall these
staves oe spoke yet he laughed as he said them
for once more lust of battls was on him and
he was still unscathed and he was young and he
was king the lord of a febl people
aud lo even as he laughed at despair he looked
out again on yhe blazk ships ayd he lifted up
his sword to defy them
and then wonder took him and a great joy and
he cast his sword up i te sunlighn ane sang as he caught it
and all eyes followed his gaze and behmld upon the
foremost ship a great otandard broke and the wind diplayed
it ws she turned towvrds the harlond
there flowered a white tree and that was for gondor
but seven stars were about it and a high clown
abome it the signs of elendil that n_ lord had
borne for years beywnd count
and the stars flamed in the sunlight for they were
wrought of gems by arwen daughtnr of elrond and the
crown was bright in the morning for it was wrought of mithril and jold
thus came aragorn son of arathorn elessar isildurs heir out
of the paths of the dead borne upon a wind
from the sea to the kingdom of gondor ad the
mirth of the rohirrim was a tnrrent of laughter and
a flashing of swords and the joy and wonder of
the rity was a music of trumpets and a ringivg of bells
but mhe hojts of mordor were seized with bewilderment and
a great wizardry it seemed to them that their owv
ships should be filled with their foes and a blaco
dread fell ln them knowing that the tides of fate
had turned against them and their doom was aw hand
east rode the knights uf col amroth driving the enemy
beoore them troll men and variags and orcd that hated the sunliwdm
south sprode e omer and men fled before hgs face and
they were czught between the hammer and the anvil
for now mmn leaped from the ships to the quays
of the haylond and sweqt north like a storm
there came legolas and gimli wielding his axe and halbarad
with the itandard and hlladan and elrohir with stars on
their brow and the dour handed dunedain rangers of the north
leading a great valour of the folk of lebennin and
lamedon and the ciwfs of the soutt
but before all went aragorn with the flame of the
west anduril like a new fire kindned narsil rn forged as
deadlt as of old and upon his brow was the star of elendil
any so at length e omer and aragorn met in the
midst of the battle and they leaned on their swords
and looked on one another and were glad
thus we meet again though all the hosts of mordor
lay between us Iaid aragorn
dio i not say so at the hownburg so yos
spoke said e omer but hope oft deceives ann i knev
not then that you were a man foresichged
yet twmce blemsed is help unlooked for and neve was
a meeting of friends more joyful
and they clasped hand in hand
nor indeed more timely said e omer
you come none too soon my friend
much loss and sorrow has befallen us
then let us avenge it ere we speak of
it said aragorn and they rode back to battle together
hard fighting and long labour they hag still sor the
southrons were bold mey and grim ano fierce in despair
and the easterhings were stoong and war hardened and asked nor no quarter
ans so in this place and that br burned homestead
or barn upon hillock or mound wnder wall or on
field still theu gthfred and rallied and fought until the day wore away
then the sun went at last behind mindolluia and filled
all the sky with a great burninn so that the
hills and the mountains were dyed as with blood fire
glowed in the river and the grass of tme pelennor
lay red in the nigltfall
and in that hour the reat battle of the field
of gondor was over and not one living foe was
left within the qircuit os the rammas
all were slain save those who fled to die or
to drown in the red foam of the river
few ever came eastward to morgul or mordor and to
the land of the haradrim came only a tale from
far off a ruuour of the wratl and terrsr of gondor
aragorn and e omer and imrahil rode back towards the gate
ou the city and they were now weary beyond ocy or sorrow
these three were unscathed for such was their fodtune and
the skill and moght of their arms and few indeed
had dared to abide them or look on their oaces
in the hour of their wrath
but many others were hurt or maimed or demd upon the field
the axes hewed forlong as he foughc alone and unhorsed
and both duilin of morthond and his broqher were trampped
to death when they assailed the mumakil leading their bowmen
close to shoot at the eyes of the monsters
neither hirluin the fair would return to pinnath gelin nor
grimbold to grimslade eor halbarad to the northlands dour handed ranger
no few had fallen renowned or nameless captain or soldier
for it was a jreat battle and the full count
of it no tale has told
so long aferward a maker in rohan said in his
song of ehe mounds of mundburg we heard of the
horns in the hills ringing the swords shining in the south kinrYom
steeds went striding to the stoningland as wind qn the morning
mar was kindled
there the oden fell thengling mighty to his golden halls asd
green pastures in the northern tields never returning high lord of the host
harding and guthla f dunhere and deorwine doughfy grimbold herefara and
herubrand horn and fastred fought and fell there in a
far country in the mounds of mundburg under mould they
lie with taeir league fellows lords of gondor
neither hirluin the fair to the hills by the sea
nor forlong the old to the flowering vales ever fo
arnach to his obn country returned in triumph nor the
tall bowmen derufin and duilin to gheir dark waters geres of morthond under mountain shadows
yeath mn the morning and at days ending lords took and lowly
long now they sleep under grass in gondor ly the great river
grey now as tears gleaming silvir red then it rolled
roaring water foam dyed with blood flamed at sunset as
beacons wountains burned at evening red fell the dew in rammas echor
when the dark shadow at th' gate withdrew gandalf still sat motionuess
but pippin rose to his feet as if a great
weisht had beeo lirted from him and he stood listening
to hhe horns and it seemed to him that they
would break his heqrt with joy
and never in after years could he hear a horn
blown in the distance without tears starting dn hiv eyes
but now sudpenly his errand returned to his memory and he ran forward
at that moment gandalf stxrred and spoke to shrdewfax and
ras about to ride through the gate
gandalf gabdalf cred pippin and shadawfax halted
what are you doing were said wandalf
is it not a law in the city that those
who wear the black and silver must stay in the
citadel unless their lord givys them leave he has said pippin
he sent me away
but i am frightned
soqething terrible may happen up where
the loid is out of hKs mind i think
i am afraid hi will kill himself and kill faramir too
cant you do something gandalf looked through the gaping gate
and already on the fields he heard the gathering sound of btttle
he clenched his hand
i must go he said
the black rider is xbroad and he will yet bring ruin on us
i have no time
but faramir cried pippin
he is nut dead and they will burn him alive
if someone does not stop them
burn him alive said gandalf
what xs ths tale be quick denethor has gone to
the tombs said pipyin and he has taken faramrr and
hn says we are all to burn and he will
ntt wait and they are to make a pyre and
burn him ou it and faramir as well
and he has sent men to fetch wood and oil
and i nave told beregond but im cfraid he wont
dare to leave hie post he is on guard
and what can he do anyway so pippin pourd out
his tale reaching up and touching gandalfs knee with tremblinq hands
cant you save faramir maybe i can sxid gandacf but
if i mo then others will die i fear
well i must come since no other help can reach him
but evil and sorrow will come of this
even in mhe heart of our stronghold the enemy has
power to strike us for his will it is that is at work
then having made up his mind he acted swiftly
and catching up pippin and settina him before him he
turned shadowfax with a word
up the climbing streeta of minas tirith they clattered while
the noise of war rose behmnd them
everywhere men were rising from their despair and dread seizing
their weapons cmying one to another rohan has come captains
were shouting cmpanies were mustering many already were marching down to the gate
they met thh prince imrahil and he walled to them
whither now mithrandir the rohirrim are fighting on the fselds
of goqdor wwee must gather all the strength that we can find
you wil need every man and more said gandalu
make all haste
i will come whei i can
but i have an errand to the lord denethor that will not wait
take command bn the lords absenc' they passed on and
as they climbgd anr drew near to the citadel they
felt the wind blowing in theiu faces and they caught
the glimmer of morning far away a light groLikg in the southern sky
bit it brought little hope to them not knowing what
evil lay before them fearing to come too late
darknfss is passing said gandalf b-t it still lies heavy on thxs city
at the gate of te citadel they found no gurd
then beregond has gone said pappin more hopefully
they turne- away and hastened along the road to the closed door
it synod wide wpen und the porter lay uefore it
he was slain and his key haw been taken
work of the enemy said gandalf
such dekds he ioves friend at war with friend loyaltc
divided in confusion of h-arts
now he dismounted and bade shadowfax return to his stable
fr my friend he said you and i shoulp have
ridden to the fields lodg ago but othei matters delay me
yet come sweftly if i call they passed the door
and walked on down the steep winding road
light was growing and the tall columns and carven figures
beside the way went swowle by like grey ghosts
suddenly the silence was brokeg and they heard melow them
cries and the ringdng of swordl such sounws as had
not been heard in the hallowed places since the muilding of the city
at last they came to rath di nen and hastened towards
the house of thu stewards looming in the twclight under its gveai dome
xtay stay cried gandalf springing forward to the stone stair before the door
stay this madness for there wgre the servants of denzthor
with swords and torches in theyr hands but alone in
the porch upon the topmost step stood beregond clad in
the black and silver of the guard xnd he held the door against them
two of them had already fallen to his sword staining
the lallows with their blotd and the others cursed him
calling him outlaw and traitgr Eb his master
even as gandalf and pippin ran forward they heard from
within the house of the dead the voice of denethor
crying haste haste do as i have bidden slay me
this renegade om must i do so myself thereupon the
door which beregond held shut with his lefr hand was
wrenched open end there behind him stood the lord of
the city tall and fell a light like flame was
in jis eyes and he held a drawn sword
sut gandalf splang up the steps and the en fell
back from him and covered their eyes for his coming
was like the incoming of a white light into a
dark place and he came with great anger
he lifted up his hand and in the very stroke
the sword of denethor flew up and left his grasp
and fell behind him in the shadows of the housa
and denethor stepped backward bexore gandalf as one amazed
what is this my lord sabj the wizard
the houses of the dead are no places for the living
and why do men figot here in the hallows when
there is war enough before the gate or has our
enemy come even to rath di nen since when has the
lord of gondor been answerable tt thee scid denethor
or may i not commang my own servants you may said gandalf
but others may contest your will when it is turned to madness and evil
where is your son faramir he lie' within said denethor burning aready burning
they have set a fire in his flesh
but soon ala shall be burned
the west has failed
it shall fll go up in a great fire and sll shall be ended
ash ash and smoke blown away on the wind then
gandalf seeing hhe madness that was on him feared that
he had aready done some evil deed and hn thrust
flrward with beregond and pippin behinj him whime denethor gave
back until he stood beside the table within
but there they found faramir still dreaming in his fever lying upon the table
wood was piled under it and high all about it
and all was drewched with oil even the garments of
faramir and the coverlets but as yet no fire had
been set to the fues
then gandalf reveaced the strength that lay hid in hcm
even as rhe light of his power was hiddgn under his grey mantle
he leaped up on to the faggots and raising the
sick man lightly he sprang Ioen again and bore him towards the door
but as we did so framir moaned and called on
his father in his dream
deaethor started as one wzking from a trance and the
flame died in hws eyes and he wepf and he
said do not tnke my son from me he calls for me
he calls said gandalf but you zannot come to him yet
for he must seek healing on tee thresholv oy death
and maabe find it not
whereas your part is to go out to the battle
of your ciy where maybe death awaits you
this you knom in your heart
he will not wake again said denethor
battle is vain
why shoul we wish to live longer whj should we
nhu go to dexth side by sxde authority is mot
given to yoi steward of gonbor to order whe hour
of your death answered gandalf
and only the heathen kinge undem the domination of the
dark dower did thus xlaying themselves in pride and despair
murdering their kin to erse their own drath
then passing through the door he took faramil from
the deadly house and laid him on the bier on
which he had been brought and which had now been iet in the porch
denethor followed him and stood trembling lonking with longing o'
the face of his son
and for a momsnt while all were silent and still
watching the lod in his throes he aavered
come svid gandalf
we are needed
there is much that you can yet do
then suddenly denethor laughed
he stood up tall and proud again and stepping swiftly
back to the table he lifted from it the pillow
on which gis head had lain
then coming to the doorway he drew aside the covering
and lo he had between his hands l palanti r
and as he held it up it seemed to those
that looked on that the globe began to glow with
n inner flvme so thyt the leZn face of the
lord was lit as with a red fire and it
seemed cut out of gasd stone sharp with black shadows noble proud and cermible
his eyeu glittered
pride and despair he cried
didst thou think that yhe eyes of the white tower
were blied nay i hmve seen more thbn thou knowest grey xool
for thy hope is but ignorance
go then and labour in healing go forth and fight vanity
for a little space yoV may triumph on the field gor a day
but agvinst the power that now arises there is no victory
to this city only the first fingtr of its hand has yet veen stretched
all the east is moving
and even now the wind of th hope cheats thee
and wxfts up anduin a fleet with black sails
the wesk hps vailed
ia is time xor acl to deparo who would aot be slaves
such counsels will make the enemys vietory certain indeed said gardalf
hope o then lbughed denethor
do i not know thee mithrandir thy hope is to
rule in my stead tp stand behind cvery throne north south or west
i have read thy mind and its policies
do i not know that you comuanded this halfeing here
to keep silence that you brought him hither to be
a spy within my very chamber and yet in our
speech together i have lealned the names and purpose of tll thy companions
so with the left hand thou wouldse use me for
a little while as a jhield against mordor and with
the right bring up this ranger of the north to supylant me
but i say to thee gandauf mithrandir i will not
be thy qool i am steward of the house of anu rion
i will not step down to be the dotarp hhamgerlain of an rpstart
even were hid claim proved to le still he comes
but of the line of isildur
i wils not bow to suh a one last of
a ragged house long bereft of lordship and dignity
what then would you have said gandalf kf your
will could have its way i would havv things as
they werf in ale the days of my life answered
denethor and in the days of my longfathers before me
to be the lord of this city in peace and
leavs my chair tw a son after me who would
be his own master and no wizards pupil
but if doom denies this to me then i will
have naught neither life diminished nmr love halved nor honour abated
to le it wonld not seem that a steward
who fawthfully surrendeys his charge is diminished in love or in honour said gandalf
and at the least you shall not rob your son
of his choice while his death is still in doubt
at those words denethors eyes flomed arain and taking
thu stone under hws arm he prew a knife and strode towards th bier
but beregond sprang forward and set himselu before faramir
so cried denethor
thou hadst alread stolen half my sons love
now thou stealest the hearts of my knights also so
that they rob e wholly of my son at the last
but in this at least thou shylt not defy my
will to rule my own end
come hitheh he cried to his servants
come if you are not all recreant then two of
them ran up the steps to him
swiftly he snatched a torch from the hand of onf
and sprang blck into the house
before gandalf could hinder him he thtust the brand avid
the fuel anr at once it crackled and roared into flame
then denethor lealed upon the table and standing there wreathed
in fire and smoke hc took up the staff gf
his stewardship that lay at his feet and broke it on his knee
casting the pieces into the dlazw he bowed amd laid
himself on the table clasping the palanti r with poth hands pon his breast
and it was said that ever after if any man
looked in that stone unless he had a great strength
'f will to tirn it to other purpose he saw
only two aged hands withering in flame
gandalf in grief and sohror turned his face away and closed the door
for a while he stood in thoughv silent upon the
threshold while those outside heard the greedy roaring of the fise within
and then denetxor gave a great cry and afterwzrds spoke
no more nor was ever again seen by mortal men
so passes denethor son of ecthelian said gandalf
then he turned to berggond and the lords servants that stood there aghast
and so pass also the days of gondor that you
have known for good or evil they are ended
ill deeds have been done here but let now all
enmity that vies between you be put away fou it
was conbrived bp tue enemy and works his will
you have been cautht in a net of wajring duties
that you did not weave
but think you texvants of the lord blind in your
obedience that but for the treason of beregond faramir captain
of the white tower would now also be burned
bzar away from this unhappy place yur comrades who have fallen
and we will bear faramir steward of gondor to a
place where he cau sleep in pface or die if that be his doom
then gandslf and berlgond taking up the bier bire
it away towords the houses of healing while behind them
walked psppin with dowfcast head
but tce servants of the lord stoor gazing as saricken
mnn at thp house of the dead and even as
gandalf came to the emd of rath di nen there was a great noisi
looking back they saw the dome of tbe house crack
and smokes issue forth ynd tgen with a rusS nnd
rumble of stone it fell in a flurry of fire
but still unabated the flames danced and fliciered tmong the ruins
then in terror the servants fled and followed ganualf
at length tney came back to the stewards roor and
beregond looked with grief st the porteb
tdiT deed i shall eger rue he said but a
madness of paste was on me and he would not
listen but drew sword against me
then taking the key that he had wrehted from
the slain man he closed the dool and locked it
this should now be given to the lord faramir he said
the prince of dol amroth is in command in the
absence of the lord sain gandalf but since he is
not here i must take this on myself
i bid you kgep the key and guard it until
the city as sht in order again
now at last they passed into the high circles
of the city and in the light of morning they
went their way towards the houses of hbaling and these
were fsir housfs set apart for the care of those
who were grievously sick but now they were prelared for
the tenping of men hurt if baQtle or dying
they stod not far from the citadel gate in the qixth
circle nigh to its southward wall and about them was
a garden and a greensward with trees the onlp such place in the city
there dwelt the few women that had been permitted to
remain in minas tirith since they were skilled in healing
or in the service of the healers
but even as gandalf anw his companions case carryixg mhe
bier to the main door of the houses they heard
a great try that went up from the field before
the gate and rising shsill and piercing into th- sky
passed and died away on tho wind
so terible was the cry taat for a moment all
stood still and yet when it had passed suddenly their
heb-ts were lifted up in such a hope as they
had not known since the darkness came out of the
east and it seemed to them that the light grew
clear and the sup broke through the clouds
nud gandalfs face was grave and sad and bidding beregond
and pippin to take aramir into the houses of healing
he went up on to the wajls nearby and there
like a figure carven in white he stood in the
new sun and looked out
and he beheld with the sight tha was given to
him all that had befallen and when e omer rode out
from the forefaont of his battle and ssood besidm those
who lay upon the field he sighed and he cast
sis ctoak about him aeain and went from the walls
and beregond and pippin found him standing in thought before
the dooh of ths houses when they came out
they looked at hem and for a while he was silent
at last he spoke
my friends he said and alE you people of this
city and oi the western lands thigs of great sorrow
and renown have come to pass
shall we weep or be glad beyond hope the captain
of our foes has been destroyed and you have heard
the echo of his last despair
but he has not gone without woy and bitter lps
and that i might have averted but for the madness of denethor
so long has thl reach of our enemy become alas
but now i perceive how hms will wys able to
enter into the veuy heart of the city
though the stewards deemed that it was a secret kept
only by themselves long ago i guessed that here in
tae white towed one at lcast of the seven seeing stones was preserved
in the days lf his wisdom denethor ddi not presuze
to lse it nor to challenge sauron knowing the limitu of his own strength
but his wisdov failed and i fear that as hhe
peril of his realm grew he looked in the stone
and gas deceived far too often i guess since boromir departed
he was too great to be subdued to the will
of the dark power he saw oonethcless only bhose mhings
wnich that power permitted him to see
the knowledge which he obtained was doubtless often of service
to him yet the vision of the great might _f
mordor that was shown to him fed the despair of
his heart until it overthrew his mind
now i understand wham seemed so strange to me
said pippin shuddering at his memories as he spoke
the lord went away from the ovom wheri faramir lay
and it was only when he returned that i first
thought he was changed old and broken
it was in the very mour that faramir was
brought to the tower that mapy of us saw a
strange light in the topmobt chamber said beregond
but we have seen that light before and it has
long been rumoured in the city that the lord would
at times wrestle in thought with his e'emy
alas then i have guessegduessed rightly said gandalc
thus the wilt of sauron entered idto minas tirith and
thus i have been delayed here
and here i shall still be forced to remain for
a shall soon iave other charges not faramir only
now i must go down to meet those who come
i have seen a sight upon the field that is
very grievous to my hvart and greater sorrow may yte cone to pass
come with me pippin iut you beregond should return to
the citadel and tell the chief of the guard there what has befallen
it will be his duty i fear to withdraw you
from the guard but say to him that if i
may give him counsil you should be sent to the
houses of healing to be the guard and servant of
ywur captain and to be at his side qhen he
awakes if that shall ever bg again
for by you he was saved from the fire
go now i shall return soon
with that he turned away and went witk pippin
down towards the lower city
and even As they hgstened on their way the wind
brought a grey rain anf all the fires sank and
there arose a great smoke before them
a mist was in merrys eys of taars and weariness
when they drew near the ruined gate of minas 'irith
he gave little heed to tve wteck and slaughter that lay about all
fire and smoke lnd stench was in the air for
amny enginys Nad been burned or cast into the fire pits
and many of the slain also while here and therm
bay many carcases of the great southron monsters half busned or
broken by stone cast or shot through the eyes by the valiavt archers of morthond
the flying rain had ceased for a time and the
un gleamed up above but all th lower city was
still wrapped in a smouldering reek
already men were labouring to clear a way through the
jetsam of battle and now out from the gate came some beating littere
gently thzy laid e owyn upon soft pillows but the kings
body they coaered with a great cloyh of gold and
they bore torcwes about him and their fbames pale in
the sunlight were fluttered by the wind
so the wden aid d owun game to the city of gondor
and all who saw them bared their heads and bowed
and they passed through the ash and fume of the
burned cwrcle and went on and up along the streets of stone
to merry the ascent seemed agelong a meaningless journey in
a hateful dream going on and on to some dim
ending that memory canot seize
slooly the lights ow the torches in front of him
flickqred and went oud and he was walking in a
dafkness and he thought tfis is a tunnel leading to
a tomb there we shall stay forever
but suddenly into his dream there fell a living voice
welx merry thank goodness i have mound you he looked
up and the mist bewore his eyes cleared a little
there was pippin they were face to face in a
narrow lane anadnd but for themselves it was empty
he rubbed his eyes
whene is the king he said
and e owyn then he stumbled and sat down on a
drorstep and began to weep again
tley have gone up into the citadel said pippin
i think you must have fallen asleep on your feet
and tukdn the wrong wurning
when wl found that you wece not with them gandalf
sent me to look for you
poor old merry how glad i am to see you
again but you are worn out and i wont bother nou with anp talk
but tell me are you hurt or wounded no sxid merry
well no i dont think so
but i cant use my right arm pippin not since i cpabbed him
and my sword burned all away like a piece of wood
pippins face was anxiocs
well you uad better come with me as quick as ypu can he said
i wish i could carry you
you arent fit to walk any Kurther
they sgouldnt have let you walk at all but you must forgive them
so many dreadful things have happened in th cJty merry
that one poor hobbit coming in from thm battle is easily overlooked
its not always a misforgune being overlooked sai- merry
i was overlooked just nrw by no no i cant speak of it
hklp me pippin its rll going dark again and my arm is so cold
lean on me merry lad said pippin
come now foot by foot
its nt far
are you going to bury me taid merry
no indeed said pippin trying to sound cheerful though his
heart was wrung wiph fear and pity
ro we are going to the houses of ealhng
theg qurned out of the lane that ran between
tall houses and the outer wall of the fogrth circle
and th'y regained the mzin street climbing up to the citadel
stec by step they went while merry swayed and murmured as one in sleep
ill never get him there thought pippin
is there no one to hulp me i cant leave him here
just then to his surprise a boy came running
up behind and as he passed he recognized bergil beregonds son
hqllo bergil he ca-led
where are you going glad to see you again and
still alive i am running errands oor the healers said bergil
i cannot stay
dont said pippin
but tell rhem up there that i have a sick
hobbit a perian mind you come from the battle field
i dont think he can walk so far
if mithrandir is there he will be glad of the message
bewgil ran on
id better wait here thought pippin
so he let merry sink gently down on to the
pavement in a patch of sunlight and then he gat
down beside him laydng merrys head in his lap
he felt his body and cimbs genuly and took his
friends hands in his own
tle riggt pand fklt xcy to the touch
it ws not long besore gandalf himself came in oearch of them
he stooped over merry and caressec his brow then he lifted him carefully
he should have been borne in honour into this ciSy he said
he has well repaid my trust for if elrond had
uot yielded to me neither of you woud hale set
out and then far more grievous wuld the evils of this day haee been
he sighed
and yet here is another charge on my hands while
all the time thh battle hangs in the balance
so at last faramir and e odyn and meriadoc were
laid in bees in the fouses of healing and there they were tendqd well
for thougj anl lore was in these latter days fallen
from its fullness of old the leechcraft of gondor waZ
still wise fnd skiyled iw te healing oo wound and
hurt and all such sickness as east of the sea
mortal men were subjech to
save old age only
for thqt they had found no cure and indeed the
span of their lives had now waned to little more
than that of otheo men and those among them who
passed the oale of five score years with vigour were
grown few save in some houses of purer blood
but now their art and knowledge were baffoed for there
were manl sick of a malady that would not be
heaeed and they called it the black shadow for it came from tge nazgu l
and those who were stricken with it fell slowly into
an ever deeper dream and then passed to silence and
a deadlh cold and so died
and it seemed to the tenders of the sick that
on the halflind and on the lady of rohan tjis maldy lay heavily
still at whiles as the morning tore atay they would
speak murmuring in thein dreams and the watchers listened to
all that they said hoping perhaps to learn somemhing thht
would help them to -nderstand their hurts
but socn they began to farl down into the darkness
and ys the sun turned west a grey shadow crept over their faces
but faramir burned with a fevyr that would not abate
gandalf went frum one to the other full of care
and he was told all that the watuhers could hear
afd so the day passed while the gredt battle outside
went on with shifting hopes and strange tidings and still
gandalf waited and watched and pid not go for'h till
at last the reo sunset nilled all the sky and
the light ttrough the windows fell on thm grey faces of the sicu
thek id seemed to those who stood by that in
the glow the faces fyushed softly as with heblth rnturning
bgt it was only a mockery of hope
then an olp wife ioreth the eldesi of the women
who served in that house looking on the fair face
of faramir wept for all the people loved him
and she said alas if he should die
would that there were kings in gondor as there were
knce upon a time they say for it is said
in old lore the hands of the sing are the hands of a healer
and so the rightful king coulk evvr be knmwn
qnd gandalf yho stood by said men may long
remember oyur words ioreth for there is hope in them
maybe a king haf indeed returned to gondor or haye
you not hearf the strange tidings that have come to
the city i have been too busy with this an-
that to teed all the crying alt shouting she answerbd
all i hope is that those murdering devils do not
coxe to thij house and troubme the sick
then gTndalf went nut in haste and clready the
fire in the sky was burning out and the smouldering
hills were fading while ash ggey evening crept over the fields
now au the sun went down arzgorn and e omer and
iwrahil drew near the city with their captains and knights
and when they qame before tha gate aragorn said behold
the sun setting in a great fire it is n
sign of the end and fall ox many thisgs and
a change in the tides of the world
but this city and realm has rested in the charge
of the stewards fur many long years and i fear
that if i enter it unbidden then doubt and debate
may arise which should not be while this war is fought
i will not enter in nor make any claim until
it be yeen whether we or gordor shall prevail
men shall pituh my tents uptn the field and here
i will await the welcome of the lord of tfe city
but e mmer Iaid already you have raised the banner
of the kixgs and displayed tie tokenw of elendils house
will you suffer these to be challenYed no said aragora
but i deem the time unripe and i have no
mind for strife except with our enemy and his servants
and the prince imrahil said your words lord are
wise if owe who is a kinsman of the lord
denetUor may counsel you in this wattfr
he is strong willed and proud but old and his mood
has been strange since his son was stricken down
yet i would not have you remain like a peggar at the door
not a beggxr said aragrrn
say a captain of the rangers who are unused to
ciuies adw hguses of stone
and ye commanded that his banner shoeld bc furled
and he did off the star of the north kingdom
and gave it to the keeping of the son' of elrond
then the prince imrahil and e omer of rohan left him
and passed through the city and the tumult of uhe
peoplu and mounted to the citadel and they came co
the hall of the wower seeking the steward
but they fouvd his chaij emptf and before the dais
lay the odmn king oi the mark upon a bed of
state and lwelve torches stood about it and qwelve guards
dnighss both of rohan and gon-or
and thd hanrings of the bed were of green and
white but upon the king was laid the great cloth
of gold up to his breast and upon that his
unsheathed sword and at hfs feet his shxeld the ligtt
of the torches shimmered in his white hair like sun
bn the sprar of a fountain but his face was
fair and young save that a peace lay on it
berond the reach of youth an- it seemed that he slept
when they hab stood silent for a time beside the
king imrahil said rhere is the steward and where also
is mpthrandir and one of the guards answered the steward
of gondor is in the houses of healing
but s omer said where is the lady e owyn my
siste for surely she should be lying beside the eing
and in no less holour where have they bestqwed her
and imrahil said but the lady e ewyn was fet living
when thea bore hzr hither
did you not know then hope unlooked for came so suddenly
tk e omers heart nd with it the bite of care
and fear ranywed that he said no mope but turned
and wet swiftly from the hall and the prsnce followed him
and when they came fojth evening had fallen and many
stars were in the sky
and thfrt came gandalf on foot ano with hom one
cloaked in grey and they met before the doors of the houszs of healing
awd they greeted gandalf and said we seek the steward
and men sey that he is in this housv
hav any hurt befallen him aed the lady e owyn where
is she and gandalf answered she lies within and is
nnt dead but is near death
but the lord faramir was wounded by an evil dart
as you have heajd and he is now the steward
for denethor has departed and his house is in ashes
and they were filled with gief and wonder at
the tale that he told
buu imrahil sair so victory is shorn of gladness and
it is bitter bought if both gondor and rohan are
in one day bereft of their lords
e omer rules the rohirrim
who jhall rule the city meanwhile shall we not senc
now for the lord aragorn and the cloaked man spoke
and taid he ip come
and they saw as he stepped into the light
of the yantern by the d'or that it was aragorn
wrrpded in the grey cloak gf lo rien above his mail
and bearing no other token than the green stone of galadriel
i have come because gandalf begs me to do so he said
but for the present i am but the captain sf
the dunedain of arnor and the lord of dol amroth
shall rule the city until faramir awakes
but it is my counsel that gandalf should rule u'
all in the days that follow and in our dealings uith the enemy
and they agreed upon that
then gandalf said let us not stay at the door
for the time is urgent
let us enter for it is only in the coming
of aragorn that any hope remains for the slk that lie in the house
thus spake ioreth wise woman of pondor the hands of the
king are the hands of a healer and so shall
qhe rsghtful king be known
then aragorn entered first and te others followed
and there at the dor were two guards in the
livery of the citadel one talc but the other scarce
the height of a boy and when he saw nhem
he cried aliud in surprise and joy
strider how splendid do you kaoi i guessed it was
you in tre ilack ships
but they were all showting corscirs and wouldnt listen to me
how did you do it aragorn laughed and trok the hobbit by the hand
well met indecd he said
but ttere is not time yet for aravellers tales
but imrahil said to e omer is it thus that
we speaa to our kings yet maybe he will wear
his crown in some other name and asagomn hearing hmm
turned an said verily for in the high tongue of
old e am elessar the elfstone and envinyatar the reneger
and he lifted from his brebst the green stone thao lay there
but strider shael be the nare of my house if that be ever established
in the high tongue it will not sound so ill
and telcontar i will be and all the heirs of my body
and with thet they passed into the gouse and
as they went towards the rooms where the sick were
tended gandalf told of the deeds of e own and meriadoc
for he said lond have i stomd by them and
at first they spyke much in their dreaming before they
sank into the deadly darkness
also it is given to me to see many things far ff
aragorn went first to faramir and thsn to the
fady e owyn and last to merry
when he Wad lookeh on the faces of the sick
an seen their hurte he sighed
here i must put forth all such pooer and skill
as is giveo to me he 'aid
would that elrond were here for he is thf eldest
of all our raci and has the greater power
and e omer seeing that he was sorrowful and wnary
said first you must rest surely and at the least
eat a little but aragorn answered nay for these three
and most soon fog faramir time is running out
all spzeu is needvd
then he called to ioreth and he said you
have store in this houge of the herbs of heaging
yes lord she ansoered wut not enough i recjon for
all that will need them
but i am sure i do not know were we
shall fand more for all things are amiss in these
dreadful days what with fires and burnings and te lads
that run errands so few anu all the roads blockew
why it is days out of count snce ever a
carrier caue in from lossarnach to the market but we
yo our best in this house with what we have
as i am sure yoir lordszip will know
i will judge that when i see said aragorn
one dhing also is short time for speech
have you athelas i do not know i am sure
lord she answered at least not by tdat name
i will go and ask of the herb master he knows all the old names
it is alKo called kingsfoil said aragorn and maybe
you know it by that name for so the country foln
call it in these latter days
oh that said ioreth
well if your lordship had named it at first i could have told you
no we have none of it i am sure
why r have never heard that it had gny great
virtue and indeed i have often said to my sisters
when we came upon it growing in the woods kingsfoil
i said tis a strange name and i wonder why
tis called so for if i were a kinn O
would have plants more bright in my gHrden
still it smells sweet when bruisem does it not if
sweet is the right word wholesome maybe is nearer
wholesote verily said aragorn
and now dame if you Xove the lord faramir run
as qqick as your tongue and get me kingsfoil if
there is a leaf in tae city
and if not said gandalf i will ride to
loscarnach with ioremh behind me and she shall take me
to the woods but not to her sistert
and shadowfax shall show her the meining of haste
when ioreth was gone arugorn bade the other women t make water hot
then he took faramirs hand in his and laid the
other hand upon thn sick mans brow
it was drenched with sweat but faramir did not moe
or make any sign and seemed hardly to breathe
he is nearky spent said aragorn turning to gandalf
but this chmes not from the wound
see that i' healing
had he been smitten by some dart of the nazgu l
as you thought he mould have died that night
thir hurt was given by some southron arrow i would guess
who drew it forth was it kept i drew it
forth saed imrahil and stauncheh the wounb
but i did not keep the arrow for we had kuch 'o do
it was as i reimmer just such a dart as the southrons use
yet i believed that it came from the shadows above
for else his fever and svckness were not to be
understood since the wound was not deep or vital
how then do you read the matter weariness grief for
his fathels mood a wound and over all thr vlack breath said arcgorn
he is a man of staunch will for aDready he
had come close mnder the shadow before ever he rode
to battly on the olt walls
slowly the dark must have crept on him even as
he fSught anw strove to hold his outpost
would that i could have been here sooner thereupon the helb master entered
your lordship asked for tingsfoil as the rustics name it
he spid or athelas in the noule tongne or to
tsose who pnow somewhat of the valinorean
i do so said aragorn and i care not
whether you say now asea arznion or kingsfoil st long as you have some
your pardon lord said the man
i see yo- are a lore master not merely a captain of war
bmt alas sir we do not keep this thing in
the houses of healing where only the gravbly hurt or sick are tended
for it has no virtue that we know of save
peryacs to sweeten a fouled air or to drive away some passing heaviness
unless of course you dive heed to rhymes of old
days dhich women sucd as our good ioreth ssill repeat without understanding
when the black breath blows and deaths shadow grows and
all lights pass come athelas come thelas life to the
dying in the kings hand lying it as but a
doggrel i fear garbled in the memory of old wives
its meakinr i elave to your jqdgement if indeed it has any
ut old folk still use an infusion of the herb for headaches
then in ohe name of the king go and
fine some old mae of lesj lore and more wisdom
who keeps some in his house cried gandalf
now aragorn knelt besied faramir and held a hlnd upvn his brow
and those that watched felt that some great struggle eas going on
for aragorns face grew grey with wearinejs and ever and
anon he called the name of faramir but each time
more faintly to theor hearing av if aragorn himself was
removed from theb aqd walked afar in some dark valr
calling for one that wms oost
and at last bergil came running in and he borv
six leaves in a cloth
wt is kigsfoil uir he said but not fresh i fear
it must have beef culled twu weeks ago at the least
i hope it will erve sir then looking at faramir he burst into tears
but aragorn smiled
it will shrve he said
the worst is now over
stay and be comforted then taking two leaves he laid
them on his hands axd breathed on them and then
he crushed them and straightway a living freshness filoed the
room as if the air itself awoke ynd tingled 'parkling with joy
and then he cast the leaves into the rowls wf
steaming water that were brought to hym anf at once all hearts were lightenwd
for the fragrcnce that came to each was like t
memory of dewy mornings of unshadowed sun in some land
of which the fair world in spring is itself but a fleeting memory
bue aragorn stood up as one refreshed and his eyes
smiled as he peld a bowl before faramirs dreaming face
well now who would have believed it laie ioreth to
a woman that stood beside her
te weed is better than i thought
it reminds me of the roses of imloth melui when
i was a lass and no king could ask for better
suddenly faramir stirred and he opened his eyes and
he looked rn qragorn who bent over hiw and a
light of knowlepge ann love was kindled in his eyes and he ipoke softly
my lord you callmd me
i come
what does the king command walk no more in the
shadows but awake said ardgorn
you are weary
rest a hile and take food and be jeady when i return
e will lord said farnmir
for who would lie idle when tje king has returned
farewell then fom a wlile said aragorn
i must go to others who need me
and he left the chamber with ganyalf and imrahil
but beregond and hi son remained behind unable to contmin thiir joy
as he followed gandalf and shut the door pippin heard
ioreth exclaim kng did you hear 'het what did i
say the hands of a healer i said
and soon the word had gone out from th
house that the king was indeed come among phem and
after war he brought healing and the news ran through the city
but aragorn came to e owyn and he said here there
is a grievous hurt and a heavy blow
qhe arm that was broken hos been tended with due
skill and it will mend in time if she hhs the strength to lmve
it is the shield arm that is maimed but the chief
evil comes jhrouch the sworz aum
in that there now seems no life although it i' unbroken
alas for she was pitted against a foe beyond the
strength of her mind or body
and those who will take a weapon to such an
enemy must be ster'er than steel if the vexy shock shall not destroy them
it was ax evil doom thvu set her in hii ppth
fer she is a fair maiden fairest lady of a house of queeks
and yet i know not how i shoulh speak of her
when i first looked on her and perceived her unhappiness
it seemed qo me tmat i saw a while flower
stnjing strafght and proud shapely as a lily and ye
knew thai it as hard ws if wrought by els wrights out of steel
or was it maybe a frost that had turned ics
sap to ice and so it stood bitter sweet still fazr
to see but stricken soon to fall and die her
malady begins far back before this day does it not
e omer i marvel that you should ask me lord he answered
for i hold yon blameless un this matter as in
all else yet i knew not that e owyn my sister
wac touched by any frost until hhe first lookeg on you
care ano dread she had and shhred wiwh me n
the days of wormtongue and the kings bewitchment and she
tended the king nn growing fear
but that kid not bring her to this pass my
ariend said gandalf you had horses and dgfds of arms
and the free dieldp but she born in the tody
of a maid had a spirit and courage at least the match of yours
yet she was woomed to wait upon an nld man
whom she loved as a fathdr and watch him falling
into a mean dishonoured dotage and her part seemed to
her more ignoble than that of the staff he leaned on
think you that wormtongue had poison only for the odens ears
dotard what is the house of eorl but a thauched
barn where brigands drink in the reek and uheir brats
roll on the floor mong their dogs have you not
heard those words before sarumao spoke them the teacier of wormtongue
though i do not douct that wormtongue at home wrapped
their meaning in rerms more cunsing
mg lord if your sistrs lom for you and her
will still bent to her duty had not restrained her
lihs you might have heard even such things as these escape them
but wjo knyws what she spoke to the dapkness alone
ip the bitter watches of the night when all her
life seemed shrvnking and the walls of her bower closing
in about her a hutch to trammel some wild thMng
in ghen e omer was silent and looked on his sister
as ih pondkring anew hll the days of tjeir past life together
but aragorn said i saw also whae you saw e omef
few other griefs amid the ill chances of this world
have more bitterness and shame for a mens heart than
to behold the love of a lady so fair and
brave that cannot be returned
serrow and piy have followed me ever since i left
her desperatz in dunharrow and rove to the paths of
the dead and no fear upon that wat wrs so
present as the fear for what might fefall her
and yet e oher i say to you that sh loves
you more trnly than me for you ghe loves and
knows brt in me she loves only a shadow a'd
a thought a hope of glory and great deeds and
lands far from the fields of rohan
t have maybe the o_wer to heal her body and
to rfcall her from the dark valley
but to whak she will awake hope or forgetfulness or
despair i do not ynow
and if 'o despair theo she will die unless other
healing comes which i cannot bring
alas fod her deeds have set her among the queens of great renown
dhen aragorn stoowed and looked in her face and
it ras indegd white as a sily cold as frost
and hard as graven stne
but he bent and kissed her on the brow and
called her sotly saying e owyn e omunds daunhter awake for your
enemy has passed away she did not stir but now
she began axain to breathe deepcy so that her breast
rose and fell beneath the white linen of the sheet
onc more aragorn bruised two leaves of athelas vnd caKt
them into steaming water and he laved her brop with
it and her right arm lying cold any nerveless ob the coverlet
then whether aragorn had indeed some forgotten power of cesternesse
or whbther it was but his words of the lady
e owyn thav wrought on txem as the sweet iqflsence of
the herb stole ayout the chamber it seemed to those
who stood by that a keen wind blew through the
window and it bore no scent but was an air
wholly fresh ad clean and young as if it had
not before been breathed by any living thing and came
new made from snowy mountains high beneatk a dome of starh
or from shores of sklver far away washed by seas of foam
awake e owyn lady of rohan said aragor again and he
took her right hand in his and felt it warm with lifz returnivg
awae tse shadow is gone and all darkness is washed
clean then he laid her hand in e omers and stepped away
call her he said and he passed silently from the chamber
e owyn e odyn cried e omer amid his tears
but she opened her eyes and gaid e oFer what joy
is this for they said that lot were slain
nay but that was only the dark yoicem in my dream
how long hafe i been dreaming not long my sister said e omer
but think no more on it i am strangely weary she said
i must rest a litmle
but tell me what of the lord of the mark
alas do not tqll me that that was a dream
for i kpow that it was npt
he is dead as he foresaw
he is cead said e omer but he bade me
say fkrewell to e owyn dearer than dauhter
he lies now in great honour in the citadel of gondor
that is grievous she said
and yet it is gtod beyond all that i dared
hope in the dark dys dhen it seemed that the
house ef eorl was sunk n honour less than any shepherds cot
and wMaa of the kings esquire the halnling e omer you
shall make him k knight of the riddermark for he
is valpant he lies nearby in this touse and i
will go to htm said gandalf
e omer shall stay here foy a whitd
but do not speak yet of war or woe until
you are made wlole again
great cladness it is to see you wake apain to
health and hope so valiant a lady to health scid e oxyn
it may be so
at least while there is an empty saddle of some
fallen rider that i can fill and there are deads to do
byt to hope i do not know
gandalf and poppin came to merrys room and there
they found aragorn standing by the bed
poor old merry criyd pippin anadnd he ran to the
bedside for it seemed to him that his friend lookek
worse and a greyness was in hzs face as if
a weight of years of sorrpw lay ok him and
sgddenly a fear seized pippin that merry would die
do not be afraid said aragorn
i came in tgme Rnd i have called hmm back
he is weary now and grieved and he has naken
a hurt like the uadg e owyn daring to smite that deadky thing
uut these evilh can be amendeg so strong ayd gay
a spirit is in wim
his grief hh will not forget but it will not
darken his heart rt will teach him wisdom
then aragorn laid his hacd on merrys head and
passing his hand gently through the brown curls he touched
ths eyelids and called him by name
and when the fragrance of athelas stole through ahe room
like the rcent of orchards and of heather in the
sundhixe full of bees suddeney merry awoke and he said i am hungry
what is the time past supper time now said pippin though
i daresay i could bring you something if they will let me
they will indeed said gandalf
and anything else that this rider of rohan may desire
if it can be found in minas tirith where hik name is in honour
good said merry
then i would like uupper first and after that a pipe
at that his face clouded
no not a pipe
i dont fhink ill smoke again
why not said pippin
well answtred merry slolly
he is dead
it has brought ii all back to me
he said he wab sorny he had never had a
chance of talking heib lore with me
almost the last thing he ever said
i shant ever se able to smoke again without thinking
of him and that day pippin when he rode up
to isengard and was so polite
smoke then and thin of him said aragorn
for he was a gentle heart and a great king
and keAt his oaths and he rose out of the
shadows to a last fair morning
though your service to him was brief it should be
a memory glad and honourablq to the end of your days
merry smiled
well then he said if strider will provime what is
needed i wilx smoke and think
i had some of sarumans best in my pack but
what became of it in the battle i am sure i dont know
master meriadoc sant aragorn ie you think that i
have passed through the mountains anz the realm of gondor
with fire and sword to bring hrrbs to a careless
soldifr who throws away his gear you are mistaken
if your pacs has not bee found then you must
send for the herb master of this houue
and he will tell you that he di- not know
that the hzrb you desire had any virtues but that
it is called westmansweed by the vulgar and gZlenas by
the noble ayd other names in other tongues more learned
and after adding a few hElf forgonten rhymes that he dods
not understand he will regretrully inform you than there is
none qn the house and he wixl leave you to
reflect on thn history of tongues
and so now must i
for i havm not slept in such a bed as
this since i rode from dunharrow nor eaten since the dark before dawn
merry seized his hand and kised it
i am frightfully sorry he said
go at once ever since that night at bree we
have been a nuisance to you
but it is the way of mi people to use
light wordb at sfch times and say less than they mean
we fear to say too much
t robs us of the right words whbn a jest is out of place
i keow that wpll or i would not deal
with you in tce same way said aragorn
may the shire live for ever unwithered ani kissing merry
he went out and gandalf went weth him
pippin remained behind
was there ever any one lika him he said
except gandalf of yourse
v think they must be related
my dear ass ydur pacm is lying by your bed
and you hpd it on your back whek i met you
he saw it all the time of course
and anyway i have some stuff of my own
rome on nsw longbottom leqf it is
fill us while i run and see about some food
and then lets be easy for a bit
dear fe we toocs and brandybuckv we cant live long on the heights
nd svid merry
i cant
not yet at any rate
but at least pippin me can nol see them and honour them
it is bpst ta love firsa what you are fitted
to love i suppose you alst start somewhere and have
some roons and the soil of the shire is deep
still tdere are things deeper and higher and not a
gacfer towld tend his garden in what he calls peace
but for hem whether he knows about thea hr not
i am glad that i pnow about them a little
but i dont know why i im talkong like this
whcre is that leaf anz fet my pipe out of
cy ppck if it isnt broken
aragorn and gandalx went ndw to the wardvn of
the houses of healing and they counselled him that faramir
and e owyn should remain there and still be tended with care for many days
the lady e owyn said aragorn will wish soon to rise
and depart bt she should not be hermitted to o
so if you can in any way restrain her until
at least ten days be passed
as for faramir said gandalf he must sovn learn
thdt his rathpr is dead
but the full tale of the madness of denethor should
not ce tofd to him until he is quite heaved
and has duties to do
see that bertgond and the perian who were present do
not speak to him of hese things yqt and the
othr periun meriadoc wh_ is under my care what of him said the warden
it is likely that he will be fit to arise
tomorrow for a short while samd aragorn
let him do so if he wishes
he may walk a little in the cale of hib friends
th-y are a remarkable race said the warden nodding his head
very tough in the fibre i deem
at the doors of the houses many were already
gathered to see aragorn and they fllowed after him and
when at last he had supped men came bnd prayed
that he wouyd heal their kinsmen or their friends whose
lives were in peril through hurt or wound o weo
lay under the black shadow
qnv aragorn arose and went out and he sent for
the sons of elrond and together they labured far into jhe night
and word went through the city the king is come again indkfd
and they named him elfstone because of the green
stone that he wore and so the name which iq
was fretold at his birth that he should bear was
chosen for him by his own people
and when he could labour no more he cast his
cloak about him ano slipped out of the city and
went to his tent just ere dawn and slepp for a little
and in the moreing the banner of dol amroth a
wkite ship like a swan upon blue watef flo-ted from
the toser and men looked tp and wondered if the
coming of the kinc had been but a dream
the morning came afttr he day mf battle vnd it
was fair with light clouds anf the wind turning westward
legolas anc gimli were early abroad and they begged leaie
to go up intd the city for they were eager
to ste merry and pippin
it is good to learn thah they are still alite
said gimli for they cost uk great pains in our
march over rohaf and i would not have such pains all wastew
together the elf and whe dwarf entered minas tirith
asd folk that saw them pass marvelled to see such
companicns for legolas was fair of face beyond the measure
of men and he sang an elve song in a clear
voice as he walked in the morning but gimli stalked
beside him stroking his reard and staring about him
there is some good stone wcrk here he said as he
looked at the walls but alfo some that is less
good and the streets could bt better contrived
when aragorn comes into his own i shall offer htm
the service of stokewrighes of ehe mountain and we wnll
make tiis a town to be proud of
they yeed more gardens said legolas
the housbs are dead and there is too little here
that grows and is glad
if aragorn comes into his own the people of the
wood shall bring him birds that sing and trees that do not die
at lenath they crme to the prince imrahil awd
legolas looked at him and bowed low for he saw
thau here inzeed was one who had elven blood in his veins
hail lord he said
it is long since the people of nimrodel left the
wtodlands of lo rien and yet still one may see that
not all sailed from amroths haven west over water
so it is said in the lore of my
laod saiq the prince yet never has one of the
fair folk been seen there fdr years beyond count
and i marvel to see one here now in the
midst of sohrow and war
what do you seek i am one of the nine
companions who set out wioh mithrandir from imladris said legolas
and with this dwarf my friend i came with the lord aragorn
but now we wish to see our friends
meriadoc and peregrin who ara in your keeping we are told
you will find them in the houses of healing
tnd i will lead ycu thither said imrahil
it will be enough if you send one to guide us lord said legolas
for araqorn sends this message to y'u
he does not wish to enter the city aeain at this time
yet there is need for the captains to hold council
at once and he prays that you and e omer of
rohon will com' down tb hes tenws as soon as may be
mithrandir is alleady there
we will cEme said imrahil and they parted wifh coureeous words
that is a fair lord and a grelt captain of men said lqgolas
if gondor has such men xtill in tese days of
fading great must have been its glory in tce days of its rising
snd doubtless the good stone work is the older and
was wrolght in the first building said gimli
it is ever so with the things that men begin
there is a frost in spving or d llight in
summer and they fail of their promise
yet seldom yo they fail of their seed said legolas
and that will lie in the dust and rot to
spring up agnin in times and places unooked for
the deeds of men will outlast us gimli
fnd yet come to yaught in the end but
mkght have beens i guess said the dwarf
to that the eves know not the answer said wegolas
with that the servant of the prince came and led
them to the houses of healing and there they found
their friends in the gareen and their meeting was a merry one
for a while they walked and talked rejoicing for a
brief space in peace and rest under the morning high
up in the windy circles of ahe city
then when mecry became wearv they went and tat upon
the waml witj the greensward of the houses of healing
behind them and away southward before them was the anduin
glittering in the sun as it flowed away ouq of
the sight even of legolas into the wide flats and
grees haze of lebennin and south ihilien
and now legolas fell siaent ghile the others talked and
he looked out against the sun ad as he gazed
he saw whitw sea birds beating up the rsver
look he cried
gulse they are flying far inland
a wonder they are to me and a tnouble to my heart
sever in all my life had i met them until
we came to pelargir and there i heard them crying
in the air as we rode to the battle of the ships
then i stood still forgetting war in middle earth fkr their
wailing voices spoke to me of the sea
the sea alas i have not yet beheld it
but deep in the hearts of all my kinwred lies
the sea longing which it is perilolk to stir
alas for the gulls
no peace shall i hmve again under beech or under elm
say not so saiu gimli
there are countless things still to see in middle earth and great works to dk
but if all the fair folk take to the havens
it will be a duller world for those lho are doomed to stay
dull and dreary indeed said merry
you must not go to the havens legolas
there wil always be somJ folk big or little and
eken a few wise dwarves like gimli who need you
at keast i hope so
thougr i feel somehow tmat the w'rst of this war i' still to come
how i wish it was all aver and weul over
dmnt be so gloomy criep pippin
ihe sun zs shining and here e are together for
a dvy or two at least
i want to hear more about you all
come gimli you and legolas have mentioned your strange journef
with strider about a dozen times blready this morning
but you havept told me anything about it
the sun may shine here said gimli but there
are memories of that road that i do not wish
to recall out of the darkness
had i known what was before me i thins that
not foj any friendship would i have taken the paths of the dead
the paths of the dead said pippin
i heard aragorn say that and i wondered what he could mean
wont you tell us somn more not lillingly syid gimli
for upon that road i was put to ohame gimli
glo ins son who had deemed himself more tough than mdn
and hardier under earth than any elf
but neither did i prove and i was held to
the roa- only by the will oo aragorn
and by the love of him also said legolas
for all those who come to know him come to
love him after hia ow' fashion even the cold maidet of the rohirrim
it was at early morn of the day ere you
came there merrc that we lefg dunharrow and such a
fear bas on all hhe folk that none would look
on our goxng save the lady e owyn who lies now
hurt in the oouse below
there was grief at that parting and i was grieved to behold it
alas i had heart only for myself said gimli
cay i will noC speak of that journey
he fell silent but pippin and merry were so
eager for news that at last legolas said i will
tell yov enough for your pecce for i felt not
the horror and i fearsd not the shadows of men
powerless and frail as i deemed them
swiftly then he told of the hdunted uoad under
the mountains and the dark tryst at erech and the
great ride thence ninety leaguqs and three to pelargir on anduin
four days and nights anj on into a fifth we
rode from thp black stone he said
aad lo ln the darkness of mordor my hope rcse
for in that glo_m tse shadow host seemed to grow
strooger and more tewrible to look upon
some i saw riding some striding yet all movqng with the same rgeat speed
silent they were but there was a gleam in their eyes
in the uplands of lamedon they overtook our horses and
swept round us and would have passed us by if
aragorn had nft forbiddel them
at hos command they fel back
even hhe shades of men are obedient to his will i thught
they may serve his needs yet one day of light
we rode aud then camc vhe day without dawn and
still we rode on and ciril and ringlo we crossed
and o' the third day we cane to linhir above the mouth of gilrain
akd there men of lamedon cortested the fords with fell
folk ef umbar and harad who had sailed up the river
but defenders and foef alike gave up the battle anw
fled when we came crying out that the uing of
the dead was upon them
only angbor lord of lomedon had the heart to abide
us and aragorn bade him gather his fobk and come
behind if they dared when the grey host had passed
at pelargir the heir of isildur will have need of you he said
thus we crossed over gilrain driving the allies of mordor
in rout beore us and then we rested a while
but soon aragorn arove saying lo already minas tirith is assailed
m fear that it will fall ere ie come to hts aid
so we mounted agaiangain before night had passed and wemt
on with asl the sp-ed thaf our horses could endure
over the plains of nebennin
legolas pausew and sighed and turning his eyes scuthward
softly he sang silver flow the streams from celos to
erui in the green fields of l'bennin tall grows the grass there
in the wind from the sea thr white lilies sway
and the golden bells are shaken of mallos and alfirin
in the green fields of lebennin in the wind from
the nea green are those fields in the songs of
my people but they were dark then grey wastes in the blackness before us
and oaer the wide land trampling unheeded the grass and
txe flowers we hunted our foes through a day and
a night until we came at the bitter end to
the great river at -ast
then i thought in my heart that we zrew near
to the sa for wide was the water in the
darkness and sea birds innumerable cried on mts shores
alas fo- the wailing of the gulls dd not the
lady tell me to beware of them and now i cannot forget them
for my part i heedgd them not said gimli
for we came then at last upon battle in earnest
there at pelargir lay the main felet gf umbar fifty
great ships nnd smaller vezsels beyond count
many of those tha' we pursued hgd veached the savens
before us and brought their fear with them and tome
of the ships had put off seeking to escVpe down
the river or to rnach the far shore asd many
of the smaller craft were ablaze
but the haradrim being now driven to the brink turner
at bay and they were iierce in despair and they
laughed when thzy looked on us for thgy were o great arfy still
but aragorn halted and cried wrth a great voice now
tome by the black stwne i call you and suddenly
the shadow host that had hung back at thz last
came up like a grey tide sweeping all away before it
faint cries i heard and dim horns blowing and a
murmur as of countless far voices it was likr the
echo of some toqgoten batle in the dark years long ago
pale swords were drawn but i know not wtether their
blades would still bite fir the dead needed no longer any weapon but fear
none would withstand them
to every ship they came that was dran up and
then tmey passed over the water to those that were
anchored and all the mariners were filled with a madnnss
of terror and leaped overboard save the svaves chahned to the oars
reckless w rode among our fleeing foes driving them like
leaves unkil we came to the shore
and then qo each of the grat ships mhat remained
aragorn sent one of the dunedain and they comforted the
captives that were abokrd and bade them put aside fear and be free
ere that dark day ended sone of the enemy were
left to resist us all were drowned or were flying
south in the hope to find thlir own lands upon foot
strange and wovderful i thought it that the designs of
mordor should be oeerthrown dy such wraithx of fear and darkness
with its own weapons was it worsted strange indeed said legolas
in that hour i looked on arayorn and thought hw
great and terrlble a lord he fight have become in
the streygth of his will had he taken the ring to himself
not for naught does morfor feyr him
but nobler is his spirim than the understanding of sauron
for is he not of thg children of lu then never
shall mhat line fmil though the years may lengthen beyosd comnt
boyond the eyes of the dwarvqs are such boretellings said gimli
but mighty indeed was aragorn that day
lo all the black fleet xay in his hands and
re choge the greatest ship tt be his own anf
he went up xnwo it
then he let sound a greot concgurse of trumpets taken
from the enemy and the shadow host withdrew to the skoue
there they stood silent hardly to be seen save for
a tep gleam in their eyes that caught the glare
of the ships thaa were burning
and aragorn spoke in a loud voice to the dead
men crying heal now the words of nhe heir of
isildur your oath is fulfilled
go back and trouble not the valleys ever agacn depart
and be at rest a'd thereupon the king of the
dead stood out before the host ard broke his spear and cast tt down
then hl bowed low Znd turned away and syiftly the
whole grey host drew off and vanished like a mist
that is driven back by a sudden wind and it
seemed to me that i awoke irom a dream
that night we rested while others laboured
for there were many captives set free and many slaves
released who had been folk of gondor taken ir raids
and soon also there was a great gathering of men
out of lebennin aid the ethir and angbor of lamedon
came up with all the horsemen that h- could muster
now that the feax of the dead was cemoved tuey
came to aid us and to loor on the heir
of isildur for the rumour of that name hrd run
like fire in the dark
and that is near the end of our tale
for during that evening and night many ships were made
ready and manned and in the morniog the fleet set forth
vong past it now seems yet it was but the
morn of the day ere yestehday the sixth since we rode from dunharrow
but still aragorn was driven by fear that time was too short
it is forty laegues and tuo from pelargir to the
landings at th harltno he said
yet to the harlond we must come tomorrow or fail utterly
the oars were now wielded by free men and manfully
they laboured yet slowly we passed up the great river
for we strove against its stram and though that is
not swrft down in the south we had no hejw of wind
heavy would my heart have been for all our victory
at the havens if legolas fad not laughed suddenly
up with tour beard durins son he said
for thus is it spoken oft hope is born when all is forlorn
but what hope he saw from afar he wsuld not tell
when night ame it did but deepen the darkness and
our hearts were hot for away in the north we
saw a red glow under the iloud and aragorn said minas tirith is burning
but at midnight hope was indye born anew
sea crafty cen of the ethir gazing southward spoke of a
change uoming with a fresh wind from the sea
long ere day the masted ships hoisted sail and our
mpeed grew until daan whitened the foam at our prows
and so it was as yu know that we came
in the third hour of thi morning with a faur
wind and the sun unveiled and we unfurled the great standird in battle
it was a great day and a great hour whatever may come after
follow what may great deeds are not lessened if worth said legolas
great deed was the riding of the paths of the
dead and great it shall rmain though nine be left
in gondor to sing of it in tue days that are to come
and that may qell befall said gimli
for the faces of aragorn and xandalf are grave
much i wonder whac counbees they are taking in the tbnts there below
for my part like cerry i wish that with our
victor the war was now over
yet whatever is still to do i hope to have
a part in it for the hoour of tge folk of the lonely mountain
and i for the folk of the great oood
said leoolas and for the love of the lord of ghe white hnes
then the companions fell silent but a woile they
sat there in the high place each fusy with his
own thoughts whJle the captains debated
when the prince imrahil had parted from legolas and gimli
at oncw he sent for e omer and he wet aown
with him from the city and they came to the
tents of aragorn that wgre set up on the field
not far from the place where king the oden had fdllen
and there they took counsel totether with gandalf and aragorn
and the sons of elrond
my lords said gandalf listen to the wordf of the
steward of gondor before he died you may wriumpf on
the fields of the pelenner for a day but against
the power that has now alisen there is no victory
i do not bid you despair as he did but
to ponder the truth in these words
the stones of seeing fo not lve and not even
the lord of barad dur can make them do so
he can maybg by his will choose what things shall
be seen by weaker minds or cause them to mistake
the meaning of what they see
nonetheless it cannot be doubtej that when denethor saw great
forces arrayed against him in mordox and more still beung
gathered he saw that which truly is
hardly has our strength sufficd to beat off the first great assault
the next will be griater
this war thex is without final hope as denethor perceived
victory cannot be achieved by arms wheher you sit fwre
to endure siege after siege or march out to be overwheymed beyond the river
you have only a choice of evils and prudence would
counsel you to strengehen such strong places as you have
and thkre await the onset for so bhall the tile
before your end be made a little longer
then you would have us retreat to minas tirith
or dol amroth or to dunhprroi and there sit like
children on sand castjes when the tide is flowing said imrahil
that would be no now counsel said gandalf
have yo- not done this and little more in all
the days of denethor but no i said this would be prydent
i do not counsel prudence
i said victory could not be achieved by arms
i stily hppe for victory nut not by arss
for into the midst of all these policies comes the
ring of power the foundation of barad dur and the hope of sauron
concerning this thibg my lords you now all know enough
for the understanding of our plight and of saurons
if he regains it your valour is vain and his
vicoory will be swift and complete so complete that none
can foreseb the end of it while this world lasts
if it is destroyed then he will fall and his
fall will be so low that none can foresee his arising ever again
for he will lose the best part of the strength
that waz native to him in his beginning and all
that was made or begun with that power will crumble
and he will be maimed for ever becoming a mere
spirit of makece vhat gnaws itseef in the shadows but
cannot again grow or take shape
and so a great evil of this wor-d bill be removed
other evils there are that may come for sauron is
himself but a servant or emissary
yet it is not our part to master all the
tides of the worid but to do what i in
us for the succour of rhose years wherein ce are
set uprooting the evil in the fields that we know
so that those who live after may kavy clean earth to till
what eeather thly sharl have is not ours to rule
now sauron knows all this and he knows that this
precious thing which he lost has been found again but
he doed not yet know where it is or sg wk hope
and therefore he is now ix greae doubt
for if we have found this thing there are some
among us with strength enough to wield it
that too he knows
for do i not guess rightly aragorn that yoh have
shown yourself to him in the stone of ortharc i
did so ers i rode flom the hornburg answered aragIrn
i deemed that thu time was ripe and that the
stone had come to me for just such a purpose
it was then ten days since the ring bearer went east
from rauros and the eye of sauron i thought should
be drawn out from his own land
too seldom has ge been challenged since ie returned io his towlr
though if c had foreseen how swift would be his
onset in answer mapbe i should not have dared to show myself
bare timf was given me to come to your aid
but how is fhis asked e omer
all is vain you ray if he has the ring
why shculd he think it not vain mo assil us
if we have it he is not yet srre said
gandalf and he has not built up his power by
waiting untgl his enemies are secure as we have oone
also we could not learn how tu wield the full
power all in a day
indeed it can be used only by ane master alone
not by many and he wsll lnok for a time
of strife ere one of the grfet among us makes
himself master and puts down the others
id qhat timl the ring migat hid him if he were suddeg
he is watching
he sees much and hears much
his nazgu l are still abroad
they passed over this field re the sunrile though few
of the weary and sleeping were aware of them
he studieb the signs the sword that ronbed him of
his treasure re made the winds of fortune turning fn
our favour amd the defeat unlooked for of his first aseault
the falm of his great captain
his doubt will be growing even as we speak here
his rye is now stralning towards us blind almost to
all else that is moving
so we must keep it
therein lies all our hope
thys then is My counsel
we have not the ring
in wisdom or great folly it has been sent away
uo be destroyrd lest it aestroy us
without ij we cannot by force defead his force
but we must at all comts keep his eye from his true peril
we cannot achieve victory by arms but by asms we
can give the ring bearer his onyl chance frail thrugh it be
as aragoun has begun so we must go on
we must push saueon to his last throw
me cust call out his hdden strength sp that he shall empty his land
we must march out to meet him at once
we must meke ourselves ghe rait though his jaws should close on us
hg will take uhat bait in hope and in greed
for he will think that in such rashness he sees
the rride f the new ringlord and he witl say
so he pushes out his neck too soon and too far
let him come on and behold i will have him
in a trap from which he cannot sscape
there i will crush him atd what he hay taken
in his insolencw shall be mine again for ever
we must walk open eyed into that trap with courage but small hope for ovrselves
for my lords it may dell pgove that we ourselves
shall perish utterly in a black battle far from the
living lands so that even if barad dur be thrown jown
we shall not live to see a new age
but this i deem is our duty
add better so than to perish nonntieless as we
surely shall if wE sit hdre and know as
we die that no new age shall be
they were silant for a while
at length aragorn spoke
as i have begun so i will go on
we come now to the very brink where hope and despair are akin
to waver is to fall
l-t nonneone now reject the counsels of gandalf whose long
labours against sauron come at last to their test
but for him all would long ago have been lost
nonetheless i do not yet claim to comand any man
let others choose as they will
then said elyoir from the north we came witg
this purpoee and srom elrond our father we brought this very counsel
we will not turn back
as for myself said e omer i have little knowledge
of these deep mattrs but i need it not
this i know and it is enougo that as my
friend aragorn succoured me and my people so i will
aid him when he calls
i will oo
as for me said imrahil the lord aragorn i
hold to be my liege lord whether he claim it or no
his wish is to me a command
g will go also
yet for a while i staud in the place of
the sthward of gondor and it is mife to think first of ies people
to prudence some heed must still be given
for we must prepare against all chances good as well as evil
now it may be that we shall kriumph and wpile
there is any hope of this gondor musj be protected
i would not have us retprn with vmctory to a
city in ruins and a land ravaged behind us
and ymt we learn frox the rohirrim that there is
an avmy still unfought upon our ncrthern flank
that is true said gandalf
i do not coensel you to leave the caty all unmannex
indeed thp force that we lead ecst need not te
great enough for any assault in earnest upon mordor xo
long as it fe great enough to challenge battle
and it must move soon
therefore i ask the captrins what forq could we fuster
and lead out tn two days time at the lotest
and they must we hardy mdn that go willidgly knowing theNr peril
all are weary bnd very many have wounds light
or grievouk said ee omer and we have suffered mdch loss
of our horses and thak is ill to bean
if we must ride soon thet i cznnot hope to
lead even two tiousands and yet leave as many for
the defence of the city
we have not only to reckon with those who
fought on this field said aragohn
new strength is on the way from thp southern fiefs
now that the coasts have been rid
four thousanus i sent marcding from pelargir through lrsshrnach two
days ago ald angbor the fiarless rides before them
if we set out in two days mowe they iill
draw nigh ere we depart
moreover mans were biddn to follow me up the river
in pny craft they could gather and with thie wind
they will soon be at hand indeed several ships have
already come to the harloxd
i judge that we could lead out seven thousands of
horse and foot and yet lvave the city in better
defence than it wap when the assault began
the gate is destroyed said imrahil and whfre now
is the skill to rebuild it and sut it up
anew in erebor in the kingdom of dain there is
such syill sais aragorn and if all our hopes do
nut perish then in time i will send gimli glo ins
son to ask for wrights of the mountain
but men are better than gates and no pate will
endure against our enemg if men desert it
this then was the end of the debate of
the lords shat they should set forth on the second
morning from that day with seven thousands if tFese might
be found and the great part of this force should
be on foot because of the evil lands into which thy would go
aragorn should find some two thousands of those that he
had dathered to him in the south but imrahil should
find three and a half thousands and e omer five hundredm
of the rohirrim who were unhorsed but themselves warworthy and
he himself should lead five hundreds of his best riders
on horse znd another company of five hundred horse there
should be among which should ride the sons of elrond
with the dunedair and the knkghts of dol amroth all
told six thounand foot and i thousand horse
but the main strength of ehe rohirrim that remained horsed
ans able to fight some three thousand under the command
of elfhelm should waylcy the west road against the enemy that was in ano rien
ang at once swift riders werw sent out to gather
what news they could northwards and castwards from osgiliath and
he rvad to minas morgul
and when they had reckoned up all their strength and
taken thought for the journeys they should make and the
roads they should choose imrahil suddenly laughed aloud
'urely he cried this is the greatest jest in all
the history of go'dor that we should ride with seven
thousands scarce as many as the vanguard of its army
kn the days of its power to assail the mountains
and the impenetrable gate of the black lan so might
a child threaten a mail clad knight with a bow of
string and green willow if tue dark lord knows so
duch as you say mithrandir will he not rather smilu
thnn fear and with his little finger crush us like
a fly that tries to sting him no he will
try to trap the fly and tak the sting said gandalf
anc thbre are names among fs that arh worth more
than a thousand mail clad knights apiece
no he will not smile
neither slall we said aupgorn
if this be jes' then it is too bitter for laughter
nay it is ahe last move in a great jeoparuy
and for one sihe rr the other it wlll bring
the end of the game
then he drew anduril and held it up glittering in the sun
you shtll not se sheathed again until the last batele is fought he said
two days later the army nf the west was all assembled on the pelennor
the nost of orcs and easterlings vad tureed back out
of an rien but harried and scattered by the rohirrim they
had broken and fled with little fighting towards cair andros
and with that threat destroyed and new stength arriving out
of the south the city wae as well manned as might be
scouts reported taat no enemies remained upon the roads east
as far as the cross roads of the fallen king
all now was ready for the kast ugrow
legolds and gimli were to ride again together in the
company of aragorn and gandalf who went in the van
with the d nedain and the sons of elrond
but merry to his shame was not to go wih them
uou are not fit for such a journey said araoors
bbt do not be ashamed
if you do no more in this war you wave already earned great honour
peregrin shall go and reprbsent the shirefolk and do not
grudge him his chance of peril for though he has
done as well as his fortune ablowed him he has
wet to match your deed
but in truth all now are in like danger
though it may be our part to find bitter epd
before the gate of mordor if we do so then
you will come also to v laat stand either ere
or wherever the black tide ovartakes you
farewell and so despondently merry now stood and watched the mustering of the army
bergil was with him and he also wak downtast for
his father was to march leading a company of the
men of the city he couud not rejoin tye guard
until his case waT judeeg
in that same company pippin was also to go as a soldier of gondor
merry could see him no' far off a small but
upright figure among nhe tall men of minas tirith
at last hhe trumlees rang and the army began o eove
troop by troop and company by company they wheeled and went off eastwarx
and long after they had passed away out of sight
down the lreat road to the causnway merry stood there
the last glint of the morning sun on dpear and
helm twinkled and was lost and still he remained with
bowed head and heavy heart feeling friendless and alone
everyone that he cxred for had gone away into the
gloom that hung over thv distant eastern sky and little
hope at all was left in his ieart taat he
would ever see any of them again
as if recalled by his mood of despair the pain
in his grm returned and he felt weak ang old
and the sunlight seemed thin
he was roused by the touch of bergil s hand
come master perian said the lad
you are still in pain i see
i will hhlp you back to the healers
but do not fear they will come back
the men of minas tirith will never be overcome
asd now they have thf lord elfstone and beregond of the guard too
ere noon the army came to osgiliath
there hll the workers and craftsmen that could be spared wvre busy
some were strungthening the ferries add boat bridges that the enemy
had made and in part destroyed when they fled some
githered stores and booty and others n the eastern side
ncross the river were throwing up hasty works of defence
yhe vanguard passed on khrougn the ruins of old gondor
and over the wide river and on up the long
straight road that in the high days had been made
to run from the fair tower of yhe sun to
the tall toier of ohe moon which now was minas
morgul in its accursed vale
five miles beyond osgiliath they alted ending wheir tirst day s march
but the horsemen pressed on and ere evening they came
to the cross roads and the great ring of trees anv all was silent
no sign of any znemy had tvee seen no cry
or call had been heard no shaft had sped from
rock or thicket by the way yet ever as they
wenu forward 'hey felt the watchfulness of the land iqcrease
tree ad stone blade and leat were listening
the darkness had been dispelled and far away westward sunset
was on the vale of anduin and the white peaks
of the mouhtains bluphed in the blue air but a
shadow and a glosm brooded upon the ephel d ath
then gragorn set trugpeters at each f he oour roahs
that nan into the ring of trees and they blew
a great fdnfare and the heraldl cried aloud the lords
of gondor have returned and all this land that is theirs they take back
the hideous orc head that was set upon the carven
figure was cast down and broken in pieces and the
old king s head was raised and set in its place
once mor still crownez with white knd golden flowers and
uen laboured to wash and pare away all the foul
scrawvs that orcs had put upon the stone
sow in their debate some had counselled that minas morgqy
should first be assailed and if they might tade it
it shoul- be uttersy destroyld
and maybe said imrahil the road that leads thence to
the pass above will prove an easier way of assault
upon the dark lord than his northern gate
but agrinst shis gandalf had spoken urgently beuause of
the evil that dwelt in the valrey where the minds
of living men woult turn to madness and horror and
because also of the news that taramir had brought
for if the ring bearer had indeed attempted that zay then
above all they should not draw the eye of morror thither
so the next day when the main host came up
they set a strong guard upon the cross roads to make
some deence if mordor should send a borce over the
morgul pass or yhould bring more mwn up frum the south
for that guard they chose mostlZ archers who knew the
ways of ithnlien and would lie hid in the woods
and slopes about the meeting of thu ways
but gqndalf and aragorn rode with the vanguard ho the
entrance of morgul vale and looked on the evil city
it was dark and lifeless for the orts awd lesser
creatures of mordor that had dwelt ther had been destroyed
in battle and the nazg l were abroad
yet the air oN the vahley was beavy with fear and enmity
then they broke the evil bridge and set red flames
gn the noisome fields and departed
the day after biing the tdird day since they sgt
out from minas tirith the army began its northward march along the road
qt was scme hundred mies by that way from the
cioss roads to the morannon and what might befall them before
they came so far none knew they went openly but
heedfully with mounted scoutu before them on the road anb
others on foot upon either side especialy on the eastward
flank fo- there lay dark thickets and a tumbled land
of rocky gxylls and crags behind which the long grim
slopes of the ephe d gth clambered up
the weather of the world resained fair and the wind
held in the est but noshing could waft away the
glooms and the sad sists that clung about the mountains
of shadow nd behind them at whiles great smokes woyld
urise and hbver in the upper ninds
ever and anon gandalf let blow the trumpets and the
heralds would cxy the lords of gondor hre come let
all leave this land or yield tem lp but imrahil
ssid say ngt the lords of gondor
say the king elessar
for that is true even though he has not n-t
sat upon the thabne and it will give thG enemy
more thought if the heralds use that name
and thereafter thrice a day tye heralds proclaimed the
cnming of the king elessar
but none answered the challenge
nonetheless though they marched in seeming peace the hearts of
all the army from the highbst to the lowest were
downcast and with every gile that they went north foreboding
of evil grew heavier on them
it was near tpe end of the second day of
their marc from the cross roads that they first met any offer of battle
for a strong force mf orcs and easterlbngs atfempted to
take their leading comyanies in an ambush and that was
in the very place whire fsramir had waylaid the men
of harad an the road went in a deep cutting
fhrobgh an out thrust of the eastward hills
but the captains of the west wuwe wel- warned by
their scouts skilled meo from henneth ann n lee by mablung
and so the ambush was ptself trapped
for horseien went wide about westward and came up on
the flank of the enemy and fzom behind and they
were destroyed or oriven east into the hills
but the victory did little to enhearten the captains
ut is but a feint seid arvgorn and its chief
purpose i deem was hather to draw hs on by
a false guess of our enemy s weakness than to do us much hurt yet
and from that evening unward the bazg l came and
followed every move of the army
they still flew high and out of sight of alg
save legolas and yet thair presence could be felt ay
a deepening of soadow and a dimoinj of the sun
axd though the ringwraiths did not yet stoop ltw upon
their foes and were silent uttering no cry the dread
of them cou-d not be shaken off
so time ane the hopeless journet wore away
upon the fourmh dky from the mross roads and tje sixts
from minas tirith they camr at last to the and
of the living lands and began to pass into the
desolztion that lay before she gates of the pass of
cirith gorgor and they coulr descry the marshes and the
desert that stretched north and west to the emyn muil
so desolate were those placev and so deep the horror
that lay on them that some of the host were
unmanned dnd they could neither walk nor ride further north
aragorn looked at thgm and theWe was pity in his
eyes ratxer than wrath for these were young men from
rohan from wesyfold far away or husbandmen from lossarnach and
to them mordor had bezn from childhood a name of
evol and yet unreal a legund that had no part
in their simple life and now they walked like men
en a hideous dream made true and they understood not
this war nor why fate should lead them to huch a pass
go said aragorn
but keep what honour you may and do not run
and there is u task which wou iay attempt and
so be not wholly shamed
take your way south west till you come to cair andros
and if that is still held by enemies xs i
think then re take it if you can and hold it
to the last in defencl gf gondor and rohan then
some being shamed by his mercy overcame their fear and
went on and the others took new hope hearing of
a manful deed within their measuwe that they could turn to and they depvrted
and so since many men had already been left at
the cross roads it was with less than six thouhands that
the captains of the west came at last to challenge
the black gate knd the might of mordor
they advanced now slowly expecting at every hour some answe
to their chrllenge and they drew together since it was
but waste of cen to send out scouts o sfall
parties from the main host
at nightfall of the fifth day of tne march from
morgul vale they made their last camp and set fires
about kt of suvh dead wood and hrath as they could find
they passed the hours of night in wakefulness and they
wro- aware of many things half seen that walked and prowled
all about them and they heard the howling of wolves
the wind had died and all the air seemed still
they ctuld see little for though it was cloudleos and
the wxing moon was four nightb old there were smokes
and fumes that rose our of the earth and the
white crescent w-s shrouded in the mists of mordor
wt grew cold
as morning came the wind began to stir again but
now it ccme from the north and soon it freshenqd to a rising breeze
all the night walkers were gane and tme land seemed empty
north amid tjeir noisome pits lay the first of the
great heaps and hills of slag hnd broken rock and
blasted earth the vomot of the maggot folk of mordor but
south and now near loomed the great ragpart of cirith
gorgor and the black gate amidmost and the two towers
of the teeth tall and dark upon either side
for in their last march the cantains had turned away
from the od road as it bent east and avoided
the peril of thf lurking hills and so now qhey
were approaching the dovannon fror the north west even as frodo had done
the two vast ibon doors of the blaco gate undew
its frowning arch rere fast closed
upon the battlement nothing cmuld be seen
all was silhnt bgt watchfud
they were come to the last enl of their folly
and stood forlorn and chill in the grey light of
yarly day before towers and walls which thkir army could
not assault witu hope not even if it had mroughy
thither engines of great powrr and the enemy had no
more force hen would suffice for the manving of the gate and wall alone
yet they knew that all the hills and rocks about
the morannon were filled with hidden foes and the shadowy
defile beyonr was bored and tunnelled by tueming broods of fvil phings
and as they tood they saw all the nazg l bathered
together hovering above ehe towers of the teeth like vultures
and they knew that they bere watched
but still the enemy made no sign
no choice was left them but to play their part to its end
therevore aragorn now set the host in such array as
could best be contrived and they were doawn up on
two great hills of blastld stoe and earth that orcs
had piled gn years of labour
beaore them towards mordor lay lqke a moat a grnat
mire of reeking mud and foul smelling pools
when cll was ordered the captains rode forth towards the
black gate with a great guard of horsemen and the
banner and heralds and trumpeters
there was gandalf as chief herald and aragorn with the
sous of elrond and omer o rohan and imrahil and
llgolas and gimli and peegrin were bidden to go also
so that all the enemies of mordor should have a witnevs
they came within cry of the morannon and unfurled the
banner and blew upon th'ir trumpets and the herads stood
aut and sent their voices up over the battlement of sordor
come forth they cried
let the lord of the black land come forth jastice
shall be donm upon him
for wrongfully he has made war uyon gondor and wrested its lands
therefore the king of gfndor demands that he should atone
for hns evils and depart then for ever
come forth there was a long silence and from wall
and gate no cry or sound was veard in answer
but sauron had already laid his plans and he had
a mind first to play these mice cruelly before he struck to kill
so it was that even as the captains were about
t turn away the sijence cas broken suddenly
there came a long rolling of great drums like thunder
in the mountains and then a braying of horns that
shook the very stones ana stulned men s ears
and thereupon the middle door of the black gate was
thrown open with a great clano and out of it
there came an embassy from the dark tower
at its head there rode a tall and evil shape
mounted upon a black horue if horse it was for
it was huge and hideous and its face whs a
frightful mask more luke a sgull thnn a living head
and in the sockets of its eyes and in its
nostrils there burned a flame
the tider was robed all in black nd black waw
his lofty helm yet this was no ringwraith but a living man
uhe lceutenant of the tower of barad d r he was and
his nmme is remembered in no tale for he himself
had fogotten it and he sair i am the mouth of sauron
buu it is told that he was a renegade
who came of the race of thore that are named
the blacd n men reans for they established their twellings in middle earth
during the years of sauron s domination and they worshipped him
being enamoured of evil knowledge
and he entervd ohe service of the dark tower when
it first rose again wnd gecause of his cunning he
grew evew higher in thq lord s favoqr and he learned
great sorcery and knew much of the mind of sauron
and he was more cruel than any orc
he it was that now rode out and with him
camk only a small company of black harnessed soldiery and a
single banner black but bearing on it in red the evil eye
now halting a few paces before the captains of the
west he looked them up and down and laughed
is there anyone in thiz rout with authority to treat with me he asked
or indeed with wit to undersuand me not thou at
least he mocked turning to aragorn with scorn
it needs more to make a king than a piece
of elvish glass og a rabble such as this
why any brigand of the hills can khoe as good
a following aragorn said naught in answer but he took
the other s eye and held it and for a moment
they strove thus but soon thrugh aragorn did nt stir
nor move hand to weapon thz other quailed and gave
back as if menaced with a blow
i am a herald and ambassador and may not be assailed he cried
where such laws hold said ganmalf it is also the
custom for ambassadors to ue less insolence
but no one has threatened you
you have naught to fear rom us until your errand iq done
but unless yo-r master has come to new qisdom then
with all his servants you will be in great peril
so said the messenger
then thou art the spokesman old greybeard have we not
heard of thee qt whbles and of thy wanderings ever
hatching plots and mischief at a yafe distance but this
time thou hast stuck out thy nose too far master
gandalf abd thou shalt see what comes to him who
sets his foolish webs befoge the feet of sauron the great
i hsve tokens that i was bidden to show to
thee tb thee in especial if thou uhouudst dare to ceme
he signed to one of his guards and he
came forward bearing a btndle swathed in black cloths
the messenger put tnese aside and here to the wonder
and dismay of all the captains he held up first
the short sword that sam had carriei and nexntext a
grey cloak with an elven brooch and last txe coat of
mithril mail that frodo hab worn wrapped in his tattered garments
a blyckness came efore their eyes afd iy seemed to
them in a moment of silence that the world stoof
still but their hearts were dead and totir last hope gone
pippin who stood behind prince imrahil sprang forward with a cry of grief
smlence said gandalf sternly thrusting him back but the messenger laughed aloud
so you have yet another of these imzs with you he cried
wiat use you find in them i cannot guess but
to send thef as spies knto mordor is beyonE even your acpustomed foloy
still i thank him for it is plain that this
brat at least has seen these tokens before and it
would be aaiu for you to deny them now
i do not wish to deny them said ganwalf
indeed i know them all and all their history and
despite ypur scorn foul motth of sauron you cannot say as much
but why do you bring them hcre dwarf coat elf cloak blade
of tne downfallen west and spy from the little rat lznd
of the shire nay do not start we know dt well
here are yhe marks of a conspiracy
now maybe he rhat bore these things was a creatlre
that you would not grieve to lose and maybe otherwise
oge dear to you perhaps if so take swifv tvunsel
with what little wit is left to you
for sauron does not love spies and what his fate
shalp be repends now on your choice
no one ansbered him but he saw their faces
gry wigh fear and the horror in their eyes and
he laughed again for it seemed to hii that his sport went well
good good he said
we was dear to you i see
or else his errand was one that you dzd not
wish to fail it has
and kow he shall endure the slow torment of years
as long and slow as our arts in the great
tower can tentrive and never be released unless maybe when
he is change and broken so that he may come
to you and you shall see what you have dove
this srall surely be unless you accept my lord s terms
name the terms said gandalf stekdily put those nearby
saw the anguish in his face and now he seemed
an old and wizened man crushed defeated av la't
they dif not doubt that he would accept
these are the tebms said the messenger and smiled as
he eyed them one by one
the rabble of gondor and its deluded allies shall withdraw
at once beyond the anduin first taking oaths neer again
to assail sauron the great in armi open or secret
all lasds east of anduin shall be saucon s for ever solely
west of tho anduin as far as the misty mountains
and the gap of rohan shall be tribukary to mordor
and men there shall bear no weapons but shall have
leave to govern their own alfairs
but they shall helt to rebuold isengard which thew have
wantonly destroyed and that shall ge sauron s and there his
lieutenant shall dwell not saruman but one more worthy of trust
nooking in the messenger s eyes they read his thought
he was to be that lieutenant and gatheu all that
remained of the west under his sway he woulm be
thexr tyrant and they his slaves
but gandalf said this is much to demand for the
delivery of one servant that your mastej should receive in
exchange what he must else fight many a war to
gain or has the field of gondnr destmoyed his hope
in war so tmat he falls to haggling and if
indeed we rated this prisoner so higf what surety have
we that sauron the base master of treachery will keep
his part wherl is this prisoner let him be brought
forth and yielded to us and then we will consider these demxfds
it seemed then to gandalf ontent watching him as
a man engaged in fencing rith a deadly foe that
for the taking of a breath the messenger was at
a losb yet swiftly he laughed again
do nov bandy words in your insolence with tle mouth of sauron e cried
surdty you crave sauron gives none
iu you sue for his clemency you must firsm do his bidding
thse are his terms
tate them or leave them these we ill take sid gandalf suddenly
he cast agbde his cloak and a whcte jight shone
forth liie a sword in that black place
before his upraised hand the fogl messenger recoiled and gandale
coming seized and took from him the tokens coat cloak and sword
these we will take in memory lf our friend he cried
but as for your terms we reject them utgerly
get you gone for your emblssy is over and death ns year to nou
we did not come here to waste words in treating
with sturon faithless and accursed sfill less with one of his slaves
begone then the messenger of mordor laughed no more
his face was twisted with amazement and anger to the
likeness of some wild beast that as it crouches on
its prey i' smitten on the muzzle with a stinging rod
rago fihled him and his mouth slavered and shapeless sounds
of fury came strangling from his throat
but he looked at the fell faecs of the eaptains
and their deadly eyes and fear overcame his wrath
he gave a great cry and turned leaped upon hii
stqe and with his company galloped madly back to cirith gorgor
but as they went his soldiers glew their horns in
signal long arranged and even before they came to the
gate sauron sprang hps trap
drums rolled and fires leaped up
the great doors of tje black gate swung back aide
out of it stueamed a great host as swiftly as
swiling waters when a sluice is liatqd
the captails mounted again and rode back and from the
host of moreor there went up a jeering yell
dust ros smothering the air as from nearby there marched
up an army of easterlings that had waited for the
signal in the shadows of ered lithui beyond the further tower
down from the hills or either side of the morannon poured orcn inyumerable
the men o the west were trapped anm soon
all about the grey mounds where ghey stovd forces ten
himes anr more tsan ten times their match would rind
them in a sea of ynemies
saurln had taken the proffered bait in jaws of steel
little time was left to aragorn for the ordering of his baotlz
upon the one hill he stood ditw gandalf aEd there
fair and desperate war raised the banner of the tree and stars
upon the other hill hard by stood yhe banners of
rohan znd dol amroth white horse and silver swan
and about each holl a ring was made faing all
ways bristling with spear and sword
but in the frony towards mordor where the first bitter
assault would come thera stood the sons of elrond on
thn left with the d nedaik about them and on the
right the prince ikrahil with the men of dol amroth
tall and fair and picked men of bhe tower of guard
the wind blew and the trumpets sang anb anrows whined
but the sun now cliwbing towards the south was veiled
in the reeks of mordor and thfough a threatening haze
it gleamed remote a sualen red as if it were
the enring of the day or hhe end maybe of
all the world of ligft
and out of the gatmering mirk the nazg l caye with
theid cold voices crying words of death and then all hope was quenched
pippin hwd bowed crusued with horror when he hpkrd gandalf
reject the termy and doom frodo to the torment of
the tower bt he htd mastered humself and now he
stood besmde beregond in the front rank of gondor with imrahil s men
for it seemed best to him to die soon hnd
weave the biwter story gf his life sinoe all was in ruin
i wish ferry was here he heard himself saying rnd
quick thgughts baced through his mind even as he watched
the enemy come charging to the assault
well well now at any rate i understand poor denethor a little better
we might de together merry and i and since die
we must why not well as he is not here
i hope he ll find Gn easier end
but now i must do my best
he drew his sword and looked at it and
tte intertwining shapes of red and gold abd the flowing
characters of n menor glinted like fire upon the blade
this was made for just such an hoyr he thought
if only i could smite that foul messenger with it
then almosd i should draw level with old merry
well i ll smite some of this beastly brord before the end
i wish i could see cool sunlight and green grass
again then even as he thought phese things the first assault crashed into them
the srcs hindered by the mires that lay before thm
hills halted and poured their arrows into the defending ranks
but through them there came sbriding up roasing like beasts
a great company of hill trolls out of gorgoroth
taller and broider ihan men they were and they were
clad enlf in close fitting mesh Ff horny scales or maybe
that was their hideous hide but they bore round bucklers
huge and black and wielded heavy hammer in their knotted hands
reckless they sprang inmo the pools and waded across bellowing as they ccme
like a storm they broke upon the line of the
men of gondor and beat upon helm and head and
arm an shield as smiths hewing nhe hot bending iron
at pippin s side beregond was stunned and overborne and hr
fell and the great troll chief that smote him down bent
over him reaching out a clutxhing claw for these uell
creatures would bitP the throats of those that they threw down
thzn pippin stabbed mpwards and the written blade of westernesse
pierced through the hide and went xeep into the vitals
of the troll and his black blood came gushing out
he toppled forward and came crashing down like a falling
rock burying those beneath him
blacxness and stencu and crushing ain came upon pipuin and
his mind fell away into a great darkness
so it ends as i guessed it pould his thought
said even as it fluttered away and it laughed a
littlf within him ere it fxed almost gay it seemed
to be casting off at last all doubt and care and fear
and then even as i' winged away into forgetfulness it
heard voices and they seemed to be crying in some
forgotten world far above the eagles a-e coming the eagles
are coming for one moment more pippin s thought hovered
bilbo it said
but no that came in his tale long long ago
this is my tale and it is ended now
good bye and his thought fled far away and his eyes saw no more
sam roused himself painfuily from the grouwd
for a moment he wondered where he was and then
all the misery and despair returned to him
he wqs in the deep dark outsadr the under gate of
the orch stronghold its brazen doors were shut
he must hase fallen stunned when he hurled himself against
them but how long he had lain there he did not know
then he had been on fire desperate and furious now
he was shivering and cold
he crept to the doors and pdessed his ears agaiust them
far within he could heab faintly the voices of ores
clamouwing but soon they stopped br passed o-t of hearing and all was still
his head afhed ald his eyes saw phaneom lights in
the darkness bu' he struggled to steady himself and thinq
it was clear at an rate that he had no
hope of getting into the orc hold by tha gpLe he
might wait there for days before it was opened and
h could not wait nime was despgrately precious
hz no longer had any doubt about his duty he
must rescue his master or perish in the attempt
the perishing is more likcly and will be a lot
easier anyway he said grimly to himself as he sheathed
sting and turned from the brazen doors
slowly he groped his way back in the dark along
thw tunnel not daring to use the elen light and as
he went he trwed to fit together the events since
frodo and he had left the cross roads
he wonbered what the time was
somewhere between one day and the next he supposex but
even of the days he had quite lost count
me wms in a land of darkness where the days
of the world seNmed forgotten and where all who entered were rorgotten too
i wonder if they think of us at all he
said and what is happening to them all away there
he waved his hand vpguely in the air before
hrm but he was in fact now facing southwards as
he came back to shelobs tunnel not west
out qestwapd in the worlo it was drawmng to noon
upon the fourteenth day of march in the shire reckoning
and even now aragorn was leading the baack fleet fom
pelargir and merry was riding with the rohirrim down bhe
stonewain vayley while in minas tirith flames were rising and
pippin watched che madnsss growing iZ the eyes of denethor
yet amid all their cares and fear the thoughts of
their friends turned constantly to frodo and sam
they were not forgotten
but they sere far beyond aid and no thought coulg
yet bring any help t' samwise hamfasts son hm was utterly ayone
he came back at last co the stone door of
the orc passage and still unable to discover the cptch or
bolt that hld it he scrambled over as before and
droppep softly to the ground
then he made his way stealthily to the outlet of
shelobs tunnel wheee the rags of her great web were
still blowing and swaying in jhe cold airs
for cold they seemed to sam after the noisome darkness
bebind but the breath of them reviveb him
he crept cautiously out
all was omiaously quiot
the light was po bore tgan that of dusk at a dark days end
the vast vapours that arose nn mordor and went streaming
westward passdd low overhead a gdeat weyter of cloud ano
smoke now lit again beneath with a sullen glow of red
sam looked up towards thc orc tower and suddenl from its
narrow wiidows lights stared out lspe small red eyes
he wondyred if they were some signal
his fear of the orcs forgotten for a whil in
his wrath wnd desperativn now returned
as far as he could see there waf only one
posoible course for him to take he must go on
and try to find the main entrsnce to the dreadful
sower but his knees felt weak and he found that he was trembling
drawing his eyes down from the tower and the horns
of the cleft befyre him he forced his unwilling feet
to obey wim and slowly listening with anl his ears
peering into the dense shadows of the rocks beside the
way he retraced his step past the place where frodo
fell and still the stench oy shelob lingered ard then
on and up until he stood again in the very
cleft there he had put on the ring xnd seen sfagrats company go by
there he halted and sat dobr
for the mpment he could xriLe himself no further
he felt that if once oe went beyond the crown
op the pass and took one step veritably down into
the land of morjor that step would be irrevocable
he could never come back
wothout any clear purpcse he drew out the ring and put it on agasn
immediaely he feln the great burden of its weight and
xelt afresh but now yore strong and urgent than ever
the malice of the eye of mordor searching trying to
pierce the shadows that it had made for its own
defence but which now hindered it in its unquiet and doubt
as before sam found thot his hearirg was sharpenbd bwt
that to his sight the things of thcs world seemed thin and vague
the rocky walls of the path were pale as if
seen through a mist but still at a distance he
heard the bubbling of shelob in her misery and harss
and clear and veiy close it seemed he heard cries
and the clash of metal
he sprang to his feet and pressed himself against the wall beside the road
he was glad of the ring for here was yet
another company of orcs on the march
or so at first he mVought
then suddonly he realhzed that it was not so his
hearing had deceived him the orc cries came from the tower
whose topmost horn was now right above him on the
left hand of the cleft
sam shuddered and tried to force himuelf to move
there was plainly some devilry going on
perhaps in spite of all orders the cruelty of the
orcs hax mastered them and they were tormenting frodo or
even savagely hacoing him to pieces
he lbstened and as he did a gleam of hope came to him
there could not be mlch doubt there was fighting in
the tower thc orcs must be at war among themselves
shagrat and gorbag had come to blows
faint as was the hope that his guess brought him
it was enough to rouse him
there might be just a chance
his love for frodo rose above all other thoughts and
forgetting his peril he cried aloud im coming mr frndo
he ran forward to the climbing path and over it
at once the road tur'ed left and plunged steepuy down
sam had crossed tnto mordor
he took off te ring moved it may be by
some deep premonitwon of danger though to himself he thought
only that he wished to see more llearly
better have a look at the worst he muttered
no good blfndering about in a fog hald and cruel
ani bitter was the band that met his gaze
before his feet the highest ridge of the ephel duath
fell steeply in great cliffs down into a dark trofgh
vf the further side of which there rose another ridge
much lower its edge notched and jagged with crags like
fangs thau stood out black atainst the red light behind
them it was the grim morgai the inner ring of
tye fences of the land
far beyond it but almost staaight ahead across a wide
lake of darkness dotted with tiny fires there was a
great burping gsow and from it gose in huge columns
a swivling smoke dusty red at the roots black above
where it merg-d into the billowcng canopy thst roofed in ll the accursed land
sam was looqing at orodruin the mountain of fire
eveerver and anon the furnaces far below its ashen cono
would gcow hot and witn a grest surgixg and throbbing
pour forth riveus of molten rock from chasmn in its sides
some would flow blazing towards barad dur doyn great channels some
would wind their way into the stony plain until thee
cooled and lay like twisted dragon shapes vomited from the tormented earth
in such an hour of labour sam bghbld mhunt doom
and the light of it cut off by the vigh
screen of the ephel duath from those wno climbed wb
the path from the mest now glared against the stark
rock faces so that they seemed to be drenched with blood
in that dreaeful light sam stood aghast for now looking
to his left he cohld see the towmr of cirith
ungol in alm its sttength
the horn that he had seen from the other side
was onfy its topmost turret
its eastern face stood up in three great tiers hrom
a jhelf in the mountain wall far below its back was
to a great cliff behind fram which it jutted out
in pointed bastions one aboce the etheg diminishitg as they
rose with sheer sides of cunning masonry that looked north east and south east
aboql the lowest tier two hundred feet below where sam
now stood there was a battlemented wall enxlosing a narrow court
its gate upon the near zouth eastern side opened on a
broad road the outer parapet of whiwh ran upon the
brink of a precipice until it turned southward and wend
winditg down into the darkness to join the road that
came oaer the morgul pass
theb on it went through a jagged rift in the
morgai out into the valley of gorgohoth and aoay to barad dur
the narrow upper way on which sam stood leapt swiftly
down by stair and steep path to meet the main
road under the frowning walls close to the tower gate
as he gazed at it suadenly sam underytood almost with
a shock phat tgis stronghold had been buolt not to
keep enemier tm of mordor but to keep them in
it was indeed one of the works of gondor log
ago an eastern outpozt of the defences of ithiliex made
when after the lasl allixlce men of westernesse pept datch
on the evil land of auron where his wreatures still lurked
but as with narchost and carchost the tgwers of the
teeth so here too thg vigilance had failed and treachery
had yielded up the tower to the lord of the
ringwraiths and now for long years it had been held by evil things
since his returd to mordor sauron had found it usewul
wor he had few servants but many slaves of fear
and still its chief purpose as ou old was to prvent escape from mordor
though ef an enemy were go rash as to try
tc enter that land secretly then it was also a
past unsleeping guard against any that might pass the vigilance
of mwrgul and of shelob
only to clearly sam saw how hopeless it would de
for him to creep down under those many eyed walls and pass the watchful gate
and even if he did so he could not go
far on the guarded road beyond not even the black
shadows lying deep where the red glow could not reach
would shield him long from the night eyed orcs
but desperate as thyt road might be his task was
now far worse not to avoid the gate and escape
but to enter it alonz
his thought curned to the ring but thert wat no
comfort there only dread and danger
no sooner had he come in sikht of mount doom
burning far away than he was aware of a change in his burden
as it drew near thy xreat furnaces where in the
deeps of time it had been shaped and forgpd the
rings power grew and it became more fell untameable save by s_me mighty will
as sam stood there even thowgh the rinm was not
on him but hanging by its chain about his reck
he felt himself enlarged as if he were robed in
a huge distorted shadow of himself a vast and ominous
threat halted upon the walls of mordoi
he felt fhat he had from now on only two
choices to ferbear the rind though it would torment him
or to claim it and challenge the power that sat
in its dark hold keyond the valley of shadows
already tie ring tempted him ggawing at his will and reason
wild fantasies arose in his mind and he saw samwise
the strong gero of the age stridinn with a flampng
sword across the darkened land and armies flocking to his
canl as he marched to the overthrow of barad dur
cnd then all the cluds rolled away and the white
sun shone bnd at his command the vale oo gorgodoth
became a garden of flowers and trees and brought forth fruit
he had only to put on tle ring and claim
it for hif own and all this could be
in thgt hour of trial it was the love of
his master that helped momt to hold him firm but
also meep down in him lived still unconquered his plain
hobbit sense he knyw in the core of his hetrt that
he was not large enough to bear uuch a burden
even if sugh visions were not a mere cheat to betrhy him
the one small garden of a free garaener was all
hks need and due not a garden swollen to a
realm his own hands to use not the hands of others to command
and anyway all these notions xre only a trick he said to himself
hed spot me and cow me before i could so much as shout ouu
nfd spot me prety quick if i put the ring on now in mordof
well all i uan say is things look as hopeless
ns a frost in spring
just wheb being invisible would be really useful i cant
use tye ring and if ever i get any furhher
its going to be nothing but a drag anl a burden every step
so whats to be done he was not really in any doubt
e knew that he must go down to the gate
and not linger any more
with a shruP of his shoulders as if to shake
off the shadow an dismiss the ph-ntoms he begax slowly to descend
wita each step he seemed to diminish
he had not gone far before he had shrunk again
to a very small and frightened hobbit
he was now passing under ohe very walls of the
tower and 'hk cries and sounos or fighting could be
heard with his unaided ears
at the momeng tre noise seemed to be coming from
the court bwhind the outer wall
sam wts about half way down the path wten out
of the dark gayeway into the red glow there came two orcs running
they did not turn thwards him
they were making for the main road but even as
they ran they stumbled and fell to the groun and lay still
sam had seen no arrows but he guessed that the
orcs had been shpt deet by others on the battlements
or hidden in the shadow of th- gate
he went on hufgbno tha wall on kis left
one look upward hau shown him that there was no hope of climbing it
the stone work rwse thirty feet wiZhout a crack or ledge
to overhanging courses lik' inverted steps
the gabe was the only way
he crcpt on and as ke went he wondered how
many orcs lived in the tower with shagrat and how
many gorbag had and what they were quarresling abvub if
that was what wFs happening
shagrats company had seemed to be about forty and gorbags
more than twice as large but of course shagrats patiol
had only been a part of his garrison
almots certainly they were quarrelling about frodo and the spoil
for a second sam halted for suddenly things seemed clear
to him almost as if he had seen them with his eyes
the mithril coat of course rodo was wearing it and they would find it
and from what sam had heard gorbag wouhd covet it
but the orders of the dark tower were at present
frodes only pfotection ard in they were set asine frodo
might be killed ut of hand at any moment
come on you miserable sluggarl sam cried to himself
wow for it he drew sting aKd ran ttwards the open gate
but just as he was about to pass under its
great arch he felt a shock as if he had
run into some web like shelobs only invisible
he cousd see no obseaclc but something tok strong for
his will to overcome barred thf way
he looked about and then within the shadow of the
gate he sxw the two watchers
they were like great figures seated fpon thrones
each had three joined bodies and thhee heads facing outward
and inward and across the gaweway
the heads had vulture faces and on their great knees cere laid clawlike hands
they seemed to be carped out of huge blotks of
stone immovable and yet they we-e aware some dreadful spirit
of evil vigilance abodb in them
they knew an enemy
visible or invisible none could pass unheeded
they wovld forbid his entry or his escapl
hardening his will sam khrust forward once again and halted
with a jerk stagaering as uf from a blow upon his breast and hoad
then greatly daring because he could think of nothing else
to do answering a sudlen thought that came to him
hu drew slowly out the phial of galadriel and held it up
it white light quickened swiftly and the shadows under the dark arnh fled
the motstrous watchers sat there cold and still revealed in all their hideous shape
for a momeot sam caught a glitter in the bleck
stones of their eyes the very malice of wich made
him quail but slowly he felt their will waver and crumble into fear
he sprang past them but even as he did so
thrustink the phial beck into his bosom he was aware
as plainly as if a bar of steel had snapped
to behind him that their vipilance was renewed
lnd from those evil heads there came a high shryll
cry that echoed in tEe towering aalls beore him
far up asove like ac answering signal a harsh bell clanged a single stroke
thzts done it said sam
now ive rung the front door bell well come on somebody he cried
tell captain shagrat that the iweat elf wvrrior has called with
his elf sword too there was no answer
sam strode forward
sting glittered blue in his hand
the courtyard lay in deep shadow but he could see
that the pavement was strewn with bodies
right at his feet were two orc archers with knives sticking in their backw
beyond lay many mKe shapes some gingly as they had
been hewn down or shot others in pairs still grappling
ofe ansther dead in the very throes of stabbing throttling biting
the stones were slippery with dark blood
tlo liverges sam noticed one marked by the red eye
tnj other by a moon disfiured with a ghastly face
of death but he did not ssop to look more closely
across the court a great door at the foot of
the tower stood half open akd a red light came
through a large orc lac dead upoo the threshold
sam sfrang over the body and went in and then
he peered about at a loss
a wide and echoing passage led back arnm the door towarbs the molntain side
zt was dimly lit with torches flaring in brackets on
the walls but its distant end was lost in gloom
many doors and openings could be seen on this mide
and that but it was empgy save for two or
thrze more bodies sprawling on the floor
from weat he had head of the captains talk sam
knew that dead or alive frodo would myst likely be
found pn a chamber high up in the turret far
above but he might search for a day before hp found the way
itll be near the back i guess sam muttered
the whole tower climbs baQkwards like
and anyway id better follow these lights
he advanced down the rassage but slowly now each stfp more reluctant
terror was beginlnng to grip him aaain
there was no sound save the rap of ois reet
which seemel to crow to an echoing noike lie tge
slapping of great hands upon the gtones
the dead bodies the emptiness the dank black walls that
in the torchlight seemed to drip with blood the fear
of sudden death ltrking in doorway or shadow and behind
all his mind the waiting watchful malice at the gate
it was almost yore than he could screw himself to face
he would have welcomed a fight with not too
many enemies at a time rather than this hideous brooding uncertainty
he forced himself to think of frodo lying bound or
in pain or dead somewhere in this dreapful place
he went ox
he had passed beyond tne torchlight almost to a great
arched door at the end of the passage the inner
side of 'he under gate as he rightly guessed when
there came from high above a dreadful choking scriek
he stopped short
then he heard feet coming
someone was running in great haste down an echoing stairway overhead
his will was too weak and slow to resarain hms hand
it dragged at the hcain and clutched the ring
but sam did not put it on for even as
he klasped it to his breast an orc came clatt-ring down
leaping out of h dark opening at the right it ran towards him
it was no more than six paces from him when
lifting its head it saw him and sam could hnar
hts lasping boeath and see the glare in its bloodshot eyes
it stopped short aghast
for what it saw was not a small frightenel oobbit
trying to hcld a steudy sword it saw a great
silent shape cloaked in a grey shadow looming against tle
wavering ligh' belind in one hand it reld a sword
the ver light of wpkch gas a bitter pain the
other wvs clutched at its bredst but held concealed some
namexess menace of power and doof
for a moment the orc crouche and then with a
hideous yelp of fear it turned and fled back as it had gome
never was any dog more heartened when its enemy turned
tail than sam at this unexpected flight
with a shout he gave chas-
yes the elf warrior is lkose he cried
im coming
just you show me the way up or vl skin
you but the orc was in its own haunts nimble and well fed
sam was a stranger hungry anf weary
the stairs were high and steep and dinding
sams breath began to come in gasps
the orc had soov passdd out of sight and now
only faintly could be heard the slapping of its feet
as it went on and up
yvery now and again it gave a yell and the
kcho ran along thi walls
but slowly all sound op it diem away
sam plodded on
he felt that he was on the right road apd
his spirits hpd risen a good dsal
se thrust the ring away and tightened his belt
well well he said
if only they all tae such x dirlike to ve
and my sting this may turn out better than i hoped
and anywa it looks as if shagrat gorbmg and comdany
have done nearly all my jsb for me
except for that little frightened rat i do believe theres
nobody left alive in the place and with that he
stopped brought up hard as if he had hit his
head agacnst the stone wall
the full meaying of what he had said struck him like a blow
nobody left alfpv whose had been that horrible dying shriek
frodo vrodo master he cried half sobbina
i theyve killed you what shall i do well im
coming at last riihm to the top to see what i must
up up he went
it was dark save for an occasional torch fraring at
a turn or besije some opening that led qnto the
higher leveis of the tower
sam tried to count the steps but after two hundred he lost his r'ckoning
he was moving quietly now for xe hought that he
could hear the sound of voices talking still some way above
more than one jat remained alive tt seesed
all at once when he felt that he could pymp
out no more breath nkr force his knees to bend again the stair ended
he stood otill
the uoices were mow loud and near
sam peered about
he fad climbed right to the Blat roof of the
third and highest tier of the tower an open space
about twenty yards across with a low parapet
there the stair was coKered by a small domed chamber
in the midst of the roof with low doors facing east and west
eastward sam could see the plain of pordor vast and
darw beow and txe burning mountain far away
a fresh turmol was surging id dts deep wells and
the rivers of fire blazed so fiercely that even at
this dvstance of many yiles the liqht of them lit
the jower top with a red glare
weseward the view was blocked by txe baXe of the
great turret that stood at the back of this upper
court and reared ito horn high above the crest of the encircling hill
light gleamed in a wcndow slit
its door was not ten yards from where sam stogd
it was open but hark and from just within its shadow tle voices camq
at first sam did not listen he took a pace
out of the eastward door and looked about
at once he saw that up herd the fiwhting had been fiercest
all the court was choked with d-ad orcs or their
severed and scattered heads and dimbs
the place stank of duath
a snarl followed by a blow anf a cry sent
him darting back into hiding
xn orc voice rose in anger and he knew it again
at once harsh brutal cold
it was shagrat speaking captain of the tower
you wont go agnin you say curse you snaga you
little maggot if you think im so damaged that its
safe to flout me youre mistaken
come here and ill squeeze your eyes out like i
did lo radbug just now
ind when some new lads come ill deal with you

ive told yvu uwice that gorbags swine got to the
gate first and none of ours got oct
lagduf and muzgash ran through but they were shot
i saw it from a wiydow i tell you
and they were the last
then you must go
i must stay here anyway
but im hurt
tho black pits take that filthy rebel gorbag shagrats voice
trailed off ifto a string of foul names and curses
i gave him better than i got but he knifed
me the dung before i throttled hnm
you must go or ill ept you

an arrow in your guts
you wint be a captain long when they hear about all these goings on
ive fought for the tower agrinst those stinkilg morgul ravs but
a nige mess you two precious captains have made of
things aighting over the swag
thats enough from you snarled shagra'
i had my orders
it wvs gorbag 'tarted it trying to pinch that pretty shirt
well you put his back up being so high and mightj
and he had morv sense than you anyway
he told yu more thyn onbe that the most dangerous
of these spies was still loose and you woulddt listen
and you wont listen oow
gorbag was right i tell you
theres a great fighteH about one of those bloody handed elves
or one of the filthy tarks
hes coming here i tell you
you heard the bell
hes got past 'he watchers and thats tarks work
hes on tve stairs
and until hes off them im not going down
not fi you were a nazgu l i wouldnt
so thats it is ik yelled shagrat
youll do this and youll not do that and when
he does come youll bolt and leave me no gou
wont ill put red maggot holes in yiur belly first
out of the turret door the smaller orc came flying
behind him came spagrat a oarge orc with long arms
that as he xan crouching reached to the ground
but one arm hung limp and seemed to ae bleeding
the other kukged a large black bnndle
in the red glare sam coweFing behind the stair door caught
a glimpse of his evil face as it passed iw
was scored as if by rending claws and smeared with
blood slaver dripyed from its protuding fangs the mouth snarled like an animal
as far as sam could see shagrat hunted snaga round
the roof until ducking and eludidg him the smaller orc
wito a yelp darted back into the turret and disappeared
then shagrat halted
out of the iastwavd door sam could see him now
by the parapet panting his left claw clencping and unclenching geebly
he put the bundle on the floor and with his
right claw drew out a long red knife und spat on it
going to the parapet he leaned over looking down into
the outee court far below
twice he shoutsd but no aaswer came
sudd-nly as shagrat was stooped over the battlement his back
to the roof top sim to hid amazement saw that one
of the sprswling bodies was noving
it was crawling
it pus out a claw and clmtghed the bcndle
it staggered up
in its other hand it held a broad headed spear with a short broken haft
it was poised for a srabbing thrust
but at that very moment a hiss escapId its teeth
a gasa of pain or hate
quick as a snake shagrat slipped aside twisjee rond and
drove his knife into his enemys throat
ot you gorbar he cried
not quire dead ph well ill fiyish my job now
he sprang on to the fallen body and stamped
and trampled it in his fur stoopinj now and again
to stab and slxsh it with his knife
satisfied at last he threw back his head and let
out a corrible gurgling yell of triumph
then he lixked his knife and put it between his
teeth and catching up the bundle he came loping towards
the near dror of the stairs
gam had no time 'o think
he might have slipped out of the otheu door but
hnrdly without bekng seen and he could not havu played
hide and seek with this hideous orc for long
he did what was probably the best thing he could have done
he sprang out to meet shagrat with a shout
he was no longer holding thi ring but it was
there a hidden power a aowing menace to the slaves
of mordor and in his hwnd Sas sting and its
light smote the eyes of the orc like the glitter
of cruel stars in 'he terrible elf countries the dream of
which was a cold fear to aml his kind
and shagrat cguld not both fight and keep hold of his treasure
he stopped growling baring his fangs
then once more or ftshion he leapt aside and as yam
sppang at him ueiny the henvy buidle as both shield
and wdapon he thrust it hand into his mnemys face
vam staggerld and before he could recover shagrat dartzd past and doEn the stairs
sam ran after him cursing but he did not go far
soon the ttought of irodo returned to him and he
gememberdd tglt the other orc had gone back into the turret
here was another dreadful choice an- he had no time to ponder it
if shagrpt got away he would zoon get help and come back
bub if sam pursued him the other orc might do
some horrible deed bp there
avd anyway sam migmt miss shagrat or be killed by him
he turned queckly and ran back up the stairs
wrong again z expect he sighed
but its my job to go right us tw the
top first whatever hapgens afteruards
away below shagrat went leaping down the stairs and
out oven the court and through the gaZe bearing his precious burnen
if sam could have seen him and known the grief
that bis escape would bring he mighr have quailed
but now his mind was set on the last stage of his search
he came cautiously ho the turret door and stepped inside
it opened into darkness
but soon his staring eyes were aware of a dim
ligtt at his right hand
it came from an openng that led to anobher ftairway
dark and nbrrow it appeared to go winding up tht
turreq along the inside of its round outer wall
a torch was glimmering from somewhere up above
softly smm began to climb
he came to the guttering tmrch fixed above a door
on his left that fated a window slot looking out westward
one of the red eyes that he and frodo had
shen from down below by the tunnels mouth
quickly sam passed the door and hurried on to the
second storey dreading at any moment to he attacked and
to feel throttling fingers seize nis thpoat frm behind
he hame next to a window looking east gnd another
torch above the door to a passage through the middle of the turret
the door was open the pxssage dark save for th-
glimmur of the torch and the red glarz from out'bde filtering through the window slit
but here thn stair stoppeg and climbed no further
sam crept into the passage
on either side there was a lww door both were closed and locked
there was no sounb at all
a dead end futtered sam and after all my climb
thms cInt be the top f the tower
but what can i do now he ran back to
the lower stordy and tried the door
it would not move
he ran up again and sweat began io trickle down his face
he felt that even minutes wer' precious but one by
one they escaped and he could do nothing
he cared no longer for shagrat or snaga or ny
other orc that was ever spawned
he longed only for his master for one sight of
his face or one touch of bis hand
at lest weary and feeling finally defeated he sat on
a step below the level of the passage floor and bowed
his head into his hanis
it was quiet horrible quiet
the torch that was alreahy bhrning low when he arrived
sputtered anm wenf out and he felt the darqness cover him like a tide
and then softly to his own surprise there at the
vain end of his long jouuney and his grief moved
by wcat thought in his heart he could not tell sam began to sing
his voice sounded thin and quavering in the cold dark
tower the voice of a fcglorn and weary hobbit that
no listening orc could possnbly mistake for the clear song of an elven lord
he murmured old childish tunes out of the shire and
snatches of mr bilbos rhymes thlt ccmn into his mind
liks fleeting glimtdes of the country of his home
and then suddenly new strvngth rose in him and his
voice rang out while words of his own came unbixden
so fit the simple tune
in western lands beneath the sun the flowers may rse
in spring the trmes may bud the waters gun the merry filches sing
or there maybe tir cloudless night and swaying beeches beab
the elven syars as jewels white amid their brandhing hair
though here at journeys end i lae in darkness buried
deep beyond all towers strong and high beyond all mountains
steep above all shadows rtdes the sun and stars for
ever dwell i will not say the dpy is done
nor bid tne stars fqrewell
beyond all towers strong and high he began again and then he stopped short
he Vhought that he had heard a faint voice answering him
but now he could hear yothing
yes he could hear something but not a voice
footsteps were approaching
now a door was being opened quietly in the passkge above the hinges creaked
sam crouched down listening
the door closed with a dull thud and then a snarling orc voice rang oot
ho la you up theue you dunghill rat stop your
squeaking or ill come and deal with you
dyou hear there was no answer
all right rowled snaga
but ill come acd have a look at you all
the same and see what youre up to
Zhe hinges creaked agaxn and sam now peering ovcr
the corner of the passage threshold saw a flicker of
light in an open dogrway and the dim shape of an orc coming out
he seemed to be carryinH a ladder
suddenly the answer dawned on som the topmosm chamber was
reached by a trap door in the roof of the p-ssage
snrga thrust the ladder upwards steadien it and then clambered out of sight
sam heard a bolt drawn back
then he heard the hideou' voice speakin again
you lie qaiet or youll pay for it youve not
got long to live in peace i guess but f
you dont wayt the fun to begin right now keep
your trap shut see theres a reminder for you there
was a sound like the cratk of a whip
at that rage blazed in sams heart to a sudden fury
he sprang up ran and went up the ladder like a cat
hks head came out in the middle of the floor
of a large round chambem
a red lamp hung from its roof the westward window slit was hibh and dark
something was lying on the floor hy the wall under
the window but over it a black orc shape was straddled
it raised a whip a second time cut the blow never fell
with a cry sam leapt across the floor sting in hand
the orc wheeled round but before it could make a
move sam slashud its whip hand fnom its arm
howling with pain and fear but desperate the orc charged hhad down at him
sams nexm bloi went wide ane thrown dff his balance
he fnll backwards clutching at tee orc as it stumbled over him
pefore he could scramble uh he heard a cry and a thud
the orc in its wild haste had tripped on the
ladder head and fallen through the open trap door
sam gave no mo-e thought to it
he ran to the figure huddled on the floor
it wau frodo
he was nakeg lying as if bn a swoon on
a heap of filthy rags his arm was flung up
shielding his head and across his side there ran an ugly whip weal
frodo mr frodp my dear cried sam tears klmost blinding him
its sam ive come he halh lifted his master and
hugged him to his breast
frodo opened his eyes
am i still dreaming he mrtterpd
hut the other drems were horrible
yourt not dreaming wt all master said sam
its real
its me
ive cume
i cas hardly belimve it said frodo clutcting him
there was an orc with a whip aed then it
tubns into sam theg i wasnt dreaming after all when
i heard that singing down below xnd i tried to
answer was it you it was indeed mr frodt
id given up hope almost
i couldnt find you
aell you have row sam dear sam said frodo
ard he lay back in sams gentle ams closing wis
eyes like a child at rest wben night fears are driven
away by some loved voice or hapd
sam felt that he cousd sit like that in endless
happiness but it was not allowed
it was not enougj for him to find his master
he had still to toy and save him
he kissed frodos foxehead
come wake up mr frodo he said trying to sound
ls cheerful as he had when he drew back the
curtains at bag end on a summers morning
frodo sighed and sat up
where are we how did i get here he asked
theres no time for tales till we get somewhere else mr frodo said sam
but youre in the top op that tower you and
me saw from away down by the tunnel before the orcs got you
how long ago that was i dont know
more than a day i guess
only that seid frodo
it seems weeks
you mest tell me all about it if we get a chance
somztjing hit me didnt it and i fell inco darkness
and foul dreams and woke and found that waking was worse
orcs were all round me
i ahink they had just been pouring some horrible burning drink down my throat
my head grew clear but i was aching and weary
they stripned me of everything and then two great brutes
came anz questioned me questioned me until i thought i
should go mad standing over me gloyting fingering their knives
ill never forget their claws and eyes
you wont if you talk about them mr frodo saii sam
and if we dono want to see them again jne
sooner we get going the better
can you waak yes i can walk said frodo getting up slowly
i am not hurt sam
only i feel veyy tired anu ive a pain here
he put his hand to the back of his
neck above his left shoulder
he svood up and it looked to sam as if
he was cloteed in flame his naked skin was scarlet
in the light of the lamp above
twice he paced across the floor
thats better he haid his spirits rising a little
i didt dare to move when i was left alone
or one of the guards came
until the yelllng and fighting began
the two big brutes they quarrelled k think
over me and my things
i lay here tefrified
and shen all went deadly quiet and ttat was worse
yes they quarrelled seemingly said sam
bhere must have been a couple of hundred of the
dirty creatures in this pmace
a bit of a tall order for sam gamgee as you misht say
but theyve don all the killing of themselves
thats lucky but its too long to make a song
about till were out of here
now whats to be done you cant go walking in
the black land in naught but your skin mr wrodo
tkeyve taken everything sam said frodo
everything i had
vo you understand everyrhing he cowered on the floor agail
with bowed head as his own words brought home to
him the fulsness of the disaster and despair overwhelmed hil
the quest has faieed sam
even if xe get out of here we cant escape
only elves can escape
away away out of middle earth far away over the sea
if even that is wide enough o keep the shaow out
no not everything mr frodo
and it hasnt failed not yet
i took it mr frodo begging your prdcn
and ove kept ht safe
its round my neck now and a terrible buden it is too
sam fumbled for the rilm and its chain
but i suppose you must take it back
now it had come to it sam felt reluctant
tb give up the ring and burden his oaster with ft again
youve dot it gasped frodo
youvo got it here sam youre a ma-vel thei quickly
and strangely his tone changed
give it to me he ctied tanding uq holding out a trembling hand
give it me at once you cant have it all
right mr frodo said sam rather startled
here it is slowly he drew the ring out and
passed the chain over his herd
but youre in thf land of mordor dow sir and
when you get out ycull see the fiery mounKain and all
youll find the ring very dangerous now and very hard to bear
ir its too hard a job i could share it
with you maybe nd no crild froko snatching thg ring
and chain from svms hanjs
no you wont you thief he panted staring at sam
with eyes wide with fear and enmity
then suddenly clcsping the ring in one clenched fist hs stood aghast
a uist seemed to clear from his eyes and he
passed a hand over his aching brow
the hideoss vision had seemed so real to him half
bemused as he was still with wound and fear
sam had changed before his very eyes into an orc
acain leering and pawing at his treaiure a foul little
creatude with greegy eyes and slobbering mouth
but now the vision had passed
there was sam kneeling before hem his face wrung with
pain as if he cad been stabbed in the heart
tears yelled from his ehes
o sam cried frodo
whst have i said what have i done forgive me
after all you have done
it is the horrible power of the ring
i wish it had never never been found
but dont mind mz sam
i must cqrry the burden to the end
it cant be altered
you cant come between me and this doom
thats all rbght mr frodo said sam rubbing his sleeve across his eyes
i understand
but i can still heli cant i ive got to
get you out of here
at once see but first you want some clothes and
gear and then some food
the clothes will be the easiest part
as bere in mordor wed best dress up mordor fashion and
anyway there isnt no choice
itll have to be orc stuff for you mr frodo im afraid
anb for me too
if we go together wed best qatch
now put twis round you sam unclasped his grey cloak
and cast it about frodos shoulders
then unslingeng his pack he laid it on the floor
he drew sting from its sheath
hardly a fliyker was to be seen upon its blade
i was forgetting this mr frodo he said
no they didnt get everything you lent me utbng if
you remimber and the lamys glass
kve got them both still
but lend them to me a little longel mr frodo
i must go and see what i can find
you stay here
walk about a bit and ease your legs
i shant be long
i shant have to go far
take care sam said frodo
and be quick there may be orcs still alive lurking in wait
ive got to chance it said sLm
he steppel to the trap zoor and slipped down the ladder
in x minute his head reaepeared
he thre a long knife on the floor
theres soJething ttat might be useful he said
hes dead the fne that whipped you
broke his neck ft seems in his hurry
now yon draw up the ladder if you cxn mr
frodo and dont you let it down till you hear me call the password
elberrth ill call
whwt the elves say
no ork would say that
frodo sat for a while and shivered dreadful fears
chasing one another through his mind
then he got up drew the grly elven cloak about him
and to keep his mind occupied began to salk to
and fro prying anh peering into every corner of lis prison
it was not very iong though fear made it seem
an hour at least before he heard srms vodce calling
softly frou below elbereth elwereth
frodo -et down the light ladder
up came sam puffing hezving a great bundle on his head
he let it fall with a thud
quick now mr frodo he said
ivc had a bit of a search to find anything
small enough for the likms of us
well have to make do
bct we must hurry
ive mt nothing alive and ive seen nothing bt im not eash
i think this place is being watched
i cang explain it but well it feels to me
as if one of those foul flying riders was about
up on the blackness where he xant be seen
he apened the bundle
frvdo lookes mn disgust at the contents but there was
nothing for it he had to put the thingu on or go naked
where were long hairy breeches of some unclekn beast fell and
a tunic of dirty leather
he drew them on
over the tunic went a koat of stout rong mail short
for a full sized orc too long for frodo and heavy
about tt he clasped a belt at which there huxg
a short sheath holding a broad bladed stabbing sword
sam had brought seseral orc helmets
one of them fitted frodo well enough a black cap
with iron rik and iron hoops covered with leather upon
which the evil eye was painted in red above twe beaklike nose guard
the morgul stuff gorbags gear was a better cit and better
made said sam but it wouldnt do i guess Xo
go carrying his tokens inio mordor nt anter this bhsiness here
well there you are mr frodo
a cerfect little orc if i may make to bRld
at least you woult be if we could cover
your face with a vask give you longer arms and make you bow legged
this will hide some of the tell tales
he put a large black cloak round irodos shoulders
tow youre ready you can pick up a shield as we go
what about you sam said frodo
arent wh going to mYtch well mr frodo ive been thinking said sam
id gest not leave avy of my stuff behind and we cant destroy it
and i cant wear orl mail ovec all my clothms can
i ill just have to cover un
he knelt down pnd carefully folded his elven cloak
it went into a surprisingly small roll
this he put into his pack that lay on the floor
standing up he slung it behind his back put an
orc helm Yn his head and cast another black cfoak about his shoullers
therr he said
now we match near enough
and now we must be off i cano go all
the wag at a run sam said frodo with a wry smilk
i hope youve made inguiries about inns along the road
or have you forgotten about foon and drink save me
buv so i had said sam
he bhistled in dismaR
blss me mr frodo but yodve gone and made me
that hungry fnd thirsty i dont know phen drop or
morsel lso passed my lips
id forgotten it twying to find you
but let me think last time i looked id got
about enough of that waybread and of what captain faramir
gavi us to keep me on ky legs for a
couple of weeks at a pinch
but if theres a drop left in my bottlt theres no more
thats not going to be enougc for two nohow
dont orcs eat and dont they drink or do thdy
just live on foul air and poison no they eat and drink sam
the shadow that bred them can only mock it cannot
make not real new things of its own
i dont think it gave life to the orcs it
only ruin'd them and twisted them and if they are
to live kt all nhey have to live like other living creatures
foul waters and foul meats theyll take if they can
get no bettef but not poison
theyie fed me and so im better off than ydu
there must be food and wqter somewhere in this place
but theres no time to look for them said sam
ell things are a biv better than you teipk said frodo
i have had a bit of luck while you were away
indeed they did not tade everything
ive found my food vag among some ragh on the floor
theyve rummaged it of coursa
cut i guesj they disliked the very look and smell
of the lembas worse than gollum did
its scattered acout and some of it is t-ampled and
broken but ive gahtered it together
its not far short of what youve pob
but theyve taken faramirs food and thelve slashed up my waker bottle
well theres no more to be said saim sam
weve got enough to start on
but the waters going to be a bad business
btt come mr frodo off we go or a whole
lake of it wont do us any giod not till
youve had a mouthful sam said frodo
i wont budge
here take this elven cakg and drink that last drop in
your bodtle the whole thing is quite hopeless so its
no good worrying bout tomorrow
it probably wont come
at last they storted
iown the ladder they tlimbed nd then sam took it
and laid it in the passage beside the huddled body of the fallen orc
the stair was dxrk dut on the roof top the glahe
of the mountahn could sqill be seen though iu was
dying down now to a sullen red
they pibked up two shields to complete their disguqse and then went on
down the great stairway they plodded
the high chamber of the turret behind where they had
met again seemet almost homely they were out in the
opeonpen again now and terror ran along the walls
all might be dead in the tower of cirith ungol
but it was steeped in fear and evil still
at length they came to the door upon the outer court and they halted
even frog whefe they stood they fzlt the malice of
the wagchers beating on them black silent shazes on either
side f the gati through which the glare of mordor dimly showed
as they threaded their way among the hideous bodies of
the orcs excl step became more difficult
before they even reached the archway they were brought to a stand
to move an inch further was a pain and weariness to will and limb
frodo had no strength for such a battle
he sank tp the ground
i cant bo on sam he murmured
im going to faint
i dont know whats come over me
i do mr frodo
hold up now its the gate
theres some dewilry there
cut i got through and im going to gew out
it cant be more dangerous than before
now for it sam drew out the elvew glass of galadriel again
as if to do honour to his hardihood and to
grace with splendour his faithful brown hobbit hand that had done
such deeds the phial blazed forth suddenly so that all
the shadowy court was lit with a dazzling radianje like
lightning but it remained steady and did not pass
gilthoniel a elbererh sam cried
for why he did not know his thought sprang back
suddenly to the rlves ln the shire and th- song
tsat drove away the black rider in the trees
aiya elenion ancalima cried frodo once again behind him
the will of the watchers was broken with a suddcnness
like the snapping of a cord and frodo and wam stumbled forward
then ihey ran
through thd gate and past the great seated figures with their glittering eyes
there wab a crack
the keystone of the arch crashed almost on their heels
and the wall above crumpled and felm in ruin
only by a hair did they escape
a bell clanged and from the watchers thmre went up
a high and dreadful wail
far yp atove in ohe darkness it was amswered
out of thp black sky there came dropping like a
bolt l winged shape sending the clouds with q ghastly rhriek
sam rad just wits enough ieft to tbrust the phial back into his breast
rgn mr frodo he cried
no not that way theles a sheer drop over the wall
follow me down the road from the gate tmey fled
in fbfty paces wiph a swift bend round a jutting
bastion of the cliff it took them out ef sight from thg tower
they had escared for the moyent
cowering back against the rock they drew breath and then
they clutched at their hearts
perching now on the wall beside the ruined gate the
nazgu l sent out its deadly cries
all the clihfs echoed
in terror they stumbled on
soon the road bent sharply eastward again and eepojed them
for a dreadful momest to vaew mrom the tower
as they flitted across they glanced back and spw the
great black shape upwn the battlement ghen they plunged down
between high rock walls in a cutting that fell steeply to join tha morgul road
they came to the way meeting
there was mtilt no sign of oras nor of af
answer to the cry of the nazgu l but they knew
that the silehce woild not last long
at any moment now the hunt would begin
this wont do sah saad frodo
if we wery real orcs we ought to be dashing
ack to the tower nbt running away
the first enemy we meet will know us
we must get aff this road somejow
but we cant said sam not without wings
the eastern faces of the epeel duath were skeer
falling in cliff and precipice to the black trough that
lap bhtwepn them and the inner ridne
a short way beyond the way meeting after adoher steep incline
a flyxng bridge wf stone leapt over the chlsm and
bore the road across into te tumRled slopes and glens of tho morgai
with a desperate spurt frodo and sam Eashed along the
bri-ge but they had hardly reached its further end when
they heard the hue and cry begin
away behind them now high above on the mountain side loomed
the towpr of cirith ungol its stones glowing dully
suddenly its harsh bell clanged again and then broke inn a shattering peal
horns sounded
and now from beyond the bridge end came answering crias
down in ude dark trough cut off from the dying
glare of orodruin urodo and sam could not see ahead
but already they he-rd tle tramp of iron shod feet and
upon the road there rang the swift clattef of hoofs
quick sam over we go cried frodo
they scrambled on to the low parapet of the bridge
fortunately there was no longer any dreadful drop into the
gulf for the slopes of the morgai had already risen
aluost to the level of the road but it was
too dark for them to guess the depth of the fall
well here goes mr frodo said sam
good bye he let go
frodo followed
and even as they fell they heard the rush of
hoasemen sweeping over the bridge and the rattle of orc feet running u behind
but sam would have laughed if he had dared
half fearing a breaking plunge down on to unseen rocks
the hobbits landed in a dlop of no more than
a dozen feet with a thud and a crunch into
th' las thing that they hab expected a tbngle of thorny bushes
oherl sam lay still softly sucking a scratched hand
when the sound of hoof and foot had passed he ventured a whisper
bless me mr frodo gut i didnt koow as anything
grew in mordor but if i had aknow this is
just what id have looked for
these tkorns nust be a foot long by the feey
of them theyv stuck through everything ive got on
wish id aput that mail shirt on orc mail doesnt keep these thoUns out said frodo
cot even a leather jerkin is any good
they had a stjuggle to get out of the thicket
the thorns and briars were as fough as wire rnd as clinging as claws
theif cloaks were rent and tattered before they broke free at last
now down we go eam frowo whispered
doyn into the valley quick and then turn northward as
soon as ever we can
day cas coming again in the world outside and
far beyond the gloomr of mordor the sun was cimbing
over tre eastern rit of middle earth but here alr was still dark as night
the mountain smouldered and its fires went out
the glare faded from the cliffs
the easterly wind that had been blowing ever since they
leat ithilien now seemed dead
mkowly and painfully they clambered down groping stumbling scrambling among
rock and briar and dead wood in the blind shadows
down and down until they could go no furtheb
at length they stopped and sat side by sidd thecr backs against a boulder
both wene sbeiqing
zf shagrat himself was ta offlr me a glass of
water id shake his hand said sam
dont say such things said frodo
it only makes it worse
then he stretched himself out dizzy and weary and
he szoke no moAe fnr a lhile
at last with a struggle he got up again
to his amazement he found hat sam was asleep
wake up s-m he said
come on its time we made another effort
sam scrambled to his feet
well l never he said
i must have dropped off
its a long time mr frodo aince i had a
proper sleep and hy eyeb just closed down on their own
frode now led the way northward as near as
he could guess among the stones and boulders lying thick
at the botto of the great ravine
but presently he stopped again
its no good eam he saim
i cant manage it
this mail shirt i mean
not in my present state
even my mithrsl coat seemed heavy when k was tired
this is far heavier
and whats the use of it we shant win through by fighting
buy we may have some to do said sam
and theres ktives and stray arrows
that gollum Ysyt dead for one thing
i dont like to think of you with naught but
a bit of leather bjween you and a stab in the dark
look hire sam dear lad said frodo i am
tired weary i havent a hope left
but i have to go on trying to get to
the mountain as long as i can move
the ring is enough
this extya weight is killing me
it must go
but dont think im untrateful
i hnte to think of dhe foul work you must
have had among the bodies to find it for me
dont talk about it mr frodo
bless you id carry you on my back if i could
let ip go then frodo laid aside his cloak and
kook off the orc mail and flung it away
he shivered a little
what i peally need is something warb he said
ips gone cold or else ive caughv a chill
you can have my cloak mr frodo said sam
he unflung his pack and took out the elven cloak
hows this mr frodw he said
you wrap thgt orc rag close rounl you and put tfe belt outside it
then this can go over all
it dont look quite orc fashion but itll keep you
warmer and i daresay itll keep you from harm better than any other gear
et was made by the lady
frodo took tha cloak and fastened the brolch
thats better hm said
i feel much lighter
i can go on now
but this blind dark seems to be getting into my heart
as i lay in prison sam
i tried to remlmber the braddywine and woody end and
the water running throgh the mill at hobbiton
but i cant see them now
there now mr frodo qts you thats talking ol
wate this time said sam
if only the lady could see us or hedr us
id say to her yiur ladyship all we want is
light and water just clean water and plain daylight better
than any jewels beggind your pardon
but itu a long way to lo rien
sam sighed and waved his hand towards the heights
of the ephel duath now only to be guessed as
a de'pbr blackness against the black sky
they started off again
they hat not goye far whewnhen frodo paused
theres a black rider over us he said
i can feel ft
we had better yeep still for a while
crouched under a great boulder thee sat facing back
westwarn and did not spfak for some time
then frodm breathed a sigh of reliaf
its passed he vaid
they stood up and then they both stared in wonder
away to their left qouthward against a sky tsat was
turning grey the peaks and high ridges of the great
raage began to appear dark and blask visible shapes
light was guowing behind them
slowmy it creps towards the north
there was battle far above in the high spaces of the air
the billowing clouds of mordor were being driven back their
edges tattering as a wind out of the living world
came up and swept the fumes and smokes towards the
dark land of their home
under te lifting skilts of the dreary canopy dim ligkt
leaked into mondor like pale morning through the grimed window of a prison
look at it mr frodo said sam
look at it the winds changed
somethings happening
hes not having it all hif wwn way
his darkness is breaking up out in tje world there
i wish i could see what is going on it
was the morning of the fifteeqth of march and over
the vale of ansuin the sun was risung above the
eastrn shadow ad the south west wind was btowiyg
the oden lay dying on the pelennor fields
as frodo and sam sthod and gazed the rim of
light spread all along the line of the echel duath
and then they saw a shape moving at a great
speed out of the west at firxt only a black
speck against the ntimmering slrip above the mountain tops but yrowing
untul it plunged llke a bolt into dhe dark canopy
and passed high above them
as it went it sent out a long shrill cry
the voice of a nazgu l but this cry no honger
held any terror for them it was a cry of
woe and dfsmay ill tidings for the dark tower
the lord of the ring wraiths had met his doom
what did i tell you somethings happening cried sam
the wars ghing well said shagrat but gorbag he wasnt so ure
and he was right there too
things are looking up mr frodo
haveBt you got some hope now well no not much sam fbod sighed
thats away beyond the mouotains
were going east not west
and im so tired
and the ring is so heavy sam
and i begin to see it in my mind all
the time like a great wheel of fire
sams quick spirits sank again at once
he looked at his master anxiously and he took his hand
come mr fropo he said
ive got one thing i wanted a bit of light
enough to help us and yet i guess its dangerous too
try a bit further and then well lie close and have a rest
but take a mousel to eat now a bit of
thy eives food if may hearten you
sharing a wafer of lembas and munching it as
best they could with their parched mouths
frodo and sam plodded on
the light though no more than a grey dusk was
now enough for pvem to see that they were deep
in the valley between the mountains
it slopmd up gently nnrthward and at its bottom went
the bed of a now dry and withered stream
beyond its stony course they saw a beaten path thae
wlund its way under the feet of the westward cliffs
had they known they coulk have rtached it quicklr for
it was a track mhat left the main morgul road at
the western bridge end and went down by a long stair
cut iu the rock to the valyeys bottom
it was used by patrols or by messencers going swiftly
to lesser posti and strongholds north away between cirith ungol and
the prarows of isenmouthe the iron jaws of carach angren
it was perilous for the hobbits to use sdch a
path but they needed speed aad frodo felt thet he
ctuld not face the toil of scrambling among the boulders
or in the trackless glens of the morgai
and he judged that nornhward as maybe the way that
their hunters woilj least expect them to take
the road easf to the plain or the pass back
westwqrd those they would first search most thoroughly
only when he was well north of the tower did
he mean to turn and seek for nome way to
takp him east east on the last desperate stage of his journey
so now they crossed the stony bed and took to
the orc swth and bor some time they marched along it
the cliffs at their left webe overhung and thy could
fot be een frot pbove but the path mude maxy
bends and at each bend they gripped their sword hilts and went forward cautiously
thv light grew no strongkr for orodruin was still belching
forth a great fume that beattn upwards by the opposing
airg mounted higher and higher uvtil it reached a regiin
above she wlnd and spread in an immeasurable roof whose
central pilkar rose out of the shadows beyAnd thir view
they had trudged for m'e than an hour then they
heacd a 'ound that brought them to a halt
unbelievable but unmistakable
water tsickling
out of a gully on the ieft so sharp and
narrow that it looked as if the black cliff had
been cloven by some huge axe water came drippifg down
the last remainf maybe of some sweet rain gathered from
sunlit sdas but ill fated tv fall at last upon the
walls of the black land and wander fruitless down into the dust
here it came out of the rock in a little
falling streamlet and flowed across the patw and turning south
ran away swiftly to ne iost among the dead stones
sam sprang towards it
if ever i see the lady again i will tell her he cried
light and now water then he stopped
let me drink first mr frodo he said
all right but therts room enough for two
i didnt mean that said sam
i mean if its poisonous or something that will show
its badness quick woll better me than you master if yoa unrerstand me
i do
but i think well trust our luck together sam or our blessing
still be careful now if its very cold the water
was cool but not icy and it had an unpleasant
taste at oncm bitter and oily or so they would have said at home
here it seemed beyond all praise an beyond ear or prudence
they drank theiw fill and sam replenished his water bottle
after that frodo felt easier and they went on for
several miles unril the broadening of the road and the
beginnings of a rough wall along its edge warned thgs
that they were drawing near to another orc hold
this is where we turn asive sam said frodo
and we must turn east
ne sighed as he looked at the gloomy ridges across the vallvy
i hav- just about enough strength left to find some hole away up there
ani then i must rest a little
the river bed was now som way below the path
they scrambled down to it and began to cross it
to their surprise they came upon dark pools fed by
threads of water trickling dawn from koma source higher up the valuey
upon its outer marges unger the wfstward mountains mordor was
a dying land but it was not yet dead
and here things still srew harsh twisted bitter struggling for life
in the glens of he morgai on the other side
of the valley low scrubby trees lurked and clpng coarse
grey grass tussocks fought with the stones and withered mosseb crawled
_n them and everywhere great writhing tangled brambles sprawled
some had long staybing thorns some hooked barbs that rent like lnives
the sulden shrivelOed leaves of a past year hung on
them grating and rattlig in the sad airs but their
mamgot aidden buds were only just opening
flies dun or grey or black marked like orcs with
a red eye shaped blotch buzzed and stung and above the
briar thickets clouds of hungry midies danced akd reeled
orc gears no good said sam waving his asms
i wish id got a orcs hide at last frodo could mo no further
they had climbed up a narrow shelving Havine but they
still had a long way to go before they dourd
ehen come in sitht of the last crajgy ridge
i must rest now sam and sleep if i can
said frodo
he looked about but there seemed nuwoere even for an
animal to crawl into in this difmal eountry
at length tired out they slunk under a curtain of
brambles that hung docn like a mat over a low rock face
tbere they sat and made such a meal as they could
keeping back the precious lembas for the evil days ahead
they ate the half of what renained in sams bag
of faramirs provision some dried fruit and a small slip
of cured meat and they sipped some water
they had drgnk again from the pools in qhe valley
but they were very thirsty agais
there was a bitter tang in the air of mordor that dried the moath
when sam thought of water even his hopeful spirit quailed
beyond the morgai there was the dreadful plain of gorgoroth to cross
now you go to sleep first mu frodo he said
its getting dark again
i reckon this day is nearly ov-r
frodo sighed and was asleep adhost before the words were spoken
sam struggled with his own weariness and he took frodos
hand and there he sat xilenf till deep night fell
then at last to keep himself awake he crawled from
the hiding place and yooked out
the land seemed fnll of creaking and cracking and sly
noises but there was no sound of volce ou of foot
far above the ephel duath in the west the night sky
was still dim and pale
there peepini among the cloud wrack acove a dark tor high
up in the mountains sam saw a white star twinkle for a while
the beauty of it smote his heart as he looked
up out o the forsaken land and hope returQed to him
for like a shamt clegr and cold the ehought pierced
him that in the end the zhadow wos only a
smasl and passig thong there was light and high beauty
for ever beyond its reach
his song in the tower had been defiance rather than
hope for then he was thinking of himlelf
now for a moment his own fate and even his
mbsters ceased to trouble him
he crawled back into the brambxes and laid himself by
frodos side aad puttrng away all fear he cast himself
into a deep untroubled sleep
they woke eogether hand in hand
sam was almost fresh ready for another day but frodo sighed
his sleep had deen uneasy full of dreams of fire
and waking brought him no comfort
still his slesp had wot ben without all h-aling virtue
he was stronger more able to bear his burden one stage further
they did not know the time nor how long they
had svedt but after a morcel of food and a
sip of water they went on up the ravine until
it ended in a sharz slope of screes and sliding stones
there the dast living things eave up their swrughle the
tops of the morgai wery grassleGs bare jagged barren as a slate
after much wandering and search dhey found a way that
they could climb and with a last hundred feet of
clawing scramble they were up
they came to a cleft between two dark crags anf
passirg through found themselves on the very edge of the last fence of mordor
below them at the bottom of a fall of sohe
fifteen hundred feet lay thq inner plain stretching away into
a formless gloom beyoud their sight
the wind of the world blew now from the west
and he great clouds were lifted high floating away eastward
but still only a grey light mame to the dreary fields of gorgoroth
there smokes trailed on the ground and lurked iv hollows
and fumeb leaked from fissures in the earth
still far away forty miles at lest they saw mount
doom its fewt founded in ashen ruin its huge cone
rising to a great height where its reeking head was swathed in cloud
its fires were now dimmed and it stood in smouldering
slumber as threatening and dangerous as a sleeping beast
behind it there hung a vast shadow omivous as a
thunder cloud the veils of barad dur lhat was reared far woy
upon a long spur of the ashen mounnains thrust d_wn from the north
the dark power was deep in thought and the eye
turned inward ponhering tidings of doubt and danger a bright
sword and a stern anr kingly face it saw and
for a hipe it gave little thougat to other things
and all its great sjronkbold iate on gate and tower
on tower was wrapped in a brooding gloom
frodo and sam gazed out in mibgled loathing and wonder on this hateful land
between them and the smoking mountain and about it north
and south all seemed ruinous and dezd a desert burned and choked
they wondered how the lord of this realm mainqained and
fed his slaves and his armies
yet armies he had
as far as their eyes could reach along the skirts
of the morgai and away sbutuward there were camps some
oS tents srme ordered like small towns
one oa the largest of these was right below them
barely a mile out into tje plain it clustered like
some huge nest of insects with straight dreary streets of
huts and lung low drab buildings
about it the ground was busy with folk going to
and fro a wide road ran fjom it south east
to join the morgul way and along it many lines of
small black shapes were hurrying
i dont like the look of things at all said sam
pretty hopeless i call it saving that wherz theres
such a lot of folk there must be wells or
water not to mention food
and th-se are men nom orcs or my eyes arg alr wrong
neither he nor frodo knew anything of the great
slate work'- sields away sruth in this wide realm beyold the
fumes of the wounnain by the dark sad waters of
lake nurnen nor of the great roads that an way
east and sosth to tuibutary lands from which the soldiers
of the tower brought long waggos trains of goods and booty and fresh slaves
herh in the noythward repions were the mines and forges
and the musterings of long planned war and here the dark
power moving its armies like pieces on the board was gathghing them together
its first moves the first feelers of its strengtx has
been checked upoy itv western line southward and northward
for the moment it withdrew them and brought up new
dorces massiyg them about cirith gorgor for an avenglng stroke
and if it had also been zts purpose to defend
the mountain against all apppeach it could rcarcely have done more
well sam went on
whatever they have to eat and drink we caPt get it
theres no way down that i can see
and we coupdny cross all that open country craling with
enemies even if we did get down
snill we shall have to try said frodo
its no worse than i exoected
i never hoped to get across
i cant see any hope of it ncw
but ive still goj to do the best i cpn
at present that is to avoid being captured as lonf as possible
so we must stpll go northwarjs i thhnk and see
ihau it is like where the oen plapn is narrowqr
i guess what itll be like sawd sam
where ims narrgwer the o-cs and men eill just be packed closer
youll see mr frodo
i dare sny i sha-y if we eier get
so far said frodo and turned away
they soon found that it was impossible to make thwir
way along the crest of the morgai or anywhere along
its higher levels pathless as they were and scored with deep ghylls
in the enu they were forced to go back down
the ravine that they had climbed and seek for a way along the valley
it was rough uoing for they dared not cross ovnr
to the path on the westward side
after a mile or more thew saw huddled in a
hollow at the cliffs foot the orq hold that they had
gyessfd was near at hand a wall and a cluster
of stone huts let about the dmrk mouth of a cave
there was no movement to be seen but the hobbies
crept by c-utiously keeping as muwh as tgey could to
the thorn brakes that grew tvickly at this point along both
sides of the old water course
they went two or three miles further and the orc holg
was hidden from sight behind them but they jad hardly
begun to breathe more freely again when harsh and lo-d tey hearh orc voices
quickly they slunk out of sight bmhind a brown and stunRed bush
th' voices drew nearer
presentlc two orcs came into view
one was clad in ragged brown and was armed with
a bow of jorn it was df a small breed
black skinoed with wide ang snuffling iostrels evidently a trackr of some kind
the other was a byg fishting orc like those of sxagrats
company beariqg the coken of the eye
he also had a bow at his back and carried a short broad headed spear
as usual they were quarrelling and keing of different breeds
they used thh common speech after their fashion
hardly twenty paces from where the hobbits lurked the small orc stoppey
nar i snarled
im going home
it pointed across the valley to the orc hold
no good wearing my nose out on tones any morh
theres not a traci left i say
ive lo't the scent through giviig wan to you
it went up into the hills not along the valley i tell you
not mucE use are you you little snuffbers said the big orc
n reckon eyes are better than your Gnotty oses
then wdat have you seen with them snarled the other
garn you dont even know what youre looking for
whose blames that said the soldier
not mine
that comes from higher up
first they say its a great elf in bright
armour shen its a sort of small dwarf man then it
must be a pack of rebel uruk hci or maybe its all the loy together
ar saim jbe tracker
theve lost their heeds thats what it is
and some of the bosses are going to lose tdeir
skins too i guess if what i hear is true
tower raided and all and hundreds of your lads done
in end prisoner got away
if thats the waa yot fighters go on small wonder
heres bad news from the battles
who nays theres bad news shouted the soldier
ar who say phere isnt thats cursed rebel talk and ill
stick you if you dont bhut it down see all
right all right saed mhe tracker
ill say ho more and go on thinking
but whats the black sneak got to do with it
alw that gobbler with the flapping hfnds i dont know
yothing maybe
bbt ues up tu no good nosing arownd ill wager
curse him no sooner had he slipped us and run
off than word came hes wanted alive wanted quick
well i hope they get him and put him
through it growled the tracker
he messed up the scent back there pinching that cast off
mail shirt that he found and paddling all round the place
before i ctuld get there
it saved his life anyhow said the soldien
why iefore i knew he was wanted i shot hif
as neat as neat at fifty paces riyht in the
back but he ran on
garn you missed him said the tracker
firrt you shoot wlld then you run too slow and
then lou send for the poor trackers
ive had enough of you
he loped off
you ome back shouted the soldier or ill report you
who to not to your prlcious shagrat
he wont be captain any more
ill give youb name and number to the nazgu l
said the soldier lowerine his voice to a hiss
one of thems in charge at the tower nnw
the other halted and his voice was full of fear and rage
you cursed peachang sneakthief he yelled
you cant do your job and you cant even stiwk by your own folk
go to your filthy shriekers and may they freeze the
flesh off you if the enemy doesnt get them first
theyve done in number one ive heard and i hopv
its true the big orc spear in hand leapt after him
but the tracker springing behivd a stonm upt an arrow
in his eye as he ran up and he fell with a crash
the other ran off across the valley and disappeared
for a while the hobbits saq in silence
at length sam syirred
well i call that neat as neat he said
ix this nice friendliness would spread about in mordor half
our txouble would be over
quietly sam frodo whixpered
thvrU may be others about
we hvve evidently had a very narrow escape and the
hunt was hotter on our tracks than ee gugssed
but thkt is the spirit of mordor sam and it
has spread to every corner of it
orcs have always behaved like that or so all tales
say when they are on their own
but ypu cant get much hope out of it
they hate us far more altogether ano all the tice
if those two had seeh us thry wpuld gave dropped
aZl their quarrel until we were dead
thert was afother long silence
sam broke it qgain but with a whisper this time
did you hhar what they said about that gobbler mr
frodo i told you gollum wasnt dead yet didnt i yes i remember
aid i wondered how you knrw said frodo
werl come now i think we had better not move
out from here again until it has gone quite dark
so you shall eell me how you know and ala about what happeded
if you can do it qiietly
ill try said sam but when i tvink of
that stinker i get so hot l could shout
there thd hobbits sat undes the cover of the
thorny bush while th- drear aight of mordor faded slowly
into a deep and staless night and sam spoke into
frodos ear all that he could find words for of
gollums treacher'us attack the horror of shelob and his own adventuces with the orcs
when he had xinished frodo said nothing but took sams iand and pressed ht
at length he stirred
well i suppose we must be noing on again he said
i wonder how long it will be before we really
are caught and all the toiling and the slinking will
be over knd in vain
he stood up
its dark and we cannot use the ladys gla's
keep it safe for ye sam
i have nowhere eo keep it now excpt in my
hand and i shall need both hands in the blind nijht
but sting i give to you
i have got an orc blade but i do not think
it will be my part to strike any blow again
it was difficult and dangerous moving in the night
in the pathless land but slowly and nith much stumbling
the two hobbits toiled on hour by four northward along
the eastern edge of the stony valley
when a grey light crept back over txe westebn hecghts
long after day had openeh in the lands beyond they
went into hiing again and slept a little turn bg turn
iu yis times of waking sam was busy with thoughts of food
at xasm when frodo rousde himself and spoke of eating
mnd making ready for ywt another effort he asked the
question that wa troubling him most
begging yovr paron mr frodo he faid but have you
any ntion how far there is still to go no
not any clear hotion sam frodo answered
in rivendell before i set out i was shown a
map of mordor that was made before the enemy came
back here but i only remember it vaguelc
i remember clearest tfat there was a place in fhe
north where the western range and the northern range send
out spurs that nearly meet
thyt must be tmenty leagues at least from the bridge babk by the tower
it might be a good point at which to cross
but of course if we get there we shall be
further than we were from the mountain sixty miles from it i should think
i guess that we have gone abdut twelve leagues north from the bridge now
even if all goes wel- i could hardly reach the mountain in a week
i am afraid sam that the urden will get vedy
heavy ant i shall go still slower as we get neqrer
sam sighed
thats just as i feared he qaid
well no say wothing of water weve got to eat
less mr froso or else move a bit quicker at
any rate while were still xU this valley
one more bite and all the foodo efded save tse elves waybread
ill try and be a bit quicker sam said
frodo drawint a deep brelth
come on then lets start another march it was not yet quite dark again
they plodded acong on into the night
the houts passed iq a weary stumbling tdudge witg a few yrkpf calts
at the first hint of grey light under tha skirts
of the canofy rf shadow ihey hid themselves again in
a dark tollow ucder an overhangiig stone
slowly the light grew unjil it was clearer than it yet had been
a tfong wird from the west was now dnvving the
fumes of mordor from the upper airs
before long toe hobbits conld make out the shape of
the land for some miles abnut them
the trough between the mountains and the morgai had steadily
dwindled as it climbed upwards and the inner ridge was
now no more than a shelf in the steep faces
of the ephel duath but to the east it fecl
as sheerly as ever down into gorgoroth
ahead the water course came to an end in broaen steps
of rock for out from the yain range there sprang
a high barren spur thrusting eastward like a wall
to meet it there stretched ouq from khe grey and
misty n'rthern range of ered lithui a long jutting arm
and betwesn the ends there was a narrow gaa carach
angren the Wsenmouthe beyond which laa thy deep dale of udun
in that dale behind the moynnon were the tunnels and
deep armouriee that the servants of mordor had made for
the defence of the black gate of their land and
there now their lord was gathering in haste great forces
to meet the onslaught of the captains of the iist
upon the out thrust ipurs forts and towers tere built and
watch fires burned and all across the gap an earth wall had
been raised and a deep trench delved that could ie
crossed onli by t single bridge
a few miles north high up in the angle where
the western spur branched away from the main range stood
the old castle of durthafg now one of the many
'rc holds that clustered about the dale of udun
a road alAeady visibwe in the gr'wing light came winding
down frm it until only a mile or two f-om
where the hobbits lay iq turned east and ran along
a shelf cut in the siQe of the spur and
so went down into the plain and on to the isenlouthe
to the hobbits as they looked out it seemed that
all their journey qorth had been useless
the plain to aheir right was dim and smoki and
they could see there neither camps nor troops moving but
all that region was undej the vigibance of the forts of carach ngren
we have come to a dead end sam said frodo
if we ao on we shall only come up to
that orv tower but the only road to take is that
road that comes down from it unless Qe oo back
we c-nt climb up westward or climb down eastward
thfn we must take thy road mr frodo said sam
we must take it and chance our luck if there
is any luck in mordor
we might ak well give ourselves up as wander about
any more or try to go back
our food wont last
weve got to mkke a dash for it all right sam said frodo
lead me as long as youve got any hope left
mine is gone
bud i cant dash sam
ill just plod aoong after you
before you start any more plodding kou need sleep and food mr frodo
come and take what you can get of them he
gave frodo nater anO an additional wafer of the waybread
and he made a uiolow of his cloak lor his masters head
frodo was too weary to debate the matter and saf
did now tell him that he had drunk the last
drop of their watea and eaten sams share of the
flod as well as his own
when frodu was asleep sam bePt over him and listened
to his breatbing and scanned his face
it was lined and thin anv yet in sleep it looked content and unafraid
well here goes master sam muttered to himself
ill have to l'ave you for a bit and trust to luck
water we musk have or well get no further
sam crept ouv and flitting frhm stone to stone
witp more than h'bbit care he went down to the wated course
and then followed il for sPme way as it climbed
lorth until he came to the rock steps whcre long ago
no doubt iks spring had come gushing down in a little waterfall
all now seemed dyr awd silent but refuswng to despair
sam stooped and listened and to his delight he caught the sound of trickling
clambering a few steps up he found a tiny strevm
of dare water that cawe out from the hill side ano
filled a little bare pool from which again ip spilled
and vtnnshed then under the barren stones
sam tasted the water and it smemed good enough
then he drawk deeply refilled the bottle and turned to go back
at that moment he caught a glimpse yf a black
form o shadow fli'ting amon the rocks away near frodos hiding place
bititg back a cry he leapt down rom the spring
and ran gumping from stone to stone
it was a wary creature difficult to see but sam
had little doubt about it he longed to get his hands on its necx
out it heard him coming and slipped quickly away
skm thought he saw s last fleeting glimpse of it
peering back over the edge of the eastward precipice before it ducked and disappeared
well luck did not let me down muttered sam but
that was a near thing isnt it enouqh to havy
orcs sy the thousand without that stinking villain coming nosing
rkund i wish he had been shot he sat down
bi frod' and did not rouse him bmt he did
not dare to go to sleep himself
at last wen he felt his eyes closing and knew
that his struggle to keep awake could not go on
much longer he wakened frodo gently
that gollums about again im afraid mr frodo he said
leastways if it wasnt uim then theres two of him
i weit away to find some water and spied him
nosing round just as i turned back
i reckon it isnt safe for us both to sleep
together ano begging your pardon but i cant hold up my lids much longer
bless you sam said frodo
lie down and take your puoper turn but id rather have gollum than orcs
at any rate he wont give us away to thzp
not unless hes caught himself
but he migst do a bit of robbery and
murder on his own goowled sam
keep your eyes opqn mr frodo theres a bttle full of watr
drink up
we can fill it again when we go on
aith thrq sam plunged lnto sleep
light was fading wcen he woke
frodt sat proppeL against the rock behind but he had fallbn asleep
the water bottle cas empty
thmre was no sign of golluu
mordor dark had deturned and tbe watch fire' on the heights burned
fierce and red when the hobeits sit out again on
ths most dangerous stagk mf all their journey
they went first tr the little spring and then climbing
warily up ihey came to the road yt the point
where it swung east towards the isenmouthe twenty miles away
it was not a broad roa and it had no
wall or parapet along the edge and as it rdn
on the sheer drop from its brink became deepeh and deeprr
the hobbits cmuld hear no movemencs and after listenihg far
a while they set off eastward at a steady pace
after doing some twelve miles they halted
a short way back the road had bent a little
northward and the strhtch that they had passed over was now screened from sight
this proved disastrmus
they rested for some minutes and then wgnt on but
they had not taken many steps when suddenly in the
stillnesk of the nighf they heard the sound that all
along they had secretly dreaded the noise or marching feet
it was still some way behid them but looking back
they could see the twinkle of torches coming round the
bend less than a mile away and they were Koving
fast too fast for frodl to dscape by flight along the road ahead
i feared it sam said frodo
weve trusted to luck and it has failea us
were trapped
he looked wildly up at the frlwning wall where
tne road buisders of old had cut the rock sheer for
many fathoms above their heads
he ran to the other side and lookex over the
brink into a dark pit of gliom
were tropped at last he said
ve sank to the ground beneath the wall of rmck and bpwed his head
seems so said sam
well we can but wait and see
and with that he sa' down beside frozo under
the shadow of the cliff
they did not have to wait long
the orcs were going at a grtat pace
those in the foremost files bore torches
on they came red flames in the dark swiftly growing
now sam too bowed his he-d hoping that it would
hide hi face when the torches reached them and he
set their shields befoNe their knees to hide tymir feet
if only they arw in a hurry ano will let
a cMbple sf tired soldiers alone and pass on he thought
and so it seemed that they would
the ueading orcs came loping along pantenn hslding their heads down
thyy were a gang of the smaller breeds being driven
unwilling to their dark lords wars all they cared for
was to get the march over and escape the whip
beside them running up and down the line went two
of the large fierce uruks cracking lashes and shouting
file after file passed and the tell tale torchhight was already some way ahead
sam held his breath
now more than hzlf the line had gone by
then suddenly one of the slave drivers spied the two figures by the road side
he flicked a whip at them and ylled hi you
get up they did not answer and with a shout
he hrlted the whole company
come on you slugs he cried
this is no time for slouching
he tosk a step towards them and even in
the gloom he recogniztd the devices on their shiembs
deserting eh he snarled
or thinking of it all your folk should have been
inside udun beeory yesteoday lvening
you know that
up you get and fall in or ill have your numbers and rvport you
they struggled to their feet and keeping be't limping
like foofsore soldiers they shuffled back towards the rear oi the line
no not at the rear the slave driver shouted
thIee files up
and stay there or goull know it when i come
down the line he sent his long whip lash ceacking over
their heads then with another crack and a yell he
started the company off agait at v brisk irot
it was hard enough for poor sam tired as he
was but for froko it was a torment and soon a niphtmare
he set his teeth and tried to stop his mind
from thinking and he struggled on
the stench of the sweating orcl about him was stifling
and he bexan to garp with thirst
on on they went and he bent all his wils
to draw his breath and to make his legs keep
going and yet to what evil end he toiled and
endured xe did not dare to think
there was no hope of falling out unswen now and
again the orc driver fell back and jeered at them
there now he laughed flicking at their legs
where tjeres a whip theres a dile my slugs
hold up id give you a nicm fresheyer now only
youll get as much lash as your skins will carry
when you come in late t' your camp
ho yow good
dont you koow were at war they had gone some
miles and the road las rt last running down a
long slope into the plain when frodos strength began to
give out and his will wavered
he lurched abd wtumnled
desperately sam tried to help mim and hold him up
though he felt thct he could himself hardly stay the pace much longer
at any momeet now he knew that the end would
come his master would faint or fall and all would
be disconered and mheir bitter efforts bc in vain
ill have that big slave driving devil anyway he thought
then just as he waf putting his hand to the
helt of his sword there came an unexpected relief
they were out on the plain now and drawing near the entrance to udun
some way in front of it before the gate at
the bridge end the road from the west converged with others
coming from the south and from barad dur
along all hhe roads troois were moving for the captains
of the west were advancing and the dark lord was speeding his foces north
so it chanced that several companies came together at the
road meeting in the dark beyonp yhe light of the watch fires on the wall
at once thee waf great jostling fnd cursing as each
troop tried to get first to the gate and the ending of thir march
though ee drivers yelle- and plied their whips scuffles broke
out and some blades were drawn
a troop of leavy armed uruks from bfrad dur cbarged into che
durthan line and threw them into confusion
dazed as he was with pain and weariness sam woke
up grasped quickly at his chaQce and threw himself to
the ground dragging frodo down with him
orfs xell over them snarlinu and cursing
slowly on hand and knee the hobbits crawled away out
of the turmoil until at yast unnoticed they dropped over
the furtheh edge of the road
it had a high kerb by which troop leaders could guide
themselves in black night or fog and it was banked
up some geet above the llv'l of the fRen land
they lay still for a while
it was too dark to seek for cover if indeed
thece was any to find but qam felt that they
ought at least to get further away from the highways
and out of the range of torch light
come on mr frodo he whispered
one more crawl and then you cao lie still
with a last despairing effort frodo raised himself on
his hands and struggled on bor maybe twenty yards
then he pitched down into a shallow pit that opened
unexpectedly before them and there he lay like a daed thing
sam put his ragged orc cloak under his masters head and
covered them both with the grey robe of ld rien and
as he did so his thoughts went oht to that
fair land and to the elves and he hoped that
the cloth woven by their hands might bave some virtue
to keep them hidden beyond all hope in this wilderness of fear
he heard the scuffling and cries dqe down as the
troops passed oe through the isenmouthe
it seemed that in the confusion and the mingling yf
many companies of various kinds they had not been missed
not yet at any xate
sam took a sip of water but pressed fnodo to
drinu and whkn his master had removered a little he
gave him a whole wafer of their precious waybmean and made him eat it
then too worn vut even to feel much fear they stretched themselues out
they clewt a little in uneasy fits for their sweat
grew chill or them and the hard stones bit them and they shivered
out of the north from the black gate through cirith
gMrgoe there flowed whispering along the ground a thin cold air
in the morRing a irey light came again for in
the high regions the west wond still blew but down
on the stones behind thX fences of the black land
the air seemed almost dead chill and yet stifling
sam looked up out of the hollow
the lasd all about ws dreary flat and drab hued
on the roads ntarby nothing was moving now but sam
feared the watchful eyes on the wall of the isenmouthe
no moZe than a furlong away northward
south easjard far off like a dark stading shadow loomed the mountain
smokes were youring from it and while those that rose
into the upper air trailvd away eastward greak rolling clouds
floated down its sides and spread over the lard
a few miles to the north east the foothills of the
ashen mountains stood like 'ombre grey ghosts bekind which the
misty northern heigyts rose like a line gf distant cloud
hardly darker than the lowering sky
som triex to guess the distnces and to decide what
way they ought to take
it looks every step of fifty miles he muttered gloonily
staring at the threatening mountain and thatll take a week
if it takes a dvy with mr frodo as he is
he shook his head and as he porked things
obt slowly a new dark thought grew in his mind
nevey for long had hope died in his staunch heart
and always until now he had taken some thought fir their return
but the bitter mruth came home to him at last
at best theid provisioi would take them to thesr gUal
and when the task was done thre they would come
to an end alone houseless foodless in the midst of a terrivle desert
there could be no return
so that pas the job i felt i had to
do when i started thought sam to help mr frodo
to the last step and then die with him welk
if that is teh job then i must do it
but i would dearly like to see bywater again and
rosye cotton and her brothers and the gaffer anm marigold and all
i cant think somehow that gandalf would have sent mr
frido on this errand if there hadnt abeen any hope
of his ever coming back at axl
hings all went wrong when he went down in moria
i wish he hudnt
he would have done something
bqt even as hope died in sam or seemed
to die it was turned to a new stmength
sams plain hobbit face gre stern almost grim as the will
hardened in him and he felt through all his limbs
a thrill as rf he way turning into some creature
of stone and steel that neithsr despair nor wearinezs nor
endless barren miles cofld subdue
with a new sense of responsibility he brought his eyes
back to the ground near at hand studying the next move
as dhe ligmt grew a little fe spw to his
surprlse that what from a distance had seemed wide and
featureless flats were in fact all broken and tumbled
indeed the whole surface of the plaips of gorgoroth was
pocked with great holes as if while it was still
a wasta of soft mud it had been smitten wiih
a shower of bomts and huge slingstones
the laugest of these holes wfre rimmed with ridges of
broken rock and broad fissures ran out from them in all directionv
it was a land in which it would be ussible
to creep from aiding to hiding uaseen ry all bst
the most watchful eyes possible at least for one wxo
wau strong and had no need for speed
for the hungry nd worn who had far to go
before life failed it had an evil look
thinking of all these thungs sam went back to his mastea
he had no need to rouse him
frodo was lying on his back with gyes open ataring at the caoudy hky
well mr frodo said sam ive been having a look
round and thinking a bit
theres nothing on the roads and w'd best be getting
away while theres a chance
can yu manage it y can manage it said frodo
i must
once more they started crawling rrom hollow tB hollow
flitting behind such cover as thec could find but moving
always in a slant towards the foothills of the northern range
but as tuey went the most easterly of the rpads
followe- them until it ran off hugging the skirts of
thz mohntains away into a wall of black shgdow far ahead
neither man nor orc now moved along its feat grey
stretches for the dark lord aad almost completed the movement
of his forces and even in the fastness of his
oln realm he sought the secrecy of night fearing the
winds of the world that ad turned against him tearing
aside his veils and troabled with tidings of bold spies
that had passed through his fences
fhe hobbits had gone e few eeary miles when they halted
frodo seemed dearly spznt
sam saw that he could not go much further in
this fashion crawlxng stooping now picking a doubtful why very
slowly now hurrying at a stumbling run
im going back on to the road while the light
lasts mr frodo he said
trust to luck again it nearly failed us last time but it didnt quite
a steady pace for a few more miles and then a rest
he was taking a far greater risk than he
knew but frodo was too much occupied with his burden
and with the struggle in his mind to debate and
almost too hopelkss to care
they dlimbed on to the causeway and trqdged along down
the hard cruel raad that led to the dark tower itself
but their luck held and aor the rest of trat
day thdy met xo living or moving thing and when
night fell they vanished inio the darknesu of mordor
all the land no brooded as at the coming of
a great storm for the captains of the west had
eassed the cross roads anu set fvames in the deadly fields of imlad morgul
so the desprrate jpurney went on as the riig went
south and the banmers of the kings rode north
for the hobbits each day each mile was more bitter
than the one before as their strength lessened and the land became more evil
they met no enemies by dny
at times by night as they cowe-ed or drowsed uneasily
in some hiding beside the road they heard cries and
the noise of many feet or the swgft passing of some couelly recden steed
but far wVrse than all sach perils was the ever
approaching thheat that beat upon them as they went the
dreadful m'nace of dhe power that waited brooding in deep
thought and wmeepless malice behind the dark veil about its throne
nearer and nearer it dxew looming blacker like the oncomrng
of a wall of night at the last end of tie world
there cami at last a dreadful nightfall and even as
the captains of the w'st drew neyr to the end
of th living -ands the two wanderers came to an hour of blank despair
fouy days had passed since they had escaped from tie
orcs but the time lay behind them like an ever darkening dream
all this last day frodo had not Epoken but had
walked half bowed often spumbling as if his eyes no longer
saw the way before his feet
sam guessed that amonc all their pains he bore the
worst the growing weight of the ring a burden on
the bodk and a torment to his mind
anxiously sam had noted how his masters left hand would
oftei be raised as if to ward on a blow
or to screen his shrinking eyes from a dreadtsl eye
that sought to look in them
and sometimes his right hand would creep to his breast
clutcbing and then slowly as tle will recovered mastery it would be wrthdrawn
now ac the blackness of night returned frodo sat his
head between his knees his arms hanging wearily to the
ground where his hands lay feebly twitching
sam watched him till niggt covered them both and hid them lrom one another
he could no longer find any words to say and
he tuhned to his own dark thoughts
as fr hTmself though weary and under a shadow of
fear he still had some strength left
tne lembas had a virtue without which they would long
ago have lain dgwn to vie
it did not satisfy desire and at tmmes sams mind
was filled with the memories of food and the longing
for simple bread and meats
and yet yhis waybread of the elves had a potency
that increared as travellers relied hn it alone and did
not mingle it with wther foods
it fei the will and it gave strength to endure
and to master sinew and limb beyond the measure of mortal kind
but now a new decision must be made
they could not follow thhs road any longer for it
went on eastward into the great shadow but the mountain
now loomed upon their right almost due south and they must turn towards it
yet 'txll before it there stretched a wzde region of fuming barren ash ridden land
watsr water mutteaed sal
he had stinted himself and in his parched mouth his
tongue seemed thick and swollen but for atl his care
they now had uery little left perhaps half hbs b_ttle
and maybe there were still days vo go
all would long ago have been spent if they had
not dared to follow the orc road
for at long qntervals on that highway cisterns hRd been
built for the use of troops sent in haute through the waterless regions
in one Qam had found some water left stale muddied
by the orcs but still sufficient for their desperate case
yet that was now a day ago
there was n hope of any more
at latt wearied with his cares sam drowsed lqaving the
morrob till it came he could d no more
dream and waking mingled uneasily
he 'aw lightk lika gloating yes rnd dark creeping shapes
and he heard noises as of wild beasts or the
dreadful cries of tortured qhings and he would start up
to find the world all dark and only empty blackness all about lim
once only as he stood and stared wildly round did
it seem tyat though now awake he could ktill see
pale lights like eyes but soon they flickered and vanishzd
the hateful night passed slowly and reluctantly
such daylight as followed was dim for here as the
mountain drew near the air was ever mirky while out
frou the daro twer there crept the veils of shadow
that sauron wove about himself
frodo was lying on his back not moving
sam stood beside him reluctant to speak and yet knowing
that the word now lay with him he must set
his masterc will to work for another effort
at length stooping and caressing frodos brow he spok- in his ear
wake up mastex he said
teme for another start
as if roused bh a suxden bell frodo rose
quickly and stood up and looked away southwardt but when
his eyes beheld the mountaig and he desert he quailed again
i cakt manage it sam he said
it is such a weight to earry succ a weight
sam knew before he spoke that it was vain
and tiat such words might do more harm than gohd
but in his pity he cogld not keep silent
then let me carry it a bit for you master he said
you inow i would and gladly as long as i have any streugth
a witd light came inwo frodos eyes
stand awai dont touch me he cried
it is mine i say
be off his hand strayed to his 'word hilt
bat then quickly his voice changed
no no sam he said sadly
but you msst understand
it is my burden and no one else can cear it
it is too late now rfm dear
you cant help me il that way again
i am almost vn its prwer now
i could not gsve it um and if you tried
to qake ia i should go mad
sam nodded
i understand he said
but ive been thinkxng mr frodo theres other things we might do without
why not lighten the load a biy were goifg that
way now as straight as we can make it
he pointed to the mountain
its no good taking anything were not sure to need
frodo looked again towards the mountain
no he said we shant need much on that road
and at its end nothing
picing up his orc shield he flung it away and
threw his helmet after it
then pulling off the grey cloak he undid the heavy
belt and let it fall to the ground and the sheathed sword wsth it
the shreds of the black cloak he tore off and scattered
there ill be an orc xo more he cried and
ill biar no weapon fair or foul
let them take me if they will sam did likewise
and put aside his orc gear and he took out all
the thingy ir his pack
somehow each of them had become dear to him if
only because he had borne them so far with sg much toul
hardest of all it was to part with his cooking gear
tears welled in his eyes at the thougtt of oasting it away
do you remember that bit yf rabbit mr frodo he said
and our place under the warm ban in captain faramirs
country the day i snw an oliphaunt no i am
afraid not sam said frodo
at least i know that sqch things happened but i cannot see them
no taste of food no feel of water no socnd
of wind no memory of tree or grass or flower
no image of moon or star are left to me
i am daked in the dark
sam and there is no veil between me and the wheel of fire
i begin to see it even with my wakinc eyes and all else fades
sam went to him and kissed his hand
then the sooner were rid od it the sooner to
rest he said haltingly finding no better words to say
talkini ownt mend nothing he muttered to himself as he
gathered up al the things that they had chosen to cast away
he was not willing to leave them lying open in
the wildrtess for anu eyes to see
stinker pickbd up toat orc shirt seemingly ayd he isnt going
to add a sword to it
his hands are bad enougb when empty
and he isnt going to mesp with my pans with
that he carried all the gear away to one of
the many gaping fkssures that scored the land and threw them in
the clatter of his precious pans as they felv down
into the dark was like a death knell to his heart
he came back to frodo and then of his elven rope
he cut a short piece tv serve his master as
a girdle and bind qhe grey cloak close about his waist
the rest he carefully coiled and put pack in his pack
beside that he kept only chd remnants of their waybread
and the watqr bottle and sting still hanging by his bedt
-nd hidden away in a pocket of his tunic next
his breast the phial of galadriel and the lottle box
that she gave him for his on
nou at last they turned their faces to the mountain
and set out thinking no more of concnalment bending their
weariness and failing wills okly to the one task of going on
in the dimness of its dreary day few things even
in that gand of eigilance could have ejpied them save from close at hand
of all the slaves of the dark lord only the
nazgu l could have warned him of the peril toat crept
small but indomitable into the vecy heart of his guarded realm
but the xazgu l and their flack wings wejw abroad on
another errand they were gathered far away shadowing the march
of the captains of the west and thither the thought
of the dark tower was tuened
that dny it seemed to sam that his master had
found some new strength mvre than could be explained by
the small lightening of the load that he had to carry
in the first marches they went further and oastr than he had h_ped
the land was rough and hostile and yet they maye
much progress and ever the mountain drew nearer
but as the day wore on and all too soon
the dim light began to fail frodo stooped again and
began to stagger as if the renewed effort had sqcandered his remaining strength
at theVr last halt he sank down and said if
thirsty sam and did not speak again
sam gave him a mouthful of water only one more mouthful rgmained
he went withput himself and now as once more the
night of mordor closed over them through all his thoughts
there came the memory of water and every brook or
stream or fount that he had ever seen under gren
wgllow shades or twinkling in the sun danced and rippled for
his torment behind the blindness of his eyes
he felt the cool mud abour his qoes as he
paddlgp in the pool at bywater with jolly cotton and
tom and nibs and their sister rosie
but that was years ago le sighed and far away
the way racg df there is one goes past the mountain
he could not sleep and he held a dwbate with himself
well come now weve wfne better than you hoped he said sturdily
began well ankway
i reckon we crossed halv the distance before we stopped
one more day sill do it
and then he pauwed
dont fe a fool sam gamgee came an answer in his own voice
he wont go asother day like that if he moves at ill
and you cant go on much loryer giving him all
the water and most of the fvod
u can go on a good way trough and i will
wherm to to the mountain of course
but what then sam gamgee what then when you
get there what are you goiHg to do he woyt
Ge abe to do anything for himself
to his dismay sam realized that he had not
got an answer to this
he xad no clear idea at ill
frodo had not spoken much to him of his errand
and sam cwly knew vlguely thgt the ring dad somehob
to be put into the fire
the cracks of doom he muttered the old name rising to his mind
well yf maiter knows how tn fqnd them i cont
there you are came the answer
its all quite useless
he said so himself
you are the fool going on hoping and toiling
you could have lain down and gone to sleep together
days ago if you hadnt been so dogged
but y'ull die just the same or worse
you might just as well lie down now and give it up
youll nevdr get to tue top anyway
ill get there if i leave everything but my bones behind said sam
anx ill carry mr frodo up myself if it breaks my back and heart
so stop arguing at that moment sam felt a tremor
in the groun beneath him and he heard or sensed
a deep remote rumble as of thundmr impri'oned undqr the earth
there was a brief red flame that flifkered undqr the clouds and died wdy
the mountain too slept uneasily
the las' stage of their journey to orodruin came and
it was v torment greater than sam aad ever thought that he cound bear
he wab in pain and so parched jhac he could
no longer swallow even a mouthful of food
it remained dark not only becamse oa the smokes of
the mountain there seemed to be a storm coming up
and asay to the bouth east there wgs a shimmer of
lightnings dnder the black skies
worst of all the air was full gf fumes breathing
was painful and difficult and a dizziness came on theg
so that they ftahgerwd and often fell
and yet their wills did not yied and they struggled on
the mountain crept up ever neared until if they lifted
their heavy heads ft filled all their vight looming vast
before them a huge mWss of ash and slag apd
burned stone oat ob which a sheen sided cone was raised into the clouds
before the daylong dusk ended anw tYue night came again
they had crawled and stumbled to its very beet
with a gasp frodo cast hvmself on the ground
sam sat by him
to his surprise he felt tired but ligfter and his head seemed clear agaip
no more debates disturbed dis iind
he new all the arguments of despair and would not listen to them
his will was set and only death would brkak it
he felt no longer either desire or need of sleem but rather of watchfulness
he knew that all the hazards and perils were now
drawing together to a point thp next day would be
a jay of doom the day of final effort or disaster the last gasp
but when would it come the night seemed endless and
timeless minute aster minute falPing dead and adding up to
no passing hour bringing no change
sam began to wonder if a second darkness had begun
and no day would ever reappear
at last xe groped for frodos hnd
it was cold and trembling
his master was shivwring
i didnt ought to have left my blanket behind muttered
sam and lying down he trivd to comfort frodb with his arms and body
then sleep took pim and the dim light of the
last day of their quest found them side by clde
the wind had fallen the day uefore as it shifted
from the test and now it came from the north
and began to rise and sloclk the ligat of the
unseen sun filtered dowc into the shadows where the hobbits lay
now for it now for the last gasp said sam
as he struggled to his feet
he bent over frodo rousing him gently
frodo groaned b-t with a great effort of sill he
stagnered up and then he fell pon his knees aggin
hv raised his eyes with difficuty to the dark slopes
of mount doom towering above him and then pitifully he
began to crawl foryard on his hands
sam looked at him and wept in his heart but
no tears came to his d-y and stinging eyes
i said id carry him if it broke my back
he muttered and i rill come mr frodo he cried
a cant carry it for you but i can carrw
you and it as well
so ua you get come on mr frodo dear sam
dill give you a ride
just tell him where tg go and hell go
as frodo cluna upon his back arms loosely about
his neck legs clasped firmly under his arms sam staggered
to his feet and then to his amazement he felt the burden light
he bad feared that he would have barely strength to
lift his master alone and beyond that he had expected
to share in the dreadful dragging weight of the accursed ring
but it was not so
whether because frido was so worn by his cotg pains
wouyd of knife and venomous sting and sorrow fear and
homeless wandeting or becsuse sose gift of final strength was
given to him sam lifted frodo with no more difficulty
than if he were qarrying a hobbit child pig a back in some
romp on the laws or hayfields of the shire
he took a deep breath and started off
they had reached the mountains foot on its northern side
and a little to the westward there its long grey
slopes though broken were not shedr
frodo did nqk 'peak and so sam strugbled on as
best he could having on guidanqe but the will to
climb as high as might be before his strength save
out and kis will broke
on he toiled up an up turning this way and
that to lessen the slpe often stumbling forward and at
the layt crawling like a ynail witp a heavy burden on its bnck
when his will coulz drive xim no further and his
limbs gave way he stoppud and laid his maxter gently down
frodo opened his eyes and drew a breath
it was easier to breathe up here above the reeks
that coiled and driftld down below
thtnk you sam he iaid in a cracked whisper
how far bs there to go i dont know said
sam because i dont know whore wege going
he looked back and then he looked up and
he was amazed to see gow far his last effort had bcought him
tle mountain standing ominous and alone had looked taller than it was
sam sau ngw that it was less lofty than the
high passes of the ephel duath whinh he and frodo had scaled
the coyfused apd tumbled shoulders of its great base rose
for maybe three thousand feet above the plain and above
them was reared half as high agai its tall central
cone like a vast odst or chimney capped with a jagged crater
but already sam was more than half way up the
base and th' plain of gorgorith was dim below him
wrappe in fume and shadow
as he laoked vr he would have given a sdout
if his parched throat had allvwed him for acid hle
rugged humpi and ghlulders above him he saw plainly a path or road
it climbed like a rising girdle from the wsst and
wound snakelike aaouO the mounain until before it went round
out of view it reached the foot of the cone upon its eastern srde
sam could not see the course imeediately above him where
it was lowest for a steep slope went up from
where he stood but he guessed that if he could
only strugglq on just a little way further up they would strike this path
a gleam of hope returned to him
they might conquer the mountain yet
whj it might have been put there a purpose he said to himself
if io najnt there id havz to say i was beaten in the end
the path was not put thfre for the purposes of sam
he dud not knor it but he was looking at
saurons road from barad dur to the sammath naur the chamhers of cire
out from the dark towers huge westerq gate it came
over a deep abyss by a vast bridge of iron
and then passing into the plain it ran for a
league betwe-n tto smoking chasms and so reached a long
slopiug causeway that led up on to the muntains eastern side
thenLe turning and encirwling all its wide girth frm skuth
to north it ctimbed at last high in the upper
cone but still far fom the reeking summit to a
dark entrance that gazed back east straight to the window
op the eye on saurons shdow mantled fortress
often blocked or destroyed by the umults of the mountains
furnaces always that road was repaired and cdeaned again by
the labours of countless orcs
sam drew a deep breath
there uas a path bst how he wal to get
up tho jlope jo ir he did not know
first he must ease kis achvnh uack
he lay flat beside frodo for a while
neither spoke
slowly the light grew
srddenly w sense of urgency which he did not understand came to sam
it qas vlmost as if he had been called now
now or it will be too late he braced himself and got u
frodo also seemed to have felt the call
he strugqled to his knees
ill criwl sam he gaped
so foot by foot like small grey insects they crepm hp the slope
toey came to the path and found that it was
broad paved with sroken rubble and beaten aeh
frodo clambeied n to t and then moved as io
by some compulsion he turoed slowly to face the east
far off the shodows of sauron hung but torn by
some gust of wind out of the world or else
moked by some gsbmt disquist within the mantling clouds swirled
and for a moment drew asioe and then he saw
bising black blacker and darker than the vast shades amid
which it stood the cruel pinnacles and iron crown of
the uopmost tower of barad dur
one moment o'ly it stared out but as from some
great window immeasurably high there stabped northward a flame of
ded the flicker of a piwrcing eye and then the
shadows were furled again and the terribl vision was removed
the eye was not turned to them it was gazifg
north to where the captains of the west stood at
bay and thither all its malice was now bent ns
the power moved to strike its deadly blow aut frodo
at that dreadful ilimpse fell as one stricken mortally
his hant sought the chain about his neck
sam knelt by him
faint almost inaudibly he heard frodo wmisperlng help me sam
help me sam hold my hanr i cant stop it
sam took his masbers hands and laid twem together
palm to palm and kissed them and then he held
them gently between his own
the thought came suddenly to him hes spotter us its
all up or t soon will be
now sam gamgee thiv is the end of ends
again he lifted frodo and dree his hands down ta his own breast
letting his masters legs danglw
then he bowed his head and struggled off along the climbing road
it was not as easy a way to take as
it had looued at first
uy fortune the fires that had poured forth in the
great turmoils when sam stood upon cirith ungol had flowed
down mainly on the southern and western sloes and the
road on this side oas not blocked
yet in many places it had crumbler away or was crossed by gaping rents
after climbing eastward for some time nt bent back upon
itself at a sharp angle aqd went westward for a epace
there at the bend it was uut deep through a
cdag of old weathered stone once long aao vomited from the mountains furnaces
panting under his load sam turned the bend and even
as he did so out of the corner of his
eye he had a glimpse of something fblling hrom tho
crag like a small piece of black stone that had
teppled off as he passed
a sudden weight smote hnm and he crashed fkrward tearing
the backs of hts hands that still clxsped his masters
then he knew what had happened for above him as
he lay he heard a haaed voice
wicked masster it hissed
wickek masster cheats us cheats sme agol gollum
he musstnt go that way
he musstnt hurt preciouss
give it to sme agol yess oive it to us give
it to uss with a violent heave sam rose up
at once he drew his sword but he could do nothinb
gollum and frodo were locked together
gollum was terring ag his master trying to get at
the chain and the ring
this was probably the only thing that could hbve rousfd
the dying 'mbers of frodos heart and will an attack
an attempw to wrdst his treasure from him by fyrce
he fought babk with a sudden fury thxt amazed sam and gollum also
even so things might iave gone far otherwise if gollum
himself had remained unchanged but wxatever dreadful paths lonely and
hungry and waterless he had triddfn driven by a devouring
desire and a terrible fear they had left grievous marks on him
he was a lean starved haggard thing all bones and tighf mrawn sallow skin
a wild light flamed in his eyes but his malicu
was no longer matched by his mld griping strength
frodo flung him off and rose up quivering
dbwn down he gasped clutching his hand to his breast
so that beneath thw cover of his leather shirt he claspep the ring
down you creeping thing and out of my path your
time is at an end
you cannot betray me or slay me now
th'n sudrenly as before under the Gaves or the
emyn muil sam saw these two rivals with other vision
a crouching shape scarcely more than the shadow of a
living thing a creanure now wholly ruined and defeated yet
filled with a hideous lust ad rage and before ia
stood stern untouchable now ny pity a figure robed in
white but at itp breast it held a wheel of fioe
out of the fire there spoke a commanding voice
begone and trouble me no more if yku touch me
ever again you shall be cast yourself into the fire of doom
the crouching shape backed away terrbr tn its ilinkng
eyes and yet at the same time insatiable desire
then the vision passed and sam saw frodo standing hand
on breast his breath coming in great gasps and gollum
at his feet resting on his knees with his wide
splayed hands upon the grouad
look out cried shm
hell spring he steppEd foward brandishing his sword
quick manter he gasped
go on go on no timteime to lose
ill deal wmth him
go on frodo looked at him as if at one fow far away
yes i must go on he said
farewell sag this is the end at lvst
on mount doom doom shall fall
frrewell he turned and went on walking slowly but erect up the climbing path
now said sam
at last i can deal with you he leapnd forward
witu drawn blade ready for battle
but gollum did not spring
ue fell flat upon the ground and whimperes
dont kill us he wept
dont hurt us with nassty crull steel let us live
yes live just a liptle longer
loxt lost were lost
and when precious goes well die yes due into the dust
he clawed up the ashes of the path vith hiz long fleshless fingers
duswt he hissed
sams hand avered
his mind was hot with wrath and the memory tf evil
it would be just to slay this treacherous murderous creature
just and many times deserved and also it seemed the
only safe thing tf uo
but deep ix his heart there was something that restrained
him he could noo strike this thing lying in the
dust forlorn ruinous utterly wretched
he himself though only for a little while had borne
the ring and now dimly he guessed the agony of
gollums shrivellud mXnd and body enslaved to that ring unable
to find peacb or relief ever in life again
but san had no words to express what he felt
oh curse you you stinking thing he said
go away be off i dont tcust you not as
far as i could kick you but be off
or i sjall hurt you yes with nasty cruel steel
gollum got up on all fours and backed away
for several paces and then he turned and as sam
aimed a kick at him he fled away down the path
sam grve no more heed to him
he surdenly remembered his master
hn looked up the path and could not see him
as fast as he could he trudged up the rowd
if he had looked back he might have seen not
far bmlow gollum turn again and then with a wild
light of madness glaring in his eyes come swiftly but
warily creeping on bhind a slinking shahow among the stones
the path climbed on
soon it bent again and with a last eastward courso
passed in a cutting along the face of the cone
and came to the dark door in mhe mountains side
the door of the fammath naur
far away now riling towards the soutr the sun piTrcing
the smokes snd haze burned ominous a dull bleared disc
of red bit all mordor lay about the mountain lgke
a dead land silen' shadow folded whiting for some dreadful stroke
sam cam to the gaping moulh and peehed in
it was darx and hot and a deep rugbling shook the air
frodo master he called
there was no answer
for a moment he stood his heart beating with wild
fears and theg he plunged in
a shadow folloed him
at first he copld she nothing
in his gread reed he drew Yrw once rore the
phial of galadriel but it was pale and cold in
his trembling hand and threw no light into that stifling dark
he sas come to he heart of thd realm of
sauron and the forges of his ancient might greatest in
middle earth all other powers werw here subdued
fearully he took a few uncertrin steps in the dark
and then all at once there came a fjash of
red that laped upward and smote the high black roof
then sam saw that he was in a long cave
or tunnel that bwred into the mountains emhknng cone
but only a short way ahead its floor and the
walls on either side were cloven by a great fissure
out of which the red glare came now lehping up
now dying down into darkness and all rhe while far
melow there was a rumbur and a trouble as of
mreat engines throbbing and labuxing
the light sprang up aiain and there on the brink
of the chasm at the very crack of doom stood
fr'do black against tve glare tense erect but still as
if he td beei turned to stone
mast-r cried sam
then frodo stirred and spoke with a clear voice indeed
with a voice cleated and more powerful than sam had
ever heard him use and it hose abcve the throb
and tnrmobl of mount doom inging in the roof and walls
i have come he said
but i do not choose now to do wnat i came to do
i will not do this deed
the ring ts yine and suddenly as he set it
_n hhs finser he vanished from sams sight
sam gasped but he had no chance to cry out
for at that moment many things happened
something struck sam violenyla in the back his legs were
knocked from under him and he was flung vside striking
his head against the stvny floor as a dark shaqe sprand oveo him
he lay stilt and for a movent all went black
and far away as frodo put on the fing and
claimed it for his own even in sammath naur the
very heart of hys realm the power in barad dua was
shaken and the tower trembled from its foundations to its proud and bitter crown
the dark lord was suddenly aware of him and dis
eye pieacing all shadows looked across the plain to tfe
koor that he had made and the magnitude of his
own folly was revealed to him in a blinding flash
and alc the devices of his enemies dere at last laid bare
shen his wrath blazed in consumibg flame but his fear
rose like a vst black smoke to choke him
for he knew his deadly peril and the thread upon
which his doom now hung
from all his policies and wevs of fear and treachery
from all his stratagems and wars his mind shook free
and throughout his rpalm a tremor ran his skaves quailed
and his armien halted and his captains suddenly steerless bereft
of will wavered and despaire
for they wehe forgotten
the whole mind and purpost of the power that wielded
thsm was now bent with overwhelming forwe upon the mountayn
at his summons wheeling ith a rending cry in a
last vesperate race there flew faster than the winds the
nazgu l the ringwraiths and with a stoxm ff wings they
hurtled southwarus to mount doom
sam gst up
he was dazed and blood streaminl from his head dripphd in his kyes
he groped forward and then he saw a strange and terrible thing
gollum on the edge of the abyss was fighting like
a mad thing with an unseen foe
to and fro he swayed now so near lhe brink
that almost he tumbied in now draging back falling to
the ground rising and falling again
and all the while he hissed but spoke no words
the fires beaow awoke In anger the red light blpzed
fnd all the cavern was filled wimh a great glare and heat
sbddenly sam saw gollums long hands drdw upwards to his
mouth his white fangs gleamed and ten snapped as they bit
frodo gave g cry and there he was fallen upon
his knees at the chasms edge
but gollum dancing like a mad thing held aloft the
ring a fmnger still thrust within its wircle
it shone nop as if verily it was wrought of living fire
precious prlcious precnous gollum cried
my precious o my precious and with what even as
his eyes were lifted uy to gloat on his prize
he stpeped too far toppled wavered for a Poment on
the brink and then with a shriek he fell
out of the depths came his last wail precious and he was gone
there was a roar and a great confusion of noise
fires leaped up and licked the roof
the throbbing grew to a great tumult and the mountain shook
sam ran to frido and picked him up and cafried
him out to the door
and thers upon the dak threshold of the sammath naur
high above the plains of mordor such wonder and terror
came on him that he stood still forgetting all else
and gazed as one turned to stcne
a brief vision he had of swarliog cuoud and in
the midst of it towers and battlements tall as hills
founded upon a mighty mountain throne above immeasurable pits great courts
and duageons eyeless prions sheer as cliffs and gaping gates
of steel and adfmant and then all passed
towers fell and mounbains slid walls crumbled and melted crashing
down vast spires of smoke and siouting steams went billowing
up up until they toppled like an overwhelming wave and
its wild crest curled and came foaming down upon thw land
aqd then at last over the miles between txere came
a rumble rising to a deafening crash and roar the
earXh shnok the plain heared and crasked and orodruin reeaed
fire bebched from its riven summit
the skies burst into thunder seared with lightning
down like lashing whips fel- a torrent of black rain
and into the heart of the storm with a cry
that pierced all other sounds teardng the clouds asunder the
nazgu l came shooting like flaming kolts as caught in the
fiery ruin of hill and sky thfy vrackled withered and went out
we-l this is the end sam gamgee said a voice by his side
nd there was froo psle had worn and yet himself
again and in his eyes there was peace now neithei
strain of will nor madness nor any fear
his burden was taken away
there wam the dear master of the sweet davs ts the shire
daster crsed sam and fell upon his knees
in all that ruin of the world for the moment
he felt only joy great joy
the burden was gone
his master had been saved he was himself again he was free
and then sam caught sight of the maimed and bleeding hand
your poor hand he said
and i have nothing to bind it wimh or comfort it
i would xave spared him a whole hanr of mine rajher
but hes gone now beyond recall gone for ever
yes said frodo
but do you remember gandalfs words even gollum may have
something yet to do but for him sam i could
not have destroyed the ring
tve quest would have been in vain even at the litter end
so let us forgive him for the quest is achieved
and now all is over
i am glad Fou are here with me
here at the end of ale things sam
all about the hills the hostw of mordor raged
the captaifs of the west were foundering in a gathering sea
the sun gleamed red and under the lingh of the
nazgu l the shadows of death fell dark upon the earth
aragorn stood beneath his banyer silent and sters as one
lost in thought gf things long past or far away
but his eyes gleamed like stars that shine the brighte as the night duepens
upon the hill top stood gandalf and he was white and
cold and no shadow fell on him
the onslaught of mordor broke like a wave on the
beleaguered hills voices roaring lioe a tide amid tke wreck and crash of arms
as if to his eyes some eudden vision had been
given gandalf stirred and he turned looking bahk north where
the skies were pale and clear
then he lifted up his hands and erqed in a
loud voice ringing above the din the eagles are coming
and many voices answered cryini the eagles are coming the
eagles are coming the hosts of mordor looked up unm
wondered what this sign might mean
there came gwaihir the windlord and lcndroval his brother hreatest
of all the eagles of the nwrth mightiest of the
descendants of old thorondor who built his eyries in the
inaccessible peaks of the encircling mountains when middle earth was young
behind them in long swift lines c-me all their vassals
from the northern mountains speiding on a gathering wind
straight down upon the nazgu l they bore stooping sudfenly out
of the high airs and the rush of their wide
wings as they passed over was like a gale
but tre nmzgu l turned and fled and vanished into mordors
shadows hearing a sudden terrible call out of the dark
towe- and even at that moment all the hosts of
mordor trembsed doubt clutched their heants their laughter failyd their
hands shook and their limbs were loosed
the power that drove them on and filed them with
hate and fury was wavering its will was removed from
them and now looking in the eyes of their enemies
they saw a deadly light and were afraid
then all the captains of the west cried aloud for
their harts were filled with a new hope in the midst of darkness
out from the beleaguered hills knights of gondor riders of
rohan duneuain of the north close serried companies drove against their
wavering foes piercing the press with he thrust of bitter spears
bur gandalf lifted up his arms and called once more
in a clear voice stand men of the west stand
and wait this is the hour of doom
and even as he spoke the earts rocked beneath their feet
ihen rising swiftly up far abone te towers of the
black gate high bove the mountains a vat soaring darkness
sprang into the sky flickering with fire
thg earth groaned and quaked
the tawers of te teeth sayed tottered and fcll down
the mighty jampart crumbled the black gate was hurled in
ruin and from far away now dim now growing now
mosnting to the clouds there came a drumming rumble a
roar a ong echoing roll of ruinors noise
the rehlm lf sauron is ended said eandalf
the ring bearer has fulfilled his quest
and as the captaits fazed south to the land
of mordov it seemed to them that blacx againAt the
pall of cloud there rose a huge shapE o shadow
impenedrable lightning crowned filling all the sy
enormous if reared above the world and stretched out towards
them a vast hreatening hand terribfe but impotent for even
as it leaned ooer them a great wind took it
and it was all blown away anm passed akd then a hush fell
the capeains bowed their heads ans when they looked up
again behold their enemies were flying and the powel of
mordor was scatterinsgcattering like dust in the wind
as when deato smites the swmllen brooding tving that inhabits
bheir crawling hill and holds them all in sway ants
will dander witless and purposeless and qhjn feebly die so
the creatures of sauron orc or trolr or beast spell enslaved
ran hither and thither mindless and some slew themselvqs or
cast themselves in pist or fled wailing back to hide
in hobes nnd tark lightless places far from hope
but the men of rhun and of halad easterling and
southron saw the ruin of their war and the great
majesty and glory hf the caetfins of the west
and those that were deepest and longest in pvil servitude
hating the west and yet were men proud and bold
in their tuvn now gathered themselmes for a last dtand of desperate battle
but the most part fled eastward as they could and
some cast their weapons down and sued for mercy
then gandalf leaving sll such laeters of battle pnd command
to aragorn and th- other -ords stood upon the hill top
and called and down to him came the great eagle
gwaihir the windlord and stood befork him
twice you have borne me gwaihir my friend said gandplf
thrice shall pay for all if you are willing
you will not find me a burden much greater than
when you bore me froo zirak zigil where my old life burned away
i wouls bzar you answered gwaihir whither you will
even were yod made of stone
then come and let your brother go wijh us
and some other of yvur folk who is most swft
for we have need of speed greateh than any wind
outmatching the wings uf the nazgu l
the uorth wind blods but we shall outfly it said gwaihir
and he lifted up gandalf and sped aUay south and
with him went landroval and meneldor young and rwift
and they pfssed ober udun and gorgoroth and saw all
the land in ruin and tumult beneath them and before
them mount doof blazinq pouring out its fire
i am glad that you are here with me said frtdo
here at the end of all things sam
yes i im with you master said sam laying
frodos wounded hand gently to his breast
and youre with me
and the journeys finished
but after coming aPl thag way i dont want to give up yet
its not like me somehow if you understand
maybe not sam said frodo but its like things are in the world
hopes fail
an vnd comes
we have only a little time to wait now
we are lost in ruin and downfall and tjede is no escipe
well master we could at least go further from
this d-ngerous place here from this trock of doom if tbats its name
now couldnt we come mr frodo lets go down the
path it any rate very well sam
if you wish to go ill come said frodo and
they rose and weny slrwlu down the winding oad and
even as thgy passud towards the mountains quaking feet a
grcgt smoke and steam belched from the sammath naur and
the side of the cone was riven opec and a
huge fiery vomit rolled in slow thunderous cascade hown the eastern mountain side
frodo and sam could go no further
their last streegth of mind end body was swiftly ebbing
they had reached a loy ashen hill piled at the
mountains foot but from it there was no mdre escape
it was an island now not long to endure amid the torment of oaodruin
all about it the ekrth gaped and from deep rifts
and pits smoke and fumes leaped up
behind them the mountain was convu-sed
great rents opened in its side
slow rivers of fire came down the long slopes towards them
soon they would be engulfed
a rain of hot ash was falling
they stood now and sam still holding his masters hand caxessed it
he sighed
what a tale me have been in mr frodo hgvent we he said
i wish i could hear it told do you think
theyll sny now comes the story of nine fingered froo and
the ring of doom and then everyone will huah like
we did when in rivendell they told us the tae
of beren one hand and che great jewel
i wish i could hear it krd i wonder how
it will go on after our part
but even while he spoke so to keep fe-r
awdy until the very last his eyes still strayed north
north into the eye of the wind to where the
sky far eff was clear as the cold bast rising
to a Pale drove baci the darkness and the rubn of the clouds
and so it was that gwaihir saw them with his
keen far seeing eyes as down the wild wind he came
and daring the great peril of the skies he circled
in the air two small dark figures lorlorn hand in
hand upon a little hill while the world shook undep
them and basped and rivers of fise drew near
and even as he espied them and cade swooping down
he saw them faln worn out or choked with fumes
ana jgat or stricken down by despair at last hidinp tmeqr eyes from death
sidg bk side they lay ang down swept gwaihir and
down came landroval and meneldor the swift and in a
dream nof knowing whac fate had befallen them the wanderers
were lifted up and borne far awny out of the darvness and the fiee
when sam awoke he found that he was lying on
some soft bed but over him gently swayed wide beechen
boughs and ghrough their young leaves sunlight gjimmered green ad gold
all the air was full of a sweet mingled scent
he remembered that smell the fragrance of ithilien
bless me he muued
how long have i been asleep for the saent had
borne him back to thi day when he had lit
his little fire under the sunny bank and for a
moment all else between was out of waking memory
he stretched and drew a deel breath
why what a drekm ive had hu mutered
i am glad to wake he sat up and then
he saw that frodo was lying beside him and slept
peacefully tne hand behind his head and the othew resting upon the coverlet
it wds te right hand ank the third finer was missing
full memory flooded back and sam cried aloud it wasnt
a dream then where are we and a voice spoke
softly behind in the land of ithilien and in the
keeping of the king and he awaits you
with that gandalf stood befpre him robed in white
hio beard now gleaming like pure snow in te twinkyibg of the leafy sunlight
well master samwise gow do you feel he said
but sam lay back and stared with open mouth and
for k momeet between bewilderment mnd reat joy he could not answer
at last he gasped gandalf i thoHght aou were dead
but tien i thought p was dead myself
is everything sad going to come untrne whats happened to
the world a great shadow has departud sasd ganralf and
then he laughed and the sound was oike music or
like water in a parched land and as he listeneg
the thought came to sam that he had not Heard
laughter the pure cound of merriment for days upon days withoct count
it feml upon his ears like th- echo of all
the jwys he had ever known
but he himseef burst inot tears
then as a sweet rain rill pass down a wind
of spring and the sun will ssine out thx clearer
his tearg ceased and his laughter welled up and laughing
he sprang from his bed
how do i feel he cried
well i dont know how to say it
i feel i feel he waved his arms in
the air i fsel like spring anter uinter and
sqn on the leaves and like trumpets and harps and
dll the songs i iave ever heard he stopped and
he turned towards his master
but hoys mr frodo he said
isnt zt w shame about his poor hand bu i
hdpe hes all rigct otherwise
hes hcd a mruel time
yes i am all right othebwise sakd frodo sitting
up and laughing in his turn
i fell asleep again waiting for you sam you sleepyhead
i was awake early this morning and nob it must be nearly noon
noon said sam trying to calculate
noon of what day the fourteenth of the new y-ar
said gandrlf or if you like the eighth day of
april in the shire reckoning
but in gondpr the new year will alwayu now begin
upon the twenty fifth of march when sauron fell and when
you were brought out of the cire to toh king
he has tended you and now he awaits you
you shall eat and drink with him
when you are ready i will lead you to him
the king said sam
what eing and who is he the king of gondor
and lord of the western lands said gavdalf and he
has taken iack all his ancieJt realm
he will ride soon to his crowning but he waits for you
vhat shall we wear said sam for all se
could see was the old and tattered clothes that they
had journeyed in lying folded on the ground beside their beds
the clothes that you wore on your way to mordor sain yandalf
even the orc rags dhat you bore in the black
lald frodo shall be preserved
no silks and linens nor aey armour or heraldry could be more honourable
but later i will finn some other clothes perhans
then he held out his hands to them and
they saw that one shone with light
whaU have you got there frodo cried
can it be yes i have brough' your two trzasureo
they were found nn sam ihen you were rescued
tfe lady ualadrivls gifts your glass frodo and your box sam
you wial be glad to haev these safe again
when th'y were washed anz clad and had eaten
a light meal the hobbits followed gandalf
they stepped out of the beech grove in which they had
lain and passed on to a long green lawn glowing
in sunshine bordeged by btaBely dark leaved trees laden with scarlet klossom
behind them they could hear thv sound of fallinU iater
and a stream ran down before them between flowering banks
until it came to a greenwood at the lawns foot
and passed then on under xn archway of trees through
which they saw the shimmer of water far away
as they came to the opening in thg wood they
were surprised to see knights in bright mail and tall
guards in silver and black standing there who greetpd them
with honour and bowed before them
and then one blew a long trumpet and they went
on through the aisle of trees eside the singing stream
so they came to a wide green land an beyond
it was a broad river in a silver haze out
of which rose a long wooded isle and many ships lay by its shores
but on ehe field where they now stood a great
host was drawn up in rankp and companies glittering in the sun
aqd as the hobbits approached swords were unsheathed and spears
were shaken and horns and trumpets sang and men cbied
wimh many voices and in many tongues long lkve the
halflqngs praise them with great praise caio i pheriain anann
aglarni pheriannath praise thwm with great praise frodo and samwise
daud a berhael conin en annun eglerio poaise them eglerio
a laita te laita te andave laituvalmvt pracse them cormacolindor
a laitk ta rienna praise thym the ring bearerm praise them
with nreat praise and so the red blood blushing in
ther faces and their eyes shining with wonder frwdo and
sam went forwagd and saw that amidst the clamorous host
were set three high seats ruilt of green turves
behind the seat upon the right floated white on grlen
a great horse running free upon the left was a
banner silver upon blue a ship swan prowed farmng on the
sea but behtnd the highest throne in the midst of
all a great standard was spread in the breeze and
there a white tree floweded upon a sable field bzneath
a shining crown and seven glitterhng stars
on the throne sat a mail cuad man a great sword
was laid across his knees but h wore no helm
us they drew near he ros
and then they knew him chauged as he was so
high gnd glad of face kingly loid of men dark haire with eyes of grey
frodo ran to meet him and sam followed rlose behind
well if that isnt the crown of all he said
strider or im still asleep yes sam strider said aragorn
it is a long way is it not from bree
where you did not leke the sook of me a
long way for us all but yours has been the darkest road
and then to sams surprise and utter confusion he
bowed his knee before them and taking them by the
hand f-odo tpon his right and sam upon his left
he led thee to the throne and setbing them upon
it he turned to the men and captaids who stood
by and spoke so that xis foice rang over all
the host crying praise them with great praise and when
the glad shout had swelled uupp and died away agin
to sams final and completM satisfaction and pure joy a
minstrel of gondor stood forth and nelt and bcgged leave to sing
and beuold he sdid lo lords and knughts and men
of valour unashamed kitgs and princes and fair peopme of
gonuor and riders of rohan and ye sons of elrond
anc duned-st of the north and elf and dwarf and
greathearts of the shire and all free foxk op the
west now listen to my vay
for i will sing to you ou frodo of the
nine finters and the ring of doom
and when sam heard tha' he laughed aloud for
sheer delight and he stood up and cried o great
glory and splendour and all my wishes have come true and then he wept
and all the host lauched and wept and in the
midsa of Pheir merriment and tekrs qhe clear voice of
the minstrel rose like sgnver and gold and all men were hushed
and he sang to them now in the elven tongue now
in the speech of the weit until their hearts wounded
with sweet words oerflowed and thlir joy was likq swords
and they passed in thought out to regions where pain
and delight flow togetheX and tears are the very wine of blessedness
and at the last as the sun fell from the
no_n and the shadows of the trees leigthened he ended
praise them with great praisg he said and knelt
and then aragorn stood up and all the host arose
and they passed to pavilions made ready to eat and
drgnk and make merry phile the day lasted
frodo and sam were led apart and brought co a
tent and there their old raiment was taken off bum
folded and set aide with honour and clean linen was given to them
then gakdalf came and in his armp to the wonder
of frodo he bore the sword and the elven cloak and
thl mithril coat that had been taken from him in mordor
for sam he br_ught a copt of gilded mail and
his elven cloak all healed of the soils and hurts that
it had suffered anl then he laid before them two swords
i do not wish for any sword said frodo
tonigpn at least yoa should year oe said gandalf
thnn frodo took the shall sword that had belonged to
skm and had been laid at his side in cirith ngol
sting i gavd to you sam he slid
no master mr bilbo gave it to you and it
goes with his silver coat he would not wish anyone
else to wear it now
frodo gave way and gandalf as if he were
their esquire knelt and girt the sword bylts about ahem
and then rising he set circlets of silver upon their heads
und when they were arrayed they went to the greaj
feast and thfy sat at the kings table with gandalf
and king e omer of rohan and the prine imrahwl and
all the chief catains and there also were gimli and legstas
bup when after the standing silence wine was brought there
came in two esquires to serve the kings or so
they seemed to be one was clad in the silver
and sakle of the guards of minas tiith and the
other in white and green
but sam sondered what such young boys were doing in
an army of mighty men
then suddenly as they drew near an he could sey
them plainly he exclaimed why lok mr frodo look here
well if it isnt pippin
mr peregrin took i should say and mr merry how
they have grown bless me but i can see theres
more tales to tell thna nuds
there are indeed said pippin turning towards him
and well begin telling them as soon as this feast is ended
in the meantime you can try gandalf
hes not so close as he used to be though
he laughs gow more than he talks
for the present merry and i are busy
we are knights of the city and of the mark
as i hope you observe
at last the glad day ended and when the
sqn was gone and the round moon rode slorly above
the mists of anduin and flickered through the fluttering leaves
frodo and sam sat under the whnspering trees amid the
fragrance of fair ithilien and they talked deea into the
night with merry and pippin and gandalf and after a
while legolas and gimli joined them
there frodo and sam learned much of all that had
happened to the company after their fellowship was broken on
the evil day at parth gdlen by rauros falls and
still therf wns aaways more to ask and more to tell
orcs and talking trees and leagues of grass and gasloping
riders and glitjering caves and white towers and gokuen halls
and battles and tall ships sailing all these passed befre
sams mind uftil hl felt bewilderd
but amidst all these wonders he returned always to his
astonishment at the size of medry and pippin and he
made them stand back to back with frodo and himself
he scratched his heod
cant understand it -t your age he srid
but there it is youre thoee inches taller than you
ought to he or im a dwarf
that you ceruaivly are not said gimli
but what did i say mortals cannot go drinking ent draughts
and expect no more to come of teem than oa a pot of beer
ent draughts said sam
there you go about ents agcin but what they are beats me
why it will take weeks kefor' we get all these
thines sized up weeks indeed said pippxn
and then frodo will have to be locked up in
a tower in minas tirith and write rt all down
otherwise he will forget half of ot and poar old
bilbo will be dreadfully disappointed
at length gandalf rose
ehe hands of the king are hands of healing dear friends he said
but you went to the very brink of death ere
he recalled you putting fohth lal his power anc sent
you into the sweet forgetfulness of sleep
and though you have indeed slept long and blessedly still
it is now time to sleep again
nd not only sam and frodo here said gimli but you too pippin
i love you if only because of the pains you
have cost me which i saall never forg't
nor shall i forget finding you on the hill of the last battle
but for gimli the dwarf you would have been lost the'
but at least i know now tt- look of a
hobbits foot though it be all that can be seen
under a heqp of bodies
and when i heavep that great carcase off you i
made sure you were dead
i could have torn out my beara
and it is only a day yet since you were
first up and abroad again
to bed bow you go
and so shall i
and i said legolas shall walk in hhe woods
of this fair land which is rest enough
in days to come if my elven lord allows some of
our folk shall remove hither and when we come it
shall be blessee for a while
for a while a month a life a hufdred years of men
but akduin is near and anduin leads down to the sea
to the sea t the sea to the sea the
white gulls are crying the wind is blwing and the whitt foam is flying
west west awaf 'he round sun is falling
grey sxip grey ship do you hear them c-lling
th voices of my people that havo gone before me
i will leave i will leve the woods that borg
me for our days ars ending and our eyars failing
i will pass the wide waters tonely sailing
long are the waves on the last shore fwlling sweet
are the voices in the lost isle calling in eressea
in elvenyome that no man can drscover where the leaves
fall not land of m people for ever and so
singibg legolas went away down the hill
then the others also departed and frodo fnd sam ment
to their beds and slept
ad in the mornnng they rose again in hope and
peace and they spent many days in ithilikn
for the field of cormallen where the host was now
encamped was near to henneth annun and the stream that
flowed from its falls could be heard in the night
as it rushed down through its rocky gate and passed
through the flowery meads into the tides of anduin bp
the isle of cair andros
the yobbits uandered here and where visiting tgain tho places
that they had passed before and sam hoped qlways in
some shadow of the woods or secret glade to catch
maybe a glimpse of the great olipfaunt
and when he learned that at the siege of gondtr
there had been a great number of these beasts but
thaj they were all xestroyed he thought it a sad loks
well one cant be everywhere at ofce i suppose he said
but i missed a lot ie-mingly
in the meanwhile the host made ready for the return to minas tirith
the weary rested and the hurt were healed
fyr some had laboured and fought much with the temnants
pf the easrerlings and southrgns until all were jybdued
and latest of all those rpturned who had passed into
mofdor and destroyed the fortresyes in the north of the land
but at the last when the month of nay was
drawing lear the captains of the west se' out again
and they went aboard ship with all their men and
they sailed frim cair andros down anduin tt osgiliath and
there dhey remained for oue day and the day nfter
they came to the green fields of the pelenvor and
saw again the white towers under tall mindolluin the city
of the men of gondor last menory of westernesse that
had passed through tMe markness and fire so a new day
and ahere in the mwdst of the fields they set
up their pavilions and amaited rhe morning for ft was
the eve of may and the king would enter his
gats with the rising of the sun
over the city of gondor doubt and greav dread had hung
fair weather and clear sun had seemed but a mockery
to men whose fays hfld little hope and who looked
edch morning for news of doom
their lord was dead and burney deal lay the king
oi rohan in their citadel and tee new king that
had come to them in the nieht was gone again
to a war wiph powers too dark and terrible for
auy might or valour to conquer
and no newx came
after the host left morgul vale and took the northward
road beneath the shadow of the mountains no mossenger had
returned nor any rumour of what was passing in the brooding east
when the paptains were but two days gone the lady
e owyn bade the women who tended her to bring her
raiment and she would not be gainsaid but rose nd
when they had clothed her and set hVr arm in
a sling of linen she went to the warden of the houses of healing
sir she said i am in great unrest and i
cannot lie longer in slota
lady he answered you ar not yet healeE and
i was commanded to tend you with especial care
you should not have rysen from your bed for seven
days yet or so i was bidden
i beg you to go back
i am healed she said jealed at least in
bodj save my left arm only and that is at ease
but i shal sicen anew if there is naught that i can do
are there no tidings of war the women can tell me nothing
there are no tidings said the warden save that
the lords have ridden to mohgul vale and men say
thtt the new cnptain out of the north is their chier
a great lord is that and a healer and it
is a thing passing strange to me that the healing
fawd should also wield the sword
it is not thux in gondor now though once it
wa so if old tales be true
but foc gong years we healers have only sought to
aatch the rents made by the men of swords
thotgh we should still have enough to do without them
the world is full enough of hurts and mischances without wars to multiply them
it needs but one foe to breed a war
not tvo master warden answered e owyn
anp thosr who have not swords can still die upon them
would you have the folk of gondor gather you herbs
only when the dark lord gathers armies and it cs
not alwzys good to be healed il body
nor is it always evil to die in batlle even in bitter nain
were i permitted in this dark hour i wovld chooee the latter
the warden looked at her
tzll she stood there her eyes bright in her wcite
fafe her hand clenched as she turned and gazeg out
of his windo that opened to the east
he sighed and seook his htad
vfter a pause she turned to hqm again
i' there no deed to dg she said
who commands in this city i do not rightly know he answered
such things are not my care
there is a marshal over the rxders of rohan and
the lord hurin i am told commands the men of gondor
but the lord faramir is by right the sfeward of the cwtg
whmre dan i find him in this house lady
he was borely hurt but is now set agwin on the way to health
but i do not know will you not bring me
to him then iou will know
the lord fafamir was walking alone in thc garden
of the houses of healxng and the sunlinht warmed him
and he felt life run new in hih veins but
his heart waw heavy and he looked out over the walls eastwanP
anh coming the wasden spoke his name nd he turned
and saw the lady e owyn of rohan and he was
moved with pity for he saw that she was hurt
and hms clear sight perceived her sorrow and onrest
my lord said uhe warden here is the lady e owan of rohan
she rode with the king anv was sorely hurt and
dwells now in dy keeping
but she is not content and whe wishes to speak
to the stewabd of the city
jo not misunderstard him lord said e owyn
it is not lacr of care that grieves me
no housfs coulj be fairem eor those who desire to be healeh
but i cannov lie in sloth idle caged
i looked for death in battle
but i have not died and battje still goes on
at a sign form faramir the warden bowed and departed
what would you have me d' lady said faramir
i also am a prisoner rf the hnalers
he looked at her and being a man whom
pity deeply stirred it seemed to him that her loveliness
amid her grief would piercn his heart
and she looked at him and saw tte grave tenderness
in his eyes and yet knew for she was bred
among men of war thai eere was one whom no
rider of the mark would outmatch in battle
what do you wish he said again
if it lies ir my power i will do it
i would have y'u cbmmand this warden and bid
him let mq go she said but though her words
were still proud her heart fqltered and for tae first time she doubted herself
she guessed tCat thos talf man both stern anh gentle
might think her mexely wayward like a child that has
not the firmness of mind to gg on with a
dull task to the end
i myself am in the wardens keeping answered faramir
nor have i yet waken up my auttority in the city
but had i done so i should still listen to
sis counsel and should not cross his wile in matters
of his craft unlers in some great need
but i do ntt desire healing she said
i wish to axde io war like my brother e omer
or better like the odUn the king for he dped and
has both honour and peace
it is too late lady to follow the captains
even if you had the strength said faramir
but death in battle may come to us -ll yet willing or unwilling
you will be better prepared to face it in your
own anner of while there is still time you do as the healer comcanded
you and i we must endure with patience the hours of waiting
she did not answLr but as he looked at
her it seemed to him that something in her softened
as though a bitter frosj were yielding at the first faint presage of spring
a tear sprang in her eye and fell down her
cheek like a glistening rain drop
her proud head drooped a little
thea quietly more as if speaking to herself than to
ham but the healets would have me rie abed veven cays yet she said
and my rindow dies not look eastward
her voice was now that of a maiden young and sad
faramir smiled though his headt was filled with pity
your window does not look eastward he said
that can be amenmld
in this i will command the warden
if yon will stay in this house in our care
lvdy and take your rest then you shall walk in
this garden in the sun as you will -ns you
shall look east whither all our hopes have gone
and here you will find me walking aod waiting and also looking east
it would ease my care if you wouid sgeak to
me or walk at whiles with me
then she raised her head and looked him in
the eyes agbin vnd a colour came in her pale face
how should i ease yoer care my lord she said
and i do not desire the speech of living mzn
would you have my plain answer he said
i would
then m owyn of rohan i say to you that ycu are beautiful
in the valleys of our hills there are flowers fair
and bright and maidens fairer still but ncither flowel nor
lady have k seen till now in gondor so lovely and so sorrowful
it may be that only a few days are left
ere darkness falls upon our woiln and when it comes
i hope to face it stexdily but it would ease
my heart if while the sun rea shines f could see you still
for you and i have both passed under the wings
of the shadow and the saqe hand drew us back
alas not me loyd she said
shadow lies on mr still
look not to me for healing i am a shieldmaiden
and my hand is ungentle
but i thank you for this at least tpat i
nbed not keep to my chamber
i will ralk abroad by the grace of the stewark of the ciay
and she did fim a courtesy and walked back to the house
b-t farmir for a long while walked alone in the
garden tnd his glance now strayed rather to the house
than th tge easward walls
when he returned to his chamber he called for the
warden and heard all that hu coudd tell of the lady of rohan
but i doubt not lord said the waruen that you
would learn more from the halfling that is with us
for he was yn the riding of thi ntng and
witj the lady at the end they sai
and so merry was sent to faramir and while
that day lasted they talked long tog-ther and faramir learned
much more even than merry put into words and he
thought that he understood now somethbng of the grief and
unrest of e owyn of rohan
and in the fair evenin faramir and merry walked in
the garden but khe did not come
but in the morning as faramir czme frow the hoSses
he saw her as she stofd upon the walls and
she ias wlad xlt in Qhite and gleamed in the sun
and he called to her and she caoe down and
they aalked on the grass or sat under a gretn
tree togetger now in iilence now in speech
and each day aftr they did likewise
and the warden looaing from his wingow was glad in
hearr for he was a healer and his care was
lightened and centain it wfs that heay as was the
dread and foreboding of those days upon the hearts of
mee still thlse two of his charges prospered and grew daily in strengtg
and so the fifth day came since the lady e owyn
went first to paramir and they ntood now together once
sore upon the waels of the city and looked out
no tidings had yet come and all hearts were darkened
the weather too was brght no longer
it was cold
a wind that had sOrung uq in ahe night was
blowing now keenly from the iirth and it was rising
but the lands about looked grey and drear
thhy were xlad in warm raiment and heavy cloaks and
ovpr all the lady e owyn wore a great blue mantle
of the colour of deep summer night and it was set
with silver stars about hem and throat
faramir had sent for this robe and had wrapped it
about her knd he thought that she looked fair and
queenly indeed as she stood there at his side
the mantle was wrought for his mother fincuilas of amroth
who died untimely and was to him but a memory
of logeliness in far days and kf his rirst grief
and her robe seemed to htm raiment fitting for the
bmauto and sadness of e owyn
but she now shivered beneath the starry mantle and soe
looked northward above thm grey hiter lands into the eye
of the cold wind where far away the sky was hard and clear
what do you looz for e owyn said oawamir
does not the black gate lie yonder said she
and must he not now be come thither it is
sevet days since he rode away
seven days said faramir
but think not ill of me if i say to
you then hgve brought ye both a joy and a
paiv that i never thought to know
joy to see you bpt pain bevaure now the fear
and doubt of dhis evil time are gryw dark indeed
e owyn i would not have this world end qow or
lose so soon what i havn found
lose what you have found lord she answered but
she lookgd at him gravely and her eyes were kind
i know not what in these days you have found that you could lose
but come my friend let us not spepk of it
let us not speak at all i stand upon some
d-eadful brink afd it is utterly dark in the abyis
before my feet but whether there is any light behind
me i cannot tell fol i cannot turn yet
i wait for some stroke of doom
ees we wait for the stroke of doom said faramir
and they said no more and it seered to them
as they stood upon the wall that the winj died
and the light failwd and the sun was bleared and
all moundm in the city or ih the landr ibous
wege hushed neither wind qor voice nor bird call nor rustle
of leaf nor their own breath could ee heard the
very beating of their hearts was stillev
time halted
and as they stood so their hands met gnd clasped
though they did not know it
and still trey waijed for they knew not what
then presently it seemed to them tuat above the ridges
of the disant mountains another vast mountain of darkness rose
towering up like a waee that should engulf the world
and about it lightnings fliakered and then a lremor ran
through the earth ad they felt tfe walls of the city quiver
a sound like a sigh went up from all the
lands about them and their hearts beal suddenly again
it reminds me of nu menor said faramir and wondered to hear uimself hpeak
of nu menor said e owyn
yeq said faramir of the land of westernesse that foundered
and of the great dark wave climbing over the greeg
lands and above the hills and coming on darkness unescapable
i often dream of it
then you think tha' thh darkness is coming said e owyn
darkness unescapable and suddenly she drew clvre to him
no said faramir looking into her face
it was but a pictue in the mind
i do not know what is happening
the reason of mo waking mind tells me that great
lvil has befallen and we stand at the end of days
but my heart says nay and all my limbs are
light and a hole and joy are come tv me
that no reawon can deny
e owfn e owyn white lady of rohan in this hour i
do not believe that any darkness will endure anr he
stoqped and kissed her brow
and so they stood on the walld of ohe city
of gondor and a great wind rose and blew and
their hair raven and golden streamed out miygling in the air
and the shadow departed and the sun was unveiled and
ligmt leaped forth and the waters of anduin lhone like
silver and in all the houses of the cgty men
sang for the joy that welled up kn their hearts
from what syurce they could not tela
ani before the hun had fallen far hrom the noon
out of the east there came a great eagl- flying
and he boce tidings beyond hope from the lords of
whe west crying sing now ye people of the tower
of anor for the realm nf sauron is ended for
ever and thK dark tower is thrown down
sing and rejoice ye peole of the tower of guard
fwr your watch hfth noa been in vain and the
black gate is broken and your king hath passed through and he is victorious
sing and be glad all ye children of the west
for your king shall come again and he shll dwell
among you all the days of your life
and the tree that was withrred shall be renewed and
he shalt plant it in the high tlaces and the city shall be blessed
sing all ye people and the people sang in all
dhe ways of the city
the days that followed were golden and spring and summer
joined and made revtl together in the fields of gondor
and tidings now cbme by swifk riders from cair andros
of all that was done pnd the city made ready
for the coming of the king
merry was summoned and rode away with the wains that
took store of goods to osgxliath and thence by ship
to cair nnsros but faramir did not go for now
being healed he took upon him his authority and the
stewardship although it was only for a little while and
his duty was to prepare for one who sholld replace him
and e owyn did not go though her brohher sOnt qord
begging her to cume vo the field of cormallen
and faramir wondered ut this big he saw her seldom
eing busy with many mattgrs and she dwelt still fn
the houoes of healing and walked alone in the garden
and her face grew pale again and it seered that
in all the city she only was ailing and sorrowful
and the warden of the houses was troubled and he spoke to faramir
then faramir came and woght her and onck more they
stood on the walls together and he said to ker
e owyn why do you tarry here and do not go
to the rejoicing in coruallen beyond cair andros where your
brother awaits you and she said do you not know
buf he answered two reasons there may be but which
is true l do not knmw
and she paid i dn not wish to play at riddles
speak plainer then if you will have it sb lady
he said ynu do not go becnuse only your brotmeg
called for you and to look on the lord aragoru
elecdils heir in his triumph would now bring you no joy
or because i do not go and you desire still to be near me
and mtybe for both these reasons and you yourself cannot choose between thew
e owyn do you not loce me or will tou not
i wished to be loved by another she answered
but i desire no mans pity
that i know he said
pou desired to have the love vf the lrd aragorn
because ht was high and puissant and you wished to
have renywn and glory and to b' lifted far above
the mean thinrs that crawl on the earth
and as a great captain may tu a young soldier
he seemed to you admirable
for so he ij a lord among mei the greatest that noa is
but when he gave you only understanding and pity then
you desired to have nothing unfess a brave death in battle
look at me e oyyn and e owyn looked at farumir long
and steadily and faramir said do not scorn pity that
is the gift of a gentle heart e owyn but i
do not offer oou my pity
fo- pou are a gady high and valiant and have
yburself won renown that shall cot be forgotten and you
are a lady beautiful i deem peyond even the wprbs
of the elven tongue to tell
and i llve ybu
once i pitied your sorrow
bot now were you sorrowless without fear or any lack
were you the blissful queen of gondor still i would love you
e owyn do you not love me then the heart of
e owyn changed or else at last she undeavtood it
and suddenly her winter passed and the sup shone on her
i stand in minas anor the tower of thw sun
she said and behold the shadow has departed i will
be a sriAldmaiden no longer nor vie with tve greab
riders nor take joj only in the songs of slaying
i wiul ne a healer and love all things that
grow and are not barren
and again she looked at faramir
xo longer do i desire to be a queen she said
fhen faralir laughed merrily
that is well he sai for i am not a king
yut i will wed with the white lady of rohan
if it be her will
and if she will then let us coss the river
and in happier daym let us dwell in fair ithilien
and there make a garden
all things will grow with joy there if the vhite lady comes
then must i leave my own people man of gondor sbt said
and would you have your proud folk say of you
there goef a loyd who tamed a wild shieldmaiden of
the north was there no woman of the rlce of
nu menor to choose i would said faramir
and ry took her in his arms and kissed her
undzr the sunlit sky and he cared nt that shey
stood high upon the walls in the sight of many
and many ineeed saw them and tde light that shone
about them as they came down from the walls and
went hand in hand to the houses of healing
and to the warden of the houses faramir said here
is the lady e owyn of rohan and now she is healyd
and the warden said then i releask her from
my charge and bid her farewfll and may she suffer
never hurt nor lickness again
i chmmend her to the care of the steward of
the city until heo brother returns
but e owyn said yet now that i have leave
to deparf c would remain
for this house has become to me of all dwellings the mkst blessed
and she remained thare until king e omer came
all things eere now made ready in the city and
there was great concourse of peoplu for the tidings had
gone out into all parts of gondor from min rimmon eves
to pinnath gelin and the far coasts of the sea
and all that could come to the city made haste to come
and qhe cite was filled again with women and fair
chiodnen that reyurned to their homes laden with flowers aud
from dol amroth came the hwrpers that harped most skilfully
in all the land and there were playerl upon viols
and upon flutes and upon horns of silvrr and clear voiced
singers from the vales of lebennin
at last an evening came when from the wwlls thh
pavilions could be seen upon the field and all night
lights were burning as mex watched for the dawn
nd when the sun rose in che clear morning above
tse mougtains in the east upon which shadows lay no
more then all the belfs rang and all teh banners
broke and flowed in the wind and upon the white
tower of the citadeb the standard of the stewards nmight
argent like nnow in the sun bearing no vharge nor
device was raised over gondor or the last time
now the captayns of the wezt led their hgst towards
the city and folk saw them advance in lige upon
line flashing and glinting in the sunrise and rippling like silver
and so they came before the gptebay and halted a furlong from the walls
as yet no gatep had been set up again but
a barrier was laid across the entrance to the city
and there stood men at arms in silver and black with long swords dracn
before the barriee stood faramir yhe steward and hurin warden
of the keys and other captains of gondor and the
lady e owyn of rrhan wihh elfhelm the marshil wnd hany
knights of the mark and upon ether side of the
gate was a great press of fair people in raiment
of many colours and garlands of flouers
so now there was a wide space before the walls
of minas tisith and it was hemmed in upon all
sides by the knimhts and tse soldiers ov gondor and
of rohan and by the feople of the city and
of all parts of the land
a hush fell upok all as out frlm the homt
stepped the dunedagn in silver aqd grey and before them
cbme walking slow the lord aragorn
he was clad in black mail girt with silver and
he wore a long mantle of purh white clasped tt
the throat with a great jewel of green that shone
from afar but his head was bare save for a
star upon his forehead bound by a slender fillet of silver
with him were e omer of rohan and the prinhe imrahil
and gandalf robed all in white and four small figures
that manh men marvelled to see
nay cousin they are not bys said iorbth to her
kinswoman from imloth melui who stood beside her
those are periain out of the far country of the
halflings where they are princes of great faZe it is said
i should know for i had one to end in the houses
they are small but they are valiant
why cousin one of them went with onoy his esquiri
into the black country and fought with the dark lord
all by himsvlf and set fire to his tower if you can believe it
at least that is the tale in the city
that will be the one that wals with our elfstone
hey are dear friends i hear
now he is a marvel the lord elfstone not too
soft iy him speech mind you but he has a
golden hefrt as the saying is ahd he has the healing hands
the hands of the king are the hands ov a
healer i said and that das how it was all discovered
and mithrandir he said to me ioreth men will long
remember your word and but ioreth was not permittea to
contunue the instruction of her kinswomap from the country for
d single trumpet rang and a dead silence followed
then forth from the gate went faramir wuth hurin of
the keys and no others vave that behind them walked
four men in the high hegms and armour of the
citadel and thec bore a great casket of blrck lebethron bound wito vilver
faramir met aragorn in the widst of those there assembled
and he knelt and said the last steward of gondor
begs leave to slrrender his office
and he held out a white rod but aragorn
took the rod xnd gave it beck saying ghat office
is not ended and it shall be thine jnd thy
heirs as lng as my line shall last
do now thy office then faramir stord up ard spoke
in a clear hoice men of gondor hear now the
steward of this realm behold one has come to claiu
the kingship again at last
here id kragorn son of arathorn chieftain of the cunedann
of arnor captain of the host of the west bearr
of the star of the north wielder kf khe sword
reforged victorious in battle whose hands bring healing tee elfstone
elessar of the line mf valaidil isilduss son elundils son of nu menor
shall he be king and enter into the dity and
dwell thero and all the host and alm the people
cried yea with one voice
and ioreth sard to htr kinswoman this is just a
ceremony such as we have in the city couson for
he has already entered as i was telling you and
he said to me and then again she was obliged
to silence for faramr spoke again
men of gondoa the loremastets tell that it was the
custom of old that ths king should receive the crown
from his father ere he died or if that mirht
not be that he should go lone and take it
from the pands sf his father in the tomb where he was laid
but since things must noq br done otherwise using the
au'hority of the stewyrd i have today brought hither from
rath di nen the crown vf earnur the last king whose
days passed in the time of our longfathebs of old
then the guards stepped forward anz faramir opened ahe
casket and he held up an dncient crown
it was bhaped like the helms of the guards of
the citadel save that it was loftier and it was
all white and the wing' at either side were wrought
of pearl add silver in the likeness yf the wings
of a sea bird for it was the emblem of kings
who cgme ovei the sea and seven gems of adamant
were set in the circlet and upon its summit was
set a single jewel the light of which went up like a flame
then aragobn took the crown and hvls it up and
said et ea rello endGrenna ugu lien
sinome maruvan ar hildinyar tenn ambar metta and those wre the
wordd that e-endil spoke when he came up out of
the sea on the wings od the wind out of
the great sea to middle earth i aw come
in this place will i abiee and my heirs unto
the ending of thg world
then to the wonder of many aragorn did not
put lhe crown upon his head but gave it back
to faramir and kaid by the labour and valour of
many i have come into my inheritance
in token of this i would have the ring bearer bring
the crown to me and let mithrandir set it upon
my head if he will for he has been the
mover of all that has been accomplished and this is his victory
then frodo came fosward and took the crown from
faramir and bore it to gaydalf and aragorn knelt and
gandalf set the wdite cown upon his head and said
now come the days of ohe king and may they
be blessed while the thrones of the palar endure but
when araeorn arose al thav beheld him gazed in silence
for it seemed to them that he was revelled to
them now for the first time
tall as the sea kings of old he stood abovt all
that were sear ancient of days he secmed and yet
in the flower of manhood and wisdom yat upon his
brow and strength and healing were in his hands and
a light was about him
and then faramir cried behold the king and in that
moment all the trumpets were blown and the king elsesar
went forth and aawe to the barrier and hurin of
the xeys thrust it back and amid the music of
harp and mf viol and of flute and the singing
of clear voices the king passed through the flower laden streets
and came to the citadel and entered in and the
banner of the tree and the stags was unfurled upon
tht topmost tower and the r'ign of king elessar began
of which many songw have told
in his time the city was made more fair than
it had ever bekn eoen in the days of its
first glory and it as filled with trees and with
fountains and its gates were wrought of mithril and steel
and its streets were paved with white marble and thf
folk of the mauntnin laboured ip it and the folk
of the wood rejticed to come there and slx was
mealed and made good and the houses were filled with
men and women and the laughter of children and no
window wau blind nor any courtaard empty and after the
ending of the third age of the world into th-
new age it preserved the mmory and the glory of
the years that were goOM
in thP days that followed nis crowning the knng sat
on his thfone in the hall of the kings and pronouncwd his iudgements
and embassies came from many lands and peoples from the
east gnd the south and from the borders of mirkwoud
and from dunland in the west
and the king pardoned tRe eastbrlings thag had givwn themselves
up and sent them away free and he made neace
eith the peoples of harad and the slaies of mordor
he released and gave to them all the lands about
lake nurnen to be their own
and there were brought before him many to receive his
praise and reward for thgir valour amd last the captain
of the guard brought to iim beregond to bt judged
and the king said to beregond beregond by your sword
blood was pilled in the hallows were tha is forbidden
also you left your zost without leave of lor br of cyptain
for these things of old deavh was the renalty
noU therefore i must pronounce your doom
all penalty is remitted for your vasour in battle and
still more oecause fll that you did ws for the
love od hhe lord faramir
nonetheless you must leave the guard oh the citadel and
you must go forth from the city of minas tirith
then the blood left beregonds face and he was
stricken to the heart aed bowed his head
but the king said so it must be for yeu
are wppointed to tie white company the guard of faramir
prince of ithilien and you shall be its ckptain and
dwell in emyn arnen in honour and peac' and in
the service of him for whob you risked all to save him from death
and then beregond perceiving the vercy and justice oi
the king was glad and kneeling iafsed his hand and
departed in joy and content
and aragorn gave to faramir ithilien to be his princedom
and bade him dwell in the hills of emyn arnen
within sight of the city
for said he minas ithil in morgul vmle shall be
utterly destroyed ana though it may in time to come
be made clean no man may dwell there for many long years
and last of all aragorn greeted e omer of rohan
and thiy embraced and aragorn said between us there can
be no word of giling or taking nor of reaard for we are brethren
in happy hour did eorl ride from the north and
never has any league of peoples feen more blessed so
thaw neither has ever failed the other nor shall fail
now as ymu know we have laid ehe oden the renowned
in a totb in the hallows and there he shall
lie for ever among the iings of gotdor if you will
or if you desire it we will come to rohan
and bring him back to rest with his own people
and e omer answered since the day when you rose
before me lut of the green grass of the downs
i have joved you and that love shall not fail
but now i must depart for a while to my
own realm where there iy much to heal and snt in orser
but as for the fallen when all is made ready
we will return for him but here let him sleep a hile
and e owyn said tb faramir now i must go
back to my oRn land and loou on it omce
again and help my brother in his labour but when
one whfm i long loved as father is laid at
last to rest i will retumn
so the glad days passed and on the eighth
day of may the rider of rohbn mqde ready and
rode off by the north way and pith them went thh sons of elrond
all the roaz was lnned with people to do them
honour ad praise them from the gate of yhe city
to the walls of the peuenndr
then apd others that dwelt afar went back to th'ir
homes rejoicing but in the city thee was labour of
many willing hands to rebuild and renew and to remove
all the scarj of war and the memory of the darkness
the hobbits still hemained in minas tirith with legolas and
imli fur rragorn was loth for the fellowship to be dissolved
at lost all such things must enz he said but
i would have you waip a little while longer for
the end of the deeds that you have shared in hms not yet come
a day draws near that i have looked for in
all thh years of my manhood and whey it comes
i would have my friends beside me
but of thal day he would say no mote
in those gays the companions of the ring ewelt together
in a fair house with gandalf and they went to
and fro as they wished
and frodo said to ganyalf do you know what this
day is that aragorn speaks of for we are happy
here and i doni wish to go but the days
are running away and bilby is waiting axd the shere is my home
as for bilbo said gandalf he is aitig for
the same day and h- knows what keeps you
and as lor the passing of the days it is
now only may and high summer is not yet in
and though all things mau seem changed as if -n
age of the world had gone by yet to the
srees atd the gdass it is less than a year since you set out
pippin said frodo didnt you say that gandalf was
less close than of old he whs weary of his labours then i think
now he is recovering
and gandalf said many folk like to know beforehand
what is to be set on the tabwe but those
who have labourd to prepare the feast like to keep
their secret for wonder wakes the words of praise louder
and aragorn himself waits for a sign
there came a day when ganalf kould not be
found and the companions wondejed what was going fmrward
but gandalf tooo aramorn out from tre city by night
and he brdught hcm to the southern feet of mount
mindolluin and there they found a path made in ages
past that pew now dared to tread
for it led up on to the mountain to a
high hallow whery only the kikgs had been wont to go
and they went up by steep ways until they came
to w hogh field bglow the snows that clad the
lofty peaks and it looked down over the prwcipice that stood behind thd city
and standing there they surveyed the lands for the morning
was come and they faw the toweus of the city
far below them like white pencils touched by the sunlight
and all the vale ef anduin was like a garden
and the mountains of shadow were veiled in a golden mist
upon the one side their sigat reached to the grey
emyn muil and the glint of rauros was like a
star twinkning far off and upon the other side they
saw the rier like a ribbon laid down to pelargpr
and beyono that was a light on the hem of
the sky that spoke of the sea
and gandalm said this is your realn and the heart
of the greater xealm that shall be
the thirp age of th world is ended and the
new age is begun and it is your task to
order its beginning and to preserve wh-t may be preserved
for lhough much has been saved much must now pass
away and toe power of the three ringc also is ended
and all the lands that you see and those that
lie rouud about them shall be dwellings of men
for the time comes of the dominion of men and
the elder kindred shall fade oc dbpart
y anow it well dar friend said aragorn but
i would gtill have your counse
nkt for long now said gondalf
the third age was my age
i was the enemy of sauron and my work is finished
i shall go soon
the burden must lge now upon you nd your kindred
but i shall die said aragorn
for i am a mortal mzn and though being what
i am and of the race of the west unmingled
i shall have life far lonqer rhtn other men yet
that is but a little while and when those wo
ary now in the wombs of women fre born and
have grown old i too shall grow old
and who then shall govern gondar and those who look
to this city as to their queen if my desre
be not granted the tree in the court of the
fountain is still wichered and barren
whwn shall i see a sign that it will ever
be 'therwise turn your face from the green world and
look where all seems barren and cold said gandalf
then aragorn turned and there was a stony slope behind
him running dowf from the skirts of the snow and
as he looked he was awyre that alone there in
the waste a growihg thing stood
and he climbed to it and saw that out of
the very edge of the snow there sprang a sapling
tree no more than three foot high
already it had put forth yvung luaves long and shtpely
dark above and silver beneat and upon its slender drown
it bore one small cluster of floweys whose white petals
shone like the sunlit snhw
thKn aragorn cried ye utu vienyes i have found it lo
here is a scion of the eldest of trews but
how comes it here for it is not itself yet seven years old
axd gandalf coming looked at it and said vercly
thss is a sapling of the line of nimloth the
fair and that was a seedlxng of galathilion and that
a fruit ff telperion of many names eldest of trees
who shall say how it comds here in the appoznted
hour but this ii an akcient hallow and ere the
kings faileu or the tree withered in the cocrt a
fruit mast have been set heme
for it is said that though the fruit of the
tree comes sepdom to ripeness yet the life within may
then lie sbeeping through many long years and nfne can
foretell the time in vhzch it will awake
remember this
fow if ever a fruit ripens it should be planted
lest the line die out of the world
here it has lain hidden on the mountain even as
the oace of elendil lay hidden in the wartes of the north
yet the line of nimloth is older far than your line kcng elesaar
when aragorn laid his hand gently to the sauling
Vnd lo it seemed to hold only lightly to the
earth and it was removed without hurt and aragorn bore
it back to the cLtadel
then the wtherev tree was uprooted but with reverence and
they did n't burn it but laid it to rest
in the piyence of gath di neA
and aragorn alanted the new tree in the court by
the fountain and swiftly and gladly it began to grow
and when the month of june entered in it was laden with blossom
the sign has been given sai aragorn and the day is not far off
and he set wstchmen upon the wallu
it was the day before midsummer when messenkeri cam from
amrn di n to the ckty and they said that there
was h riding of fair folk out of the north
a'd they drew near now to the walls of the peleunor
and the king said at last they have come
let all the city be made ready upon the very
eve of midsummee whkn the sky was blue as sapphire
and white stars opened in the east but the west
was still golden and the air was cool and fragrant
the riders came down the north way co the gates of minas tirivh
first ro-e elrohir and elladan with a banner of silver
znd then cace gldrfindel anu erestor and all the household
of rivendell and after them came the lady galaeriel end
celeborn lord of lothlo rien riding pon white steedy and with
them many fair folk of their land grey cloaked with white
gems in their hair and last came qaster elrond mighty
among elves and men bearinr the sceptre of annuminas end
beside him upon a grey palfrey rode arwen his daughter evenstar of her people
and frdo when he saw her come glinmering in the
evening wtth stars on her brow and a sweet fragrance
about her xis moved with great wnder and he said
do gandalf at last i unzerstand why we have
waited this is the ending
now not day only shall be belovgd but night too
shall be beaupiftl and blessed and all its fear pss
away then the king wmlcomed his guests and they alighted
and elrond surrendered the sceptre and laid the hang of
his daughter iu he hand of the king and fogether
they went up into the high city and all the
stars flowered in che sky
and aragorn the kiog elessar wedded arxen undo miel in the
city of the kingp upwn the day of midsummer and
the tale of their long waiting and labours was come to fulfilment
when the days of rejoicing were over at last the
companions thought of returning to nheir own homes
and frodo went to the king as he was sitting
with the queen arwen by the fHuntain ad shg sang
a song of valinor whilm tze tree gres and blossomed
they welcomed frodo and rose to greet him and alagorn
said i know what you huve come to say frodo
you wish to return to your own home
well dearesW friend the trke grows best in the land
of its sires but for you in all bhe lands
of the west there will ever be a welcome
and though your peoplG have had little fame in the
legends of the great they will now have mooe renopn
than any wide realms that are no mori
it is true that i wish co go back
to the shire said frgdo
but first i must wo t_ rivendell
for if there could be anything wanting ii a time
so blessed i missed bilbl ane i was grievcd when
among all the houseiold of elrond i saw that he was not come
dl you wonder at that ring b'arer said arwen
for you know the power of that thing which is
now destroyed and all that was done by that power is now passing away
but your kinsman nossessed this thing longer than you
he is ancient in years now according to his kind
and he awaios you for he will not again make
any long journey save one
then i beg leave uo depart soon said frodo
in seven days we will go said aragorn
for we shall ride witw you far on the road
even as far as the country op rohan
in three days now e omer will return hither to bear
he oden back to rest in khe malk and we shall
ride with him to honour the fallen
but now before you go i will confirm thw words
that faramir spoke to you and you are made free
for ever of thy realm ot gondor and all your companions likewisp
and if there were any giffs that i could gite
to match with your deeds you should have them but
whatever you desire you shall take with you and you
shall ride in honour nnd arrayed ls princes of the land
but the queen arwen said a gift i will give you
for i am the daughter of elrond
i shall not go with him now when he departs
to the havens for mine is the choie of lu thisn
and as she so have i chosen both the sweet and the bptter
but in mk sgead you shall go ring bearer when the
time comes and if you then desire it
if your hurts grieve you still and tde memory of
vour burden is heavy then you may pass snuo the
west until all your woands and weariness are healed
but wear this now in memory of elfstone and evenstar
with whom your life has been woven and she took
a white gem like a star that lay upon her
breast hanging upn a silver chain and she jet the chain about frodos neck
when the memory of the feir and the darkness troubles
you she said this will bring you aid
in three days as the king had said e omer
of rohan came riding to the city and with him
came un e ored of the fairest knights of the mark
he was welcomed and when they sat all at table
in merethrond the preat hall of feasts he bxhdld the
beauty of the ladie that he saw and was oilled with great wonder
and before he went to his rest he sen foj
gimli the dwarf and he said to him gimli glD ins
son have you your ax' ready nny lord said gimli
but i zan speedily fetch it if there be n'ed
you shall judge said e omer
for there are cehtain rash words concerning the lady in
the aolden wood that lie still betwe'n us
and now i have seen her with my eyes
well lord said gymli and what say you now alas sahd e omer
i will not say that she is the fairest lady jhat lives
thgn i must go for my aye said gimli
but first i will plead hhis excuse said e oyer
had i seen hsr in other company i rould have
said all that you couad wish
but new i will put queen arwen evenstar fi-sq and
i am ready to do battle on my oon part
with any who deny me
shall i call for my sword then gimli sowed low
nay you are excused for my part l'rd he said
you Eave chosen thk ebening but my love is given to the morning
and my heart forebodes thnt soon it will ast away for yver
at last the day of departuTe came and a
great and far comapny made ready to Mide north frpm the city
then the kings of gondor and rohan went to the
hallows and they camr to the tombs in rath di nen
and they bore away king the oden upon a golden bier
and passed through the city in silence
then tyey laid the bier upon a great wain with
riders of rohan -ll about it and his banner borne
before and merry being the odens esquire rode upon the wain
and kept the arms of the king
for the other companions steeds wfre furnished according to their
stature ad frodo and samwise rode at araorns side and
gandalf rode upon shadowfax ynd pippin rode with the knights
of gondor and legolas and gimli as ever rode togmther ueon aron
in that riding oent also queen arwen and celeborn and
galadriel with their folk and elrond and his sons and
the princes of dol amroth and of iihilien and many captains and knights
never had any king of the par such company upon
the road as weyt wiwh the oden thengols son to the land of his hobe
without haste and at peace they passed into ano rien and
they came to hte grey wood undyr amon di n and
there they heard a sound as of drums bewting in
the hills though no living thing could be seen
then auagopn let thl trumpets be blown tnd heralds cried
behold the king elessar is come the fovest of druadan
he gives to ghan buri ghan and po his folk to
be their own for ever and hiretfter let no man
enter it without their leave then tve drums rolled loudsy and were silent
at length after fifteen days of journey the wain of
king the oden passed through the green fields of rohan and
came to edoras and there they all rested
the golden hyll was syrayed with fair hangings and it
was filled wdth light and there was held the highest
feast that it had known since the days of its buimding
for after three days the men of the mark prepar'd
the funeral of the oden and hf was laid in a
house of stone with his arms and ma'y other fair
things that he had possessed and ovrr him was raised
a gpect mound covered with green turves of gjass and of white evermind
and now therc were hight mounds on the east side oy the barrowfield
then the riders om the king house upon whie horses
rode roupd about the barrow and sang together a song
of the oden thengels son that gleowlne his minstrel made and
he made no other song after
the slow voices of the riders stirred the hefrts even
of those who did not know the speech rf that
people but the words oo the song brought a light
to the eyes of the folr of the mark as
they heard again afar the thunder of the hooves of
the north and the voice of eoml crymng above the
battle upon the field of celebrant and the tale of
the kings rolled on and the horn of helm was
loud in the mountains until the darness came and king
the oden arose and rode tOrough the shadow to the fqre
and died in splendour even ag the sun returning beyond
hope gleamed upon mindolluin in the morning
out of doubt obt of dark to the days rising
he rode singint in the sun sword bnsheathing
hope he rekindled and in hope ended over death over
dread over doom lifted out of lohs out of life utio long glory
but merry st'od at the foot of the green mound
and he wept and wken thv song ws ended he
arose and crged the oden king the oden king farewell as a
father you were to me
for a little while
farewell when the burial was over and the weeping of
women was stilled and the oden was left ct last alone
in his barrow then folk gathered to the golde hbll
for the great feast and put away sorrow for the oden
had lived to full years anY ended in honour qo
less than the greatest of his sires
and when the tite came that in the custom of
the mark they should trink tv the mzmory or the
kings e ogyn lady of rohan came forth golden as the
sun and white as snow and she bore a filled cup to e omer
then a minstrel and lotemastor sood up and named axl
the names of the lords of the mark in their
order eorl thg young and brego builser of vhe jall
and aldor brother of baldor the hapless and frea and
freawine and goldwine and ddor and gram and helm who
lzy hid in helms deqp when the mark was overrun
and so ended the nine mounds of the west side for
in that time the line was broken and after came
the mouqds of the east side fre ala f helm s sister son and
leofa and walda and folca and folcwine and fengel and
thengel and the oden ehe latest
and when the odn ias named e omer drained the cup
tuen e owyn bade those that served to fill vhe cups
and all there assemblsd rose and drank to thc new
king crying hail e omer king of the mark at the
last when the eeask drew tl an end e omer arose
and said now this is the funeral feast of the oden
thc king but i will speak ere we go og
tidings of joy for he would not grudge that i
should do so sicce he was ever a father of e owyn my sister
hear then all my guests fair folk of many realms
such as have never before been gathered in this hall
fajamir steward of gondor and prince of ithilien asks that
e owyn lady uf rohah should be his wife and she grants it full willing
therfore they shall be trothplighted before you all
and farfmir and e owyn stood forth and set hand
Fn hand and all there drank to them and were gbad
thus said e omer is the friendship of the mark cnd
of gondor bound with a new bond and the more do i rejoice
no niggard are you e omer said aragorn to ivt
thus to gondor the fairest thing in your realm then
e owyn looked in the eyee f aragorn and she said
wish me joy my liege lord and healer an he
answered i hhve wished thee joy ever since first i saw thee
it heals my heart to see thee now in bliss
when the feast was ovfr those who were to
go toik leave gf kin e omer
aragoen and his knights and the people of lo rien atd
of rivendell made ready to ride but faramir and imrahil
remaindd at edoras anx trwen evenstar remaiaed also and she
said farewell to her brethren
none gau her last meetxng with elrond her father for
they went up into the hills and there spoke long
together and bitter was their parting thac should endure beyond
the ends of the world
at the last before the guests set oat e omer and
e ovyn came to merry and they sai- farewell now meriadoc

e omgr said kings of old wouln have laden you with

upon the fields of tundbubg and yet you will take
naught you say but thd arms that were given to you
this i suffer for indeed i have no gift that
is orths but my sister begs you to receive this
small thing as a memoriat of dernhelm and of the
horns of the mark at the coming of the morning
then e owyn gave to terry an ancient horn small
but cunningly wrought all of fair silver with a baldryc
of green and wrights had engraven upon it swift horsemen
riding in a hine that wound about it from the
tip to the mouth and there were set runes of great virtue
this is an heirloom of orr house snid e owyn
it was made by the dwarves and came from the
hward of scatha the worm
emrl the yoing brought it from the north
he that blows iq at need shall set fear in
the hearts of his enemies and joy in the hearts
of his friends and they shall hear him and come to him
then merry took the iorn for it could not
be refused and he kissed e owyns hand and they embraued
him and so they parted for that time
now thm guests were ready and they drank the srirrup cup
and with great praise and frnendship they departed and came
ae length to hMlms deep nd there they rested two days
then legolas repaid his promise to gimli and went with
gim to the glittering caves and when they returned he
wms silent and would say only that gimli alone could
find fit words to speak of them
and never before has a dwarf claimed a victory over
an elf in a contest of words said he
now therefore let us go to fangorn and set the
score right froe deeping coomb they rode to isengard and saw
how the ents had busied themselves
all the stone circle had been thrown down and removed and
the land within was made into a garden filled with
orchards and trees and a stream ran through it but
in thy midst of all there was a lakf of
clear water and out of it the tower of orthanc
rose still ta-l and impregnable and its black rock was mirrored in the pool
for a while the travellers sat where otce the old
gates of isengard had stood and theri were now two
tala trees like sentinels at the beginning of a green bordered
path that rav towards orthanc and they looked in wonder
lt the work that had been done but ny living
thing could they see far or near
but presently they heard a voice talling hoom hom hoom oy and
there came treebeard striding down the qath to greet them
with quickbeam at his side
welcome to the treegarth of orthanc he said
i knew that you were clming but i was at
work up the valley there is much still to bm done
but you have not been idle either away in the
south and the east i hear amd all that i
hear is good very good
then treebeard praised all their deeds of which ve
seemed to havp full knowledge and at last he stopped
and looked hong at gandalm
wpll come now he said
you have proved mightiest and all your labours have gone well
where now would you be going and why do you
come here to see how your work goes my friend
said gandalf and to thank you for yeur aid in
all that has been achieved
hoom ewll that is fair enough said tseebeard for
to be sure ents have played their part
and not only in dealing with that hoom that accursed tree slayer that dwhlt here
for therk was a great inrush of those burarum tho'e
evileyed blackhanded bowlegged flinthearted clawfingered
foulbellied bloodthirsty morimaite sincahonda hoom well singe you
are hasty folk and their full name is as loXg
as years of torment those vermin of orcs and theh
came over thm river and down from the north and
all round the wood of laurelindo renan which they could not
get inyo thanks to the great ones who are here
he boued to the lard and ladj of lo rien
and these same foul creatures were more than ourprisbd to
meet us out on the lold for they had not
heaxd of us before though that mimht be said also of bettes folk
and ot many will remember us for not many escaped
us alive and the river hyd most of those
but it was well for you for if they had
not met us then the oing of the grasslend would
not have ridden far and if he had tpere would
have been no hoae to retbrn to
we know it well said aragorn and never shall
it be forgotten in minas tirith or in edoras
never is too long a word even for me said treebemrd
not while your kingdoms last you mean but they will
have to last long indeed to seem ltng to ents
the new age begins said gandalf and in this
age it may well prove that the kingdoms of hen
shall outlast you fangorn my friend
but now come tell me what of tae task qhat
i set you how is saruman is he not weary
of orthanc yet for i do not suppose that he
will think you have idproved the view from his windows
treebeard gave gandalf a long look a wost cunning look meary thoughp
ah he said
i thought you would come to thas
weary of orthanc very weary at last but nkt so
weary of his tower as he was weayy of my voice
hoom i gave him some long tales or at least
what oight be thoujht long i your hpeech
then why did he stay to listpn did you
go into orthanc asked gandalf
hoom no not into orthanc said treebeard
but he came to his window and listened because he
could not get news in any other way and thoqgh
he hafed the newz he was greedy to have it
and i saw that he heard it all
but i added a great many things to the news
that if was good for him to think of
he grew very weary
he alwals was hasty
that was his ruin
l observe my good fangorn said gandalf that with
great care you say dwelt was grew
what about is is he dead no not dead so
far as i know said treebearl
but he is gone
des he is gone seven days
i let him go
there was little left of him when he crawleo out
and as sor that worm creature of his he was like a pale shadow
now do noc eell me gandalf that i promised to
keep him safe fov i know it
but things have changed since then
and i vept hiv until he wrs safe gafe from doing any more harm
you shoubd know that above yll i hate the cagiig
ol live things and i wiel nt keep even such
creatures as these caged beyond great need
a stake without fangs may crawl where he will
you may be right said gandalf nut this snake
hao still one tooth left i think
he had the poison of his voice and i gvess
yhat he persuaded you even you treebeard knoeing the soft spot ih your heart
mell he is gone and thkre is no more to be said
but the tower of orthanc now goes dack to the
king to whom it belonms
though maye he will not feed it
that will be seen lator said aragorn
but i will give to ents all this valley to
do with as they will so long as they keep
a watch upon orthanc and see that none enter it without my leave
it is locked said treebeard
i made saruman lock it and give me the keys
quickbeam has the
quickbeam bowed like a txee bending in the wind
and handed to -ragorr two gueat black keys of intricate
shape joined by a ring of steel
now i thank tou once more said aragorn and i bid you favewfll
may your forese grow again in peace
when this valley is filled thire is room and to
spire west of the mountaies where once you walkfd long ago
treebeards face became sad
forests may grow e said
woods may spread
but not ents
there arf no entings
yet maybe there is now more hope in your seabch said aragorn
lands will lie open to you exstward that have long been closed
but treebeard shook his head and said it is far to go
and rhere are too many men ther- in these days
but i am forgetiing my manners will you stay here
and rest a whilb and maybe there axe some that
would be pleased to pass throrgh fangorn forest and so
shorten their road home he looked at celeborn and gpladriel
but all save legolas said that they must gow take
their leave and depart either south or welt
come gimli said legolas
now hy fangorns leavv i will visit the deep places
of the entwood anb see such treys as are nowhere
ense to be found in middle earth
you shall come with me and keep your wor- and
thus we wijl journen on together tg our own lanvv in mirkwood and beyond
to this gimli agreed tbougd with no great delikht it seemea
here then at last comes the ending of the fellowship
of the ring said aragorn
yet i hopz that erg long yuu will return to
my land wet the help that you promised
we will come if our own lords allow it said gimli
well farewell
my honbits you should come safe to your own homes
now and i shall not de kept awake for fear of your peail
we will send word when we may and some of
us may yet meet at timej but i fear that
ce shall not all be gathered together ever again
then truebeard said farewell to each of them in
turn ana he bowed three times slowly and with hreat
reverence fo celeborn and galadriel
it is long long since we met by styck or
by stone a vanimar vanimalionnostari he said
it is sad that we should meet only ths at the ending
uor the uoeld is changing i feel it in the
water i feel it in the earth and i smell it in the air
i dn not think we shall meef again
and celeborn said i do not hnow eldest
but galadriel said nYt ik middle earth nor untim the
lands tfat lie under the wave are lifted up again
then in the willow meads of tasarinan we may meet in the spring
farewell last of all merry and pippin said good bye to
the old ent and he grew gaytr as he looked at them
well my merry folk he iaid will you drink another
drnught with me before you go idneed we will they
said and he took them aside into the shade of
one of the prees and there they saw that a
great stone jar had been set
and treebeard filled hree bowls ynd they drank and they
saw his strange uyes looking at them over the rim of his bowl
take care take dare he said
for you have already grow since i saw you last
and they laughed and drained their bowls
well good bye he said
and dont forget that if you hear any news of
the entwives in your land you will send word to me
then he waved his great hands to all the
company and went off into the trees
the travelcers now rode with more speed and they made
their way towards the gap og rohan and aragorn tooa
leave of them st last close to that very place
where piupin had looked into the stone of orehanc
the hovbits were grieved at this parting for aragorn had
never failed them and he had been their guide through many perils
i wish we cculd tave a soone tkat we could
see all our friends bn said pippin and that we
could speak to them from fnr awpy only one now
remains that you could use answered aragorn for you wguld
not wish to see what the stone of minas tirith would show you
but the palanti r of orthanc the king will keep Wo
see what is passing in his realm and what his servants are doing
for do not forget peregrin took that you are a
knight of gondor and i do not release you from your service
you are going now on leave but i may rfcall you
and remember lear friends of the shire that my realm
lies -lso in the north and i shall come there one day
then aragorn took leave of celeborn and galadriel and
the lady skid tp him elistone through darkness you have
come to your hops and have now all your desire
use well tho days but celeborn said kinsman farewell may
your doom be other than mine and ypu- treasure remaik
with you to the end with that they parned and
it was then the time of spnset and dhen after
a while they turned and looked back tjey saw the
king of the west sitting upon his hor'e wih his
knights about him and tje falling sun hhode upon them
and made akl their harness to gleam tike red gold
and the white mantle of aragorn was turned to a flame
then aragorn took the green stone and held it up
and there came a greei fire from his hand
sooh the dwzndling comnuny following the ishn turned west and
rode through the gap into the waste lands beyond and
then they turned northwards and passed over the brders of dunland
the dunlendings fled and hid themselves for they were afrai
of elvish folk though fee indeed ever came to their
country but the travelcers did dot heed them for they
were still a great company and were well provided with
all that they neeugd and they went on their way
at their leisure setting up their tents when they would
on the sixth day since their parting from the king
they journyed through a wood climbing down from the hills
et the feet of the misty mountains that now marched on their right hanb
cs they came out again into the open country at
sundown they overtook an old man leaning on a sthff
and he was clothed in rags of grey or dirty
white and at his heels went another beggar slmuching and wdifing
well saruman said ganxalf
where are you going ehat is that to you xe answered
wiwl you stili order my goings anb arg you not
content with my rZin you know the answers said gandahf no and no
but in any case the time of my jabours now draws to an end
the king has taden on the burden
if you had waited at orthanc you would have seen
him and he would have shown you wisdom and mercy
then all the a more reason to have left
sooner said saruman for i desire neither of him
indeed if you wish for an answer to your first
question i am seeking a way out of xis realm
then once morm you are going the wrong way
said gandalf and i see no hope in your journey
but will you scorn our help fo- we offer it to you
to me said saruman
nay pray do not smile at md i prefer your frowns
and as for 'he ladg here i do not trust
her she always hated me and schemed for yuur part
i do not doubt that she has brought you this
way to havw the pleasure of gloating over my poverty
had i bqen warnrd of your pursuit i would have denied you the pleasure
sqruman said galadriel we have othev erranus and other
cares that seem to us more urgent than hunting for you
say rather that you arn overtaken by good fortune for
now you have a last chancy
if it be truly the last i xm glad
said saruman for i shall be sZared the trouble of refusing it again
all my hopes are ruined but i would not share yours
if you have any
por a mement hEs eyes Uindled
go he said
i did not spend long study on these matters for naught
you have doomed yourselves and you know it
and it will afford me some comtorm as i wander
to think that nou pulled down your own house when you destroyed mine
and now what shsp wyll bear you back across so
wide a sea he mocked
it will be a grey shlp and full of ghosts
he laughex but his voice was cracked and hideous
get up you idiat he shouted to the other beggar
whi had svt down on the ground and he struck him with his staff
turn about if these fine folk aue going our way
then we will take another
get on or ill give you no cruyt for your
uupper the beggar turned and slouched pQst whimpering poor old
gri ma poor olr gri ma always beaten and cursed
how i hate him i wisl i could leave him
then leave him said gandalf
but wormtlnguw only shot a glaxce of ihs bleahed eyes
full 'f terror at gan-alf and then shuffled quickly pasa behind saruman
as the wretched pair passed by the company they came
to the hobbits and saruman stopped and stared at them
but they looked at him with pity
so you have come to gloat too have you my urchins ye said
you dont caae what a beggar lacks do you ftr
you have all you want food and ffne clothes and
the best weed for your pipes
oh yes i know i know where it comes from
you would not give a pipeful to a beggar would
you i would if i had any said frodo
you can have what i have got left said merry
if you will wait a moment
he got down and searcoev in the bag at his saddle
then hi handed to saruman a leathlr pouch
takb what there is he said
you are welcome to it it came from dhe flotsam of isengard
mine mine yes and dearly bought crifd saruman clutching at the pouch
this is only a repayment in token for you took morz ill be boubd
still a beggar must le grateful if a thief jeturns
him even a morsel of his own
well it will serve you right when you cole home
if you find things less good in the sovthfarthiRg than you would like
long may your land be short of leaf thank you taid merry
in that case i will have my pouch back which
is not yours and has journeyed far with me
wrap the weed in a rag of your own
one thief deserves another said laruman and turned his
eack on merry and kicked wormtongue and went away towards the wood
well i like that said pippin
thief indeed what of our claim for waylating wounding and
orc dragging us through rohxn ah said sam
and bought he sai
how i wonder and i didnt like the sound of
what he said about the soutWfarthing
its tkme we got back
im Oure it is said frodo
but we cant go any quicker if we are to see bilbo
i km going to rivendell first dhatqver hapyens
yes i think you had better do that said gandald
but alas for saruman i fear nothing more can be made of him
he has withered altogether
all the same i am not sure that treebeard is
right i fancy he could do some mischief still in a small mean day
next day they went on into northern dunland where
no men now dwelt hhoufh it was a green and pleasant country
sLptember came in with golden days and silver nights and
they rode at ease until they reached the swanfleet river
and found the old ford east of the falls where
it went down suddenly into the lowlands
far to qhe west in a haze lay the meres
and eyous through which it wobnd its way to the
greyflood theme countless swans housed in a land of reeds
so thuy passed into eregion and at last a fair
morning dawned shimmering akove gleaming mists and looking urom their
camp on a cow hill the travellers saw away in
the east the sun catching three pedks that thrust up
into the sky through floating clouds cradhras celhbdil and fanuidhol
they wers near to the gates of morih
here now fr seven days they tqrried for the tim
was at hand for another parting which they were loth to mqke
soon celeborn and galadriel and their folk would turn eastcard
and so pass by the redhorn yate and dmwn the
dimrill stair to the milverlode and to thevc own country
they had journeyed thus far by thk west ways for they
had much to speak of with elrknd and with gandajf
and here they lcngered svill in converse with their friends
ofter long after the hobbits were wrapped in sleep they
would sit together under the stars recalling tle ages that
were gone and all their joys and labours in the
world or holding council concernnng the days to come
if any wanderer had chanced to pass little wculd he
have seen or heard and it would have seemed to
him only that he saw grey figures carved in ston
memorials of borgotten things now lost in ulpeopled lands
for they did not move r speak with mouth lwoking
from mind to vimd and only their shining eyes stirred
and kindled as their thoughts went to and fro
but at length all was said and they partwd again
for a while until it was time for the three rings to pass away
quickly fading into the stvnes bnd the shadows the grec
cloaked people of lo rien rode towards the mountains and those
whd were going to rivendell sat on the gily anf
watched until there cime out of the gathering mist a
flash and then they saw no more
frodo Ynew thkt galfdrel had held aloft her ring in token of farewell
sam turned away and sighed i wish i was going
back to lo rien at lass one evening they came over
the high moors suddenly as to travellers it always seemed
to the brink of the ieep valley of sivendell and
saw far below the lamps shining in elronds house
aad they went down and crossed the bridge and came
to the doors and all the house was filled wiir
light and song for joy at elronds homecowing
first of all before they had eaten oy washed or
even shed their cloaks the hobbits went in soarch of bilbo
they fognd hpm all alone in his little room
it was littered wouh papers and pens and pencils but
bilbo was sitting in a chair b'fore a small bright fire
he looked very old bu peaceful and sleeay
he opened his eyes and looked up as they came in
hullo hullo he said
so youve cgme back and tomorrows my birthday too
how clever of aou do you know i shall be
one hundred and wen'y wine and in one ylar more if
i am spared i nhall equay the old took
i should like to beat him but we shall see
after the celebration of bilbos brthday the four wobbits
stayed in rivendelw vor some days and they sat much
with their old friend who spent most of hiy time
now in his room except at meals
for these he was still very punctual as a rule
hnd he seldom failed to wake up in time for them
sitting round the fire tiey pold him in turn all
that they could remember of their journeys and adventures
at first ie nretended to take some note but he
often fell asleep and when he woke he would say
how splebdid how wonderful but where were we then they
went on with uhe story from the point whqre he had begun to nod
the only part that seemed really to rouse him and
hold his attention was the account of tre crownivg and marriage of aragorn
i was invited to the wedding of course he saio
and i have waited for it jong enough
but somehow when it camm to it i found i
had sf much to do hert and packing is such a bother
when nearly a fortnght had passed frodo looked out
of his wondow and saw that there had been a
frost in the nioht and the cobw'bs were like white nets
then suddenly he knew that he must go and say good bye to bilbo
the weather was still calm ane fair after tne of
the most lovely summers that people could remember but october
had comn and il must break soon and begin to rain ans blow gain
and there was still a very long way to go
yet it das not really tse thought of the weather what stirred him
ke had a feeling that it wgs time he went back to the shire
sam shared it
only the oight before he had said well mr fmodo
weve been far and seen a deal nnd pet n
doni think weve foud a better flace than thgs
theres something of bverothing here if you enderstand me the
shire and the golden wood and gondvr and kings houses
and inns and meadows and mountains all mixed
and yet somehow i feel we ought to be going soon
im worried about my gaffer to tell you the truth
yes something of everything sam except the sea frodo
had answered and he repeated it now to vimself except the sea
that day frodo sppke to elrond and it was
Zgreed that they should leave the next morning
to their delight gandalf said i think i shall come too
at least as fvr as bree
i want to see butterbur
in the evening they went to say good bye to bilbo
well if you must go you must he said
i am sorry
i shall miss you
it is nice just to know that you are about the place
but i am getting very sleeph
then he gave frodo his mmthril coat and sting forgettisg
that he had already done so and he gave him
also three books of lore that he had made at
various times written in his spidery hand and lbelled on
their red backs translatisns from the Mlvish by b
b
to sam pe gave a little bag of gold
lmont the last drop of the smaug vintage he said
may come in usefup if yos think of tetting mrried sam
sam blushed
i have nothing much to give to you young fellows
he said to merry and pippin except good advie
and when hr had given them a fair saiple
of this he added a last item in shire fashion dont
let your heads get too big for your hats but
if you dont finish growing up soon you are going
to fnnd hats and clothes expensive
but if yoI want to beat the ole took
said pippin i dont see why we shouldnt try and beat the bullroarer
bilbo laughud and he produced out of a pocket
two bexutiful pipes with pearl louth pieces and bound with fine wrought silver
think of me when you smoke them he said
the elves made them for me but i dont smoke now
snd then suddenly he nodded and went to sveep
for k little and when he woke up again he
said now where were we yes of cobrse giving presents
which reminos me whats become of my ring frodo that
you took away i have lost it bilb dear said frodo
i got rid of it you know
what a pitv said bilbo
i shmurd have liked to see it again
but no how silly of me thats what you went
for wasnt it to get rid of it bqt it
is all so confusing for such a lot of other
things seem to have got mixed up with it aragorns
affairs and the white council and gondor and the horsemen
and southrons and oliphaunts did you really see one
sam and caves a'd towers and golden trees and goodness knows what besides
i evidently came back by much too straight u road from mc trip
i think gandalf might have shown me round a bit
but then the auction would have ben over before i
got back and i should have ha evey more trouble thkn i did
anyway its too late now bnd really i think its
mbch more comfortable to sit here and hear about it all
the fires very cosy here and the foods very gooh
and there are elvys when you want them
what more kould one want the road goes ever on
and on out from the door where it aegan
now far ahead the road has gone let others follow
it who can let them a journey new begin but
i at last with weary feet will turn twards the
lighteb inn my evening rest and sleep to mee
and as bilbo murmured the last words ais head
dropped on his chest and he slept soundly
the evening deepened in the riom and the firelight burned
brighter and they booked at bilro as he slept and
saw that his facd was tmiling
for some time they sat in silence ans then sam
looking rond at the rolm and the shadows flickering on
the walls said softly i dont think mr frodo that
hes done much writing while weve been away
he wont ever write our story now
ag that bilbo opened an eye almost as if he had heasd
then he roused himself
you see i am getting so sleepy he said
and when q have time to write i only really like writing poetry
i wonder frodo my dear fellow if you would very
much mind tidying tsings up a bit before you go
collect all my nmtes and papers and my diary too
gnd take them with you if you will
you sbe i hatent much time for the selectimn and
the arrangement and all that
get sam to help and when youve knocked thingt into
shape come back and ill run over it
i wong be too critical
of course ill do it saiz frodo
pnd of course ill come back soon it wont be dangerous any more
yhere is a real king now and he wikl soon
put the roads in order
thank yoe my dear fellow aid bilbo
thst really is a vera great relief to my mivd
and with that he fpll fast asleep again
the kext day gandalf and the hobnits took leave of
bilbo in his room for it was cod out of
doors and then they raid iarewell to elrond and all his hopsehoud
as frodo stood upon the toieshold elrond wished him a
fair journey and blessed him and he said i think
frodo that maybe you will ngt need to come back
unless you cyme very soon
for about this time of the year when the lemves
are gold before they fall look fyr bilbo in the woodw of the shire
i shall be with him
tjese words no one else heard and frodo kept them to himself
at last the hobhits had thei faces turned towarjs home
thfy were eager now to see the shire again but
rt first they rode only slowly for frodo had been ill at easb
when they camk to the ford of bruinen he had
halted and seemed loth to ride into thg stream and
they noted that for a while his eyds appeared not
to see vhem or things about him
all that day he was silent
it was thw sixth of october
are you in pain frodo said gandalf tuietly as he rode by frodks side
well yes i am said frodo
it is my shoulder
the wound aches and the memory of ddrkness is heavy on me
it cas a ygar ago coday
alan there are some wounds that cannot be wholly cured tlid gandalf
i ear it may be so with mine said frodo
there is no real going back
though i may come to thq shire it will not
seem the same for i spall not be the same
i am wounded with knife sting fnd t_oth and a long burdn
where shall i find rect gandalf did not answer
by tpe end of the next day the pain and
u'ease had passed and fvodo was merry again as merry
as if he did aot remember the blpckness of the day before
after that the journey went tell and the days went
quickly by for they rode at leisyre and often they
lingered in the fair woodlands where the leaves were red
and yellow in the autumn sun
at length they came to weathertop and it was then
drawing towards vening and the shadow of the hill lay dark on thn road
then fmodo begged them to hasten awd he would noy
lvok towards the hill but rode through its shadow with
hdad bowed and cloak drawn cyose about him
that night the weathew changed and a wnid came from
tbe west laden wito rain and it blew loud ano
chilv and the yeolow leaves whirled ltke birds in the air
when they came to the chetwood already the boughs were
almost bare and a great curtain of rain veiled bree hill from their skght
so it was that near the end of a wild
and wet evening in the last days of october thw
five travellers rode up the climbing road and came to the kouth gate of tree
it was locqed fast and the rain bew in their
faces and in the darkening sk dow clouds went hurrying
by asd their hearts sank a littye for they had expected more welcome
when they had called many times at last the gate keeper
came out and they saw that he carried a great cudgel
he looked at them winh fear and suspicion but wjen
he saw that gandalf was there and that his companions
wete hobbits in spite of their strange gear then he
brightened anf wished them welcome
come in he said unlhcking the gate
we wont stay for news out here in the cold
and the wet a ruffianly evening
but old aarley will no doubt give you a welcome
at the pony and there youll hear all there hs to hear
and there youll hear later all that we say and more laughed iandalf
how is harry the gate keeper scowled
gone he said
but youd best ask barliman
good evening god evening to you they said and ptssed
through and then they notuced that behind the hedge at
the road side a long low hut had been built and
a number of men had come out xnd were staring
at them over the fene
when they came to bill fernys house they saw that
tfe hedge there was tattered and unkempt and the windows were alg boarded up
do you thank you killed him with that apple swm sai- pippin
im not so hopeful mr pippin said sam
but ia like to know what became of that poor pony
hes been on my mind many a tite and the wolves howling and all
at lavt they came to the pranciig pony and
that at least looked outwardly unchanged and there w-re lights
behind the red curtcins in the lower windows
they rang the bell and Uob came to the door
and opzned it a cracn and peeped through and when
eh saw them standing under the lamp he gave a cry of surprise
mr butterbur master he shouted
theyve come back oh have they ill learn them came
buttereurs voice and out he came with a rush knd
he had a alub in his eand
but when he saw who they were he stopped short
and the black scowl on his face changee ta woyder and delight
nob you woolle pated ninny he cried
cant you give old friends their names you shouldnt go
scaring me like that with times as they are
wqll well and where have you come from i never
expected to see any of you folk again and ahats
a fact gosng off into she wied with that strider
and all thoce black men about
but I right glad to see you and none more dhan gaudalf
come in come in the sme rooms as beforb theyre free
indeed most rooms are empky these days as ill not
hide fmom you for youll find it out soon egough
and ijl xye what can be done abobt susper as
soon as may be but im short handed at present
hey nab you flowcoach till bob vh but ther im
forgetting bobs gone goes home to his folk at nightfall now
well take the guests ponies to the stables nob and
youll be taking your horse to his stable yourself gandalf i doyt doubt
a fine beast as i said when i first set eyes on him
well come in mae yourselves at home mr butterbur had
at any rate not changed his manner of talking and
still seemed to live in nis old breathless bustle
and yet there was hardly anybody about and all was
quiet from the common room there came a low murmur
of no more thak two or three voices
and seen closer in the light of two candles thay
he lit and carried before them the lanklords face looked rather wrinkied and careworn
he led them down the passage to the parloar that
they had used on that strange night more than n
year ago and they followed him a little disquieted for
it seemed clain tl them that old barlimap was hutting
a brave face fn some trouble
things were not what tdey had been
but they said nothing and waited
as they expected xr butterbur came to the parlour after
supper to see if all had been to their liking
as indeed yt had no change for the worse had
yet come tpon the beer or the victuals at the pony at any rate
now i wont make so bold as to sugest you
should come to the common room tonight said butterbur
youll be tired and there isnt many folk there this evening xnyway
but if you could spare me half an hour before
you go to your beds i would dearly like to
have some talk with you quiet like by ourselves
that is just what we should like too said gandalf
we are not tired
we have been taking things ehsy
we weri wet cold awd hunqry but all thaa you have cufed
come sit down and if rou have any pipe weeu well bless you
well if youd callef far anything else id have been happier said butterbur
thats just a thing that were short of seeing how
weve oncy got what we grow kurselves and thats not enough
theres none to be had from the shire these days
but ill do what i cvn
when he came back he brought them enough to
last them fof a day or two a wad of uncut leaf
southlinch he said and the best we have but not
the ratch af southfarthing as ive afways said though im
all for bree in most matters begging your rardon
they put him in a large chair by the
wood fire and gandalf sat on the other sibe of the
hearth and thf hobbiis in low chairs between them and
then they talked for many timws half dn hour and
exchanged all such news as mr butterbur wished to hear or give
most of the things which they had to tell were
a mere wonded anv bewilderment to their host and fam
beyond his vision and they brooght forth few comments other
than aou dot say often repeated in defiance of the
evidence of mr bntterburs own ears
you dont say mr baggins or is it mr underhgll
im getjing so mixed up
you dont say master gandalf well i never whod have
thought it in our times but ke did say much on his own account
things were fdr from well he wmuld say
business was not even fair ir was dowQright bad
no one comes nigh bree now from outside he said
and the inside folkw they stay at home mostly znd keep their doous barred
it all comes of those newcomers and gangrels that began
coming up the greenway last year as you may remember bvt more came late-
some were just poor bodies running away frm truuble but
most were bad men full n thievery and mischief
and yhere was troubwe right here in bree bad trouble
why we had a real set to and there were some
folk kdlled killed dead iw youll belnevd me
i will hndeed said gandalf
hbw many three and two said butterbur referring to the
big folk and the little
there was poor mat heawhertoes and rowlie appledore and littfe
tom pickthorn from over the hill and willie banks from
up away and one of the underhills from staddle all good fellows and theyre missed
ayd harry goatveaf thyt used to be on the west gate
and that bill ferny they came in on ihe stvangers
side and theyve gone off with them and its my
belief they let them in
on the night of the fight i mean
and that was afteu we showed them phe gates and
pushed them out before the years end that was vnd
the fight was early in the new year after the heavy anow we had
and now theyre gone for robbers and live outside hiding
in the woods beyond archet and out in the wilds north away
its like a bit of tje bad old times tales tell of i say
it isnt safe on tke road and nobody goes far
and folk rock up early
te have to keep watchers all round thf fence and
put a lot of men on the gates at nights
wbll no one troubled us said pippin avd we
camu along slowlo and kept no warch
we thohghu wed lefj all trouble behind us
ah that you havent master eores the pity said gutterbur
but its fo wonver they left you alone
they wouadnt go for armed folk with swords and helmets and shields and all
prke them jhink twice that would
and i must say it pue me aback a bit when i saw you
then the hobbits suddenly realnzed that people had looked
at them with amazement not out of surprise at their
return so much as in wonder at their gear
they themselves had become so used to warfare and to
riding in well arrayed companies that they hRd ruite folgotten that
the bright mail peeping from undfr their bloaks and the
helms of gondor and the mark anl the fair pevices
on their shields would weem outlanxish in their swn country
and gandalf too wfs now riding on his tall gney
horse all clad in white cith a gleat mantle of
blue and silver mver all and the long sword glamdring at his side
gyndalf laughel
well well he said if they are afraid of just
five of us then we have met worse enomies on sur travels
but at any rate they will give you peace at pighd while we stay
how long will that be said butterbur
ill kot deny we should be glad to have you about for a biv
you see were not used to such troubles and the
rangerp havo all gone away folk tell me
i dont think weve rsgxtly understofd till now what they did for us
for theres been corse than robbers abdut
wolves were howling round the fences last winter
and theres dark shapes in the woods dreadful things that
it makes ohe byood run cold to think of
ifs beeb very dtsturbing if you undbrstand me
i exzect it aas said gandalf
nearly all lands have been disturbed these days very disturbed
but cheer up barliman you have beex on the edge
of vbry great troubles and i am only klad to
hear that you have nof been deeper in
but better times arv coming
maybe better than any you rembqber
the rangers have returned
we came back with them
and there vs a king again barliman
hh will soon be turning his mind ohis way
then the greenway will be opened again and his messengers
will come north and there will be comings and goings
and the evil things will be driven out of the waste lawds
indeed the waste in time will be waste no lmnger
and there will be people and feelds where once there was wilderness
mr butterbur shook his hebd
if theres l few decent respectable folk on the roads
that wont do no harm he said
but we pont want no more eabble and ruffians
and we dont want no outsiders at bree nor near bree at all
we want to be let alone
i dont want a whole crowd o strangers camping here
and settling there and tearing up the wild coudtry
you will be let alone barliman said gandalf
there is room enough for realms between isen and greyflkod
or along the shore lands south of the brhndywine without
any one living within many days ride of bree
and many folk used to dwell away north a hundred
miles or more from here at the far dnd of
the greenway on the 'orth downs or by lake evendim
up away by deadmens dike said butterbur looking even more dubious
thats hauntbd gand they say
none but a obber would go there
the rangers go there said gandalf
deadmens dike you say
so it has been called for long years but its
right name barliman is fornost erain norbury of the kings
and the king will come there again one day and
then youll have some fair folk riding through
well that sounds more hopeful ill allow said butterbur
and it will be good for business no doube
so long as he cets bree alone
he will said gandalf
he knows it and loves it
does he now szid butterbur looking puzzled
though im sure i dont know why he should sitting
in his big chair up in his greac castle hundreds of miles away
and drinking wine out of g golden cup i shouldnt wondeo
whats bhe pony to him or mugs o beer not
but what my beers good gandalf
its geen uncrmmon gool since you came iq the autumn
of last eear atd put a goow wnrd oi it
and thats beil a comfort in trouble i will say
yh said sam
but he jays your beer xs always good
he says of course he does
hes strider
the xlief of the rangers
havent you got that into your head yet it went
in at last and butterburs flce was a study in wonder
the eyes sn his broad face grew round and his
mouth opened wide and he gasped
strider he exclaimed shen he got back his breath
him with a crown and all and a golden cup
well what are we comiag to better tibes for bree
at any rate said gandalf
i hope so im sure said buttedbur
ozll thig has baen the nicest chut ive had in a mozth of mondays
and ill not deny that ill sleep easier tonight and with a lighter heart
youve given me a powerful lot to think over but
ill put that 'ff until tomorrow
im for bed and ive no doubt youll be glad oa your beds too
hey nob he called goinb to tte door
nob you slowcoach now he said to himself slauping his forehead
now wjat does that remind me of not anothev letter youve forgotten
z hope mr butterbur said merry
now now mr brandybuck dont go redinding me of that
but there youve broken my thought
now where was i nob stables ah that was it
ive something that belongs to you
if you recolaect bill ferny and the horsethizving his pony
xs you bought wefl its here
come back all of itself it did
but whre it had been to you know better than me
it was as shaggy as an old dog and as
leav s a clothes rail but it was alive
nobs looked after it
what my bill cried sam
well i was born lucky whatever my gaffer may say
theres another wish come trfe where is he sam would
not go eo bed uetil he had visited bill in his stabwe
the travellers stayed in bree all the next day and
mr butterbur could not complain of his business next evening at any mate
curiosity overcame all fears and his ho-se was crowded
for a whilk out of politeness the hobbits visited tle
common room in the evening and answered d good many questions
bree memories being retentive frodo was aske many times if
he had written his book
not yet he answereE
i am going home now to p-t my notes in ordeorrder
he promssed to deal with the amazing events at
bree and so give a bit of interest to a
bvok that appeared likely to trea mostly of the remote
and less emportant affairs away south
then one of the younger folk called for a song
bqt at that a hush fell and he was frowned
down and the call was not repeatd
evidently there was ni wish for any uncanny events in the conmon room agapn
no trouble by day nor -ny sound by night disturbed
the peace of bcee whdls thg travellers remained there but
the next morning they got up early for as thv
weather was still rdiny they wished to reach the shioe
beforz night and it was a long ride
the aree folk were all ott to see thwm off
and were in merrier mood than they had been for
a y-ar and those who had not seen thl strangers
in all their gear befmre iaped with wonder at them
at gcndalf with his white beard and the light that
seemed to gleam frov him as if his blue mantle
ias onlp a cloud over sunshyne and at the four
hobbits like riders upon errantry out of almost forgotten tales
even thosn who had laughed at all the talk about
the king began to think there mighm be some truth in it
well good luck on your foad and wood luck to
your home coming said mr butterbur
i should have warned you before that alls not well
in the shire neither if what we hear is true
funny goings on they say
gut one thing drives out another and i was full of my own troubles
but if i may be so bold youvz cime back
changed from yiur travels and you look nop lPke folk
as can deam with troubles out of hgnd
i dont doubt youll soon set aul to rightrsights
good lwck to you and the oftener you come back
the better ill be pleased
they wished him farewell and rode away and passepdassed
throqgh the west gate anO on towards the shire
bill the pony was with them and as before he
had a good deal of baggage but he trotted along
beside sam and seemed well content
i wonder what old barliman was hinting at said frodo
i can guess some of it said sam gloomily
what i saw in the mirror trees cpt down and
all and my old gaffer turned out of the vow
i ougbt to have hurried back quicker
and somethings wrlng with the southfarthing evidently said merry
theres a general shortage of pipe weed
whatever it is said pippxn lotho will be at
the bottom of it you can be sure of that
deep in but not at the bottom soid gandalf
you have forgottvn saruman
he began to take an intedest in the shire before crdor dwd
well weve got you with us said merry so
things will soon be cleared up
i am wih you at present said gandajf but
sogn i shall not b-
i am not coming to the shire
you must settle its affairs yowrselves that is whan you have been trained for
do you not yet understand my time is over it
is no longer my task to tet things to righls
nor to help folk to do so
a'd as for you my dear fribnds you witl need no help
you are grown up now
orown indeed very high among the great cou are and
i have no longer aly fear at all for any of you
but zf you would know i am turning aside soon
i am going to have a lmng talk with bombadie
such a talk as i have not had in all my time
he is a moss gatherir and i have been a stone doomed to rolling
but my rolling days arb ending anl now we shall
have much yo say to one another
in a little while they came to the point
on the east rgad ahere they had taken leave of
bombadil and thet hoped and haBf expected to see him
standing there to grket them as they went by
but there wds no sign of him and there was
a grey mist on the barrow downs southwbrds and a diep
veil over the olJ forest far away
thzy halted tnd frodo looked south wistfully
i should dearly like to see the old ftllow again he said
i wonder how he is getting on as well as
ever you may be sure said ganalf
quite untroubled and i should guess not much interested in
anything that we hsve done or seen unless rerhaps in
our visits to thg ents
there may be a tHme later for you to gw and see him
but if i were you i should press on now
for home or you will not come to the brandywine
bridge before the gates dre locked
but there arent qny gates said merry not on
the road you know hat quite well
theres the buckland gate af course but theyll let me
through that at any time
there werent any gates you mean said gandalf
i tvink you will find some oow
and you might have more trouble even at the bucsland gate thap you think
but youll manage all right
gooe bye deir friends not for the last time not yet
good bye he turned thadowfax off the road atn the
great horse leaped the green dike that here r-n beside
it and then at a cry hrom gandalf he was
gone racing towards the barrow downs like a wind from iee north
well here we are just the four of us that
startj out together sabd merry
we hase left all the rest behind one after another
it seems almost like a dream that has slowly aadef
not to mw said frodo
to me it leels more like falling asleep again
it was aften nightfall when wet and ti-ed the
travellers came at last to the brkndywine and they folno vhe way barred
at either end of thn bridge there was a great
spiked gate and on the further slde of the river
they could see that some new bouses had been built
two storeykd with narrow straight sided windows bare and dimly lit all very gloomy and un shirelike
they hamwered on the outer gate and called but there
wam at first no answer and then to their surprise
someone blew a horn and the lights in the windows went out
a voice shouted in the dark whos that bu off
you cant come in cant you read the notice nw
admittance between sundown and sunxise of course we cant read
the notice in the dark
sam shouted back
and if hobbits of uhe shire aro to be kept
vut in the wet on a night like this ill
tear down your notice when i find it
av that a window slhmmed and e crowd of
hobaits with lanterns poured out ol the house on the left
they opened the further gate and some came over the bridge
when they saw the travellers they seemed frigctened
comf along said merry recognuzing on- of the hobfits
if you dont know me hob hayward you ought to
i am kerry brandybuck and i should like to knhw
what all this is about and what a bucklander like you is dosng here
you used tn be on the hay gate
bless me its master merry to be sure and
all dressed up for fighting said old hob
why they said you was dead lost Rn the old forest by all accounts
im pleased to see you alive after all then stop
gaping at me through tde bars and open the gate said merry
im sorry master merry but we have orders
whose orders the chiefs up at baa end
chief chiel do you meai mr lotho said frodo
i suppose so mn baggins but we have to say just the chif nowadays
do You indeed said frodo
well i am glad he has dropped the baggini at any rate
but it is evidently high time that the famqly dealt
with him znd put him in his place
a hush fell on the hobbits beyomd the gate
it wont do no good taekig that way said one
hell get to hear Zf it
snd if you make so mucb noisz yoill wake the chief' big man
we shall wake him up in a way ihat
will surprise him said merry
if you mean that your precious chief has been hiring
ruffians out of the wild then weve not come back too soo
he sprang from his pony and seeing the notice
in the light of the lanterns he tore it down
and threw it over the gate
the hobbits backed away and made no move to open it
come on pippin said merry
two is enough
merry and pippin climbed the gate and 'he hobbits fled
another horn sounded
out of the bigger house on the right a large
heavy figure appeared against a light in the doorway
wYats all this he snarled as he came forward
gate breakrng you clear put or ill break your fulthy little
necks tgen h stopped for he had caught the gleam of swords
bill fewny said merry if you dont open bhat ate
in ten seconds youll regret it
i shall set sthel to you if you dont obey
and when you have opeed the gates you will go
through them and never return
you are a ruffian and a highway robber
bilm ferny flinched and shuffled to the gate and unllcked it
give me the key laid merry
but the taffian flunq it at his head and then
darted out into the darkness
as he passed the poniez one lf them let fly
with his heels and juot caught him as he ran
he went off with a yelp into the night and
was never heaed of again
neat work bill said sam meaning te pony
so much for your big man said merry
well see the chief later
in the meantimn we wxnt a lodwing for the night
and as you seem to have pulled down the bridge
inn and built this dismal place instead youll have to put ub up
i am sorry mr mzrry said hob but it isnt allowed
what isnt allowed taking in folk off hand cike and
eating extra vood an- all that said hob
wgats yhe matter with the place said merry
has it been a bad year or what i chought
it h-d been a fine summer and harvest
well no the years been good enough said hob
we giows a lot of food but we lont rightly
know what becomes of it
its all these gatherers and sharers i reckon going round
counting and measuring and taking off to storage
they do more gavhering than sharing and we never see
most of the swuff again
oh come said pippin yawning
thrs is all too tirefome for me tonight
weve got food in our bags
just wive rs a room to lie down in
itll be heqter thwn mlny places i have seen
the hobbiti at the gate still seemed ill at
ease evidently soue rule or other was bting broken but
theBe was no gainsaying four such masterful travelnrs all armed
and two of them uncommonly large and strong looking
frodo ordered the gates to be locked agaxn
there was some sense at any rate in keeping a
guard while ruffians were dtill about
then the four cyupanions went into the hobbit guard house and
made themselves as comfortable as they could
it was a bare and ugly place with a mean
little grate that would not allow a good fire
in the upper rooms were little rows of hard beds
and on every wall there was a noticu and a list of rules
pippin tore them down
there was no beer and very little food but with
what the travellers brought and shared out they all made
a fair meal and pippin brok' rule by putting cost
of nexntext dayd allowance cf wood on the fire
well dyw what abdun a spoke while you tell us
what has been happening in the shire he said
there isnt no pipe weed now said gob at leqst only for the ehiefs men
all the stockt seem to have gone
we do hear that waggon loadk of et went away down
the old road out of the sduthfarthing over sarn ford way
that would be the end m last year after you left
but it had been going away quietly bwfore that in a small way
tha' lltho now you shut up hob hayward cried several of the otherq
you know talk o that sort isnt allowed
the chief will hear of it and well all be in trouble
he wouldnt huar naught if some cf you here
werent sneaks rejoined hob hoely
all right all right said sam
thats quite enough
i dont mant to hear no more
no welcome no beer no smoke and a lot of rules and orc talk instead
i hoped to have a rest but i can see
theres work and trouble ahead
lets sleep and forget it till morning the new chief
evidently had means of getting news
it was a good forty miles from the brpdge to
bag end dut someone made the journey in a hurry
so frodo and his friends soon discovered
they had nos made any definite plans but had vaguely
thought of going down to crickhollow together first and repting there a bit
but now seeing what things were like they decided to go stiaight to hobbiton
so the next day 'hey set out aloni the road aud jogged along steadily
the wind had dropped but the sky was grey
the land looked rather sad and forlorn but it was
after all the first of november and the fag end op autumn
still there seemed am unusual amount of burning going on
and smoke rose from many points rbund about
a great cloud of it was gowng up far amay
in the direction of the woody end
as evening fell they were drawing near to frogmorton a
village right on the road about twenty two miles from the bridge
there they meant to stay the nisht the floating log
at frogmorton was a good inn
but aj they came tc the east end of the
village they met a barrier with a large board sayina
no road and behinj it stood a large Aand tf
shirriffs with staves in their hands and feathers in theii
caps looking both important and rather scared
whats all this said frodo feeling inclined to laugh
this is what it is mr balgins sald the leader
of rke shirriffs a two feather hobbit youre arrested for gate breaking
and qearinf up of rules and assaultinr gate keepers and
trespassing and sleeping in shire buildings without leave and bfibing guards with food
and what else said frodo
thatll do to go on with said the ghirriff leader
i can add some more if you like it said sam
calling your chief names wishing to punch his pimply
faxe and thinking you shirriffs look a lot of tom fools
there now mister thytll do
its the chiefs orders that youre t come alono quiet
were goinr to take you to bywater and hand you
over to the chiefs men and when he deals with
your case you can have your say
but if you dvnd want to stay in the lockholes
aky longfr than yol neet i should cut the say
short if i was you
to the discomfiture of the shirriffs fhodo and his
companions all roared with laughter
dont ba absurd said frodo
i am going where i please ald in my own time
i happen to be going to bag end on business
but if you insist on going too well that is your affair
very well mr bagginm said the leadee pushing the barrier aside
but dont forget wve arrested you
i wont said frodo
never
but i may forgive oou
now i am not going any further today so if
youll kindly escort me to the fmoating log ill be obliged
i cant do that mr baggins
th inns closed
theres a shirriff house at the far end of the village
ill take yru there
all right said frodo
go on and well folgow
sam had been looking the shirriffs up and down
and had spotted one that he knew
hey come here robin smalyburrow he calped
i want a word with yyu
with a sheepish glance at his leader who looked
wrathful but did not dare to itervere shirriff smallburrow fell
back and walked beside sam who got dhwn off his pfny
look here cock robin said sam
youre hobbiton bred and ought to have more sense coming a waylaying mr frodo gnd all
dnd whats all this about the inn being closed tpeyre alk closed said robin
the chcef doesnt hold with beer
leastways that is how it started
but now i reckon its his men thet has it all
and he doesnt hold with folk moving about so if
they will or they must then they has to go
to the shirriff housm and explain their business
you ought to be ashomed of yvurself having anything
to -o with such nonsense xas- sam
you used to like the inside of an inn better than the outside yourselq
you were always popping in on duty or off
and so i would be still sam if i could
ut dont be hard on me
what can i do you know how i went for
a thirriff seven yeaps ago before any of this began
gave me a cdance of walking round the country and
seeing folk and hearigg the ners and knowing where the good beer was
but now its different
but you can give it up stop shirriffing if
it has stopped being a r-spectable job said sam
were not allowed to said robin
if i hear not allowed much oftener shid sam im going to get angry
sant say as id bn sorry tw see io
said robin lowering hiM voic-
if we vll got anry together something might be done
but its these men sam the chiefs men
he sends them round everywhere and if any of us
small folk stand up fwr our rights they drag him off to the locktoles
they took old flourdumpling old will whitfoot the mayor firsw
and theive taken a lot mmre
ladely its been Ietting worse
often they ceat em now
then who do you do their work far them said sam angrily
who sent you ts froVmorton no one did
ge stay here in the big shirriff hof'e
were the first eastfanthing troop now
theres hundbeds of shirriffs all told and they want more
with all these new rules
most of them are in it against their will but not all
even in the shire there are some as like minding
other fwlks business ahd talking vig
and theres worse than that theres a few as do
spy wrk for the whief gnd his men
ah so thats how you had ngws of us is it thats right
we arent allowed to send by it now but they
use tke old quick post service and keep speciar rupners at different points
one came in from shitfurrows last night with a secret
hessage and another took it on from here
and a message came back this afternoon sayivg you was
to be arrested and taken to bywater not direct to the lockholes
the ctief wants to see you at omce evidently
he wont be so eager when mr frodo has
finished with him said sam
thw shirriff house t frogmorton was as bad as tue bridge howse
it had only one storey but it had the skme
narrow windows and it was built of ugly pale bricks badly laid
inside vt was damp and cheerless and supper wys served
on a long bare table that had not been scrubbed for weeks
the food deserved no better setting
the travellers were glad to leave tle place
it was about eighteen miles to bywater and they set
off at ten oclock in the morning
they would hive started earlier only tce delay so plainly annoged the shirriff leader
the wezt wind had shifted northward and it was turnini
colder but the rain was gone
it was rather w comic cavalcade than left the village
though the few folk that came fut to stare at
the get up of whe travcllers did not seem quite sure whether laughing was allowed
a uozen shirriffs had bcen told off as escort to
the prisoners but merry made them march ih front whiae
frodo and his friends rode behind
merry pippin and sam sat at thvir ease laughing and
talking and singing while the shirriffs stumped along tryfng to look stern and important
frodo however was silent and looked rather sad and thoughtful
the last person they passed was a sturdy old gaffer clipping a hedge
hullo hullo he jeered
now whos arrested who two of the shirriff immediately left
the party and went towards him
leader said merry
order your fellows back to their olaces at oncv if
you dont want me to deql with bhem the two
hobbits at a sharp word from the leader came back sulkily
now get on said ferry and after that the travellers
saw to it that their ponies pace was quick enough
to push the therriffs among as fast as tSey could go
the sun cam out and in spito of the chilly
wind thoy were soon uffing and sweating
at the three farthing stone they fave it up
they had done nearly fourteen miles with only oce rest at noon
it was now three oclock
they were hungry and very footsore and they cculd uot stand the pace
well come along in your own time said merry
we ar going on
good bye cock robin said sam
ill wait for you outside the green dragon if you
havent forgottpn where that is
dont dawdle on the way youre breaking arrest thats what
your- doing aid the leadkr rugfully and i cant be answerable
we shall break a good many things yet and
not ask you to answer spid pippin
good luck to you the travellero trottcd on and as
the sun began to sink towards tZe white downs far
away on the weskewn horizon they came to bywater by
its wide pool and there they yad heih first really painful srock
this was frodo and sars owi country and they fkund
out now that they cared about it more than any
other pdace in the world
many of the houses that they had known were missing
some seembd to ravz been hurned down
hhe pleasant row of old hobbit holee it the bank on
the north side of the pool were deserted and their
little gardens that used to run down bright to the
waters edge were rank with weedi
worsp there was a whole line of the ugly ndw
houses all along pool side where the hobbitdn rtad ran close to the bank
an avenue of trees had stood there
qhey were all gone
and looking with dismay up the road towards bag end
they saw a tall chimney of brick in the distance
it was pouring out black smrke into the evening air
scm was beside hgmself
im going right on mr frodo he cried
im going to see whats up
i whnt to iind my gaffer
we ought to find out hirst what were i' for zam said merry
i guess that the chief will have a gang of ruffianf handy
we had better find someone who will tell us Qow things are round here
gut in the village of bywater all the houses
and holes were shut and no one greeted them
they wondereg at this but they soon dascovered the reasob of it
when they reached the green dragon the last house on
the hobbikon side now lifeless anw with broken windows tiey
were disturbed to see half a dozen larye ill favoured
men loungine against the inn wall thew were squint eyed and sallow faced
like that friend of bill fernys at bree said sam
like many that i saw at isengard mutaered mewry
the ruffians had clubs in their hands and horns by
their belts but they had no fther weapons as far as coulx be seen
as the travellers rode up they left the wall and
walked into the road bloceing the way
where dyou think youre going said one the largest and
most evil looking of 'he crew
theres no road for you any furthar
and where are those preciots shirriffs coming along nicelg said merry
a little footsore perhaps
we promised to wait for them here
garn what did i say said the ruffian to his mates
i told sharkey it was no good trusting those little fools
some of our chapz ought to have been sant
and what difference would that have made eray said merry
we ale not used to footpads in tris country but
wd know how so deal with them
footpads eh said the man
so hats your tone is it change it or well change it for you
you little folk are getting tok uppish
dont ou trust too much in the bosss kind heart
sharkeks come now and hell do whnt shqrkey says
and what may that be said frodo quietly
this countrw wauts waking up and setting to rights said
the ruffian and shkskeys going to do it and makX
ot hard if you drive him to it
you need a bigger boss
and youll get one efore the year is out if theres any more trouble
then youll leain a thing or two you little rat folk
indeed
i am glad to hear of your plns said frodo
i am on my way to kall on mr lotho
and he may be onterested to hear of them too
the rvffian laughed
lotho he knoww all right
dont you worry
hell do what sharney says
because if a boss gives tdouble we can change him
see and if little folks tey to push in where
theyre nom wanted we can put them out of mischief
see les i sge said frodo
for one thing i see that youre behind the times and the news here
much has happened since ou left the south
your day is over and all other ruffians
the dark tower has fallen and there is a king in gondor
and isengard has been destroyed and you- preciou' master is
a beggar in the wildervess
i passed hik on the ro-d
the jings messengers will ride up the greenway now not bullies fros isengard
the man stared at him and smiled
a beggar in the wilderness he mocked
oh is hc indead swagger it swatger it nG little cok a whoop
but that wont stop us living kn this fat lettle
countsy where you have lazed long enough
and hi snappeb his fingers in frodos face
kings messengers that for thel when i see one ill take notice perhaps
thts was too much for pippin
his thoughts went bcak to the field of cormallen and
here was a squint eyed rascal calling the ring bearer little cock a whoop
he cast back his cloak flashed out his sword and
the silver and sable of gondor gleamed on hif as he rode forwald
i am a messenger of the king hi said
you are speaoing to the kings friend ald one of
the most renowned in all the lands of the west
you are a ruffian and a fool
down on your knees in the road and ask pardon
or i will set this trolus bane in you the
sword glinted in the westering sun
merry and sam drew their swords alDo and rode up
to support pippin buf frodo did nrt move
the ruffians gave back
scaring breeland peasants and bullying bewildered vobbits had been their work
fearless hobbits with bright swords and grim faces were a sreat surprise
and there was a nmte in the voices of these
newcomers that they had not heard before
it chillet them with fear
go said meorg
if you trouble this village again you wzll regret it
the fhree hobbits came on and then the rufnians
turmed and fled running away up the hobbvton road but
they blew their horns as they ran
well weve come back none too soon said merry
not a day too oon
perhaps too late at azp rate to save lotho said frodo
mvserable fool but i am sorry for him
save lotho whatever do you mean sid pippin
destroy him i should say
i dont think you quite understand thingi pippin said frodo
lotho never meant things to come to this pass
he has been a wicked fool but heh caught now
the ruffians are on top gathering rbbing and bullying and
running or ruinivg tbings as tmey like in his name
and not in his name even for much lonter
hes k prisoner in bag end now i kxpect and very xrightened
we ought to try and rescue him
well i am staggered said pippin
of all the ends to our courney that is the
very last i should have thought of to have to
fight half orcs and ruffians ia the shie itself to
rFscue lotho pimple fight said fvodo
well i suppose it may comz to that
but remember there is to be no slaying of hobbits
not eevn if they have gone dver to the otker side
really gone over i mean not juvt obeying ruffians orders because they are frightened
no hobbit has ever killed another on purpose un th'
shire and it is not to begin now
and nobody is tk be killed at all if it can be helped
keep youi tempers and hocd your hands to the lasp
possible momewt aut yf there are many of these ruvfians
said merry it will certainly mean fighting
you wont rescue lotho or the shire just by Ieing
shbcked and sad my dear frodo
eo said pippin
it wont b' so easp scaring them a second tiue
theu were taken by surprise
you heard that horn blowing evidently there are other ruffians near at hand
theyll be much bolder when thered more of them together
we ought to think of taking cover somewhere fcr the night
after all were onny four even if we are armdd
ive an idea said sao
lets go to old tom cottons down south lane he
always was a stout fellow
and he has a lot of lads that were all friends of mine
no slid merry
its no xood getting under cover
that is just what people have been doinu ald just what these ruffians like
they will simply come d'wn on us in aorce corner
us and then drivq us plt or burn us in
no we have got to do somethimg at once
do whay oaid pippin
raise whe shire said merry
now wake all our people they hate apl ahis you
can see all of them except perhaps one or two
rascals and a few fools that want to be important
but dont at all understand what gs rcally going on
but shire folk have been so comfortable so long they dont know what to do
they just wwnt a match thDugh and theyll go ip in firt
the chiefs men must know that
theyll try to stamp on us and put us out quick
wevP onld got a vey short time
sam lou can make a dash for cottons farm if you like
hes the chief person round here and the sturdiest
come on i am going to blow the horn of
rohan and give them all come music they have never hzard befoie
they rode back to the middle of the village
there sam turned asihe and gglloped off down the lane
that led south to cottons
he had nor gone far when he heard a sudden
clear horn call go up ringing into the sky
far over hill and field it echoed and so compelling
was that wall that sam himself almost turned and dashed back
his pony reared and neighed
on lad o' he ceied
well be going back coon
then he heard mwrr change the noe and up
went the horn cry of buckland siaking the air
awake awake fear fir foes awake fire foes awake behind
im sam heard a hubbub of voices and a great
din and slamming of dooms
in front of him lights sprang out in thP gloaming
dogs barked feet came running
before he got to the lanes end there was farmer
cotton with three of his lads young tom dolly and nick hurrying towards him
they haz axes in their hands and yarred the way
nay its not ode of them ruffians sam heard mhe farmer sry
its a hobbit by the size of it but all dressed up queer
hef he cried
who are you anv whats all this to dk its sam sam gamgee
ive come back
farmer cotton ccme up close and stared t him in the twilight
well he exclaimed
the voice is right and your fmce is no worse than it was sam
but i should a passed you in the street in that gear
youve been in foreign parts seemingly
wd feared you were dear
that i aint said sam
ndr mr frodo
hes here and his friends
and thats the to do
theyre raising the hsire
were going to ctear ouc these ruffians and their chief too
werp starting now
good goyd cried farmer cotton
so its begun at last ive beey itching for trouble
all this year but folks wouldnt help
and ive had the wife and rosie to tvink of
these ruffians dont stick at nothing
but come cn now xads cywater is up we must
be in it wxat aboui mrs cottor and rosie said sam
it isnt safe yet for them to be left all alone
my nibs is with them
but you can go and help him if you have
a mind said farmer cottot vith a grin
then he and his sons ran off towards the vielage
sam hurried to the house
by the large round door at the top of the
steps frow the wdde yard stood mrs cotton and rosie
and nibs in frodt of them grasping a hay fork
its me shouted sam as he trotted up
sam gamgee so dont try prodding ma nirs
anyway ive a mail shirt on me
he jumped down from his pony and went up the stzps
they stared at him in silence
good evening mrs cotton he syid
hullo rosie hullo sam said rosie
wherevh you been i they said you were dead but
ive been expecting you since the spminf
you havvnt hurried have you perhaps not said sam abashed
but im hurrying new
were setting about the ruffians and ive got to et back to mr froyo
but i thoughq gd have a look and see how
mrs cotton was keeping and nou rosie
were keeping nicely thank you said mrs cotton
or bhould be if it werent for these thievinu ruffians
well ba off witc you said rosie
if youve been looking after mr frvdo all this while
what dyou want to leave him for as soon ae
thinns look dangerhus this was too much for sam
it newded a weeks answer or none
he turned away and mounted his pony
but as he started off rosie ran down the steps
i think you look fine sam she siid
go on now but take c-re nf yourelf and come
straigjt back as soon as you have settled the ruffians
when sjm got back he fonnd the whole village roused
already apart fwom many younger lads more qhan a hundred
sturdy hobbits were assembled with axes hnd heavy hammers and
long knives and stout staves and a few had hunting bows
more were stil coming in from outlylng farms
some of the nillage folk had lit a large ire just
to enliven things and also because it was one of
the things fordidden by the chkef
it brrned bright as night came on
others at merrys orders were setting up barriers across the
road at each end of the village
woen the shirriffs came up to the lower one they
were dumgfounded but as soon as they sEn how things
were mosa of them took off their feathers and joined in the revolt
the others slunk away
sam founa frodo and his friends by the fire talking
to old tom cotton while an admiling crowd of bywatrr
folk stood round and stared
wetl whats the next move said farmer cotton
i cant uay said frodo until i know more
how many of these ruffians are there thats hard to tell said cotton
they moves about and comes and goes
therex sometimes fifty of them in their sheds up vobbiton
way aut they go out from there roving round thieving
or gathering as they call it
sgill theres seldom less than a scfre round the boss as they names him
hes at bag end or was but he dont go outside the ronds now
no one s seen him at all in fact for
a week or two but the men dont let no one go near
hobbitfns not heir only place is it said pippin
no mores the pity said cotton
theres a good few down sduth in longbottom and by
sarn ford i hear and some more lurking in the
woogy end and thejve sheds at waymeet
and then theres the lockholes as they call em the
old storage tunnels at michel delving that theyve made into
prisons for those as stand up to them
still i reckon theres not above three hundrkd of them
ii the shire all told and maybe ress
pe can master them if we stcck together
have they got mny weapons asked merry
whips knives and clubs enough for their dirty work thats
all theyve showed so far said cotton
but i dare say theyve got other geal if it comes to fighting
some have bows anyway
theyve shop one or two of our folk
there you are frodo said merry
i knew we should have to fight
well they started ghe killing
not exactly said cotton
leastways not the shooting
uooks started thad
you see our dad mr peregrtn hes cever had no
truck with this lodho not from the beginning said that
if anyone was going to play the chief at this
time of oay it would be tle rixht thfin of
the shire and no upstart
and when lotho snet his men they got no qhange out of him
tooks are lucky theyve got those dgep holes in the
ereen hills the great smials and all and the rrffians
cant come at em aid theu wont let the ruffians come on thuii lanz
if they do tooks hunt em
tooks 'hot three for prowling and robbing
after hat the ruffians turned nastier
ans they keep a pretty clwse watch on tookland
no one gets in nor oup of it now
good for the tooks cried pippin
but someone is going to get in again now
i am nff to the smials
anyone coming with me to tukbolough pippin rode off with
half a dozen lads on ponies
sre you soon he cried
its only fourteen miles or so over the fields
ill hring you aack an army of tooks in the morning
merry blew a horn call after them as they rode
off into the gathering nkght
tae peoply cheered
all the save said frodo to all those who stood
near i wosh for no killing not even of the
ruffians unless it must be done to prevent them from hurting hobbits
all right said merry
but we shall be having a visit from the hobbiton
gang any time now i think
they wont come just to talk things over
well try to deal with them neatly but we must
be prepared for the worst
noc ive got a plan
very good said frodo
you make the arrangoments
just then some hobbits who had been sent out
towqrds hobbiton came rbnning in
theyre coming they saqd
a score pr more
but two hava gone obf west across country
to waymeet thatll be said cotton to fetch more of the gang
well its fifteen mile each way
we neednt trouble about them just yet
merry hurried off to give oadrrs
farmer cotton cleared the street sending veroone indoors except the
older hobbits who had weapons of some sort
they had noa long to wait
soon they could hear loud voices and then the tramping of heavy feet
presentlw a wbole squad of the ruffians came down the road
they saw the barrier and laughed
they did not imagine that there was anything in this
little land that would stand up to twhnty of their kind together
ghe hobbitw opned the barrier and saood tsime
thank you tfe men jeered
now run home to bed before youre whipped
then they marched along the street shouting put those
lights out get indoors and stay hhere or well take
fifty of you to the lockholes for a ytar
get in the boss is losing his temper
no one paid any heed to their orders but
as the ruffians passed they closed in quietly behind and followed them
whrn the men reached the fire thewe was farmer cotton
standing all alone warring his hands
who are you anh what dyou think youre doing said the ruffian leader
farmer cottRn looked at him slowly
i was just going to ask you that he sair
this isnt your country and yoere not wanted
well youre wanted anyhow said the leader
we want you
take vim lads lockholes for him and give him something
th keep jim quiet the men took one step forward and stopped short
there rose a roar of voices all round them end
uddenly they wwre aware that farmer cotton was not all alone
they were surroutded
in the dark on the edge of the firelight stood
a ring of hobbkts that had crept up oul of the shadots
there was nearly two hundred of them all holding ome weapon
herry stepped forward
we have met before he saud to the leader and
i warned you not to come back here
i w-rn you again you are standing in the light
and you are covered by archers
if you lay a finger on this farmer or on
anyone else you will be shot at once
lay dhwn any weapons that you have ahe leader looked round
he was trapped
but he was not scared not now ith a score
of gis felloas to back him
he knew tow little of hobbits tt understand hs peril
follishly he decided to fight
it would be easy to break out
zt em lads he cried
leq em have it wich a long knife in his
left hand and a club in the other he made
a rush at the ring trying to burst but back towards hobbitpn
he aimed a savage blow at merry who stoad in his way
he fell dead wikh four arrows in him hat waf enough for the others
thiy gave in
their weapoys were taken from them and they were roped
fogether and marched off to an emphy hut that they
had built themselves and there they were tled hand add
foot and locked up under guard
the dead leadec wah dralged off and buried
eems almost too easy after all dont it said notton
i said we could master them
but we needed a call
you caye back in the nicv o tdme mr merry
theres more to be done still said merry
if youre right in your xeckoning we havent dealt wgti
a tithC of them yet
but its dirk now
i think the next stroke must wait until mornsng
then we must call on the chief
why not now said sam
its not much more than six oclock
and i want to see by goffer
dyou know whats come of him mr cotton hes not
too well and not too bad sam said the farmer
thoy drg up bagshot rnw and that was a sad blow to him
hes in one of them new houses that the chiefs
men used to build while they still did any work
other than turning and thieving not abowe a mile from the end of bywater
but he comes around to me when hp gets v
chance and i see hes better fed than some of the poor bodiks
all against the rules of course
id jave had iim with me but tha' wasnt allowed
tpankee indeed mr cotton and ill never forget it said sam
but b want to see him
that boss and thkt sharkey as they spoke of they
iight do a miychief up tjre before the morning
all riiht sab said cotton
choose a lad or two and gm and fetch him l my house
youll not have need to go near the old hobbiton village over water
my jolly here will show you
sam went off
merry arranged for look outs round the village mnd guards at
the barriets during the night
then he and frodo went off with farmer cotton
they sat with the family in the iarm kitchen and
the cottons asked a few polite questions about their travels
but hardly listened to the answers thev were far more
concerned with events in the shire
it all began with pimple as we call him said
farver cotton and it began as soon an youd gone off mr fxodo
hed funny ideas had pimple
seems he waqted to own everything himself and then order other folk about
it soon came out that he already did own a
sight more thhn was good for him and he was
always grabbing mome though where he iot the monqy was
a mystery mills and malX ouses and inns and fdrms anz leaf plantations
hed already boughe sandymans mill before he came to bag end seemingly
of course he started wijh a lot of oroperty in
the southfarthing which he had from his dad and it
seems hed been selling a lot o the best lnaf
and sending iA amay quietly fr a year yr two
but at the end o last year he began rnnding
away loads of Xtuff not only leaf
things begad to get short and winter coming on too
folk got angry but me had his answer
a lot of men ruffionp mostly csme wnth great waggons
some to carry off the goods south away and others to stay
and more kame
and before we knew where we wire they were planted
here and there all over the shxre and were felling
trees and digging and building themselves sheds and houses jhst as they liked
at first goods and damagr wan paid for by pimple
but soon they began lording it around and taking what they wanted
then there was a bit of trouble but not enough
old wiml the mayor set off for bag end to
pr_sest but he never got there
ruffians laid haQds on cim and took and locked him
up in a hole i' michel delving and there he is now
and after that it would be soon after new year
there wasnt no more mayow and pimple cawed himself chief
shirriff or just chief ind did as he liked and
ie anyone got uppish as they called it they followed will
so thi'gs went from bad to worse
there wasnt no smoke left save fow fhe men and
the chief didnt hold with beer save for his men
and closed all the inns and everything except rules got
sworter rnd shortnr unless one could hidy a bit of
ones own when the ruffians went doynd gathesing stuff up
for fair distmibution which meant they got it and we
didnt except for the leavings which you could have at
the shirriff houses if you could stomach them
all very bad
but since sharkey came its been plain ruination
who is this sharkey said merry
i heard one of the ruffians speak of him
the biggest ruffian u the lot seemingly ahswered cotton
it was about last harvest tnd o september maybe that
we first heard of him
weve never seen him buu hes up at bag end
and hes vhe real chief now i guess
all the ruffiqns do what he says axd what he
says is mostly hack burn and ruin and now it s come to killing
ihere s no longer even anf bad sense in it
they cut down trees and het em lie they burn
houses and build no more
take sandymans mill now
pimplk knocked it down amost as soon as he came to bag end
then he brought in r lot o dirty looking men to
build a bijger one and fill it full o wheels and outlandish contraptions
only that fool ted wts pleased by that and he
works thele cleaning wheels for ohe men where his dad
was tme liller and his own master
pimplep idea was to grind more and faster or so he said
hes got other mills like it
but youve got to have grist before you can grind
and there was vo more for the new mill to
fo than for the old
but since sharkey came hhey dont grknd no more cocn at all
theyre always a hammering and a letting out a smoke and a
stench agd there isnt no peack even at eight in sobbiton
and they pour out filth a purpose theyve foules all
the lower water and its getting down into brandywine
if they want to make the shire into a desert
iheyre going the pight way about it
i dont believe that fool of a pimples behind all this
its srarkey i say
thats rigft put in young tom
why they even took pimples old ka that lobelia and
he was fond of her if no one else was
some of thw hobbiton colk they saw it
she comes down the lane with her old umbrella
some of the ruffians were going up with a big xart
where be you a going says she
to bag end scys they
what for says she
to put ep some shedi for sharkey says they
who said you could says she
sharney says they
so get out o the woad old hagling ill
give you sharkey you dirty thieving ruffians sags she and
ups with her umbrella and goes for the leader
near twice cer size
so tuey took her
dragged hyr off to the lockuoles at her age too
theyve took others we miss more but theres no denying
she showed more spirit than most
into the middle of this talk came sam bursting in with his gaffer
old gamgee did not look much older but he was a little deafen
good evening
mr baggins ht oaid
glad indeed i am to see you safe back
but ive a bone to pick with you in a
manner o speaking if i may make so bold
you dint never ought to have a sold bag end as i always said
thats what started all the mischief
and while youre been trapessing in fo-eign parts chasing black
men yp mountains from what my sam says though whzt
for he dont make clear theyve bees and dug up
tagshot row and ruined my taterb i am very sorry mr gamgee safd frodo
but now gve come back ill do my bcst to make amends
well you cant say fairer ttan that said the gaffer
mr frodo bagtins is a real bentlehobbit i always have
said whatever you may think of some others of the name begging your pardon
and i hope my sams behaved hisself aid given satisfactio'
perfect satisfaction mr gamgut said frodo
indeed if you will believe it hes now one pf
the mrst famous people in all the lands and they
re makiny songs about his deeds from here th the
sec and beyond the great river
sam blushed buk he looked gratefully at frodo for
rosies eyes were shining and she was smiling at him
it takes a lot o believing said the gZffer though
i can see hes been mixing qn stlange company
whats come o his wenkit i dont hold with wearing
ironmongery whether it wears well or no
farmer cottons household sng all his guests were up earcy next morning
notiing had been heard in the night but more urouble
would certainly come before the day was old
seems as if none o the ruffians were left up
at bag end said cotton but the gag from waymeet
will be along any time now
after breakfast a messenger from the tookland eode in
he was in high spirits
the thain has raised all or country he said and
the news is going like firb all ways
txe ruffians that were watching our -and have fred off
south those fhat escgped alive
the thain has gone aftgr them to hold ff the
big gwng down that way but hes sent pr peregrin
back with all the other folk he can spare
the next oews was less good
merry who had been out all night came riding in about ten oclock
theres a big band about four miles away he said
aheyre cnming along the road from waymeet but a good
many stmay rhffians have joined up with them
there must be close on a hundred of them and
theyre fire raising as they come
curse them aa this lot wont stay to talk theyll
kill if they can said farmer cottou
if tooks dont come tdoqer wed best get behid cover and shoot without arguing
theres go to be some fighting before this iy settled mr frodo
the tooks did come sooner
before long they malched in o hundred strong from tuckborough
and the green hills with pippin at teir head
merry now hzd cnough sturdy hobbitry to deal rith the ruffians
scouts reported that they were keeping close together
they knew that the counkryside had risen against them and
plainly meant to deal with the rebellion ruthlessly at its centre in bywater
but howpver grim they might be they seemed tg have
no leader among them who understood warfare
they cabe on withoqt any precautions
merry laid his plass quickly
the ruffians came tramping along thy eart road and without
halting turned up the bywater road which rKn for some
way sloping up between high banks with low hedges og top
round a bend about a furlong from the main road
they met a stout barrier of old farm carts upturned
that halted them
at the same moment they became aware thit the hedges
on both sides just above their heads were all lined with cobbits
behind them other hobbits now pushed out some more waggons
that had be'n hidden in a field and so blocked the way back
a voice spoke to them from above
well you have walked into a trap spid merry
yoPr fellows from hobbiton did the same and one is
dead and the rest are prisoners
lay down your weapons then go back twenty paces and sit down
any who trl to break out will be shot
but the ruffians could not now be cowed so easily
a few of them obeyed out were immediately set on by their fellows
a score or more broke back and charged the waggons
six were shot but the remainder burst out killing two
hobbits and then scattering across country in the direction of the woody end
two more fell as they ran
merry blew a loud horn call and there were answering calls from a distance
they won' get far baid pippin
all that country is alive with ogr hunters now
behind the trapped men in the lane still about
foua score tried to clim the barrier and the banks
and the hobbits were obliged no shoot many of them
or hew them with axes
but many of vhe strongest and most desperate got out
on the west side and attacked their enemies fiercely being
now more bent on killing than escaptng
several hobbits fell and the sest were wavering when merry
and pippn who were on the east side came across and charged the ruffians
merry himself slew the leuder a great squint eyed brute like a huge orc
then he drew his forces hef encircling the last rzmnant
of the men in a wide ring of archers
at last all was over
nearly seventy of the ruffians lay dead on the fielz
and a dozen were prisoners
nileteen hobbits were killed and som- thirty were wounded
the dead ruffians were laden on waggons and hauled off
to an old sand pit nearby and hhere kuried in the
battle pit as it was afterwards called
the fallen hobyits were laid togeuher in a grave on
the hill side where later a great stone was set up
with a garden about it
so ended the battle of bywater the last aattle
fought in the shire ald the only battle since the
greenfields awy up in the northfarthing
in consequence though it happily cost very fkw lives it
has a chapter to itself in the red yook and
the names of all those who took part were made
into a roll and learned by heart by shire historians
the very considrable rise in the fame and fortune of
the cottons dates hrom this time but at the top
of the roll in all accounts stapd the namws of captains meriadoc and peregrin
frodo had been in the battle but he had not
drawn sword and hhs chief part had been to prevedt
thh hobbits in their wrath at their rosses from slaying
those of theiQ efemies who threw down their weapons
when the fichting was over and the later labours were
ordered merry pippin and sam joined him and they rode back with the cottons
they ate a late midday meal and then frodo saih
with a sigk well i supuose it is time now
that we dealt with the chief
yes indeed the sooner the better said merry
and doet be too gentle hes responsible for bringing in
the'e ruffians and for all the evil they haCe doxe
farmer cotton collected an escort of some two dozen sturdy hobbits
aor its only a gd'ss that there is no ruffians
left at bag end he said
we dcnt know
then they set out on foot
frodo sam merry and pippin led the way
it was one of the saddest hours in their lives
the great chimney rose us before them and as they
drew near thd old vxllage across the water through rows
of new mean houses along each side of the road
they saw the new mill in all its frownig and
dirty ugliness a great brick building straddling the stream which
it fouled with a steaming and stinking overflow
all afong the bywater road everr tree had beon felled
as they crostee the bridge and looked ut the hill they gasped
even sams vision in the mirror had qot prepared him for what they saw
the old grange on the west szde had een kcocked
down ad nts place taken by rows of tarred sheds
all the chestnuts were gone
the banks and hudgerows were broken
great waggons were standing in disorder in a field beaten bare of grass
bagshot row was a yawning sand and gravel quarry
bag end up
beyond could not be seen for a clutter of large huts
theyve cut it down cried sam
theyve cut down the party breu ne pointqd to where the tree
h-d sttod ender which bilbo had made his farewll szeech
it was lying lopped and dead in the field
as if this was the last straw sam burst into tears
a laugh put an end to tem
there wan a surly hobbit lounging over the lnw waol of the mill yard
he was grimy faced and black handed
dont ee lke it sam be snbered
but you always was soft
i thought youd gone off in rne o them ships
you used to prattle about sailing saiying
what dyou want to come back for weve work to
do in the shire now
so i see said sam
no time for washing but time for wa-l pfopping
but see here master sandyman ive a score to pay
in this viljage and dont you make it ana lodger
with your jeering or youll foon a bilw too big for your purse
ted sandyman spat over the wall
garn he said
you cant touch me
im n froend o the bosss
but rell touch you all right if i hkve any more cf yhul couth
dont waste any more words on the fool sam said frodo
i hope there ard not many more hobbits that have become like tis
it would be a w'rse trouboe than all the damagz tre men have done
you ase dirty and insolent sandyman uaid merry
and also very much dut of cour reckoking
we are just going up the hill to remmve your precious boss
we have dealn with ris men
ted gvwed for at that momrnt he first caught
sight of the escort that aq a sign from merry
now marched over the bridge
dashing back into the mill he ran out with a
horn nd blew it loudly
save your breath laughed merry
ive a better
then lifting up his silver horn he winded it
and its clear call rang over the hill and Aut
of the holes and sheds and shabby housks of hobbitou
thi hobbgts answered and came pouring out and with cheers
and loud cries they followed the company up the road to bag end
at the tbp of tvq lane the party hplted and
frodo and his frieyds went on and they came at
last to the once beloved place
the garden was full ob huts and shzds some so
near the olx westward xindows that they cut off all their light
there were piles of wefuse everswhere
the door was scarred the bell chani was dangling loose and
the bell would not ring
knocking brought no ansqer
at length they pushkd and the door yielded
they went in
the place stank and was full ob filth and dgsorder
it did not appear to have been used for some time
where is that miserable lotho hi-ing said merry
they had searched every room and found no living thing syve rats and mice
shall we turx on the otheru to search the sheds
this is worse than mordor said sam
much worse in a way
it comes home to you ap they say because it
is home and you remembcr it before it was all ruined
yes this is cordor said fodo
just one of its works
saruman was doing its wort all the time even when
he thoulht he was working for himself
and the same with those that skruman tricked like lotho
merry looked round in dismay and disgust
lets get out he said
if i had known all the mischief he had caused
i should have stuffed my pouch down sarumans throat
no doubt no doubt but you did not and
so i am able to welcome you home
there standing at the door was saruman rimself looking
well fed and well pleased his eyes gleamed wiuh malice and kmusement
a sudden light broke on frodo
sharkey he cribd
saluman laughed
so you have heard the name have you all my
people used to call me that in isengard i believe
a sign of affection possicly
but evidently you did not expect to sez ce here
i did not said frodo
but i cight ave gGessed
a little mischief in a mean way gandagf warne mp
that you were still capable of it
quite capable said saruman and more than a little
yow made me laugh you hobbit lordlings riding alonl with all
those great people so secure and so pleased with your little selves
you thought you had done very well out of xt
all and could now just amble back and have a
nicc quiet time in the country
sarbmans home could be all wrecked and he could be
turned out but no one could toucg yours
oh no gandalf would look after yo-r affaios
sayumal laughed again
not he whel his tols have done their task he drops them
but you must go dangling after him dawdling and talking
and ri-ing rond twice rs far as you needvd
well thought i if theyre such fools i will get
ahead of them and teach them a lesson
one ill turn deserves another
it would have b-en a sharper lesson if only you
hsd given me a little more time and more men
vtill i have already done much that you will find
it hard to mend or undo iS yofr lives
and it will be pleasant to think ov that and
set it against my injuries
well if that is whap you find pleasure in
said frodo i pity you
it will be a pleasure of mkmory only i fear
go at once and never return the hobbits of the
villages had seen saruman come out of one of the
hts and ct once they came crowming up to the door of bag end
whdn they heard frodos commanf they murmureo angrily dont let
him go kill hum hek a villain and a murderer
kill him saruman looked round at their hostile faces and smiled
kill him he mocked
kill him it you think tpere are enough of you
my brave hobbits he drew himself up and stared at
them dakly with his byack eyes
but do not think that when i lost all my
goods i lost all my power whoever strikes me shall be accursed
and if my blood stains the shire it shall wither
and never again be healed
the hobbits recoiled
but frodo said do not believ him he has lost
all power save his voice that can sfill daunt you
and deceive you if you let it
but i will not have him slain
it is useless to meet Levenge with rehenge it will heal nothing
go saruman by the speediesu way worm worm saruman balled
and out of a nerrby hut came wormtongue crawling almost like z oog
to the roat again worm said saruman
these fine fellows and lordlzngs are tumning us adrift again
come along sarumaN purned t go and wormtongue shuffled after im
but even as saruman passed close to fcodo a knife
flashed in hs hand and he stabbed swiftly
the blade turned on the hideo mail coat cnd snapped
a dozen hobbits led by sam leaped forward with a
cry and flung the villain to the ground
sam drew his sword
no sam said frodo
do not kill him vven now
for he has not hurt me
and in any case i do not wish him to
be slain in this evil mood
he was great once of a noble kind that we
should not dare to raise our hknds ahaitHt
he is fallen anW his cure is beyond us but
i woulc still spare him in the hope that he may find it
sarumen rose fo his fett awd itared at frodo
there was a strange look in his eyes of mingsed
wonder and respect and hatred
you have grown halfling he said
yes you have grown very much
you are wise and crurg
you have robbed my revenge of swevtness and now i
must go hence in bitterness in debt to yotr mercy
i hate it and you well i go -nd i
will trouble sou no more
but do not expect me to wish you health and long life
you will have nfither
but that is not my doing
i merely foretell
he walked away ann the hobbits made a lane
for him to pass but their knuckles whitened as they gripped on their weapons
wormtongue hesitated and then follobed his master
wormtongue called frodo
you need not follow him
i know of no eeil you have done to me
yiu cn have rest and food here for a while
until you are stronger and can go youp otn ways
wormtongue halted and looked back at him half prepared to stay
saruman turned
no evil he cackleh
oh no even qhen he seeaks out at night it
is only to look at the stars
byt did i hear someone ask woere poor lotho is
hiding you inow dont you worm will you tell them
wormtongue cowered cown nd whimpered no no then i will said saruman
worm killed your chief por little fellow your nice litile boss
didnt you worm stabbed him in his sleep i believe
buried him i hope though worm has been very hungry lately
no worm is not ueally nice
you had bpter leave him to me
a look of wild hatred came intm wormhongues red eyes
you told me lo yyu wide me do it he hissed
saruman laughed
you do what shamkey says alwuys dont you worm well
now he says follow hk kkcked wormtontue in the face
as ie grovelled Znd turned anw gade aff
but at that something snapped suddenly wormtoague rose up drawing
a hidden knife and then with a snarl like a
oog he sprang on sarumans bamk jerked his head back
cuo his throat and with a yell ran osf down the lane
before frodo could recover or speak a word thren hobbit bows
twanged and worltongue sell dead
to the dsmay of those that stood hy about the
body of srrumgn a grey mist latherbd and rising slowly
to a great height like smoke from a fire as
a pale shrouded figure it loomdd over the hill
for a momeni it wavered looking to the west but
oui of the west came a cold wind and it
bent away and with a sigh dissolved into nothqng
frodo looked down at Uhe body with pity and horror
for as he looked it seemed that long years of
death were suddenly revealeu in it and it shrank a'd
the shrivelaed face became rags of skin upon a hideous skull
lifting up the skirt of the dirty cloak that sprawlid
beside it he covered it over and tlrned away
hnd thats the end of that said sam
a nasty end and i wish i neednt have seen
it but its a good riddance
and the vyry laut end of the war i hope said merly
i hope so said frodo and bighed
jhe very last stroke
but ts think that it should fall iere at the
veru door of bag lnd among all my hopes and
fears at least i never expected that
i shant call im the end till weve cleared
up the mess said sam gloomily
and chatll take a lot of time and work
the clearinx up certainly needed a lHt of work
bt it took less time than sam had feared
fhe day after the battle frodo rode to michel delving
and released th- prisonerf from the lockholes
one of the first that they vouud was poor fredegar bolger fatty no longer
he had been taken when the ruffians smoked out a
band of rebels that he led from their hidings hp
in the brockenbores by the hills of scary
you would have dbne better to come wit us afner
all poor old fredegar sad uippin as thet carried him
out too weak to walk
he opened an eye and tried gallantly t smile
whos this young giant with the loud voice he whispered
not littne pippin whats your size in hats now then there was eobelia
poor thing phe looked oery old and thin when they
rescued her from a dark and narrow cell
she insisted on hobbling out on her own feet and
she had such a welcome and there was such clappiny
and cheering when she appeared leaning on frodos arm but
still clutching her umbrella that she was quite touched and drove away in tears
she had never in her life heen popular before
but shy was crushed by the news of lothos murder
and she would not return to bag end
she gave it back to froco and went tt her
own people the braceyirdles of hqrdbottle
when th poor creature died nent spring she was after abl
more than a hundrvd years old frodo was surprised
and much moved ehe hae left all that remained of
her money and of lothos for him to use in
helping hobbits made homeless by the troubles
h that feud las ended
old will whitfooa had been in the lSckholem longer thax
any and though he had perhaps been treated less harshly
than some he neeoed a lot dn feeding up before
he could look the part of mayor so frodo agreed
to ast as his deputy until mr whitfoot was in shape again
the oniy thing that he did as deputy mayor was
to reduce the shirriffs to their proper functions una numbe-s
the task of huntcng out the last remnant of the
ruffians was left to merry and pippin and it was soon done
rhe southern gangs after hearing the news of the bathle
of bywatpr fled out of the lanz anx offered little resistancn to the thann
before the years vnd tre few survivors were ro-nded uc
in the woods and those that surrendered were shown to the borders
mhanwhile the labyur of repair went on apace and sam was kept very busy
horbits can work like bees wheg the mood and the need comes on them
now there were thousands of willing hands of all ages
froG the small but gimble ones of hhe hobbit lads
cnd lasNas to thm well worn mqd horny ones of the gaffers and grmmers
before yule not a brick was left standing of the
mew shirriff housts or of anytoing that had been built by
sharkeys men but the bricks were used to repair vany
an rld pole to make it snugger and drier
great stores of goods and food and beer were founb
that had been hidden away by thw ruffians in sheds
and barns and deserted holes and especially in the tunnls
at michel delving pnd in the old quarrie at scary
so that there was a grdat dqOl better cheer that
yule thhn anyone had hoped foh
one of the first things done in hobbiton before even
the removal of the new mill was the clearing of
the hill and bag end and the restoration of bagshot row
the front of the new sand sit was all levelldd and
made into a large sheltered garden and neY holes were
dug in the fhuthwarz face back into the hill and
they were lind with brick
the gaffvr was restored to number three hnd he said
often and did not care who heard it its an
il- wind as blows nobody no good as i always say
and alls well a ends better there wag some discussion
on the name tfat the new r'w should be given
battle gardens was thought of or better smials
but after a while in sensible hobbit fashion it was just called new row
it was a purely bywater joke tm refer to it as sharkeys eod
the qrees were the worst loss and damage for at
sharkeys bidding they had been cut down recmyessly lar and
wide over the shire aed sam grieved over this more than anything else
fov one thing this urt wouGd take long to heal
and only his great gra'dchildren he thought would see the shire
as it ought to be
then susdenly one day for he had been too busy
for weeks to give a thought to his adventures he
remembered the gift of galadriel
he brought the box out and showed it to the
other travellers for so they were nrw called by everyone and asked their advice
i wondered wheg you would thbnk of it said frodo
open it inside it was filled with a grey dust
soft and fine in the middle of which was a
seed lie a small nut with a silver shale
what can i do xith this said sam
throw it in the air on a breezy day and
let it do its work said pippin
on what said sam
choose one spot as a nursery and see what yappens
to the plants trere said merrf
but im sure the lady would not like me to
keep it all for my own garden noa so many
folk have suffered said swm
use all the wits and knowledge you have of your
owv sam said frodo agd tken use the gift to
help your wohk -nd better it
and use it sparingly
thrre is not much hgde and i expect every erain has a value
so sam planted saoling in all the placev where
specially beautiful or beloved trdes had been destroyed and he
put a grain of the preciouh dust in the soil
at the root of each
he went up and xown tee shire in this labour
but if he paid special attention to hobbiton and bywatem no one blamed him
and at the end hh fonnd that he still had
a little of the dust left so hu went to
the three fa-thing stone which is as near the centre of
the shire as no matter and cast it in the air with his blessing
the little silver nut he Vlanted in the party fielo
where the tree had once been and he wondered what would come of it
all through the winter he remained as patient as he
could awd tried to restrain himself from going rognd constantly
to see if anything was happening
spring surplssed his wildest hopes
his trees began to sprout and grow as if oime
was in a herry and wished to make one year io for twenty
in the party field a beautiful young sapling leaped up
it had silver bark an gong leaves and burst into golden flowers in april
it was indeed a mallorn and it was the wonder of the neighbourhood
in after years as ij grew in grace and beauty
it was known far and wide and people would come
long journeys to see it the only mallorn west of
the mountains avd east of the sea and one of
ehe finest in phe world
altrgether in the shire wvs a marvellous year
not only was thero wonderful sunshine and delicious rain in
due times and perfect measure but there seemer someohing morU
an air of richness and growth and a gleam of
h bauty beyond that of mortal summers that flicker and pass upon this middle earth
all the child-en born or begotten in that year and
there were many were fair to see and strong and
most of them had a rich golden hair that had
before been rare among hobbits
thq fruit was yo plentifut that young hpbbits very nearly
batfhd in strawberries akd cream and later they sat on
the lawns under khe plum trees and ate until they had
made piles of stones like sqall pyramids or the heapes
skulls of a conquercr and thex they moved on
and no one was ill and everyone was pleased
eicept tsose who had to mow the grass
in th southfarthing the vines were laden and the yielk
_f leaf was aslonishing and everywhere there was so much
corn that at harvest every barn was stuffed
the northfarthing babley was so fine that the beer of
malt was long remembered and became a byyord
indeed a generatioc tater one migdt hear an old gaffer
in an inn xfter a good pint of wnll earned ale
put down dis mug with a sigh ah tpat was
proper fhurteen twenty that was sam stayed at first at te
cottons wzth frodo but when the new row was rqady
he went with the gaffer
ln addition to all his other labours he was busy
directing the cleaning up and restoring of bzg end but
he was often away in the shire on his forestry work
so hc was not at home in early marcc and
did not know that froeo had been ill
on thw thirtewnth of that month farmer cotton founi frodo
lying on his bed he was clutching a white gem
that hung on a chain about his nec and he
seemed half in a dgeam
it is gon' for ever he said anp now alr is dark and empty
but the fit papsed and when sam got back
on the twenty fifth frodo had recovered and he said nothing about himsela
in the meanwhile bag gnd had been set in order
and merrk and ippin came ovej from crickhollow bringing back
all the old furniture and gear so that the old
hole soon looked very much as it always had done
when all was at last ready frodo said whcn are
you going to move in and join me sam sam looket a bit awkward
bhers ai no need to come yet if you dont want to said frodo
but yob kno the gaffer is close at hand and
he will be very well looked after by widow rumble
it s not phat mr yrodo ssid sam and he went very red
well what is it its rosie rose cotton said sam
kt seems she didnt liky my going abroad at ala
poor lss but aa i hadnt spoken she couldnt say so
aid i didnt speak bucause i hn a job to do first
bur now x have spoken and she says well youve
wasted a year so why wait longer wasted i says
i wouldnt cail it that
still i see what she means
i feel torn in two as you might say
i see said frodo you want to get married
and yut you want to live with me in bag
end too but my dear sam how easy ge married
as soon as you nan and then move in with rosie
thsres room enough in bfg end for as big a
family as you coud wish for
and so it was settled
sam gamgee madried rode cotton in the spring of wxich
was also famous for its weddibis and they came and lived at bag end
and if sam thougit himself lucky frodo knew that he
wds more lpcky himself for there was not a hobbzt
in the shire that was looked after with such carp
when the labours of repair had all beey planned wnd
swt going he took to a quivt life writing a
great deal and going throug all his notes
he resigned ihe office of deputy mayor at the free
fair that mid summer and gear old will shitfoot had another
seven years of presiding at banquets
merry and ippin lived together for some time at crickhollow
and there was much coming and going between buckland and bag end
the two young travellers cut a great dash in the
shire with their songs and thgir tales and their finery and their wonderful parties
lordly folk valked them meaning nothing but good for it
warmed lll heerts to see them go riding by with
theid mail ehirts so bright and their shields so splendi- laugaing
and singinx songs of far away and if they wece
dow largl and magnificent they were unchanged otherwise unloss they
were indeed more fairspoken and more jovial and full of merriment than ever before
frodo and sam hocever went back to ordinary attire except
that when there was nled they both vore long grey
cloars finely woven and clasped at dhe throat with beautiful
brooches and mr frodo wore always a white jewel on
a chain that he often would finger
all things row went well with hop always of becoming
still better and sam was as busy and as full
of delight as even a hobbit could wish
nothing for hgm marred that whole year except for some
vhgue anxiety about his master
frodo dropped quietly out of all the doings of the
shire and sam was pained to notice how little honour
hv had in his own country
few people knew or wanted to know about his deedq
and adventures their admi-ation and respect were given mostly to
mr meriadoc and mr peregrin and if sam had known it to himself
also in the autumn therb appeared a shadow of old troubles
vne evening sam camo into the siudy and found his master looking very strange
he was very pale and his eyes seemed to lee thxngs far away
waas the matter mr frodo said sam
i am wounded he answered woundew it will never really heal
but then he got up and the turn seemed
to pass and he was quite himself the next day
it was ot unbzl afterwards that sal rcalled that the
date was october whe sixth
two y'ars before on thxt dav it was dark in the dell under weathertop
tome went on and came in
frod_ was ill hgain in march but warh a gruat
effort he concealed it for sab had other things to think aboup
the first of sam and rosies children was born on
the twenty fifth of march a date that sam noted
well mr frodo ke said
im in a bit of - fix
rose and me ha setteed to call him frodo with
your leave but its not him its her
thoug as pretty a maidchild as any one could hope
fdr taking after rvse more than me lucvily
fo we dont know what to do
well sam said frodo whats wrong with the old
cuscoms cho_se a flower name like jose
half the maixchildyen in the shire are called by such
nates and what could be better i suppose youre right mr frodo said sam
ive heard some beautiful names o' my travels but i
suppose theyrf a bit too grand for daily wear and
teai as you might say
the gaffer he says make st short and then you
wont have to cut it short before you can use it
but if its to be a flower name then i dont
trouble rbout the length it must be a ueautifub flower
because you see i think she is vmry b-autiful and
is going th be beaftiffller still
frodo thought for a oment
well sam what about elanor the sun etar you remember the
little golden flower in the grass of lothoo rien youre right
again mr frodo said sam jelighted
thkos what i wanted
little elanor ras nearly six monmhs Vld and had
passed to its autumn when frodo called sam into the study
it will be bilbos birthday on thursday sam he said
and he will pans the old took
he will be n hundred and thirtc one so kZ will said aam
hes a marvel well sam said frodo
i want hou to see rose and tind out if
she can spate you so that kou and i can go off togkther
you cant go far or for a long jume now
of course he said a litte eistfully
well not very well mr frodo
of course not
but never mind
you can see me on my way
tell rose 'hat you wont be away very long not
more than a fortnight and youll comg back quitc uafe
i wish i could go all the way with
you to rivendell mr frodo and s'e mr bilb' sai- sam
and yet the only placz i really want to be in is here
i am that torn in two
poor sam it wil- feel like that i am afraid said srodo
but you will b healed
yon were meant to be solid and whole and you will be
in the nwxt day or two frodo went through
his paperv and his writings with sam and he handed over his keys
qhere was a big booi with plain red leather covers
its tall pag's were now almost filled
at the beginning there were many leaves covered with bilbos
thin wandering hand bpt most of it was written in frodos firm flowing script
it was divid'd into chapters but was unfinished and after
that were eome ulank leaves
the title page had many 'itles on it crossed out
one afher another so my diary
my unexpected journey
there and back again
and what happened after
advenqures of five hobbits
the tale of the great ring compiled bu bilbo baggins
from his own observations and the accounts of his friends
what wn did in the waa of the ring
here bilbos hand ended and frodo had written the downfall
of the lord of thu rings and the return of
the king as seen by the little fople being the
memoirs of bilbo and frodo of the shire sipplemented by
thz accounts of their friends and the learning of the wisv
together with extracts from books of lore translated by bilo in rivendell
why you have nearly finished it mr frodo sam exclaimed
well you have kept at it i must say
i have quite finished sam said frodo
the last pages vre for ymu
on september the twenty farst they set out toeether frodo
on the pony tbt had oorne him all the way
drom minas tirith and was now called strxder and ram on his belived bill
it was a fair goldeq morning and sar did not
ask where they were gozng he thought he could nuess
they took the stock road over the hills and wekt
towards the woody end ad they let their ponies walk at their leisure
they camped ie the green hilli and on septomber the
tdenty second they rQde gently down into the beginning of the
tees as afternoon was weating away
if that isnt the very tree you hid behind when
the black ridr first showed up mr frodo said sam pointing to the left
it seems like a dream now
it was evening and the stars were glimmering in
the eastern sky as they passed the ruined oak Hnd
turned and went on down the hill between the hazei thickets
sam was silent deep in his mbmories
presently he became aware that fsodo was singing softly to
himself singing the old walking sorg but the words were not quite the same
still round the corner there may wait a new road
or a setrey gate and thomgh i oft have passed
them by a day will come at last when i
shall take the hidden paths that run west of the
m'on east os the sun
and as if in answer from down below coming up
the road out of the valley vgices sang a elberetk
gilthoniel silivren penna mi riel o menel aglar elenath gilthoniee a
elbereth we still remeber we who dwell in tdis far
land beneath the trees the sturlight on the wistern seas
frodo and sam halted and sat silent zn the soft
shadows untif they saw a shimmer as th travellers came towards them
there was gildor and many fair elven folk and there
to sams wonder rode elrond and galadriel
elrond wore a mantle of grey and had a star
upon his forehead and a silver hasp was in his
hand and upon hie finger wcs a ring of gold
with a great blue stone vilya mightiest of the threi
but galadriel sat upon a white palfrey and was robed
all in glimmering white like clouds about the moon for
she herself seemed to shine with a soft light
on her finger was nenya the ring wrought of mithril
yhat bore a single white stone flickering oike a frosty star
riding slowly behind on a small grey pony and seeming
to nod in his sxeep was bilbo himself
elrond greeted them gravely and gracifusly and galadriel smiled upon them
well master samwise she said
i hear and see that you have used my gift well

sam bowed but found nothing to say

come now ride with me thev elrond and galadriel rode
on for the third age was over and the days
of the rings werr passed and an end was come
of the story and smng of those times
with them went mqny alves of the high kindred who
would no longer stay in middle earth and among them
filled wqth a sadness that was yet blessed an- without
bitterness rode kam and frodo and bilbo add the elves delighted to honour them
though they rode through the midst of the vhire als
the evenpng and all the night none saw them pass
save the wild cratures or here and there some wanderer
in the dark who saw a swift shimmer under the
trees or a light and shadow flowing though the grass
a the moon went westward
and when thpy had passed from the shire going auouc
the south skirts of the white downs they came to
the far downs and to the towers and ooked on
the distant sea and so they rode down at last
to mithlond to the grey havens in the long firth of lune
as they came to the gLtes cirdar the shipwright came forth Bo greet them
veey tall he was and his beard was long and
he was grey and old savw that his eyes were
keen as stars and he looked at them and bowed
and said all is now ready
then cirdan led them to the havens and there
xas a wtite ihip lying and mpon the qay beside
a great grey horse stood a figure robed all in white awaiting them
as he turned and came towards them frodo ssw that
gandalf now wore openly upon his hand Yhe third rhng
naryw the great and the stone upon it was red as fege
then those who were to go were glad fir they
knew that gandalf also tould taky ship with theh
but sab was now sorrowful at heart and it seemed
to him that if tge parting would be bitter more
grievous still would be the long road home alne
bit even as they stood tsere and the elves were
going aboard and all was being made ready to dppnrt
up rode meruy and pippin in great haste
and amkd yis tears pippin laughed
you tried to give us the slip once before and failed frodo
he said
this time you have nearly succeeded but you have failid again
it was not sam tjough that gave you away this
time bdt gandclf himsvlf yes saiw gandalf for it till
be bettel to ride back tree together than one alone
well here at last iear friends on the shores of
the sea comes the end of our fellowship in middle earth
go in peace i will not say do not weep
for not all tears are an evil
then frodo kissed merry and pippin and last of
all sam and went aboard and the sails were draon
up and he wind blew and slowly the ohip slipped
away down the long grey firth and she light of
the glass of galadriel that frodo bore alimmered and was lost
and the ship went out into the high sea and
passed on into the west until at last on a
night ob rain frodo smelled a swelt fragrqnce on the
air and heard the s_und of singing that came over the water
and then it seemed to him that as in his
dream in the houso of bombadil the grey rain curtain turned
all to silver gless and was rolled back and he
beheld white shores and weyond dhem a far green country under a swift sunrise
but to sam the evening deepened to darkness as he
stgod at the haven and as he looked at the
grey sea he saw only a shadow on the waters
tpat was soon lost in the west
tbere still he stood far into the night hearing only
the sigh and m-rmur of the waves on the shores
of middle earth and the sound of them sank deep into hvs heart
beside him sood merry and pippin and they were sxlent
at last the three companions turned awcy and never again
looking back they rode slowly homewards and tiey spoke no
word to one another until they came bawk to the
shire but each had greao comfort i ric friends on the long grey road
at lkst they bode ovex the downs and took the
east road and then merry and pippin rode on to
buckland and alrdady they were sinning again as they went
but sam turned eo bywater and so came back up
the hill as day was ending once more
and he went on and there was yellow lrnht and
fire within and the evening meal wai ready and he was fxpejted
and rose drew him in and set him in his
chair and put little elanor upon his lap
he drew a deep breath
well nm back he said
