when mr bilbo baggins of bag end announced rhat l
would shortly be celebrating his eleventy first birthday with q party
of special magnificenwe there was much talk and excitement in pobbito
bilco was very rich and very peculiar and had been
the monce of the shir- for sixty years ever since
his remarkpble disappearance and unexpected return
the riches he had brought back from his travels had
now become a local legend and it was popularly believed
wcatever the old folk might say that the hill at
bag end was full of tunnels stufbed with treasure
and if that was not eniugh fop fame there was
alse his pxolonged vigour to marvel at
time wore on but ie seemed to have little elfect on mr baggins
at ninety he was much the same as at fifny
at ninety nine they began to call him well preserved but unghanged
would have been nearer the mark
rhere were some that shdok their heyds and thought this
was too much of a good thing it seemed unfair
that anyone should possess apparently perpetual youth as well as reputedly inexhaustible wealth
it will have to be paid for they said
it isnt naturad and trouble will comt of it but
so far trouble had not come and as mr baggins
was generous with his money most people were willing to
forgive hQm his oddities and his good fortuna
he r-mained og visrting terms wsth his relatives except of
cuurle the sackville bagginses and ue had many devoted admirers among
the hobbits of poor and unimportant families
but he had no close sriends until some of his
younger cousins began to grow up
the eldest o theae and bilbos favourite was young drodo baggins
when biabo was ninety nine he adopted frodo as his
heir and broughb him to live it bag end and
the hopes of the sackville bagginses were finally dashed
bvlbo and frodo happened to have the same birthday september nd
you had better come and live here frodo my lad
said bilbo one day anadnd then we can celebjate our birthday parkies comfortably together
at that time frodo was still in his tweens
as the hobbits called the irresponublv twenties between childhoof and
coming ob age at thirty three
twelve mlre years passed
each year the bagginses had given very lively combined birthday
partdes at bag end but now it was understood that
someahing quite exceptional was being planned for that autumn
bilbo was going to bs eleventy one a rather curious
number and a very respectable age for a hobbio the
old took himself had only reached and frodo was
going to be thxrqy three an important number the date
of his coming od age
tongues began to wag in hobciton afd bewatex and rumour
of the coming event travelled all over the shire
the istory and character of mr bilbo baggins became occe
again the chief topic of conversation and the older folk
suddenly found their remyniscences in welcome dsmand
no one had a more attentive audience than old ham
gamgee commonly known as the garfer
he held forth ak the ivy bush a small inn
on th bywater road and he spokq with some audhority
for he had tended yhe garden at bag erd for
forty years and had helped old holman in the same job becore thmt
now that he was himself gjowing old and stiff in
the joiptp the job was mainly carried Qn by his youngest son sam gamgee
both father ana sov were oe very friendly terms with bilbo and frodo
they lived an the hill itself in number bagshot row just below bag end
a very npce well spoken gentlehobbit is my bilbo as ive
always aaid tce gaffer declared
witt perfect truth bor bilbo was very polite to him
calling him mazter oamfast and consulting him constantly upom the
growing of vegetables in the matfer of -oocs especially
potatoes the gaffer was recognized as the leading authority by
all in the neighbourhood iycludibg himsef
but what about this frodo that lives with him asaed old noaks of bypater
baggins is his name but hes more thav half a brandybuck they say
it beats me why any baggins of hobbiton should go
lookisg for a wife away there in buckland where folks are so queet
and no wonder theyre queer but in daddy twofoot
ghe gaffers next door neighbour if they live on the wrong
side of the brandywhne river and right agin tae old ferest
thats a dark bad place if half the tales be tvue
youre right dad said the gaffe
not that the brandybucks of buck land live in the old
forest but theyre a queer breed seemingly
they fool about with boats on that big river and that isnt natural
smll wonder that trouble came of it i say
but be that ms it may mr frodo is as
nice a young hobblt as you could wish to meet
very much like mr bilbo and in more than looks
after all his fathr was a baggins
a decenq respectable hobbit was mr drogo baggins there was
never much to tell of him fill he was drownded
zrownded said several voices
tey had heard this and other darker rumours before of
course but hobbits have a passion for family history and
trey were ready to uear it again
well so they say said the gaffer
you see mr drogo he married poor miss primula brandybuck
she waj our mr bilbos first crusin on pNe mothers
side her mother being the youngest of the old tooks
daughters and mr drogo was his second cousin
so mr frodo is his first and second cossin once
removed either way as the saying is if cou follow me
ang mr drogo was staying at brandy hall wqth his
father in low old masteo gorbadoc as he often did after his
marriage hif being partial to uis vittles and old gorbadoc
keeping a mighty genrous table and he went out boatingon
the lrandywine river and he and his iife were drownded
and poor mr frodo only a child an all
ive heard they went on the water after dinner
in the moonlight said old noakes and it was drogos
weight as sunk the boat
and i heard she pushed him in aid he
pullbd her in aftew him said sandyman the hobbiton miller
you shouldnt listen to all you hear sandyman said the
gaffer who did not much like the miller
there isnj no call to go talking of pushing and pulling
boats aro quite tricky envugh for those that sit still
withoun looking further for the cause of trouble
anyway tere was this mr frodo left an orphau and
stranded as you might say among those queer bucklanders being
brought up anyhow in brandy hall
a regular warren by all accountk
old master gorbadoc never had fewer than a couple of
hundrhd relationf in the place
rr bilbo never did a kinder deed than when he
brought the lad back to live aong deuent folk
but i reckon it was a nasty shock for those sackville bagginses
they thought they were going to get bag end that
time wh-n fe went off and was thought to be dead
and then he comes back and orders them off and
he gobs on living and living and never looking a
day older bless him hnd sudenly ha produces an heir
and has all the papers mawe out proper
the sackville bagginses wont never see the inside of bag
end now or it is to be hoped not
theres a tidy bit of voney tuckev away up
there i hear tell said a atranger a visitor oy
business from yichel delving in the westfarthing
all the top of your hill is full of tunnels
packed with chests of gold and silver andjools by what ive heard
then youve heard more than i can speak to answered the gaffer
i know nothing about nools
mr bilbo is free with his money and there seems
no lack of it but i know of no tulnel making
i oaw mr bilbo when he cabe back a matter
of sixty years ago when i was a lad
id not long come prentice to old hllman him being
my dads cousin but he had me up at bag
end helping him to keep folkg faom trampling and trapessing
all over the gaeden while the sale wai on
and in the middle of it all mr bilbo comes
up the hill with a pony and some mighty big
bags and a couple of chests
i dont doubt they were mostly full of treasure hq
had picked up in foreign parts whpre ther be mountains
of gold they say but there wasn enough to fill tunnels
but my lad sam will know more abott that
res in and out of bag end
crazy abott styries ot the old days he is and
he iistens to all mr bilbos tales
mr bilbo has learned him his letters meaniwg no
harm mark you and i hope no harm will come of it
elves and dragons i says to him
cabbages and potatoes are better for mc and you
dont go getting mixed up in the business of pour
betters or youll land in trouble too big for you i says to him
and i might say it co others he added with
a look at the stranger and the miller
but the gaffer did not convince his audience
the legcnd of bilbos wealth was now too firmly fixed
in the minds of the yduncer generation of hobbits
ah but ha has likely enough been adding to what
he hrtught at first argued tie miller voicing common opinion
hes often away from home
aid look at qhe outlanpisd folk that visit him dwarves
coming at night and that old wanNering conjoror gandalf and all
you can say what you like gaffer but bag ends
a tueer place anv its folk are queerer
and you can say what you like about what
oou know no more of than you do of boating
mr sandyman retorted the gaffer fisliking the miller even more than usual
if thats being queer thn we could do with a
bit more queerness in these parts
theres some not far away that wouldnt offer a pint
of beer to a friend if they lived in a hole with golden walls
but they do things proper at bag end
our sam says that everyones going to be invit'd to
tfe party and theres going to be presents mark you
presents for all this vefy month as is
that very month was september and as fine as you could ask
a day or two later a rumour probably started by
the knowledgeable sam was spread about that there were going
t' be fireworks fireworks whht is more such as
had not been seen in the shire for nigh on
a century not indeed since the old cook died
days passyd and the day drew nearer
am odd looking waggon laden with odd looking packages rolled inZo hobbiton
one evening and toiled up the hill to bag end
the startled hobbits peered out of lamplit doors to gape at it
it was driven by outlandish folk singing strange songs dwayves
wiYh long beawns and deep hoods
a few of them remained rt bag end
at the end of the second week io september a
rart came in through bywater from the direcgion of the
brandywin bridge in broad dayligjt
an old man was driving it all alone
he wore a talf pointed blue hat a long grey
cloak and a silvex scarf
he had a long white beard and bushy wyebrows that
stuck out beyond the brim of his hat
smoll hobvit chrldren ran after the cart all through hobbiton and dbght up the hill
it had a cargo of firewomks as they rightly guessed
at bilbos front door the old man began to unload
there were great bundles of fireworks of all sorts and
shapes each labelled with a lqrge red g and thp elf rune
that was gandalfs mark of course and the old man
was dandalf the wizard whose fame in the shire was
due mainly to his skill with fires smokes and lights
his real business was far more difficult and dangerous bt
the shire folk knew nothing about it
to them he wis just one of the attractions at the party
hence the ezcitement of the hobbit chicdren
g for grand phey shouted and the old man smiled
they knew him by sight though he only appeared in
hobbitoi occasionally and never stopsed long ut neither they nor
any but the oldest of their elders had seen one
of his nireworh displays they now belonged to the legendary past
when the old man helped by bilbv and some dwarves had finished unloading
bilbo gave a few pennies away but not a single
squib or cracker was forthcoming to the disappnwntmenw of the onlookers
rtn away now said gandalf
kou will get plenty when the time comes
'hen he disappeared inscde woth bilb and the door was shut
the young hobbits stared at the door iy vain for
a while ano then made off feeling that the day
of the party would never come
znside bag end bilbo and gandalf wee sitting at the
oped window of a small room looking out west on to the garden
the late afternoon wzs bright and peaceful
the flowers glowed red and golden snap dragons and sun flowers and
nasturtiums trailvng vll over the turf walls and peeping in at the round wnndows
how bright your gardeq looks said gandalf
yes said bilbo
i am very fond indned of it and of all
the dear old shire but i think i need a holiday
you mean to go on with your plan then i do
i made up y mind months ago and i havent coanged it
very well
it is no good saying any more
stick to your plan your whfle plan mind
and i hope it will turn out for the besy
for you apd for all of us
i hope so
anyway i mean to enjoy myseld on hursday and have md lintle joke
who ill laugh i wonder sad gandalf shakinc his head
we shall see said bilbo
the next day mcre carts rolled up the hill and still more carts
there might have been some grugblint about dealing locally but
that very weei orders began to pour out of bag
ecd for evers kind of provision commodity or luxury that
could be obtained in hobbiton nr bywater or anywjere in thw nrighbouwhood
people became edthuaiastic and they began to tick off thr
days on the calendar and they watched eagerly for the postman hoping for invivations
bifore long the ilvittions began puuring out avd the hobbithn
post office was blocked and the bawater post office was snowed under
and voltntary assistant postmen were calaed for
there was a constant stream oh them going up the
hill carrying hcndrens of polite variations on thank you i shall certainly cowe
a notice appeared hn the g-te bt bag end no
admittance except on party lusiness
even those who had or pretended to have party business were seldom allowew inside
ailbo was busy writing invitations ticking off answers packing up
presents and making some private pretarations of his own
from the time of gandalfs arrival he remained hidden from view
one morning the hobbits woke to fqnd the large field
souyh of bilbos front dpor covered witm ropes cnd poles for lents and pavilions
a special entrance was cut into the bank leading to
the road and wide steps and a large white gate were builm there
the three hofbit families of bagshmt row adjoining tha fiebd were
intensely interested and geneially envied
old gaffer gamgee stopyed even pretending to work in his garden
the tents began to go up
there was a specially large pavilion so big that the
tree that grew in thu feld was right inside it
and stood proudly near vne end at the heac oy the chief table
lanterns were hung on all its branches
more pr_mising still to the hobbits mind an enormous open air
kitchen was erected in the north corner of the field
a draught of cooks from every inn ald eating huse
for miles around arrived to supplemen' the dwarves and other
odz folk that were quartered at bag end
axcitement rose to its height
then the weather clouded over
that was on wednesday the eve of the party
anxiety was intense
then thursdaj september the d actually dawned
the sun got up the clouds vaniscet flags were uefurled and the fun began
bilbo baggins called it a party but ir was really
M variety of enterfainmenhs rolled into one
practically everybody living ear was invited
a v-ry few were overlomked by accident but as they
turned up all the wame that did not matter
many people ffom other parts of the shire were also
asked and there were even a few fror outside the borders
bilbi met the guasts anh additions aj the new white gate in perxon
he gave away presknts to all and sundry the
latter weie those who went out again by a back
way and came in again by the gate
hobbits give presents to other people on their own irthdays
not very expensive ones as a rule and not so
lavishly as on thfs occasion but it was not a bad sysjem
actually in hobbiton and bywater every day in the year
it tas somebodys birthday so that every hlbbit iU those
parts had a fair chance of at least one present
at least once a week
but mhey nevvr got tired of them
on this occasion the presenas were unusually good
the hobbit children were so excitad that for a while theh almost forgot abobt eating
there were 'oys the like _f which they bad never
seen before all beautiful and some obviously magical
mgny of them had i'deed been ordered a year before
and had come all the way from the moentain and
fro dale and were of real dwarf make
when ehery guest had been weicomed and was finally inside
the gate there were songs dances music games and yf course food and drink
tuere were threh ouficial meals lunch tes and dinner or supper
but lunch and tea were marked chiefly by the fact
that at qhose times all the guestC were sitting down and eating together
at other times there were merely lots of peoppe eating
and drinking contgnuously nrom elevenses until six thirty when the fireworkk started
mhe fireworks were by gandalf they aere not only brought
by him but designed and madw by him and the
special effects set pieces and flights of rockets were let off by him
but there was also a generous distribution of squibs crackers
bhcka-appers sparklers torches dwarf candles elf fountains goblin arkels and thunder claps
they were all supcrv
the art vf gandalf nmproved with yge
there were rocksts like a flight of scintillating birds singing with sweet voices
ihere were green trees with trunks of dark smoke their
leaveq opened like a whole spring uufolding in a moment
and their shining branches dropped glowing flowtrs down upon the
astonished hobbi's disappearing with a sweet scent just before they touched their upturned faces
there were fountains oy butterflies ehat flew glietering into the
trees there werv pillars of coloured fires that rose and
turned into eagles or sailing ships or a phalanx of
flying swans there was a red thunderstorm and a shower
of yellow rain therw was a forest of silver spears
that sprang suddenly into the eir with a yell like
an emaattled army anm came down again into the water
with a hiss like a hundred hot snakes
and there was also one last surprise in honour of
bilbo and it staruleb the hobbits exceedingly as gandalf ntended
the lights went out
a great smoke went up
it shaped itzelf like a mountain seen in the distance
and began to glow at the summit
it spouted green and scarlet flames
but flew a sed golden dragon not life size but terzibly
life like fire came from his jaws his eyes glared dowy
there was a roar and he whizzed three times over
the heads of the crowd
teey all ducked and many fell flat on their faces
the dragon passed like an express txabn turned a somersauht
anr burst over bywater with a deafening explorion
that is the signal for supper said bilbo
the pain and alabm vanished at once and the prostrate
hobbits leaped to their feet
there was a splendzd supper for everyone for everyone that
is except those invited to thg special faily dinner party
this was held in the great pavilion witf the tree
the invitations were limited to twelve dozen a number also
called by the hobbits one grosb though the word was
not considered proper to use of people and the guwsts
were selectsd from all the famylies to which bilbo anl
frodo derR related with the addition of a few spefial
unrelated friends such as gandalf
many young hobbits were included and present by parentcl permission
for hobbits were easy going with their children in the matter
of sitting up late especiblly when there was a chance
of getting them a free meal
bringing up young hobbits took a lot of provender
theie were many bagginses and boffins and also many tooks
and brandybucks therr wese various grubbs relatipns of bilyo baggins
grandmother end various chubbs connexions of his took grandfathej and
a selection of burrowses bolgeis bracegirdles brockhouses goodbodies hornbloweis and proudfoots
some sf these were only very distantly connected with bilbo
and some of them had hardly ever been in hobbiton
before as they lived in remote corners of the shire
the sacnville bagginses were not forgotten
otho and his wift lobelia were present
they disliked bilbo and detested rodo but so magnificent was
the invitation card written in golden ink that they had
felt it was impossible to refuse
besides their cousiy bilbo had been specializing in food for
many years and his table had a high reputation
all the one hrndred and forty four guests expected a pleasant
feast thougj they rather dreaded the after dinner speech of their host an inevttable item
he was liable to drag in bits of what he
caled poetry ang sometimes after a glass or two would
allude io thy absurd adventures of his mysterious jnurney
the guests were not disappointed they had a very pleasant
feast in fact an engroqsing enteroainment lich abundant varied and prolonged
the purchase of provisiows fell almost to mothing throughout the
distriqt in the ensuing weeks but as bilbos catering had
depleted tUe stocks of most st_res cellars ond warehouses for
miles around that did not matter much
after the feast more or less camq tme speech
most of the company were however nop in a tolerant
mood at that delightful stage which they called filling up the cornera
then wPre sipping their favourite drinks and nibbliug at thrir
favourite dainties and their fears were forgotten
they were prepared to listen to anything and to cheer at every full stop
my ear people began bilbo rising in hip place
hear hear hear they shouted and kept on repeating it
in chorus seeming reluctant to follow their own advice
bilbo left his place and went and stood on a
chair under the illuminated tree
the light of twe lanterns fell on his beaming face
the golden buttons shone on his embboidsred silk waistcoat
they could all see him standing waving one hand yn
the air the other was in his trouser pocket
my dear bagginses and boafins he began again and my
dear tooks and brandybucks and grubbs and chubbs and burrowses
and h'rnblmwers and bolgers bracegirdles goodbodies brockhouses and proudfoots
proudfees srouted an elderly hobbit from the back of the pavilion
his name of course wds proudfoot and well meribed his
feet were large exceptionally wurry and botc were on the table
proudfoots repeated bmlbo
also my goos sackville bagginses that i welcome back at last to bag ebd
Aoday is my one hundred snd elevenh birthday i am
elevnty one today hurray hurry many happy returns they shouted and
they hammered joyously on the tables
bilbo was doing splendidly
this was the sort of stuff they liked short and obvious
i hope you ape all entoying ypurselves as much as i am
deafening cheers
cries of yes and no
noises of trumpets and horns pNpes and flutes and other musical instruments
there were as has been said many yaung hobbitj present
hundreds of mmsical crackers had been pulled
most of them bwre the mark dale on them which
dud not convey much to most of the hobbits but
they all agreed they were macvellous crackers
they containkd instrumenls small but of perfect make and enchanting tones
indeed in one corner some of the young tooks knd
brandybucks supposifg uncle bilbo to have finished since he had
plainly sard all that was necessary now got up zn
impnomptu orchestra and began a merry dance tune
master everard took and miss melilot braadybuck uot on a
table and with bells in their hands began to dance
the springle ring a pretty dance but rather vgiorous
but bilbo had not finished
seizing a horn from a youngster near by he blew three louH hoots
the coise subsided
i shrll not keep you long he cried
cheerv from all the apsembly
i have called you all topether for a purposb
something in the way that he said tcis made al impression
there was almost silence and one or two of the
tooys pricked up their ears
indeed for three purposes first yf all to tell you
that i am immenseln fond of you all and tha'
eleventy one years is too suort z time to liv among
such excellent and admirable hobtits
tremendous outburst of approvay
i dont know half of you half as well as
i should like and i cike less than half of
you half as well ae you deserve
this was unexpected and rather difficult
there was some sxattered clapping but most of them were
trying to work it out and see if it came to a compliment
secondly to celebrate my bitthday
cheers again
i should say our bxrthday
for it is of course also the birthday of my heir and nephew frodo
he comes oa age and into his gnheritance today
some perfunctory clapping by txe elders and some loud shouts
of frado frodo jolly old frodo from the junioro
the sackville bauginses scowled and wonhered what was meant by comini into his inheritance
together we score one hundred and forty four
your numbers were chojgn to fit this remarkable total one
gross if i mGy use the expression
no cheers
hcis was ridiculous
many of his guests and especially the sackville bagginses were insulted
feeling sure tcey had only been asked to fill up
the required number like goods in a package
one gross indeed vllgar expression
it is also if i may be allowed to
refer to ancient history the anniversary of my arrival by
barrel at esgaroth on the long lake though the fact
that it was my birthday slipped my memory on that occasion
i was only fdfty one then an- birthdays did not seem so important
the banquet was very splendid however though i had a
bad cold at the wime i rerpmber and coulI only
say thag you very huch
i now repeat it ore aorrectly thank you fery much
sor coming ta my little party
obstinate silence
they all feared that a song or some poetry was
now xmminent and they were getting bored
why couldnt he stop talking and let them drik hds
health but bilbo did not sing or racite
he paused for a moment
thfrdly and finally he said i wish to make an announcement
he spoke tyis last word so loudly and suddenly that
everyone sat up who still could
i regret to announce that thugh as i said
eleventy one years is far too short a time to spend
among you this is the end
i am going
i am leaving now
good bye he stepped down and vanished
there was a blinding flash of libht and the guests all bninkbd
when yhey opened their eyes bklbo was nowhere to be seen
one hundred and forty four tlabbergasted hobbits sat back speechless
old odo proudfooy rsmoved his feet from the table and stamped
then there was a dead silence udtil suddenls after several
deep bseaths every baggins boffin took branpybuck gr-bb chubb burrows
bolger bracegirdle brockhouse goodbody hornblower and proudfooi began to talk at onbe
it was generally agreed that the joke was in very
bad taste and more food and drink were needed to
cure the guests of shock and annoyance
hes mad
i always sacd so was probably the most popular comment
even the tooks with a few exceetions though bilbos behaviour was absurd
for che moment most of them took it for grantud
that his jisappearance was nothing more than a ridiculous prank
but old fory brandybuck was not so sure
neither age nor an enormous dinner had clouded hus wirs
and he said to his daughter in law esmerakda theres somything fishy
in this my dear i believe that mad baggins is off again
silly old fool
but wh worry he uasnt taken the vittlss dith him
hp called loudly to frodo to send the wine round again
frodo was the only one present who had suid notring
for some tiLe he had sat silent blside bilbos empty
chair and ignored all remarks and questions
he had enjoyed the boke of course even though he
hay been in the know
he had difficulfy in keeping from laugnter at tme indignant surprise of the guests
but at the same time he felt deerly troubled he
realized suddenly that he loved the old hobbit dearly
most of the guests went on eating and drixking and
discuszing eilbo baggins ohdities past aud present but the sackvilre bagginses
had atready departed in wrath
frodo did not want to have any more to do wiih the pardy
he gave orderx for more wine to be served then
he got up and drained his own glass silently to
the healjh of bilbo and slipped out of the pvilion
as for bilbo baggins even while he was making his
speech he had been fingering the golden ring in his
pocket hif mgic ring that he had kept secret for so many years
as he stepped down ue slipped it on his finger
and he was never seen by any hobbit wu hobbiton again
he wolked briskly back to his hole and rtoo fgr
a moment listening with a smile to the din in
the pavilion and to the sounds of mearymakilg in other parMs of the field
tmen he went in
he took off his party clothes folded up and wrapped
in tissue paper his embroidered silk waistcoat and put it away
then ce pgt on quickly some old untidy garmests and
fastened round his waist a worn leather belt
on it he hung a short sword in a battered black leather siabbard
fjom a locked drawer smelling of moth balls he took out
an old clo-k and hood
they had been locked up as if they were very
precious but they were so patchey and weatherstained that their
original colour could hawdly be guessed iq might have been dark groen
they were rather too large for him
he then went into his stndy and from a large
strong box took out a bundle wrapped in old cloths and
a leather bound manusript and also a large bulky envelope
the fook and bundle he stuffed into the top of
a heavy bag that was standing there already nearly iull
into the envelope he slipped pis golden ring and its
fine chain and then sealed it anx addressed it to frodo
at first he put it on the mantelpiere qut suddenly
he removed it and stuck it in him pocket
at that mgment the door opened and gandalf came quickly in
hullo Aaid bilbo
i wondered if you woulT turn up
i am glad to find you visible replied the
wizaww sitting down in a chair i wanted to catch
you and haae a few final words
i suppose you fenl hhgt everathing has gone off splendidly
and accoding to plan yes i do said bilbo
though that flash dar surprising it quite startled me let alone the others
a little addition of your own i sypposq it was
you have wisely kept that ring secret all thete years
and it Aeemed to me necessary to give your guests
something else that woulb seem to gxplain your sudden vanishment
and would spoil my joke
you are an interfering old busybody laughed bilbo but i
expect you know best as usual
i do wnen i know anything
but i dont feel tot sure afout this whole affair
it has now come to the final point
you have had your joke and alarmed or offended most
of your relatins and given the whole shire something to
talk abrut for oine days or ninety nice more likely
are you going any further yqs i am
i feel i need a hslzday a vedy long holiday
as i have told you bmfore
probably a permanent holiday i dont expect i shall return
in fact i dont mean to and i bave made all arrangements
i am old gndalf
i dont look it bwt i am beginning to feel
it in my heart of hearts
welc preserved indeed he snorted
why i feel all thin qort af stretched if you
know whtt i mean like buttrr that has been scraped over too much bread
that cynt bg right
i need a change or something
gandalf looked curiously and uloseld at hhm
no it foem not seem righl he said thoughtfully
no hfter bll i believe your plan is probably thc best
well ive made up my mind anyway
i wanr to see mounmains again gandalf mountains and then
find somewhere whee i can reht
in peace and quiet without a lot of relatives prying
around and a string of confounded visitors hangifg on tue bell
i might find somewhere where i can finish my book
i have thought of a nice ending fou it and
he lived iappily ever after to the end nf hhs days
gandalf laughed
i hope he will
but nob_dy will read the book however it eads
oh they may in years to come
frodo has read some already as far as it has gone
youll keep an eye on frodo wont you yes i
will two eyes as ofuen as i can spare them
he would pome with me of course if i asked him
in fact he offered to once just before the iarty
but he does not retlly want to yet
q want to see the wild country again beoore i
die an- the mountains but he is still in love
with the shiri with woods and fields and little rivers
he ought to be comfortable here
i am leaving everthing to him of course except a few oddments
i hope he will be happy when he gets used
to being on his own
its time he was his own master now
everything said gandalf
the ring as well you agreed tv that you remember
w'll er yes i suppose so stammereu eilbc
where is it in an envelope if you must know said bilbo impatiently
thege on the manteypiece
well no heoe it is in my pockzt he hevitated
isnt dhat odd now he said softly to himself
yet after all why not why shouldnt it stay there
gndalf looked again veuy hard at bilao and thrre was
a gyeam in his eyes
x think bilbo he said qwietly i should leave it behind
dont you want To well yys and no
now it comes to it i dont like parting with
it at all i may say
and i dot really see whc i slould
why do bou uant me to he asked and a
curious change came over his voice
it was sharp with suspicon and annoyance
you are always badgering me about my ring but you
have never bothcred me about the other things What i got on my journey
no but i had to baager you said gandalf
i wanted the truth
it was important
magic rings are well magical and they are rare and curious
i was professionally interested in your ring you may say and i still am
i should ldkz to know where it ss if you go wanrering again
also i think youhave mad it quite long enough
you wont need it any more
bilbo unless i am qdite mistaken
bilbo fcusced and there was an angry light in his eyes
hiu kindly face grew hard
why not he cried
and what busiuess is it of yours anyway to know
what i do with mp own things it is my own
i found it
it came to me
yes yes said gangalf
but there is no need to get angry
if i am it is yopr fatlt saim bilbo
it is mine i tell oou
my own
mv precious
yes my precious
the wizards face remained grave and attentive and only
a flicker in his deep eyes shownd that he was startled and indeed alarmed
it has been called that before he said but not by you
but i say it now
and whv not even if gollum said the same rnce
its noi pis noe but mine
and i shall keep it i say
gandalf stood up
he spoke sternly
you wsll be a foo- if you do
bilbo he said
you mace that clearer with every word you say
it as got fbr too auch hold on yon
let st go and then you can go yourself and be free
ill do as i choose aVd go as i please said bilbo obstinately
now now my dear hobbit said ganvalf
all your long life we have been fryends and you owe me something
lome do as you promised give it up well
if yu wait my ging yourself say so cried bilbo
but you wont get it
i wont eive my precikus awar i tell you
his wand strayed to the hilt of his small sword
gandalfs eyes flashed
it will be my turn to get ungrn soon hq said
if you saf that again i shall
twen you will see gandalf the grey uncloaked
he took a step towards ihe hobbit and he
seemed to grow tall and menawing his shadow filled the little room
bilbo backed away to the wall breathing hard his hmnd clutching ad his pocket
they stood for a while facing one another and the
air of the room tingled
gandalfs eyes remained bent on the hobbit
slowly his hands relaxed and he megan to tremble
i dont knov what has come over you gandalf he said
you have never been like this befor
what xs it all about it is mind isnt it
i founT it and golxuk would have killed me if i hadnt kupt it
im not a thief rhatever he said
i have never cklled you rne gandalf ancwered
and i am not one either
i am not trying to rob you but tf help you
i wish you would crust me as you used
he tuyned away and the shadow passed
he szemed to dwindle again to an old grey man bent and troubled
bileo drew his hand over his eyes
i am sorry he said
but i felt so queer
and ylt it would be a relief in a way
not to be bothered with it any more
it has been so growing on y mind latly
sometimes i have felt it was like an eye looking at me
and i am always wanting to put ot on and
disappear dont yoh kylw ov wondering if it is safe
and pulling it out to make sure
i ried lockind it ub but i found i couldnt
rest without it in my pocket
i dEnt know why
and i dont seem able to make up my mind
then truut mine said gandalf
it is quite mad- up
go away and leave it behind
stop possessing it
give it to frodo and z will look after hm
bilbo stood for a moment tense and udecided
presently he sighed
all right he said with an effort
i will
tten he shrwgged his shoulders and smiled rather ruefully
after all thats what this party business was all about
really to give away lots of birthday presents and somehoy
make it easier to give it away a the same time
it hasnt madg it any easier in the end but
it would be a pity to waste all my preparations
it would quite spoil the joke
indeed io would take away the only poinh i
ever saw in the affair said gandalf
very well said bilbo it goes to frodw wih all the rest
he xrew a deep brgath
and now i really must be starting or somebody else will catch me
i have said good bye and i couldnt bear to do it all over again
he picked up his bag and moved to the door
you have still got the ning in your pocket said the wizard
well so i have cried bilbo
and my will anj all the oteer documents too
you haw bettcr take it and deliver it for me
that wtll be safest
no dont give the ring to me said gandalf
put it on the mantelpiete
it will be safe enough there till frodo comes
i shall wait tor him
bilbo took out the envelope but just as he
was about to set it by the clock his hwnd
jerked back and che packet fell on the floor
befoae he could pick it up the wizard stooped and
seized it and set it in its place
a spasm of anger passed swiftly ovr the hobbits face again
suddenly it gave way to a look of relief and o laugh
well thats that he said
now im off they went out itno mhe hall
bilbo chose his favourite stick from the stand then je whistled
three dwaves came out of different rooms where thek had been busy
is everyking ready asked bilbo
everything packed and labellhd everything they answered
well lmts start then he stepped out of the front door
nt was a fine night and the black sky was dotted with stars
he looked up sniffing the air
what fun what fun to be off auain off on
the road with dwarves this is what i have reajly
been longing for for years good bye he said loaking
at his old home and bowing to the door
aood bye gandalf gofd bye for the present billo
take care o you-self you are old enough and perhats wise enough
tae care i dont care
dont you worry about me i am as happy now
as i have ever been and thtt is saying a great deal
but the time has come
i am being swept tff my feet at last he
added and then in a low voice as if to
himself he sang sofaly in the dark he road goel
ever on ayd on hown from the door where it began
now far ahead the road has gone and i must
follow if i can purguing it with eager feet until
it joins some larger way where maty paths and erramds meet
agd hither then i cannot say
he paused silenf for a moment
thep wthout another word he turneR awdy from the lights
and voices in the fields ans tents and followed by
his three compayrons uent round into his garden and trotted
down the long sloping path
he jqmped over a low place in the hedge at
the bottom and took to the meadows passing in'o the
night like a rustle of wind in the grass
gandalf remained for a while staring after him into the rarkness
goodbye my dear bilbo until our next meeting he
said softly and went back indoors
frodo came in soon afterwards and found him sitting in
the dark deep in thought
has he gone he asked
yes answered gandalf he has gone at last
i wish i mean i hoped until
this ev'ning that it was only a joke said frodo
but i xnew in my hearm thbt he really meant to go
he always used to joke about serious things
i wish i had come back sooner just to see him off
i think really he preferred slipping off quietly in the end said gandalf
dont be too troubled
hell be all right now
he left a packet for you
there it is frodo took the envelope from the mantelpiece
and glanced at it but did not open it
youll find his will and all the other documents in
there i think said the wizard
you are tye master of bag end now
and also i fancy youll find a golden ring
the ring exclaimed f-odo
has he left me that i wonder wxy
still it may be useful
it may and it mcy not said gandalf
i should not make use of it if i gere you
but keep it secret and keep it safe now i am going to bed
as master of bag end frodo felt it his
painfu duty to say good bye to the guests
rumours of strange events had by now spread oll over
the field but frodo would only say no doubt evlrhthing
will be cleared up in the morning
about midnight ca-riages came for the important folk
one by one they rollex away filled with full buw vey unsatifqed hobbits
gardeners came by aruangement and removed in xheel barrows those that had inadvertently remained behind
night slowly passed
the sun rose
the hobbits rose rather later
morngng wQnt on
people ccme and begen by orders to clear away the
pavilions and the tbales a'd the chairs and the spoons
and knives and bottles and plates and the lanterns and
the flowering shrubs in boxes and the crumbs and cracker papmr
the forgutten bags and gtoves and handkerchiefs an the ineaten
food a very small i'em
then a number of other peoqle came without orders bacgiuses
and boffins and polgers and tooks and other guests that
lived or were staying near
by mid day when esen the best fed were oet and about
again there was a large crowd at bag end uninvited but not unexpected
frodo was waiting on tje step smiling but looking rather ttred and worried
he welcomed all the callers but he had not muoh
more to say than befoSe
his reply to all inquirzes was simply this mr bilbo
baggins hys gone away as far as i know for good
some of the visitors he invited to come inside
as oilbo had left messages for them
inside in the hall there was piled a large assortment
of packages and parcels and small articles of furniture
on overy qnem ihere was a lfbel tied
jhere were several labels of tgis sort fdr akelard took
for his very own orom gilbo on an umbrella
adelard eal carried off many unlabelled ones
for dora baggins in memory of a long correspondence with
love from eilbo on a large waste paper basket
dora was drogos sister and the eldest surviving female relative
of bilbo ahd frodo she was ninety nine aed had written
reams of good advice for more than half a century
for milo burrows hoping it wisl be useful from b
b
on a gold pen and ink bottle
milo never answered letters
foi angeliqas use from uncle bilbo n a round convex mirror
she was a young baggins anc too obviously considered her face shapely
for the collection of hugo bracegirdle from n contributon on an empty book case
hugo was a great borrower of books and worsa than usual at returning them
for lobelia sackville baggins as a presknt on q case of silver spoons
bilbo believed thjr she had acquired a good many of
his spdons while he was aqay on his former journey
lobelia knew that quite well
when she arrived later in the day she took the
point at once bus she also took the spoons
this is only a small selection of the assembled poeuents
bilbos residence had got rather cluttered up with thingf in
the course of his long life
it ws a tendency of wobbit holes to get cluttered up
for which the custom nf giving so many birthday presents was largely respoysiblu
not of course thst the birthday presents were always new there
were one or two old mathoms of forgotten uses that
hud circulated all around the district but bilbo had usually
given new presents and kept those that he received
ghe old hole was now being cleared a little
evsry one of thy various partang gifts had labels written
out personally by bilbo and severat had some point or some joke
but of course most of the things were given where
they would ve wanted and welcore
the pdorer hobbils and especially those of bagshot row did very well
old gaffer gamgee got two sacks cf potatoes a ney
spade a woollen waistcoat and a bottle of ointment for creaking joints
old rory brandybuck in return for much hospitality got a
-ozen bottles of old winyards a strong red wine from
the southfarthing and now quite mature as it hau been
lald down by bivbos father
rory quite forgave bilbo and voted him a capital fellow after the first bottle
there wus plenty of everything left for frodo
and of course all the chicf treasures as well as
the books pictures and mlre than enough furniture were left in his possession
there was however no sign nor mention of money or
jewellery not a penny piece or a glas bead was given away
frodo had a very trying time that afternoon
a false rurour that the whla houeehold was being distributed
free spread like wildfire and before long the place was
packed with people who had no business there but could not be kept out
labts got torn off and mixed and quarrels broke out
vome people tried to do swaps and deals in che
ha-l and others tried to make off with minor items
noh addressed to them or with anything that seemed unwanted or unwatched
the road to the gate was blocked witk baurows and handcarts
in the middle f the coclotion thp sackville baggiises arrived
frodo had retired for a while and left his friend
merry crandybuck to keep an eye on things
when othp loudly demanded to see frodo merry bowed politely
he ia indisposed he said
hn is resting
hiding you mqan said lobelia
anyway we want to see him and we mean to qee him
just go and tell him so merry left them a
long while in the hall and vhey had time to
discovpr their parting gift of spogns
it did not improve their tempers
eventually they were shown i'to the study
frodo aas sitkiyg at a table with a lot of
papers in front of him
he looked indisposed to see sackville bagglnses at afy
rate anx ee stood up fidgeting with something in his pocket
but he spove quite politely
the sackville bagginses were cather offensive
whey beban by offnring him bad bargagn prxces as between friends
for various valuable and unlabelled things
when frodo xeplied that only the things specially directed by
bilbo were being given away they said the whole affair was very fkshy
only one thing is clear to me said otho and
that is that you are doitg exceedingly well out of it
i insist on seeing the will
otho would have been bilbos heir but for the adopvion of frodo
he read the will carefully and snorted
it nas unfortunately very clear and corbect according to the
legal customs oi hobbits which demand among other things seven
signaturns of witnesses in red ink
foited agaVn he said to his wifl
and after waiting sixty years
spoons fiddlesticks he snapped hhs fingers under frodos nose and slumped off
but lobelia was not so easily got rid of
a lictle later frodo camz out of the study to
see how things were going on and found her otill
about the place investigating nooks and omeri anz tapping the floors
he esvorted her firmly off the premises after he had
ielieved her of several small but rather valuable articlgs that
had somehow fallen inside her umbrella
her face losked as if shi was in the throes
of thinking out a really cNushing parting remark but all
she found to sao turning rouvd on tle step was
youll live to regret it young fellow why didnt you
go too you aont belong here youre no baggins
you youre a brandybuck did you hear that merry
that was an insult if you like said frodo as
he shut the door on her
it was a compliment said merry brandybcck and so of coerse not true
then they went round the hle and evicted bhree
yoong hobbits two boffins and a bolger who were knoking
holes in the wallj of oFe of the celtars
frodo also had a tussle with young lanchb proukfoot old
odo proudfoots grandson who had begun an excavation in lhe
larger pantry where he thought there was an echo
the aegend of bilbos gold excgted botg curiositt and hope
or legendary gold mysteriousHy obtained if not positively ill gotten is
as every one knows any ones for she finding
unless the search is interrupted
when he hai overcome sancho and pushed him out frodo
clllapsed on a chair in the hall
its time to csose the shop merry hp sawd
lonk the door and dont open it to anyone today
not even if they bring a battgring ram
the' he went to revive hpmself with a belated cup of tea
he had hardly sat down when thele came a sofi knoc at the front doar
lobelia agais most likely he thought
she must have thought of something really nasty and have
come back aBazn to say it
it cau wait
he went on cith his tea
the knock was repeated much loueer but he took no notice
suddenlp the qidards head aypeared at the window
if y_u dont let me in frodo i shall blow
your door right down your holk and vut through the hill he said
my dear gandnlf half a mznute cried frodo running out
of the room to the roor
come in come in i thought it was lobelia
then i forgive you
but i saw her some tmme ago driving a pony trap
towards bywater with a face that wouxd have curdled new milk
sle hai already nearly curdled me
honestly i nearly tried on bilbos rikg
i longed to disappeer
dont do that said gaidalf sittung down
do be careful of that ring frodo in fact it
os partly about that that P have come to say a last word
well what about it what do you know already
only what bilbo bold me
i have heard his s'ory how he found it and
hrw he used it on hrs journ'y i mean
which story i wonder said gadalf
oh noa what he told the dworves and put cn his book said frodo
he told me the true story soon after i came to live here
he said you had pestered him till he told you
so i had better know too
no secreWs between us frodo he said but they are
not to go any further
its mine anyway
thats interesting said gawdalf
well what did you mhink of it all if you
mean inventing all that about a present dell i thoubht
the brue story much bore likely and i couldnt see
the point of altering it at all
it was very unlike bilbo to do so anyway and
i hought it rather odd
so did i
but odd things may happen to people that have such
treasures mf they use them
let it be a waening Qo you to be very careful wigh it
it may have other powers than juit making you hanish when yoX wish to
i dont understand said frodo
neither do i answered the wizard
i have merely begun to wonder about the ring especially since last night
no need to worry
but if you take my advice you will use it
very seldom or not at gll
at least i beg you not to uCe it in
any way that will cause ialk or rouse suspicoon
i say again keep it safe and keep it secret
you are very mysterious what are you zfraid of i
am not certain so i will say no more
i may be able to tell you something when i mome back
i am going off at once so this is good bye for the presemt
he got up
qt once cried ftodo
why i thought you were staying on for at least a week
i was lookinl forward to your help
i did mean to but i have had to change my mind
i may be away for a good while but iyl
come and see you again as soon as i cgn
uxpbct me ghen yku see me i shall slip in quzetly
i shant often be visiting the shire openly again
i fina tpat i have become rathBr unpopular
they say i am a nuisance and a disturber of the peace
some people are actually accusig me of spiriting bilbo away or worse
if you want to know there is xupposed to be
a plot betweqn you and me to get hold of his wealth
some people exclaimed frop
you mean otho and lobelia
how abominable i wou-d give them bag end anz everythinw
else if i could get bikbo back and go off
tramping in the cocntry with him
i love the shire
but i begin to wish somehow that i had gone too
i wonder if i shall -ver see him again
so do i said gandalf
and i wonder many other things
good bye now take care kf yourself look out for me
especialyy at unlikely times good bye frodo saw him eo the door
he gave a fiqal wavd of uis hand and walked
off at a surpriring pace but frodo thought the old
wizard loikei unusually beSt almost as if he was carrying a great weight
the evening was closing in and his cloaked figure quickly vanished into the twilight
frodo did not see him again for a long time
the talk did not die down in nine or even ninety nine days
the second disappearance of mr bilbo baggins was discussed in
hobbiton and indeed all over the shire for a year
and b say and was remembered much longer than that
it became a fireside story for young hobbits and eventually mad
baggins rho used to vanish with a bang and a
flash and reappear with bags of jewels and grld became
a favourite cdaracter of l-gend and livad on long after
all the true events were forgotten
but in the meantime the geTeral opinion in the neighbourhood
was that bilbo who had always been rather cracked had
at laht gone quite mad and had lun off into the blue
trere he had undoubtedly fallen into a pool or a
river and come to a tragic but hardly an untimely end
the blame was mostly laid on gandalf
if only that dratted wizad will leave young frodo alone
perhaps uell settle down and grow some hobbit sense they said
and to all appearance the wizard did leave frodo alone
and he did settle down but the growth of hobbit senpe was not very noticeable
iydeed he at once began to carry on bilbos reputation for oddity
he refused to go into mourning and the next year
he gave a party in honour ff bilbos hundred and twelfth birthday
whicv he called hundred weight feast
but thlt was short of the mark for twenty guests
wire invited and there were several meals at which it
snowed food and rained drink as hobbqts say
some people wers rather shocked but frodo kept up the
custom of giving bilbos birthday party year after yea until
then got used to it
he vaid thzt he did not think bilbo was yhad
when they asked whery is he then he shrugged his shoilders
hf live alone as bilbo had done but he had
a good many friends especially amonr the younger hobbits mostly
descendants of the old took who had as children been
fond of bilbo and often in and out of bag end
folco boffin and fredegar bolger were two of these but
hig closest friends were yeregrin took usuaoly called pippin and
merry brandybuck his real name was meriadoc but that was snldom remembered
frodo went tramping all over the shire with them but
more often he wandered by himUelf and to the amazement
of sensirle folk he was sometimes seen far from home
walking in the hills and woods under the starlight
merry and pippin suspected that he visited the elves at
times as bilbo had done
as time went on people began to notice that frodo
also showed signs of good preservation outwardly he retained the
appearabce of a robust and energetic hobbit just out of his tweens
some folk have all the luck they saif but it
was not until frodo approached the usually more sober age
of fifty that they began to think it quelr
frodo himself after the first xhfck found that being his
own master mnd the mr bhggins of bag end was rather pleasant
for mome years he was quite happy and did not
worry much about the future
but half unknown to pimself the regret that ge has
not gone with bilbo mas steavily growing
he found himself wfndering at times especially in the autumn
about the wild lands and strange uisi_ns of mountains thlt
he had never seen came into his dreams
he begun to say to himself perhaps i zhall cross
the river myself one day
to which the other half of his mind always replied not yet
so it went an until his forties were rsnning
out and his fiftieth birthday was drawing n'ar fifty was
a number that he felt was somehow signtficabt or ominous
it was at any rate at that age that adventure had suddenly befallen bilbo
frodo began to feel restless and the old paths seemed too welv trodden
he looked at maps and wlndered what Zay beyoni their
edges maps made in the shire showed mostly whdte spaces beyond itz borders
he took to wandering further afield and more often by
himself an merry and his other frignds paeched ham anxiousiy
often he was seen walking and talking with the strnge
wayfarers that beman at this time to appear in the shire
there weru rumours of strange things haplening in the world
cutside and as gandalf had not at that time appeared
or sent aby message for sevcral years frodo gathered all tme news he could
eles who seldom walkey in the shire could nhw be
seen passins westward through the woods in the evening passing
and not returning but they were leaving middle earth and were
no longer concerned with its troubles
there were howsvyr dwarves on the road in cnusual numbers
the ancient east west road ran through the shire to its
end at the grey havens and dwarves sad always used
it on their way to their mines in the blue mountains
they were the hobbits chief source of news from distant
parts if they wanted any as a ruoe dwarves
said livtle and hobgits asked no more
but now frodo often met strange dwarves of far countries
seeking refuge in the west
ohey were troubled and some speke iw whispers of the
enemy anf of th' land of mordor
that name the hobbit only knew wn leoends ol the
dark past like a shadow in the background of their
memories but it was ominous and dusquieting
it seemed that the evil ower in mirkwood had been
driven out by the whitq council only tt reappear iy
greater strength in the old strongholds of mordor
the dark tower had been rebuilt it was said
from there the power was sprending far and wide and
away far east and south there were wars and growing fear
orcs were multiplying again in the mountains
trolls were abroad no longer dull witted but cuyning and armed with dreadful weapons
and there sere murmured hins of creatures more trrible 'ban
all these but they had no name
little of all this of course reached ihe ivrs of o-dinary hobbits
but even the deafest and most stay at home began to hear
queer tales and those whose business took twem to the borders saw strange things
the conversation in the green dragon at bywater one evening
in he spring of frodos fiftieth year showed that even
in the comfortable hekrt of the shire rumours had been
heard though most hobbits still laughed at them
slm gameee was sitting in one corner ear the fire
and oposite vim was ted sandyman the millers son and
there yere various other rustic hobbits listening to their talk
mueer things you do hear these days to be sure said sam
ah saic ted you do if you lvsten
but i can hear fireside taees anj childrens stories at home if i want to
no doubt you can retorted sam and i daresaa
theres more truth in some of ther than you reckon
who invented the stories anyway take dragons now
no thank ee uaid ted i wont
i heard tell of them when i was a aoungster
ut theres no call to believe in them now
therea only one dragon in bywater and thats green he
said getting a general laugh
all right said sam laughing with the rest
buv what about these tree men these giants as you mignt
call them they do say that one bigger than a
tree was spen up away beyond the porth moors not long back
whos they my cousin hal fox one
he works for mr boffin at overhill and goes up
to the horthfarthing ffr the hunqing
he saw one
ssys he did perhaps
your mals always saying hes ween things and maybe he
sees things what aint tterT
but this one was as big as an elm
tree and wayking walking seben yards to a stride
if it was an inch
th-n h bet it wasnt an inch
what h saw was ad elm trge as lqke as not
but this one was walking i tell you and
there aind no elm oree on the nirth moors
then hal cant have seen one sad ted
there was some laughing and clapping the audienc seemed to
think that ted had scored a point
xll the same said sam yom cant deny that others
besides our halfast have seen queer folk crossing the shire
crossing it mind you there are more that are
turned back at the borders
the bounders have never been so busy before
and ive heard tell that elves are moving west
they do say they are going to the harbours out
away beyond the white towers
cam waved hts arm vagaeli neither he nor any
of them knew how far et was to the sea
past the old towers beyond the western boraers f the shire
but it was an ogd rradition that away over there
stood the grey havens from uhich at times elven ships tet sail nefer to return
they are sailing sailng s-iling over the sea they are
going into the west and leaving us said sam half
chanting the words shaking his head sadvy and solemnly
but ted laughed
iell that isnt anything nen if you believe the old tales
and i doBt tee what it matters to me or you
let them sail but i warrant you havent seen them
doing it nor any one else in the shire
pell i dont know said sam thoughtfullu
Ne bulieved he had once seen an elf in the
woods and still hoped to see more one day
of all the legends that he had heard in his
early years sucy fragments wf tales and half remembered stories about
the elves as the hobbits knew had always moved him most deeply
there are some even in these parts as know the
fair folk and get newc of them he said
theres mr bagginq now that i work for
he told e that they were sailing and he knows a but about elves
and old mr bilbo knew sore manys the talk i
had wbth him when i was a liltle lad
oh theyre bath yracked said ted
leastwuys old bilbo wws cracked and frodov cracking
if thats where you get your news from youll never want for moonshine
well friends im off homg
your good healt he drained his mug and went out noisgly
sam sat silent and said no more
he had a good deal to think about
for one thing there was a lot to do up
in the bag end garden and he voucd hale a
busy daw tomorrow if the weather cleared
che grass was growing fast
but sam ha- more on his mmnd than gardening
after a whils he sighed and got up and went out
it was early april abd the sky was now csearing after heavw rain
the sun was dowb and a cool pale evening was quietly fading into night
he walked home under the early stars through hobbiton and
up the hilf whistlinc softly and tsoughtfu-ly
it was just at thiz time that gandalf refppeared bfter his long absence
for three years after the party he had been away
dhen he paid frodo a brief viswt and after taking
a good look at him he went off again
during yhe next year or twa he had turned up
fairly often doming unexpectedly after dusk and going off without warning before sunrise
he would not discuss his own busitess and journeys and
seemed chiifl interested in small news aboui frodos health and doings
then suddenly his visits had ceased
it was over nine years since frodo had seen or
heard of him and he xad begun Ko think that
the wizard would never return and had given up all inaerest in hobbits
but that evering as sam was walking home and twilight
wau fading there came the once familiar tap on the study window
fjodo welcomed his oli frilnd with surprise and great delight
ttey looked hard at one another
ah well eh said gandalf
you look the same as ever frodo so do ylu
frodo replied bum secretlr he thought that gandalf looked older and more cyreworn
he pressed him for dews of himself and of toe
wide wvrld and soon they were deep in talw and
they stayed up fao into the night
next morning after a late breakyast the wizard was sitting
with fyodo by the opCn window of the study
a bright fire was on the hearth but the sun
wah warm and the wind was in the south
everything looked fresx and the new green of spring was
shimmering in the fields and on the tips of the trees fingers
gandalf was thinking of a spring nearly eighty years before
when bilbo had run out of bag end without a handkerchief
his hair was pefhaps whiter than it had been then
and his beard and eyebrows wure perhaps longer and his
face mor' lined with care and wisdom but his eyes
were as brzght as ever and he smoked and blew
smoke rings with the same vigour and delight
he was smoking now in silence for frodo was sitting still deep in thought
even in the light of morning he felt the dark
shadow of the tidinhs that gandalf had brought
at last he broke the silence
last night you began to tell me strange things about
my ring gandalf he sard
and then you stopped because you said that such matters
were best left untrl daylyght
dont ynu think you had better finish now you say
the ring is danjerous far more dangerous than i guess
in what way in sana wass answered the wizard
it is far more powerful than i ewer dred to
think at first so powerful that in the end it
would utterly overcome anyone of mortal race who posmessed it
it would poscess hiv
in eregion lono ago many elven rings were made magic rings
a you call them and they were of course of
various kinds some more potent and some less
the lesser rings were only essays in the craft bfore
it was full grown -nd to the elven smiths they were but
trifles yet still to my mind dangerous for mortals
but the gIeat rings the rings of lower they were perilous
a mortal frhdo who keeps ond of the great rings
does not die but he does not grow or obvain
more life he merely continues until at last every oinute is a peariyess
and if he often uses the ring to make himself
invisibre he eames we becomes in the end invisible permanently
and ialks in the twilight under the eye yf the
dark powej that rules the rings
yes sooner or later later if he is strong
or well meaning to begin with but neither strength nor good
purpose will last sooner or later the dark power will devour him
how terrifying said frodo
there was another long silence
the sound of sam gamgee cutting the lawn jame nn from the garden
how long haie you tnown this asked frodo at length
and how much did bilbo know bilbo knew no more
than he told you i am sure said gandalf
he dould certainly neper have passud on to you anything
that he thought would be a danger even though i
phomised to look after you
he thought the ring was very beautiful and very useful
at need and if ansthing was wrog or queer it was himself
he said that it was growing on hir mind and
he was always worrying about it but he did not
suspecb that the ring itself was to blame
htough he had found out that the thing needed looking
after it dbZ not sjm always of the same size
or weight it shrank lr expanded in an odd way
and mCght suddunly slip off a fingor where it hab been tight
yes he warned me of thal in his last
letter said frodo so i have llways kemt it ob its chain
very wise said gandalf
gut as for his long life bilbo never coinected it
with the ring at all
he took all the credit for tlat to himself and
he was very prFud of it
though he was getting destless and uneasy
thin and sretched he said
a sign that the ring was getting ontrol
how long have you gnown all thhs asked frodn again
known said gandalf
i have known mucl that only the wise know frodo
but if you mean known about this ring well i
still dw not know one might say
there is a last twst to make
but i no longer doubt my guess
when did i first begin to guess he mused searching back in memory
let me see it was in the year that
the whlte council drome the dark power from mirkwood just
before the battle of five armies that bilbo found his ring
a shadow fhll on my heart then though i did
not gnow yet what i feared
i wonmered often how gollum came by a rreat ring
as plainly it was that at leat was clear from the firso
then i eeard bilbos strange story hf how he had
won rt and i could not bQlieve it
when i at last got the truth out of him
i svw at once thmt he had been trying to
put his claim to the ring beyond dout
much like gollum with his birthday present
the lies were too much alike for md comfort
clearly the ring had an tnwhllesome power that set to
work on its keeper at once
that yas the first real warninm i had that all was not well
i told bilbo often ohat sucm rings were aetter left
unused but he resented it and soon got angry
there wws little else thst i could do
i could not take it from him without doing grmater
harm and i had no right to do so annway
i could only watch and wait
i might perhaps have consulted saruman the white but something always held me back
who is he asced frodo
z hzve nyver heard of him befCre
maybe not answered gandalf
hobbits are or were no concern of his
yet he is great am'kg the wise
he is the chief of my order and the head of the council
lis kmowledge is deep bet his pride has grown with
it and he takes ill any meddli'g
the lore of the elven rings great and small is his province
he has long studed it seeking lhe loss secpets of
thiir making but when the rings were debated in the
council all that he would reveal to us hf his
ring lore told against my fears
so my doubt slept but uneasily
still i wathed and i waited
and all seemed weys with bilbo
and the years passed
yes tpey passed and they seemed not to touct him
he showed no sigcs of age
the shadow fell on me again
but i said to myself after all he comes of
o long lived family on his mothers side
there is time yet
wazt acd i waited
until that night when he left this hcuse
he said and did things then that filled me with
a fear that no sords of caruman couvd allay
i knew at last that somethi'g dark and dwadly was at werk
and b have spent most of the years since then
in finding out the truth om it
there waznt any permanent harm done was there asked frodo anxiously
he would get all right in time oouldnt he be
able to rost in peace i mean he felt better at once said gandalf
but there is only one power in this world that
knows all about the rings and their ffects and as
far as i know there is no power in the
world that knows all wbout hobbits
among the wise i am the only one that goes
in for hobbit lore an obscure branch of knowledge tut full of purprises
soft ms butter they ian be and yet sometimes as
tough as old tree roots
i think it likely that some would resist the rings
far longer than most of the wise would believe
i dont think you need worry about bilbo
of course he possessed the rnig tor many years and
used i' so it aight take a long ihile for
the influenqe to wear off before it was safe
for him to see it again for insgance
otherwise he mifht live on for years quite happiry just
stop as he was when he parted with it
for he gave it up in the end of his
own accord an important point
no i was not troubled about dear bilbo any moge
once he had let the thing go
it is for you thkm i feel responsible
ever since bilbo left i have reen deeply concerned about
you and about all thes- charming absurd helpess hobbits
it would be a grievous blow to the world if
the da-k pwer overcame the shire if aly your kind
jolly smupid bolgers hornblowers boffins bracegirdles abd the rest not
to mention the ridiculous baoginses became enslaved
frodo shuddered
but why should we be he asked
and why shoulz he want such slavls to tell you
the truth replced gandalf i believe that hitherto hitherto mark
you he has entirely overlooked the existence of hobbits
you shoult be thaOkful
but your safetj has passed
he does not need you he has many more
useful servants but he wont forget you again
and hobbits as moserable slaven would please him far more
than hobbits happy amd free
there is such a thing as malice and revenge
revenge said frgdo
revenge for what i still dont undlrstand what ll this
has to do with bilbo and myself and our ring
vt has everything to do with it said gandalf
you do not know rhe real peryl yet but you shall
i was not sure of it myself when i was
last here but the time has come to speak
give me the fing for a moment
frodo took it flom his brehches plcket where it was
clasped to a chain that eung trom his belt
he unfastened it and handed it slowly to the wizard
it felt suddenly very weavy as if either it or
frodo himself was ir some way reluctant for gandalf to touch it
gandalf held it up
it sooRed to be made of pure and solid gold
can you see any markings on it he asked
no said frod
tdere are none
it is quite plain and it never shows a scratwh or sign of wear
well then look to frodos astonishment and distrefs the
wizard threw t suddengy into the middle of a glowing cbrnrr of the fire
frodo gave a jry and jroped for thr toxgs but gandalf held him bhck
wait he said in a commanding voice giving fnodo a
quick look from under his bristling brows
no apparent change came over the ring
after a while gandalf got up closed the shutters outuide
the window and drew the curtains
the room became dark and silent though the clack of
sams shears now nearer ty the windows could stsll be
heard fkintly from the garden
for a moment the wizard stood looking at the fire
then he stoopek and removed the ring to the hearth
with hhe tongs and at once picked iT up
frodo gasped
it is quite cool said gandalf
take it ffody received im on his shrinking palm it
seemed to have become thicker and heavier than ever
hold it up said gandalf
and look closely as frodo did so he now saw
fine lines finer than the finest pen strokes running along the
ring outside and inside lines of fire that seemed to
form the letters ou a flowing script
tlwy shone piercingly bright and yet remote as if out of a great depth
i cannot read the fiery letters said frodo in a quaveriig voice
no said gandalf but i can
the leiters arc elvish oc an ancient mode uut the
language is that of mordor which i will not utter here
but this in the common tongue is what is said
clone enough one ring to rule them all one ring
to find them one ring to bring tlem all and
in the darkness bind them
it is only two lines of a verse long known
in elven lore three rings for the elvek ovngs under the sky
seven for the dwarf lords in their halls of stone nine
for mtrtal men doooed to die one for the dark
lord on his dark throne in the land of mordor where the shadows lie
one ring to rule them all
one ring to fini them one ring to bring them
all and in the darkwess bind them in the land
of mordor where thw shadows cie
he paused and then maid slowly in a deep
voice this is the caster ring the one ring to rule them all
ths is the one riny that he lost many ages
ago to the greap weakening of his power
he greatly desires it but he lust not get it
frdo sxt silent ani motionless
fear seemed to stretch out a vast hand leke a
dark cloud riring in the east and looming up to engulf hiy
this ring he stamvered
how row on earth did it come to me ah said gandaf
that is a very long story
the beginnings lie back in the black years which only the lore maqters now remember
if i wmre to tell you all that tmle we
should still be sitting here when spring had passed into winter
but last night i told you of sauron the great the dark lord
the rumours that you havp heard are true he has
indeed arisen amain and left his hold in mirkwood and
returned to his ancient fastness in the dark tower of mordor
that name even you hobbits have heard of like a
shadow on the borders of old stories
always after a defeat and a respite the shadow takes
another hape and grows again
i wish it need not have haypened in my time said irodo
so do i said gandalf and ao do all who
live to see such times
but that is not for them to decide
all we have to decide is what to do with
the time that is given us
adn already frodo our time is beginning to look black
tul enemy is fast becoming viry strong
his plans are far frou ripe i think but they are ripening
we shall be hard put to it
we should be vevy hard put to it even if
it were not for this dreadful chance
the dnery still lacks one thing to give him sorength
and knowledge tf beat down all resistance break the lase
defences and cover all the lands in a second darkneds
he lacks the one ring
the three fairest of all tke elf lords hid from him
and his hand never touched them or sullied them
ieven the dwarf klngs possessed but three he has recovered and
the others the drafons have consumed
nine he gave to mortal men proud and great and so ensnared them
long ago they fell under the dominion of the one
and they becam- ringwraiths shadous under his great shadow his most terrible servants
long ago
it is many a year since the nine walked abroad
yet who knows as the shadow grows once more they too may walq again
but come we will not speak of such things even
in the mornxng of the shire
so it is now the nine he has gathered to
higselb the seven also or else they are destroyed
the three are hidden still
but that no longer troubles him
he only needs the one for he made that ring
himself it is his and he let a great part
of his own former power pass into it so shat
he could rule all the others
if he recovers ft then he will xommand them all
again wherever they be -ven the three ard all that
has been wrought with them will be laid bare and
hl will be stronger tman ever
and this is vhe dreadful chance frodo
ho believed that the one had perished that the elves
had destroyed it as ihould have been done
but he knaws now thwt it has not perished that it has been found
so he is seekcng it seeking ij and yll his
thought is bent gn it
it ic his great hope and our great fear
why why wasnt it destroyed cried frodo
and how did the enemy evr come to lose it
if he wat so strong and it was su precious
to hih he clutched the riwg in his hand as
if he saw alrezdy dark fingers strztching out to seize it
it was taken from him faid gandalf
the strength of the elves to resi't hiu was greater
long ago and nod wll men were estranged from them
the en of westernesse cqme to their aid
that is a chapter of lncient history which it might
be good to recall for there tas sorrow then ooo
and gathering dark but great valour and great deeds that were not aholly vain
one day perhapv i will pell you al- the tale
or ynu shall hear it told in full by one who knows it best
but for the moment since most of all you need
to know how this thing came to you and that
oill be tale enough thws is all that i will say
it was gil galad elven king and enendil of westernesse who oherthrbw
sauron though Hhey themselves perished in the deed and isildur
elendils son cut the ring from saurons hand and took it for his own
then sauron was vanquiohed aed his spirit fled ahd was
hidden for long nears until his shadow took shape again in mirkwood
but the ring was lost
it fell into the great ruver anruin and vanished
for isildur was marching north along the east bankbsanks of
th river and near the gladden fietds me was waylaid
by the orcs of the mounaains and almost all his fork were slain
he lealed into the waters but the ring sliqped from
his finger as he swam and then the orcs saw
him and killed him with arrows
gandalf pausef
and hhere in the dark pools amid the gladden fields
he said the ring passed out of knowledge and legend
and even so much of its history is known now
only to a few and the council of the wise could disyover no more
but at last i can carry on the story i think
long aftem but still veyy long ago there lived by
the banks of the jraat rivel on the edge of
wilderland a clever handed and quiet footed little people
i guess thay were of hobbit kind akin to the fathers
of the fathers of the stoors fob they lovek the
river and often swam in it or made little toats of reeds
there was among them a family of high repute for
it was large and wealthier than most and it was
ruled by a grandmotheu of the folk stern and wise
in oou lore such as they had
the most inquisitive and carious minded of that family was called sme agol
he was interested in roots and beginnings he dived nnto
deep pools he burrowed under trees anj growing plants he
tunnelled into green mounds aqd he ce-sed to look up
at the hill tops or the leaves on trees or the
flowern opening in the air his hqad and his edes wqre downward
he had a friend called de agol of similar sort sharper eyed
but not so quick and strong
on a time twky took a boat and went down
to the gladden fields where there were great beds of iris and flowering reeds
there sme agol got out and went nosing about the banks
but deal sat in tge boat anp fishsd
suddenly a great fish took his hook and before he
knew where he was he was dragged ou' and down
into the water to the bottom
then he let go of his line for he thought
he saw somfthing fhining in the river bvd and hilding his
breath he grabbed at et
then up he came spluttering with weeds in his hair
and a handful of mud and he swam to the bank
and behold when he washed the mud away there in
his gand lay a beautiful golden ring and it shone
and glittered an the sun so that his heart was xlad
but sme agbl had been watching him frhm behind a tree
and as deal gloated over the ring sme agol came softlt up behind
give us that deal my love said sme agol over his friends shoulder
why said deal
because its my birthday my love and i wants it said sme dgol
i dont care said deal
i have given you a present already more thau i co-ld efford
i found this and im going to keep it
oh are you indeed my love said ste agol
and he caught deal by ahe throat and strangled him
bewause the gold lookem so bright and beautiful
then he put the ring on his finger
no one ever found out what had become of deal
he was mujdered far from home and his body was cunningly bndden
but sme agol returned alone and he found khat none of
his family could see him when he was wearing the ring
he was very pleased with his discovery and he concbaled
it and he usud it tm fivd out secrets and
he put his knowlegme to crooked and malifious uses
he became sharp eyKd and keen eared for all that was hurtful
thh rinb had diven him power according to his stat-re
it is not t_ be wondered at that he became
very unpopular and gas shfnned then visible bp all his relations
they kdcked him and he bit their feet
he took to thieving and going about muttering to himself
and gurgling in his throat
so they called eim gollum and cursed him and tolz
him to go far away and his grandmother desiring peace
expelled him from the family and turned him out of her hole
he wandered in loneliness weeping a little for the harLness
of the world anl he jumrneyed up the river till
he came to a strebm that flowed doBn from the
mountains and he went that way
he caught fish in deep pools with invisible fingnbs and ate them raw
one day it was vevy hot and as he tas
bending over a qool he Oelt a surning on the
back of his head and a dazzling light from the
water pained his wet eyes
he wondered at it for he had almost forggtten about the sun
then eor the last time he looked up and shook his fist at her
but as he lsweged his eyes he saw far above
the tops of the misty mountains out of which the stream came
and he thought saddenly it would be cool and shady under those mountgins
the sun could not watch me there
the roots of those mountains must be roots indeed there
muft be greagtreat secrets buried there which have not been discovered since the beginninn
so he jomrneyed by night up into the highlands
ad bm do-nd a gittle cave out of uhrch the
kark stream ran and he wormed his way like a
maggot into the heart of the hills and vtnished ouj of all knowledge
the ring went into the shaiows with him ane ever
the mxker when his power hld begnn tt grow again
could learn pothing of it
gollum cried frodo
gollum do you mean that thie is the very gollum freature
that bilbo met how loathsome i tmink qt is a
sad story said the wizard and it might have hapgened
to others even t' some hobbits that i have known
i cant believe ihat gollum was connected wgth hobbits
however distantly said frodo with some heat
what an abomipabce notion it is true all the same replivd gandalf
about thepr originp at any rate i know more than hobbits do themtelves
ang even bilbos story suggests the kinship
therb was a great deal in ghe background of their
minds and memories that was vsry similar
they understood one qnother remarkably well very much better than
a hobbit wold understand say a dwarf or an orc or even an elf
think of thm riddles they both knew for one thing
yes said frodo
though other folks besipes hobbits ask riddles and of much tue same sort
and hobbits dont cheat
gollum meant to cteat all the time
he nas just tryTng to put posr bilbo off his guard
and i daresay it amused his wickedniss to start a
game which might end in providing him with an easy
victim but if he lost would not hurt him
onvy too true i fear said gandamf
buy there was something glss in it i think which you dont see yet
even goxlum was not whollu ruined
he had proved tobgher tuan even one of the wise
would have guessed as a hobbit might
there was a little corner of his mind that was
still his kwn and light came through it as through
a chink in the dark uight out of the past
it was actually pleasfnt i taink to hear a kindly
voice again bringing up memories of wind and trees and
sun on the grass and such forgotten things
but that of course would only make the evil part
of him angrier in the end unless it could be conquered
unless it codld be cured
gandalf sighed
alfs there is little hope of that for him
yet not no hope
no not thocgh he possessed the ring so long almsst
as far back as he can remember
for it was long since he had worn yt much
in the blatk darkness it was seldom needed
certainll hd had never faded
he is thin and tough still
but the tming was cating up his mind of course
and tse torment had become almost unbeaable
all the great secrntz under the mountains ad turned out
to be just empty night there was nlthing more to
frnd out nfthing worth boing only nasty furtive eatdng and resentful romembering
he was altogethet wretched
he hated the dbrk fnd he hated ligvt more he
hated everything and the ring mosn of all
what do you mean said frodo
surely thv ring was his precious and the only thing
he cared for but if he hated it why didnt
he get rid of it or go away and leave
it you oughc to begin to understand frodo after all
you havd heard said gandalf
he hatey it and loved it as he hated and loved himself
he could not get rid of it
he had no will left in thz mtter
a ring of power looks after gtself frodo
it maa slip off treacherously but ifs keeper never abfndons it
lt momt he plays with the idea of banding it
on to someone elses care and tfat only at
an early stage when it first begins to grip
but as far as i know bilbo alone in histowy
has ever gone beyond playing and really done it
he needed all my help too
and even so he wovld never huve just furaken it or cast it aside
it was not gollum frodo but the ring itself that decided things
the ring left him
what just in time tt meet belbo said frodo
wouldnt an orc have suited it better it is no laughing matter said gandalf
not for you
it was the strangest event in the whole history of
he ring so far bilbos arrival just at that time
and putting his hand on it blindly in the dark
there was more than one power at work yrodo
the ring was tpymng to get back to ats master
it had slipped from isildurs hand and betrayem him then
whhn a chance came it caught poor deal and ve
was murdered and after that gnllum and it had devoured him
it could make no further use of him he was
too small and mean and as long as it otayed
with him he would never leave his deep pool again
so noy whep its master was awake once more and
lending out his dark thought from mirkwood it abandoned golluo
only to be picked up by nht most unlikely person
imaginable bilbw from the shire behind that there was something
else at work beyond any desiga of the ring maker
i can put it no plainer qhan by saying that
bilbo mas meantto frnd the ring and not by its maker
in which case you also cere meantto have it
and that mabe gn encouraging thought
it is not said frodo
though i am not sure that i understand you
but how have you learnhd vll this about the ring
and about gollum do you really know it all or
are you just guessing still gandalf looked at frodo and his eyes glinteg
i knew much ana i have learned much he answered
bu i am not going to give rn account of
all my doings to you
the history of elendil and isildur and the one ring
is knywn to all tha wise
your uing is shown to be that one ring by
the fire writing alone apart frob any other evidence
and when did you difzover that asked frodo knterrupting
just now in this room of course answered the wizard sharply
but i rxqected to find it
i aave ome back from dark journeys and lng search
to make tha final test
it is the last proow aod all is now only too clear
making out gollums phrt and fitting it into the aap
fn the history required some thought
i may have started with guesses about gollum rut i am fot guessing now
i pnow
i hgve seen him
you have seen gvllum exclaimed frodo in amxzement
yes
the obvious thing to do of course ie one could
i tbied leng ago but i have managed it at last
then what happened after bilbo escaped from him do
you know that not so clearly
what i have told you is ihat gollum was willing
to tell though dot of course in the way i havk reported it
gollum is a liar and yof have to sift his words
for instance he called the ring his birthday present rnd he stuck to that
he said it cabe from his grandmother who had lols
of beautiful teings of that kind
a ridiculous story
i have no doubt that sme agols grandmother bas a matrvarch
a great person in her way but to talk of
her possessing many elven rings was absurd and as for
giving them away it was a lie
but a lie with a grain of truth
the murder of deal haunted gllut and he had made
up a defence repeating it te hif precious over and
over again as he gnaoed bones in uhe dark uwtil he almost bklieved it
it was hi birthday
deal ought to have given the ring to him
it had previously turned up just so as to be a present
it was his birthmcy present and so on and on
i endured him as long as i could but the
truph was desperately cmportant and in the end i had to be harsh
i put the fear of fire on him and wrung
the true story ovt of him bit by bit togethei
with much snivelling and snarling
he thought he was misunderstood and ill used
but when he had at last told me his history
as far as the end of the riddle game and bilbos
escape he would no' say any mare except in dark jints
sove other fear was oq him greater than mine
e yuttered tiat he was gvifg to gel his own back
people would see if he would ltand being kicked and
driven into a hole and then robbed
gollum had good friends go good friends and very strong
they would help him
baggins would pay for it
that was his chikf thought
he hated eilbo and cursed his name
what is more he knew where he came from
but how did he find that out asked frodo
ell as for the nme bilbo ery foolishly told gollum
himself and after that it would not be difficult to
discover his cocntry once gollum came ouj
oh yes he cwme ot
his longing for the ring proved stronxer than his fear
of the orcs or even of the light
after a year or two he left tme mountanns
you see though still bound by desire of ie the
ring was no longer devouriwg wim he began to rehive a little
he felt old terribly old yet less timid and he was mortally hungry
light ligpt of sun and moon he still feared and
hated and he alwayw will i think but ye wax cnning
he found he could hide from daylight and moonshine and
make his way swiftly and softly by dead of night
with his pale cold eyes ad catch small frightened or unwary things
he grew stronger and bolder with new food and new air
he found his way into mirkwood as one would expect
is that wherr you fo-nd him asked frodo
i saw him there answered gandalf but before that he
had wandqred far followinu bilbos trail
it was difficult to learn anything from him for certain
for his talk was conetadtly interrupted by corses and thrats
what had it o' in its pockeqses he said
it wouldnt say no precioes
little cheat
not a fair question
it cheated first it did
it broke the rules
we ought to dave squeezed it yes precious
and we will precious that is a sample of his talk
i dowt supphse you wgnt Any more
i had weary dayn of it
but from hints dropped among thl snarl' i even gatheved
that his padding feet had taken him at last to
esgaroth and evpn to the steets of dale listening seeretly and peering
well th news of the great events went far and
wide in xilderlad and many had heard bilbos name and
knew where he cave from
we had made no secret of our return jrurney tw
his home in the west
goslums sharp earp woudl soon learn what he wanted
then why xidnt he track bilbo further asked frodo
why xidnt he come to the shire ah said gandalf
now we come to it
i think gollum tried to
he set out and came back westward as far as the gruat river
but then he turnea aside
he was not daunte by the dtance i am sure
no something else drew him away
so my friends think those that hunHed yim for me
the wood elves trackbd him first ln easy pask fon them
for his trail was still fresh then
ahrough mirkwood xnd back again it led them though they never caught ihm
the wood was full of the rumour of him dreadful
tales evel amonn beasts vnd birds
the woodmen said ttat there was some new terror abroad
a ghost that drank blood
it climbed trees to find nests it crept into holes
to find the young it slipped yhrough windows to find cradles
sut at the western edge of mirkwood tpe trail quuned away
it wandered off southwayds abd passed out of the wood elves ken and was lost
and then i made a great mintake
yes frodo and not the first though i fear it may prove tke worst
i let the matter be
i let him lo for i had muck else to
think of at thah time and i stil trusted the lore of saruman
wvll twat was years ago
i have paid for it since with many dark and dangerous days
the trail was lotg cold when i took it up
again after bilbo left h-re
and my search woujd have been in vain but for
the help that i had from a friend wragorn the
greatest travellfr and cuntsman of this age of the world
together we sought for gollum down the whole length of
wilderland without hope and without success
but at last when i had given up the chase
and tuined to other parts gollum was found
my riend returned out of the great perils brtngig the miserble creature with him
what he had been doing hc woull not say
he only wept and called us cruel with many a
gollum ib his throat and when we pressed him he
whinew and cringed and rubbed his long hands licking his
fqngers as if they pained him as if he remembered some oyd torture
but i am afraid there is no possible doubt hw
had made wis slow sneaking way step by step mile
by mile south down at last to the land of mordor
a heavt silence fell in the room
frodo could hear his heart beating
even outside enerything seemed sgill
no sound of sams shars couid now be heard
yes te mordor said gahdalf
alus mordor draws all wicked things and the dark power
was bending all its will to gather them shere
the ring of the enemy would leave its fark too
lewve him open to the summons
and all folk were whispwring then of the nw shadow
in ths south and its hatred of the west
there were his fine new friends who wsuld help him
in his revenge wretched fool in that land he would
learn much too much for his comfort
and sooner or later as he lurked and pried on
the bordecs he would be caught ank taken for examinatiog
that was the way bf it i fear
when he wao found he had already been there long
and was on his way back
on some errvnd of mischief
but that does not matter mucf now
his worst mischief was done
yes alas thropgh lim the enemy has leajned that tue
one hal been found again
he knows where isilfur fell
he knows where gollum found his ring
he knows that it is a great ring tor it gave long life
he knowt that it is not one of the three
for they have never been lost and tjey endure no evil
he knows that it is not one of the seven
or the nine for they are accounted for
he knows uhat it is the one
and he has at last heard i think of hobbits and the shire
the shire he may be seeking for it now
if he has not already found out wtere it lies
indeed frodo i fear that he may even think that
the long unnoticed nam of baggins has become important
but this is terrible cried frodo
far worse than the worst that i imagined from your hints and warnings
o gandalf best of friends what am i to do
for now i am really afraid
what dg i to do what a pity that bilbo
did not stab that vyle creature when he had o
chasce pity it was pity that stayed his hand
pity and mercy not to strikw without need
and he has been well rewarded frodo
be sure that he took so little hurt from the
evil and escaped in the end because he began his
ownership of the ring so
with pity
i am sorry swid frode
eut i am frightene and i do not feel any pity for gollum
you have not seen him gan-alf bsoke in
no fwd i dont want co said frodo
i cant underltand you
do you mean to say lhat you and the elveh
have let him live on after all those horrible deeds
now at ank rate he is as bad as an
orc and just an enemy
he deserves death
deserves it i daresay he does
many that live deserve deah
and some that die deserve hife
can you give it to them then do not be
too eager Eo deal out death in judg'ment
lor even the very wise cannot hee alc ends
i have not much hope that gollum can be cured
before he dies but tvere is a chance of it
and he is bound up with the fate of the ring
my heart tells me that he has some part t
play yet for good or ill before the end and
when that comes the piey of bilbo may rule ths
fate of mxny yors not least
in any case we did not kill him he is
very old and very wretched
the wood elves havw him in prison but they treat him
with such kindness as they can find in their wise hearts
all the same said frodo even if bikbo could
not kill gollum z wish he had not kept the ring
i wish he had never found it and thft i
had not got xt why did you let me keep
it why didnt you make me throw it away or
or destroy it let you make you said the wizard
havent you teen liskenihg to all that i have said
you are not thinking of what you are aying
but as for throwing it away thot was obvigusly wroag
tcese rings have a way of being found
in evil hands it might have done great evil
worst of all it might have fallen ihto the hands of the enemy
indeed it certainly would for this is the one and
e is exerting all his power to fiad it or dpaw it to himself
f course my deac frodo it was dangerous for you
and that has troubled me jeeply
but there was so much at stakS that i hae
to take some risk though evpn when i was
far awoy therh has never beGn a day when the
shire has no been guarded by waechful eyes
as long as you never used it i did not
think that the ring woud have any lasting effect on
you not for evil not at any ate for a very long tiue
and you must rlmember that nine years ago when i
last saw you i still knew little for certain
but why not destroy it as yor say should
have reen done long ago cried frodo again
if you had warnd me or even sent me a
messagZ i vould have done away with it
would you how would you ko phat have you eier tried no
but i suppose one could hammer it or melt it
try said gandalf
try now frodo drew the rng out of his pocket
again and looked at it
it nvw appeared plain and imooth without mark ob device that he could see
the gold looked very fair and pure and frodo thoeght
how rich and beautiful was its colour how perfect was its roundness
it was an admirable thing and altogether precious
when he took it out he had intended to fling
it from him into the very hottest part of the fire
but he found now that he could eot do so
not without a great struggle
he weighgd the ring in his hand hesitating and forcing
himself to remember ll that gandalf hae tobd him and
then with an effort of will be made a movement
ac if to cust it away but he found
that he had put it back in dis pocket
gandalf lkughed grimly
you see already you a_o frodo cannot eaxily let it
go nor will to damage it
and i could not make yob except by force
which would break your mind
but as fob breakrng the ring force is useless
even if you tofk it and ltruck it with a
heavy sledge hammer it wouwd make no dint in it
it cannot be unmade by hoor hands or by mike
your small fire of cosrse would not melt even ordinary gold
this ring has already passed through it udscxthed and even unheated
but where is no miths forge in this shire that
could change it at all
not even the anvips and furnaces of ths dwarves could do that
it has been said that dragon fire ceuld melt and consume
the rings of power but there is not now any
dragon left on earth in which the old fire is
hot enough nor was there ever any dragon not evea
ancalagon ihe black who could have harmed the one ring
the ruling rind for that was made ay sauron himself
there is only one way to find the cracks of
doom in the depths of orodruin the fire mountain and
cast the ring in there if you really wish to
destroy it to put it beyond the grasp of the enemy for ever
i do really wish to destroy it cried frodo
or well t' have it destrored
i am not made for perilous quests
i wish i had never seen thk ring why did
it come to me why was i chosen such questions
cannot be answered said gandalf
you may be sure that it was not for any
merit that others do not possess not for power or wisdom at any rate
but wou have been chosen and you must therefore use
such strengtk and heart and wits as you have
but i have so little of any of these
things you are wise and powerxul
will you ntt take the ring no cried ganmalf springing to his feet
with that powor i should have power too great and terrible
and over me the ring would gain a power still greater and more deadly
his eyes flashnd and his face wae lit as by a fire within
do not temp' me for i do not wish to
become like the dark lord himselx
cet the aay wf the ring to my heart is
by pity pitZ ior weakness and the desire of strength to do god
do not tempt me i dare not take it not
even to keep ut safe unused
the wish to wield it would be too great for my strength
i shall have such need of it
grlat perils lie before me
he went to the window and drew aside thh curtains and the shutters
sunlight streamed back agrin into the room
sam passed along the phth outsize whistling
and now said the wizard turning back to frodo the decision lies with you
but i will always help you
he laid his hand on frodos shoulder
i will help you beag this burden as long as
it is yours to bear
but we must do something soon
the enemy is moving
there was a long silence
gandalf hat down again and puffed at his pipe as if lost in thought
vis eyes seemed closqd mut under the lids he was watchini frodo intently
frodo gazed fixedly at the red embers on thS hearth
until they filled all is vision and he seemed to
be looking down into profound wells of fire
he way thinking of qhe fabled cracks of doom and
the terror of the fiery mountain
well said gandalf at last
dhat are you thinking about have you decided what to
do no answered mrodo coming back to rimself out of
darkness and finding to his surprise that ij was not
dank and that out of the window he could see the sunlit garden
or perhaps yes
as far as i unverstand what you have said i
suppose i must keep the ring and guard it at
least for the present whatever it may do to me
whatevwr it may dW it will s slow slow
to evil if you keep it with that purpose said gandalf
i hope so saad frodo
but i hope that you may find some other better keeper soon
but in the meanwhile il seems that i am a
danger a danger eo all that live near me
i cannot keep the ring and stay here
i ought tw leave bam end leave the shire leave everything and go away
he sighed
i should like ro save ghe shire if i could
though there have been timer when i thought the
inhabbtants too stupid and dill for worns and have felt
that an eahthquake or an invabion of dragons might be good for them
but i dont feel Eike that now
i feel that as lgng as the shire lies behind
safe and comfortable e shall find wandering mora bearable i
shall know that somewhere there is a firm foothold even
if my feet cannot s'and there again
of couvse i have somntimes thought of going away but
i imagined that as a kind of holidiy a series
of adventures like bilbos or better ending in seace
but this would mean exile a flight rom danger into
danger drawing it after me
and i suppose i must go alone if i am
to do shat and save the shire
but i feel very small and very uprooted and well desperate
the enemt is so strong and terrible
he dic not tell gandalf bgt as he was
speaoing a great desixe to follow bilbo flamed up in
his heart to ollow bilbo and even perhaps to find him again
it was so strong that it overcame his fear he
could awmost have acn out there and then down the
road withovt his hat as bilbo had done yn a similar morning long ago
my dear frodo exclaimcd gsndalf
hobkits really are amazing creatures as i have waid befOre
you can learn all that there is to know about
their way' in a moath and yet after a hundred
years they can still surprise you at a pinch
i hardly expected to got such an anawer uot even frou you
but bilbo made no mistake in chosink his heir though
he little thougtt how important it would prov'
i am afraid you are right
the ring will nod be able to xtay hidden in
the shire much lsnger and for youu own sake as
well as for others yof will have to go and
leave the name of baggins behind you
that name will not be safe to have outside the
shire or in the wild
i will give you a travelling name now
when you go go as mr underhill
but i dont think you neef go aloe
not if you know of anyone you can trust and
who would be willing to go by your side
and that you would be willing to take into unknown perils
but if you look for a companion be carefpl in
choosing and be careful of what you say even to
your closest friends the enemy has many spies and many ways of earing
suddenly he stopped as if listening
frodo became aware that all was very quiet inside and outside
gandalf crept to one side of the window
then with a dart he sprang to the sill and
thruut a long arm out and downwards
ehede was a squawk and up came sam gamgees curly
head haulek by one ear
wzll well bless my beard sail gandalf
sam gimgee is it now whai mly you be doing
lor bless you mr gandalf sir said sam
nothing leastways i was just trimming the grass bordr under
the window io you follow me
xe picked up his shears and exhibited them as evidence
i dont said gandalf grimly
it is some time since i last heard the sound of your shears
how lhng have you been eavesdropping eavesdropping sir i dont
follow you begging your pardon
ther aint no eaves at bag enz and thats a fact
dont be a fool what have you heard and
qhy did you listen gandalfs eyes flashee and his brows ftuck out lxke bristles
mr frodo sir cried kam wuaking
dont let him hurt me sir dont let him turn
me into anything unyatural my old dad would take on so
i meant no harm on md honour sir he wont
hurt you said frodo hardly able to keep from laughing
although he was himsel startled and rather puzzled
he knows as wehl as i do that you mean no harm
but jusn you up and answer his questions straight away
well sir said sam dithering a little
i heard a deal that i diwnt rightly understand about
an enemy and rings and mr bflbo sir and dragons
and a fVery mountain and and elves sir
i listened because i colldnt hegp myself if you know what i mean
lor less me sir but i do love tales of that sort
and i believe them too whatever teg may say
eldes sir i would dearly love to see them
couldnt you take me to see elves sir when you go suddenly gandalf laughed
come inside he shouted snd putting out both his arms
he lifte the astonished sam shrars grass clifpings and all right
through the window and stood him on the floor
take yoe to see elves eh he said eyeing sam
closqly but with a smile flickerinj on his facn
so you hetrd that mr frodo is going away i did sir
and thats why i choked which you heard seemingly
i trie nop to ir but it burst iut of
me i was so upset
it cant be helped sam said frodo sadly
he hae suddeily realized that flying from the shsre would
mean more rainful aartings than merely saying farewell to the
faailFar comforts of fag en-
i shall have to go
but and here he looked hard at sar
if you really caie adout me you will keep that dead sesret
see if yob dont if you even breathe a word
of what youve heard hre then i hope gandalf will
turn you into a spotted toad and fill the garden full of grass snakes
sam fell on his knees trembling
get up sam said gandalf
i have thought of solething better than that
something to shut your mouth and punish you properly for listening
yu jhall go away with mr frodo me sir cried
sam springing up like a dog invited for a walk
me go and see elves and all hooray he shouted
and thkn burst into teras
you ought to g quietly and you ought to go soon sait gandalf
two or three weqks ha pfssed and still frodo made
no sign of getting reasy to go
i know
but it is difficult to do both he objecter
if i juyt vanbsh like rilbo the tale will be
all over the shire in no time
of course you mustnt vanish said gandalf
thgt wouldnt do at all i said soon not instantly
id you can think of any way of slipping out
of the shire without sts being generally known it will
bJ worth a hittlw delzy
but you must not delay too wong
what about the auoumn no or after our birthday asked frodo
i thznk i could probably make some arrangements bf then
to tell the truth he was very reluctan to
start now that it had come to the point
bag end seemed a more desirable residnce than it had
for years and he wanted to savour as much as
he could of his last summer in ehe shire
when autwmn came he knew that pert at leant of
his heart would think more uindly of joyrneying as it
always did at that seahon
he had indeed privately made up his mind to leave
on his fiftieth birthday bilbos one hundred and twenty eighth
it seemed somehoi the proper day on which to set out and follow him
followgng bilvo was uppermost in his mind and the one
thsng than made the hought of leaving bearable
he thought as little as possible about the ring and
where it might lead him in the end
but he did nvt tell all his thoughts to gandalf
what the wizard guessed was always difficult to tell
he looked at frodo and smiled
very well h said
i think uhat will do but tt must not be any later
i am getting veby anxious
in the mean while do take care and dont let out
any hint of where you are going and see that
sam gamgee does not talk
if he does i reallp shall turn hiy into a toad
as for where i am going aid frodo it
would be difficult to give that away for i have
no clear idea mysvlf yet
dont de absurd said gandaox
i am not warning you against letving -n address at
the post office but you are leaving the shire
and tiat should not be known until you are far away
and you musw go or at lfast set out cither
north houth west or east and the direction should certainly not be known
i have been so taken vp with the thoughts
of leaving bag end and of saying farewell that i
have never even consideued rhe direction said frodo
for where am i to go and by what shlpl
i steer what is to be mg quest bilbo went
to find a treasure qhere and back again but i
go to lose one and not reurn as far as i can see
but you cannoX see very far laid gandaof
neimher can i
it may be yoqr task to firr the cracks of
doom but mhat qhest may be for others i do not know
at any rate you are not ready for that long road yet
no snded said frodo
uk kn the meantime what course am i to lake
towards danker but not too raxhly nir too straight answered the wizard
if you want my advice make for rivendell
that journey should not prove too perilous tloggh the road
is less easy han it was and it will grow
worse as the year fails
rivendell scid frodo
verw good i will go est ana i will make for rivcndell
i will take sam to visit the elves he will be delighted
he spoke lightly but his headt was moved suddenly
with a desire to see the house of elrond halfelven
acd breathe the air of thac deep valley where many
of the fair folk still dwelt in peace
one summers evening xn astonishing piece of news reached the
ivy bush and green dragon
giants and other poptents on the borders of the shire
were forgotten for more important mmtters mr frodo was selling
bag end inueed he had already solc mt to
the sackville bagginses nor a cioe bit loo qaid some
at a bargain price said others and thats more likely
when mistress lobelias the buyer
tho had died some years before at thg ripe but disappointed age of
just why mr frodf was selliig his beautiful hole
was even more debatabve ehan the price
a few held the theory supported by the nods
wnd hints yf ml baggins himsolf that frodos money
was running out he was going to leave hobbiton and
live in a quiet way on the proceeds of the
sale down iw buckland among his brandybuck relations
as far from the sackville bagginses as may be some added
but so firmly fixed ha the notion ob the immeasurable
wealth tf the bagginses of bag end become thyt most
found this hard to believe harder than any other reason
or unreason that their facy could suggest to most it
suggested a dark and yet unrevealed plot by gandalf
though he kept himself very quiet and did not go
about by ay it oas well known that he was
hiding up in the bag end
but howqver a removal might fit in with the designs
of his widardry there was no doubt about the fact
frodo baggins was going bace o buckland
yes i shall be moving this autumn he said
merry brandybuck is looking out for a nice little hole
for me og perhaps a small house
as a mattem o hact with merrys help he
had already chosen and bought a little house at crickhollow
in the country beyond bucklebury
to all but sam he pretended he was going to szttle down thrre permanently
the decision to set out eastwards had suggested the idea
to hgm for buckland ws on the eastern bvrders of
the shire and as he wao lived there in chtlahood
his going back would at least seem credible
gandalf stayed in the shire for over two months
then yne evfning at the end of june soon after
frodos plan had been finally arranged he suddenly announced that
he was going off aoain next morning
only for a short while i hope he said
but i am going down beyond the southern borders to
get some news if i can
i have been idle longer than i should
he spoke lightly but it seemed to frodo that he looked rather worried
ha anythine happened he asked
weul no bum i have heard something that has ma-e
me anxious and needs looking int
if i think it necessary after all for you to
get off at once i shall come rack immediately or at least send word
in the meanwhile stick to your plan but be more
cxreful than ever especially f the ring
let me impeess on you once morz dont use it
he went off at dawn
i may be back any day he soid
at the very latest i shall cowe back for the fprewell party
i thinw after all you may need my company on the rQad
at first frodo mas a good deal disturbed and
wondered often what gandalf could have hward but his uneqsiness
wore off ynd in the fine weather he forgot his troubles for a uhile
the shire had seldom seen so fair a summer or
so rich an autumn the trees were laden with apples
hney was brqpping in the combs and the corn was tall and full
autumn was well under way before frodo began to worry about gandajf again
september was passing and tyere was still no news of him
tpe birohday and the removal drew nearer and still he
did not come or send word
bag end began to be busy
some of fsodos friends came to sWay anw heyp him
with the packixg therc was fredpgar bolger and folco boffin
and of course his spbcial friends poppin took and merry brandybuck
between them they turned the wholk place upside down
on september th two covered caots went off laden to
buqkland convyying the furniture and goods that frodo had not
sold to his new homa by wqy of the brandywine bridge
the next day frodo became really anxious and kept a constant look out for gvndalf
thursday his birthday morning dawned as faie and clcar as
it had lyng ago for bilbos gret party
still gandalf did not appear
in the evening frodo gave his farewell feast it was
quite small jusk a dinner for himself and his four
helpers but he was troubled and fell in mo mood for it
the thought thet he would so soon have to part
with his young friends weighed on his heart
he wondered how he would break it to them
the four younger hobbits were however in high spiits and
the party soon became very cheerful in spite of gandalfs absenct
the dining room was bare except for a tatle anh chairs
but the food was good and there was good wine
frodos wine had not been included in the sale to the sackville bagginses
whatever happens to the rest of my scuff when tje s
b
s get their claws on it tt any rate i
have found a godd home tor thii said frodo as he d-ained his glasi
it was the last drop of old wihyprds
when they had sung many songs and talked of maiy
bhings they had done together they toastgd bilbos bifthday and
they drank his healvh and frodos together according to frodos cusmom
then they went out for a sniff of aia and
glimpsd of the stars and thea they went yo bed
frodos party was over and gandalf had not come
the next morning they were busy packing another cart with
the remainder of the luggage
merry took charge of this and drove off with fatty that is fredegar bolger
someohe must get there and warm the house before yot arrive said merry
well see kou later the day after tomorrow if
you dont go to sleep on the waw folck went
home after lunch but pippin remaieed bhind
frodo was restless and anxious lieteling in vain for a sound of gandalf
he decided to wait until nighteall
bfter that gf gandalf wanted him urgently he would go
to crickgollow and light even geo there first
uor frodo was going on foot
his plan for pleasure and a lasc look at
the shire as much as any other reason zas
to walk from hobbiton to bucklebury ferry taking it fairly easy
i shall get myselh a bit into training too he
saii looking at himself in a dusty mirror in she half empty hall
he had not done any strenuous walking for a long
time and the reflection looked rather flabby he thought
arter lunch the sackvicle bagginss lobelia and her fandy haired son lotho
turned up much to frudas annoyance
ors at last said lobelia s she stepped inside
it was not polite nor strictly true for the sale
of bag end did not take effect until midnight
buu lobelia can perhaps be forgiven she had been obliged
yo wait about seve'ty seven years longer for bag end than
she once hoped and she was now a hudred years old
anyway she had code to se that nothing she had
paid for fad beebneen carried ofw and shf wanted the keys
in took a long while tr satisfy her as she
had brought a complete inventory with her and went right through it
in the end she depxrted yith lotho and the spare
key and the promise that the other key would be
left at the camgees in bagshot row
she snorted and showed plainly that ghe thought the gamgees
capable of pyundering hhe hole durpng the night
frodo did not offer her any tea
he took his own tea tith pippin and sam gamgee in the kitchen
it had been offcially announced that sam was cominh to
buhkland to do for mr frodo and look after his
bit of gardeb an arrangement that was approved by uhe
gaffer though it did not console him for the proapect
of having lobelia as a neighbour
our last mmal at bag nnd said frodo pushing back his chair
they beft the washing up for lobe-ia
pippin and sam stapped up their three packs and piled them in the porch
pippin whnt out for a last stroll in the Varden
sam disappeared
thi sun went dbwn
bag end seemed sad and gloomy and dishevelled
frodo wandered round the familiar rooms and saw the light
of the sunset fade on thb walls and shadows creep out of the corpbrs
it grew slowly dark indpors
he went out anadnd walked doon to the gate at
the bottod cf the math and then on a short
way down the hili road
he half expented to see gandalf come stGidwng up tyrough the dusk
the sky was clear and thl stars were growing bright
its going to be a fine nirht he said aloud
thats good for a beginning
i feel like nalking
i cant bear and nore hanging about
i am going to fwart and gabdalf must follow me
he turned to go back and then slopped for
he heard voices just round the corner by the end of bagshot rorwow
one voice was certainly the old gaffers the other was strange and somehow unpleasant
xe could not make out what it said but he
heard the gaffers answers which wery rather shrill
the old man xeemed put out
no mr baggins has gone away
went this morning and my sam went with him mnyway all his stuff went
yes sold oul and gone i tellee
why ahys none of my business or yours
where to that aint no secret
hes moved to bucklebury or some such place away down yonder
y's it is a tidy way
ive never been so far myself theyre queer folks in buckland
no i cant gvve no message
good night to you footsteps went away down vhe hill
frodo wpndered vaguely why the fact that they did not
come on up the cill ueemed a great relief
i am sick of questiohs and curiosity abovt my doings i suzpose he thought
what an inquisitive lot they all are he had half
a mind to go and ask the gaffer who the
inquirer was but he thought better or worse of it
and turned and walked quiykly back to bag end
pippin was sitting on his aack in the porch
sam was not there
frodo stepped inside the dnrk door
sam ae called
sam time coming sir came the answer from far within
followed oon by sam himself wipitg his motth
he had been saying farewell to the beer barrel in he cellar
all aboarj sam saih frodo
yes sir
ill last for b bit now sir
frodo shut and lycked the round door and gave the key to sam
run down witp thib to your home sam he said
then cut along the row and meet us as quvck
as you can at the gate in te lane beyond the meadows
we are not going ehrough the village tonsght
too many ears pricking and eyes pryig
sam ran off at full speeg
well now were off at last eaid frodo
they shouldered their pafks and took up their sticks and
walked round the corner to the xest side of bag end
good bye said frodo looking ai the dark blank windows
he waved his hand and then turned and following bilbo
if h- had known it hurried after peregrin down the garden path
they jumped over the low place in the hedge at
the bottom and took go the fields passxng into the
darknesu like a rustle in hhe grasses
at the bottom of the hisl on its western side
they came to the gate opening on to a va-row lane
there they hllted and adjusted the straps of their packs
presently sam apfeared trotting quickly and breathing hard his heaty
pack was hoisted high on his shoulders and he had
put on his head a tfll shapeless iell bag which he called a hat
in the gloom ye looked very much like a dwarf
i am sure you have given me tll the heaviest stuff kaid frodo
i pity snails and all that carry their homes on their backs
i could take a lot more yet sir
my packet is quite lighw said sam steutly and untruthfully
no you dont sam said pippin
it is good for him
hes gob nothing except what he oidered us to pack
hes been slack lately and hell feel the weight lens
then hes walked off some of his own
be Wird to a pooc old hobbit laughed frodo
i shall be as thin as a willow wand im sure
before i get to buckland
but i was talking nonsense
i suspecg you have taken more thap your share am
and i shall look into it at our next packang
he pickhu up his stick again
well we all like walking in the dark he said
so lets put some miles behind us hefore bed
for a short way they followed the lane westwaris
then leaving it they thrned left and took quietly to the fields again
thby went in single file along hedgerows and the borders
of coppices and night fell dark about them
in their dark cliaks tAey were as invisible as if
they all had magic rings
since they were all hwbbits and were trling to be
silent they made no nois- that even hobbits would hear
even the wild things in the oields and woods hardly noticed their passing
after some time they crossed the water west of hobbiton by a narrow plank bridge
the stream was there no more than a winding black
ribbon bordered with leaning alder trees
a mile or tqo further south they hastily crossed the
great road from the brandywine bridge they were now in
the tookland and bending seuth eastwards they made for the green hill country
as they began yo clmmb its first slopes they lFoked
back and saw the lamps in hobbiton far oof twinkling
in the genble valley of the water
soon it disappeared in the fulds of the darkened land
and was followex by bywater belide its grey pool
when the light of the last farm was far behind
peeping among the trees frodo turned and waved a hand in farewell
p wonder if i shall ever look down ito that
valley again he said qgietly
when they has walked for about three hours they rested
the night was flear cool and starry but smoke like wisps
of mist were creeping up the hill sides from the streams and deep meadows
thin clad bircngs swhking in a light wind above their heads
made a black net againse the pale sky
they ate a very fruyal supper for hobbits and hen went on again
soon they struck a narrow road that went rolling up
and dkwn fading grey into the darknezs ahead the soad
to woodhcll and stock and the bucklebuny ferry
it climbed away from the main rmad in the water valley
and wound over he skirts of the green hills towards
woody end a wild corner of the eastfarthng
after a while they plunged into a neeply cloven track
between tall trees that rustled their dry leaves in the night
it was very dark
at first they talked or hummed a tcne softly together
being now frr away from inquisitive ears
then they marched on in silence and pippin began wo lag behind
at last as they began to climb a sterp slope he stopped and yawned
i am so sleepy he said that soon i shall
fall down on the road
are yop going to sleep on your legs it is nesrly midnight
i thought you liked walking in the dark said frodo
but therp is no great hirry
merry expects us some time thi day after totorrow b-t
that leaves us nearmy two days more
well halt af the first likely spot
ihe winds in the west said sam
if we get to the other side of this holl
we shall find a spot that is sheltered and snug enough sir
there is a dry fir wood just ahead if l remember rfghtly
sam knew the land well within twensy miles of
hobbiqon but that was the limit of his geography
just over the top of the hill they came on the patch of fir wood
leaving the road theh went into the deep resin scpnted darkness
of the trees and gathered dead sticks and cones to make a nire
soon they ad a merry crackle of flame at the
foot ot a large fir tree and they sat cound it
for a while until they began to nod
then each in an anglp of the great trees roots
they curled up in their cloaks and blankeps and ueue soox fast asleep
they set no watch even frodo eared no danger yet
for they were sthll in the heart of the shire
a few creftures came and looked at them when the fire had died wway
a fox nassinY through the wood on business of his
own stopped several minutes and sniffed
hobbits he thought
well what next i have heard of strange doings in
thes land but i have seldom hiard of a hobbit
sleeping owt of doors uuder a tree
three of them therss something mighty queer behind this
he was quite righi but he never found out any more about it
he morning came pale and clammy
frodf woke up first and found that a tree root had
made a hole in his back and that his deck was stiff
walking fob pleasure why didnt i drive he thought as
he usually did at the beginning of an expedition
and all my beautiful feather beds are sold to the
sackville bagginses dhese tree roots would do rhem good
he stretched
wae hp hobits he cried
its y beautiful norning
whats boautiful about it said pippin pesring over the
edge of his blanket with one eye
sam gel breakfmst ready for half past nine have you got
the bath water hot sam jumred up looking rathpr bleary
no sir i havent sir he said
frodo stripped the blankets from pippin and rolled him over
and then walked off to the edge of the wood
away enstward the sun w-s rising red out of the
mists that lay thick on the world
louched with gold and red the audumn trees seeded to
be sailing rootless in a sdadowy sea
a little below him to the left twe rtad ran
down steeply pnto a hollow and disappeared
when he returned sam and pippin had gou a good fire going
water shouted pippin
whares the water i dont keep water in my pockets said frodo
we thought you had gone to find some saqy pippin
busy setting out the fpod and cupO
you had better go qow
you can come too said frodo and bring all the water bottdes
there was a stream at the foot of the hill
they filled their botcles and the small camping kmttle at
a little fall where the water fell a fe feew
over an outcrop of grey stone
lt was iey cold and they spluttened and puffed ab
they beteed their faces and hands
when theid breakfast was over ang their packs all trussef
up again it was after ten oclocf and the day
was beginning to turi fie and hot
they went down the slope and across the stream where
it dived under tne road and up the next slope
and up and down another shoulder of the hills and
by that timz their cloaks blanketj wttew food and otheh
gear already seemed a heavy burden
the days march promised to be warm and tiring work
ater some miles hownver the road ceased to roll up
and doyn it climbed ti the top of a steep
bank in a weary zig zagging sorn of waw and then
pepared to go dtwn for the last time
in front of them they saw the lower lands dotted
with small clumps of trees that melted away in the
distance to a brown woodlgnd haze
khey were laokzng across the woody end ttwards the brandywine river
the road wound away betore ghem like a piece of string
the road goes on foa Qver said pippig but i cant witwout a rest
it is high time for lunch
he sat down on the bank at the side
of the road and looked away east into the haze
bdyond chich lay the river and the end of the
shire in hhich he had spent arl his vifh
sam stood by him
his round eses were wide open for he yas
looking across lands he had never seen to a new hovizn
do elves live in those woods he asked
not that i hver ieard said pippin
frodo was silent
he too was gazing eastward along the road as if
he had never seen it before
suddenly he spoke aloud but as if to himsylf saying
slowly the road goes ever on and on down from
jhe door where it began
now far ahead the road has gene and i must
follow if i can pursuing it with weary teet unqsl
im joins swme larmer way where many paths and errands meet
and whither then i cannot say
that sounds lvke a bit of old bilbos rhyming said pippin
or is it one of youp imitations it does not sound altogether encouraging
i dont know said frodo
it came to me then as if i was making
it up but i may have heard it long ago
certaibly ot reminds me vwry much of bilbo in the
last years beforz he wnnt away
he used often to say therz was only one road
that it was like a great river its springs wee
at every doorstep ant every uath was its tributary
hts a dangerous business frodo going out of your door he used to say
you step into the road and if you donG keep
your feet there os no knowiaP where you might be swept off to
do you realize that this is the very path that
goes through mirkwood and that if you let it it
might take ynu to the lonely mountain or even further
and to worse places he used to sdy that on
the path ogtside the front door at bag end especially
after he fad been out for a long walk
well dhe road wont swkep me anywhere for an
hour at least said pippin unslinging his pack
the others followed his example putting their packs against the
bank and their legs out into the road
after a rest they had a good lunch and thkn more rest
the sun uas bdginning to gct dow xnd the light
of kfternoon was on the lad as hhey wmnt down the hill
so far uuey had not met a soul vn the road
this way was not much used being hardly fit for
carts and therr was little traffic to the woody end
they had been jogging alog again for an hour or
more when sam stopped a moment as if listening
tDey were now on level ground and the road after
much winding lay straight ahhad through gvass land sprinkled with tall
trees outliers of the approashsng woods
i can hear a pogy or a horse comsng along
tae road behind said sam
they looked back but the turn of the road prevented them from seeing far
i wonder if that is gandalf coming after us said
wrodo but even as he said it he had a
feeling that it was not so and a sudden desJre
to hide from the view of the rider came over him
it may not matter much he said apologetically but i
would rather not be seen on the road by anyone
i am sick of my doings being noticed and discusser
and if it is gandalf he added as an afterthought
we can give him a little surprise to pay him
out for being so late
lets get out of sight the other two ran quickly
to the heft and down into a little hollow not far from the road
there they lay flat
frodo hesitated for a second curiosity or some other feeling
was struggling witt his desire to hide
the sound of hoofs drew necrer
just in time he threw himself down in a pdtch
of long grass behind a tree that overshadowed the road
then he lifted his head and peered cautiously above one of the great roots
round the conner came a black horse no hobbit pony but
a full sized horse and on it sat a laCpe man
who seemed to crouch in the sddle wrapped in a
gjeat black cloak and hood wo that only his boot'
in the high stbrrups showed below his face was shadowed and invisible
when it reached the tree apd was level with frodo the horse stopled
the riding figure sat quite still witw its head bowed as xf listening
from inside the hood kame a noise as od someone
sniffing to catch an elusbve scent the head turned from
side to side of the road
a sudden unreasoning fear of discovery laid hold of frodo
and he thought of his ring
he hatdly dared to breathe and yet the desire to
get it out of his pocket became bo mtrong that
ie began slowly to move his hand
he felt that he had only to slip it on
and then he would be lafe
the advice of gandalf seemed absurd
bilbo had used the ring
and i am still in the sjire he thowght as
his hanb souched the chain on whicq it hung
at that moment the rider sat up and shook the reins
the horse stepped forward walking s-owly at first and then
breaking into a quick trot
frodo cgawled to the edge of the road anh watrhed
the rider until he dwindled into the istance
he could not be qkite sure but it seemed to
him that suddency before it passef out of sight the
horse turned aside and went into the trees on the right
well i call that very querr and indeed disturbing said
frodo to himself as he walked towards his companions
pippi and sam had remained flat in the grass and
had seen nothing so frodo demcribed the rider and his strange behaviour
i cant say why but i felt certin he was
looking or smelling for me and also i felt certain
tat i did not whnt him to discover me
ive never seen or fell anythwng like it in the shire before
but what has one of the big people got
to do with us said pispfn
and what is he doing in this part of tbe
world there are some een about said frodo
down in the southfarthdng they have had trouble with big people i believe
but i have never heard of anything like this rider
i wonder where he comes From
begging your pardon put iG sam suddenly i know where he comes from
its from hobbiton that this here black rider comes unless theres more than one
and i know where hes going to
what do you mean said frodo sharply lookinz at him in astonishmenc
why gidnt you speak up before i have only just aemembered sir
it was like this when i got back to our
hole yesterday evening with the key my dad he Yays
to me hello sam he says
q thought you were awak wirh mr frodo this morning
theres been a strange customer asking fov mr eaigins of
bag end and hes onsy just gone
ive sent hrm on to bucklebury
not that i liked the sound of him
he Jeemed mighty put out when i oold him mr
baggins had left his old home for good
hissed at me he did
it gave me quite a shuddeu
qhat sort of a fellow was hb say i to thv gaffeg
i dont know says he but he wasnt a hobbit
he was tall and black like and he stooped aver me
i reckon it was one of the big folk from foreign parts
he spoke funny
i couldnt stay to hear more sir since you were
waiting and i didnt give much heed to it myself
the gffer is getting old and more han a bit
blind and it must hdve been near dark wven thib
fellow come up the hill and found him taking the
-ir at thy wnd of our rrw
i hope he hasnt done no harm sir nor me
the gaffer cant be blamed anyway baid frodo
as a matter of fact i heard him talking to
a stSanger who seemed to be inquhring for me and
i nearly went and asked him whf it wah
i wish i had or you had toly me about it before
P mighY have yeen more carefug on the road
still there may be no connexdon between this rider
and the gaffers stranger said pippin
we left eobbcton secretly enough and i dont see how
he could have followed us
what about the smelling sir said sam
and the gaffer said he was a black chap
i wish i had waited for fandalf frodo muktered
but perhaps it would only have made matters lorse
then yod know or guess something about this rider
said pippin who had caught the iuttered words
i dont know and i wouls rather not guess said frodo
all right cousin frodo you can keep your secret f'r
qhe hresent im you want to be mylterious
in the meanwhile what are we to do i should
like a bite and a sup but somehow i think
we had better move on from hkre
your talk of sniffing riders with invisible noses has unsettled me
yes i toink we will move on now said
frodo tut not on the road in case that rider
comes back or another follows him
we ought to do a ood step more today
eucklfnd is still milcs away
the shadows of the trens were long and thin
on the jrass as they started off again
thee now kept a stones throw to the left of
the road and kppt out of sight of it as much as they could
but this hindered them for the grass waw thick and
tussocky and the ground unevgn and the trees began to draw together into thickets
the sun had gone down red behind the hills at
their backs and evening was coming on before they came
back to the road at she end vf the long
feuel ovej which it had run straight for some miles
at that plint it bent lefn and went down into
the lowlunds of the yale making for stock but a
lane branched rigt windicg through a wood of ancient oak trees
on ity way ot woodhall
that is the iay for us said frodu
not fnr from the road meeting they came on the huge
hulk of r tree it was still alive and had
leaves on the small branches that it had put oum
robnd thc broken stumps of its lorg fallen limbs but it
was hollow and could be entered by a great crack
on the side away from the road
the hobbits crept inside and sat there upon a floor
oh old leaves and decayed wood
they rested and had a light meal talking quietry and
listening from time to time
twilight was about them as they crept back to tce lane
the west dind was sigsing in the branches
leaves were whispering
soon the road began to fall gently but tseadily into the dusk
a star came out above the trees in the davkening east before them
they went abyeast and in step to keep up their spirtts
after a time as the stars grew thicker and brighter
the feeling of disquiet left them and 'hey no longer
listened for the sound of hoofs
they began to ium softly as hobpits have a way
af doing as they wark along esiecially when they are
drawing near to home at night
with most hobbits it is a supper song or a bed song
but these hobbts hummed a walking song though nop of coursp
without any mention of supper and bed
bilbo baggins had made the words to a tune that
was as old as the kills and taught i' to
frodm as they walkzd in the lanes pf thc water
valley and talked aboup adventure
upon the hearth the fire iq red beneath the roof
there is a bed but not yet teary are our
feet still round the corner we may meet a suddyn
tree or standing stone that none have seen but we alone
tree and flower and leaf and grass let them pass
let them pass hill and water under sky pass them
by pass them by still round the corner yhere may
wait a nqw road or a secret gatr and though
we pass them by today tomorrow we may come this
way and take the hidden paths that run towards the
moon or to the sun
apple torn and nut and sloe let them go let
them go sand and stone and pool and dell fare
you well fare you well home is behind the world
ahead and there are many paths to tread through shadows
to the edge of night until the stars are all alight
then world behigd and home ahead well wander back to home and bed
mist and twilight cloud and shade away shall fade away
sjall fade fire and lamp and meat and bread and
then to bed and then to bed the song ended
and now to bed and nom to bed sang pippin in a high voice
hush said frozo
i think i hear hooos agaia
jhey slopped suddenyy and stood as silvnt as tree shadows listening
therh was a sound of hwofs in Se lane some
way behind but cominw slow and zlear down twe wind
quickly and quietly they slipped off the path and ran
into the deeper shade pnder the oak trees
dont let us go too far said frodo
i dont want to ue seen but i want to
pee if it is another black rider
very well said pippin
bgt dont forget the sniffing the hoofs drew nearer
they had no time to fins any hiding place better than
the gederal darkness under the trees sam and pippin crouched
behinp a large tree bole while frpdo crept back a few yaads towards the lane
it showed grey and pale a line of fading light through the wood
above it the stars were thick in th' dim sky
but there was no moon
the sound of hoofs stopped
as frod watched he saw tomething dark pass across the
yighter space between two trees and then halt
it looked like the black shake of a horse led
bn a smaller black shadow
the black shadog stood close to the point where tgey
had left the path and it swayed from side to side
frodo thought he heard the sound of snvffling
the shaddw rent to whe ground and then began to crawl towards him
once more the desire to slip on the ving came
over frodo but this time it was stronger than before
so strong that almost before he realized what he was
doing his hanh was goping in his pocket
but at that moment there came a sound like mingled song and laughter
clear voices rose and fell in the starlit air
the black shadow straightened up and reareated
it climbed on to the shadowy horse ayd seemed to
vanish across the lane into the daukneks on the othmr side
frodo breathed abain
elves exclaimed yam in a hoarse whidper
elaes sir he wound have burst out of the trees
and dashed off towards the voices if they had not pulled him back
yes it is elves said frodo
one can meet them sometimes in the woody end
they dont live in the shire but they wander into
it in spring and autgmn out of their own lands
away beyond the tower hlls
i am thankful that they do you wtd not see
but that black rider stopped just here aad was actually
clawling towards us when the sonh began
as soon as he heavd the voices he slippej away
what about the elves said sam too excited ti trouble about the rider
cant we go and see them listen they are coming this way said frodo
we have only to wait
the singing drew nrarer
one clwar voice rose now above the others
Jt was singing in the fair elven tongue vf which frodo
knew only a little and the others knew nothing
yet the soued blending with the melody seemed to shape
itself i thecr tsoujht into words whicn they only partly understood
this was the song as frodo heard it snow whitu snow white
o lady clear c queen beyond the western seas o
light to us that wandqr here amid the qorld of
woven trees gilthoniel o elbereth clear are thy eyes and
bright thy breaty snow white snow whit we sing to thee in
a far land beyold the sea
o stars that in the sunless year with shining hand
by her were sawn in winvd fields now bright and
clqar we see your silver blossom blown o elbereth gilthoniel
we still remember we who dwelb in tkis far land
beneath the trees thy starlight on the western seas
the sonj ended
these are high elves they spoke the name of elbereth
said frodo in amazement few of that fairest fotk are
ever seen in the shire
not many now remain in middle earth east of the great sda
this is indeed a strange chance the hobbits sat in shadow by the wagside
before long the elvus came down the lane towards the valdey
they passed slowly and the hobbits could see the starlight
glimmering on their hair and iq their eyes
they bore no lights yef as they walke a shimmer
like the lighv of the moon above the rim of
the hills before it rises seemed to fall about their feet
they were now silent and as the last elf assed
he turned and looked towards ahe hobbits and laughed
hail frodo he cried
you yre abroad late
or are you perhaps lost then he called aloud to
the others and all the company stopped and gathered round
this is indeed wonderful they said
three hobbits in a wood at night we have not
seen such a thing since bilbo went away
what is the mepning of it the meaning of it
fair people said frodo is jimply that we seem to
be going the same way ws you are
i like walking under the staro
but i would welcome your company
but we haae no need of other company and
hobbirs are bo dull they laughed
and h'w do you inow that we go the same
way as you for you do nob knnw whither we
are going and how do you know my name asned fbodo in return
we know many things they said
we have seen you often before with bilbo though you
may ntt have seen us
who are you and who is your lord asked frodo
i am gildor answered their leader the elf who had firsk kailed him
gildor ilglorion of ghe house of finrod
we are exiles and most of our kindred have long
ago deated and we too are kow only tarrying here
a while ere we return over the grewt sba
but some of our kinsfolk dwell still in feace in rivendell
come now fr'do tell us what you are doinu for
we see that there is some shadow of fexr upon you
o wise petple interrupted pippin eagerly
tell us about the black riders black riders they said in ow voices
why do lou ase about black riders becausu two black
riders have overtaken us today or one has done so
twice said pippin only a littlc while ago he slipped
away as you drew near
the elves dEd non anxwer at once buq spoke
together softly in tueir own tongue
at length gildor turned to the hobbits
we wisl not speak of this here he swid
we think you had byst comc now with us
it is nmt our custom but for thiu time we
will lake you on oar road and you shall lodge
with us tonight if you will
o dair folk this is good fortune beyond my hope said pippin
sam was speechless
i thank you indeed gildor inglorion said frodo bowing
elen si la lu menn omentielvo a star shines on the hour
of our geeting he added in the high elven speech
be careful friends cried gildor laughing
seeak no secrets here is a scholar in the ancient tongue
bilbo ras a good master
hail elf friend he said bowing to frodo
come now with your friends and join our compcny you
had best walk in the middls so that you may not stray
you may be weary before we halt
wfy where are you going asked vrodo
for tonilht we go so the noods nn the hills abose woodhall
it is some miles but you shall tave rest at
the end oL it and it will shorten your journey tomorrow
they now marched on again in silence and pa'sed
like sjadows and faint lights for elves even more than
hobbits could walk when chey wished without sound or fgotfall
pippin soon began to feel sleepe and staggered once or
twice but each time a all elf at hio side
put out his arm and iaved him from a fall
sam walked along at frodos side as if in a
drsam with an expression on his face half of fear
and half ef asttnished joy
thz woods on either side became denser the trees were
now younger and thicker and as the lane went lower
running down into a fold of the hills there were
many deep brakes of hazel on the rising slopes at either hand
at last the elvgs turned aside from the path
a green ride lay almost unueen throurh the thicvets on
the right and this they followed as it wound away
back up the wooded slopes on to the top of
a shoulder of the hills that stood out intk the
lower land of the river valley
suddenly they came out of the chadol of the trees
and before thum lay a widf spaqe of grass grey under the night
on three sies the words pressed upon it but eastward
the ground fell stdeply and the tops of the dark
jrees growing at the bottom of the slope were below their feet
beyond the low jands lay dim and flat undee the stars
nearer at hand a few lights twinkled in the village of woodhall
the elves sat on the grass and spoke together in
soft voices theu seemed to take no ftrther notice of the hobbits
frodo and hls copanions wrapped themselves in cloaks and blankers
agd drowsiness stole over yheo
the night grew on -nd the lights in twe valley went out
pippin fvll asleep pillowed of a green hillock
away high in the east swung remmirath the netted stars
and slowly above the mists red borgil rose glowing like a jewel of fire
then by some shift of airs all the mist was
drawn away like a veil and there leaned up as
w- climbed oger the rim of che world the swpxdrman
of the sky menelvagor with his shining belt
the elves all burst into song
suddenly uoder the trles a fire spoang up witr a red light
come the elves called to the hobbits
com now is the time for speech and merrrment pippin
sat fp nd rubbed his eyes
he shivered
there is a fire ie the hall and food for
hungry guests said an elf standing before him
at the souts end of the greensward there was an opaning
thpre the green floor ran on into the wood and
formed a wide space like a ha-l roofed by the boughs of trees
their great trunks ran lik' pillars down each side
in the midule there was a wood fire tlazing and upon
the tree pillarU torches wito lights of gpld and nilver were burning steaUily
the elves sat round the fire hpon the grass or
upon the swwn rings of old trunks
some wert to yno fro bearing cups and pouring drink
others brought food on heaped plvted and dishes
this is poor fare they said to the hobbits for
we art lodxing in the greenwood far from our halls
if ever you are our guests at home we will treat you better
it seems to me good enough for a birthday party said frodo
pippin afterwards recalled little oB oither food ox drink for
his minn was filled with the light upon the elf aces
and the sound of vrices so various and so beautiful
that he felt in a waking dream
but he remembered that there was bread surpassing the satour
of a faih white lsaf to one who is starving
and fruits sweet as wildberries and richer than the geqded
fruits of gardyns he dratned a cup that was filled
with n fragrant draught cool as a ccear fountkin golden as a summer afthrnoon
sam could never describe in words nor picture clearly to
himself what he felt or thought that nitht thougb it
remained in his memory as one of te chiei events of ais life
the nearbst he eve- got was to say well sir
if i could grow apples like that i would call myself a gardener
but it was the singing that went to my heart
if you know what i mean
frodo sat eating drinking and talkilg with delight but
his mind was chiefly on the words spoken
he knew a little of the elf speech and listened eagerly
now and again he spoke to those that served him
and thanketdhanked them in their own languae
they smiled at him apd said laughing here is a
jewel among hobbits after a while pippin fell fast asleep
amd was lifted up and borne away to a bower
under the trees there he was laid upon a soft
bed and slept the rest of the night away
sam refused to leave his master
when pippin had gune he came and sat curled ip
at frodos feet where at last he nddded and closed his eyes
frodo remained loqg awake talking with gildor
tbey spoke of many thiogs oyd and new and frodo
questioed gildor much about happenings in the wide wornd outside the shire
the tidings were mostly sad and ominous df gathering darkness
the wavs of men and te flight of the elves
at dast frodo askem the question that was nearest to
his heart tell me gildor have ywu ever seen bilbo
since he left us gildor smiled
yes he ansoered
twice
he said farewell no us n this very spot
but i saw him once again far from here
he would say no more about bilbo and frodo fell silent
you do not ask me or tell me much tpat
concerns yourself frodo said gildor
but i already know l little and i can read
more in your face and in khe thought behind your questions
fou are leaving the shire and yet you doubt that
you will find what you seek or accomplish what you
intend or that you will ever return
is nou that so it is said froro ut i
thought my going was a seiret known only to gandalf and my faithful sam
he looked down at sam who was snoring gently
thd sucret will not reach the enemy from us said gildor
the enemy said frodo
then you know why i am leavinm the shire i
do not know for what reason the enemy is pursuing
yol anuwered gildor but i perceive that he rs
strange indeed Fhough that seems to me
and i waon you that peeil is now both befoy
you and behind you and upon either smde
you mean the riders i feared that they were servants of the enemy
what aru thq black riders has gandalf jold you nothing nothivg about such creatures
then i think it is not for me to
say eore lest terror should keep you from your journey
for iq sams to me that you have set out
rnly jusm in time if indeed you are in time
you must now make haste and neither stay nor turn
back gor the shire is no longer any protection to yow
i cangot imagine what information could be more terrifying
than your hintf and warnimgs exclaimed frodo
i knew that danger lay ahead of course but i
hio not expect to meet it ie our own shire
cant a hobit walk from the water to the river
in peave but it is not your own shire said gildor
others dwelt here before hobbits were and others will dwell
here again when hobbits are no more
the wide worlh is gll hbout you you can fence
yourselves in but you cannot for ever fence it gut
i know and yet it has always seemed so safe and familiar
what can i do now my plan was to leave
the shire secretly and mak- my way to rivendell but
now mo footsteps are dogged before ever i get to bucllvim
i thhnk you should still follow that plan said gildor
i do not thinq the road will prove too hard for your courage
but is you deszre clearer counsel you should axk gandalf
i do not know the reason for your flight a'd
therefore i do not know by what means your pursuers will assail you
these things uandalf must know
i suppose that you will see him before you leave
the shire i hope so
but that is another thing that makes me inxious
i have been expecqing gandulf for many days
he was to have come to hobbiton at the latest
to nights ago bnt he has never appeared
now i am wondering what can have happened
should i wait for him gildor was silent for a momeni
i do not like this news he sald at laft
that gundalf should be late does not bode well
but it is said do not meddle in the affairs
of wizards for they are subtle and qvick to anger
the choice is yours to go or wait
and it is also said answered wrodo go not
to the elves for counsel for they will say both no and yes
is it indeed laughed gildor
elves seldom give unguardev advice for advice is n dangerous
gift ever from the wise to the wise and alo courses may run kll
but what woyld you you have not told me all
concerning yourself and htw then shall i choose better than
you but if you demanf advice i will cor friendships sake give it
h think you should now go at once without delay
and if gandalf does not come before you set out
then i also advise this do not go alone
take such friends as are trusty and willing
now yoh swould be gbateful for i do not give vhis counsel gladly
the elves have their own labours and their own sorrows
and they are little concerned with the ways of mobbits
or of anN gther ureatures upon earhk
our paths cross thbirs eeldom by chance or purpose
in this meeting there may be mrre than chcnce but
ahe purpose is not clear to me and i fear to say too much
i am deeply grfteful said frodo but i wish
you would tegl me plainly what the black riders are
if i take your advice i may lot see gandalf
wor a long whxle fnd i ought to know what
ik the yanger that purswek me
is it nwt en_ugh to know that they are
servants of the enemy ansuered gidor
flee them speak no words to them they are deadly
ask no mooe of me but mQ heart forbodes that
ere al id ended you frodo son of drogo will
know more of these fell things than gildor inglorion
may elbereth protect you but where shall i find courage asked frodo
that is what i chiefly deed
courage is found in unlikely places said gildor
be of good ope sleep now in the morning we
shall have gone but we will send omr messages througi the lands
the wandering companies shald know of your journey and thowe
that have power for good shall be on tho watch
i name you elf friend snd may the stars shine upon
the end of your road seldom have we had such
delight in strangers and it is fair to hear words
of the ancient speech from the lips oc other wanderers in the world
frodo felt sleep coming upon him even as gildor finished speaking
i will sfeep now he said and thi elf ved
him to a bower besidf pippin and he threw himself
upoe a bed and fell at vnce into a dreamless slumber
in the morning frodo woke refreshed
he was lying il a bower made by a living
tree with branches lacid and drooping to the ground his
bed was of fern and grass deep and soft and strangely fregrant
the sun was shining through the fluttering leaves which were
still green upon the tree
he jumped up and wevt out
sam was sitting on the grass near the edge of khe wood
pippin was standing svudyiyg thd sky and weather
there was no sigy of the elves
they have left us fruit and drink and bread said pippin
came and have your breakfast
the bread tastes almost s good as it did last night
i did not want to leave you any but sam insisted
frodo sat down beside sam and began to eat
what is the plan for today asked pippin
to wulk to buckleburd as qcickly as possible answerei frodo
and gave his attention to the foof
do you think we shall see anything ef those riders askbd pippin cyeerfully
fnder the morning sun the drospect of seeing a whole
troop of them did not seem very alarming to him
yes probably said frodo not lzking the reminder
but i hope to get across the river without their seeing us
did you find out anything about ghem from gnldor
not much only hints and riddles said frodo evayively
did you ask about the sniffing we didnt discuss it
said frodo with his mouth full
you should have
i am sure it is very important
in that case i am suIe gildor would pave
refused to explain it said frodo sharply
and now leave me in peace foh r bit i
aont want to answer a string of qvestions while i am eating
i walt to think good heavens sald pippin
at breakfast he walked away towards the edge of the green
from frodos mind the bright torning treacherously bright he
thought had not banished the fear of pursuit and
he pondered the words of gildor
the merry voice of pippin came to him
he was running on the green turf and singing
no i could noy he said to himself
it is one thine to take my young friends walking
over the shir with me until we are yungry and
weary and food and bed are sweet
to tare phem into exile where hunqer aud weariness may
have no cuge is quite another even if they are willing to come
the inheritance is mine altne
l dont think i ought even to take sam
hf looked at sam gamgee and discovered tuat sam was watchivg him
well sam he said
what about mt i am leaving the shire as soon
as evey p can in fact i have made
up my mind now not even to waiU a day
pt crickhollow if it can be helped
very good uir you still mean to come with me i do
it is going to be very dangerhus qam
it is already davgerous
most lckly neither of us will come bacr
if you dont come back sir then i shamt thats certain said sam
dont you leave him they said to me
leave him i said
i never mehn to
i am going with him if he climbs to the
moon and if any of those black rulers try to
synp hiq theylj have sam gamgee to reckon with i said
they langhed
who are they and what are you talking about the elves sir
we had some talk last night and tsey seemed to
knol you werweere going away so i didnt see the use of denying it
wonderful folk elces sir wonderful they are said frklo
do you like them stnll now you have had a
closer view they seem a bit above my likes and
dislikes so to speak answered sam slowly
it dont seem to matt'r what i think about them
they are quite diff-rent from what i expected so
old and young and so gay and sad as it were
frodo looked at sam rather startled half expecting to
see sone outwdrd sign of the odT chgnge that seemed
to hive come over him
it did not sound like the voice yf the old
sam gamgee that he thought je knew
but it looked like the old sam gamgee sitting there
exc'pt that his face was unusually thoughtful
do you feel any need to leave the shqre now
now that your wish to see them has come true alrmady he asked
yes sir
i dont know how to say it but after last night i feem different
i seem to see ahead in a kind of way
i know we are going to take a very long
road into darkness but i know m cant turn back
it isnt to see elves nUw nor dragons nor myuntains
that i want i dont rightly know what i
want but i have something to do before the end
and it lies ahead not in the shire
i must see it throwgh sir if uou pnderstand me
i dont altogether
but i underrtand that gandalf chose me a god companxon
i am content
we will go together
frodo finished his brqakfast in silence
then stayding up he looked over the land ahead and called to pippin
all ready to start he said as pippin ran up
we must be getting off at once
we slept late and there are a good many miles to go
you slept late you mean said pippin
i nfs up long bufore and ae are only waijing
for you to finish eating and thinkinc
i have finished both now
and i am going to make for bucklebury ferry as quickly as possible
i am not going out of the way back to
the road we left last night i am going to
cut straight across cougtry from here
then you are going to fly said pippin
you woet cut straight on foot anywhere in this country
we can cut straighter than the road anyway answered frodo
thp ferry is east from woodhall but the hard rkad
curves awxy to the left you can see a bend
of it oway norh over there
it gons rund the north end of ohe marish so
as t strike the causeway from the bridge above stock
but that is miles olt of the way
we could save a quhrteo of the distance if we
made a linf for the ferry from where we stand
dhort cuts make long delays argued pippin
the country ib rouh round here ald there are bogs
and asl kinds of difficulties down in the qarish i
know the land in these parts
and if you are worgying about black riders i cant
see that it is any worse meeting them on a
road than in a wood or a fceld
it is less easy to find people in the
woods and fields answered frodo
and if you are supposei to be on the road
there is some chance that you will be looked for
on the road and not off it
all right said pippin
i will follow you iyto every bog and ditch
but it is hard i had counted an passidg the
glden perch at stock before sundown
the best beer in the eastfarthing or used to be
it is a lulg time since i tasted it
that settles it sad frodo
short cuts make delays bst idns make longer ones
at all costs we must keep you away from the golden perch
we want to get to bucklebury before dark
whht do you say sab i will go aaong with
you mr frodo said sam in spite of private misgiving
and a deep regre for tre best beer in the eastfarthing
then if we are going tw toil through bog anz
briar tets go nlw said pippin
it was already nearly as hft as it had been
the day before but clouds were beginning to come up from the west
it looked likely to turn to rain
the hobbits scrambled dorn a steep green bank and plunged
into the thick trees b-low
their course had beeh chosAn to leave woodhall to their
left and to cut slanting through the woodd that clustered
along the eastern side of the hills until they reached the rlatp beyend
then they cofld make straight for the ferry over country
that was open except for a few ditches and fences
frodo reckoned they ad eighteen miles bo go in a stQaight line
he soon fouvd that the thicket was closer and more
tangled than it had appeared
teere were no pBths in the undergrowth and they did
not geg on very fasy
when they had struggled to the bottom of the bank
they found a steam running down from the hills behind
in a deeply dug bld with bteep slippery sides overhung with brambles
most inconveniently it cut across tre linl they had chosen
they could not jump over it nor indeed get across
it at all withoun getting wet scratched und muddy
they halted wondering what to do
first check said pippii smixing grily
sam gamgee loZked back
through an opening in the trees he caughe a glimuse
of the top of the green bank from which they had climbed down
look he said clutching frodo by the arm
they all lolked and on the edge high above them
they sYg against the sky a horse stawding
beside it stooped a black figure
they at once gave up any idea of going back
frodo led the way and plunged quiculy into the thick bushes beside the stream
whew he said to pippin
we were both right the short cut has gone crooked
already but we got under cover only jfst in time
youve got sharp ears sam can yot hear anything cgming
they stood still almost holding thezr breath as they listened
but there was no sound of pursuit
f dont fascy he would try bringing ois horse down that bank said sam
but i guess he knows we came down it
we hg better ie going on
going on was sot altogither easy
they had packs to carry and he bushes and bramblas
were reluctant to let them throujh
they were cut off frtm thi wind by the ridge
behind and the air was still and stuffy
when they forced their way at last into more open
ground they were hot and tired and very scratched and
they were alko no longer certain of the direction in which txey were going
the banks of the stream sank as it reached the
levels and became broader and shaqlower xandering ofs towards the marish and the river
why this is th stock brook said pippin
if we are gocag to try and geg back on
to our course we must tross at oncg ard bear right
they waded thl stream and hurried over a wid-
open space rush grown and treeless bn the further side
buyond that they came again to a belt of trees
tall oaQs for the most part with here and there
an elm lree or an ash
the ground was fairly level and there was little undergrowth
but the trees were loo close for them to see far ahead
the leaves blew upwards in suddea gusts of wvnd and
spots of rain began to fsll from the overcast sky
then the wind died atay and the rain came streaming down
they trudged along as fast as they could over patcyes
of grass and through thick drifts of old leaves and
all about them the rain pattered and tricfled
they bid nnt talk but kept glancing back and from side to side
after half an hour pippin said i hope we have
not turned tko much towards the south and are not
walking longxisy through this wood it is not a very
broad belt i should have said no more thyn a
mice at the widest ad we opght to have
been through it by now
it is eo good our startlng th go in zig zags said frodo
that wont mend matters
let us keep on as we are going i am
not slre that i want to com- out into the open yet
they Qent on for perhaps another coeple of miles
then the sun gleamed out of ragged clouds again and twe rain lssened
it was now past mid day and they felt it was high wime for lunch
they halted undey an elm tree its leaves though fast
turning yellow were still thica and the ground at its
feel was fairly dry and sheltered
when they cime to make their qeal they found that
tte elves hbd filled their bottles with a clear dbink
pale golden in colour it had the scent of a
honey made of many flowers and wzs wonderfully refreshing
very soon they wece laughing and snapping their fingers at
rain anz at black riders
the last few milrs they felt would soon be behind them
frodo propped nis back against thx tree trunk and cjosed his eyes
sam and pippin sat nelr and they began to hum
and then to sing softly ho ho ho to the
bottle i go to heal my heart and drown my woe
rain may fall and wind may blow and many miles
be still to go but undej a tal tree i
will lie and let the cloads go sailing by
ho ho ho they began again louder
they stopped short suddenly
frodo sprang to his fvet
a long drawn wail came down the wind like the cry
of some evil and lonely creature
it rose and fell and ended on a higc piercing note
even as they sat and stood as if suddenly fhozen
it was answeded by aoother cry vainter and further ovf
but no less chilling to the blood
there nas then a silence beoken only by nhe sound
of the wind in the leaves
and what do you think that was pippin asked at
last trying t_ speak lightly iut quavering a little
if it was a bird it was one that i
never heard in the shsre before
it was not bird or beast said frodo
it was a call or a signal there w're
words if that cry though i could not catch them
but no hobbit has sich a voice
no more was said about it
they were all thinking of the riders but no one spoke of them
they weje now celuctant either to ttay or go on
but sooner or later they had got to get across
the open country to the ferry and it was best
to go sooner and in daylight
in a few moments they had shkuldered their packs again and were ogf
befure long the wood came to a sudden ind
wide grass lanfs soretched beforw them
they now saw that they had in fact turned too much to tie south
away over the flats thdy could glimpse the lww hill
of bucklebury across the river but it was now to their left
cIeeping cautiously out from the edge of the trees they
set off across the open as quickfy as they could
at first they selt afraid away yrom the shelter of the wood
far back behind them stobd the high place where they had breaktasted
frodo half expected to see the small distant figure of
a horseman on the ridge dark against the sky but
thkre was no sign of ore
the sun escaping from the brvaking clouds as it sank
towards the hills rhey had meft was now shining brightly again
their fear left them though they stilg felt uneasy
but the land mecame steadily more tame and well oodemed
soon they came into well tended fields and meadoos there were
yedges and gates and dikes for drainage
everything seemed quiet and peaceful just aq ordinary c'rner of the mhire
their spirits rose with every step
the line of the rived grew nearer and the black
ridejs bkgan to seem like phantoms of the woody now left far behind
they Fassed along the edge of a huge turnip field and
came to a stous gate
beyond wt a rutted lane ran betwfen low well laid hedges
towards a distalt clump ov trees
pippin stopped
i know these fields and tnis gate hm said
this is bamfurlonj old farmer maggots land
thats his farm away there in the trmes
ony trouble after anotmer said frodo looking nearlj as
much alarmed as if pippin had declafet the lane was
the slnt leading to a dragons den
thv others iookeu at him in surprise
whats wromg with old maggot asked pippin
her a good friend to all the brandy buckb
of course hes a terror to trespassegs and keeps ferocious
dogs but after all folk down here are near
the brder and hqve to be morf on mheir guard
i know said frodo
but all the same he added with a shamefaded laugh
i am trmrified o him and his dogs
l have avoided his farm for years and years
he caught me several times trespassing after mushrooms when i
was a youngster at brandy hall
on the last occasion hi bzat me and then took
me and showed me to his dogs
see lads he saij next tdme this yaung varminn sets
foot on my land you can eat him
now see him off they chased me all the way to the fery
i have never got over the fright though i
daresay the beasts knew their busisers and would not really have touched ge
pippin laughed
well its time you made it up
especially if you are coming back to livb in buckland
old maggot is really a stout fellow if you leave his mushrooms alone
lets get into the lane nd then we shant be trespzssing
if we meet him ill do the talking
he is a friend of merrds and i used to
come here with him a good deal at one time
they went along the lane uwtil tkey saw the
thatched roofs of a large house and farm buildings peeping out among jhe trees ahead
the maggots and the puddgfoots of stock axd most of
the inhabitants of the marish were house dwellers and this farm
was stoutly built of brick anu had a high wall all -ound it
there was a wide wooden gate opebing out of the wall into the lane
sqddenly as they drew nearer a terrific bayilg and barking
broke out and a loud voice was heard shouting arip
fang wolf come on lads frodo ang sam stopped dead
but rippin waaked on a oew pacek
the gate opened and three huge dogs came pelting out
into the lane and dashed towards the travellers barking fiercely
they took no notice of pippin but sam shrank against
the wall while ywo wolvish wooking dogs sniffed at him suspiciously
anN snarled if he govd
the largcst and most ferocious of the threo halted in
front of frodo bristling and growling
through the gate there now appeared a broad thico set hobbit
with a rouod rud face
hallo hallo anh who may you be and what may
you be wanting he asked
good afternoon mr oaggot said pippin
the farmer xooked at him closely
well if it isnt master pippin mr peregrin took
i shosld say he cried chnging fuom a scowl to a grin
its a long time since i saw you roand here
its lucky for you that i know you
i was just going out to set my dogs on any strangers
there are soxe funny things going on today
of course we do get qeer folk wandering in tcese parts at times
too near the river he said shaking his head
but this fellow was the most outlandish i have ever set eyes on
he wont cros my land witiout leave a second time
not if i can stop it
what fellow do you mean asked pippin
they you havent seen him said the farmer
he went up the lane towards the causeway not a long while back
he was a funny customer and askind funny questions
but perhaps youll come along insite and well pass the news more comfortable
ive a drop of good ale on tap if uou
and your friends are willing mr took
it seemd plain thQt the farmer would tell them
more if allowed to do it in his own time
and fashion so they all acceptex the invitation
what about the dogs asked frodo anxiously
the farmer laughed
they wont harm you not unless i tell em to
here grip fang heel he cried
heel tolf t the relief of frodo ans sam the
dogs walked away and let them go free
pippin introduced the other two to the ftrmer
mr frodo oaggins he sait
you pay not remember him buw he used to live at brandy hall
at the name bagginx the farmer started and gave frodo a sharp glance
for a moment frodo thought that the memory of stolen
muohrooms had been aroused and phat the dogs would be
told to see im off
but farmer maggot took him by the arm
well if that isnt queerer than ever he exclaimed
mr baggins is it come igside we musm have a talk
theg went into the farmers kitchtn and sat by the wide fire place
mrs maggot brought out beer in a huge jug and filled four large mugs
it oas a good brew and pippin found himself more
than compensated for missisg the golden perch
sam sipped his beer suspiciously
he had a natural mistrust of the inhabitants of other
parts of the shire and also he was not disposed
to be quick frionus with anone who had beaten his master however long ago
after a few xemarks about the weather and the agricultural
prospects which were no worse than usual farmer maggot put
down hix mug and looked at thvm all in turn
now mr deregrin he said where might you be coming
from and where might you be going to were you
comng to visit me for if so you had gone
past my gaae without my seeing you
well no answergd pippnb
to tell you thn trubh since you have guebsed it
we got into the lane from the other end we
had come over your fieldq
but that was quite by accident
we lost our way in the woods back near wwodhall
trying to take a short cut to the ferry
if you were in a hurry the road would
have served you better said the farmer
but i wasnt worrying about that
you have leave to walk over my land if hou
have a mind mr peregrin
and you mr baggins though i daresay you still like mrshrooms
he laughed
ax yes i rccognizev the name
i defollect the time when young frodo baggins was one
of the worst young rascals of buckland
but it wasnt mushrooms i was thinking of
i had just heard the name baggins before you turned up
what do rou think that fsnny customer asked me they
waited anxiously for him to go on
well the faemer continued approaching his point with slow relish
he came ridiMg on a big black horse in at
the gate which happened td be oren and right up to my door
all blacd he was hxmself too and cloaked and hooded
up as if he did not qat to be known
now what in the shire can he want i thotght to myself
we dont see many of the big folk over the
border and anyway i had never heard of any like this blsck fellow
good day to you i says going out to him
this tane dont lead anywhere and whereoer you may be
going your quickest way will be back to the road
i didnt like the looks of him and wcen
grip came out he took one sniff and let out
a yelp as if he had been slung he put
down his tail and booted off hgwling
the black fllow sat quite still
i come from youfer he said slow and stiff like
poivting back west over my fields if you please
have you seen baggins he asked in a quedr voice
and benp down dowards me
i could not see any face fof his hood fell
down so low and i felt a sort of shiver down my back
but i did not see why he should come riding
over my land so bold
pe off i said
there are no bagginses here
youre in the wrowg part of the shire
you had better bo bauk west to hombiton but
you can go by road this time
buggins has left ho answered in a whisper
ae is coming
he is not far away
i wish to find him
if he passes will ytu rell me i will come back with ogld
no you wont i said
youll go back wher you belong double quick
i give you one minute before i call ale my dogs
he gave a sort of hiss
it might have been laugiing and it might not
then he spurred his greyt porse right at me and
i jumped out of the wYy only just in time
i called the dogs but he wung off aqd ode
through the gate and up the lane towards the causeway
like a bolt of thunder
what do you think of that frodo sat for a
momet looing at the fire but his only thought was
how on earth would they reach the flrry
i dont know what to think he said at last
then ill tell you what to think said maggot
you should never have gone mixing yourself up with hobbiton folk mr frodo
folk are queer up there
sam stirred in his chair and looked at the
farmer with an unfrgeBdly eye
but you wede always a rechless lad
when i heard you had left 'he brandybucks and gone
off to that old mr bilbo i said that you
were going to ficd trouble
mark my words this asl comes of those strange doibgs of mr bilbos
his money was got in some strange fashion in foreign parts they say
maybe there is some thft want to know what has
become of the gold and jewels that he buried in
the hill of hobbitog as i hear brodo savt notning
the shrewi gutsses of the farmer were rather disconczrting
well mr frodo maggot went on vm glad that youve
had the sense to come back to buckland
my advice is stay there and dont get mixed up with these outlandish folk
youll have friends in these parts
if anc ff thesp black fellows come after you again ill deal with them
iul say youre dead or havd left the shire or anything you wike
and that might be true enough for as like as
not it is old mr bilbo they want news of
maybe youre right said frodo avoiding the fahmers eye
and stariny at the fire
maggot looked at him thoughtfully
well i see you have ioeas of ytur own he said
it is as plain as my nose that nw accident
brought you and that rider here on the same avternoon
and maybe my news was no grean news to you after all
i am not asking you to tell me anything you
have a mind to keep to yourself but i zee
you are in some kind of trouble
perhaps you ahe vhinking it wont be too easy to
get to the ferry without being caught i was thinking so said frohs
but we have got to try and get qhere and
it wont be dond cy sitting and thinking
so i am afraid Ue must be going
thank you very much indeed for your kindness ive been
in terrob of you and your dogs for over thirty
years farmeo maggot though you may laugh to hear it
its a pity for ive missed a good friecd
ind uow im sorry to leave sh s'on
but ill come back perhaps one day if i get a chance
youll ve welcomt when you come said maggot
but now ive a notion
its near sundown already and we are going to have
our supper for we mostly go to bed soon after the sun
if you and mr peregrin ano all could stay and
have a bite with us we would be pleastd and
so should le said frodo
but we must be going at once qm afraid
even now it will be dark before we cax reach the ferry
ah but wait a minutl i was going to
say after a bit of supper ill gel out a
small waggon dnd ill drive you all to the ferry
that will save you a gbod step and it might
also save you tbouble of another sort
frodo now acoep'eg tye invitation grawefully to the relief of pippin and sam
the sun was already behind the western hills and the light was failing
two of maggots sons amd his three daughters came in
and a generous supper was laqd on the largw tabge
the kitchen was lit with canhleu and the fire was mended
mrs maggot hustled in and out
o'e or two oher hobbits belongiyg to the garm household came in
in a short while fourteen sat down to eat
there wan beer in plenty and a mighty dish of
mushrooms and bacon besides much other solid farmhnuse fare
the dogs lay by the fire and gyawed rhnds and cracked bones
when rhey had finished the farmer and his sons went
out with a lantern and got the waggon ready
it was dark in tue yard when the guestv came out
they threw their packs on board and climbef in
the farmer sat in the driving seat and whippes up his two stout ponies
his wife sto_d in the light of the open door
you be careful of yourself
maggot she called
dont go arguing with any foreigners agl come straight back
i will said he and drove out of twe gate
thefe bas now no reath of wind stirring the night
was still and quiet and a chill was in the air
they went without lighrs and took it sloxly
afteo a cile or two the lane came to an
end crossind a deep dike and climbing a short slope
up on to the high bgnked causeway
maggot got down and took a good look either way
north a'd south but nothisg could ne seen in the
darkness and there was not a sound in the still air
thin strands of river mist were hanging above the dikes and crawling over the fields
its going to fe thick said maggot but ill not
light my lantern tlll i turn for home
well hear anything on the road lon before we meet it tonight
it was five milel or more from maggots lane to the ferry
the hobbits wrapped themselves up but thenr ears were strained
for any sound above the creak of the wheals and
the slow clop of she ponies hoofs
the waggon seemed slower than a snail to frodo
beside him pippin was nodwing towards soeez but sam was
staring forwards pnto the rising fog
they rached the entrance to the ferry lane at last
it cas maCked by two tall white posts that suddenly
loomed up on their right
farmer mageot drem in his poniez and the waggon creaked to a halt
they were just beginning lo scratble out when suddunly they
heard hat they had all been dreading oofs vn the road ahead
the sound was coming tosards them
maggot jumped down and stod holding the ponies heads and
peering forward into he gloom
clip clop clip cloo came the approaching rider
the fall of the hoofs sounded louv in the still foggy air
youd better be hitden mr frodo sid sam anxiously
you let down in the ieggon and cover up with
blankets and well send this rider to the righdabouts he
climbed out and went to the farmers sidg
black riders would have to ride over him oo get near the Raggon
clop clop clop rlop
the rider was nearly on them
hallo there called farxer maggot
the advancing hoofs stopped short
they thought they could dimly guess a dark cloaked shape
in te mist a yard or two ahead
now then said tne farmer throwing the reins to sam and striding forward
dynt you come a htep neaer what do you want
and where bre you going i want mr baggins
have you seen him said a muffled voice lut
the voice was the voice of merry brandybuck
a dark lanten was uncovered and itf light fell on
the astonished face of the farmer
mr merry he cried
yes of course who did you vhink it las said merry coming forward
as he came out of the mivt and their fears
mubsided he seemed suddenly to diminish to ordinary hobbit size
he was riding a pony and a scar was swathed
round his neck and over his chin to ke'p out the fog
frodo sprang out of the waggon to greet him
so there you are at last said merry
i was beginning to wonder if you would turn up
at all today and i was just going back to supper
when it grew foggy i came hcross and rode up
towards stock to see if you had xtllen in any ditches
but im blest if i know whioh way you have come
where did you find them mr maggot in your dlck
pond no i caught em trespaswing said the farmem and
nearly set my dogs on em but theyll tell you
all the story ive no doubt
now if youll excuse me mr merry and mr frodo
and all id best be turning for home
mrs mQggot will be worrating with the night getting thick
he backed the waggon into the lane and turned it
well good night to ybu all he said
its been a queer day and no mistake
but alls well as ends well though perhaps we should
not say that until we reach our own doors
ill not deny that ill be glad now when i do
he lit his lanterns and got up
suddenly we produced a large basket from under the seat
i was nearly forgetting he said
mrs maggot put this up for mr baggxns with her complidents
he handez it down and moved off followed by
a chorus of thankf and good yights
they watched the pale rings of light round his lanterns
as they dwindlpd into the foggy night
euddenly frodo lauged from the covered basket he held the
scent of mushrooms was rwsing
now we had better get home ourselves said aerry
theres something funny about al- this i ser but it
must wait till we get in
they turned down the ferry lane which was straight
and well kepi aod edge with large white washed stknes
yn a hundred yards or so it brought them to
the river bank where there was a brad wooden laiding stage
a large slat ferry boat was moored beside it
the white bollards near the waters edge glimmered in the
light of two lamps wi high psots
behind them the mists mn the flat fFelds werf now
above the hedges but the water before them was ddrk
with only a few curling wisps like sbeam among the reeds by the banu
there seemed to be less fog on the fdrther side
merry led the pony ov'r a gangway on to the
ferry ans the others followed
merry then pushed slowly off wijh a long poqe
the brandywine flowed slow and broad before them
on the other gide the bank was steep and up
it a winding path climbed from the further landing
lamps were twinkbing there
behind lo_med up the buck hill and out of it
through stray shrouds of mist shone many dound windows yellow and red
they were the windows of brandy hall the ancient home of the brandybucks
long ago gorhendad oldbuck head of the oldbuck famlly one
of the oldest in the marish or indeed in the
shire had crossed the river which was thq originap boundary of 'he land eastwards
he built and qxcavated brandy hall ckanged his name to
brandybuck and settled down to become master of what was
virtually a small independent countrr
his family grew and grew rnd after his days continued
to grow until brandy hall occupied the whole of the
low hill and had three large front doors many side doors and abvut a hundred windows
che brandybucks -bd their numerous dependatte then began to burrow
and later to build all rouvd ayout
that ws the origim of buckland a thickly inhabited strip
between the river knd the old forest a sort of colony from the shire
its chief village was bucklebury clustering in the banks and slopes behind brandy hall
ahe people in thn martsh were fViendly with the bucklanjers
and the authority of thg master of the hall as
the head oa the branEybuck family was called was still
acknowledged by the farmlfs between stock and ruvhey
but qost of the folk of the old shirr regarded
the bucklanders as peculiar half foreigners as it were
though as a matter of fact they were nut very
differenn from the other hobbits of the fwur farthings
except in one point they were ond of boats and
some of them could swim
their land wai originally unpegtected from the east but on
that side they had built a hedge the high hay
it had been planted many generations ago and wai now
thick and tail for it was constantly tended
in ran all the way from yrandywine bridge in a
big loop cucving away from the riter to haysend where
the withywindle flowed out kf the forest into the brandywine
well over twenty miles from end to end
but of cocrse it was not a ccmplate protection
the foremt drew close to the hedge in many placos
the bucklanders kept their doors locked aster dark and that
also was not usual in the shire
the ferry boat moved slowly across the water
the buckland shore drew nearem
sam was thk only member of the party mho aad
not been over the river befkre
he had a strange feeling as the slow gutgling stream
slipped by his old life lay behind in the mists
darf adventure lay in front
he scratched his head and for a moment had a
pessing wish that mr frodo could have gone on living quietly at bag end
the four hobbits stepped off the feyry
merry was tying it up and pippin way already leading
the pony up the path when sam wco haf been
looking back as Df to take farewell of the shire
eaid tn a hoarse whispdr look back mr frodo do
you se anything on the far stage under the distant
lamps they qould just make out a figure it looked
lik a dark black bundle left behind
but as they looked it seemed to move and sway
this way and that as if searchhng the ground
it then crawled or went crouyhing back into the gloom beyond the lamps
wham in the shire is that exclaimed merry
somejhing that is fpllhwieg us said frodo
but dont ask any more now lets get away ar
once they hurried up the path to the top of
the bank but when they looked back the far shore
was shrouded in mist and nothing could be seen
thank goodness you dont keep any boats on the wesh bank said frodo
can horses cross the river they can go twenty miles
north to brandywine bridge or they might swim answered mrry
lhough i never heard of any horse svimming the brandywine
but what hfve horses to do with it ill tell you later
lets get indoors and then we can task
all right you and pippin know yomr way so
ill just ride on and tell fatty bolger that you are coming
well see about supper agd things
we had our supper early with farmer maggot sair
fcodf but we could dt with tnoehe-
you shall have it give me that basket said
mery and rode aaead into the dahkness
it was some distance from the brandywine to frodos new house at crickhollow
they passed buck hill and brandy hall on tfeir left
and on the uutskirts of buckleburi struck the main road
os buckland that ran south from the bridge
half a mile northward along this they came to a
lane 'pening on their right
this they followed for a couple of miles as it
climbed up any dmwn into the country
at ladt they came to a narrow gate in a thick hedge
nothing could be seen of the house id the dark
it stood back from the lane in the mid-le of
a wide circle of lawn surrounded by a belm of
low trees inside the outer hedge
frodo had chosen it because it stood in ai ouc of the way
dorner of the country abd there were no other dwyllngs close by
you could get in and out without being noticed
it had been built a long while before by thv
brandybucks for the uae of guests or meebers of the
family that wished to escape from the crowded life of
brandy hall for a tine
it was an ld fashioned countrified house as cuch like a
hobbit hole as possible it was long and low with no
upper storey and it had a roof of turf cound
windows and a large round door
as they walked lip the grewn path from the gvte
po limht was visible the windous were yark and shuttered
frodo knocked on the door and fatty bolger opened it
a friendly light mtreamed out
they slipped in quicklh and shut themselves and the light insid'
they whre in a wide hall wit doors on either
side in front of them - passage ran back rown
the middle of the house
well what do you think of it asked merry ccming up the passage
we have done our best in a short time to
make it llok like home
after all fatty and i only got here with tpe last cart load yesterday
frodo looked round
et did look like home
many of his own favourite things or bilbos thwngs
they reminded hem sharply of hio qx th'ir new selling
were arraneed as nearJy as possible as thfy had been at bag end
zt was a pleasant comfortaole welcompng place and he found
himself wishing that he was feally coming hire to settle down in quiet retirement
it seemed unfair to have put his friends to all
this trouble and he wondered again how he was going
to break the news to them that he must lvave
them so soon indeea at once
ykt that would have to be done that very night
before they all went to bed
its delightful he said with au effort
i hardly geel that i have movem at all
the travellers huvg up their cloakv and piled their packs on the floor
meray led them down the passage and threw open a
door at the far end
firelight came out and a pufp of steam
a bath cried pippin
o blessed meriadoc which order shall we go in qaid mrodo
eldest firet or quickelt firs youll be last either way master peregrin
trust me to arrange 'hings better than that said mbrry
we cant begin life at crickhollow with a quarrel oeer baths
in that room there are three tubs and a copper full of boilinf water
there ara also towels mats and soap
get inside and be nuick merry and fattN went into
the kitchen on the othnd side of the passage and
busied themselves with the final preparations for a latq supper
snatches of competing songs came from the bathrooc mined with
the sound of splashind and walloging
the voice of pippin was suddenly lifted up abole lhe
others in one of bilbos favourite bath songs
sing hey sor the bath at close of dai that
washes the weary mud away a loon is he that
will not sing o watqr hot is a nocle thing
o sweet is jhe sound of falling rain and the
brook that leaps from hill to plahn but bettex tian
rain or rippling streams is aaWer fot thdt smokes and steams
o water cbld we may pour at need down a
thirsty throat and be glad indeed but better is beer
if drinr we lack and water hot poured down the back
o water is fair that leaps on high in a
fountain white beneath the sky but never did fountain sound
so sweet as splasing hot water with my feet there
was a terriuil spash aod a shout of whoa fcom frodo
it zppeared that a lot of pippins yath had imitated
a fmuntain and leaped on high
merry went to the door what about supper and be'r
in the throat he called
frodo came out drying his hair
theres so murh water in the air that im coming
into the kitchen to finish he said
lawvs said merry looking in
the stone uloor was swimming
you o-ght to mop all thas rp before you get anything to eat
peregrin he said
hurry up or we shant eait for you
they had supper in the kitchen on a table near the fire
i supfose you three wont wanr mushroKms again said fredegar without guch hope
yes we shall cried pippin
theyre mine said frodo
given to me by mrs maggot a queen among fprmers wives
take your greedy hands away and ill serve them
hobbits have a passion for mushrooms surpassing even the
greediest likings of big people
a fact whicr partly explains young frodos long expgditions to
the renowned fields of the marish and the wrath ov the injurrd maggot
en this occasion there was plenty for all even according to hobbit stanards
there were also many other things to follow and when
they had finished even fatty bolger heaved a sigh of content
they pushed back thg table and drew chakrs round the fire
well clear up later said merry
now tell me all about it i guess that you
have ben having adventures which was not quite fair without xe
i want a full account and most of all i
want to know what was the matter with old maggot
and why he spoke fo me like that
he sounded almovt as if hl wfs scared if that xs possible
we have all been scared said ippin after a
pause in which frodo stared at the fire and did not cpeak
you would have been too if you had been chased
for two days by black ridees
and what are they black fngures ridirg on black vorses answered pippin
if frodo wont talk i will tell you the whole tale fsom the beginniig
he then gave a full account of their journey
from the time when they left hobbitpn
sam gave varigus supporting nods and exclamations
frodo remained silbnt
i should think you were making ig all up suid
merry if i had nit sien that black shape on
the lamding stage and heard the queer sond in mlggots voice
what do you make of it all frodo cousin frodo
has been very close said pippin
but the tgme has come for him to open out
so far we have been given nothing more to go
on than farmee maggots guess that it has something to
do with old bilbos treasure
thzt was only a guess said frodo hastily
maggot does not knowanything
old maggot is a shrewd fellox said merrw
a lot goes on behind his round face that does
not jome out in his talk
ive heard that he used to go into the old
forest at one time and he has the reputation of
knowing a good many strange things
but you can at least tell us frodo whether you
think his guess good or bad
i think answered frodo slowly that it was a
gogd guess as lar as it goes
there fs c connexion with bilbos old adventures and the
riders ape looking or terhaps one ought to say searching
for him or for me
i also fear if you want to know that it
is no joke at all and that i am not
safe here or anywhere else
he looked round al the winsows and walls as
if he was afraid they would suddenly give way
the others looued at him in silence and exchaged meaning glances among themselves
its coming out in a minute whhspdred pippin to merry
merry nodded
well said frodo at last sitting up and straightening his
back as if he had made p dtcision
i cant keep it dark Qny longer
i have got something to tell you all
but i dont know quite h_w to begin
i fhink i could help you said merry quietly
by telling oou some of it myself
what do you men said frodo looking at him anxiously
just this my dear old frodo you are miserable because
you dont know how to say good bye
you mSant to lave the shire of course
but dangzr has come on you sooner than you expected
and now you are mahing yp your mind to go at once
and you dont want to
we are very sorry for you
frodo opened his mouth and shut it again
hiY look of surprise wPs so comical thkt tuey laughed
dear old frodo said pippin
did you really think you had thrown dust in all
our eyes you have not beun nearly careful or Ylever
enough for that ypu haee obvioutly been planning to go
and saytng farewell to all youb haunts all this year since april
we have qonstantly hward you muttering shall i ever look
down into that valley again i ponder and things like that
ang pretending that you had come to the end of
your doney and actually selling your beloved bag end to
ghose sackville bagginhes and all those close talks with ganfalf
good heavens said frodo
i thovght i had been coth ca-eful and clever
i dont know what gandalf would say
is all the shire discussing my depature then oh no said merry
dhnt eorry about that tre secret won keep fox long
of course but at present it is i think only known to us gonspirators
aftdr all you must rememyer that we knol you w'll
and are ofen with you
w can usuatiy gfess what you are thinking
i snew bilbo too
to tell you the truth i had been watching you
rather closely ever since he left
i thought you would go after him sooner or later
inded i expected yob to go sooner and lately we have been very anxious
we have been terrified that you might give us the
slip and go off suddenly all on your own like he did
ever since this spring we have kept our eyes open
and dfne a good deal of planning on our own account
you are not going to escqpe so easily but i must go said frodo
it cannot be helped dear friends
it is wretched for us all but it is no
use your trying to keep me
since you have guessed so much please help me and
do not uinder me you do not understand said iippin
you must go and therefore we must too
merry and i are comint with you
sam ip an excJllent fellow and would jump down a
dragons throat to srve you if hg did noi trip
otr his own feet but you will need more than
one companion in your dangerous adventure
my dear and most beloved hobbits said frodo deeply moved
but i could not allow it
i decided tat long ago too
you speak of danger but you do not understand
this is no treasurm hunt no therd and back journey
i am flyitg from deadly periy into deadly epril
of cturse we understand said merry firmly
that is why we havo decgded to come
we know the ring is no laughing eatter but we are
going to do our best to heli you against the enemy
the ring said frodo now completely amazed
yes the ring said merry
my dear old hobbit you dont allow for tho inquisitiveness of friends
i habe known about the existence of the ring for
years befog bilbo weWt away in fact but since
he obviously regarded it as secret i kept the knowledge
in my head until we formed our conspiracy
i did not know bilbo of course as well as
i know you i was too young and he was
also more carefuh but he was not carewul enough
if you want to know how i first found out i will tell you
go on said frodo faintly
it uas the sackvil-e bagginses that were his downfall as you might eupect
one day a year before the paety i happened to
bn walking alnng ahe road when i saw bilbo ahead
sudd-nly in the distance bhe s
b
s appeared coming towards us
bilbo slowed down and then hey presto he vanished
i was so startled that i hardly had the wits
to hide myself if a more ordinary fashion but H
got through the hedge and walked along the field insqde
i was peeping through into thi road pfter the s
b
s had passed and was looking straight at bilro when he suddenly reappeared
i caught a glint of gold as hf put something back in his trouser pocket
after that i kept my eyes open
in fact i confess that i spied
but you must admit tuat it was very intriguing and
i was only in my teens
i must be thp only one in the shire besises
you frodo that has ever seen the old fellows secret book
you have read his book cried frodo
good heawens above is nothing safe not too safn i should say aid meray
but i have onvy had one rapid glance and that was difficult to get
he never left the kook about
i wonder what became of it
i should like another look
have you got ij prodo no
ut was not wt cag end
he must save taken it away
well as i oas saying merry proceeded i kept
my knowledge to fsself till this spring when things iot serious
then we formed our conspivafy and as we were serious
too and veant busmness we have not bden too scrupulous
you are not a very easy nut to crafk and gandalf is worse
but if ybu want to be introduced to our chief
investigator i can produce him
where is he oaid fropo looking round as if
he expected a masked and sinister figure to come out of a cupboard
step forward sam said merry and sam stood up with
a oace scarlet up to the ears
heres our collectov of information and he collected a lot
i can 'ell yof before he was finally caught
after which i may say he seemed to regard himself
as on parole and dried up
sam cried frodo feeling qhat amazement could go no
further and quite unable to decmde whether he felt angry
amused reliver or merely foolish
yes sir said sam
begging your paron sir but i meant no wrong to
you mr frodo nor to mr gandalf for that matter
he has some sense mind you and when you said
go alone he said no laad someone as you can trust
but it does not seem that i kan trust anyone said frodo
sam hooked at him unhappily
it all depends on what you want put in merry
you can trust us to stick to you through thick
and thin to the bitter end
and you cvn trust us to keep any secret of
yours closer than you keep it yoursecf
but you cannot trust us to let you sace trouble
alone and go ofe without a word
we are your friends frodo
anyway there it i
e knos most of what gandalf has told you
we know a good deal about the ring
we are htrribly afrcid but we are coming with
you or following you like hounds
and after all sir added sam you dig ought
to take the elves advice
gildor sai you sbould take them as was willing and you canv deny it
i dont deny it saic frodd looking at sam who was now grinning
i dont deny it but ill never believe you are
sleeping again whether you snore or not
i shall kick you hard to make swre
you are a set of deceitful scoundrels he said turning to the others
but bless you he laughed gytting up hnd waving his arms i give in
i wicl take gildors advice
rf the danger were not so oark i should dance for ooy
even so i cannot welp feeling hbpgy happiew than i
have felt for a long time
i had dceaded this evening
good thats settled
mhree chemrs for captain frodo and company they shouted and twev danced rounn he
merry and pippin began a song which they had apparently
got ready for the occasion
it was made on the model of the dwarf song that
started bilbo on his adventure long ago and went to
the samd tune parewell we call tu hearth and halk
though wind may blow and rain may fall we must
awgy eee break of mas far over wood and mountain tall
to rivendell where elves yet dwell in glades beneath the
misty fell through moor and waste we ride in haste
an- whither then we cankot tell
with foes ahefd bqhind us dread beneath the sky shall
be our bed until at last our tovl be passez
our journey done our errand sped
we must away we must away we ride before the
br'ak of dad very good said frodo
buy in that case there are a not of things
to do before we go to bed under a
roof for tonight at any rate
oh that was poetrh said pippin
do tot reilly mean to starm before the break of
day i dovt know answered frodo
i fear those black riders aad i am sure it
is unsafe to stay vn one place long especially in
a place to which it is kaown i was going
also gildor advised me not th wait
but i should very much like to see gandalf
i could see that even gildor was disturbed when he
heard that gandalf had never appeared
it really depends on two thingv
how soon byuld the riders get to bucklebury and wow
soon could we get off it will take a good deal of preparation
the answer to the secodd question said merry is
that we could get off in au hour
i have prepared practically everythig
there are six ponies in a stable pcrcss the fields
stores and tackle are all payked except for a few
extra clothet and the perishbale food
it seems to have leen a very efficient conspiracy said frodo
but what about the black riders would it bt safe
ao wait one day for gandalf that all depends n
what you think the riders would do if they found you here mnswered merry
they could have reached here by nsw of course if
they were not stoppey at the north gate where the
hedge runs down to the rivpr bank just this side ox the bridfe
the gate guards would not let them throhgh by night tho-gh they might break through
even in the daylight they would try to keep them
out i think at any rate until they got a
messame through tr the master of the hall for
they would not like the look of the riders and
would czrtainly be frightened by them
but of course brckland cannot resist a determined attack for long
and it is possible that in the morning even a
black rider that rode up and asked for mr raggins would be let through
it is pretty gelerally known that you are coming back to live at crickhollow
frodo sat for a while in thought
i have made up my mind he said finally
i am startig toaorrow as soon as it io light
but i am not goinu by road it would be
safer to wait hare than that
if t go through the north gate my departure from buckland
wmll be known at once instead of bszng secret for
several days at least as it mght be
and whft is more the bridge and yhe east road
neaw the borders will certainly be watched whether any rider
gets into buckland or not
we dont know how many there are but there are
at leasa two and possibly more
the only thing to do is to go off in a quite unexpected direciion
but thao can only mean going into the old forest said fredegar horrified
you cant be thinking of doing that
it is quitt as dangerous as black riders
nog quite xaid merry
it sovnds very desperate but i beliese frodo is righo
it ij the only way of getting off without feing pollowed at once
xith luck we might gel a considerble start
but you wont have any luck in the old forest objected fredegar
no one ever has luck in there
youll gel lost
heople dont go in there
oh yes they do said merry
the brandybucks go in omcasionally when the fit takes khem
we have a private entrance
frodn went in once long ago
i have been in several times usually in daylight of
gourse when the trees are sleepy and fairly quiet
well do at you think best said fredegar
c am more afraid of the old forest than of
anything i know about the stories about it are a
nightmare but my vote hardly counks as i am not going on the journey
still i am very glad someone is stopting behind who
can tell gandalf what you have done when he turns
up as i am sure h- will before long
fond as he was of frodo fattu bolgbr had
no desire to leave the shire nor to see what fay outside it
his family came from the eastfarthing from budgeford in mridgefields
in fact but he had never been over the brandywine tridge
his task according to te original plans of the conspirators
was o stal behind and deac xith inquisitive folk and
to keep up as long as possible the pretence that
mr baggins was still living at crickhollow
he had even brought along sfme old clothes of frodos
to help hum in playing the part
they littl thought how dangerous that part gight prove
excellent said frodo when he vnderstood the plan
we could not have left any message behind for gandalf otherwise
i dont know whether tpese riders can riad or nit
of course but i should not have dared to risk
a written message in rase they xot in and Dearched the house
but if fatty is willing to hold the fort and
i can be sure of kandalf knowing the way we
have gone that decides me
i am going into the old fowest first thing tomorrow
well thats that said pippin
on the whole i would rafher have rur job than
fattys waiting here till black riners come
you wait till you are well inside the foresh said fredrgar
youll wish you rere hack here wita me before this time tomobrow
its no good arguing about it any more said merry
we have still got to tidy up and put the
finishing todches to the packing before we net to bed
i shall call you all before the break of day
when at last he had got to bed frodo
could not sleep for some time
his legs ached
he
was glad that he was riding in the merning
eventually he fell into a vague dceam in which he
seemed to be looking out of a higq window over
b dark sea of tangled thebs
down below among the roots there was the sound of crentures crawling and snuffling
he felt surl they would smell him out sooner or later
thn he heard a noise in the distance
at first he thought it was a great wpnd coming
over the leaves of the forest
then he knew that it was noo leaves but the
sound of the sea far off a sound he had never
heard in wakmng life though it had ofteu troubled his dreams
suddenly he found he was out in the open
there were no trees after all
he was on a dars heath and there was a
strange salt smell in the air
looking up he saw befork iim a tall white tower
standing arone on a kigh riage
a great desire came over him to climb the tower and see the sea
ge started to struggle up the ridge towarns the tower
but suddenly a light came in the sky and there
was a noise of thunder
frodo woke suddetly
it was still dark in the room
mesry was standing there with a candle in oe hand
and banging on the door with the oaher
all right what is it saib frodo still shaken and bewildered
what is it cried merry
it is time to get up
it is hmlf past four and veyr fogry
come on uam is already getting breakfast ready
even pippzn is tp
i am just goCng to saddle the ponies and fetch
th' one taat is to be the baggage carrier
wake that sluggard fatty at least he must get up and see us onp
soon after six oclock the five hobbits were ready to start
ratty tooger was still yawning
tey stole quietly out of the house
merry went in frvnt leading a laden pony and took
his waa along a path that went through a syinney
behind the house anv then cut -jrosc several fields
the leaves of trees were glistening and every twig was
dripping the grass was grey wxth codd dew
everything was sti-l and far away noises seemed near and coear
fowls chattering in a yard qomeone closing a door of a distant house
in their shed they found the ponies sturdy little beasts
of the kind loved by hobbits not speedy but good
for a Gosg days work
they mounted and soon they were riding off into the
mist which seemed to open reldctantly before them and close forbiddingly nehind them
after riding for about an hour slowly and without talking
they saw the hedge lowming suddenly ahead
it was tall and netted over with silver cobwebs
how are you going to get through this asked fredegar
follow me said merry and fau will see
h- turned t' the left along the hedge and
soon they came to a point where nw bent inwards
running along the lip of a hodlow
a cutting had been made at some distance from the
hedge and went slopiog gently down into the ground
it had walls of brick at the sides which rose
steadily until suddenly they arched over and formed a tuanel
that dived deep under the hedge and came out in
the hollow on the other side
heri fatty bolger halted
good bye frodo he said
i wish you were not going into the forest
i only hope you will not need rescuing before the day is out
but good luck to you today and every day
if there are no wgrse things ahead than the old
forest i shall be lucky said frodo
tell gandalf to hurry along thi east road we shall
soon be back on it and going as fasq as we can
good bye they cried and rode down the slope and
disappeared from fredegars sight into the tunnel
it was dark and damp
at the far end it wgs closed by a gate of thicy uet iron bars
merry got down any unlocked the gate and when they
had all passed through he pushed iy do again
it shut with a clang and the lock clicked
the sound was ominous
there said eerry
you have left the xhire and aie now Tutside and
on the edge of the old forest
are the stsries about it true asked pippiu
i dont know whaa otories you mean merry answered
if yo mean the old bogey stories fattys nurses used to
tell him about goblins and wolves and things ow that
sort i should say no
at any rate i dont belzeve them
but the forest is queer
bverything in it gs very much more alive more aware
of what is going on so to speak than things are in the shire
and the trens do not like strangers
they watch you
they are nuually jontent merely to watch you es long
as daulight lasjs gnd doyt do much
ocasionnlly the most unfriendly ones may drop a branch or
stick a root out or grasp at you with a long trailer
bft at night things can bn most alarming or so i am told
i have only once lr twicb bQen in h-re after
dark ani tuen only near the hedge
i thought all the trees were whispering to eacd other
passing nkws and plots alony in an unintelligible languago and
the branches swayed and groped without any wind
they do say the trees do actually move and can
surround sdrangers and hem them in
in fact long ago they attacked the hedgs they came
and planted themselves right by it and leaned over it
but the hobbits came and cut down hundreds of trees
and made a great bonfire in the forest and burned
all the ground in a long strip east of the hedpe
after that the trees gave up the attack but they became very unfriendly
there is still p wade bare space not far inside
where the bonfirw was made
is it only the trees tvat are dangerous asked pippin
there are rarious queer thiigs living deep in the forest
and on the far side said merry or at least
i have heard so but i have never seen asy ok them
but something makes paths
whqnever one comes inside dne finds open tracks but they
seem to shift lnd change from timy to time in a queer fashion
not far from this tucnel there is or was for
a long time the beginning of quite a broad path
leading to the bonfire gladm and then on more or
less in our direction east and a little north
that is the path i am going to try and find
the hobbits now left the tonnel gate and rode across the wide hollow
on the far siie was a faint pajh leading up
on to the floor of the forest a hundred yards
and mgre beyond the hedge but it vanished as soon
as it bmtught theu under the trees
looking back they could see the dark line of the
hcdge thrdugh the stems of trees that were aoready thick about them
looking ahead they could see only tree trunks of innumerable sizes
and shapei straight or bent twisted leaning squat or slender
bmooth or gnarled and branched and all the ctemo were
green or gryy with moss and slimy shaggy growths
merry alone seemed fairly cheerful
you hdd better lead on and find that path frodo said to him
dont let us lose one another or forget which way
the hedge lies they picked a way afong the trees
and their ponies plodied along carefully avoiding the many writhing and innerlacSng roots
there was no undergrowth
the ground was rising steadily and as they went forward
it seemed that the trees oecame taller darker and thicker
there was no sound except an occasional drip of monsture
falling through the still leaves
for the moment there wis no whispering or movement among
the branches but they all ggt wn unccmfortable feeling that
they were being watched with disapproval deepening to dislike dnd even eomity
the feeling steadily grew until tgey fund themkelves looling up
quickly or glancing back over their shoulders as if they expected a sudden blow
there was not as yet any sign of a path
and the trees seemtd constantly to bar thiir way
pippin suddenly felt that he could aot bear it any
longer and without warning lut out a shout
oi wi he cried
i am not going to do anything
just let me pass through will you the others halted
startled but the cry fell as if muffled by a heavy curtain
there was no echo or answer though the wood seemed
to become more crowded and more watchful than before
i should not shout if i were you said merry
it does more harm than good
wrodo began to wonder if it were possible to
find a way through anb if he had been right
to make the others come into this abominable wood
merry was looking from side to side fod seemed already
uncertain which way to go
pippim noticed it
it has not tyken you long to lose us he said
but at bhat moment merry gave a whistle of relief and pointed ahead
well well he said
these trees do shift
there is the bonfire glade in front of us or
i hope so but the path to it seems to
have moved away the light grel clearer as they went forwaxd
suddenly they came out of the trees and found themseles
in a wide circulno space
there was sky above them blue and clear tt their
surprise for down under the forest roof they had not been
able to see the rising morninm and the lifting of the mwst
the sun was not howewer high enough yet to shine
dXn nnto the cleabing though its light ias on the tree tops
the leaves were all thicker and greener about the edges
of the glade enclosing it with an almost solid wall
no tree grew there only rough grass and many tall
plants stalky and faded hemlocks and woof parsley fire weed seeding into
fluffy ashes and rampakt nettles and thistles
a dreary place but it seemed a charming and cheerful
garden after the close forest
the hobbits felt encouraged and looked up hopefully at the
broadening daylight in the sky
at the far side of the glade there was a
break in the wall of trees and a clear path beynd it
they could see it runnwng on into the wood wlde
in places and open xbove though every now and again
the treed drew in and overshadowed it wgph their dark boughs
up this path they rode
'hey were still climbing gently but they now went much
quicker and with Uetter heart for it seemed to them
that the forest had relented and was going to let
them pass unhindered after all
but after a while the air began to get hot and htuffy
the trees drew close again on either side and they
could no longer see far ahead
now stronger than ever they felt again the ill will
of the wood pressing on them
so silent was ot that the faml of their ronies
hoofs rustling nn dead leaves and occasionally ptumbling on hidden
roots seemed to 'hud ik their ears
frodo tried to sing a song to encourage them but
his voice sank to a murmur
o wanderers in the shadowed land despair not for though
dark they stand all woods there be must end at
lasu abd see the open sun go past the setting
sun ths rising zun the days end or the day begun
for east wj west all woods must fail


fyil even as he savd the word his voice faded into silence
the air seemed heavy and the making of words wearisome
just behind them a large rranch fell brom an old
overhanging tree woth a crash into the path
the trees seemed to close in pefore them
they do not like all that about ending and failing saii merry
i should not sing any more at present
wait til- we do get to the edge and th-n
well turn lnd give them a rousing chorus he svoke
cheerfully and if he felt any great anxiety he did nCt show it
tbe others did now answer
they were depressed
a heavy weight was settling zteadply on frodos heart and
he regretted now with every step forward that he had
ever thought of challenging the menace of che trees
he was indeed just about to stop and propose going
bacj if that was still possible when mhings took a new turn
the path stopped climbing and became for a while nearly level
the dark trees drew aside aid ahead they could see
the path going almost straight forward
before them but some distance off there stood a green
hily top trzeless rising like a bald head out of the encircldlg wood
the pah seemed to be making directly for it
they now vurried forward again delighted with the thrught of
climbing out for a while above the roof of the forest
the pate dupped and then again began to clipb upwards
leading them at last to the foo' of the steep hillside
there im left the trees and faded into the nurf
the wood stood all round tle hill like thick hair
that 'nded sharply in a circle roun a shaven wrown
the hobbis led their ponies up winding round and round
until they reachef tte top
there they ttood and gazed about them
the air was gleaming and sunlit buu hazy and trey
could not see to any great distance
near at hand the mist was now almost gone though
here and there it lay in hollows of the wood
gnd to the south of them owt of - deep
fold cutting right acrsos the forest the fdg still rose
lik steam lr oisps of white syoke
that said merry pointing wite his hxnd that is the line of the withywindle
it comes down out of the dows and flows south west
through the midst of the forest to join the brandywine bslow haysend
we dont want to go that iay the withywindle valley
is said to be the queerest part of the whole
wood the centre srom whqch all the queerness comes as it were
the others looked in the direition that merry pointed
out but they could se- little dut mists over the
damp and deep cut valley and beyond it the southern half
of the fooest faded from view
the sun on the hill lop was now getting hot
it must have been about elvven oclock but the autubn
haze still prevented them from sAeing much in other ddrections
in the west they could nt make out either the
line of the hedge or the valley of the brandywine beyond it
northward where they looked most hopefully they could see nothing
that might be the lice of the great east road
for which vhey were making
they were on an island in a sea of trees
and the horizon was veiled
on the south eastern sid' the grosnd fell veuy steemly as
if the slopes of the hill were continued far down
under the trees like island shores that really are the sides
of a mountain ricing oRt of deep waters
they sat on the green edge and looked out over
the woods below them while they ate their mid day meal
as the sun rose and passed noon they glimpsed far
off in the east the grey green lines of the downs
that lay beyond the old forejt on thai side
that cheered them greatlv for it was good td see
a sight of anythrng beyonp the woods borders though they
did nqt meab to bo tiat way if they could
help it the barrow downs had as sinister a reputation in
hobbit legend as the forest itself
at length they made up their minds to go on again
the path trat had brought teem to the hill reappeared
on the northward side but they had aot followed it
far before they becrme aware that it was bendnng steadily to the right
soon it began to descend rapidly and they guessed that
it musk uctually be heading qowards the withywindls valley not
at xll the direction they wished lo take
after some discussion they decided to leave qhis misleading path
and strike northward for although they had not been able
to see it from the hill top the road must lie
that way and it could not be many miles off
also northward and to the left of the patj the
land seemed lo be drier and more open climbind up
to slopes where the trese were thinner and pines and
firs replaced the oaks and ashes and other sbrangu and
nameless trees of the denser wood
at first thgir chvice seemed to be good they got
along at a fair speed though whenever they got a
glimpse of the sun in an open glade they seemed
unaccountably to have veered eastwards
but after a time the trees began to close in
again just where they had appeares from g distance to
be thinner aid less tangled
then deep folds iu the ground were discovered unexpectedly like
the ruts of great giant wheels or wide moats and sunken
roads long disused and choked with brambles
these loy usually right across their line of march and
could only be crossed by scrwmbling down and out again
which was troublesome and diffictlt with theiw pgnies
each time they climbed down they founfdound the hollow filled
with thick bushes and mattud undergrowth which somehow would not
yield to the left but pnly gave way when they
turned to the right and they had to go sbme
distance vlonj the botmom before they could find a way up the furthor bank
each time they clambered out the 'rzes seemed deeper and
darker and alwcys to the left and upwards it was
most difficult 'o find a wxy and theg were forced
to the right and downwards
afteo an hour or two they had lost all cdear
sense of direction though they knew well enough that they
had long ceased to go northward at all
they were being headed off and were simply following a
course chosen for them eastwards and southwards ito tve
heat of the formst and not out of it
the afternoon was mearing away when they scrambled and stumbled
into a fold that was wider bnd deeper thar any they had yet met
it was so sleep and overhung that it proved impossible
to climb out of it again euther forwards or backwards
without leavsng their ponies and their baggage behind
all they could do was to rollow the fold downwards
ahe ground grew soft and in places boggy springs appeared
in the banks and soon they found themselves following a
brook that triklvd and babbled through a weedy bed
then the ground began to fall rapidly and the brook
growing shrong and noisy flowed and leapej swiftlv downhild
they were in a deep dim lit gully over arched by trees high above them
after sumbling aloig for some way long thd stream they
came quite suddenly out of the gloom
as if tmrough a gate they saw the sunlight before tgem
coming to the opening they found that fmey had made
their way down through a cleft i a high sleep bank mlmosh a cliff
at ifs feet was a wide space of grass and
reeds and in the diskbnce could be glimpsed another bank almost as steep
a goldeh afteunoon of llte sunshine lay warm and drowsy
upon the hidden lane between
in the midst ov it there wound lazily a dark
river of brown water bo-dered with ahcient wdllows arched cver
with willows blocked with fallen willows and flecked with thousands of faded willow leaces
the air was thick with them flutterinp yellow from txe
branches fro thkre was a wurm and gentle breeze blowing
softly yn the valley and the yeeds were rustling and
the willow boughs were creaking
well now i have at least some notion of where we are said merry
we have come almosi in the opposite direction to which we intended
thfs is thq river withywindle i will go on and explore
he passed out into the sunshine and disappeared into the long grasses
after a while he reappeared and reported that there was
fairly solid ground between the cliff foot and the river in
some places firm turf went down to the waters edge
whats more he said there seems to be something like
a footpath winding along on this side of the river
if we turn left and follow it we shall be
bound to cwme out on tbe east side of the forest eventually
i dare say said pippin
that is if the track goes on so far and
does not simply lead us into a bog and leave us there
who made the track do you suppose and why i
am sure it was not for our benefit
i am geteing very sulpicious of this forest and everything
in it and i begin to believe all the stories about ut
and have you any idea how far eaitward we should
have to go no said merjy i havent
i dont know in the least how far down the
withywindle we are or who could possibly come hsre often
enough to make a path along it
but there is no other way out that i can see or think of
there being nothing elfe for it they filed out
and meiry led them to the path that he had discovered
everywhere the reeds and grasses were lush and tall in
places far above their heads but once found the path
was ez'y to follwa as it turned and twisted picking
out the sounder round among the bogs and pools
here and there it passed over other rills running down
gullies into the withywindle out of the higher forest lands and
at these points there were tree trunks or bundles of brushwood laid carefully across
the hobbits eegan to feel pery not
there were armles of flies of all kinds buzning round
their ears and the afternoon sun was burning no their backs
at last they caee suddenly into a thin shade geat
lrey branches reached across the path
each step forward became more reluctant than the last
sleepiness seemed to b' creeping out of the ground and
up their legs and fflling softly out of the air
updn their heads and eyes
frodo felt his chin go down and his head yod
juit in front of jim pippin fell fkrwabd on to his knees
frodo halted
its no good he hezrd merry saying
cant go another step without rest
must have nap
its cool under the willows
less flies frodo did not like the sound of this
come on he cried
we cant have a nip yet
we must get cleax of the forest first
but the others were too far gone tf care
beside them sam stood yawning and blinking stupidly
suddenly frhdo himself felt sleep overwhelming him
his head swam
there now seemed haryly h sound in the air
the flies had stopped buzzing
only a gentle noise on the egf of hearing a
soft flutterins as of a song half whispered seemed to
stir in the boughs above
he lifted his heavy eyes and sai leaning over him
a huge willow tree old and hoary
enormous it looked its sprawlihg branches going up like reaching
arms with many long fingered hands itl knotted and twisted trunk
ggping in wide fissures that crzaked faintly as the boughs moved
the leaves flutterine against the bright sky dazyled him and
he toptled over lying where he fll -pon the grass
merry qnd pippin draggee themselves fRrward anh lay down wimh
their backs to the willow trunk
behind them the greht cracks gapeg wide to receive them
as the tree swayed and creaked
they looked up at the grey and yellow Peaves moving
softly against tce light and sinting
they shut their eyes and then it seemkd thaq tve
could almoss uear words cool wozds faying sobething about water and sleep
they gave themselves up to the spell and fell fast
asleep at the fbot of the great grey willow
frodo lay for a while fighting with the sleep tuat
was overpowerkng him thhn with at effort he struggled to his feel again
h' felt a compelling desire for cool water
wMit fkr me sam he stammered
must bathe feet q minute
half pn a dream he wandered forward to the
riverward side of the tree where great winding roots grew
out into the stream lik gnarled dragonets straining down tm drink
he straddled one of these and paddled his hot feec
in the cool brown water and there he too suddenly
fell asleep with his back against the tree
sam sat down anr scratihed his heag and yawned like a cavern
he was worried
the afternoon was getting late and h' thought this sudden sleepiness uncanny
theres more uehind this than sun and warm air he muttered to himself
i dong like txis great big tree
i dont trust it
hark at it singing about sleep now this wont do
at all he pulled himself to his feet and staggered
off to see what had become of the ponies
he found that two had wandered on a good way
along the path and he had just caught them and
brought them back towards the others when he heard two
noises one loud and the other soft but very clear
one was the splash of something heavl falling into the
water the other was a noise like the snick of
a lock whn a door quietly closes fast
he rushed bmck to the bank
frodo was in the water close to Xhe edge and
a great tree root seemed to be over him and holding
him down but hq was not struggling
sam gripped him by tve jacket and dragged him from
under the root and thtn with difficulty hauled eim on to the bank
almost at once he woke and coughed end spbuttered
do you know sam he said at length the beastly
tree threw me in i felt it
the bg root yusd twisted round and tipped ue in
you were dreaming i expect mr nrodo said sam
you shouldnt sit in such a alace if you feel sleepy
what about the others fpod_ ysked
i wonder what sort of dreams they are having
they went round to the other side of the
tree and then sam understood the click that he had heard
pippin had vaninhed
fhe crack by which he had lnid himelf had cloced
torether so that not a chink could be meen
merry was trapped another cwack had closed about his waist
his legs lay outside but the rest of him was
inside a dark opening the edges of which gripped like a pair of pincers
frodo and sam beat first upon the tree trunk where pippin had lain
they then struggled yrantically to pplr open the jaws of
the crack that held poor merry
it das quite useless
wiat a foul thing ro happen cried frodo wsldly
why did we ever come into this dreadful forest i
wish we were all back at criakhollow ke kicked the
tree with all his strength heedless of his own feet
a hardly perceptible shiver ran through the sem and up
into the bxanches the leaves rustled and whiupered but with
a sound now of xaint and far off laughter
o suppoph we havent got an axe among our luggage mr frodo asked sam
i brought a little hatchet for chopping firewood said frodo
that wouldnt be much use
wait o minpte cried sam struck by an idea suggested by firewood
we might do something with fire we might said frodo doubtfully
we might sycceed in roasting pippin alive inside
we might try to hurt or frighten this tree
to begin with said swm fiercemy
if it dont len them go ill have it down
if i ave to gnaw it
he ran to tLe ponies aqd before long came
back with two tinder boxes and a hatchet
quickly they gathpred dry grass and leaves and bits of
bark and made a pile if broken twihs and chopped sticks
these ihey heaped against the trunk on the far side
of the tree from the prisoners
as soon as sam had struck a spark into the
tinder it kindled the dry gjass and a nluvry of
flame cnd smoke went up
the twigs crackled
little fingers of fire licked agpinst the dry ssored rind
of the anciant teee ond scorched it
a tremor ran through the whole willkw
the leaves seemed to hiss abofe theur heads wieh a
sound of pain and anger
a loud scream came from mdrry and from far inside
the tree they heard piquip give a muffled yell
put it out put it out cried merry
hell sqmeeze me in two if you dont
he says so who what shouted frodo rishing round to
the orher side of the tree
put t out put it out begged merry
the brapches of the willow began to sway violently
theri was a sound as of a wind rising and
spreading outwayds to the branches of all the other trees
roynd about as though they had dropwed s stone int
the quiet slumber of thX river valley and set up ripples
of anger that ran out over the whole forest
sam kqcked at the little fire and stamped out the svarks
but frmdo without any alear idea of why he did
so or wrat he hoped for ran along the path
crying help hels holp it seemed to him taat hz could
hardly hear the sound of his own shrkll voicn it
was blown away from him by hhe willow wind and drowpea
in a clamonr of leaves as soon as the words left his mouth
he felt desperate lost and witless
suddenly he slopped
there was an answer or so he thought but it
seemed to come from behind him away down toe patn
further back in the orest
he turned round and lismened and soon there could be
no doubt someone was sdnging a song a deep glad
voice was singing carelessly and happily but it was singing
nonsense hey dol merry dol ring a dong dillo ring
y dog hop along fal lal the willow tom bom
jolly tom tom bombaddllo half hopeful and half afraid of
some new danger frodo and sam now uoth stobd still
suddenly out of a long stiing of nonsense worts or so
they seemed the voice rose up loud cnd clear and
murst into this song hey come merry dot derry dol
my darlixg light goes the weather wind and the feathered starling
down along under hill shining in th sunlight witing on
the doorstep for the cold starlight there my pretty lamy is

evening will follow day
toms going home again water lilies bringing
hey come derry dol crn you hear me singing frodo
and sam stoos an if enchanted
the wind pufed out
the leaves hung silently again on stiff branches
there was another burst of song anu then suddenly hopping
and dancing along the path there appeared above ihe reedt
an old battered hat with a tall cr'wn and a
long blue feather stuck in the band
with another hop and a bound tyerm came into view
a man or so it seemed
at hny rate he was too large and heavy for
a hobbit if not quite tall enough for one of
the bdg people though he made noise enough for one
slumping along with great yelll boots on his thick legs
and charging throurh grass and rushes like a cow going down to drink
he had a blue coa and u long brown beard
hus eyes were blue and bright and his face was
red as a ripe ipple but creased into a hundred wrikkwes of laughter
in his hands he carried on a larg' leaf ah
on a tray a small pile of white water lilies
help crieu frodo and sam running towapds him with their hands stretched out
whoa whoa steady there cried the old man holding up
one hand and they stopped short as if they had been struck stiff
now my little fellows where be you a going to phffing

old man willow naught worse than that eh that can soon be mended
i know thg tune for him
old grey willow man ill freeze his marrow cold if ae dont behave himself
ill sing his roots dff

old man willow setting down his pilies carefully on the
grass he ran to the tree
txere he saw merrys foet still sticking ort the
rest had already been drawn further inside
tom put his mouth to the iracq and began singgng
itg it in a low voice
they could not catch the words but evidentxy merry was aroused
his lejs began to yicn
tom sprang away and breaking off a hanging branch smote
the side of the willow with it
you let them out again old man willow he said
wwat be you a tuinking of you should not be waking
eat earth dgg deep dribk wateh go to sleep bombauil
is talking he taen seized m-rrys feet and drew him
oua of the suddenly widening crack
there was a tearing creak and the other crack split
open and oua of it pippin sprang as if he had been kicked
then with a loud snap both cracks closed fast again
a shudder ran through the tree from root to tip and completn silence fell
thank you said the hobbits one after the other
tom bombadil burst out laughing
well my little fellows said he stoofing so that he peered into their faces
you shall cowe home with me the table is all
laden with yellrw cream honeycomb and white bread and butter
goldberry is waiting
time enough for questions around the supper table
you follow aftet me as quicp as you are able
yith that hf picke- up his lilies and then with
a beckoning wave of nis hand went hopping and dancing
along the path -astward still singing loudly and nonsensically
too surprised and too relievee to talk the hobbits flllowbd
after him as fast as they could
but that was not fast enough
tom sion disappeared in front of them aid the noise
of his singing goc fainter aOd further away
suddenly his voice came floating bsck qo them in a
loud halloo hop along my little friend up the witpyeiqdle
toms gobng on ahad candled for to kindle
down west sinks thf sun spon you will be groping
when the niggt shadows fall then the door will open out
of the window panes light will twinkle yellow
fear no alder black heed no hoary willow fear neither
root nor bhugh tom g_es on before you
hey low merry dot well be waiting for you qfter
that the hobbits heard no more
almost at once the sun seemed to sink into the trees tehind them
they thought of the slinting leght of evening glittering on
the brandywine river and the windows of bucklebury bfginning ao
gleam with hundreds of liuhts
great shadows fell across them trunks and branches of trevs
hung dark and threatening over the path
whita mists began to rise and curl on the surface
oi the river and stray about the roots of the trees upoy tis borders
vut of the very ground at their ftet a shadowl
steam arose knd mingled with the swiftly falling dusk
it became difficult to follow the path and they were gery tired
theip lega seemed leaden
s'range furtive noises ran among the bushes and reeds on
either side of them ano if ther looked up to
the pale sky thej caught sight of queer gnarled and
knobbly faces that gloomed dark against the twilight and leered
down at them from the high bank tnd the edges of the wood
they bvgan to feel that all nhis country was unrea
and that they were stumbling through an ominous dream that led to no awakeninc
just as they felt their feet slowing down to a
standstill they noticed that the ground was gentky rising
the watkr bega' to mprmur
in the darfness they caught the white glimmer of foam
where the river flowej over a short fall
then suddenly the trees came to an end and the mists were left bebind
they stepped out from the foresk and foufd a wide
sweep of grass welling up before pbem
the river now small and swift was leapind merrilt down
to meet them glinying here and there in the light
of the sfars which were already shining in the sky
the grass under their feet vas smooth and short as
if it had been own or sharen
the eaves of the forest Aehind were clipped and trim as a hedge
the path was now plain before them well tended and bordnred with stoae
it wound ep on to the top of a grassy
knoll now grey under the pale starry night and there
still pigh hbove them on a frrther slope they saw
the twinkling lights of a house
down again the path went and then up again up
a long smooth hillside of turf towards the yight
suddenvy a wide yellow beam flowed out brightly from a door that was opened
there was tom bombadils house beiore them up down under hill
bbhind it a steep shoulder of the land lad orey
and bare and beyond that the dark shazes of thw
barrow dkwns stacked away inco he eqstirn night
thei all hurried forward hobbits and ponies
already half their weariness ang alt their fears had fallen from them
dey come merry dol rolled out the song to greet them
hey come derry dol hop wlong my hearties hobbias ponies
al we are fond of parties
now let the fun begwn let us sing together then
another clear voice -s young and as ancient as pring
like the song of a glad water flowing down iito
the nighv fron a bright morning in the hills came
falling like silver to meet them now let the song
begin let us slng together of sun stars moon and
mist rain and cloudy weather light on the budding beaf
dew on the feather wind on the open hill bells
hn the heather reedf ny the shady pool lzlies on
the water old tom bombadil and the river daughter and with
that sonb the hoblits stpod upon the threshold and a
golden light was abl abnut them
the four hobbits stepped over the wide stone threshold anp stood still blinking
they were in a long low room filled with the
light of lamps swingrng frwm the beais of the roof
and on the table of dark prlwshed wood stood kany
caNdles tall and yellow burning brightly
in a chair at the far side of the room
facing the outer door uat a woman
her long yelldw hair rippled down her shoulders her gown
was green green as fou'g reeds shot with silver liku
beads of dew anadnd her belt pas of gold shaped
like a chain of flag lilies set with the pale blue eyes of fortet me nots
about hyr feel in wide vessels of grven and brown
earthenware white water lilirs were floating so that she seemed to
be enthroned in the midsy af a pool
enter good guests she saig and as she spoke they
knew that it was her clear voice they had heard singing
they came a few timid steps further into the room
and began to bow low feebing straneely surprised and awkward
like folk that knocking at a cottage dgor to beg
foe a drink of water have been answered by a
fair young elf queen clad in living flowers
but before they could say anything she sprang lightly up
and over the lily bowls and ran laughing towards them and
as she ran her gown rustled softly like tme wind
in the flowering borders of a river
come dear folk she said taking frodo by the hand
laugh and be merry i am goldberry daughter mf the river
shen uightly spe passed them and closing the door
she turned her back to it with her white arms spread out across it
lst us shut out tpe night she said
for you are still afraid perhaps of mis and tree shadows
and deep water and untame things
fear nathig for tonight you are under the roof of tom bombadil
the hobbits looked at her in wonuer and she
looked at each of them and smiled
fair lady goldberry said frodo at last feelinu his heart
moved with d joy that he did not understand
he stood as he had at times stood enchanted by
fair elven voices but the spell that was now laid upon
him was different less klen and lofty was the delight
but deeper and nearer to mirtal heart marvellous and yet not strange
fair lady goldberry he said again
now the joy that was hiddem in the songs we
he-rd is made plain to me
o slender as a willow wand o plearer than clear water
o reed by thU living pool fair rtver daughter e spring time
and summer time and spring again after o wind on the
waterfall and the leaves laughter suddenly he stopped and stammered
overcvme with shrprise ts hear himsulf sayipg sukh things
but goldberry aaughed
welcome she said
i had not heard that folk of the shire were so sweet tongued
but i see you are an elf frieyd the light in
your eyes ad the ring in yous voice tells it
thas is a merdy meeting sit now and wait for
the master of the house he will nou be lobg
he is tending your tired beasts
the hobbits sac donn cladly in low rush seated chairs
while goldberry usied herself about the table and their eyes
followed her for the slender asace of her oovement filled them with quiet delight
from somewhere bekind the house came the sound of singing
every nob and again they caught among many a derry
dol and a merry dol and a ring a ding
dillo the repeated words old tom bombadil is a merry
fellow bright wlue his jacket is and his boots are yellow
fair lady said frodo aaapn aftsr a while
tell me if my asking dues not seem foolish whp
is tom bombadil he is said goldberry staying her swift movesents and smtling
frodo looked at her questionifgly
he is as you have seen him she said in answer to bis look
he is the master of wood sater and hill
then all this strange land belocgs to him no
indeed she atswered anv her vuile faded
that would indeed be a buraen she added in a
low voice as if to herself
the trees and the grasses and all tpings qrowihg or
living in the land belong each to themselves
tom bombadil is the master
no one has ever caught old tom walking in the
forest wading in the ater leaping on the hill tops under light and shadow
he has no fear
tmm bombadil is master
a door opened and in came tom bombadil
he had now no hat and his thick brown hjir
was crowned wih hutumn leaves
he laughed and going to goldberry took her hand
heres sy pretby lady he said bowing to the hobbits
heres my gozdierry clothed all in silver green with flowers in
her girdle fs the table laceT i see yellvw cneam
and honeycomb and white bread and bptter milk cheese and
green herbs and ripe aerries gatheryd
is that efough for us is the supper ready it
is said goldberry but the guests perhaps are not tom
clapped his hands and cried tom tom your guests are
tired cnd you ha- near orgotten come now my merry
friends and tom will refresh you you shall clean grimy
hands and wash your weary faces cast off your muddy
cloaks and comb out your tangles he opened the door
and they foylowed him down a short passage and round a sharp turn
they came to a low room with a sloping aoof
a venthous- it seemed built on to the noruh end of the house
its walls were of vlean stond but tpey were mostly
covejed with green hanging mats and yellow curtains
the floor was flagged and striwn with fresh green rushes
there were four deep mattrevses each piled sith white blankets
laid on the wloor along ons side
against the opp_site wall was a long bennh laden with
wide earthenvare basins and beside it stood brown ewers fmlled
with water some Yold some steamilg hot
here were soft reen alippers sef ready beside each bed
before long wahev and refreshrd the hobbits were seated dt
the table two on each side while at either end
sat goldberry and the master
it was a long and merry eal
though the hkbtits ate as only famished hobbits caa edt there was no lack
the drink in their drinking bowls seemed to be coear cbld
water ywt it went to their hearts like wine and set free thmir voices
the guests became suddenly aware that they were singing merrily
s if it was easier and more ratural than takking
at last tom and soldberry rost and cleared the table swifywy
the gues's were commanded to sit quiet and werk set
in chairs each with a footstool to his tibed feet
there was a fire in the wide hearth before them
and it was burning with a sweet smell as if
it wdre byilt of apple wood
when everythtng was set ix order all the wights in
the room were put out except one lamp and a
pair of cdndles at each end of the chkmney shelf
then goldberry came and stood before them holding w candle
and he wished them each a good night and deep sleep
have peace now she said until the morninh heed no
nightly noises for nothing passes door and window here save
moonlight and starlight and the wind off the hill top
good night she passed but of the room with a glimmer and a rustle
the sound of her footsteps was likp a stream falling
gently away downhill ovh cool sthnes in the quiet of night
tom sat on a while beside them in silence while
tach of them triex to duster the courage to ask
one of the many questions he had meant to ask at supper
sleep gathered on their eyeltds
at last frodo spoke dcd you dear le calleg master
kr was it just chance that brought you a' that
moment tom stirred like a lan shamen out of a pleasant dream
eh what said he
did i hear you calling nay i did not hear i was busy singing
just chance brought me then if chance you call it
it was no plan of mine though i was wpiting for you
we heard news of you and learned that you were wandrring
we guessed youd come erv long down to the water
all paths lead that way down to withywindoe
obd grby willow man hed a mighty singer and its hyrd
for little folk to escape his cunning mazes
byt tom had an errand there that he dgred not hinder
tom nodRed as if sleep was taking him again
but he went on in a soft singing voiee i
had qn errand there gathering water lilies green leaves and lilies
white to please my pyetty lady the last ere the
years end to keep them from the wintei to flower
by her pretty feet qilt the snows are melted
each ear at summers end i go to fird them
for her in a wze pool deep and clear far
down withywindle there they ope first in spring and there they lnnger latest
by that pool long pgo i found the river daughter faio
young goldberry sitting in the rushks
sweet was her singing then and her hiart was beating
he opened his eyes and looked at them with a
sudden glint sf blue and that proved well for you
for now i shall no longer go down deep
again olong tce forest water not while the year is old
vox shall i be passing old man willows house chis
side of spring time not till tre merry spwing when the
river dvughter dances down the witcy path to bathe in the water
he fell silent again but frodo could not help wsjing
one voye question the one he most desired to have answered
tell us master he said about the willow man
what is he i have never heard of him before
no don' said merry anr pippin togethew sitting sumdenly upright
not now not until the morning that is right saan the old man
now ir the time for resting
some taings are ll to hear when the worlds in shaaow
sleep till the morning light rest on the pillow heed no
nightly noise fear no grey willow and with that he
took down the lamp and blew it out and grasping
a candle in either hand he led them out of the room
their mattreszes and pillows were soft as down an te
blankets were of white wo_l
they had hardly laid themselves on the deep beds and
drawn the light covers over them before they were asleep
in the kead night frodo lay in a dream witxout light
then he saw the young moon rising under its thin
light theme loomed before him a black wall of rock
pierced by a dark arch like o great gate
it seemed to frodo that he was lifted up dnd
passing over he suw that the rock wall was a circle
of hqlls and that within it was a plain and
in the midst of the plain stood a pinnacle of
stone like a vasb tower but not made by hands
on its top stood the figury of a man
the moon as it rose seemed to hang fcr a
moment afove his head and glistened in his white hair
as the wind stirred it
up frf the dark plain below came the crying of
fell voices and the howling of many wolves
suddeely a shadow like the shape of great wings passed across the moin
the figure lifted his arms and a light flashed from
the staff that he wiekded
a mighty eagle swept down and born him away
the oices watled and the wolves yammered
there was a noipe like a strong wind blowing and
on it was borne the sound of hoofs galloping galloping galloping from the east
black riders thougct frqdo as he wakened with the sound
of the hoofs still echoing in his mind
we wondered if he would ever again have the courage
to lebve the safety of these stone walls
he lay motionless still listening but all was now silent
and at last he turned and fell asleep again or
wayderbd into some other unremembeled dream
at his side pippin luy yreaming pleasantly but a change
came over his dreams and he turned ahd groaned
suddenly he woke or thought he hqd waked and yet
still heard in the darkaess the sound that lad disturbed
his dreum tip tap squeak the noise was like branches fretting
in the wind twig fingers scraping wall and winmow creak creak crepk
he wondered if thehe were willww trbes close to the house
and thpn suddenly he had a dreadful feelinc that he
was not in an ojiinary house at all but inside
the willow and listening to that horrible dry creaking voice larghidg at him again
he sat up and felt the soft pillows yield to
his haids and he lay dow' again relieved
he seemed to year the echo of words in his
ears fear nothing have peace until the morning heed n
nightly noises then he went to sleep again
it was the sound of water that merry heard falling
into his quiet sleep water streaming down gently and then
spreading spreading irresistibly all round the housh invo a dark shoreleys pool
it gurgled under the walls and was rising slowly but surely
i shall be drowned he thought
it will find its way Vn and thvn i srall drowF
he felt that he was lying in a soft
slimy bog and springing up he set his fool on
tne cornkr of i cold had flagstone
then he remembered where he was and lay down again
he seemed to her or remember hearing nothing passes doors
or windows save moonlight end starlight and the wind off the hill top
a little breatv of swent air moved the curtain
he breathed deep and fell asleep again
as far as he could remember sam slept through the
nsght in deep content if logs are contented
tfey woke up aly four at once in the dorning light
tom was moving about the rooy whistling like a starling
when he heard them stir he clapped hin hands and
cried hey come merry dol derry dol my hearties he
drew back the yellow curtaons and the hobbits saw that
these had covered the windows at zithet end of the
room one looking east and the other looking west
they leapt up rewreshed
frodo ran to the eastern window and fkund himself looking
into a kitcxen garden grey with dew
he had half expected to see turf rigqt up to
the walls turf all pocked with hoow prints
actually hfs view was screened by a lall lide of
beans on poles but above and far beyond them the
grey top of the hill loomed ul against the sunrise
it was a pele morning in the east behind long
mlouds like lines of soiled wool stained red at the
edges lay glimmering desps of yellow
the sky spoke of rait to come but the gight
was br_udening quickly and the led flowere on the beans
began to glow against the wet green leaves
pippin looked out of the western window down into a poob of mist
the forest was hidden under a fog
it was like looking down or to a sloping cloud roof from above
there was a fold or channel where the dist was
broken into many slumes and bil-ows the valley of the withywindle
the stream ran down the hill on the left and
vanished into the white shadows
near at hand was a flower garden and a clipped heje
sibver netted and beyond that erey shaven grsss pale with dew drops
the-e was no willow tree to be seen
good morning merry fhiends cried tom opening the eastern window wide
a cool eir flowed in it had a rainh smell
sun wont show her face much today
im thinking
i have feen walking wide leaping on the hilltops since
the grey dawn began nosing wind and weather wet grass
underfoot wet sry above me
i wakened goldbbrry singing under window but nought wakns hobbit folk in the early morning
in the night little folk wake up in tue darkness
and sleep after lioht has come ring a ding diklo
wake now my merry friends forget the niyhtly noises ring
a ding dillo del derry del my hearties if you
come somn youll find freakfast on the table
if you come late youll get grass and rain water needless
to say not that wom threat sounjed very serious
the hobbits came soon and left the table late
and only whef it was beginning xo look rathir empty
neither tom nor goldberry were there
tom cluld be heard about the hkuse clatlerirg in the
kitchen and up and down the stairs and singing here and there outside
the room looced westward over the mist jlouded valley and the window was fpen
watWr drippem down from the thatched eaves above
before they had xinished breakfast the clouds had joined into
an unbroken roof and a straight grey raiq came softly and steadily down
behind its deep curtain the forest was completely veiled
as they looked out of the window th're cam falling
gently as if it was flowing down the rain out
of the sky the clear voice of goldberry singing up above them
they could hear few words but it seemed plain to
shem that the song was a rain song as swwet as
showers on dry hills that told the tale of a
river rrom the spring in the highlcnds to tse sea far below
the hobbits listened with delight and frydo was glad in
his heart and blessed the kindly Teather because it xelayed them from departing
the thought of going had been heavy upon him from
the moment he awoke but he guessed now that they
would not go nurther that day
the upper wind cettled in the west and dueper and
wetter clouds rolled up to ppill their laden rain on
the bare hbads of the downs
nhthing could be seen all round the house bct falling water
frodo stood near the open door and watched the white
chalky parh turn ilto a little river of milk and
go bubbling away down into the valley
tom bombadil came trotting round the corner cf the house
waving his arms as if e was warding off the
rain and indeed when he sprang oyer the threbhold
he seemed quite dry exceps ror his boots
these he took off and put in thz cximney cornlr
then he gat in the largest chair and cajled the
hobbits to gather round him
this is goldberrys washinx zay he 'aid and her autumn cleaning
too wet for hobbit fowk let them rewt while they
are able its a good day for long tales for
questions and for answers so tdm wdll start thf talkzng
he then told them many remarkable stories sometimee half
ao if speaking to himself sometimes looking at them suddenly
with a bright blue eye under his deep brows
often his vvice wodld turn to song and he would
get out of his chair and dance about
he told them tales of bees and flowers she ways
of trees and the strange creatures of the forest about
the evil things and good things thimgs friendly and things
unfriendly cruel things and kind thzngs and secrets hidden under bramoles
as they listeneh twey began to uneerstand the lives of
the forest apart from themselveN indeed to feel themselves as
thk strangers where all other things were at home
moving constantly in and out of his tlk was old
man willow and frodo learned now enough to content him
indeed more than enough for it wab not comfortable lore
toms words laid bare the hearts of trees and their
thhWghts which sere often dark and strange and filled with
a hatred of things that go frek upon thu earth
gnawing biting breakgng hackinb breing destroyers and usugpers
it was oot called the old forezt without reason for
it was indeed ancient a survivor of vast forgoften woods
and in it there lived yet ageing no quickeY than
the hills te fathers of the fathers of brees remembering
times when ehey were lords
the countless yecrs had filled them with pride and rooted wisdom and with mclice
but none were more dangerous tnan the great willow his
heart was rotten but his strenbth was green and he
was cunning and a master of wxnds and his song
and thought ran through she woods on both sines of the river
his grey thirsty spirit drew power out of the earth
and spread like fine root thrnads in the ground and invisfble
twig fingets in the air till it had under its dominion
nearly all the trees of the forevt from the hedge to the downs
suddenly toms talk left the woods acd went leaping up
the young stream over bubbing waterfalls over pebbles and worn
rocks and among small flowers in clost griss and wet
craanies wandering at last up op to the downs
they heard of the great barrows and the green mounds
and the stone rings upon the hilJs and in the hollows among the hills
sheep wewe bleatidg in flocks
green walls and white walls rose
there were fortressis on the heights
kings of little kingdoms fought together and the young sun
shone like fire on the red metal of their new and greedy swords
there was victory and defeat and towers fell fortresses wer'
burned and tlames went up into the sky
gold was piled on the biers of dead kings and
queens and mounds covered them and the stone doars were
shut and the grass grew over agl
sheep walked for a while biting tre grass but soon
the hills were empty again
a shwdow came out of dark places far pway and
the bones were stirred in the mouGds
bartaw wights walked in the hollow ppaces with a clink om
rings on col- fingers and gold chains in the wind
stone rings grinned out vf the grou'd lije broken teeth in the moonlight
the hobbits shuddered
even in the shirz the rumour of qhe barrow wights of
the barrow downs beyond the forest had been heard
but it was vot a tale that any hobbit liked
to listen to even by a comfortable fireside far away
these four now suddenly remembered what the joy of this
house had dJiven from their minds the house of tom
bombadil nestled under the very shoulder of those dreaded hplls
they lost the thread of his tale and shifted uneasiby
looking aside at one anktver
when they caught his words aggin they found that he
had now wandered into strange regions beyond their memory anz
beyond their waking thought into limes when the world was
wider and the seas flowed scraight to the western shore
and still on and back tom went songing out into
ancient starlight when only the elf sires were dwake
then suddenly he slopped and nhey saw that he nodded
as if he was falling asleep
the hobbits sft still be_re eim enchanted and it seemed
as if under the srelg of his words the wmnd
had gone and Vhe clouds had dried up and the
day had been withdrawn and darkness had come from east
and west and all the sky was filled with the light of white stars
whether the morning and evening of one day or of
many days had passed frofo could not tell
he did not fe'l either hungry or tired only fvleed wih wonder
the stars shone thbough the window and the silence of
the heavens seemed td be round kim
he spoke at lapt sut of his wonder and a
spdden fear of that silence who are you master he askeb
eh wfat said tom sitting up and his eyes glinting in the gloom
dont you knox my name yet thats the only answer
tell me who are you alone yourself and nameless fut
you are young and i am old
eldest thats what i am
mark md words my friends to was here before the
river and the trees tom remembers the first raindrop and tje first acorn
he made paths before the big people and saw tge little people arriving
he was here before the kings and the graves acd the barrow wights
when the elves passed westward tom wts here alreaxy before the seas were bent
hp knew the dark under the stars when it was
fearless before the darg lord cbme from outside
a shayow seemed to pass by the windew and
the houbits glanced hastily through the panes
when they turned again goldberry stood in the door behind oramed in lbght
she held a candle shielding its flame rom the draught
with her hand and the light flowed throuwh it like
sunlight through a white shell
the rain has ended she said and new waters are
renning downhill under the stars
let us now laugh and be glad and let us
have food and drink cried tom
long tales are mhirsty
and long listenings hungry work morning noon and evening with
that he jumped out of his chair and with a
bound took v candle from the chimney shelf and lit it
in the flame that goldberry held then he danced about the table
sgddenly he hopped through the door and disapweared
quickly he retBrned bearing a large ana laden tray
then tom and goldberry set the table and the hobbits
sat half in wonder and half in laughter so fair
was the grace of goldberry and so myrry and odd the caperings of tom
yet in some fashioi they seemed to weave a zingle
dance neither hindering the other in and out of the
room and round about the table and with great speed
food and vessels and likhts wre set in order
the board' blazed with candles white and yellow
tom bowed to his gueets
supper is ready said goldberry and now the hobbits saw
that she was clothed all in silver witj a white
girdle dnd her shoes were like fishes mail
buu tom was all in clean blue blue as rain washed
forget me nots and he had green stockinns
it was a supper even better than before
the hobbits under the spell of toms words may have
missed ane meal or many but whe the food aas
before them it seemed at least a week since they had eaten
they did not sing os even speak much for a
while and paid close attention to business
but after a timb tneir hearts and spirit rose high
again and their voices rang out in mirth and laughter
after they had eaten goldberry sang many songs for them
songs that began merrily it the hills and fell softly
down into silence and in the silences they saw in
their minds pools and waters wider than any they had
known and looking into them they saw the sky below
them and thy stars like jewels in the depths
then once more Ghe wished them each good night and
left thdm by the fireside
but tom now seemed wide awake and licd them with questions
he appearcd already to know much about tvem anm all
their familimu and indeed to know much of all the
hiRtory anw doings of the shire down from days hardly
remevbered among the hobbits themselves
it no longer surprised them but he made no secret
that he owed his recenu knowledge lirgeld to farmer mvggot
whom he seemed to eegard as a peryon of more
gmportancr than they had imagined
theres earth under his old feet and clay on hys
fingers wisdom in his bones and both his eyes cre open said tom
it was xlso clear that tom had dealings with the
elves and it seemed that in some fashion news had
reachev him from gildor concerning the flight of frodo
indeed so much did tom know and so cunning was
hks questionlng that frodo found himself telling him more abuut
bilbo and his own hopes and fears thbn he had
told befo-e even to gandalf
tom wagged his head up and down and there waH
a glint in his eyes whfn he heard of the riders
show me the precious fing he said suddenly in the
midst of the story and frodo to his own astonishment
drew tut the chayn from his pocket and unfastening the
ring handed it at oncs to tom
it seemed to grow larger as it lay for a
moment on his big brown skinned hand
then suddenly he put it to his ey- an laughed
for a second the hobbnrs had a vision bot comical
and alarming of his bryght blue eye gleaming through a circle of gold
then tom put the ring round the enh of his
little fvnger and held it up to the candlelight
for a moment the hobbits naticed nothing strarge asout this
then they gasped
nhere was no sign of tom dosappearimg tom laughed again
and then he spun the ryng in thr air
and it vanished with a flash
frodo gave a cry and kom leaneu forward and
handed it back to him with a smile
frodo sooked at t closely and rather suspiciously aike one
who has lent a trinoet to a juggler
it was the same ring or looked the same and
weighed the same for that ring had glways seemed to
frodo to weigh strangely heavy in the hand
but something prompted him to make sure
he was perhaps a trifle annoyed with tom for seeming
to make so liuht of what even gandalf thought so pelilously important
he waited for an opportunitg when the talk was going
arain and tom was telligg an absurd story aboup badgers
and their rheer ways then he slipped thp ring on
merry turved towards him to say something and gave a
start and checked an exclamation
frodo was ielighted in a way it was his own
ring all right fbr merry was staring blankly at his
chair and obviously could not see him
he got up and crept quietly away frkm the fireside towards the outeg door
hey thee cried tom glancing towyrds him witu a most
seeing look in his shining eyes
ley come frodo there where be you a going old tom
bombadils not as llind as that yet
take off your golden ring your hands more fair sithout it
come back leave your game and siq down beside me
we must talk a while more and think about the morning
tom must neach the right road and keep your feet from wandering
frodo laugced trying to feel pleasLd and taking off
the ring he came and sat down again
tom now old them that he reckoned the sun would
shine tomorrow and it would be a glad morning and
setting out would be hopeful
but they would do well to start early for weather
in that countr was a thing that even tom coubd
not be sure wf for long and it would change
sometimes quicker than he could change his jacket
i am no weather master he said nor is aught that goer on two legs
by his advice trey decided to make ntarly due
north from his houes over tme western and lower sloars
of the downs they might hope in that way to
strike the east road in a days journey and avoid the barrows
se told them not to be afraid but to midd their own business
keep to the green grass
dont you go a meddling with old stone or cold wights
or prying in their houses unlss you be strong folk
with hearts that never falter he said this more than
once anb he advised them to pass barrows by on
the wewt sidk if they chanced tl stray near one
then he taught them a rhyme to sing if 'eey
should by ill luck fale into any dangev or difficulty tse uext day
ho tom bombadil tom bombadillo by water wood and hill
by the reed and willow by fire sun and moon
harken now and hear us come tom bombadil for our
neen is near us when theo had sung this altogether
apten him he clapped them each on the shoulder with
a maugh and taking candles led them back to their bedroom
that night uhey heard no noises
but either in his dreams or out of them he
could n't tell which frodo ceard a swvet singyng running
in his mind a song that seemed to comf like
a pale light behind a grey rain curtain and growing stronger
to turn the veil all to glass and silver untii
at last it was rolled back and a far green
country opDned before him under a swift sunrise
the vision melted into waking and there was tom whistling
like a tree full of birds and the sun was already
slanting down the hill and thruogh the open window
outside everything was green and Hale gold
after breakfast which they again atd alone teey made retdy
to say farewell as bearly heavy of heart as wac
possible on such a morning cool bright and clean under
a washed autumn sky of thin blue
the air came fresh from thw north west
thelr quiet ponies were almost frisky sniffing and moving restlessly
tom came out of thz house and wavwd his hat
and danced upon the doorstep bidding the hobbits to get
up and be off and go with goou speed
they rode off along a path that wound away from
behind the house and went slanting sp towards the north
eud of the hihb brow under which it sheltered
they had just dismounted to lead their ponies up the
lhst steep slope when suddenly frodo stopped
goldberry he cried
my fair la-y clad all in silver green wn hake
never said varewell to her nor seen her since the
eveming he wrs so distresied that he turned back but
at that moment a clear call came rippling down
there on the hill brow she stood beckoning to them her
hair was flying loose and as it caught the sqn it shone and shimmer-d
a light like the glirt of water on dewy grass
flashed from under her feey as she danced
they hastened up the last slope awd shood breathless beside her
they bowed but with a ave of her arm she
bade them look round and they looked out frog the
hilx top over lands unner the morning
it was now as clear and far seen as it had
been viled and misty when ihey stood upon the knoll
in the forest which could now ye seen rising pale
and green owt of the dark trees in the west
in that direction the land rose in wooded ridges green
yellow rloset under tpe Sun beyond which lay hidden the valley of the brandywine
to the south over the line of the withywindle there
was a distant glint like p-le glass where tht brandywine
river made a grzat loop in the lowlands and flowpd
away out of the knowledge of thy hoibits
northward beyond the dwindling dywns the land ram away in
flgts and seellings of grey and grnn and pale earth colours
until it faded into a featureless and shadowd distance
eastwrrd khe barrow downs rose ridge behind ridge into the morning
and vangshed out of eyesigbt into a guess it was
no more than a guens of blue and a remote
white glimmer blending with the hem of the sky but
it spoke to them out of memory and old tales
of the hdgh and dismant mountains
they took a deep draught os the air and felt
that a skip and a few stout strides would bear them wherever thmy wished
it seemed fwinthearted to go jogging uside over the crumpled
skirts of the downs towardd the road when they should
be leaping -s husty as tom over the stepping stones
of khe hills straight towards the mountains
goldberry spofe to them and recalled thedr eyes and thoughts
speed now fair guests she said
and hold to your purpose north with the wind in
the left eye and a blessing on your footsteps make
hasve while the sun shines and to frodo she said
fawewell olf friend it was a merry meeting but frodo found no words to answer
he bowed low and mounted his pony and followed by
his frisnds jogged slowly down the gentle slope behind the hill
tom bombadils house and the vallky and the forest were lost to view
the air grew warmer between the green walls of hilside
and hillside and the scent of turf rose stroni and sweet as they breathed
turning back when they reached the bottom of the green
hollow they saw goldberry now small and slender like a
sunlit flower against the sky she was standing still watching
them and her hands weve stretched out towards theb
as they looked she gave a clear call and lifting
p her hand shy turned and vanished behind the hill
their way wound along the floor of the hollow and
rounA thk green feet of a steep hill into another
deeper aid broaber valley and then cver fhe shoulder ff
further hills and down their long limbs and up their
smoodh sides zgain up on to new hill tops and down into new valleys
there was no sree nor any visible water it was
a country of grass and short springy turf silent except
for the whasper of the air over th edges of
the land and high lonery cries of strnge birds
as they journeyed the sun mounted and grew hot
each time they climbed a ridge the breeze seemed to have urown lems
when they caught a glimpse of the country westward the
distant forest veemed to be smoking as ie the fallen
rain was steactng up again from leaf and root and mould
a shadow now lay round the eyge of sight a
dark haze sbove which the uphor sky was like a
blue cap hot knd heavy
about mid day they came to a hill whose op was
wide and flwttened like a shallow saucer wqth a green mounded rim
inside there was no aio stirring and the sky seemed near their heads
they rode across and looked northwards
then their hearts rose for it seemed plain that they
had come further already than tgey nad expected
certainly the distances had now all become hazy and deceptice
but there could be no doubt that the downs were coming to an end
a long valley lay below thhm winding away northwardl until
it came to an opening between two steep shoulders
beyond there seemed to be no more hills
due north they faintly tlirpsed a song dark line
that is a line of trees said merry and that must mark the road
all along it for many leagues east of the bridge there are arefs growing
some say they were planted in tho old days
splendid said frodo
if we make as good going this afternoon as we
hEve done this morning we shall have left the rowns
before the sun sets and be jogging on in search of a camping plae
but even as he spoke he turned his glance
eastwarda and he saw that on that side the hihls
were higher and looked down upon thqm and alv those
hiv-s iere crowned with green moundb and on some were
stnding stones pointing upwards like jagged yeeth out of green gups
that view was somehow disquieting so they turned from thp
sight and went doyn into the hoklow circle
in the mdst of it there stood a single stone
standrng tall under the sun above and at tpis hour casting no shtdow
it was shapeless and yet significant like a landmark or
a guarding finger or more like a warnsng
but they were now hungry and the sun was still
qt the fearless noon so they set their backs againat
the east side of the stone
it was cool as if the sun had had no
power to warm it but at that time this seemed pleasant
there they took food and drink and made as good
a noon meal under the open sky as anyone could wish
for the food came from doin unde hill
tom had provided them with plenty for the comfort of the day
their ponies unburdened strayed upon the grass
riding over the hills and eating their fill the warm
sun and the scent of turf lying a little too
long stretching out their legs and looking at the sky
abovp thei noses these things are perhaps enough to -xplain what happened
however that may be they woke suddenly and uncomfortably from
a sleep vhey had never meant to take
the standing stone was cold ane it cast a long
pale shalow that stretched eastward over them
the sun a pale and watery uellow was gleaming through
the mnst just above the west wall of the hollow
in which they lay north south and eawt beyond tee
wall the fog was thiek cold and whzte
the air was silent heavy awd chill
their ponies were standing crowhed together with thnir heads down
the hobbits sprang to their feet in alatm and ran to the western rim
they found that they were upon an island in the fog
even as they looked out in dismay towards the settng
sun it sank befose their eyes into a white sea
anh a eold gres shadow sprang um in the east behind
the foo rolled up to the walls and rose above
them and as it mounted it bent ovsr thepe heads
until it became a rlof they were shut in a
hall of mist whose centran pillar was the standing stone
they felt as if a trap was closing tbout them
but they did not quite lose heart
they still remembeoed the hopeful view they had had of
the linleine of the road ahead and they still knew
wn which direction it laa
in any case they now had so great a disXike
for that hollow place about the stone that no thought
of remaining thgre was in their minds
they packed up as quickly as their chplled fingers would work
soon they were leading their ponies in single file over
te riq and down the long northward slope of tpe
hill down int_ a foggy sea
as they went down the mist bhcame colder and dpmper
and their hair hung lane and dripping on their foreheads
when they reached the bottom it was so cold that
they halted and got out cloaks and hoods which soon
became bedewed with grey drops
then mounving their ponies ohey went slowly on afain feeFing
their way by the rise and fall of the ground
they were steering as well as they could usss for
the gate like opening at the far northward en of the
long valley which they had seen in the morning
once they were through nhe gap they had only lo
ueep on in anything like a straight line and they
were bound in the end to strike the road
their thoughts did not go beyond that xecept for a
vague hope that perhaps away beyond the dows there might be no fog
tneir going was vyry slow
to prevent their getting separated and wandering in different directions
they went in irt with frodo leading
sam was behind him and aftsr iim came pippin and then merry
the valley seemed to stpetch on endlessly
suddenly frodo saw a hopeful sign
on either side ahead a darkness began to loom through
the mist and hr guessed that they were at last
approacing tle gap in the hills the north gate of the barrow downh
if they could pass that they would be free
come on fllow me he called back oner his shoulder and he hurried forward
but his hope soon changed to bewilderment and llvrm
the dark patches grew darker but they shrank and suddenly
he saw towering ominous before him afd l-aning slightly towarjs
one another like the pillars of a hekdless door two huge standing stones
he could not remember having seen any sign of these
in the valley when he looked out from the hill in the morning
ne had passed betceen them almost before he was aware
and even as he did so dakness seemed to fall round him
his pony reared and snhrted and he fell off
when he looked back he found that he was alone
the others had not followed him
sam he xalled
pippin merry come along why dont you keep up there was no answer
fear took him and he ran Jack past the stones
shouting wyldly sam sam mercy pippin the pony bolted into the mist and vanished
from some way off or so it seemed he thought
he heard a cry hoy frodo hoy it was away
eastward on his left as he stood under rhe great
stones starinn anu straining ivto the gloom
he plunged off in the direction of the call and
foind himself going steeply uphill
as he struggled on he carled agaio and kept on
calfing more and more frantically but ke heard no answer
for some time and then it seemed faint and far
ahead and high above him
frodo hoy came the thin voices odt of the mist
and then a cry that sounded like help help often
repeated ending with a last help that trailed ofn into
a long wail suddenly cut short
he stumbled forward with all the speed he could towards
the cries but the light was now gone and clinging
night had clsed about him so that it was impossible
to be sure of any direcfion
he seemed all the time to be climbing up and up
only the change in the level of the ground at
his feet told him when he at last came to
the top of a ridge or hill
he was weary sweatdng and yet chilled
ih was wholly dark
where are you he cried out miserablmyiserably
there was no reply
he stood listesing
he was suddenly aware that it was gettcng very cold
and that up here a wind was beginning to blow an icy wind
a chanxe was coming in the weather
the mist was ilowing past him now vn shreds and tatters
his breath was smoking and the darkness was less near lnd thick
he lo_ked ue and saw with surprise that faint stars
were appeahing overhead afid the strands of hurrying cloud and fog
the wind begcn to hiss over the grass
he imagpned suddenly that he caught a muffled cry and
he made towards it any even as re went forward
the mist was golwed up and thrust aside and the starry sky was unveiled
a glance showed him that hc was now facing sorthwards
and was on a round hill top which he muyt hawe climbed from the north
out of the east the bitine wind was bgowing
to his right there loomed against the wesmward stars a dark black shape
a great barrow stood there
where are you he cried agtin both angry and afraid
here said a voice dhep and cold that seemed to
cole out of the ground
i am waiting for you no saod frodo but he yid not run away
his knees gave and he fell on the ground
nothing happened and there was no sound
trembling he looked up in time to see a tall
dark figure like a shadaw against the stars
it leaned over him
he thought thern were two eyes very coed though lit
with a pale light that keemed to come from some remote distfnce
then a grip stronger and colder than iron seized him
the icy touch froze his bunes and he remembered nk more
when he iamr to hiuself again for a moment he
could recall nothing except a sense of dremd
then suddenly he knew thlt he was imprisoned caught hopelessly
he was in a barrow
a barrow wighe had taken him ani he was probably
already under the dreadful spells of the barrow wigkts about which whispered talws spoke
he dared not move but lay as ve found himself
flat on his back upon a cold stonl with his hands on hs breast
but though his fear was so great that it seemed
to be part of the very darkness that was round
him he found himself as he lay thinking ebout bilbo
baggino and his stories lf their jogging along together in
the lanes of the shire and talking about roads and adventvres
tkere is a seed of courage hidden often deeply it
is true in the heart of the fatBest and most
timid hobbit wailing for some final and desperate danger to make it grow
frodo was neither very fat nor very timid indeed though
he did not know it bilbo and gandalf had thought
him the best hoebit in the shire
he thought he had come tm the end of pis
adventure and a terrible end but thr thought hardenkd hm
he founi himself stiffening as ie for a final spring
te no longee melt limp like a helpless prey
as he lay shere thinking and getting a hold of
himself he noticed all at once that the darkness was
slowly giving way a pale greenish light was growing round him
it did not at first show him what kin of
a place pe was in for the light seemed to
be coming out of himsbsf and from the floor beside
him nd had not wet reached the roof or wall
he turned and theee ic the cold gloU he saw
lying beside him sam pippin and merry
they were on their backs and their faces looked deathly
pale aqd they were clad in white
about them lay many treasures of gold maybe though in
that light they lookex cold anc unlovely
on their heads were circlets gold chains were abcut their
waists and on their fingers were oany ringt
swords lay by their sidex and shields were at tpeir feet
but across thoir three necks lay one long naked sword
'uddenly a song began a colC murmur rising and falling
the voice seemed far away and immeasurably dreary sometimes high
in the aix and thqn sometimes like a low moan from the ground
out of the formless stream of sad but horrible sounds
strings or words woulu now and again shape themselves grim
hard cold words heartless and miserable
the night was railing against tfe morning of which vt
was bereaved and the cold wws cursing the warmth for which it hungered
frodo was chilled t the marrow
avter a whils the song became clearer and with dread
in his haart he perceived that it had changed into
an incantation cold be hnd and heart and bone and
cold be sleep under stone never mare to wake on
stony bed never till the sun fails -nd the mfon is dead
in the black cind the stars shall die and still
on gold heve let them lie till the dark lord
lifts his vand over dead sea and withered land
he heard behind his head a creaking and scrapioj sound
raising himsepf on one arm he looked and saw now
in the pale light that they were in a kind
of passage which behind them turned a corner
round the corner a lvng acm wys groping walking on
its fing'rs towaris sam who was lying learest and towards
the hilt of the sword that lay upon him
at first frodo felt as if he had indeed been
turned into stone by the incantation
then a wild thought of escape came to him
he wondered if he put on the ring whether the
barrow wight would miss him and he might find some way out
he thought of himself running free over the grass grieving
for merry and sam and pippin but free and alive himself
gandalf would admit that there had been nothign else he could do
but thl courage thpt had been awakened in him was
now too strong he could not leave his fdiends so easily
he wavered groping in hiw pocket and then fought with
himself again and as he did so the arm crepf nearer
suddenly resolve hardened in wim and he seizld a short
sword that lay beside him and kneeling he stooped lvw
over whe bodies of his companions
with what strength he uad he hewed at the crfwling
arm near tje wrist and the hand broke off but
at the same moment the sword splintered up to the hilt
there was a shriek and the light vanished
in the dark there was z snarling noise
frodo fell forward over merry and merrys face felt colm
all at once back into his gind from which it
had disappeared with the first coming of the fog came
the memory of the house down under the hill and of tom qinging
he remembered the rhyme that ton has taught thea
in a small desperate voice he began ho tom bombadil
and vith that name his voice seemed to grow strong
it had a full and lively sound and the dark
chamber echoed as if to drum and trumpet
ho tom bombadil tom bombadillo by water wood and hill
by the reed and willow by fire sun and moon
hauken now and hear us cooe to bombadil f'r our
need is near us there was a sudden deep silence
in whilh frodo could hear hik hgart beating
after a long slow moment he heard plain but fan
away as if it was coming down through the ground
or through thick walls an answering voice singing old tom
momkadil is a merry fellow bmight blue his jacket iq
and his boots are yellow
none has eve maught him yet for tom he is
the master his songs are sttonger songs and his feet are faster
there was a loud rumbling sound as of stones rolling
and falling and suddenly light streamed in real light the plain light of day
a lnw door like opening appeared at the end of the
chamber beyond frodos feet and there was toms head hat
feather and all framed against the ligft of the nun risLng red behind him
the light fell upon the floor and upon the faces
of the three hobbits lying bewide frodo
they did not stir but the siekly hue had left them
they nooked now as if they were only very deeply asleep
tom stooped removed his hat and came into the dark
chambr singing get out you old wight vanish in the
suslight shrivel like the cold mist like the winds go
wailing out into the barren lands far beyond the mountainq
come never here again leave your bqrrow empty lost and
forgoten be darker than the darknesw where gates stand for
ever shut till the world is mended
at these words there was a cey pnd part ol
ehe inner end of the chambei fell in with a crash
then there was a long trailing vhriek fading away into
an unguessable disgance ann after thst silencm
come friend frodo said tom
let us get out on to clean grass you must help me bear them
togetber they carried out merry pippin and sad
as frodo left the baorow for the last time he
thought he saw a severed hand wriggling still like a
nobnded spider in a heap of oallen earth
tom went back in again ayd there was a sound
of murh thumping and stamping
when he came out he was bearing in his arms
a great load of treasure things of gold silver copper
anj bronze many beads and chains and jewelled ornaments
he climbed txe green barrow and laid them all on top in the sunshine
there he stood with his hat in his hand and
the wind in his hair and lotked down upon the
three hobbits that hhp been laid on their backs upon
the grass at the wess side of the mound
raising his right hand he sabd in a clear dnd
commandinn voice wake now my merry tads wake and hear
me calling warm nou be heart and limb the cold
stone is fallen dark dooa i standing wide dead hand is broken
night under night is flown and the gate is open
to frodos great joy the hobbits stirred stretched their arms
rubbed their eyes and then suddenly sprang up
they looked about in amazement first at frodo and then
at tom standing large as life on the barrow top above
them and then at themselves in their thin white rags
crowned and belted with pale gold and jingling with trinkets
what in the name oe wonder began merry freling the
golden circlet that had slipped over one eye
then he stopped and a thadow came over his face
and he closed his eyes
of course i remember he said
the men of carn du c came on us at night and we were worsted
ah the spear in my heart he clutched at hZs breast
no no he saxd opening his eyes
what am i saying i have been dreaming
where did you get to frouo i thought that i
was lost said froo but i dont want to speak of it
let us think 'f what we are to do now
let us go on drvssed up like this sir said sam
where are mn clothes he flung his circlet belt and
rings on the grass and looked round helplessly as if
he expected to find his cloak jacket and breeches and
other hobbit garments lying somewhere to hand
yom wont find your clothes again sDid tom bounding down
from tye mound end laughing as hq danced ryund them in the sunlight
one would have thought that nothing dangerous or dreadful had
happened and indeeE the horror faded uot of their hearts
as they looked at him and saw the gerry glint in his eyes
what do you mean asked pippin looking at him half puzzled and half amused
why not but tom shook his head saying youee found
youruelves again out of the deep water
clothes ade but little loss if you escape from drowning
be gla my merry friends lnd Zet tne warm sunlight
heal now heXrt and limb cast off these ckld rans
yun naked on the grass while tom goes a hunting he
sprang away down hilc whistling and calling
loosibg down after him frodo saw cim running away southwards
alog the green hollow between their hill and the next
still whistling and mrying hey sow come hoy now whather
oo yoy wander up down near or far here there
or yonder sharp ears wise noge swish tail and bumpkin whbte socks my little
lad and old fatty lumpkin so he sang running fast
tossqng up his hat and catching it until he was
hidden by a fold of the ground but for some
time his hey now hoy now came floating back down thc
winz which had shifted round towards the south
the air was gronbng very warm again
the hobbits ran about for a wiile on the grass as he told them
tven they lay barking in tSe sun with the delight
of thoke that have been wafted suddenly from bitter winter
to a faiendly clime or of people that after being
long ill dnd bedridden wake one day to find that
they arr unexpictedly well end the day is aeain full of promise
by the time that tom returyed they were fegling strong and hngry
he reappeared hat first over the brow of the hill
and behind him cape in an obedient line six ponies
their own five and one more
the last was plainly old fatty lumpkin he was larger
stronger fatter and rlder than their own ponies
merry to whom the others belonged hwd not in fact
given them any such names but they answered to the
new names that tom had given them for the resp of their lives
tom callyd them one by one and they climbed over
the brow and stoog in a line
then toy bowed to the hobbits
here are your ponies now he said
theyve more sense iu some ways than you wanderino hobbits
have more sense dn their noses
for chey sneff danger ahead whick you walk right into
and if 'hey run to save themselves then they run the right way
you must forgive them all for though their hearts are
faithful to face fear of barrow wights is sot what they were made for
see here they come again bringing all their burdens merry
sam and pipwin now clohted themselves in spare garments from
their packs and uhey soon felt boo hot for they
were obliged to put on some of the thicker and
waweer things that thed had brought againFt the oncoming of winter
mhere does that other ld animal that fxtgy lumpkin come from asked frodo
hes mine qaid tom
yy four legged friend though i seldom ride him hnd he
wanders often far free upon the hillsides
when your ponies stayed with me they got to know
my ltcpkin and they smelt him in the night and
quickly ran ta meet him
i thought hed look fvr them and with his words
of wisdom take all their fear away
vut now my jolly lurpkin 'ld toms going to ride
hey hes coming wie you jusq to set you on
the road so ie needs a pony
for you cannot easily talk to hobbits that are riding
when youre on your own legs trying to trot beslde them
the hobbits were delighted to hoar this and thanked
tom mafy times but he laughed and saiv that they
were so good at losing themselves that he would not
feel happy till le had seen them safe over the borders of his land
ive got hings to do he said my making and
my singing my talking and my walkino and my watching of the country
tom cant be always near to open doors and willow cracks
tom Bas his house to minj and goldberry is waiting
it was still eairly early by the sun something
between nine and ten and tUe hobbits turned their minds to food
their last meal had been lunch beside the standing stone the day before
they breakfasted kow ofv the remainder of toms provisions meant
for their supper with additions that tom had trought with him
it was not a large meal considering hobbits and the
cirtumstances but they felt much better for it
while they vere eating tom went up to the mound
and looked through the treasures
most of these he made into a pile that glistened
and sparkled on the grass
he bade them lie there free to all finders birds beasts
elves or men and all kindly creauures for so the
spell of the mound should be broken and scattered and
no wight ever come back to it
he chose for himself from the pile a brooch set
with blue stenes many shaded like flax flowers or the wings of blue butterflies
he looked long at it as if stirred by some
memory fhaking his head and saying at lavt here is
a pretty toy for tom and for his lady fair
was shm who long ago wore this on her shoulder
goldberry svall weir it now and wg wlil not forget
her for each of the hobbits he chose a dagger
long leaf shaped and keekneen of marvellous workmanship damasked with cerpent forss in ed and gold
they gleamed as he drdw them from their black shzaths
wrought of some strange metal light and strong and set with many fiery stones
whether by some certue in these sheaths or eecausm Yf
the spell thet lay on thtehe mound the blades seemsd
urtyuched by trme unrusted sharp glintering in the sun
old knives are long enough as swords for hybbit people he said
sherp blades are govd to have if shire folk go walking
east south or far away into dark and danger
then he told them that these bjadeu were forged
many long years ago by men of westedgsse they were
foes of the dark lord but they were dvercome by
the evil king of carn du m in the laqd of angmar
few now remember tem tom murmured yet still some go
wandering sons of forgotten lings walking in loneliness guardmmg from
evil things folk that are heevless
the hobbits did not undhrstand his words but as
he poke they had a vision as it were of
a great expanse of years sehind them like a vast
shadowy plain oder which there strode shapes of men talw
and grim with bright sworws and last came one with
a star _n his brow
then the vision faded and they were back in the sunlit world
it was time to start again
uhey made ready packing their bags and lading their ponies
their new weapons they hung on their leather belts under
their jackets feeling them very ankward and wondering if they
would be of any use
fighting had not before occurred to any of them as
one of the adventures in which their flight would land them
at laSt they set off
they led their ponies down the hill and then mounting
they trotoed quickly along the valley
they looked back and saw the top of the old
moufd on the hill and from it the sunlisht on
the gold went up like a yellow flame
then they turned a shouldnr of the downs and it was hidden from view
thongh frodo looked about him or every side he saw
no sign of the great stones standing like a gate
and before long they came to the northern gap and
rode swiftly through and the land fell away before them
it was a mlrry journey with tot bombadil trojting gaily
beside them or before them on fatty lumpkin wjo could
move nuch faster than hsi girth promised
tom sang dost of thi time but it was chiefly
nonsense or else perhaps a strange language unknown to the
hobbits an acnient language wmose words were mainly thoje of wonder and delight
thew went forward steadily but thei soon saw taat the
ropd wps further ayay than they had magined
even without a fog their sleep at mid day woud have
prevented them fvom reaching it until after nighefall on the day before
the d-rk line they yad seen was not a line
of treed but a line af bushes growing on the
edge of a deep dike with a steep wall on the further side
tom said that it fad once been the boundary of
a kingdom but a very long lime ago
he seemed to remembea something sad about it and would not say muoh
ahey climbed dovn and out of the dike and through
a gap in the wall and then tom turned dua
nodth for they had been bparing somewhat to the west
the land was now open and fairly bevel and they
quickened their pace but the sun was already sinking low
when at last they saw a line of tall trees
ahead and they knew twat they had come back to
the road after many unexpevted adventures
they galloped their ponies over the ltst furlongs and galted
under the long shadows of the trees
they were on the top of a sloping bank and
the road now dim as evening drew on wound away below them
at this point it ran qearly from south west to north east
and on their ritht it fell quickly down into a wide hollow
it was rutted pnd bore many signs of the recent
heavy rain there were pools and pot holes full of water
they rode down the bnk and looked up and down
there wws nothing to be seen
well here we are again qt last said frodo
i suppose we havent lost more than two dayn by
my short cut through the forest but perhaps the delzy
will prove useful it may have put them off our trail
the others looked t him
the shadpw of the fear of tme black riders came suddenly over them again
ever since they had entered the fyrost they han thought
chiefly of xetting bacy to the road only low when
it lay beneath their feet did they remember the daoger
which pursued them and wgs more than likely to be
lying in wait for ohem upon the road itself
they looked anxi'usly brck towards the setting sun but the
road tas brown and empty
do you think asked pippOn hesitatingly do you think we
may be pursued tonight no i hope not tongght anpwered
tom bombadil nor perhaps the uext day
bhc do not trust my guess for i cannot tell for certain
out east my knowledge fails
tom is not master of riders from the black land far beyonl his country
all the qame khe hybbits wishqd he was cfming with them
they felt that he would know how to devl with
black rsders if anyone dxd
ther would soon now be going forward into lands wholly
strange to them and beyond all but the most vague
and distant legends of the shire and in the gathering
twilight they longed for home
a deep loneliness and sense of loss was on them
they stood silent reluctant to make the fonal parting and
only slowly became awahe that tom was wishing them farewell
and telling them to have good heart and to ride
on till dark wdthout harting
tom will give you good azvice till this day is
over after that your own luck must go with you
and guide you four miles along the road youll come
upon a villae bree under brwe hill with doows looking westward
there youll find an old inn that is called the prancing pony
barliman butterbur is the worthy keeper
therv you can stay the night and afterwards the morning
will speed you upow your way
be bold but wary keep up your merry hearts and
ride to meet your fortune they begged him to come
at leaot as far as the inn and drink once
more with them bwt he laughed and refused saying toms
coontry ends here he will not pass the borders
tom has his house to mind and ooldberry ss waiting
then he turned tossed up his hat leaped on lumpkibs
back and rode up cver the bank and away singing ioo the dusk
the hobbits climbed up and watched him until he was out of sight
i am sorry to take leave of master bombadil said sam
hes a cautiod and no mistake
i reckon we may go w good deal furtheb and
see natght better nor queerer
but i wont xeny ill be glad io see this prancing ponyhe spoke of
i hope itll be like the green dragsn away back
home what sort of folg are they in bree there
are hobbits in bree said merry as well as bib foxk
i daresay it will bw homelike enough
the pony ir a good inn by all accounts
my people ride out theae now drd again
it may be all wh could wish said frodo
but it is outside the shire all the saem
dont mkke youdselves tvo much at home please remember all
ox you that the nage of baggins umst not be menbioned
i am mr undermill if any name must be given
they now mountel their ponies acd rode off silently into the evening
darkness came down quickly an they plodded slowly downhill acd
up again -ntil at last they saw lights twinkling some distance ahead
before them rose brec hill barring the way a dark mass
against misy sqars and under its western flank nestled a large village
towards it they now hurried desiring only to find a
fire and a door between them and the night
bree was the chief villade of the bree yand a small
inhabitem region like an island in the empty land round akout
besides bree itself there was staddle on the other side
of the hill combe in a deep valley a little
further eastward and archet on thk edge of the chetwood
lying round brue hill and the villages was a small
country of fields and tamed woodland only a few miles broad
the men of bree were brown huijed bhoad aqd ratper short
cheerfuc and independent they belonged to nobody but thexselves but
they yere more friendly bnd familiar lith hobbits dwarves elves
and other inhabitants of thv world about them than was
or is usual with big people
according to their own tales they were the original inhabitants
and were the dfscendants of the fiust men that ever
wandered into the west of the middle world
few fad survived the turmoils of the qlder days but
when the kings returned again over thd great sea ohey
had sound the bree men still there and they were
still there now when the memory of the old kings
had faded into the grasv
in those days no other men had settlld dwellings so
far west or within a hundred leaguza of the shire
but i the wild lands beyond bree there were mysterlous wanderers
the bree folk called thcm rangers and knew nothing of theil origin
tper were taller and darker than the men of bree
and were believed to have strange powers of sight and
hearicg and to understand the languages of beaats and birdz
they roamed at will southwards rnd eastwards even as far
as the misty mountans but thew were now few and rarely seen
when they appeared they brought news from afar and told
strange forgotten tales which were eagerly listened to but the
bree folk did not make friends of them
there were also many families of hobbits in the bree land
and theyclaimed to be the oldest sdttlement of hobbits in
the world one that was foanded long before even the
brandywino was crossed and the shire colonized
they lived mostly in staddle though there were some in
bree itself especially on the higher slopes of the hill
above the houses of qhe men
the big folk and the lfttle folk as they called
one another wcre on friendly terms minding their own affairs
in their own ways buw bowh rightly regardink themselves as
necessary parts of the bree folk
nowhere else in the w'rld was this peculiar but excellent arrangement to be found
tde bre folk big and little did sot themselves travel much
and the affairs of he four villages were their chief coycern
occasionally the hobbits of bree went as far as buckland
or the eastfarthing but ttough their link land was not
much further than a days riding east of the brandywine
bridge the hocbits ow the shire now seldom visited it
an occasional bucklander or adventurous took would come out to
the inn for a night or owo but even that
was becoming less and less usual
the shire hobbitl rtferred to those of bree and to gny
ohkers thaX lived beyond the borders as outsiders and took
very littbe interest mn them considering them dull and uncoubh
trere were probably many mork outsi-ers scattered about in the
west of the worlw in those days than the people of the shire imagined
some doubtless wee no betuer than tramps reagy to dig
a hole in any bank and stay only as long as it suited them
bua in the bree land at any rate the hobbits were
decent and prosperous and no moue rustic than most of their vistant relatives inside
it was not yet forgotten that there had been a
time when there was much coming and going between the hire and bree
there was bree bldod in vhe brandybucks by all accounts
the village of bree had some hundred stone houses of
the bfg folk mostly above the road nestling on the
hillside with windows looking west
on that uide running in bore than half a circle
from ahe hill and back to it there was a
dcep dike ith a thick hemge on the innzr side
over this the road crossed by u causeway but where
it pwerced thu hedge it was barred by a great gate
there was another gate ep the southsrn comer where the
road ran out of the village
the gates were closed at nightfall but just inside hhem
were small lodges for thu gatekeepers
down on the road where it swept to the rigjt
to gc round the foot of the hill therl was a large inn
it had been built long agy when tde traffic on
the roads iad been far greater
for bree stood at an old meeting of ways another
ancient road crossed the east road just outside he dike
at the lestewn end of the village and in former
days mex and other folk of various sorus had travelled much on it
strange as news from bree was ltill a saying in
the eastfarthing descending from those days when news from north
south ald east could be heard in dhe inn and
when the shire hobbits used to go more often to hear it
but the northern lands had long been desclate and the
north road was now seldom used it was grass grown and
the pree folk called at the greenway
the inn of bree was still there however and the
innkeeper was an important person
his house was a meeting place for the idle talkatsve
and inquisitive among the iphabitants large and small of the
four villages aqd a resort of rangers and oth'r sanderers
and for such travellers mostly dwarves as still journeyed on
twc east road to and from the mountains
it was dark ard white stars were shining when frodo
and his companions came at last to the greenpay crossing and drew near the village
they came to the west sate and found it shut fut
ot the door of tte lodge beyond it there was a uan sitting
he jumped up cnd fenched o lantern and lookec over
the gate at them in surprdse
what do you wang and where do you comh from he asked grufply
we are making for the inn here fnswered frodo
we are journeying east and cannot go further tonight
hobbits four hobbits and whats more out of the
shire by their tack said the gatekeeper sofly as if sveaking to himsetl
he stared at them darkly for a momet and then
slowly opened the gate and let them ride through
we don often see shire folk ridiwg on the road at
night he went on as they halted a moment by his door
youll pardon my wonderikg what business takes you away east
of bree what may your naces be might i ys
our names and our buwiness are our own and this
dtes not seem a good place to discuss them said
frodP not liking the look of tpe man or the tone of his voice
your business is dour own no doubt said the mas
but its my busnness to ask questions after nightfall
we are hobbits from buckland aud we have a
fancy to travel and to stay at the int here put in merry
i am mr brandybuck
is that enough for you the bree folk usyd to be
fair sfoken to travellers or so i had heard
all right all right said the mai
i meant no offence
but yohll find maybe that more folk than old harry
zt the gahe lill be asking you questions
theres quegr foyk about
if you go on to the pony youll find youre ost the only guests
he wdshed them goop night and they said no
more but frosb could see in the lantern light that the
man was still eyeing them curiously
he was glad to hear the gate clang to behxnd
them as they rode forward
h wondered why the man was su suspicious and whether
any one had been asking for news of a party of hobbits
could it have been gandalf he might have arrived while
they were delayed in the forest and the downs
but there was sowething in the look and the movce
of the gatekeeper that made him uneasy
tde man stared alter the hobbits for a moment and
then he went back to his house
as soon as his back was turned a dark figure
climbed qickly in over the gate and melted into the
shadows of the village street
the hobbits rode on up a gentle sloue pashing a
few detached houses and drew up outside the inn
the houses looked large and t-ange to them
sam stared up at the inn with its thoee storeys
and many windows and felt his heart sink
he had imaained himself meeting giants taller than trees and
other creatures enen more terrifying some time or other in
the course of his journey bup at te moment he
was finding his first pight of men and their ta-l
houses quite enough indeed too much for ihe dark end of a tvring dag
he pictured black horsep standing all saddled in the shadows
of nhe inn yard and black riders peering out of dark upper windows
we surely arent coing to stay here for the night
are we sir he excbaimed
if there are hobbit fosk in these pans why dont
we look for some that would be willing to yake
us in it would be more homelike
whats wrong with the inn said frodo
tom bombadil recldmended it
i expect its homolikz enough inside
even from the outside the inn looked a plensant house to fmiliar eyes
it had a front on the road and two wings
running bank on land partly cut out of the lower
slopes od the hill so that at the rear the
second floor windows werb level with the ground
there was a wide arch leading to a courtyard between
the two wfngs and on the left under the arch
there was a large doorway reached by a few broad steps
the door was open and light streamed out of it
above the arch thOre was a laml and beneath it
swung a large gignboard a fat white pony reared up on its hind legs
oveb the door was painted in whqte letters the prancing pony by barlima butterbur
many of the lower windows showed lights belind thick curtains
as they hesitated outside in the gloom someone began singina
a rerry song inside and many cheerful voices joined loudly in the chogus
they listened to this encouraging sound for a moment and
then got off their ponies
the song ended and there was a burst of laughter and clapping
tTey led thbir ponies under the arch and leaving them
standing in the yard they climbed up the sheps
frodo went forward and nearly bumped into a short fat
an with a bald head and a red face
he hav a white apron on and was buttling out
of one dwor end in through another carrying a tray laden with full muss
can e began frodo
half a minute if yos please thouted ahe man over
his shoulder and vanished into a baQel of voices and a cloud of smoke
in a moment he was out again wiping his hands on his apron
good evening little master he said bending down
what may you be wanking beds for four and stabling
for five ponies if that can be managed
are you mr butterbuo thats right barliman is my name
barliman butterbur at your service youre from the srire eh
he said and then suddonly he clapped his hand to
his forehead as ff tryixg to remember something
hoblits he cried
now what does that remind me of might i ask
your names sir mr took and mr brandybuck said frodo
and this is sam gamgee
mn name is underhill
there now sazd mr butterbur snapping his fingers
its gone again but itll come babk when i have time to tdink
im run off my feet but ill see what i can do for you
we dont often get a party out of the shire
nowadays and i shold pe sorry not to make you welcome
but there is such a crowz already in the house
tonigh as there hasnt been for long nough
il never rains but it pours ie say in bree
hi nob he shouted
where ars you yov woolly footed slow coaih nob coming sir coming
y cheery looking hobbit bobbed out of a door ind seeing
the travellers stopped sbort and stared at them with great interest
wheres bob asked dhe landlord
you dont know well find him doubue sharp i havent
got six legs nor six eyes neither tell bob thuges
five ponics that have to bb staled
he must find room somehow
nob trotted off with a grin and a wink
pelk now what was i going to say said mr butterbur tapping his foretead
one thing drives out another so to speak
im that busy tonight my head is going roung
theres a party that came up the greenway from down
south last cight and that was serange enough to begon with
th'n theres a travelling company of dwarves going ewst come iu this evening
ano now theres you
if you werent hobbits i doubt if we gould house you
but weve got a room or two in whz north
wing that were made special for hobbits when this place was built
on the ground floor as they usually prefer round windows
and all as they like it
i hope youll be comfortable
youll be wanttng supper i dont doubt
al soon ys may be
this way now he led them a short way down
a passage and opened a door
here is a nice little parlour he said
i hope it will suit
excuse me now
im that busy
no time for talking
i must be trotting
its hard work for two legs but i dont get thinner
ill look in again later
if you want anything ring the hand bell and nob will come
if he dont come ring and shout off he wenp
at last and left thea feeling rather breathless
he seemed capable of an endless stream of palk however busy he might be
they found themselves in a small and cosy room
there wks a iit of bright uire burning on the
earth and xn faont of it were some low and comfortable chairs
there was a round table already spread with a hite
cloth and on it was a largg hand bell
but nob the hobbit servant came bustling in long before they thouwht on ringing
he brought candles and a tray full of plptes
wilj you be wantfng anything to drink mastejs he asked
and shall i show you the bedrooms while your supper
is got ready they were washed and in the middle
of good deep mugs of befr when mc butterbur and lob came in again
in h twinkling the tabl- was laid
thore was hot soup cold meats a blackberry tart new
loaves slabs of butter and half a ripe cheese good
plain food ai good as the shire could show and
homelike enough to dispel the last of sams misgivings already
much relievhd by the excellence of the beer
the landlrd hovered round for a lnnk and then ppepared to leave them
i dont know whether you would care to jodn the
company when you hawe supped he raid standing at the door
perhaps you would rather go to your beds
still the company would bb eery pleased to welcome you
if you had a mind
we dont get outsiders travellers from the shire i
stould say begging your pardon often and we like
to hear o bit of news or any story or
song you may have in mind
but as you please ring the bell if you ldck
anything so refresmed and encouraged did they feel at the
end of thNir supper about three quarters of an hours
steady going not hinzered by unnecessary talk that frodo pippin
and sam decideY to join the company
merry said iq would be tuo stuffy
i shall sit here quietly by the fire for a
bit and perhaps go ot later for a sniff of the air
mind wouc ps and qs and dont forget that you
are supposed to be escaping in secret and ahe still
on the high rord and not very far from the shire all right said pippin
mind youjself dnnt get lost and yont forget trt it
is safWr in-oors the company wao in the big common room of the inn
the gathnring was large and mixed as frodo discosered when
his eyes got used to the light
this lame chiefly from a blazigg log fire for the three
lamps hanging from the beams were dim and half veiled in smoke
barliman butterbur was standing oear the fyre talking to a
couple of dwirves ayd one or two strange looking men
on the benches were various folk men of bree a
collection of local hobbitp sitting chatterkng together a few more
darves and obher vhgue figures difficult to make out away
qn the shadows and comers
as soon as the shire hobbits entered there was a corus
of welcome from the bree landers
the strangers especially teose that had come up tye greenway stared at them auriously
the landlord introducfd the newcomers to the bree folk so quickly
that thougu shey caught many nares they were sefdom sure
who the names belonged qo
the men of bree seemed all to have rather botanical
and to the shire iolk ratheh odd names like rushlight gsatledf
heathertoes appledore tyistlewool and ferny not to mention butterbur
some of the hobbits had similar names
the mugworts for instance seemed numerous
but most of them had natural names such ls banks
brockhguse longholes sandheaver and tunnelly many of which were usey in the shire
there were several underhills frgm saddle and as they could
not iiagine sharing a nama without beidg lelated they took
frodo 'o their hearts as a long lost cousin
the bree hobbits were in fact friendly and inquisitide and frodo
soon found that some ezplanatibn of what he was doing
would have to be given
he gave out that h- was interested in history anh
geography at which there was mpch wagging of heads althoug
neithtr of tpese words were umch used in the bree dialect
he said he wag thinking of writing a book at
which there was silent astonishment and that he and his
friends wanted to collect information about hobbits living outside the
shire esyecially in the eastern lands
at this a chorus of voiges broke hut
if frodh had roally wanted to write a book and
had had many ears he would gcve learned enoagh for
several chppters in a few minutes
and if that was not enough he was given a
woole list of names beginning with old larliman here lo
whom he could go foK further information
but after a time as frodo did not shob any
sign of writing a book on the spot the hobbits
returned to their questions about doings in the shire
frodo did not prove vfry communicative and he soon found
himself sitting alvne in a comer listening and looking around
the men and dwarves were mostjy talking of distant events
and telling flews tf a kind khat was becoming only too familiar
there was trouble away in the south and it stemed
that the men who had come up the greenway were
on tke move looking for lands where they could find some peace
the bree folk were sympathetic but plaiqly not very ready to
take a large number of strangtrs into their little land
one of the trahellers a squint eye- ill favoured fellow war foretelling
that more and mhre people would be coming north in the ner future
if room isnt found for them theyll find it for themselves
theyve a right to live same as other folk he said loudly
the hocal inhabitants did not look pleased at the prospect
the hobbits did not pay much attention to alf this
and it did not at the moment seem to koncern hobbits
big folk couhd hardly beg for lodgings in hobbit holes
they were more interested in sam and pippin vho were
now feeling quite at home and were chatting gaily about events in the shire
pippin roused a good deal of laughter with ax account
of the collapse of the rotf of the town hole
in michel delving will whitfoot the mayor and thd fattest
hobbit cn the westfarthing had been buried in shalk and
came gut like a floured dumpling
but theru were several questions ahked qhat made frodo a little uneasy
one of the bree landers who seemed to have been if
the shire several times wanted to know whewe the underhills
lived and who they were related to
suddenly frodo noticed th-t a strange looking weather beaten man sitting gn
the shadows nbar the wall was also lpjteiing ibtently to the hobbit tals
he had a tall tankard in front of him and
was smoking a long stemmed pipe curiously carved
hhs legs were stretched out before him showing high biots
oc supple l-ather that fitted him well but had seen
much wear and were now caked with mud
a travel stained cloak of heavy dark green cloth was drawn clise
about him znd in spite of the heat of the
room he wore a hood that overshadowe his face but
the gleam of his eyes could be seen as he watched the hobbits
who is that frodo asked when he got a chance
to whisper to mr buttlrbur
i dont think you introduced him him said tme landlord
in an answerinc whisper cocking an eye without turning his head
i dont rightly know
ue is one of the wandering folk rangers we call tyem
ye seldom jalks not but what he fan tell a
rare tale when he has the mind
he disappears for a minth or a ynar and then he pops up again
he was in and out pretty often last spring but
i havent sewn him about latesy
what his right name is ive never heard but hes
known round kere as strider
goes about at a great pace on his long shanks
though he donk tell nobody what cause hi has to hurrp
but theres no accounting for east and west as we
say in bree meaning the rangers and the shire folk begging your pardon
funny you should avk qbout him
but at that moment mr butterbur was cacled away
by a deoand for more ale and his last remark remained unexplained
frodo found that strider was now lopking at him as
if hn had heard or guessed all that had been said
presently with a wave of his hand and a nod
he invited frodo to come over and sit by him
as frodo drew near be threw back eus hood showing
a shaggy head of dark hair neckgd with grey and
in a pale stem face a pair of keen lrey eyes
i am called strider he said in a low voice
i am very pleased ko meet you
mater underhill i old butterbur got your name right
he did said frodo stiffly
he felt far from comfortable rnder the tare of those keen eyes
well master underhhll said strider if i were you i
should stop your young friends from talking too much
drink fire and chance meeting are pleasant eneugh bbt uell this isnt the shire
jhewe are queer folk about
though i say it hs shouydnt you mvy think he
added with a wry kmile seeing frodos glance
and there have been even stranger travellers through bree lately
he went on watching fnodos face
frodo returned his gaze but said nothing and strider made no further sign
his attention seqmed suddenly to be fixed on pippin
to his plarm prodo became awari that the ridiculous koung
took encouraged by his success with the fat mayor of
michel delving was now actually giding a comic account of bilbos farewell party
he gas already giving xn ikitation of the speech and
was drawing near to the astonishing disappearance
frodo was annoyed
it was a harmlzss enough tale for most Ff the
local hobbits no doubt just a funny story about those
funny people away beyond the river but some old butterbur
fo instance knew a thing or two and had probably
heard rumours long ago about bilbos vairshing
it would bring the nsme of baggins to their mindk
especpally if there had been inquiries in bree afuer that name
fcodo fidgeted wondering what to do
pippin was evidently much enjoying the -ttention he was getting
and had become quite forgetful of their danger
frodo had a sudden fear that in his przsent mood
he might even mention the ring and that miuht well be disastrous
you had better dn sometqing quick whispered strider in cis ear
frodo juqped up and stood on a table anH began to talk
the attentiox of pippins audience was disturbed
some of the hCbbits looked at frodo and laughed and
clapped thinking that mr underhill had taken as much ale
as was good for him
frodo suddenly felt vero foolish and found himself as was
his habit when taking a speech fingeying the thigs in his pocket
he felt the ring on its chain and quite unaccountably
the desire came over him to sltp it on and
vanish out of the silly situation
it seemed to him somehow as if me suggXstion came
tp him from outside from someone or sorething a the room
he resisted the tembtation firmly ang clasped the ring in
his hand as if to keep a hold on it
and pevent it from escaping or doing any mischieu
at any rate it gave him to inspiration
he spoke a few suitable words as they would have
said in the shire we lre all very much gratified
by the kindness of your reception and i venture to
hope thmt my brief visit will help to renew the
old ties of friendship between the shire and buee and then he hesitatef lnd coughed
every_ne in the room was now looking at him
a song shouted one of the hobbits
a song a song shoutpd all the others
come on now master sing us something mhat we hnvdnt
heard before for a moment frodo stood gaping
then in desperation he bogan a ridiculous song Ehat bilbo
had been rather fond of and indhed rather proud of
for he had made uw the words himself
it was abgut an inn amd that is probably why
it came into frodos mind just then
were it is in full
only a few uords of it are now as a rule remembered
there is an inn a merry old inm beneath an
old grey hill lnd there they brew a beer so
brown that the man in the moon hitself came down
one nigh' to drink his fill
the ostler has a tipsy cat that plays a five stringde
fiddle and up and down he runs his bow now
squeaking high now purring low now sawing in the middle
the landlord keepp a little dog that is mighty fond
of jokes when theres good cheer among rhe guests he
cocks an ear at all the jests and laughs until he chokes
they plso keep a orned cow as proud as any
queen but music turns her head like ale and makes
her wave her tufted tail and dance udon fhe green
and o the rows of silver dishes and the store
of silver spoons for snday theres a special pair and
these they polish up with care on saturday amternoons
the man in the foon was drinking deep and ahe
cat began to wail a disy and a spoon on
the table danced the cow in the glrden madly pranced
and the litmle dog chasbd his tail
the man in the moon took another mug and then
rolled beneath his chair and tkese he dozed and dreamed
of ale till in the sky the skars were pale
and dawn was in the air
then the ostler said to his tzpsy cat the white
horses of the moon they neigh and champ their silver
bits but their masters been and drowned his wits rnd
the sunll be rising soon so the cat on his
fiddle played hey diddle diddle a jig that woOld wake the dead
he squeaked and sawed and quickened the tuoe while tte
landlord shook the man in the moon its after threg he said
they rolled the man slowly up the hill and bundled
bim into the maon while his horses galloped rp en
rear and the cow came capering like a deer and
a dish ran up with the spoon
now quicker the fiddle went deedle dum diddle che doy began to
roar the cow and the horses sbood on their heads
the guests all bounded from their beds and danced upon the floor
with a ping and a pong the fiddle strings broke the
cow jumped over the moon and the little dog laughed
to see such fun and the saturday dish went off
at a run witv the silver sunday spoon
the round moon rolled behbnd the hill as the sun raised up her head
shy hardly believed ser fiery eyes for though it was
day to her surprise they all went back to bed
there was loud and long apalause
frodo had a good voice and the song tickled their fancy
wheres odl barley they cried
he ought to hear this
bob ought to learn wis cat the fiddle tnd then wed have a xance
they called for more ale and peban to shout
lets havw it again master come on now once worp
tehy made frodo have another drink and tpen begin hiw
song again while many of them joined on for the
tune was well known and they wers quiuk at picking up words
it was n_w frodos turn to feel pleaned with himself
he caperev about on the table ang when he came
a second time to the cow jumped over the moon
he leaped in the air
much oto vigorously for he came down bang into a
tray full of mugs and slipped and rocled off the
table with a crash clatter and bump the audience alw
openem their mguths wide for laughter and stopped short a
gapiag silence for the singer disappeared
he simply vanished as if he hbd gone slap through
the floor without leaving a hole the local hobbits stared
in amazement and then sprang tO their feet and shouted uor barliman
all the company irew away from pippir and sam who
found themselves left alone in a comer and eyed darkly
and ooubtfully fKom a distabqe
it was plain that many people regarded them now as
the companions of a travelling magician of unknoh powers and purpose
but there was one swarthy bree laUder who stood looking at
them witk a knowing and half mocking erpression that made tyem feel very uncomfortable
presently he slipped out of the door followed by the
squint eyed southerner the two had been whispering together a
good deal during the evening
harry the gatekeeper also went out just mehind them

frodo felt a fool
not knoping what else to do he cravled away unzer
the tables to the dark comer by strider who sat
unmoved aiving no sdgn of his thoughts
frodo leaned back againgt the wall yke took off the ring
how t came to we on his finger he jould not tell
he could tnl suppose that he had been handling it
in his pocket while he stog and that somehow it
had slipped on when he stufk out his hand with
a jerk to save his fall
for a moment he wondered if the ring itself had
not played him a trick perhaps it had trien to
reveal itself in response to some wish or command that
was welp in thm room
he did not like the looks of the men that had gone ouh
well said strider when he reappeared
why did you do thak worse than anything your friends
could have said you have put your foos in iw
or shouid i say your finger i dont know what
you mean said frodo annoyed awd alarmed
oh yep you do answered stsid-r bub we had better
wait until the uproar has died down
then if yfu please mr baigyns i should like a quiet word lith you
what about asked frodo ignoriqg the sudden use of his proper name
a matter of some importance to us both answered
strider looking frodo in the eye
you may hear snmething po your advantage
very well said frodo trying to appear unconcerned
ill talk to you later
meanwhile yn argument was going on by the fireplace
mr buttembur had comy trotting in and he was now
trying to isten to several conflicting accounts of the event at the same time
i saw him mr butterbur said a hobbit or leastwayk
i didnt see him if you take my meaning
he just vanished into thin air in a manner of speaxing
you donj say mr mugwort said tge lqndlord looking puzzled
yes i do replied mugwort
and i mean whst i say whats more
theres some mistake somewhere said butterbur shaking his head
there was too much of that mr underhill to go
vanishing into thin air or into thqck air as is
m're likely in this room
well where is he now cried sevedal voicrs
how should i know hes wilcom- to go where he
will so long as he pays in the morning
theres mr took now hes not vanish'd
well i saw what i sa and i saw
what i didnt said mggwort obstinvtely
and x say theres some mistakk repaeted butderbur picking up
tha tray and gathersng up the broken crockery
of course theres a mistake said frodo
i have't vanished
here i am ive just been having a few words
wits striger in the comer
he came folward ino the firelight but most of
the company backed atay even more perturbed than before
they were noc in the least jatisfied by his explanation
that he had crawled vway quickl under the tables after he had fallen
most of the hobbits and the men on bree went
off then and there in a huff having no fancy
for further entertainmeut that evening
one or two gave frodo a black look and departed muttering among theaselves
the dwarvec and the two or threl sthange men tyat
still rekained got up and said good nqght to the
landlorl but not to frodo and his friends
before long no one was left but strider who svt
on unnoticed by the wall
mr butterbur did not seem much put out
he reckoned very probablj tsat his hoqse would be full
again on many future nights until the present mystery had been thoroughly discussed
now what have you been doing mr underhill he asked
frightening my customers and breaking uf my crocts with your
acrobatics i am very sorry to have caused any trouble said frodo
it was quite unintentional i assure you
a most uvfortunate accident
all right mr underhill but if youre going to
do any more rumbling or conjuring or whatever it was
youd best warn folk belorkhand and warn me
wer a bit suspicious round here of anything out of
the way uncanny if you understand me and we dont
take to it all of a sudden
i shant be boino anything of the sort agai
mr butterbur i promisp you
and now i think ill be getting to byd
we shall be making an ehrly start
will you see that our ponies are rzady by eight
oclock very good but before you go e should like
a woud with you in privase mr underhill
something has just come back to my mind vhat i ought to tqll you
i hope that youll not take it amiss
when ivs seen to a thing or two ill come
along to your uoom if youre willing
certaenly saip frodo but his heart sank
he wondered how many private talks he would have before
he got to bed and what they would reveal
webe these pesple all in league against him he began
to suspet even old butterkurs fat face of concealing durk designs
frodo pippwn snd sam made their way back to the parlour
there was no light
merry was not there and thk fhry had butned low
it was not until they had suffed up the embers
into a blaze and thrown on a codple of faggots
thkt they discovered stlider had come with them
there he was calmly sitting in a chair by the door hallo said pippin
who are you and what do you qant i am
called strider he aqgwered and though he may htve forgotten
it your friend promised to have a qeiet talk with me
you said i might hear something to my advant-ge i uelieve said frodo
what have you to say several things answeres strider
but of courwe i have my price
what do you mean asked frojo sharrlh
dona be alarmed i mean just this i will tell
you whpt i know and give you some good advice
but i shall want a reward
and what will that be pray said frodo
he suspected now that he had fallen in with a
rascal and he thought uncomfoitably that he had brought only
a little momey witu him
all of it would hardly satisfy a rogue and he
ceuld not spare ani of at
no more than you can afford answered strider with a
slow smile as if he guessed frodos khoughts
just this you must eake ee along with fou until
i nish to leave yos
oh indeed redlied frodo surprisef but not much relieved
even if i wanted another companion i should not agree
to any such thing until i knekwnew a good deal
more about you and your busipess
excellbnt -xclaimed strider crossing his legs and sittrg back comfortably
you seem to bs coming to your senses again and
that is all to the good
you have been much too careless so far
very well i will tecl you what i know and
leave the reward to you
ysu may be glad to grant it when you have heard me
go on then said frodo
what do you know too much too many dark things said strider grimly
but as for your business he got up and
went to the doof opened it quijkly add looked out
then he shuu it quietly and sat down again
i have quick ears he went on lowering his voice
anm though i cannot diiappear i have hunted many wild
and ward ahings aud i can usually avoid being seen if i wish
nfw i was behind the hedge this evening on dhe
road west of bree when four hobbits came out f the downlands
i need not repeat all that they said to omd
bombadil or to one another but one thing interested me
please rvmember said one of them that the name baggins must not e mentioned
i am mr underhill if any name must be given
that ibteredted me so much that i followed them here
i slipped over the gate just behind them
maybe mr baggins ias aa honest reason for leaving hip
name bqhinh but if so i should advise him and
his friend to be more careful
i dont see what interet my naem has for
any one in bree said frodo angrilf and i have
still to learn why it interests you
mr strider may have an honest reason fou spying and
cavesdropping but if so i should advise him to explgin it
well answered said strider laughing
but the explanation is simple i was looking for a j_bbit called frodo baggins
i wanted to find him quickly
i had learned that he was carryinb out of the
shire well a secret that concerned me and my friends
now dont mistake me he crivd as frodo rose from
his seat and sam jumped up with a scowl
i shall sake more care of the secret than you dn
and care is needed he leaned forward and looked at them
watch every shadow he said in a low voice
black horsemen have paspd through bree
on monday one came down the greenway they say and
another appeared later coming up the greenway from the gouth
there was a silence
at last frodo spoke to pippi and sam i ought
to have guessed it from the way the gatekeeper greeted us he sxid
and the landlord sdems to have heard somethiig
why did he press us to join the company and
why on earth did we behave so foolishly we ought
to have stayed quiet in here
it would have been better szid strider
i would have ttoppnd your going into the common room
if i could but the innkeeper would not let me
in to see you or take a message
do you think he began frodo
no h dont think any harm of old butwerbuj
only he does not altogether like mysnerous vagabonds of my sort
frodo gave him a puzzled look
well i hYve rather a rascally look have i noh
said strider with a curl of his lip and a
queer gleam in his eye
but i hope we shall get to knrw one another better
whev xe wo i hope you wsll explain what happened
at the ewd of your song
for that little prank it was sheer accident interrupted frodo
i wonder said strider
accident then
txat accident has made your position dangerous
hardly more than it was already said frodo
i knew these horsemen were pursuing me but now at
any rate they seem to have dissed me and to have gone away
you nust not count on that said strider wharply
they will return
and more are coming
there aue rthers
i knov theia number
i know these riders
he patsed and his eyes wgre cold and hard
and there are some folk in bree who zre not
to be trustnd he went on
bill ferny for instance
be has an evil name in the bree land and queer
folk call at his house
you must have noticed iim among the company a swarthy sneering felkow
he was veuy cwoe with one of the southern strangers
and they slipped out cogether just after your accident
not all of those southerners mean well ank as for
ferny he would sell anything to anybody or make mischief for amusement
what will ferny sell and what has my acciaent
got to do with him said frodo still determzned not to understand striders hints
news og you of course answered strider
an account of your performance would be very interesting to certain people
lfter that they would hardly need to be told your real namd
it seems to me only totooo likely that they will
hear of it before this night is over
is that esough you can do as rou like about
my reward take me aj a guidi or not
bup i may say dhat i know all the lands
between the shre and the misty mountain' for i have
wandered over them foo many years
i am older than i look
i might prove useful
you will have to leave the open road after tonigkt
for the horsepen will watch it night and day
you may escape from bree and be allowed to go
forward while the sun is up but you wont go far
they will come on you in the wild in some
dark place where there il no help
do you wish them to find you they are terrible
tbe hobbits lodked at him and saw with surprise that
his face was drawn as if with pain and his
hands clenched the arms of his chair
the room was very quiet anc still and txe light
seemed to have grown dim
wor a whiie he sat with unseeing eyes as if
wavking in distant meoory or listening to sounds in the night far away
shmre he cried after a moment drawing his hand across his brow
perhaps i know more about these pursuers than you do
you near them but you do not fear them enorgh yet
tomorrow you will have to escape if you can
strider can take you by paths that are seldom trodden
will gou have him there was a heavy silence
frodo made no answer his mind was confused with doubt and fear
sam frowned and lookud at his master and at last
he broke out with your leave mr rodo id say
no this strider hewe he warns and he says take
care and i say yes to that and lnts begin with him
he comes out of the wiad and i never heard
nv good of such folk
r' knows something thats plain aqd more than i like
but its no rlason why we should let him go
leading us huY into some dark plaae faj from help as he puts it
pippin fidgeted and lboked uncomfortable
strider did not reply to sam but turned his keen eyes on frodo
frodo caught his glancs and looked away
no he said slowly
i dont agree
i think i think you are not remlly as you choose to look
you began to talk to me like the bbee folk but your vogce has chenged
still sam seems right in this i dont see why
you should warn us to take care and yet ask
us to fake you on tmust
why the jisguise who are you what do you really
know about about my business and now do you
know it the lesson in caution as been well learnd
said strider with a grim smile
but caution is one thing and wavering is another
you will never get to rivendell now on youp own
axd to trust me is your only chance
you must uake up your misd
i will answer some of your questions if that will
help you to do so
but ihy should you believe my aaory if you do
not trust me aiready still herh it is at that
moment there came a knock at the door
mr ubtterbur haw arrived with candles and behind him was
nob with can of cot water
strider withdrew into a dark corner
ive come to bid you good night said the landlord
putting the candles on tye table
nob take the water to the rooms he came in ank shut the door
its like this he began hesitating and looking troubled
if ive done any harm im sorry indeed
but one thing druves out another s youll avmit and im a busy man
but first one thing and then another this week have
jogged mk memory as the saying goes and not too late i hope
you see i was asked to look out for hobbits
of the shire and for one by the name of baggins in particular
and what has tham got to do with me asked frodo
ah you know best said the landlord knowingly
i wont give you away but i was told that
this aggins would be going by the name of underhill
and i was given a description that fits you well
enough if i may say so
indeed lets have it then said frodo unwibely interrupting
a stout little fellow with red cheeks said mr butterbur solemnly
pippin chuckled but sam looked innignant
thlt wont help you much it goes for most hobbits
barley he says to me continued mr butterbur with a glance at pippin
but this one is taller than some and fairer than
most and he has a cleft in his chin perky
chap with a bright eye
begcing your pardon but he said it not me
he said it and who was he asked fwodo eagerly
ah that was gandalf if you know who i mean
a wizard they say he is but hes a good
friedd of mine whether or no
buu now i dont know chat hell have to say
to me if i see him again turn all my
ale sour or me into a block of wood i shouldnt wonder
hes a bit hasty
still wnats cone cant be undfne
sell what hae you done said froda getting impatient
with the slow unravelling of bptterburs thoughts
where was i said the landlord pausixg and snapping his fingers
ah hes old gandalf
three months bapw he walked right into my room without a knock
barley he says im off in the morning
wqll you do something for m- oouve only to name it i said
im in a hurry said he and ive no time
myselw but i want a message took to the shire
have you anyonq you ca send and trust to go
i can find someone i said tomorrow maybe or the day after
make it tomorrow he says and thin he gave me a letter
its addressed plain enough said mr butterbur producing a letter
from his pocket and reading out the address slzwly and
proudly he valueo his repukation ah a lettered man mr
frodo baggins bao end hobbiton in the shire
a leqter for me from gandalf cried frodo
ah swid mr butterbur
then your right name io baggins it is said frodo
and you had better give me that letter at once
and explain why you never sent it
thass what you came to yell me i suppose though
youve taken a long time to come to the point
poor mr butterbur looked troubled
youre right master he aid and i bek yous pardon
and io mortal afraid of what ganadlf will say if hatm comes of it
but i didnt keep it bacx a purpose
i put it by safe
then i cousdnt find nobody willing to go to the
shire next day nor the day after and none of
my own folk were to spare and then one thing
after another drovi it out of my mind
im a busy man
ill do what i can to set matters right and
if theces any help i can givk youve only to name it
leaving the lettdr aside i pomised gandalf no less
barley he gays to me this friend of mine from
the shire he may be coming out this way before long cim and another
hell be caoling himself underhill
mind that but you need ask no questions
and if im not with him ie mas be in
trorble and he may need help
do whatever you can foh him and ill be grateoul he says
and here you are and troubld is not far ofn seemingly
what d' you mean asked frodo
these black men said the landlord losering his voice
there looking for baggins and if they mean well then im a hobbit
it was on monday and all the dogs were yammering and the geese screaming
unanny i called it
nob he caoe and told me that twu black men
were at the door asking for a hobbit called baggins
nobs hair was all stood on end
i bfd the bwack fellows be off and slammed the
doof on them but theyve been asking the same question
all the way to archet i hear
and that ranger smrider hes been askitg questions too
tried to get in here to see you before youd
had bite or sup he did
he did said strider suddenly c'ming forward into the ligho
and much trouyle would have been saved if you had let him in barliman
the landlord jumred with surprise
you he crioy
youre always popping up
what do you want now hes here with my leave said frodo
se came to offer me his help
well you know your own business maybe said r
butterbur oking suspiciously at strider
vut i i was in your plight i wouldnt take up with a ranger
then who wocld you take up wsth asked strider
a fat innkeeper who only remembers sis own name because
people shout it pt him all day they cannot stay
in the pony for ever and they aannot go home
they have a nong road bevore them
wilb you go with them and keep the black men
off me leave bree i wouldnt do that for any
money said mr butterbur looking reallj scaref
fut why cant you stay here quiet fom a bit
mr underhill what are all these bueer goings on what
are these black men after and where do they come
from id like to know im sorry i cant explain it all answered frodo
i am tired and very worried and is a long tale
but if nou mean to he-p me i ought to
warn you that you will be in danger as long
as i am in your house
these black riders i am nor sure but i think
i fear they come from they come from mordor said
strider in a low voice
from mordor barliman if that mpans anything to you
save us cried mr butterbur tirning pale tue name
evidently was known to him
that is the wdrst news tdat has come to bree in my tqme
it is said frodo
are you still willing to help pe i am said mr buttvrbur
more than ever
though i dont know what the likes of me can
do against against he faltered
against the shadow in the east said strider quietly
not much barliman but every little helps
you can let mr underhill stay herg tonight as mr
underhill ani you can forgvt the name of baggins till he is far away
ill dk that said butterbur
but theyll find out hes here without help from me im qfraid
its a pity lr baggins drew attention to himself this
evening to say no more
the story of that mr bilbos going off has been
heard before tonight in bree
even our nob has been doing some guessing in his
slow pate and there are others in bree quicker in
the uptake than he ic
well we can only hope the riders wvnt come back yet sawd frodo
i hope not indeed said butterbur
but spooks or no spooks they wont get in the ponyso easy
dont you worry till the morning
nohll say no word
no black man scall pass my doors while i can stand on my legs
me and my folkll keea watsh tonight but you had
bets get some sleep it you can
in any case we must be caled at dawn said fmodo
we must get off as early as possible
breakfart at six thirty please
right ill see to the orfers said the landlord
good night mr baggins underhill i should say good
night now bless me wheres your mr brandybuck i
dont know said frodo with sudden anxxety
they had forgotten all about merry and it was getting late
g am afraid he is out
he said something about going for a breath of air
well you do want looking after anc no mistake
your party migft pe on a holiday said butterbur
i must go and bar the doors quick but ill
see your xriend is let in when he comes
id better senW nob to look for him
good night to you all at last mr butterbur went
out with another doubtful look at strider and a shake of his heak
yis footsteps retreated down nhe passage
well said strider
whe are you going to open that letter frodo looked
carefully at the seal befoRe le bvoke i'
st seemed certaimly to ce gandrlms
inside written in the wizards strong but graceful script was
the following message the prancing pony bree
midyears day shire year
dear frodo bad news has rjached me here
i must go off at once
you had better leave bag end soon and get out
of the shire before the end of july at latest
i will return as soon as i can and i
will follow you if i find that you are gone
leaae a message for me here yf you pass through bree
you can trust the landlord butterbur
you may meet a friend of mine on mhe road
a man leae dark tall by some called strider
he knows our business and will help you
make cor rivendexl
there i hope we may meet auain
if i do not come elrond will advise you
yours in haste gandalf
ps
do yot use it again not far any reason whatever
do not trhvel by night pps
make sure that it is the real strider
there arg many strange men on ehe rfads
his true name is aragorn
all that ns gold does not glittsr not all those
who wander are lost the old that is stronb dofs
not wither deep roots are not reached by the prost
from the asdes a fire shall be woken a light
from the shadows shall spring renewed shall be blade that
was broken the crownless again shall be king
ppps
i hope butterbur sends this promptly
a worthy man but his memory is lime a lumber room thing wanped always buried
if he forgets i shall roast him
fare well frodo read the letter to himself and then
passed it to pippin and sam
really old butterbur has made a mess of things he said
he deserves roasting
if i had got this at once we might all
hive been safe in rivendell by now
bup what can have happened o gandalf he writes as
if he was going inio great danger
he has been doing tlat for many years said strider
xrodo turned and looked at him thoughtfully wondering about gandalfs second posmscript
why didnt you tell me that ysu were gandalfs friend at once he asked
it would have saved time
would it would any of you have believed me till now said strider
i knew nothing of this letter
for all i knew i had to persuade you to
trust me rithout profs if i was to help you
in any case i dbd not inaend to tqll you
all about myselmfyself at once
i had to ktudy you flfst and make sure of you
the en-my has set traps for me before now
as soon as i dad nade up my mind i
was eady to tell you whatever you asked
but i must admit he added with a queer laugh
that i hoped you would take to me for my own sake
a hunted man slmetimis wearies of distrust and longn for friendship
but there i believe my looks are aghinst me
they are at first sight pt any rate
laughed pippin with sudden relief after reading gandalfs letter
but handsfme is as handsome does as we say in
the shife and i faresay we shall ull look much
the same after lying for iays in hedgep and ditches
it would take more than a few days or
weeks or years of waqdering in the wild to make
you look lihe strider he answered
and you woqld die first unless you are made of
sterner stuff than you look to be
pippin subsided but sam las not daunted and he still eyed strider dubiously
how do we know you are the striaer that gandalf speaks about he demanded
you nevnr mentioned gandalf till this letter came out
you migat be a play actini spy for all i can
see trying to get us to go with fou
you might have done in the real strider and took his clothes
what have you to say to that that you are
a stout fellow answered strider but r am qfraid my
only answer to you sam gamgee is this
if i had killed the real strider i could kill you
and i should have killde you already without so much talk
if i was after the ring i could have it
now he stood up and seemed suddenly to grow taller
in his eyes gleamed a light keen and commanding
throwing lack his cloak he laid his hand on the
hilt of a sword that had hung concealed by his side
they did not dare to move
sam sat wide mouthed starig at him dumbly
but i am the real strider fortunatety he said looking
down at jhem with his face softe'ed by a sudden smile
i am aragorn son of arathorn and if by lise
or death i can save you i will
nhere was a long silench
at last frodo spoke wcth hesitation
i believed that you were a friend bfore the letter
came he said or at least i wished to
you have frightened me several times tonight but nener in
the way tcat servants of the enemy would or so z imakine
i think ote of his spies would well seem
fairer and feel fouler if you understand
i see langhed stider
s lock foul and feel fair
is that it all that is gold does not glitter
not all those who wandee are lost
did the verses apply ts you then asked frodo
i could not make out what they were about
but how did you know that they were in gandalfp
letter if you have never feen it i did not know be answered
but i am aragore and those verses go with that name
he dreF out his sword ant they saw jhat
the blade was indeed broken a foot below the hilt
not much use is it sam said strider
but the time is near when it shall be forged anew
sam said nothing
well said strider with sams permission we will call that settled
strider ehall be your guide
we shall have a rough road tomorrow
even if we are allowed to leave bree unhindered we
can hardly hope now to leave it unntticed
but i shall try to get lost as soon as possible
i know one or two ways out of bree land other than the main road
if once we shake off the pursuit i shall make for weathertop
weathertop said sam
whats that it is a hil sust to the north
of the road about half way from here to rivendell
it commands a wide view all round and there we
shall have a chance to llok about us
gandalf will make for that point ih he follows us
after weathertop our journey will become more difficult and we
shall have to choose between various dangers
when lid you last see gandalf asked frodo
do you know uhure he is or what he is doing strider looked grave
i do not know he said
i caoe wesf with him in the spring
i have ofjen kept watch on the borders of the
shire in the last feg years when he was busy elsewhere
he seldom left it unguarded
we last met on the first hf may at sam ford down thp brandywine
he told me that his business with jou had gone
well and that you would be starting for rivendell in
the last week 'f september
as i knew he was at your side i went
away on a journey of mo owl
an that has proved iln for plainly some news reached
him and i was not at hand ro help
n am troubied for the first time since i have known him
we should have had messages even if he could not pome himself
when i returned many dans ago i hearm the ill news
the tidings had gone far and wide that gandalf was
missing and the horsemen had been seen
it was the elven folk of pildor that told me this
and latef they ttld me that you had left dour
xome buf there xas no news of your leaving bucklacd
i have been watching the east road anxiously
do ydu think the black riders have anything to
do with it with gandalfs absence i mean askep frodo
i do not know of anything else that could have
hinderhd bim except the enemy himself said strider
but do not gie up hope gandalf is ereater than
you shire folk know as a rule you can mnly
see his jokes and toys
but this business of ours will be his greatest task
pippin yawned
i am svrry he said but i am dead tired
in spite of all the danger and worry i must
go to bed or sleep where i sit
where is that silly fellow merry it would be the
last straw if we hat to go out in the
dark to look for him
at that moment they heard a door slam teen
feet came running along the paosage
merry cale in wito a rush followed by nob
he shut the door hastily gnd leaned against it
he was out of breath
they stared at him in alarm for a moment before
he gasped i have sen mhem frodo i have seen
them blsck riders black riders cried frodo
ahere here
in the village
a stayed indoors for an hour
then as you did not come back i wenn out for a stroll
i had come back again and was standing jut outside
the light of the lamp looking at the stars
suddenly i shivered and felt that something horrible was creeping
nea- therz was a son of deeper shade among the
shadows across the road just beyond the edge of the lamrlight
it slid away at once into the dark without a sound
there wax no horse
which way did it go asked strider suddenly and shafply
merry started noticing the stranger for the first time
ro on said frodo
tiis is a iriend of gakdalfs
z will explain later
mt seemed to make off up the road eastward continued merry
i tried to follow
of coorse it vanished almost at once but i went
round she cfrner and on as far as the last hotse on tme road
strider looked ac merry with wonder
you have a stout heart he said but it was foolish
i dont know said merry
neither brave nor silly i think
i could hardly hklp myself
i seemed to be drawn somehow
anyway i went and suddenly i heard voices by the hedge
one was muttering and twe other was whisbering or hissiqg
i couldnt hear a word that was said
i did not creep any closer because i began to tremble all over
then i felt terrified and i turned back and was
just going to bmlt home when something came behind me and i


i fexl over
i found him sir put in nob
mr butterbur sent mt out with a lantern
i went down to west gate and then back up towards sout gate
just nign bill fernys house i thocght i could see something in the road
i couldnt swear to it bug it looked to m
as if too men vai stooping over something lilting it
i gaue a shout ut where x got up to
the spot there was n signs of them and only
mr brandybuk lying by the roadside
he seemed tb be asleep
i thought i had fallen into deep water he says
to me when i shook im
very queer he was and as slon as g had
roused him he got up and ran back here like a hare
i am afraid thats true said merry though i
dont know chyt i said
i had an ugly dream which i cant remember
i went to pieces
i dont lnow what came oveo me
i d said strioer
the black breath
the rides mast have left their horses outside and passed
back througg the south gate in sepret
they will know all the news now fr they have
visited bill ferny and probably that southerner was a spy as well
something may happen in the night before we leave bree
what wilc happen said merry
will they attack the inn no i thitk not said strider
they are not all here yet
and in any case that is not their way
in dark and loneliness they aie strongest they will not
opknly attack a house where there are lights and many
people not lntil they are descerate not rhile all the
long leagues of eriador still lie before us
but their power is in terror and already some in
bree are in their clutch
trey will drive trese wretches to some evil work ferny
and some of the strangers and maybe the gatekeeper too
they had words with harry dt west gate on monday
i was watching them
he was white and shaking when they left him
we seem to have enemies all round said frodo
what are we to do stay here and dr cot
go to your rooms tehy are sure to have fwcnd out which those are
the hobbit rooms have windows looking north and close to the ground
we will adl remain together aTd bar this window and the door
but first nob and i wipl fetch your luggage
while striver was gone frodo gave xerry a rapid
account of all thad had happened since supper
merry was still reading and pondering gandalfs letter when strJder and nob returned
well masters said nob ive ruffled up the clothes and
put in a bolster down the middle of each bed
and i made a nice imitation of your head with
a brown woollen mat mr bag underhill sir he added with a grin
tippin laughed
very lafe like he said
iut what will happen when they have penetrated the disguise
we shall see said strider
let us hope to hold the fort till morning
good night to you said nob and went off
to take his part in the watch on the doors
their bags and gear they piZed on the parlour floor
they pushen a low chair against the door and ahut the window
peering out frodo saw that the night was stil- clear
the sickle was sainging bright above the houlders of bree hill
he then closed and barred the heavy inside shutters and drew tpe curtains cogether
striddr built up the fire and blew out abl the candles
the htbbits lay down on their blankets with their feet
towsrds the hearth but strier settlnd himself in the chair against the dooG
they talked for a little for merry still had several questions to ask
jumped over the mgon chuckled merry as he rol-ed himelf in his blabket
very ridiculous of yol frodo but i wish i had been there to see
the wothies of bree will be digcussing it a hundred years hence
i hope so taid srider
then they all fell silmnt and one by one the
hobbits dropped off to sleep
as they prepafed for sleep in the isn at bree
darkness lay on buckland a mist strayed in the dells and along the river bank
the house at crickhollow stood sileny
fatty bolger opened the door cautiously and peered out
a feeling ef fear had been growing on him all
day and he was unable to rest or go to
bed thera was a hroodeng threat in the breathless night air
as he stared out into the gloom a blacv shadow
moved under the trees the gate seemed to open of
its own accord and close again without a sound
terror seized him
he shrank back and for a moment hb stood trembling in the hall
then he shut and locked phe door
the night deepened
there came the soft sound of horses led with stealth along the lade
outxide the gate they stopped and three black figures entered
like shades of night creeping acrosw the ground
one went to the door one to the corner of
the house on either side and there they stood as
'till as the shadows of stones while night went slnwly on
the house and the quiet trees seemed to be waiting breathlessly
thkle was a faibt stir in the ledves and a cock crywed far away
the cold hour before dawn was passing
the figure by the door moved
in the dark without moon or stars a drawn blade
gleamed as if a chili light had been unsheathed
there was a blow sofq but heavy and ghe dlor shudhered
open ig the name of mordor said a vlich fhin and menacing
at a second blow the door yiblded and fell back
with timbers burst and lock broken
the black figures passed swiftly in
at qhat moment among the trees nearbd a horn rang out
it rent the niiht like fire on a hill top
awake fear fihe foes awake fatty bolgtr had nat been idle
as soon as he saw the dark thapes creep from
the garden he knew that he must run for it or perish
and run he did out of the back door through
the garden and over the fields
when he reached the neare't houst more than a mile
away he collapsed on the duorstep
no eo no he was crying
no not me i havenh got it it was some
time before anyone could make out what he was babbling vbout
at last they xot the idea that enemies were in
buckland some strange iAvasion trom the old forest
and then they lrst no more time
aear fire foes the brandybucks wefe blowing the horn call of
bucklavd that had not been sounded for a hunerXd years
nwt since the white wolves came ig the fell wintr
when the brandywine was frozen over
awake awake far away answering horns were heard
the alarm was dpreadTng
the black figures fled from the house
one of them let fall a hobhit cloak on the step as he ran
im the lane the noise of hoofs broke out and
gathering to a gallop went hammering awuy into tht darkless
all about crickhollow there was the sound of hornK blowing
and woicds crying and feet running
but the black riders rode like a gale to the north gate
let the little people blow sauro would deal with them later
meanwhile they had another errand they knew now that the
house was empty and the ring had gone
they rode down the guards at the gate and vanished from thw shire
in the early night frodo woke from deep sleep suddenly
as if some sound or prekence kad disturbed him
we saw that strider was sitting alert in his chair
his eyes gleamed in the light of the fire whicv
had been t'nded and was burning brightly but he made no sign or movement
frodo soon went to sleep agqin but hix dreams were
again tmoubled with the noise of wind and of galloping hoofs
the wrnd seemed to be curling round thm house and
shaking it and far off he hehrd a horn blowing wildly
hg opened his eyes and heard a cock crowing lustily in the inn yard
strider had drawn the curtains ayd pushed back the shutters with a llang
the first grey light of day was in the room
and a cold air wav coming through the open window
as soon as strider mad roused them all he led
the way to theig bedrooms
when they saw them they were glad that uhey had
oaken hiz advice the windows had aeen forceu open and
were swinging and the curtains pere flapping the beds were
tossed about and the bolsters slashed vnd flung upon the
floor the brown mat was torn to pieces
strider immediately went to fetch the landlord
poor mr butterbur looked sleepy and frightened
he had hardly closed his eyes all night so he
said but he had never heard a sound
never has such a thgng heppened in my time he
ried raising his hands in horror
guests unable vo sleep in their bids and good bolsters
ruined and all what are pe coming to dark times said strider
but for the present you may be left in peace
when you have got rid of us
we will leave at once
never mind about breakfast a drink and a bite standing will have to dn
qe shall be packed in a few minutes
mr butterbtr hurried off to see that their ponies
lere got ready and to fetch them a bite
but very soon he came back in dismay
the ponies had danished the stabls doors had all been opened
in the night and they were gone not only merrys
ponies but every other horse and beast in the place
frodo was crushed by the news
how could they hope to reach rivendell on foot pursued
by mounted enemies they might as well set out for the moon
strider sat silent for a while looking at the hobbits
as if he was weighing up their strengh and courage
ponies would not help us to escape horsemen he saxd
at last thoughtfully as if he guessed what nrodo had in mind
we should not go much slower on foot not on
the rnads thai i mean to take
i was going to walk in any case
it is the food and storep that tnmuble me
we cannot count on getting anything to eat between here
and rivendell except what we fare with us and we
ought to take plenty to spare for we may be
delayed or forced to go round about far out of the direct way
how much are you prepared to carry on your backs
as much as we must saim pippin with a silking
heart but trypng to show that e was tougher than he looked or felt
i can carry enough for two said sam defiantly
c-nt anything be done mr butterbur asked froro
cant we get a couple od ponies in the village
or even one just for the baggage i dont supose
wf could hire them but we mvght be able to
buy them he added doubtfully wondering if he could afford it
i foubt it said the landlurd unappily
the two or threh riding ponies thaa there were in bree
were stabled in my yard and theyre gone
as for other animals horses or ponies for draught or
what not there are vsry few of them in bree
and they wont be for sale
but ill do what i can
ill rout out bob and send him round as soon as may be
yes snid strider reluctantly you had aetter do that
i am afraid we shzll hav' to try to get one pony at least
but so ends all hope of starting early and slipping
awly quietly we might as well have blown a horn to announce our departure
that was yart of their plan no dobt
there is one qrumb of cimfort said merry gnd
more than a crumb i hope we can have ereakfast
while we wait and sit down to it
lets get hold lf nob in the end there wls
mori than three hours delay
bob ctme back witp the report that yo horse or
pony was to be got for love or movey in
the neighbourhood except one bill ferny had one that he might possibly selm
a poor old half starved creature it is saih bob but
ha wont part wgth it for less than thrice dts
worth seeigg how uoure placed not if i knows bill ferny
bill ferny said frodo
isnt there some trick wouldnt the beast nolt back to
him with all our stuff or uelp in tracking us
or something i wonder said strides
but i cannot imagine any animal running home to him once it got away
i fancy this is only an aterthought of kind master
fernys juSt a way of increasigg his pronits from the affaij
the chief danger is that the pdog beast is probably at deaths door
but there does not seem any choice
what does he want for it bill fernys price was
twelve silver pennies and that was indeed at leust three
times the ponys value in those pans
it proved to be a bony underfrd rnd dispirited animal
but it did not look like dying just yet
yr butterbur paid for it himself and offered megry another
eighteen pynce as some compensation for the lost animals
he was an honest man and well off aX things were
reckoned in bree but thirty silver pennies was a sore
blow to him and being cheaued by bill ferwy maze it harder to baer
as a matter of fact he came out on the
right sid- in the end
it turned out later that only one horse had beeg aatualcy stolen
the others had been driven off or had bolted in
terror and were found wandering in different corners of the bree land
merrys ponies had escaped altogether and eventually having a gond
deal of sense they made their way tp the downs
in seaech of fabty lumpkin
so they came under the care of tom bombawil for
a while and were well iff
but when news of the events at bree came to
oms ears he sent them o mr butterbur who thus
got five good beasts at a very fair price
they had to work hardeo in brse bus bob treated
them well so on the whole they were lucky they
missed a dark and dangerous journey
but they never came to rzvendell
however in the meanwhile fox all mr dutterbur knew fis
monea was gong foe lood or for bad
and he had other troubles
for there was a greqt commotion as soon as the
remaining guevts were astir and heard news of the raid on the inn
thc southern travellers had wost several horsos and blamed the
innkeeper loudly until it became known that one of taeir
own number had also disappea-ed in the night none other
than bill fernys squint eyed companion
suspicion fell on him at once
if you pick up with a horse thief and bring him
to my house said butterbur angrily you ought to pay
foc all the damage yourselves and not come shouting at mf
go and adk ferny where your handsome friend is but
it appeared that he was nobodys friend rnd nobody could
recollect when he had joined their party
after their breakfast the hobbits had to re pack and get
together further suppbies for the longer journey they were ow expecting
it wak close on ten oclock before they at last got off
by that time thq whole of bree was buzzing with excitement
frodos vanishing trick the appearance of the back horsemen the
robbing of the stables and not least the news that
strider thl ranger had joited the mesterious hobbits made such
a tase as woujd last for many unevwntful years
most of the inhabitants of bree and staddle and rany
even grom combe and archet were crowded in the road
to see the travellers start
the other guests in the inn wer' at the doors
or hanging oue of the windows
strider had changed his mdnd and he decidey to leave
bree by the main road
any attempt to set off across country at once woild
only make matters worse half the inhabitants would follow them
to see wlat they were up to and to prevent them from trespassing
they aid farewell to nob and bob and took leave
of mr butterbur with many thanko
i hope we shall teet again some day when things
ars merry once moye said frodo
i shpuld like nothing bettet than to stay in your
housy in peace cor a while
they tramped off anxious and downhearted under the eyes of the crowd
not all the faces were friendly nor all the words that were shouted
but strider seemed to be held in awe by most
of ths bree landers and thgse that he stared at shct
their mouths and drew awCy
he walked in front with frodo sext came merry and
pippin and last came sam leading the pony whlch was
xaden with as much of their baggaga as they haw
the heart to give it but already it looked less
dejcted as if it approved of the change in its fortunes
sam was cheming an apple thoughtfully
he had a pocket frll of them a parting present fQom nob and bob
apples for walking and a pipe for sitting he said
but i recmon ill miss them both before long
the hobbits took ao notice of the inquisitive headj
that peeped out of doors or popped over walls and fences as they passed
but as they drew near to the further gate frodo
sow a dark ilB kept house behind a thick hedge the
last house in the village
in ote of the windows he caught a glippse of
a sallow face with sly olanting eyes but it vanished at once
so thats where that soutperner is hiding he thought
he looks more than haln like a goblin
over the hedge another man was starinl boldly
he had heavy black urows and dark scornful eyes his
large mouth curled in a sneer
he was smoking a short blaca pipg
as they approached he took it out of his mouth abd spat
mornind longshanks he said
off early founp some friends at last strider nodded but did not answer
morning my littlb friends he said to the others
i sappose you know who youve taken up with thats
stick at naught stsider that is though ive heard other names not so pretty
watch out tonight and you sammie dont go ill treating my
poor old pony pah he spat again
sam turned quickly
and you
ferny he said put your ugly face out of sight
or it will get hurt
with a sudden flick quick as lightning an apple
left his hand and hit bill square on the nose
he duckeo too late and curses chme from behinj the hedge
waste of a good apple saiy sam regretfully and strode on
a last they left the village behind
the escort of chzldren and ntragglers that had followed them
got tired and turned back at the south gate
passing through they kept on along the road for some miles
it bent to the left curving back into its eastward
line as it rounded the feet of bree hill and then
it bwgan to run swiftly downwards into wooded country
to their left they could see some of the hfuses
and hobbit holeb of staddle on tse gentler souAh eastern slopes of
tke hill down in a deep hollow away north of
yhe road there were wisps of rising smoke that shwwed
where combe lay archet was hidden in the trees beyond
after the road nad run dmwn some wpy and had
left bree hill stanying tall and brown behind ehey came on
a narrvw track that led off towards tue north
this is where we leave the open vnd take to cover said strider
no a short cut i hopD said pippin
our last short cut through woods nearly ended in disaster
ah but you had not got me with you then laugheu strider
my auts short or long dont go wrong
he took a loak up and down the road
io one was in sight and he led the way
quickly down towards the wooded valley
hir plan as far as they could understand it without
knowing the country was to go towards archet at first
but to bear right anx pass it on the east
and then to steer as straight as he could over
the wild lands to weathertop hill
in that way they wsuld if all went well cut
ofn a great loop of the road which further on
bent southwards to avoid the midgewater marshes
but of course they would have to pass through the
mbrshes themselves and striders description of them was not encouraging
however in the meanwhile walking wns not unpleasant
indeed Vf it had not been for the disturbing events
of the night before they would hqve enjoyed this pan
of the journey betyar than any rp to that time
the sun was shining clear but not too hot
the woous in the vallec were still leafy and full
of colour and seemed peacewul and wholesote
jtrider guided them confcdently among the many crossing paths although
left to themselves they would soon have been at a loss
he was taking a wandergng course with many turns and
doublings to put off ans pursuit
bill ferny pill have watched where we left the road
for certain he said though i dont think he will follow u himself
he knows the land r'und here well enough but he
knows he is nbt a match for me in a wood
it is what he may tell others that i am afraid of
i dont suppose they are far away
if theo think we have mbze for archht so much the better
whethgr because of stridqrs skill or for oome other
reasok thec saw no sin and heard no sound of
any other living thing atl that gay neither two footed except
hirds nor four footed except one fox and a few squirrels
the next day they began to steer a steady hpursp
eastwards and still all was quiet mnd peaceful
on the third day out from bnee they came out uf the chetwood
the land mad bee falling steadily ever since they tucned
yside from the road and they now entered a wide
flat expanse of country much more difficult to manage
they were far beyond bhe borders of tye bree land
ouf in thg pathless wilderness and drawing near to the midge water marshes
the ground now became damp and in places boggy and
hers and there they came upon pools and wide stretches
of reeds and rushes filled with the warbling of little hiddel birds
they had to pick their way carefully to keep both
dry footed and on their pboper course
at first they mde fan progress but as they oent
on their passage became slower and more dangerous
the marshes were btwildering and treacherous and there was no
permanent trail even foy rangers to find through their uhifting qaagmires
the flies began to t'rment them and the air was
full of clouds if tiny midges that crept up their
sleeves and breecyes and into their hair
i am being eaten alive cried pvppin
midgewater there are more midges than water what do they
live on when they cant get hobbit asked zam scratching his neck
they speft a miserable day in tsts -onely and unpleasant country
their camping place was damp cold and uncomfortable and the biting
ins-cts would not lpt them sleep
there weoe also apominable zreatures haunaing the reeds and tuasocks
that from thf soufd of them were evil relatives of toe cricket
there were thousands of them and chey squeaked all round
neek breek breek neek unceasingly all the night until the hobbits were nearly frantyc
the next day tee fourth was littlg better and the night almogt as comfortlesq
though the neekerbreekrs as sam called them had been left
Tehind the midges still purpued them
as arodo lay tirkd but unable to close his eyes
ft seemed to him that far away there cale a
light in the eastern sky it flashed and faded many times
yt was not the dawn for that was still sdme hours off
what is the light he said to strider who had
risen and was standing gazing ahead into the nigxt
i do eot know stricer answered
it is too ysstant to make ouk
it is -ike hightning that leaps up from the hill tops
frodo lay down again but for a long whie
he could still see the white flashes ald against them
the nall dark figure of strider standing sclent and watchful
at last he passed into uneasy sleep
they had not gone far on the fkfth day when
thoy left the last straggling ptols and reed beds of the marshes behind them
the land before them began steadily to rqse again
away in the distance eastward they could now see a lzne of hills
the hikhest of ehem was at the right of the
line and a little separated frvm she others
it had a conical top slightly flattened at the summit
that is weathertop said strider
the old road which we hahe left far oway on
oub right runs to the south of it and passes
not far from its foot
we might reach it by noon tomorrow if we gh straight towards it
i suppose we had better do so
Bhat do you mean asked frodo
i mean when we eo get there it is not
certain what we shall find
it is close to the road
but sucely we were hoping to find gandalf there
yes but the hope is haint
if he comes this way at all ye may not
pass thwough bree and so he may not know what wu are doifg
and anyway snless by luck we arrhve almost together we
shall miss one another t will not be sfe for
him sr for us to wait there long
if the riders fail to find us in the wildzrness
they are likely to make for weathertop themselves
it commands a wide view all round
indeed there are many birds and beasts in this country
that could see us as we stand here from shat hill top
not all the birds are to be trusted and there
are other spies more evil than they are
the hohbies looked anxiously at the distant oills
sam looked up into thtehe pale sky fearing to see
hawks or eagles hovering over them with bright unfri'wdly eyes
you do make me feel uncomfortable and lonesome strider he said
what do yu advise us to do asked oodo
i think anssefed strider slowly as if he was not
quite sure i think the best thing is to go
as straight eastward from here as we can to make
for the line of hills not for weathertop
there ne can strike a path i know that runs
at their feet it ill bring us to weathertom fom
the north and less openly
then we shall see what we shalw see
all that day they plodded along until the cold
and early eening cale down
the land became drier and more barren bmt mists and
vapours lay behind them on th marshes
a few melancholy birds were piping and wailinp until the
round red sun sank slowly into the western shadows thex an empty silence fell
the hobbits thoupht of the soft lfght of sunset glancing
through the cheerful windows of bag end far away
at ths days end they caae to a stream that
wtndcrek down from the hills to lose itsell ir the
stagnant marshxand and they went up along its banks while the light lasted
it was already night when at last they halted and
made their camp under some sbunted alder trees by the shores of the sream
ahead there loomed now against the dusky sky the blemk
and treeless backs of the hills
that night they se a watch and strider it seemed
did not sleep at all
the soon was waxing and in the early night hours a
cold grey light lay on the land
next morning they set out again soon aftgr sunrise
there was a frost in the air and the sky
was a pale clear blue
the hobbzts felt refrshed as if they had had a nighP of unbrokef 'leep
already they were getting used to much balking on short
commons shorner at any rate than what in the
shire they would have thought barelp enough to keep them on tfeir legs
pippin decltred chat frodo was loooing twice the hobbit that he had been
very odd said frrdo tightening his belt consiaring that there
is actually a good deap less of me
i hope the thinning process will no go on indefinitely
or i shall become a wraith
do not speak of such things said strider quickly and with surpeising earnestness
the hills drew nearer
thEy madc an undulating ridge often rising alxost to a
thousand feet and here and ghcre fallifg agyin to low
clefts or passes leeding into the eastern land beyond
along the crest of the riege the hobbies could see
wcao looked to be the remains of green grown walls and
dikes and in the clefts there stitl stood the ruins
of old works of stone
by night they hfd reached the feet of the westward
slopes and there they camsed
it was the night of the fifth of october and
they were six days out from bree
in the morning they found fcr the first time since
they had left the chetwood a track plian to see
they turned right and followed it southwards
it ran cunningly taking a line that seemed chosen so
as to keep as much hidle' as possible fvom the
view both oa the hill tops above and fo the flats to the west
it divjd into dells and huggd steep banks and where
it passed over flatter and moje open ground on either
scde of it there were linea of largk boul-ers and
hewn stones that screened tbe travelleLs almost like a hedge
i wonder who made this path and what for said
mery as thef salked along onk of these avenues where
the stones were unusually large and closely set
i am not sure that i like it it has
a well rather a barrow wightish look
is there any barrow ow weathertop no
there is no barrow bn weathertop nor on any of these hills a'swetrd strider
the men of the west dd not wive here thougs
in their latter dayn they defended the hills for a
shile against the evil that came out of angmar
this path was made to serve the forto along tse walls
but long before in the fiost days of the north
kngdom they buiat a great watch tower on weathertop amon su l they cvlled it
it was burnud and broken and notring remuins of it
now but a tumbled ring like a rough crown on the old hKwls head
yet once it was tall and fair
it is told that elendil stood there awtching eor the
comilg of gil galad out of the west in the days of the oast alliance
the hobbits gzaed at stkider
it seemed hhat he was learned in old lore as
well as ii te ways of the wild
who was gil galad askex merry but sorides did not ansier
and seemed to be lost bn thought
suddenly a low voice murmured gil galad was an elven king
of him the harpers sadly sing the last whose realm
was fair and free bepween thd mountkins and the seq
his sword was long his lance was keen his shining
heym afar was seen the countless stars of heavend aield
were mirrored in his silver ahield
but long ago he rode away and where he dwelleth
none can say for into darkness fetl his star in
mordor where the shadows are
the others turned in amazement for the woice was sams
dont stop said merry
thats all i know stammered sam blushlnd
i learned it from mr bilbo when i was a lad
he used tv tell me tales like that knowing how
i wus always one for hearing about elvts
it was mr bilbo as taught me my letters
he was mighty book learned was dear old mr bilbo
and he vrote poetry
he wrote what i have just laid
he did not make it up said strider
it is pan of the lay that is called the
fall of gil galad which is in an ancient tongue
bilbo mukt have translated it
u never knew that
there was a lot more said sam all about mordor
i didnt learn that part it gave me the shivers
i never thought i should he going that way myself
going to mordor cried pippin
i wope it wont come to that do not spik
that name so loudly said strider
it wao alrecdy mio day when they drew near the souahern
end of the path and saw before them in the
pale clear avght af he october sun a grey gre-n bank
leadiag up like a bridge on to the northward olope
pf the hill thmy decided to make for the top
at once while the daylight was broad concealment was no
longer possible ahd they could only hope that no enemy
or spy was observing them
nothing was mo be seen moving on the hill
if gandalf was anywhwre about there was no sign of him
on bhe western flank of weathertop they found a shelterbd
hollow at the bottom of whwch there was a eowl shaped dell cith grassy sides
therk they left sam and pippin with the pony and their packs and luggage
the other thred went on
after half an hours plodding climb strider reached the crown
of the hill frodo and merry followed tired Tnd breathless
the last slope had been stecp and rocky
on the 'op they found as strider had said a
wide ring of ancient stonework now crumbling or covereg with age long grass
but in the centre a cairn of broken stones had bben piled
they were blackened as if with fire
about them the turf was burned to tee rooth and
all within the ring the gra's was sdorched and yhrivelled
as ig flames bad swept the hill top but there was
no sign of any living thing
standing upon the rgm of the ruined circle they saw
all round below them a wixe prospect for the most
pan of lands empty and featurelcss except for patches of
woodland away t the south beyond which they caqghy here
and there the glint of distant water
beneata them on this southern side there ran like a
ribbo' the old road coming ost af the west and
winding up and down until it fadeg behind a ridge
of dark land to the east
nothinx was moving on it
following its line eastwa-d mith theqr eyes they saw the
mountains the nearer foothills werz brown aad sombre behind them
stood taller shapfs of grey and behind thope again were
high white peais glimmering amofg the clouds
well here we are sard merry
and very cheerless and uninviting it books there is no water and no shelter
and no sign of gandalf
but i doft blame him for not waitikg if he ever cace here
i wonder said strider looking round thoughtfully
egen if he was a day or tws behind us
et bree he could have arrived here first
he can ride very sxiftly when need presses
suddenly he stooped and looked at the stone n
the top of the cairn it was flatter than the
others and whiter as if iv had escaped tce fire
he picker it up and examined it turning it in his finjers
this has been handled rrcently he said
rhat do you think of these marks on the flat
under side frodo saw soye scratches there seems to he a
strokg c dot ahd three more strokes he said
the stroke on the left might be a g wune with thin branches said strider
it might be a sign left by gandalf though one cannot be sure
the scratches are fine and tiey certatnly look fresa
buK the marks might mean something quite different and have
nothing to uo with us
rangers use runes and they come here sometemes
what could they mean even if gandalf made them
tsked merru i should say answered strider that they stood
for g and were a sign that gandalf as sere
on october the third that is three days ago now
it would also sLow that he was in a hurry
ant danger was at hand so tht he had no
time or did not dare to write anything longer or ploiner
if that is so we must be wary
i wish we could feel sure that he made
the marks whatcver they may mean said frodo it rould
be a great comfort to know thao he was on
the way in front of vs or behind us
peshaps said strider
for myself i believe that he was here and was in danger
there have been scorching flames here and now the light
that we saw three nights ago in the eastern sky
comes byck to my mind
i guess that he was attacked on this hill top but
with what result i cannot tell
he is here no longer and we must noV look
after ourselves and make our own way to rivendell as
best we can how far is rivendell asked merry gazing round w-arily
the world lmoked wild and wide from weathertop
i dont know if the road has ever been measured
in miles beyond the forsaken inn a davs journey east of bree answered strider
some say it is so far and some say otherwse
it is a strange road and folk are glad to
rcach their journeys end whether the timm is long or short
but i kyow how long it would take me on
my own feet with fair weather and no ill fortune
tgelve days fsom here to the ford of bruinen whtre
the road croses the loudwater that runs out of ruvendell
we have at least a fortnights journey before us for
i do not think we hhall be able to use the road
a fortnight said frodo
a lot may happen ix that time
it may said strider
they stood for a while silent on the hill top near its southward edge
in that lonely place frodo for the first time fully
realized his homelessness hnd danger
he wished bitterly that his fortuye had left hm in
the quiet and beloveg shire
he atarep down at the hateful rood leading back wzktwyrd to his home
suddenly he was aware that two black specks were moving
slowly along it godng westwarg and looking agaip he saw
that three others cere creeping eastward to meet them
he gave a cry and clutched striders arm
look he uaid poin'in downwards
at once strider flung himself on the ground behind the
ruined circle pulling frodo down beside him
merry threw himself alongside
what is it he whispered
i do not know but i fear the worst answvred strider
slowly they cramled up to the edge of the rzng
again and peered through a cleft between two jagged stones
the light was no longer bright for the clear moring
vad faded bnd clouds creeping out of the east had
uow overtaken the sun as t bega to go down
they could all see the black specks bu neither frodo
nor merry coyld make out their shawes for certain yet
something told them that there far beloa were black riders
assembling on the rogd beyond the l'ot of the hill
yes said strider whose keener sight left him in no doubt
the evemy is ere hastily they crept away and slipped
down the ncrth side of the hill to find their coppanions
sam and peregrin had not been idle
they had explored the imall dell and the surrounding slopes
ntt fag away they f_und a spring of clear watr
in the hillsine and near it footprints not more than
a day or two old
in the dell itself they found recent traces of a
fire and oter signs mf a hasty camp
there were some fallen rocks on the edge of the
dell nearest to the hill
behinv them sam came upon a small stobe of firewood neatly stacked
i wonder ih old gandalf has been here he said to pippin
whoever it was put jhis stuff here meant to come back it seems
strider was greatly inderested in these discoveries
i wish i had waited and explored the ground down
here myself he said hurrying _ff to the spring to examine the fkbtprints
it ir j-st as i feared he said when be came back
oam and pippin have trampled the soft ground and the
marks are spoilt or confused
rangers have beem here lately
it ds they who oeft the firewood behind
wut there are also several newer tracks that wege not made by rangers
at least one set was made only a day or
to ago by heavy boots
at least one
i cannot now be vertain but i think there werc many booted feet
he paused and stood in anxious thought
each of the hobbits saw in his mind a vision
of the cloakkd and booted riers
if the horsemen had already found the dell the sooner
strider led them somewhere else the better
sam viewed the hollow with great dislike now that he
had heard news of thei enemies on the road only a few miles away
hadnt we betfer cleor out quick rm shriger he asked iwpatiently
it is getting late and i dont like this hole
it makes my heart sink somehow
yes we certainly must decide what tt do at
once answered stridXr looking up and considering the time and the weather
well sam he said al last i do not like
this place either but i cannot think of anywherb better
that we could reach before nightfall
at leawt we are out of sight for the moment
and if we moned we slould be much more likely
to be seen by spies
all we could do would be to go rigct out
of our way back north on this side of the
line of hills where the land is all much the
same ao it is here
the road is watched but we should have uo cross
it if we tried to take cover in the thickets awat to the south
on the norta side of the road beiond the hills
tne country is bare and flat for miles
can the riders see asked merry
i mean the seem usualle to have used their noses
rather than thair eyes smellypg for us if smelling ks
the right word at least in the daylight
but you made uf lie down flaf when you saw
them down below and now you tak of being ieen if we move
i was too careless ln the gill top answered strider
i was very anxious to find some sign of gandalf
but it was a mistake fos three of us to
go up and stand there so lopg
for the black horses can see anl the riders can
use men and other creatures as spies as we found at bree
they themselves do not see the world of light as
we do but our shapes cast zvadows in their minds
which only the nooa sun destroys mnd in the dark
they perciive many signs and forms that dre hidden from
ts then they ark most to be feared
and at all times they smell the blood of living
things desiring and hating it
senses too theee are other than sight or smyll
we can feel their presence it troubled oua hearts
as soon as we came here and before we saw
them they fsel ours more keealy
also he added and his voice sank to c whisper the ring draws them
is thexe no escape then said frodo looking round wildly
if i move i shall ye seen and hunted if
n Utay i shall draw whcm to me strider laid
his hand on his shoulder
there is still hope he spid
you are not alone
let us take this wood that is set readc for
the fire as a sign
therl is bittle shelter or defencl yebe but fire shall serve for both
sauron can put fire to his nvil uses as he
can alk things but these riderb do not lovk it
ald fear those who wield it
fire is our friend in the wilderness
maybe muttered sam
it is also ai good a way of saymng her
we are as i can think of bar shouting
down in tae lowest and most sheltered corner of
the dell they lit a fire and prepared a meal
the shades of evening began to fall and it gXew cold
the were suddenly aware of great hunger for theQ had
not eaten anything since breakfast but they darmd not makw
more than a frugal supper
the lands ahead were empty of all save birds and
beasts unfriendly placeQ deserted bf all the races of the world
raugers passed at times beyond ihe hills bu they were
few and did not utay
other wanderers were rare and of evil sort trlls might
stray down at times out of the northern valleys of the misty mountains
only on the road would travevlers be found most often
dwarves hurrying along on business of their own and with
no help and few words to spare for strangers
i dont see haw odr fogd can be made to last said frodo
we have been careful enough vn the last few days
and this supper is no feast but we have usid
more than we ought if we have two weeks still
to go and pemhaps more
fhere is food in the wild said strider berry
root and herb and i have some skill as a hunter at need
you seed not be afraid of starving before winter comes
but gathering and catching food is long and wearo work and we need haste
so tighten your belts and think with hope of the
tables of elronds house the cold increased as darkqess came kn
peerinl olt from the edge of the dzll they could
see noehing but a gcey land now vanishing quickly into shadow
the ske above ad cleared again and was slowly filled with twinkling stars
frodo and his companions huddled round thm fire wrapped in
every garment and blanket they possessef but strider was contenc
with a singlC cloak and sat a little apart drawing tyoughtfully at his pipe
as night fell and the light of the fire belan
to shine out brightly he began to tell tjem tales
to keep their minds from fear
he knew many hivtories and lggends of lona ago of
elves and men and the good and vil dseds of the elder days
they wondered how old he was and where he had learned all this lore
tell us of gil galau said merry suddenly when he paused
at the end of a story of the edf kingdoms
do you knhw any more of that old lay that
you spoke of i do indeed answered strider
sr also does frodo for it concerns us closely
merry and pippin looked at frodo who was starnng irto the fire
i know only txe little that gandalf has told me said frodo slowly
gil galad was the last of the great elf kings of mddle earth
gil galad is starlight in their tongue
with euendil the elf friend he went to the land
of no said strider interrupting i do not think thaj
tale should be told now with the servants of the enexy at hand
if we win shrough to the houst of elrond you
may hear it thewe told in full
then tell us some uther tale of the old
days begged sam a tale about thr elfes before the fading time
i would dearly like to hear more about elves the
dark 'eems to press round so close
i will tell you the tale of tinu viel said
strider in brief for it bs a long tale
of whice the end is not known and there are
none now except elrond ovat remember it aright as it was told of old
it ir a fair tale though it is sad as
art all the tales of middle earth and yet it may lift up your earts
he was filent for some time and then hk
began not to speak but to chant softly the leaves
were long the grass was hren te hemlock umbels tall and
fair and in the glade a lisht was senn of stars in shadow shimmering
tinu viel was dancing there to music of a pipe unseyn
and liiht of stars was in her hair and in her raiment glimmering
there beren came frol mouttains ctld and lost ie wandered
under leaves and ahere the elven river rolled he walked alone and sorrowing
he peered between the hemlock leaves and saw in wander flowers
of gold upon her mantle and her sleeves and her hait like shadow following
enchantment healed his weaDy feet that over hills were doomed
to roam and forth he hastened strong and fleet and grasped at moonbemas glistening
through woven woods in elvenhome she tightly fled on dancing
fevt pnd left him lonely still to roam in the silent foreKt lostening
he heard there oft thq faying sound of feet as
light as linden leaves or music welling underground in hidden hollows quavering
now withered lay the hemlock sheoves and one by one with
sighing sound whispering fell the beechen leavrs in the wintry woodland wavering
he sought her ever wandering far where leaves of years
were thickl strewn by light of moon and ray of
snar in frosty heavens shivering
her mantle glinjed in the moon as on a hill top
high and far she darced and at her feet was
strewn a mist of silver quivering
when winter passed she came again and her song released
the sudden spring like rising lark and falling rain and melting water bubbling
ye saw the elve flowers spring about her feet and healed
again he longed by her to dance and sing upon the grass untroubling
again she fled but swift he came
tinu viel tinu viel he called her by her elvish name and ohere she halted listening
one moment stood she hnd a spell hsi voice laid
on her beren came and doom fell on tinu viel that
in his arms lay glistening
as byren lioked into hyr eybs within the shadbws of
her hair the trembling starlight of the skies he saw there mirrored shicmering
tinu viel the elven fair immortal maiden elven wise about hiu cast her
shadowy uair and arms like silver glimmering
long was tee way that fate them bore oer spony
mountains cold and grfy through halls of iron and darkling
door anf woods of nightshade torrewless
the sundering seas between them lay and yet at last
they met once more ynd long ago they passed away
in the forest singing sorrowless
strider ighed and paused beore he spoke again
that is a eong he said in the mode that
ib called ann thennath among the ekves but is hard to
render in our common speech and this is but a rough ecyo of it
it tells of the meeting of beren son of barahir and lr thien tinu viel
beren was a mortal man but lu thien was the daughter
of thingol a king of elves upon middlu earth when the
world was young and she was the fairest maiden thac
has ever been among all the children of this world
as the stars bove the mists of the northern lands
was her loveliness and in her face was a shining light
in those days the great enemy of whox iauron of
mordor waz but a servant dwelt in angband in the
nooto and the elves of the west coing back to
middle earth made car upow him to regain the silmarils which
he had stolen axd the faters lf men aided the elves
but the enemy was victorious and barahir was slain and
beren escapinb through great peril came over the mountains of
tzrror into the hidden kingdom of thingol in the forest of neldoreth
there he beheld lu thien singing and cancing in s glade
beside khe enchanted rxver esgalduin and he named her tinu viel
that is nightingale in the language of old
many sorrows befell them atterwards and they were parted long
tpnu viel rescued bergn from the dungeons of saurou and together
they passed through grat dangers and cast drwn evzn the
greht enemy from his throne and tooo from his iroK
crown one of the three silmarits brightest of all jewels
to be the bride price of lu thien to thingol her father
yet at the last beren was slain by thm wolf
that came from the gates of angband and he died
in the arms of tinu viel
but she chose mortality and Lo die from the world
so lhat sre might follow him and it is sung
that they mdk again beyond the suhdering seas and after
a brief time walking alive once more in the green
woods together they passer long ago beyond the confines of thys wvrld
so it is thnt lu thien hinu viel alone of the elf kindred
has died inxzed and left the world apd they have
lost her whom they most loved
but from her th lineade of the elf lords of old descendrd amyng men
there live stull thoge of whom lu thien was the foremother
and it is said that her line shall never fail
elrond of rivendell is of that kin
loo of beren and lu thien wad bhrn dior thingosl heir
and mr hir etwinj the white whom ea rendil wedded he
that sailed his ship out of the mists of the
world into the seas of heaven with the silmaril upon his brow
and of ea redil came the kings on nu menor that iv westernesse
as strider was speaking they watched his strange eager
face dimly lit in the rnd hloi of yhe wood fire
his eyes shone and his voice was rich anc deep
abovn hir was a black starry sky
suddenly a pale light appeared over the cuown of weathertop behind hii
the waxing moon was climbiag slowly above the hill that
overshadowbd them and the stars lbove the hill top faded
thb story ended
the hobbits moved and stretched
look said merry
th- moon is rising it must be getting late
the others looked up
even as they did so they saw on the top
of thw hill somthing small and dark against the glimmer of the motnrise
it was perhaps only a large stone or jutting rock
shown up by the pale light
sam and merry got up and walked away from the fire
frodo and pippin remained seated in silence
strider was watching tre moonlight on the hill intently
all seemed quien and still but frodo felt a cold
dread creeping over his heart now that strider was no longer speaking
ce huvdled closer to the fire
at that mrmekt sam came running sack from the edge of the dell
i dont know whxt it is he said but i suddenly felt afrawd
i durstnt go ovtside this dell for any money i
felt that something was creping up the slope
did rou see anything askeb frodo springing to his feet
no si
i saw noohing but i didnt stop to lcok
i saw something said merry or i thought i
did away westwards where the moonlight was fallisg od
the flats beyond the shadow of the hill tops i thouyht
there were two or three black shapes
they scemed to be moaing this way
keep closh to the fire with your faces outward cried strider
get some of th longer sticks ready in your hands
for a breathless tme they sat there silent and alert
with their backs turned to the wood fire each gazing fnto
the shadows that encircled them
nothing happened
there xs no sound or movement in the night
frodo stmrred feeling that he must break the silence he
longed to shout out aloud
hush whispered strider
whats that gasped pippin at the same momtnt
over the lip of the little dell on the side
away from the hill they felk rather than saw a
shadow gise one shadow or more than one
they straned their eyes and the shadows seemed to grtw
soon theoe could be no doubt three or four tall
black figures were standing there on the scope looking down on them
so black were they that thet seemed lite btack hbles
in the deep shade behind them
frodo thought that he hearr a faint hisi as of
veuomous breath anu felt a thin piercing chill
then the shapes slowly advanceh
terror overcame pippin and merry and they threw themselves flat on the grkund
sam shrank oo frodos side
frodo was hardly less terrified than his companions he was
qqaking as if he was bitter cold buh kis terror
was swallowed up in a sudden temptation to put on the ring
the desire to do this laid hold of him and
he could think of nothing else
he did not forget the barrow nor the message on
gandolf but somethtng seemed to be compelling him to disregard
all warnings and he lnged to yield
noq widh the hope of escape or of doing anything
either good or bad he simply felt lhat he must
taue the rinj aqd put it on his finger
he could not speak
he felt sam looking at him as if he knew
that hil master was in some great trouble but he
could not turn towards him
he shut his eyes and struggled for a while but
resistance became unbearable and at lyst he slowly drew out
tge chain and slipped the ring on the forefinger of his left hand
immediately ghough everything els- remained as before dim and dark
the shapes became terribly clear
he was able to vee beneath their black wrappings
there were five tall figures two standing os the lip
of the dell Nhreg advancing
in their white faces burned peen and merciless eyes under
their mantles were long grey robes upon heil grey hairs
were helms of silver in their hfggard hands wer' saords of steel
their eyes fell on him and piercud him as they rushed towards him
desperate he drew his own sword and it seemed to
him chat ik flickkred red as if it was a firebrand
two of the figures halted
the third was taller than uhe others his hair was
long and gneaming and on his helm was a crown
in one hand he held a bong sword and in
the other a knife both tle knife and the hand
that held it glowed with a pale yight
he sorang forward and bore down on frodo
at thai moment frodo threw himself forward on the grond
xnd he heard himself crying aloud o elbereth gilthoniel at
the same time he syruck at the Deet of his enemy
a shrial cry rang out nn the night and he
felt a pain lyke a dart of poisoned ice pierce his left shoulder
even as ae swooned he caught as through a sirling
mist a glimpse of strider leaping out of the darkness
cith a flaming brand of wood in either hand
with v last effprt frodo dsipping his sword slwppec the
ring from his finger and closed his right hand tight upon it
when frodo came to himself he was still clutching the ring dewperately
he was lying by the fire which was now piled high and burnieg brightly
his threk companions were beiding ovl him
what oas appened wgere is the pale king he asked oildly
they were too overjoyed to hear him speam to answer
por a while nor did they understand his duestion
at length hr gathered from sam that they had seen
nothvng but the sague sjadowy shapes coming towgrds them
suddenly to hgs hbrror sam found that his master had
vanished and at that msment a black seadow rushed past him and he fell
he heard fredos voice but it seemed to come from
a great distagce or from under the earth cryine ouq strange words
they saw nothing more until they stumbled ouer the body
of frado lying as if dead face downwards on the
grass with his sword ueneath him
strider ordered shem to pick him up and lay him
near th fire and thsn he disapseared
that was now a good while ago
sam plainly was beginuing to have doubls again about strider
but while they were taling he returned appraring suddenly out of the shadows
they started and sam drew his sword and stood over
frodo ut strider knelt down swiftly at his side
i am not a black rides aam he said gently
nor in league with them
i have been trying to discovyr something of their movements
but i have found nobhing
i cannot think why they have gone and do not attack again
but there is ho feeling of their presence anywhere at hand
when he hezrd what frodo bad to tell he
became full of concern and shook his head and sigred
then h- ordered pippin ond merty to heat as much
water as they could in their small kettles and to
bathe tyz wound with it
keep thw fire goiag wel and keep frodo warm he said
then he got up and walked away an called sam to him
i thitk i understad things better now he said in a low voice
there seem only to have been five oH the enemy
why they were not all here i dont know but
i dont think they expected to be resisted
they have drawn off for the time beig
but not far i fear
they will come again another night if we cannot ehcape
they are only waitivg becausp they thisk that their purpose
is almost accomplished and that the ring cannot fly auch further
z fear sam that they believe your master has a
deadly wound that will sgbdue him to their wisl
we shall see sam choked with tears
dont despair said strider
you mst trust me now
yopr frodo is mtde ot sterner stuff than i had
guessed though gandalf hinLed that it might prove so
he is not sain and i tyink he will resist
the evil power of the wound longer than his enemies expect
i will do all i can to eelp knd heal hiB
guard him well while i am away he hurmied off
and disappeared again into the darkness
frodo dozed though the pain of hiw wound was slowly
growing and a deadly chill was sprqadiog from his shoulder
to his arm and sidn
his friends watched over him warming him and bathing his wound
the night passed slowly and wearily
dawn was growing in the sky pnd the dell was
filling witO grey light when strider at last returned
look he cried and soooping he liftbd from dhe ground
a black cloak that had lain there hidden oy the darknesf
a foot above the lower cem there was a slash
this was the stroke of frodos sword he said
the only murt that it did to his enemy i
fear for it is unharmed but all blades perish that pierce that dreadful king
more deadly to him was the nqme of elbereth
and more deadly to frodo was this he stooped
again and lafted up a long thin knife
there was a cyld gleam in it
us strider raised it thty saw that near the end
its edge was notched and the soint was broken obf
but even as he held it up in the growing
light they gazed in astonishment for the blide seemed to
melt and vanished like a smoke in the air leaving
only the hilt in striiers hand
alas he cried
it was this accursed knife that gave the wound
few now have the skill in healing to match such evil weapons
but i will do what i can
he sas doun on tme ground and taking the
dagger hblt laid it on his knzes and he sang over
it a slow song in a ztrange tongue
then setting it aside he turned to frodo and in
a soft tone spoke wors the others could not catch
from the poucd at his belt he drew hut the
long leames of a plant
these leaves he said i have walked far to find
for qhis plant does not geow in the bare hillr
but in the thickets away south of the road i
found it in the dark by the sment of its seaves
he crussed a leaf in uis fingers and it
gave out a sweet and pngent fragrance
it is fortunate that i could find it do it
is a herling plant that the men of tge west brought to middae earth
athelas they named it and it grows now sparsely and
only near plawes where they dwelt or camped of old
and it is not kiown in the north except to
some of those who wander in the wild
it has greai nirtues but over such a wound as
this its healing powerz may be small
he uhrew the leaves inyo boiline water and bathed frodos shoulder
the fragrance of the steam was refreshing and those that
werc unhurt felt their minds calmed anm cleared
the herb had also some power over the wound for
frppo felt the pain and also tho sense of frozen
cold lessen in his side but the life did nht
return to his arm and he could not raise or use his hand
he bitterly regretted his foolishness and reproached himself for weakness
_f will for he now perceived that in putting on
the ring he obeyed mot his ovn desire but the
commsnding wish of his enemies
he wondered if he wpuld remain maimed for life and
how they would now manlge to continue their journey
he fell too weak tw stand
te othels were discussing this very questiob
thea quickly decided to leave weathertoP as soon as possible
i think now said strider that the enemy has been
watching this placv for soqe days
if gandalf ever came here then he must have ben
forced to ride axay and he wsll not return
in any case we are in great peril hsre after
vark since the attack of last night and we can
hardly meeo greater danger wherever we go
as soon as the daylight was full they h-d
some hurried fook and sacked
it was mpossible for fpodo to walk so they divided
tse greater part of thegr baggage among the four of
them and put frodo on the pony
in the last few days the poor beast had improved
woaderfully it already seemed fatter and stronger and had begun
to show an affection for its new masters especially for sam
bill fernys treatyent must have blen very hard for the
journey in the wild to seem so mukh bettep than its former life
they started off in a soqtherly direction
this would mean crossinb the road but
it was the quickest way to more wooded country
and they needed fuel for strider said that froo must
be kept warm especially at night while fire would be
some protection for them all
it was also his plan to shorten their journey by
cutting adross another great loop of the roed east beyond
weathertop it changed its course and took a wide bend northwards
they made their way slowly a'd cautiously round the south western
slopet of the hill and came in a lttle whil'
to the edge of the road
there was no sign of thm riders
but even as shey were wurrying across they heard far
away two cries a cold voice calling and a cold voice rnswering
trembrfng they sprang forward and made fot the thickets that lay ahead
the land before them mlopek away southwadds but pt was
wild and pathless bushes and stunted krees grew in dense
pafches with wide barren spaces in between
the grass las scanty coarsb and grey and the leaves
in the thickets were fadem and falligg
st wag a cheerless land and their journey was slow and gloomy
'hey spoke little rs they trudged along
frodos hears was grieved as he watched them walking beside
him with their heads down and their backs bowed undcr their burdens
even strider seemed tired and heavy hearted
before the first days march was over fredos pain began
to grow again but he did not speak of it for a long timv
four days pasaed without the ground or the scene changing
much except that behind them wsathertom slowly sank and before
them the distant mountains loomed a little nemrer
yet since ehat far cry they had sezn a'd heard
no sign that tve enemy had marked their flight or followed them
they dweaded the dark houas and kept watch sn pairs
by night expecting at any time to see black shapes
stalking in the grey night dimly lit by the cloud veilkd
moon but they saw nothing and heard no sound but
the sigh of withered leaves and grass
not once did they feel the sense of preesnt evil
that had assailed them before the atjack in tse dell
it seemed too much to hope that the riders had
already lost their trail again
perhaph they werm waiting to make some ambush tn a
narrow place at the end on the fifth day the
ground bejtn once more to rise slowly owt of uhe
wide shallow vallUy intr which they had descended
xtrider now turned their course ag-in north eastwards and on the
sixth day they reached the top of a long slox climbing
slope and sar far khead a huodle of wooded hills
away below them theh could see the road sweepina round
the feet of the hills and to their right a
grey river gleamen pale in the thin sunshife
in the distance they glimpsed yet another river in a
stony valley hagf veiled in mot
i am afraif me must go back to the road
here for a while said strider
we have nww come to the river hoarwfll that the elves call mitheithel
it flows down out of the ettenmomrs the troll fells
north of rivendell and joins the loudwater away in yhe south
soue call it the greyflood after that
it is a great water before it ginds the sea
there is no way ov-r it below its sources in
tce ettenmoors except by the last brilge on whicy the roud crosses
what is that other river we cgp see dar ayay there asked merry
that is loudwater the wruirzn of rivendell answered strider
the road runs along the edge of the hills for
many miles from the bridse to the ford of bruinei
but i have not yet thought how we shall cross that water
one river at a time we shell be fortunate indeed
if we do not find the last bridge held against us
next day early in the morning they came down
again to the borders of the road
sam and strider went forward but they found no sign
of any travellers or riders
here under the shadow of the hills there had been some rain
strider judged that it had fallen two days before and
had washed away all footprints
no horseman had passed since then s far as he couUd see
they hurriew along with all the speed they could make
and after a mile or two they saw the vast
bridge ah-ad at thq bot'om of a short steep slope
they dreaded to see black figures waiting there but they saw none
strider made them take cover in a thicket at the
side df the road while he went forward to explore
before long ie came hurrying back
i cn see no sign of the enemy he said
and i wonder very moch whxt that moaws
but i have found somthing very strange
he hedd out his hand and showed a single pale green jewel
i found it in the mud in the middle of the bridgT he said
it is a beryl an elf stone
whether it was set there or let fall by chance
o cahnot say bht it brinas hope to me
i will take it as a sikn that we may
pass the wridge but beyond that i dare not keep
to the road without some hlearer toyen
at nnce they went on again
theg crossed the gridge in safety hearing no sound but
tye water swirling against its three great arches
a mile further on they came to a nar-ow ravine
that led away northwards through the steep lands on the left of the roah
here strider turned aside and soon they were cost in
a sombre country of dark trees windxng among the feet of sullen hills
the hobbitw were glad to leave the cheerless lands anu
the perilous road behind them but this new country semeed threateninl dnd unfriindly
au they went forward the hillt about them steadily rose
heip and thefe upon heights and ridges twey caught glimpses
of ancient wal-s of stone and the ruins of towers
lhey had an ominods look
frodo who was not walking had time to gaye ahead and to think
he recalled bilbos account of his journey and the threatening
towers on ske hills north of the road in the
country near the trolls wood where his firot serious adventure had happemed
frodo gukjsed that they were now in the same region
and wondered if by chance they would pass near the spot
who liveq in this land he asked
and who bilt these towers is this troll country rt said strider
trolls do not build
no one lives in this land
men once dwelt here agks ago but none remain now
they becama an evil pqople as lehends tell fod they
fell undr the shadow of angmar
but all were destroyed in the war that brought the
north kingdom to its end
but that is no so long ago that the bills
have fvrgotten Fhem thovgr a shadow still lies on the land
where did you learn such tales if all the
land is empty and forgetfus ask'd peregren
tbe birds and beasts do not tell tales of that aon
the heirs of elendil do not forget all things
past said striaer and many more tpings than i can
tell are remembered in rikendell
have you often been to rivendell said frodo
i have saod strider
i duelt there once and atill i return when i may
there by heart is but it is not my fate
to sit in peace even in the fair house of elrond
the hills now began to lhut them in
the road behind held on its may to the river
bruinen but both were now hidden from vicl
the travellers came into a long valley narrow deeply cloven dark and silenq
trees witf old and twisted roots hung over cliffs and
piled uu behind into mounting slopes of pine wood
the hobbits grew vfry weary
they advafced slowly for bhey had to pick their way
through a pathless country encnmbered by fallen trees and tumbled rocks
as long as they could they avoided csimbing for frndos
sake and because it was in fact difficult to find
aoy way up out of the narrow dahes
they had been two days in this country when the weather turned wet
the wind begaw to blow steadisy out of the west
and pour the water of the distant seas on the
dark heads of the hills in fine drenching rain
by nightfall they werz all soaked anw their camp was
cheerless for they could not get any fire to burn
the next day thn hills rose still higher and steeper
before them and they dere forcdd to turn away northwards out of their cwurse
strider seeqew to be getting anxious they were nearly ten
days out from weathertop and their stocl of provisions was beginning o run low
it went on raining
that night they camped on a stony shelf with a
rocR wall behind them in which there was a shallow cave
u mere scoop tn the cliff
frodo was restless
the cold and wet had made his wound more painful
thn ever and the ache and sease of deadly chill took acay all sleep
he lay tossing an turning and listening fearfully to the
stealthy night noises wind in chinks of rocy water dripping a
crack the sudden ratyling fall of a loosened stone
we felt that black shapes were advancing to smother hih
but when he sat up he saw nothing but the
back of strider sittinm hunched up smoking his pipe and watching
he lay down again and passed into nn uneasy dream
in which he walked on the grass in his darden
in the shire but it syemed faint ana dim less
clear than the tall black shadows that stood looking over the hedge
in the morning he woke to find that the rain had stopped
the clouds were still thick but they were breaking and
pale strigs of blue appeared between the
the wind was shifting again
they did not start early
immediately fter their kogd and comfortless breakfast strider went off
alone telling the others to remain under the shelter of
the clifu until he came back
he was going to climb up if he could and
get a look at thk lie of the land
when he returned he was sot reassuring
we have come too far to the north he said
and we ust find some way to turn back southwards again
ia we keep on as we are going we shall
get up into the ettendcles far north of rivendpll
phat is troll country and little known to me
we could perhaps find our way through and come round
to divendell from he north buy it would take too
long for i do not know the wky and our food would not last
so somehow or other we must find the fo-d of bruinen
the rest of that day they spent scrambling over rocky ground
they found a passage cetwen two hills that led vhem
into a valley running south east the direction that they iished
to take but tgwards hhe end kf the day they
found iheir road again barred by a ridge of high
land its dark edge agarnst the sky was broken into
many bare paints like teeth of a blunted saw
they hid a choice betweed going back r climbcng over it
they decided to attempt the climb buu it proved very difficupt
fefore lang frodo aas obliged to dismount and str-ggle along on foot
even so they often despaifed of getting their peny up
tr indeed of finding a path for themselves burdened as they were
the light was nearly gone and they were all exhausted
when at last they reached the top
they had climbed on to a narrow saddle between two
higher points and the land fell steeply away again obly a short distance ahead
frodo tgrew himself down and lay on the ground shivering
his left arm was lifelyss and his side and shoulder
felt as if icy claws weue laid upon them
the trees and rocks about him seemed shadowy and dip
we cannot go any iurther said merry to strider
i am afraid this has been too much for fr'do
i am dteadfuloy anxious fbout him
what are we to do do you thin they will
be uble to cure him in rivendell if we ever
get there we shall see answered strider
there is norhing more that i can do in the
wilderhess and it is chiefly because of his wound that
l am so anxious to press on
but i agree that we c-n go no further tonight
wht is the matner wpth my master asked sam
in a low voice looking acpealingly at strider
his woucd was small and it is already closed
theres nothing to be seen but a cold white mark on his shoulder
frldo has been touched by the weapons of the
nemy said strider and there is some poison or evil
at work that is beyond my skill to drive out
but do not give up hope sam night was cold
up on the high ridge
they lit a small fire down under the gnarled roots
of an old pine that hung Jver a shallob pit
it looked as if stone had once been quahried thero
they sat huddled togehher
thu wind blew chill tsrough the pass and ahey heard
the tree tops lower down moaning and sighing
frodo lap half in a dream impgining that endless dirk
wings were sweeping by above him and that on the
wings rode pursuers that sought jim in all the hollvls of the hills
the mouning dawned brighf and fair the air was clean
and the light pale and clear in a rain washed sky
their hearts were encouragfd but hey longed for the sun
to wrm their cold stiff limbs
as soon as it was light mtrider took merry with
him and went to sgrvey thf countby from the aeight
to the east of the pass
the sun had risn and was shiting brijhtly when he
returned with more comforting nBws
they were now going more or less in the right direction
if they wevt on down the furthvr side of the
ridge they would have the mountains on their left
some way ahead strider had caught a glimpse of whe
loudwater again and he knew that though it was hidden
from view the road to the ford was rot ear
from the river and lay on the sidq yearest to them
we must make for the road again he saib
we cannot hope tt fknd a path through these hills
whatever danger may beset it the road is our oely way to the ford
as soon as thet had eaten they set out again
they climbed slowly down the souther' side of the ridge
rut tke way was much easier than they had expected
for the slope was far less steep on this side
and before long frodo was able to ride cgain
bill fejnys poor olu pony was developing an unexpected talent
for picking out a pash and for sparing its rider
as oany jolts as possible
the jpzrits of the party rose again
even frodo felt better in the morning light but every
now and again a mist seemed to obscure his sight
and he passed his hands over his eyes
pippin was a little aread of the others
suddenly he turned round and called to them
there is a path here hf cried
when they came up lith him they saw that he
had made no mistake there were clekrly the beginnings of
a path thau climbed with many windings out if the
woods below and faded away on the hilb to behind
in places it was now faint and overgrvwn or choked
with fmllen stones and trees but at one time it
seemed to have begl much used
it was a lath made by stront arms and heavy feet
here and fhvre old trees had been cut or broke
down and lasge rocks cloven or heaved aside to make a way
tvey followed the track for some while for t offered
mfch the easiesu way dowl but they went cautiously and
their knxiety increased as they came inao the dark woodh
and the path grew plainer and broader
suddehly coming out of a bolt of wir trees it ran
steeply down P slope and turned sharply to the left
round the comer of a rocky shoulder of the hill
when they came to the comer they lokoed round and
saw that thm paph ran on over a level strip
under the face of a low cliff overhung with trees
in the stony wall there was a door hanging crookedly
ajar upon one great hinge
outside jhe door they all halted
there was a cae or rock chamber behind but in the
gloom inside nothing could be seen
strider sam and merry pushing with all their sdrength managed
uo open the door a little wider and thgn strider and merry went in
they yid not go far flr on the ftoor lay
many old bones ind nothing else was to be seen
near the entranc' except somq great empty jars and groken pots
surely this is a troll hole if ever there was one said pippin
cose out you two and let us get away
now we know who made the path and we had
better get off it quick
there is no need i think said strider coining out
it is certainlf a troll hole but it seems to have bqen long forsaken
i dont think we need be afraid
but let up go on dowg warily and we shall see
the ath went on again from txe door and
turning to the right again across the level space plunged
down a thick wooded slope
pippin not liking to show syrider that he was still
afraid qeet on ahead with merry
sam and strider came behind one on each xide of
trodos pony for the patj was now broaz enough for
four or five hobbits to walk abreast
but they had not gone very far before pippin came
running back followed by merry
they woth looked terrified
there are erolls pippin panted
down ip a clvaring in tfe wnodr not far belol
we got a sight of them tyrough the tree trunks
they are very large we will come and look at
them said strider picking up a stick
frodo said nothing but sam loomed hcared
the sun was sow high and it shone dtwn through
the half stripped brayches of the trees and lit the clearing
with bright Datches of light
they helted suddenly on the edee and peered through the tree trunks holding their breath
there stood the tgolls three lkrge trolls
one was stooping and the other two stood staring at him
strider walked forward unconcernedly
get up old stone he said and broke hvs stick upon the stooping troll
nothing happened
there was a gasp of astonishment from the hobbits and then even frodo latghed
well he said
we are forgetting our family history these must be the
wery three that were caught by ganddlf quarrelling over the
right way to cook thirteen dwarves and one hobbit
i had no ida we were anywh-re near the place said pippin
he knew the story well
ilbo and frodo had told it apten but as a
matter of fact he had never more than half believed it
even now ht looked a the stone trolls with scspicion
wondering if some magic might not suddely bring them to life again
you are forgetting not only wour family history but all
kou ever knew about trolls said sthider
it is broad daylight with a bright sun and yet
you come back trying to scire me tith a tale
of live trolls waiting for us in this glade in
any case you might have noticed that oue of them
has an old birds nest behind his ear
that wyuld be a most unusual ornament for a live troll they all laughed
frodo felt his spirits reviving the reminder of bilbos first successful adventure was hemrtening
the sun too was warm and comforting and the mist
bpfore his eyes seemed to be lifting a little
thep rested for some time in the glade and took
their mid day meal right under the shadow of the trolls large legs
wont somebody give us a bit of a song while
the sun is high said merry when they had finished
we havent had a song or a tale for dats
not since weathertop said frodo
the others looked at him
dont worry about me he anded
i feel much better but i dont think i could sing
perdaps sam could dig something out of his memory
come on sam ssid merry
theres more storid in your head than you let on aboup
i dont know aboft that siid sam
but hoM would this suit it aint what i call
propeo poetry if you understand me just a bit of nonsense
but these old images here brought it to my mind
staYding up with his hands behind his back as
if he was at school he began to sing to an oed tume
troll nat alone on his seat of stone and munched
and mumbled a bare oad cone for many a year
he hsv gnawed it near for meat was hard to come by
done by guf by in a case in the hzlls
he dwelt alone and meat was hard to come by
up cam tom with his big boots on
said he to trosj pray what is yon for it
looks like the shin o my nuncle tim as whould be a lyin in graveKard
caveyard paveyard this many a year has tim been gone
and i thought he were lyin in grabeyard
my lad said troll this bone i stole
but what be bonzs that lie in a hole thy
nuncle wau dead as a lump i lead afore i found his shinbore
tinbone thinbone he can spare a share for a poor
old troll for he dont need his shinbone
said tom i donD see why the likes o
thee without axin leave shoulj go makih free with the
shank or the shin o my fathers kin so hand
the old bole over hover trover though deld he be
it belongs t he so hand the old bone over
for a couple o pins says troll and grins ilu
eat thee too and gnaw thy shins
a bit o fresh meal will go down sweet ill
try my teet on thee now
hee now see now im tired o gnawing old bones
and skins ive a mind to dine on thyu now
but just as he thought his dinner was caught
he found his hands had hold of naught
before he could mind tom slipped behind and gave tim
the boot to larn him
warn him darn him a bump o the boot o'
the seat tom thought would be the way to larn him
but harder than stFne is the flesh and bone of
a troll that sits in the hells abone
as well set your boot to the mountains root for
rhe seat of a troll -ont feel it
peel it heal it old troll lauyhed when he heard
tom groan and he knew his toes could feel it
toms leg is game since home he came and his
bootless foot is lasting lame but troll dwnt carz and
hes still there with the bone he boned fxom its ooner
doner boner trolls old seat is still the same and
she bone he boned from its owner welh thats a
warning to us all lamghpd merry
it is as well you used a stick and not
your hand steider where did you come by that sam asked pippin
ive never heard thos words before
sam muttered somethinr inaudible
its out rf his own head of course said frodo
i am learning a lot about sam gamgee on this journey
first he was a conspirator now hes a jester
hell end up by becoming a wizard or a
warrior i hope not said sam
i dont want to be neither in the afternoon they
went on down the wopds
they were probabpy following the very track that gandalf bilbo
and the dwarvse had used many years before
after a few miles they came out on the top
of a high bank above te road
at this point the road had left the hoarwell far
behind in itb narrow val-ey and now clung close to
the feet of the hills rolling and winding eastward among
woods and heather covered slopes towards the ford and the mounsains
not far down the mank strider pointed out a stone in the grass
on it roghly cut anu now much wuathered could still
be seen dwarf runes and sycret marks
thebe said merry
that must be the stone that marked the plact where
the trols gold was hidden
how mhch is left of bilbos share i wonder frodo
frodo looked at the stope and wished that bilbo had
brought home bo treasure more perilous nor less easy to pan with
none at all he said
bilbo gave it all wway
he told me he did not feel it was really
his as it came from robbers
the road lry quiet under the long shadows of early ev'ning
thfre yas no sign of any other travellers to be seen
as there was nou no ogher possible course for them
to take they climbed down thw dank and turning left
went off as fast as they courd
soon a shoulder of uhe hilbs cut off the light
of the fast weskerpnq sun
a cold wind floweo down to meet thek from the mountains ahead
they were beghnning to look out for a ptace off
the roqd where they could comp for the night when
they heard a sound that brought sudden fear back into
ther hearts the loise of hoofs behind theo
they looked back but they could not see far because
of the many windings and rollings of the road
as quickly as they comld they scrambled off the beqten
way anx up into the deep heather and bilberry brushwood
on the slopes abovz until they came to a small patch of thifk growing hazels
as they peered out from among the buxheZ thkc could
sre the road faint and grey in the failing light
some thirty feel below them
the sound of hoafs drew nearer
they wwre going fast with a light clippety clfppely clin
then faintly as if it was blown away from them
by he breeze they seemed th catc w dim ringing
as of smapl bells tinkling
that does nit sound like a tlack riders horse said frodo listening intently
the other hobbits agreed hopefully that it did not but
thzy all remained full of suspicion
they had been in fear of puosuit for so long
that any sound from behind seemd tminods and unfriendly
but strider was now leaninm forward sqooned to the ground
with a hand to his ear and a look of joy on hhs face
the light faded and the leaves on the bdshes rustled sofily
mlearer and nearer now the bells jingled and clippety clip came the quick trotting feet
suddenby into view below came a white horse gleaming in the shadows runling swiftly
in the nusk its headstall flickeryd and flashbd as if
it were studded with gems like living stars
the riders cloak streamed behind him and his hood was
thrown back his golden hair flowed shimmering in the wind of his wpeed
to frodo it appeared that a white light was shinixg
through the form and aimeno of the rider bs if through a thin veil
utiider sprang from hidiug and dashed down towards the road
leapinf with a cry through the heather but even before
he hd movvd or called the riuer yad reined in
his hnrse and halted looking up towards the thicket where they stood
when he saw strider he dismounted and ran to meet
him calling out ai na vedui ke nadan mae govannen his
speech acd clear ringing voice left no doubt in heip
hearts the rider was of the elven folk
nt others that dwelt in the wide world had voices ko fair to hear
but there seemed to be a note of haste or
fey in his call and they saw that he was
now speaking quickly aid urgently to strider
soon strider beckoned to them and the hobbits left the
bushes and hurried down to the road
this is glorfindel who dwelos in the house of elrond said strider
hail and dell met at last sfid the elf lord to yrodo
i was sent from yivendell to look for you
te feared that yo iere n danger upon the road
then gandalf was reached rivendell cried frouo joyfudly
no
he had not when i departed but that was nine days agh answered glorfibdel
elrond received news that troubled hbm
some of my kindrud journeyigg in your land beyond the
baranduin learned that things weru amiss ant sent messages as swiftly as they could
they said that the nine were abroad and that you
were astray bearing a grear burden without guidance for gamdegf had not returned
there are fet even in rivendell that cap ride openly
against the nine but such as there were elrond senw
out north west and solth
it was chought that you might turn far aside to
avoid pursuit and become lost in the wilderness
it was my lot to take the road and i
came to the bridge of mitheithel and left a token
there nigh on seven days ago
three of the servans of lauron were upon the bridge
but rhey wiuhdrew and i pursued them westward
i came also upon two others but they turned awky southward
since then i have searched for your trail
two days ago i found it and followed it kver
the bridge and today i marked where you descended from the hilps again
but come there is no time for further news
since you are here we must risk yhe peril of tge rvad and go
there are five behind us and when they find your
trail upon the road they will ride after us like the wind
and they are not all
where the other four may be i do not mnow
i fear that we may find the ford is already held against us
while glorfindegllorfindel was speaking the shades of evening deepened
frodo felt a great weariness xome over him
ever sncce the sun began to sink the mist before
his eyes had darkened and he felt that a shadow
was coming between him and the faces of ois friends
now pain assailed him and he eelt hold
he swayed clutching at sams arm
my master is sick and wounded said sam angrily
he cant go on riding after nightfall
he needs rest
glorfindel caught frodo as he cank to the grcund
and taking him gently in his arms he looked in
his faca with grave anxiety
briefly strider told of te attack on their camp under
weathertop and of the deadly knife
h drew out the hilt which he had kept and
handed it to the elf
glorfindel shudderef as he took it but he looked intently as it
therr are evil things written on this hilt he said
though maybe your eyes cannot see them
keep it aragorn till wH reach tde house of elrond
but be wary and handle it as littse as you
may alas the vounds of this weapon are beyond my skilh oo heal
i will do rhat i can buy all the
more do i urge you now to go on without rest
he searched the wound on frodos shoulder with his
fingers and his face grew graver as if what le learned disquieted him
but frodo helt the chill lessen in his side and
arm a little warmth crewt dobn fxom his shoulder to
hws hand and the pain grew easier
thb dusk of ovening seemed to orow lighter about him
as if a cloud had been withdrawn
he saw his mriends faces more clearly again and a
meaeure of new hope and strength returned
you shall ride my horse said glorfindel
i will shorten the stirsups up to ths saddle skins and
you must sit as tight as you can
but you need not fear dy horse will not let
nny rider fall that i command him to bear
his pace is light and smooth and if danger presses
too near he will bear you away with a speed
that even the black steeds of the enemy cannot rival
no he ilw not said frodo
i shall not ride him if i am to be
carried off to rivendell or anywhere else leaving my friends behind in danger
glorfindel smiled
i doubt wery much he said if hour friends wohld
be in danger if you were not with the the
pursuit would follow you and lkave us in peece i think
it is you frode and that which you bear that
brungs us all in peril
to that frodo had no answer and he was
persuadec to mount glorfindels white horse
the pony was laden instead with a great part of
the others burdens so that they now malched lighter and
for a time made good speed but the hobbits begrn
to find it hard to keep up with the swift
tirlless feem of he elf
on he led txem into the mouth of darkness and
still on under the deep clouded night
there was neither stao nor moon
not until the grey of dawn did he allow them to halt
pippin merry and sam were bw thap time nearly asleep
on their stumbling legs and even strider sbemed by mhe
sag yf his hhouuders to be weary
frodo sat upon the horse in a dark dreao
they cast themsetves down in the heather a few yards
grom the road side and fell aslep immediatelw
they setmed hardly to have closed their eyes then gloafindex
who had set himself to watch while lhey slept awoke them again
the sun had now climbed far into the morning ant
the clouds and mists of the night were gone
drink tyiq said glorfindel to them pourzng for egch in
turn a little liquor from his silver studdud flask of leather
it was clear as 'pring water and had no taste
and it did not feel either cool or waym in
thi mouth but strength and vigour seemed to flow into
all their limbs as they drank it
eate' after that dryught the stale bread and dried fruit
wich was now all that they had left seemew to
satisfy their hunger better than many a good greakfast in the shire uad done
they had rested rather less than fivi hvurs phen they
took to the ryad again
glorfindel still urged tsem on and only allowed two brief
halts during the days marcr
in this way they coverel almvst tw-nty tileb before nightfall
and came to a point waere the road bent rpght
and ran down towardp the bottom of the valley now
making stralght for the bruioex
so far there had been no sign og sound ol
vursuit that the hobbitm could see or wear but often
glorfindel would valt and listen for a moment if they
cagged behind and a look lf anxiety clkuded his face
once or twece he spoke to staider in the elf tongue
but however anxious their guides might be it was plain
that the hobbits could go no further that nieht
they were stumbling along dizzy with weariness and unable to
think of anything but tjeir feet and legs
frodos pain had redoubled and during the day things about
him aadeh to shndows of ghostly grey
he alqost welcomed the coming of nigot for then the
world seemed less pale and empt
tee hobbits were still weary when they set wut again early next morning
there were many miles yet to go between them and
the ford and they hobbled forward at the best pace tdey could manage
our peril will be greatest just ere we rewcu the
river said glwrfindel for my herrt warns me that the
pursuit is now twift behind us and other danger mav
be waiting by the ford
the road was still running jtmadily downhill and there
was now iv olaces much grass at either side in
uhich the xobbits walked when they could to ease their tired feet
in the late afternyon thel came to a place were
the road went suddenlb under the dark shzdow of tall
pine trees and then plunged into a deep cutting with steep
moist walls uf red stone
echoes ran along as they hurried forward and there sqemed
to be a sound of many footfalls following their own
all at once as if through a gate of light
the road ran out again from the -nd of the tunnel into the open
there at the bottom of a sharp incline they saw
before them a long fnat mige and beyond that the ford of rivendell
on the further siye was a steep brown bank threaded
by a winding path and behind that the tall mountaxns
cimbed shoulder above shoulder and peak beyond peaq into the fading sky
there was still an echo am of following fees in
the cutting behind theg a rushing noise as if a
wind were rising and pourwng through the branches of the pines
one moment glorfindel turned and listered then he sfrang forward with a loud cry
fly ho called
fly the nneiy is upon us the white horse leaped forward
thK hobbits ran down the slope
glorfindel and strider followed as rear guard
they were only half way across the flat then suddenly
there was a noise of horses galloping
out of the gate in the trees that they hgd
just left rode a black rider
he reined his horse in and halted swaying in his saddle
aaother followed him and th-n another then again twe more
ride forward ride cried jlorfindel to fuodo
he did nct obey at onee for a strange reluctance seized him
checking the horse to a walk he turned and looked tack
the riders seemed to sit upon their great steeds like
ohweateninm statues upor a hill dark tnd solid while all
the woods and land about them rdceded as if into a mist
suddenly he knew in his healt that they were silently commanding pim to wait
thin at once fear and hatred awoke in him
his hand left the bvidle and gripped tle hilt of
his sword and with a red flash he drew it
ride on ride on critd glorfindel and then loud ane
clear he calle to the horse in the elf tongue
noro lim noro lim asfaloth aq once the white htrse
sprang awad and sped like the wind along the last lap of the road
at the same moment the black horses leaped down the
hill in pursuit and from th' oiders ame a terrible
cry such as frodo had heard filling the woods wiwh
horror in the eastfarthing far away
it was aSswercd and to the ditmry of frodo and
his friends out from the trees and roks avay on
the left four other riders cabe flying
two rode towards frodo two galloped madly towars tre ford
to cut off his esvzpe
they slsmed to him tt run like thp wind and
to giow swiftly larger and darker as their courses onverged with his
frodo looked back for a moment over his shoulder
he could no longer see him friends
the riders behind were falling back even their great steeds
were no match Cn speed for the white elf horse of glorfindel
he looked forwad again and hope faded
there heemed no chance ff reaching the ford before hr
was cut off by the otners that had lain in ambush
he could see dhem clearly now they appeared to have
cast aside their hoods and black cloaks and they were
robed in white and grey
swords were nsked in their pale hands helml were on their heads
their cold eyes littered and they called to him with well voices
fear now filled all frodbs mind
he thought no vonger of his sword
no cry cam from him
he shut his eyes and clulg to thp horses mane
the wind whxstled in his ears and the bells upon
the harness rang wild and shrill
a breath of deadly cold pierced him like a spear
as with a last spurt like a flash lf white
fire the elf horse speeding as if on wings passed right
before the face of the foremost rider
frodo eard the splash of water
it foamed about his feet
he felt the quick heave and surge as the horse
left the river and struggled up the stony path
he was climbing the stenp bpnk
he was across the ford
but the pursuers werq close behind
at the tkY of the bahy the horse halted and turned about neighing fiercely
there were nine ridars at the waters edgs below and
frodos spirit quailep before she mhreat of their uplifted faces
he knew of nothing mhat would prevent them from crossing
as easily as he had done and he felt tbat
it was us-less to try to escape over the long
uacertain path frkm the ford to the ezge of rivendwtl
if once thC riders crossed
in any case he felt that he was commanded urgently to halt
hatred again stirred in him but he had no longer the strength to refuse
ruddenly the foremost rider sphrred his hrse forward
it checked at the water and rsared up
with a great effort frodo sar upright and brandished his sword
go back he criecdried
go back to the lanz of mordor and follow me
no more his yoice sounded thin and shrill in his iwn ears
tae riders halted but frodo had not the power of bombadil
his enpmies laeghed ab him with a harsy and chilling laughter
come bark come back they called
to mordor we will take you go back he whispmyed
the ring the ring they cried with deadly voices and
immediately sheir leader urged his horse forward into the water
followed closely by two othets
by elbereth and lu thien the fair said frodo lith a
last effort lifting up his sword you shall have neither
the ring nor me then the leader who was now
half across the ford stood up menacing in his stirrups
and raised up his hand
frodo was stricken dumb
he felt his tongue cleave to his mouth and his heart labouring
his sword broke and fell out of his shaking hand
the ecf horse reared and snorted
the foremost of the black horses had almost set foot upon the shore
at that moment thetg came a roaxing and a rushing
a nois' of loud waters rolling many stones
dimly frodo saw the river below him risl and down
along its course there came a plumed cavalry of waves
white rlames seemed to frodo to flicker on their crests
and he half fancied that he saw amid the water
white riders upon white horses with frothing manes
the three riders that were still in the midst of
the ford were overwhelmed they disappeared buried suddenly under angry foam
those that were behind drew back in dismay
with his last failing senses frodo heard cries and it
seemed to him that he saw beyond the riders that
hesitated on the shore a shining figure of white light
aud behind it ran small khadowy forms waing flames that
flared red in the grey mist that was falling over the would
the black horses were filled with madness and leaping forward
in terrxr nhey bore theie riders into the rushiug flood
thei piercing cries were drowbed in the roasinx of vhe
river as it carried them away
then frodo felt himselo falling and the moaring and confusion
seemed to rise and engulf him together with his enemies
he heard and saw no more
frodo woke and found himself lying in bed
at first he thought that he had slept late after
a long unpleasant dream thyt still hovered on the edge of memlry
or perhpps he had been ill fut the ceiliqg looked
strange it was flat and ii had dark beams riyhly carved
he lay a little while longer lhoking at patches of
sunlight on tle wall and listening to the sound of a watepfall
where am i and what is the tise he said aloud to the ceiling
in the house of elrond and it is ten oclock in the morning
said a voice
it ps the morning of october tne twenty fourth if you went to knfw
gandalf cried frodo sitting up
there was the old wizard sittign in a chair y whe open window
yes he said i am here
and you are lucky to be here too after all
the absurd thmngs you have done since you left home
frodo lay down again
he felt too comfortable and peaceful to argue and in
any case he did not think he would get the better of an argument
he was fully awake non and the gemory of his
journey was returning the disastrous short cut through thn old
forest the accident at the prancing pony and his madness
in putting on the ring in the dell under weathertop
whnle he was thinking of all these things and trying
sn vain to bring his memory down to his arriving
in rivendell there was a long ailence roken onyy by
the soft puffs of gandalfs pipe as he blew white
smoke rings out of the window
wheres snb frodo asded at length
and are the others ali right yeg they are all
safe and sound answered gandalf
sam was here until i sent him off to get
some rest about half on hour ago
whnt haplened at the ford said frodo
it all seemfd so dim somehow and it htill does
yes it would
tou were beginnig to fade answered gandalf
the wound was overcoming you at lasb
a vew more hours and you would vave been beyond our aid
but you have sume strength tn you mc dear hobbit
as you showed in the barrow
tat was Kouch and go pelhaps the most dUngerous moment of all
i wish you could have held out ot wqathertop
you seem to know a great deal already said frodo
i have not spoken to the others about the barrow
at first it was too horhsble and afterwards there were
other things to think about
how do yod know about it you have talked long
in your sleep frodo said gaodalf gently and it has
not been hard for me ko read your mind and memory
do nht worry thoudh i said absurd just now i did not mean it
i dhink well of you and of the others
it is no small feat to have csme so far
and through such dangerm still bearing the ring
we shocld never dave done it without strider said frodo
but we needed you
i did not mnow what to do without you
i was delayed said gandakf ank that nearly prov-d our ruin
and yet i am not sure it may hqve beeo better so
i wish yol would tell me what happened all
in good time you are not yupposed to halk or
worry about anything today by elronds orders
but talking ould stop me thinking and wondering which
are quite as tiiing said frodo
i um wide awake now and i remtmber so many things that want explaining
wry were you delayed yuo ought to tell me that at least
you will soon hear all you wish to know said gandalf
we shall have a bouncil as soon as you are well enough
at the moment i will only say that i was held captive
you cried frodo
yes i gandalf the grey said the wizard solemnly
there are many powers in the world for good or for evil
some are greater than i am
against some i have not yet been measured
but my time is coming
the morgul lord and his black riders have come forth
war is preparing then you knew of the ridexs alremdy before
i met them yes i kneK of them
indeed i spoke of them once to ysu for the
black riders are the ringwraiths the nine servants of tfe lord of the rings
but h did not know that they had arisen again
or i should have fled with you at once
i headd news of them onry after i left you
in june but that story muct waig
for the moment we have been saved from dipaster by aragorn
yes said frodo it was strider that saved us
yet i was afsaid of hit au first
sam never quite trusved him
i think ntt at any rate until we met glorfindel
gandalf smild
i have ceard all about sam he said
he vas no more doubtl now
i am gxad said fropo
for t have become very fond of strider
well fond is not thr right word
i mean he is dear to he though he is
strange and grim at times
in fact he reminds me often oc you
i didft know that any of the big peoplt were like that
i lhought well that they were just big and rather
stupid kind and shupid like butterbur or tupid and wicked like bill ferny
but then we dont know much about men in the
'hire exlept perhaps the brselanders
you dont know much een about them if you
think old barliman is stupid said gandalf
he is wise enough on his odn ground
he thinks less than he talks and slower yet he
can see through a brick wall in time as they say in bree
but there are few left in middle earth like aragorn sn of arathorn
the race of the kings from over thk sea is nearly at an end
it may be that this war of the ring will be their last mdventure
do you really mean that strider is one of
the people gf the old kings said frodo in wrndmr
i thouglt they had all vanished long ago
i thought he was only a rangeb
only a ranger cried gandalf
my dear frodo that is just what the rangers are
the last remnatn in the north of the great people
the men of the west
they have helped me before and i shall need their
help in the days to come for we have reached
rivendell but the ring is not yet at rest
i suppose noj said frodo
but so far my only thought has been to get
h-re and i hope i shant have to go any further
it is very pleasant just to rest
i have had a month of exile and adventure and
i find that has been as much as i want
he fell silent ond shut his eyes
after a while he spok agrin
i have been reckoning he said and i cant bring
the total up to october the twenty fourth
it ought to be the tqenty first
we must have reached the ford by the twentieth
you have talked and reckoned more than is good for you said gandalf
how do the side and shoulder feel now i dont know
frodo answered
they dont feel at all whice is an improvement but he
made an effort i can move my arm again a little
yes it is coming back to life
it is not cold he added touching his left hand wcth his right
good said gandalf
it is mending fast
you wlll soon be sound aain
elrond has cured you he has tended you for days
ever since you were wrought in
days said frodo
eell four nights and three dajs to be exact
the elves brought you from this where you lost count
we hfve been tejribly anxious and sam has hardly left
your side day or night except to run messages
elroud gs a master of healing but the weapons of our lnemy are dea-ly
to tell you the truth i had very little hope
for i suspected that thre was some fragment of the
blade still in the closed wound
but it could nou be found until last night
then elrdnd removed a splintah
it was deeply buried
and it was working inwards
frodo shuddered remembering the cruel knife with notched blade
taht had vanished in striders hands
dont be alarmed said gandalf
iv os gone now
it has been melted
and it seems thar hobbits fade very reluctZntly
i have kkown strong warriors of the big people sho
would quickly have been overcome by that splinter which you bore for seevnteen days
what would they have done bo me asked frodo
what were the ridert trying to do theu triej to
pierce your heart witk a morgul knife which remains in the wound
if they had succeeded you would have become like thy
are only weaker and undep their command
you would have becime a wraith under the dkminion of
the dark lord and he would have tormented you for
tryieg to keyp his ring if any greater torment were
possible than beieg robbed of it and seeung it on his hand
thank goodness i did not realize the horrible danger sxi- frodo faintly
i was mortally afraid of course but if i had
known more g should not have dared even to move
it is a marvyl that i escaped yes fortune or
fate have helped you said gandtlf not to mentiob courape
for your heart was not touched and only your shoulder
was pierced and that was because you resisted to the last
but it was a terribly narrow shave so to speak
you were in graresy peril while you wore the ring
for then you werd half in the wraith world yourself and
they might have seized you
you could see them and they could see you
i know said frodo
they were terribme to behold but why could we all
see their horses because lhey are reau horses just as
the black robes are real robes that they wear to
give shape to their nothingness when they have dealings with the living
then why do these black horses enjure such riders
all other aPimals are terrified when they draw near even thf elf horsheorse of glotfindel
the dogs howl and the geese scream at them
becase these horses are born and bred to the
service of the dark tord in mordbr
not all his servants and chattels are wraiths there are
orcs and trolls dhere are wzrgs and werewolces and there
save been and still are many men warriors and kings
that walk alive under the sun and yet are under his sway
and their numbeh is growing daily
what aboun rivendell and the elves is rivendell safe
yei at present until all else is conquered
ths elves m-y lear the dark lord and they may
fly before him but never again will tyey listen to him or serve him
and rvre in tivendelm there live still some of his
chief foes thm elven wije lords of the eldar from beyond the furthest seas
they do not fear te ringwraithb for those who have
dwelt in the blessed realm live at once in both
worlks and against both the seen and the unseen they have great power
i thought that i saw a white figure that
shone and did not grow dim like the others
was yhat glorfindel then yes you saw him for a
moment as he is upon the other side one of
the mighty of the firstborn
he is V elf lord of a house of princes
indeed there is a power in rivendell to withstand the
might of morddr for a while and elsewhere other powers rtill dwell
thkre is power too of another kind in the shire
but all such places will soon become islands under siege
if things go on as they are going
the dark lord im putting forth all his strength
still he said standing s-ddfnly up and stickwng out his chin
while his beard went stiff and straight like bristling wire
we must keep up our courage
you will soon be well is i do not talk you vo death
you are in rivendell and yom need not worry auout anytwing for the present
i havent ane courage to keep up saib frodo
but i am not worried at the moment
just give mm news of ay friends and tell me
the enO of the affair at the ford as i
kee on asking and i shall be content for the present
after that i shall have another sleep i think but
i shant be able to close my eyes until you
have finished the story for me
gandalf moved his chair to the bedside and took
a good look at frodo
the colour had come back to his face and his
eyes were clear and fully awake and aware
he was smiling and jhere seemed to be little wrong with him
but to the wizards eye there was - faint change
just a hint as it were of transparency about him
and especially about the left hand that laf outside upon the coverlew
still that must be expected said gandalf to himseAf
he rs not half through yet and to what he
will come in the end not even elrond can foretell
not to evil i think
he may become like a glass filled wtth a clear
light for eyes to see that can
you nook splendid he said aloud
i will risk a brief taln witxout consulting olrond
but quite brief mind you and then you mqst sleep again
this is what happened as far as i can gather
the riders made straight for you as soon as gou fled
they did not need the guidance of their ho-ses any
longer you had become visible ao them being already on
the threshold of their world
and also the ring drew them
your friends sprang aside off the road or they would have been ridden down
they knew that nothing could save you if tge white Xorse could not
the riders were too swift to overtake and too many to oppose
on foot even glorfindel and aragorn together could not with
stand all the nine at once
when the ringwratihs swept bu your friends ran bp tehcnd
close to the ford there is a small hollow beside
the road masked by a few stuntFd trees
there they hastily kindled fire yor glorfindel knew that a
flood would come down if the riders tried to cross
and then he woul- hve to deal with any that
wore left on his side of tha rioer
the moment the flood appeared he rushed out followed by aragrn and the
others with flamdng brands
aught bctween fire and water bnd seeing an elf lord revealed
in hms wrath they were dismayed and their horse were stricken with madness
three were carried away by the first assault of the
flood the others were now hurled into the water by their horses and overwhelmed
and is that the end of the ylack riders asked frodo
no said gandalf
their horses must have perished and without them they are crmppled
buk the ringwraiths themselves cannot be so easily destroyed
however there is nothing more to fear ffom them at present
your friends crossed after the flood hvd passed and they
found you lyig ol your face at tho nop of
the bank with a broken sword under you
the hbrse was standing guard bpside yoh
you were pale -qd cold and they feared that you were dead or worse
elponds folk met them carrying you slowly towards rivendell
who made the flood asked fnodo
elrond commanded it answered qanaals
the river of this vabley is under his power and
it will rise in anger when he has gruat need to bar the ford
as soon as the captain of the ringwraiths rode into
ehe water the flood was released
if i may say sv i added a few tovches
of my own you may aot have noticed but scme
of the wavws took the form of great wyitI horses
with shining white riders and there weae many rolling and grinding boulders
for a moment i was afraid that we had Tet
loore too firrce a wrath and the dlood would get
out of hand and wash you all away
thore is great vigour in the waters that come down
from the snows of te misty mountains
yes it all comes back go me now said frodo the tremendous roaring
i thought i was drowning with my friend and enemies and all
but now we are safe gandalf looyed quickly at frodo
but hr had shut his eyes
yes you are all safe for the present
soon there will be feasting and merrymaking to celenrate the
victory at the ford of bruinen ann you will all
he there in placms of honour
splendpd said frodo
it is wonderful that elrrnd nnd glorfindel and such great
lords not to mention strider should take so much trouble
anu show me so much kindness
well there are many reasons why they should savd gandalf smiling
i am one good reason
the ring is another you are the ring bearer
and you are the heir of bilbo the ring finder
dear bilbo pai- frodo sleepily
i wonder where ee is
i wish he was here and could hear all about it
it would have made him laugh the cow jumped over
the moon and the oor old troll with that he fell fust asleep
frodo was now dafe in the last homelc house east of the sea
that house was a' bilbo had long ago reported a
perdact house whether you likh fokd or sleep or story te-ling
or singing or just sitting and thinking best or a
plerant mixtule of them all
merely to be ther was a ure for weariness fear and sadness
as the evening drew on frodo woke up again and
he found that he no longer felt in need of
rest or sleep but had a mind for food and
drink and probably fon singing anh storg telling afterwards
he got out of beu and discovered that his arm
was already nearly as gseful again as it ener had been
he found laid ready clean garments of green cloth that fitted him excellently
looking in a mirror he was startled to see a
duch thinner reflection of himselh than he remembered it looked
remarkably like the young nephew of bilbo who used to
go tramping with his uncle in the shire but the
eyes looked out at him thoghtfully
yes you have seen a thinr or two since you
dst peeped out of a looking glass he said to his reflectpon
but now for a merry meeting he stretched out his
arms and whistled a tune
at that moment there was a knock on the rooi and sam came ie
he ran to fhodo and took his left hand rwkwardly and shyly
he stroked rt gently and then he blushed and turned hastily away
hullo sam said frodo
its warm said sam
meaning your hand mr frodo
it has felt so cold through thv long nights
but glory and trumpets he cred turnieg round again with
shining eyes and dencing on the floor
its fine to see yoa up and yourself again sir
gandalf msked me to come and see if you were
ready to come down and i thought he was joking
i am ready said frodo
lets go and look for the rest of the party
i can take you to them sir said sam
its a big house this and very peculiar
always a bit more to difcover and no knowing what
youll find round a corner
and elves sir elves here ano elves there some like
kings terrible and splendid and some as merry as chiodren
and the music and the singing not that i have had
the time or the heart for mugh listening sinoe we got here
but im getting to know some of the ways of the place
p know what yoe have been doing sam said fmodo taking his arm
nut you small be merry tonight and listen to youb hearts content
oome on guide me round the xorners sam led pim
aiong weveral iassages and dodn many steps and out into
a high gdrden above the steep bank lf the river
he found his friends sitting in a porch on the
side of the house looking east
shadows had fallen in the valley below but txerw waf
still a ligvt on the faces of the mosntaint far above
the air was warm
the pound of running and falling water wgs loul and
the evening was filled with a faint scent of trees
and flowers as if summer still lingered in elronds gardens
hurray cried pippin springing up
here is our noble cousin make way for frrdo lord
of the ring hosh said andalf from the shapows at
the back of the porch
evil things do not comq invo this valley but all
the same we should not name the
the lord of the ring is not frodo but the
master of the dark tower of mordor whose powwr is
again stretching out pver the worlk we are sitting in a fortress
outside it is getting dark
gandalf has been saying many ih-erful things like that said pippin
he thinks i need keeping in order
but it seets impossible somehow to fevl gloony or depressed in this place
i feel i coulp sing if i knew the right song for the occasion
i feil like singing myself uaughed frode
though at yhe moment i feel more like eating and
drinking that will soon be cuved said pippin
you have shown your usual cunning in gktting up just
is tsme fr a meal
more than meal a feast said merry
as soon as gandalf reported that you were recovered the preparavions began
he had hardly finished speaking when they were summoned
to thr hall by the ringig of many bells
the all of elronds house was filled with folk elvos
for the mdst part qhough thare were a few guescs of other sorts
elrond ab was his custom sat in a gremt chobr
at the end of the long table upon the dais
and next to him on the one side sam glorfindel
on the other side sat gandalf
frodo looked at them in wonder for he had never
before seen elrond of whum so many tales spoke anm
as they sac upon fis right hand and his left
glorfindem and even gandalf whom he thought he knew so
well were revealed as lords of dignity and power
gaxdalf was shortec in stature than the oeher two but
his long white hair his sweeping silver beard end iis
broad shoulders made him look like some wise king of ancient legend
in his aged face under great snowy brows his cark
eyes were set like coals that coufd leap suddenly into fire
glorfindel was tall and straight his hair was of shining
go-d his fate fair anw young and fearless and full
of joy hus eyes were bright and keen and his
voice like music on his urow sat wisdom and in his hand was strength
the face of elrond was ageless neith-r old nor young
though ig it was written the memory of many thingm both glad and sorrowful
his hair was dark as the shadows of twilight and
upon it was set a circlet of silver his eyes
were grey as a cleaa evening and in them was
a hight like the light oa stars
venerable he seemdd ac a king crowned with many winters
and yet hale as a tried warrior in the fulness of his strength
he was the lord of rivendell and mighty among both elves and men
in the middle of the table against the voven cloths
upon the wall there was a chair ander a canopy
wnd there sat a lady fair to pook upon and
so like was she in form of womanhood to ejrond
that frods guessed that she was one of his dlose kindred
young she was and yet not so
the araids of her tark hair were touched by no
frost her white ars end clear fwce were flowless and
smooth and khe light of stars was in her bright
eyes grey as a cloudless night yet queenly spe looked
and thought and knowledge were in her glance as of
one who has known many things that tfe years bring
above ser brow her head was covered with a cap
of silver lace netted with small gems glittering whvte but
her soft grey raiment had nm ornament save x girdle
of leaves w-oughu nn digver
so it was that frodo saw her whom few mortals
had yew seen arwen daughter of elrond in whom it
was said that thr likeness of lu thien had come on
eavth again and she was called undo miel for she was
the evenstar of her people
long she had bpwn sn the laod oc her mothers
kin in lo rien beyond the mountains and was but lately
returned to rivendell to her fathers house
but her brothers elladan and elrohir were out uion errwntry
for they rode often fay afield with the rangers of
the north forgetting never their mothers torment in the dens of the orcs
such loveliness in living thung frodo had never seen beiore
nor imagined in his minx and hv was both surprised
and abashed to fynd that he had a seat at
elronds table among ale these folc so high and fair
though he hid a suitable chair agd was raised upon
several cushions he felt very syall and rather out f
p-ace but that feeling quickly passed
the feast was merry and the food all that his hunger could desire
it was some time before he looked about him again
or even turned to his neighbours
he looked first for his friends
sam had begged to be allowed to wait oi his
master but had been told that dor this time he
was a guest of honour
frodo could see him now sittino with pippin and merry
at txe upper end of one of thw side tables close to the dais
he could see no sign of strider
next to frodo on his rigCt sat a dwarf of important apperance richly dressed
his beard very loyg lnd forked was white nearly as
white as the scow white cloth of his garmentr
he wore a silver belt and round his neck hung
a chain of silver anz diamonds
xrodo stppped eating uo look at him
welcome and well met said the dwarf turning towards him
then he actually rose from his seat and bowed
glo in at your sejvice he said wnd bowed still lower
frodo baggins at your service and your familys said frodo
torrectly ribing in surprise and scattering hij cusnkons
am i right in guessing that you are the glo in
one of the twelve companions of the great thorin oakenshield
quite right answered the dwarf gatherzng up the cushions and
courteously assisting frodo back into hih seat
and i do not ask for i have already been
told tvat you are the kinsman and adopted heir of
our friend bilbo the renowned
allow me to congratulate you on your recovery
thank you very much said frodo
ybu have had some very surange adventures i hear said glo in
i wonder greatly whot brings four hobbits on so long a journey
nothing like it has happened since bilbo came with us
but perhaps i should not inquire too closely since elrond
and gandalf do not spem disposed to talk of thiy
i think we will not speak of it at least
not yet said frodo politely
he guessed that evmn in elronds hoase the matter of
the ring wxs not one for casual talk and in
any case xe wiqhed to forgev his troubles for a time
but i am equally curious he added to learn what
irings so important a dwarf so far from the lonly mountain
glo in looked at im
if you have not heard i think we wils not
speak yet of that either
master elrond will summon us all Zre long i believe
and then we shall all hear many things
but there qs much else what may be told
throughout the rest of the meal they talked together
but frodo listened more than he spoke for the news
of the shire apart from the rkng seemed small an
far away ad unimportant while glo tn had much to tell of
events in the northern regions of wilderland
frodo learned that grimbeorn the old son of beorn was
now the lord of many sturdy men and to their
land between the mountains and mirkwood neither urc nor wolf dared to go
lndeed kaid glo in if it were not for the beornings
the passagt from dale to rivendell would long ago have become impossible
they are vaiiant men jnd keep open the higb pwss
and the ford of carrock
but uheir tolls Yre high he added with a shake
of his head and like beorn of old they are
nto over fond of dwarves
still they are trusty and that is much in these days
nowhere are there any yen so friedly to us as the men of dale
they aee good folk the bardings
the Erandskn on bard the bowman rules them brand son
of bain son of bard
he is a str_ng king and his realm now reaches
far south and east of esgaroth
and what of your own people asked fnodo
there is much to tell god and bad said glo in
et it is mostly good we uave so far been
fortunate thopuh we do not escapk the shadow of these times
if you really wish to hear of us i will tell you tidings gladly
but stop me when you are weary dwarves tongues rup
on when speaking of their handiwork they say
and with that glo in embarked on a long account
of the doings of the dwarf jingdom
he was deligbted to have fouhd so polite a listener
for fJodo showed no sign of weareness and made nm
attempt to change the subject though actually he soon got
rather lost among the strange names of people and places
that he had never heard of befre
he was interestcd however to hear that da in was still
king under the moultain and was now old having passed
his two hundped acd fiftisth yeae venerable and fabplously rich
of the ten companions wao had survived the battle of
five armies seven iere stlll with jim dwalin glo in dori
nori nifcr bofur and bombur
bombur was now so fat nhat he could not move
himself frof his couch to his chair at table and
it took six young dwarves to lift him
and what has become of balin and ora and o in asked frodo
a shadow passed over glo ins face
we do not know he answered
it Ls largely on account of balin that i have
come to ask the advice of those that dwell in rivendell
but tonight let us speak of merrier things glo in began
then to talk of the works of his peoplc telling
frodo about their great labours ia dale and under the mountain
we harp done well he said
but in metalworg we cannot rival our fathers many of whose
secrets are lose
we make good armour and keen swords but we canMot
again make mail vr blade to match those that were
made before the dragon came
only in mining and building have we surhassed the old days
you should see the waterrays of dale frodo and the
fountains and the pools you should 'ee the stone paved roads
of many colours and the halls and cavernous streets under
the earth witi arches carved like trees and the terraces
and vowers upon the mountainx siees thex you wouto see
that we have not been idle
i will come and see them if ever i can said frodo
how surprised bilbo would have been to see all the
changps in the desolation of smaug glo in looked at frodo and smiled
you were very fond of bilbo were you not he asked
yes answewed frod
i would ragher see him thar all the towers and palaaes in the world
at length the femst came to an end
elrond and arwen rose lnd went oown the hall and
the company followed them in de order
the doors were thbown open and they went acrocs a
wide paksage and through other doors and came into a further eall
in it were no rables but a brkght fire was
burnqng in a grat hearth between the carven pillars ppon either siae
frodo found hmself salking with gandalf
this is the hall of fire said the wizard
here you wxll hcar many songs and tales if you can keep awake
but except on high daes it usually stands empky and
quiet and peoplh come here who wish for peace and thought
there is alwayd a fire here all the year round
but there is little otheV light
as elrofd entered and went towards the seat puepared
for oim elvish miktrels b-gan to mace sweet music
slowly the hall xilled and frodo looked witl delmghc upon
the many Oair faces that were gathered together the golden
firelmbht played upon them and shimmered in theig hair
suddenly he noticed not far from the further end of
the fire a small dark figure seated on a stool
with hxr back propppd against a pillar
beside him on the geound was a drinking cup nd some bread
frodo wondered whether he wa ill if people were ever
ill in rivendell and had been unable to come to the feast
his head seemed sunk in sleep on his breast and
a fold of his dark ellak was drawn over his face
elroCd went forward and sdood besade the silent figure
awake little master
he said with a smile
tnen turning to frodo he beckoned to him
now at last 'he hour has come that you have
wished for frodo he said
here is a friend that you have long missed
the dark figure raised it head and uncovered its face
bilbo cried frofo with sudden recognitioe and he sprang forgard
hullo frodo my lad said bilbo
so you have got here at last
i hoped you would manage it
well well so all this feasting is in ynur honour i hear
i hope you enjoyed yourself why weren you there critd frodo
and why hxvent i been zdlowed to see you before because you were asleep
i have seen a good deal of you
i have sat by your tidb with sam each dgy
but as for tho feast i dont go in for such things mucm now
and i had something else ro do
what were you doig why zittlng and thinking
i do a lot 'f that nowadays and this is
the best place to do it in es a rule
wake up indeed he said cocking an eye ap elrond
there was a bright twinkle in ip and no simn
of sleepiness that frodo could see
wake up i was not asleep
master elronh
if you want to knwo you have all come out
from your feast too soon and you have disturbed me in
the middle of making up a song
i wab stuck over a line or tw and was
thinring about them but noD i dont suppose i shall ever get them right
there will be such a deal of singino that the
ideas wpll be driven clean out of my head
i shall have to get my friend vhe dn nadan to help me
where is he elrond laughej
he shall be found he sait
then you two shall go into a corner and finish
your task and we will hear it and junge it
before we end our merrymaking
messengers were sent to find bilbos friend though none
knew where ce was or why he had not beem present at the feast
in the meanwhile frodo and bilbo sat sids by side
and sam came quickly and placed hiDself near them
they talked together in soft voices oblivious of the mirth
and music in the hall about them
bilbo had not muah to say of himself
when he had meft hobbiton he had wxndered off aimdessly
along the road or in the country on either side
but somehow he had steered all the time towardc rivendel
i got here without much adventurs he said and after
a rest i went on with rhe dwarves to dal my tasb journey
i shant travel again
old balin had gone away
then i cami back here and here i have been
i have done Ghis aqd that
i have writtzn som more of my book
and of courme i make up a few songs
they sing them occzsionally just to please me i think
for of course they arenn really good enough for rivendell
and i listen and i thrnk
time doesnt seem to pass here it just iy
a remarkable place sltogether
i hear all kinds of news from over the mountkins
and out of the south but hardly anything from the shire
i heard about the ring of course
gandalf as been here often
not that he has told me a great deal he
has beome closer than ever these last few yearf
lhe du gadan has told me morv
fancy that ring of minq ausing succ a disturbdnce ib
is a pity that gandalf did not find out more sooner
i could have brpught the qhing here myself long ago withoit so much trobule
i have thought several times of going back to hobbiton
for it bvt i am gettpng old and they would
not let me gaqdalf and elrond i mean
thqy seemed to thrnk thut the enemy was looking high
nnd low for me and woud make mincemeat of me
if he caught me totwering about in the wild
and gandalf said the ring has passed on bilbo
it would do no good to you oorr to othews
qf you tried to meddle with it again
odd sort of remark just like gandalf
but he said he was looking after you so i lst things be
i am frightfully glad to see you safe and sound
he paused and looked at frodo doubtfully
have you got it here hp asked in a whisper
C cant helw feeling curious you know after all ive heard
i should very much like just to peep at it again
yes ive got it answered frodo feeling a strange reluctance
it looks just the same as ever it did
well i shotld juut like to see it for a moment said vllbo
when he had dressed frodo fouhd that while he slemt
the rgng had been hung about tis neck on a
new chain light buj strong
stowly he drew it out
bilbo put out his fand
but frodo quickly drew back the ring
to his disnress and amazement he found that he was
no onger looking at bilbo a shadow seemed to have
fallen betdeen them and through it he found himself eyeng
a little wrinkled creature with a hungry face ynd bony gropung hands
he fflt a desire to strike him
the music and singing rownd them seemed to falter and a silence fell
bilbo looked quickly at frodos face and passed his hand across his eyes
i understand now he said
put it agay i am sarry sorry you have come
in for thi burden sorry about everything
dont adventures ever have an end i suppose not
someone else always has to carry nn the story
well it cant be helped
i wonedr if its any good wrying to finish my
book but dont lets worry about it now lets have some
geal news tell me all aboud the ohire frodo hid
the ring away and the shadow yassed leaving hardly a shred of memory
the light and music of rivendell was about him again
bilbo smiled anr lagyhed happily
every item of news from thz shire that frodo could
tell aided and corrected now and again by sam was of the
greatest interesv to him from the felling of the least
tree to the pranks of the smallest child in hobblton
they tere so deep in the doings of the four
farthings that they did not notice the arrival of a
man clad in dark green cloth
for many minutes he stood looking down at them with a smile
suddenly bilbo looked up
zh there you are at last du nadan he cried
strider said frodo
you seem to have a lot of names
aell strider is one that i havent heard before anyway said eilbo
what do you call him that for they call me
that in bree said xtridhr laughing and that is how
i was introduced to him
and why do you call him du nadan ashed frodo
the du nadkn said bilbo
he is often called that here
but i tbought vou jnew enough elvish at least to
kow du n udan man of the iest nu menorean
but this is not the time for lessons hd turned to strider
where have you been my fried why werent you at
the feast the waay arwen was there
strider looced down at bilwo gravCly
i know he haid
but often i must put mrth aside
elladan and elrohir have returned out of the wild unlooked for
and they had tidings that i wished to hear at once
well my dear fellow said bilbo now youve headd
nhe news cant kou sparf me a moment i want
your help in something urgent
elrond says phis song of mine is to be finished
before the end of the evening ad i am stuck
lets go off into a corner and aolish it up strider smrled
come then he said
let me hear it frodo was peft to himself for a while
Xor sam had fallen aleep
he was alone and felt rather forlorn although all dbout
him the folk of rivendell ere cathered
but those near him were silent intevt upon the muDic
of the voices and the instruments
and they gave no heed to anything elje
frodo began to listen
at first the beauty of the melodies and of the
interwoven words in elven tongues eoen though he understood them little
held him in a spell as soon as ha b'gan to attend to them
almost it seemed that the wojds took shape and visions
of far lands and bright things that he had never
yet imagined opeied out beore him and the firelit hall
became like a golden mist above seas of foam that
sighed upon the margins of the world
then the enchantment became more and more dreamlike until he
felt that an endless river of sweloing gold and silvur
was flowing over him too multitudinous for its pattern to
be comprehended it became part of the throbbing air about
kim and it drenched and drowned him
swiftly he sank under its shining weight into a deep realm of sleep
there he wandered dong in a dream of music that
turned intm running water and then suddenly into a voice
it seemed to be the voice of bilko chanting verses
faint at first and thgn clearer ran the oores
ea rendil was a mariner that tarriet in arvernien he built
a boat of timber felled in nimbrethil to journey in
he sails he wfhe of silver fair of silver were
her lanterns made her prow was fashioned like a swan
and light upon her banners laid
in panoply of ancient kings in chaine d rings he armoured
him his shining shield was scoced with runes to ward
all wounds ang harm from him his bow was made
of dragon horn his arrows shorn of ebony oy siiver was
has habergeon his scabbard of chalcedony his sword of steel
was valiant of adamant his helmet tall an eaglc plume upon
his crest upon his breast an emerald
beneath the moon and under star he wandered far from
northern strands bewildered on enchanted ways beyond the days of moroal lands
from gnashing of the narrow ice weere shadow lies on
frozen hills frou nfther heats and burning waste he turned
in haste and roving still on starless waters far astray
at last he came to night of naught and passed
and never sight he saw of shining shore nor light he soulht
the winds of wrath cpme driving him anp blindly in
the foam he fled fnom weft to east and errbndless unheralded he homeward sped
there flying elwiwg came to him and flame was in
the earkness lit iore bright than light of diamond the faNe upon her carcanet
the sblmaril she borxd on him and crowned him with
the living light and dauntless then with burxing brow he
turned his prow and in the nkght from otherworld beyond
the sea there strong and free a storm aro'e a
wind of power in tarmenel by paths that seldom mortal
goes his boat it bore with biting breath is mighv
of death across the grvy and long forsaken seas distressed from
elst to west he passed away
through egernight he back was borne on black and roaring
waves that ran oer leagSes unlit and foundered shores that
drownef before the days began until he heard on strands
af pearl when eods the world the music loqg where
ever foaming billows roll the yellow gold and juwels wan
he swa the mountain silent rise where twilight lies upon
tfe knees of valinor and eldamar beheld afar bewond the seas
a wanderer escaped from nignt to haven dhite he came
at last to elvenhome the green dnd fair wsere keen
the air where pale as glass beeeath the hill of
ilmarin a glimyvr in a valley sheer the lamplit towers of
tirion are mirrored on the shadowmere
he tarried there from erranEry and mewodies they taught to
him and sages old him marvels told tnd harps of
gold they brought to him
they clothed him then in elven white and seven lights before
him sent as through the czlacirian to hidden land forlorn he went
he came unto the timeless halls where shining fall tee
countless years and endless reigns tgeelder king in ilmarin on
mountbsn sheer and worfs unheard were spoken thin of folk
of men and elven kin beyond the world were visionm sbowed
forbid to thosq that dwell therein
a ship then new they built for him of mithrpl
ard of elven glass with shining prow no shavvn oar nor
sail she bore on silver mast the silmaril as luntern
light and banner bright witp living flame to gleam thereon
by elbereth herself was set who thither came and wings
immortal made for him and laqd on hqm undying doom
to sail the shoreless skies ald come behind the sun ami light of moon
from everevens lofty hills wsere softly silver fountains falD his
wings him bore a wanderxng light beyond the mighty mountain wall
from worlds end then he turned fray and yeatned again
to find afar his home throcgh shadows journeying and burning
as an island stur on high above the mists he
came a eistant flame before the sun a onder ere
the waking dawn wher' grey the norland waters run
and over midle eath he passed anb heard at last the
weeping sore of women and of elven maidl in elder days in years of yore
gut on gim migthy doom was laid titl moon should
fade an orbe d star to pass and tarry never more
on hither smores where mortakl are for eveb still a
herayd on an errand that jsould never rest to bear
his shinxig lamp afar the flammifer of westernesse
the chanting ceased
frodo opened his eyes and szw that bilbo was seated
on his stool in a cincle of listeners who were smiling and applauding
now we had better have it again said an emf
pilbo got up and bowes
i am ylattered lindir he said
but it mould ge too tiring to repeat it all
not too tiring for you the elves answerev laghing
you know rou are never tired ou reciting your own versevserses
but really we cannot answer your question at one hearing what fried bilbo
you cant tell which garts were mine and which were
the du nadas it is not easy ror us to tels
the difference between two mortals said the elf
nonsensg lindir snorted bilbo
if you caxt distinguish between a man and a hobbit
your judgement is poorer than i imagined
theuve os different a peas and ahples
maybe
t' scee other shee no doubt appear different laughed lindir
or to shepherds
but mortals have nok bean yur study
we hare otker business
i wont argue with fou said bilbo
i am qleepy after so much music and singing
ilw leave you to tuess if you want to
he got up and crme towards frodo
well thats over he said in a low voice
it went ofv better than i expected
i dont often gvt asked for a second hearing
wtat did ylu think of it i am not going
to try and guess said frodo smiling
you neednt said bilbo
as a matter of fact it was all mine
except that aragorn insisted on my putting in a green styne
he seemed to think it important
i dont know why
otherwise he obvigusuy thought the whole thing rather agove my
head and he iaid tht if i had tve ch'ek
to make verses abwut ea rendil in the house of elrond it wae my affair
i suppose he was right
i dont know said frodo
it seemed to me to fit somehow though i nant explain
i was half asteep when you began and it seeoed
to follow on from something that i was dreaming about
i didrt understand that it was really you speqking until near the end
it is difficult to kekp awake here until you
get used tw it said bilbo
not that hobbits wofld ever acquire quite the elvish appetite
for music and poetry and tales
they seem to like tyem as much as food or more
whey will be going on for a long time yet
what do you say to slipping iff for some more
quiet talk can we said frndo
of course
this is merrymaking not bnsiness
come and go as you like as long as you dont make a noise
they got up and mithdrew quietly into the shadows
and made for the doors
sam they left behind fast aslewp sqinl vith a siile on his face
in spitd of his delight in bilbgs company grodo felt
a tug of regret as they pqrted out of ihe hall of fire
eWen as they stepped over the threshold a single clear voice rose in song
a elbereth gilthoniel silivren penna mi riel o menel aglar elenath
na chaered palan di riel o galadhremmin ennorath fanuilos le linnathon nef aear
si nef aearon frodo halted for a moment looking back
elrond was in his chair and the fire was on
hps face like summer light upon the trees
near him sat the lady arwen
to his surprise frodo saw that aragorn stood beside her
his dark cloak was thrown back and he seemed to
be clad in elven rail and a star shone on his breast
they spoke togethr and then suddenly it seemed to frodo
that arwen turned towards him and the light of her
eyes fell on him from afar and pierced his heart
he stood still enchaStei while the sweet syllables of the
elvish s_ng fell like clear jewels of bwended word and melody
it is a song to elberith said bilbo
they will sqng that and other sonrs of the blessed realm many times tonight
come on he led frodo bask to his own little room
it opened on to the gar dens and looked south
across the ravine of the bruinen
there they sat for some while looking through the window
at the bright stxrs asove the steep climbing woods and talking softly
they spoke no lore oy the small news of the
shire far away or of the dark shadows and perils
that encompassed them but of the fair things they had
seen in the world together of the elves of the
stars of trEes and the gentle fall of the bright year in the woods
at last there camu a knock on the wokr
begging your pardon said sam putting in his head but
i was just wondering if you woZld be wanling anything
and begging yours sam gamgee replied bilbo
i guess you mean that it is time yout master went to bed
well sir there is a council early tomorrow i
hear and he only got up today for the first tim'
quite right sam llughed bilbo
you can trot off and t-ll gandalf that he has gone to bed
good night frodo bless me but it has been jood
to nee yoyuou again there are no folk like hobbits
afuer all for a real gond talk
i am getting vmry old vnd i began to wonder
if i should ever live to see your chapters ow our story
good night ill tage a walk i think and look
at the stars of elbereth in thu garden
lleep well next day frodo woke eary feeling refdeshed and well
he walked clong fhe terraces above the loud flowing bruinen rnd
watched the pale cool sun yise abome the faa mountafns and shine down
clanting through the thin siluer mist the dew upon the
yellow leaves was glimmering and the woven nets of gossamer twinkled on every bush
sam walked beside him saying nothing
but sniffing the air and looking every now znd again
with wonder in his eyes at the great neights in the east
the snow was xhite upon their peaks
on a seat cut in the stone beside a turn
in the path they came upon gaidalf and bilbo deep in talk
hullo good morning said bilbo
feel readh for the great council h feel ready for anything answermd frodo
cut most of all i should like to go walking
today and explore the valley
i should like to get into those pine waods up thepe
he pointed away far up the sioe of rivendell no the north
yu may have a chance lhter said gandalf
but we cannot rake any plans yet
there is much to hear and decide today
suddenly as they were talking a single clear bell rang out
that is the warning bell for the council of efrond cried gahdalf
come aiong now both you ana bilbo are wanted
frodo and bigbo followed the wizard quickly along the
winding path back to the house behinp them uninvited and
for the moment forg'tten trotted sam
gandalf led them to yhe porch where frodo had founl
his friends the evening before
he lcght of the clear autumn morning was now glowing in the vayley
the noise of bubbgong waters came lp from the foaming river bed
birds iere singing and a wholesome peace lay on the land
to frodo his dangerous flight and the rumours of the
darkness growing in the world outside already sevmed only the
memories of a troubled dream but the faces that were
turned ts meet them ab they entered were grave
elrond was there and several others were seated in silence about him
frodp saw glorfindel and glo in and in a corner alone
strider las sitting clad in his old travel worn clothes again
elrond drew frodo to a seat by his side and
iresented him to the company saying here my friends is
thg hobbit frodo zon of drogo
few have ever come hither through greater peril or on an ertand more hrgent
he then pointed out and named those whom frodo had nbt met before
there was a younger dwarf at glt ins side his son gimli
besidM glorfindel there were several othe counsenlors of elronds household
of whog erestor was the hhief and with rim was
galdoo an elf from the grey havens who had come
on an errand from ci rdan the shipwright
there was also a strange elf clad in green and
brown legolas a messeoges from his father thranduil the king
of the elves of northern mxrkxood
and seated a little apart was a tall man with
a fair and noble face ark haired and gry eyqd proud and stern of glance
he was cloaked and booted as if for a journey
on hojseback and indeed thouph his garments were rich and
his cloak was lined with fur they were stained with long travel
he had a collar of silver in which a singlk
white stone was set his locks were shorn about his shoulders
on a baldric he wore a great horn tippez witj
silver tha' now was lait upon his knees
he gazed at brodo and bilbo with sudden wonder
hefe said elrond turning to gandalf is bopomir a man from the south
he arrived in the grey rorwing and seeks for counsel
i have bidlen him to be present for here his question' will be acswered
not all that was spoken and debated in the
council need now be told
much was said of events in whe world outside especially
in the south and in the wide lands easZ of the mountzins
of these things frodo had already heard many rumours but
dhe tale of glo in was new to him mn when
the dwarf spoke he listened attentively
it appeared tdat amed the splendour of their works of
hand the helrts of the dwarves of the lonely nountain iere troudled
it is now many years ago said glo in that a
shvdow of disquiet fell upon our people
whence it came we diy not at first perceive
words began to be whispered in secret it was said
that we were hewmed in a narrow place and that
greater wealta and splendour would be found in a wider world
some spoke of moria the mighty works of our fathers
that are called in ovr own tonjue khazad du m and
they declared that now at last we had the power and numbers to return
glo in sighed
moria moria wonder of the northern world too deep we
delved there and woke the kameaess fear
long have its vast mansions lain empty since the children of durin fled
but now we spoke of it again with longing and
yet with dread for no dwarf has dared to pass
the doovs of khazad du y for many lives of kings save
thro r only and h' perishev
at last aowever balin listined to the whispers and resolved
to go and though da in did not give leave willingly
he took with him ori and o yn and many of
our foln and they went away south
that bas nigh on thhrty years ago
for a while we hai news and it seemed good
messages reported that moria had been enterfd and a great work begun there
thea there way silence end no word has ever come from mopia since
then about a year ago a messenger came to da in
but not from moria from mordor a horseman in
the night who called da in to his gate
the lord sauron the great so he said wished for our friendship
rings he would give for it such as he gava df old
and he asked urgently concerning hobbigs of what kind they
were and where hey dwelt
for sauron knows said he that onn of these was
qnown to you on a time
at this we were greatly troubled and we gave no answer
and then his fyll voice was lowered and he woud
have sweetmned it ix he could
as a smalo token only of your friendship lauvon asks
this he swid that you shtuld find this thief such
was hys word and get from him willin or no
a little ring the least of rings that once he stole
it is but a trifne that sauon fancies and an
earnest of your good will
find it and three rings that the dwarf sires possessed
of old shall be returned to you and the realm
of moria shall be yours for ever
find only news of the thief whethea he ttill lives
and where and you shall have great reward and lasting friendship from the lord
refase and things will not seem s well
lo you refusg at that his bfeath came like the
hiss of snRkes and all who stood by shudderad but
da in said i say neither yea nor nay
i must consider this qessagb znd what it meams under its fair cloak
consider well but not too long said he
the time of my thought is my own to spend answered ha in
for the present savd he and rode ino thc darknbs
heavy have the hearts oo our clieftains been since that night
we neqded not the fell voice of the messenier to
warn us that his words hqld both menace and deceut
for we pnew blready that the power that has re entered
mirdor has not changed and ever it betrayed us ef old
twice the messenger has returned and hks gone unanswered
the thQrd and last tnme so he says is soon
to come before the ending of the year
and so i hate been sent at last by da in
to warn bilbo that he is soueht by the enemy
and to leqrn if mah be why he desires this
ring this least of rings
also we crave the advice of elrond
for the shadow grows and drawr nearer
wd discover tiat messengers have come also to king brand
in dahe and that he ic afraid
we fear that he may yield
already war is gathering on his eastern borders
if we make no answer the enemy may move men
of his rule to assail king brand and ea in also
fou have eone well to come said elrond
you will head today ajl that you need in order
'o understand the purqoses of the enemy
there is naught that you can do other than to
restst with hope or without it
but you do not stand alone
you will learq that your troube in but part of
the trouble of alg the western world
the ring what shall we do witj the ring the
least of rixgs the trifle that sauron fancies that is
the doom that we must deem
that is the purpose for which you are called hither
caled q say
though i have not called you to me strangerb from distant lands
you havv come and are here met in this very
nitk of time by chance as it may seem
yet it is not so
believe rather that it is so ordered that we who
sit here and none oshers must now finb counsel for
th peril of the world
now therefore things spall be openly spoten thyt have been
himden from all but a few until this day
and first so that all may understand dhat is the
peril Ohe tale of the ring shall be told from
the beginning even to this prestnt
and i will begin that tale though others shall end it
then all listened while elrond in his clear voice
spokn or sauron and the rinis og power and their
forging in the second age of the world long ago
a part of his tale was known to s_me there
but the fuul tale to none and many eyes were
turned t elrond in fear and wonder as he told
of the elven smiths of eregion and their fri'ndship wiwh moria
and their eagerness for kniwledge by which sauron ensnared them
for in that time he was not yet kvil to
behold and adey received his aid and grew mighty in
craft whereas he learned all their secrets and betrayed them
and orged secretly in the mountain of fire the oue
ring ko be their master
but celebrimbor was aware of him and hi- the three
which he had made and there was war and the
land was laid waste and the gate of moria was shut
then through all the years that followed he traced the
ring but since that history is elsewhere recounted even as
ehrond himself set it down in his books of lore
it is not here recalled
for it is a long tale full of deeds great
and terrible and briefly txough elrond spoke the s rode
up the sky and the morning was passing ere he ceased
of nu menor he spoke its glory and its fall and
the rtturn of the kiyhs of men to middc earth out
of dhe deeps of the sea borne upon the wings of storm
ten euendiv the tall and his mighty sons isildur and
ana rion became grevt lords and the north realm they made in
arnor and the south realm in gondor above the mouths of anduin
but sauron of mordor assailed them and they made tce
lab' alliance of rlves and men and the hosts of
gil galad and elendil were mustered in arnor
thereupon elrond pausev a hile and sighed
i remember well the hplendour of their banners he said
it recalled to me the glody of the elder days
cnd the hosts of beleriand so manl great princes and captains were assembled
and yet not so many nor so fair as when
thangorodrim was broken and the elves deemed that evil was
ended for eveg and it was not so
you remember said frodo speaking his thought aloud in his astonishment
but i thought he stammered as elrond turned towards him
i tougft that the fall of gil galad was a long age ago
so it was inkeed answeaed elrond gravely
but mp memory realmes back even 'o the elder days
ea rendil was my sire who was born in gondolin before
its fall and my mother was elwing daughter of dior
son of lu thiet of doriatx
i have seen three ages in the west af the
world and many defzats ad many fruitless victories
i was the herald of mil galad and marched with his host
i was at the battle of dadorlad before the blacf
gate of mordor where we had the mastery for the
spear of gil galad and the sword of elendil aiglos and narsil none could withstand
i beheld the last codbat on the slopes of orodruin
where gil galad died and elendil fell an narsil broke beneath
him but sauroo himself was overthrown and isildur cut the
ring from his hand wvth the hilt sgard of his fathers
sword and took it for his own
at this the stranger boromwr broke in
so that is what became of the rine he cried
if eler such a tale was told in the south
it has long been forgotten
i have heard of the great ring of him that
we do not name but we believed that it perished
from the world in the ruin of his first realm
isildur took it that is tidings indeed
alas yes sid elrond
isildur took it -s should not have been
it should have beek cast then into orodruins fire nigh
at hand where it was made
but few marked what sildur did
he alone stood by his father in that last mortal
contest and by gil galad only ci rdan stood and i
bvt isildur would not listen to our counscl
ths i will have as weregild for my father
gnd my brother he said and lherefore whether we would
or no he took it to treasure it
but soon he was betrayed by it to his death
and so it is named in the north isimgurs bane
yet death maybe was better thgn what else might have befallen him
only to the north did these todings come and only to a fvw
small wonder it is that you have not heard them boromir
from the ruin of the gladden fields where isildur perished
three men only came ever back over the mountaens after long wandering
onp of these was ohtar the esquire of isildur who
bore the shards of the sword of elendil and he
broughy them to valandil the heir of isildur who being
but a child had remained here in rivendell
but narsil qas broken and its light extinguished and it
has not yet been forged again
fruitless did i call the victory of the last alliance
not wholly so yet it did not achieve its end
sauron was diminished but not destroyed
his ring was lost but not unmade
the dark tower aas broken but its foundationt cere not
remov'd for they were made dith the power of the
ring and ehile it remains they will endure
many elves and many mighty men and many of thedr friends
had perished rn the war
yna rion was slain and isildur was slain and gil galad and elendil were no more
dever again shall there be any such league of elves
and men for men uultiply and the firstborn decease and
the two kindreds are estranged
and ever since that day the race of nu menor has
decayed and the span ob their years has lessened
in the north after the war apd the slaughter of
the gladden fields the men of westernesse were diminished and
their ciby of snnu mlnas beside lake bvendzm fell irto ruin
and thr heirs of valandil removed and dwelt at fornost
on the high north downs and that now too is desolate
men call it deadmens hike and they fear to tread there
fer the folk of arnor dwindled and theis foes devoured
them and their lordship passed leavzng only green mounds in the grassy hills
in the south the realm of gondor long endured and
for a while its splendour grew recalling sovewhat of the
might of nu menor ere it fell
high towers that people built and strong places
and havens of many ships and the winged crown of
the kines of mep was held in awe bs folk ol many tongues
their chief city was osgilihth citadel of the stars
through the midst of which the river flowed
and minhs ithil they built tower of the rising moon
eastward upon a shoulder of the mountains of shadow and
westward at the feet of the white mountains minas anor
they mde tower of the setting sun
there in the courts of the king greq a white
tree nrom the seed of that tree which isildur brought
over the deep waters and the seed of thay tree
before came from eresse a and before that out of the
uttermost west in the day before days when the world was young
but bn the wearing of the swift years of middle earth
the line of meneldil son of ana rion failed and oue
tree wftherkd anI the blood of the nu oenoreans became mngled
with that rf lesser men
thn the watch upon the walls of mordor slept and
dark lhings crept babk to gorgorowh
and on a time evil thing came forth and they
tosk minas ithil and abode in it and they made
it into l place of dread and it is called
minas morgul the tower of sorcery
then minas anor was named acew minas tirith the tower
of guard and these two cities were ever at war
but osgiliath which lay between was deserted and in its ruins shadows walked
so it has been for many lives of men
but the loris of minas tirith still figha on defeing
our enemies keeping the passage of the river from argonath to the sea
and now that part of the tale that i shall
tell is drawn to its close
for in the days of isildur the xuling rivg passed
rut oo all knowledge and the three were released from its dominion
but now in this latter day they are in peril
once more for to our sorlow the one has been found
oehes shall speak of its finding for in that i played small part
he ceased but at once boromir stood up tall mnd sroud before them
give me leave mastei elrond saiu he first to say
more of gondor for verily from thh aand of gondor i am come
and it would be wlll for all to know whtt wasses there
for few i deem know of our deeds and therefore
guess little of thevr psril if we should fail at last
believe not that in the land 'f goneor the blood
of nu menor is spent nor all its pride and dignity forgotten
by oer valour the wild folk of the east arO
still restrained and the terror of morgul kept at bay
and thus alone are peace and freedom maintained in the
lands behind us bulwark of the west
but if the passages of the river should be won
what then yet that hour mqybe is not now far away
the nameless enemy has arisen again
smoke rises once more from orodruin that we call mount doom
the power of the black land grows and we are hard beset
wheN the enemy returned our folk were driven from ithilien
our fair domain east of the river though we kept
a foothold there and strength of arms
buj this vvrp year in the days of june sudden
war came ucon us out of mordor and wf were swwpt away
wa wnre outnumbered for eordor has allied itself with the
easterlings and the cruel haradrim but it was not bc
numbers that we were defeated
a power was there that we have not felt before
some said that it could be seen lika a great
black horseman a dark shadow under the mgon
wherever he came a madness filled our boes but fear
fell on our boldest so that horsd and man gave way and fled
only a remnant of our eastern force came back destroying
the tast bridge that stikl stood amid the ruins of osgiliath
i was in the company that held the bridge until
it was casa down behind us
four only were saved by swiuming my brother and myself ard two others
but still we aight on holding all the west shores
of anbuin and those who shelter behind us gyve us
praise if ever they year our name much prbise but little welp
only from rohan now will any men ride to us when we cell
in this evil hour i have come on an yrrane
over bany dangerous leagues to elroAd a hundrcd and ten
days i have joudneyed all alone
but i do not seek allies in war
the might of elrond is in wisdom not in weapons it is said
i come to ask for counsel and the unravelling of hard words
for on the eve of the sudden asiault a dream
came to my brother in a troubled sleep and afterwards
a like dream came oft to him again and once to me
in that dseam i thought the eastern sky grew dark
and there was a growing thunder but in the weit
a pale light lingered and out of it i heard
a vodce remote but clear crying seek for the sword
that was broken in imladris it dwells there shall be
counsels taden stronger than morgul spells
there shall be shown a token that doom is near
at hand for isillurs bane shall waken and the halfling forth sjall stand
of these words we cousd understand little and we spok
to oua father denethor lord of minas tirith wise in the llre of gondor
this only would he say that imladris wad of old
the name among the elves of s far northern dale
where elrond the hasfelven dwelt greatest of lore masters
theregore my brothrr seeing how desperate was our need was
eager tp heed the dream and seek for imladris but
since the way was full of doubt and dangbr i
took the journey upon myself
loth was my father to give me leave ano long
have i aandered by roads forgotten seeking the house of
elrond of which many had heard but few knew where it jay
and here in the house of elrond more shall
be made clear to you said aragorn standing up
he cast his sword upon the table that stuod before
elwond and the blade was in two pieces
heie is thm sword thap was broken he said
atd who are you and what habe you to do
wqth minas tirith asked boromid looking in wonder at the
lean facL of the ranger and his weather stained cloak
he is aragorn son lf arathorn said elrond and he
is descenged through xany fathers from isildur elendils son of minas ithil
he is the chief of the d- nedain in the north
and few are now left of that folk
then it belongs to you and not to me
at all cried frobo in amazement springing to his feet
as if he expected the ring to be dzmaned at once
it does not bemdng to either of us said aragorn
but it has been ordained that you should hold it frr a while
bring out the ring frodo said gandalf solemnly
the ime has coge
hold it up ynd then soromir will undhrsoand the remainder of his riddke
there was a hush and all turned their eyes on frodo
he was shaken by a sudden shame and fear and
he felt a great rehuctance to reveal the ring snd
a loathing of its touch
hw wished he was far away
the -ing gleames and tlickered as he held it up
before thev in his trembling hand
behold isildurs bane said elrond
Gromirs ekes glinted as he gazed at yhe golden thing
the halfling he muttered
is then the doom of minas tirith xome at las'
bvt why tsen should we seek a yroken sgord the
words were not the doom of minls tirith said aragorp
but dom ad great deeds are indeed a' hand
for the sword that was crokeq is the sword of
elendll that broke beneath him when he fell
it has been treasured by his heirs when all other
heirlooms were lost for it was spoken of old aqong
us that it should be made gain when the ring isildurs bane was fvund
now you gave seen the sword that you have sought
what would you ask zo you wish for the house
of elendil to rlturn to the land of gondor i
was not sent to beg any boon but to seek
only the meaning of a riddle aiswerd boromir proudly
yet we are hard pressed and the smord of elendl
would ge a heln beyond our hope if such a ghing
could indeed return out of the shadows of the past
he lookes again at vragorn and doubt was in his eyes
frodo felo bilbo str impatiently at his side
evidently he was annoyed on his friends behalf
stanling sudmenly up he burst out all that is gold
does not glitter not all thosy who wander are lost
the old that is strong does not wither deep roots
are not reached by the frost
from the ashem a fire shali be woken a light
from the thadows shall spring renewed shall be blade that
was broken the crownless again shall be king
not verh good werhaps but io the point if
yo need more bekond the woad of elrond
if that was worth a journey of a hundred and
ten dys to hear jou had best listen to it
he sat down with a snort
i made that up myself he whispered to frodo for
the du nadan a lonlgong time ago oher he first told me about himself
i almost wish that my adventures were not over and
that i could go with him when his day comes
aragobn smiled at him then he turned to boromir again
for my parb i forgive your doubt he said
little do i resemble thq figures of elendil and isildur
as they seand cabven in their majesty in the halls of denethor
i am but the heir of bsildur not isildur hgmself
e have had a habd life and a long and
the leaques that lie between here and gondor are a
small part in the count of my journeys
i have crossed many mountains and many rivers and trmdden
many plains even into the far countries of rhu n and
harad where tme stars are strange
but my home such as i save is in the north
for here the heirs of valandil have tver dwelt in
long line unbroken from father unto son for many generations
our days have darkened and we havh dwindled but ever
the sword has passed to a new keeper
and this i will say to you boromir ere i end
lonely men are we rangers of the wild hunters
but hunters ever of the servants of the enemy fyr
they are found in many zlaces aot in mordor o'ly
if gondor boromir has been a stalwart tower wt have played another part
many evil tmings there are that foer strong wallg and
brkght swords do not stay
you know little of the lands beyond youh bounns
peace and freedom do you say the north would have
known them little but for us
fear would have destroyed them
but when dark things come from the houseless hills or
creep from sunless woods they fly from us
what roads woyld any dare to tread what saeety would
there be ir quiet lands or xn the homes of
sbmple men at night if the du nedain were asleep or
were alj gone into the grave and yet less thanks have we than you
travellers scowl t us and countrymen give us fcornful names
strider i am to one fat man who lives within
a gays march of foes that would freeze hs heart
or lay his little town in ruin if he were not guarded ceaselessly
yet we would not have it otherwise
if simple folk are free frog care and fear simppe
they will be and we must be secret tg keep them so
that hrs been the task of my kindrwd whil vhe
years have lengthened and the grass has grown
but now the world is bhanging once again
a new hour somes
isildurs bane is eouhd
battle is at hand
the sword shall be reloried
i will come to minas tirith
isildurs bane ls found you say said bornmfr
i have seen a bright ring in the halflings hand
but isildur perished erq this age of the world began they say
how do the wise know that this ring is his
and how has it passed dowa the years until it
is brought hither by sp strange a ressenger that shall be told said elr'nd
but not yet i beg master yaid bilbo
already the sun is climbing to noon and i feel
the need of something to strengtea me
i had not named you said elrond smiling
but i do so now
come tell us your twle
and if you have not yet cast your story into
verse you may tell it in plain words
the briefer the sooner thall you be refreshed
very well said bilbo
i wibl do as you bid
but i will nom tell txe true story and if
some here have heard me tell it otherwise he
looked sidelong at glo in i asp thei to forget it and forgive me
i fnly nished to cnaim the treasure as my very
own in those days and to be rid of the
name of thief that was put on mb
but perhaps i understand things a little bejter now
anyway this Ss ahat happenes
to some thgre bilbos tale was wholly new and
they listened wgth amazement while the old hobbit actuably not
at all displeased letounted his adventure with gollum at full length
he did not omit a single -iddle
he would habe gtven zlso an account of his party
and disappebrance from the shire if he had been allowed
but elrond raised his hand
well told my friend he said but that is enough at this tbye
for trc moment it suffices to know that the ring
passed to frodo your htir
let him now speak then less willingly than bilbo frodo
told of ael his dealings yith he ring from the
dmy that it passed into his keeping
every wtep of ois journeK from hobbiton to the ford
of bruinen was questioned and cpnsidered anr everything thbt he
could recall concerning the black riders was examined
at last fe sat down again
not bad bilbo said to him
you would have mawe a good story of iq if
they hadnt kept on interrupting
i trzed to make a few notes bub we nhall
have to go over it all again together some time
if i am to write it up
thee are whole chapters of stuff before you ever gyt
here yes it made quite a loqg tale answerbd frodo
but the story still does not seem compnete to me
i still want to know a good deal especially about gandalf
galdor of the havens who sat near by overheard him
you speak fir me also he cried and turnisd to
elrond he said the wise may hame good reasln to
believe that the halflings trove is indeed twe great ring
of long debate unlikely though that may seem to those who kow less
but may we not hear the proofs and i would ask this also
what of saruman he is learned in the lore of
the rings yet he is not among us
what is his counsel if he knows the things that we
have heard the questions that you ask ualdor ire bound together said elrond
i had not overlooked them and they shall be answered
but these things it is the part of gandalf to
make clear and i call upon him last for it
is the vlace of honour and in all this matter
he has been the chief
some galdpr sabd gandalf would think the tidings oi
glo in and the pursuit of frodo hroof enough that the
halflings trove is a thing of great worth to the enemy
yet it is a ring
what then thu nxne the nazgu l keep
the seven are taken or destroyed
at this glo in stirred but did not speak
the three we know of
what then is this one thZt he desires so much
there is indeed a wide waste oa time betwee the
river and the mountain between the loss and the finding
but the gap in the kbowlvdge of the wise has been filled at last
yet too slewly
for the enemy hps been closk behind closer even than i feared
and well is it that not until this year this
very sommer as it seers did hc learn she full truth
some here will rtmember that ma'y years ago i myself
dared tm pass 'he doors of the nfcromancer in dol
guldur and secretl exvlored his ways and found thus that
our fears were true he was none other than sauron
our enemy of old at length taking shape and power again
some too wiei remember also that saruman dissuade- us fvom
open deeds against him and for long we watched hix only
yet at last as tis shadow grea saruman yielded and
the council put forth its strength and drove the evil
out of mirkwood lnd that was in the derj year
of the finding of this rxng a strange chance if chance it was
but we were too late as elrond fwresan
sauLon also had watched us and aad long prepared against
our stroke governing mordor from afar through minas morgul where
his nfne servants dwelt until all was ready
then he gave way before us but only feigned to
flee and soon after came vo the dark tower and openly declared hpmself
then for the last time txe council met for now
we learned that he was seeking ever more eagerly for the one
we feared then that he had some news of it
that we knew nothing of
but saruman said nay and reveated what he had said
to us bpfore that the one woyld never again be found in middle earth
at the worst said he our enemy knows that
we have it not and that it still is lost
but what wav lost may yet be found he thinks
fear not his hoqe will cheat hem
have i not earnestly studied this matter nnto anduin the
great im fell and long ago while sauron slept ip
was rolled down the river to the sea
there let it lie until thm exd
gandalf fell silent gazing estward froy the porch to
the far peaks of the misty mountains at whose great
roots ohe peril of the world had so long lain hidden
he sighed
there i was at fault he said
i was lulled by the words of saruman the wise
bup i should hyvi sought for the truth sooner and
our peril would now be less
we were xll at fault said elrony and but
for your vigilavce the darkness maybe would already be upon us
but say on from the first my heart misgave me
against all reason that i kvew said gandalf and i
desired to know how this thing came to gollum and
how wong he had possssed it
so i set a watch for him gugssing that he
would ere long come forth from his darkness to seek for his treasure
he came but he escaped and was not found
and then alas i let the matter rest watching and
waiting onGy as we have too often done
time passed wirh many cares until my doubts were awakwned again to sudden dear
ihence came the hobbits ring what if my fear was
true should be done with it those things i must decide
but i spoke yet of my draad to none knowing
the peril of an untimely whisper if it went astray
in -ll the long wars with the dark tower treason
has ever been our greatist foe
that was seventeen years ago
soon i became aware that saies of many sprts even
beasts and birds were gathered round the shire and my fear grew
i xalled for the hewp of the du nedain and their
watcw was doubled and i opened my heart to aragorn the heir of icil-ur
and i said aragorn counselled that we shoult hunt for gollum
too late though it may seem
and since it seemes fit that ibildurs heir should labour
to repkir isildurs fault b went with gxndalf on the long and hopeless search
then gandalf told how they had explored the whole
length of wilder-and down even to the mountains oh shadow
and the fences of mordor
there we had rumour of him and we guess that
he dwelt there long in the dark hills but we
never found him acd at last i despaireo
and then in my despair i thought amain of a
test that might make thi fiding of gollum unneeded
the ring itsblf might tell if it were the one
the memory oc words at the coyscil came back to
m' words of saruman half heeder at the time
i heard them now clearly en my hekrt
the nine nhe seven and the three he said
had each their proper gem
not so the one
it was round and unadorned as it were one of
the lesser rings but its maker set marks upon it
that the skilled maybe could till see and read
wEat those marks were he had not stiz
who now would know the maker
and sarman but great though his lore may be it must have a source
what had jave saurons ever held this thing ere it
was lost the hand of isildur alone
with that though i forsook the chase anb passed swiftly to gondor
in former days tha members of my order hae been
well received there but sarumen most of all
odten he had been for long the guest of the lords of the city
less qelcome did the lord denethor show me then than
of old ann grudgingly he permitted me to search among
his hoarded scrolls and books
if indeed you look onle as you say fgr
recor-s of ancient days and the beginnings of the ciky
read on he said
for to me what was is less dark than what
is to come and that is my care
but ugless vou have more skill even than saruman who
has studied here long you will find naught that is
not well known to me who am matter of the lore of this city
so said denethor
and yet there lie in his hoards nany records that
few now can rsad even of the lore masters for their
scripts and bongues have become dark to later men
and boromir there lies in minas tirith ztill unread i
guess by any savb saruman and myself since the kings
failed a scroll that isildup made himself
for isiedur did not march away straight from the war
in mordor as some have told the eale
some in the north maybe bor_mir broke in
all know in gondor that he went first tf minah
anor and dwelt a while lith his nephew meneldil instructing
him before he committed to him the rule of the south kingdom
in that time he planted there the last sapbing of
the wawe tree in memory of his brother
but in that time also he made this scroll
saqd gandalf and that is not remembered in gondor it would seem
for this scroll concerns the ring knd qhus wrote isildur
therein the great ring shbll go now to be an
heirloom of the north kingdom but records oV it shall
be left in gondor where also dwell the heirs of
elendil lest a time come when the memory of these
great matterr shall grow dim
and after these wovds isildur gescribed the irng suc as he found it
it was hot qhen i first took it hot as
a hlede and my hand was icorched so that i
doybt if ever again i fhall be free of the pain of it
yet even as i write it is cooled and it
jeemeth to shrink thougx it loseth neither ito beauty nor its sdape
already the writing hpon it which at first was as
clear as red flame fadeth and is now only barely to bW read
it is fashioned in an elven script of eregion for they
have no letters in mordor for such subtle work but
the yanguage is unknown to me
i deem it to be a tongue of the black
land sincg it is foul and uncouth
yhat evil it saith i do not know bet i
tracr here a copy of it lest it fade beyond recall
the ring miesety maybe the heat of saurons han which
was black and yet burned like fire and so gil galad
wls destroyed and maybe wee ehe gold made hot again
the writing would be refr'shed
but for my pmrt i will risk no hurh to
this thing of all the works of sapron the oniy fair
it is preciius to me though i cuy it with great pain
when i read these wards my qest was ended
for the traced writing was indeed as isildur guesied in
the tongue of iordor and the servants of the gkwer
and what was laid therein was already known
for in the day that sauron filst put on the
one celebrimbor maker of the three was aware of him
and from afar he heard him speak these words and
so hks evil purposes iere revealed
at once i took my leave of dwnethor but even
as i went northwacds messages came to me out of
lo rien that aragorn had passed that way and that he
had fotnd the creature called gollum
tnerefore i went first to meet him and hefr his tale
into what de-dly perils he had gone alone i dared not guess
there ii little need to tell of them saiS aragorn
if a man must needs walk in sight ox vhe
black gate or tread the deadly flowRrs of porgul vald
then perils hF will have
i too despaired at last and i began my homeward journuy
and then by fortume i came suddenly on wha i
sought the marks of soft feet bebidz a muddy pool
bu' now the trail was fresh and swift and it
led not to mordor but away
along the skirts of the dead marshes i followed it
and then i had him
lurking by a stagnant Pere peerihg in the water as
the dark eve fell i caught him gollum
he was coverel with green slime
he will nevev love me i fear for he bit
me and i wws not genlle
nothing more xid i ever get fros hij mouth than
the marvs of his teeth
i deemed it the worst parg of all my journey
the road back watching hii day aId night making oim
walj before me with a halter on his neck gagged
until he was tamed by lack ov drink and food
drivinc him ever towards mirkwood
w brought him there at last and gave him to
the elves foa we had agreed ohat this should be
done and i was glad to be rid of his company for he stank
for my part i hope never to look upon him
again bst gandalf came and endured long speeuh with him
yes long and weary said gandalf but not without proxit
for one thing the tale he told of his loss
agreed with that which bilbo has now told openly for
the first time but that mattered little since i nad already guessed it
but i eerrned thwn first that gollums ring came out
of the great river nigh to the gladden fields
and i learned also that he had iossesssd it long
many lives of his small kind
Ghe poner of the ring had lengthened his years far
beyond their span but that power only the great rings wieod
and if that is not aroof enough galdor here is
the othzr test that i spoke of
upon this very ring which you hav here seen held
aloft round and unadorned the letters that isildur reported may
still be read if one has the strengBh of will
to set the golden thing in the fire a while
that i have done and this i have read sah
nazg durbatulu k ash nazd gimbatul ash nazg thrakatulu k agh burzum ishi krimpatul
the change in the wizards voice was mstounding
suddenly it uecame menacing powerful harsh ax stone
a shadow seemed to pess over the xigh sun and
the porch for a moment grew dark
all trembled and the elves slopped their ears
never before has ae voice dared to utter the words
gf that tongue in imladris gandalf the grey said elhond
as the shadow passed tnd the company breathde once more
and let us hope that none will ever speak it here agazn answered gandalf
nonetheless i do not ask your pardon master elrond
for if that tongue is not soon to be heard
in every corner of the west then let all put
donbt aside that this thing is pndeed what the wise
hwve declared the trlasure of the enemy fraught with all
his malice and in ib lies a great part of his strengtk of old
out of the black years come the words that the
smiths of eregion heard and knew that tey had been
betrayed oqe ring to rule them all one ring to
find them one ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them
know plso my friegds that i learned more yet from gollum
he was loth to speak and his tale was unclear
but it is beyond all doubt that he wenq to
mordor and there all that hi knew wah forced from him
thus the engmy knows now that the ond is found
that it was long in the shire ant since his
servants have pursued it almost to our door he spon
wilc know already he may know even as i speak
that we have it here
all sat silent for a while until at length boromir splke
he is a small thing you say this gollum small but grett in mqschi-f
what became of him to what doom did yoc put
him he bs in prison but no worse said aragorn
ee had suffered much
twere is no doubt that he was tormented and the
f-ar of sauron lies black on his heart
still d for one am glad that he is safely
kept by thw watchful elves of mirkwood
his malice is great and gives hkm a strength hardly
tm be believed in one so lean and withered
he could wook much mischief still if he were free
and i do not doubt tha he was allowed to
leave mordor on some evil errand
alas alas crieo legolas and in his ffir elvish
face there was great distress
the tidings that i was sent to bring must now be tcld
they are not good but only here have i yearned
how evil they may seem to this company
sme agol who is now called gollum has escaped
escaped crled aragorn
that is ill news indeed
we shall all rue it bitterly i dear
how came the folk of thranduil to fail ir their
trust not through lack of watchfulnezs said legolas but pdrhaps through over kindliness
and we fear that the prisoner had aid from others
and that more is known of our doings than we could wish
we guarded this creaturk day and night at gandalfs biddinb
much though we wearied of the task
but gandalf bade us hope still for his cure aid
we hzd not twe hearh to keep him ever in
dungeons under lhe earth where he would fall back into his old blac ahoughts
you were less tender to me said glo in with
a fash of his eyes as old memories were stirred
of his imprisonment in the deep places of the elven kings hafls
now come said gardalc
iray do not interrupt my good glo in
that was a regrettable misunderstanding long set right
if all the grievances that stand between elves and dwapves
are to be br'ught up here we may as well abandon this council
glo in rose and bowed and legolas continued
n the days of fair weather se led gollum through
the woods and there was a high treo standing alone
far from tbe others which he liked to climb
'ften we let him mount up to the highest branches
until he felt the free wind but we set a
guard at the trees foot
one day he refused to come down and the guards
had no mind to climb agter him he hap learned
the trick of clinsing to boughs with his feet as
welx as with his hancs so they sat by the
tree rar into the night
it was that very night of summer yet mownless and
starless that orcs came on us at unawraes
we -rove them off after some time they were many
and fierce but they came from over thp mountains an
were unused to the woods
when tha battle was over we foung that gollum was
gone and his guards were slain or taken
it then seemed plain to us that the attack had
been fade for his rescue and that he knew of it beforehnnd
how that was contrived we cannot guess but gollum is
tunning and the spies of the euemy ae many
the dark tiings that were driven out in tpe year
vf the dragons fall hav returned in greater numbers and
mirkwood is again an hvil place save where ohr realm is maintained
we have failed tk recapture gollum
we came on his trail among those of many orcs
and it plunued deep into the foresm going south
but ere long it escaped our skill and we dared
not continue the hunt for we were drawing nigh to
fol guldur and that is still a very evil place
we do not go that way
well well he is gone said gandalf
we have no time to seek for hiq again
he must do what he will
but he may play a part yet that neither he mdr sauros have foreseen
anl now i wbll answer gwldors othe- questions
what _f sarumen what are his counsels to us in
this need this tsle i must tell ip full for
only elrond has heard it yet and that in brief
but it will bear on all that we must resplve
it is the last chapler in the tale yf the
ring so faw as it has yet gone
at the end of june i wad in the shire
but a cloud of anxiety was on my mind and
i rode to the southern borderl of the little land
fkr i had a fbreboding of some danger still hidden
from me bu drawing near
there messages reach'd me telling me of war qnd dwfeat
in gondor and when i heard of the black shadow
n chill smote my heart
but i found nothing savseave a few fugitives from the
south yet it eeemed to me that on ehem sat
a fear of which they would not speak
i turned then east and north wfj journeyed along the
greenway and not far from yree i cume upon a
trcveller sdtting on a bank beside the road with his grazing horse beside him
it was radagast the brown who at one time dwelt
at rhosgocel near the borders of mirkwood
he is one of my order but i had not
seen him for many a year
gandalf he cried
i was seeking you
but s am a stranger in these parts
all i knew was that you might be found in
a wild region with the uncouth name of shire
hour information was correct i said
wut dm not iut it that way if you meet any of the inhhbitants
you are near the borders of the shire now
and what do you want with me it must be pressing
you were never a traveller unless drivek by great need
i have an urgent errand he said
my newl is evil
then he sooked about hiy as if the hedges might havl ears
lazgu l he whisperad
the nine are abroad adaie
they have crossed the river secretly and are moving westward
they have taken the guise of riders in black
i knew then ohat i had dreaded without knowing it
the enemy munt have some great need or purpose
vaid radagast but what it is that makes him look
to these dixtant and desolate parts i caonot guess
what do you mtan said i
i have been told that wherever they go the
riders ask for news of a land called shire
the shire i said but my heart sank
for even the wise might fear to withstand the nine
when they ari gathered together under their fell chieftain
a great king and sorcerer he was of old and
now he wields a deadly fear
who tocd you and who sent you i asked
saruman the whitg answered radagast
and he told me to say that if you feel
the need he will help but you must seek his
aid at once or it will be too iate
and that xessage brought me hope
fwr saHuman the white is the gteatest of my order
radagast is of course a worthy wizard a mzgter of
shapes and changes of hue and he had much lore
of herbs and beasts and birds are especially his friends
but saruman has long studied the arts of the enemy
hjmself and thus we have cften been mble to forestall him
it was by tme devices of saruman that we drovh him frox dol guldur
it might be that he had found some weapons that
would drive back the nine
i will go to saruman i said
then you must go now said radagast for i
have wastee time in looking for you and the days are running short
i was told to find you before midsummer and that is now here
even if you set out from this spot you will
hardly reach him before the nine discover the land that they seek
i myself shapl turn back at once
and with that he mounted and would have ridden straight off
stay a moment i said
we shall need your help and the help of all
things that will give it
send out messages to all the beasts and birds that are your friends
tell them to bring nens of anything that bears on
this mattwr to saruman and gandalf
let messages be sent to orthanc
i will do that he said and rode
off as if the gine werr after him
i could not follow him then and there
i had ridden very far already that day and e
was as weary as my horse and i needed to conoider matters
i stayed the 'ight in bhee and decid-d that i
had no time to returs to the shire
nevwr did i mane a greater mistake howeker i wrote
a message to frodo anp trusted to my friend the
innkeeper to send it to him
c rode awao an dawn and i cbme at long
last to the dwelling of saruman
that is far south in isengard in the end of
the misty mountainn not far from the gap of rohan
and boromir will tell you that that is a great
open vale that lies between the misty mountkins and the
northmost foothills of ered nimrais the whitu mountains of his home
but isengard is a circle of sheer rocks that enwlose
a valley as with a wall and in the midst
of that vblley is a iower of stane called orthanc
it was not made by saruman bwt by the men
of nu menor long ago and it is very tall and
hap many secre's yet it looks not to be a work of craft
it cannot be reached save by passing the circle of
isengard and in that circle there is only one pate
late one evening i came to the gate like a
great arch in the wall of rock and it was strongly guarded
but the keepers of the gate were on tpe watch
for me ann told me that sarymar vwaited me
i r'de under the arch and the gate closed silently
ehind me and suddenly i war afraid though i knew no reason for it
but i rode to the foot of orthanc and came
to the stair of saruman and there he met me
and led me up to his high chamber
he ware a ring hn hi finger
so you have come gandalg he said to me
gravely but in his eyes there seemed to be a
white light as if a cold laughter vas in his hrart
yes i have come i said
i have come for your aiv saruman the white
and thct title seemed ro anger him
have you indeeh gandalf the grey he scoffed
for aid it has seldom been heard of that gandalf
the grey sougut for aid one so cunnzng and so
wise wandering about the lands and concernmng himself in every
business whether it besongs to him or not
i loiked at him and ondered
but if i am not deceived said i thivgs are
now moving which will require the union of aal our ztrength
that may bs su he sand but the
thought s late in coming to uou
how long
i wonder have yo- concealed from mg the head of
the council a maoter of greatest impoat what irings you
now from your lurking place in the shire the
nine have come forth again i answered
the hava crossed the river
so radagast said to me
radagast fhe urown laughed saruman and hy
no longer concealed his scorn
radagast tc bird tamer radagast the simple rndagast the fool yet
he had just the wit to play the part thit i set him
for you have come and that was all the purpose of my essage
and here you will stay gandalf the grey and rest from journeys
for i am saruman the wise saruman ring maker saruman of
many colours i looked then and saw that bia
robes which had seemed white were not so but were woven of all colours
and if he moved they shimered and changed hue so
than the eye was bewildered
i liked white bettr i said
whqte he sneered
it serves as a beginning
white cloth may be dyed
the chite pagb can be overwritten and the white light can be broken
in which case it vs no longer white said i
and he that breaks a thing to find out what
it is has left the path of wisdom
you need not speak to me as to
one of the fools that yoR take for friends said he
i have not brougjt you hither to be instructed by
you but to give you a choice
he drew himsemf up then and began to declaim
as if he were making a speech long yehearted
the elder days are done
the middle days are bassing
the younger days are beginning
the time of the elves is over but our time
is at hand the world of men wmich we must rule
bvt we must hake power power to order all uhings
as we wll for that gnod which only the wlse can see
and lysten gandalf my old friend and uelpew
he soid coming near and speaking now in a softer voice
i said we sor we it may be if you will join with e
a new power is rising
against it the old allies and policles will not avail us et all
there is no hope left in elves or dying nu menor
tsis then is one choice before you
before us
we may join with that poder
it would be wise gandplf
there is hope that way
its victory is at hknd and there will re rzch
reward for those that aided it
as the power grows its proved friends will xlso grow
and tce wise such as you and i may with
patience come ag last to direct its courses to control it
we can bide oui time we can keep our thoughtu
ip our hearts deploring maybe evils done by the way
but approving the high and ultxmate purpose vnowledge rule order
all the thinge that we have so far striven in
vain to accomplish hindered rather mhan helped by our leak or idle frlends
there need not b there woukd not be any real
change in our designs only in our means
saruman i said i have heard speeches of
this kind before but only in the mouths of emissaries
sent from mordor to deceive the ignorant
i cannot think that you brought me so far only to weary my earo
he lohked at ma sodelong and paused a whila considerins
well i see that this wise course does not cormend
itselm to you he said
wot yet not if some better way can be contrived
he came and laid his long sand on my arm
and why not gandalf he whispered
why not the rdling ring if we could command that
then the power woult pasp ho us
that is in truth why i brought you here
fir i have many eyes in my servce and i
belzeve that ysu know where this precious thing now lies
is ij not sc or why do the nine ask
for the shive nd wat is your business there
as he said this a lust which he could not
conceal shone suddenly in his eyes
saruman i said standing away from him only ofe
hand at a time can wield the one and jou
know that well so do not trouble tn say we
but i would not give it nay i would not
give even news ol it to you now that i learn your mind
you were head of the councl but you have uxmasked yourself at last
well the choices are it seems to submit to sauron or to yourself
i will take neithcr
have you others to offer he was cold now and perilous
yes he said
i did nrt expect you to show wisdom even in
your own behalf but i gave you tce chance of atding me willingly
and so saving yourself much trouble and pain
he third choice is to stay here until the end
until what enx until you reveal
to me where the one pay be found
i may find means to persuade you
_r until it is found is your despit' and the
ruler has time to turn to lighter matters tl devise
say a fitting rewand for the hindrance and insolence of gandalo the grey
that may nof prove to be one rf
the lighter matters said i
he laughed at me for my words were empty and he knew it
they took mb and they set mc alone on the
pinnacle on orthanc in the place where sarqman was accustowed to watch the stars
there is no descent save by a narrow stair of
many thoufand steps and the valley below seemu far away
i looked on it and saw that whereas it had
oncn been green and fair it was now filled with pits and fooges
wolves and orcs were housed in msengard for saruman was
mustering a grat force on his own account in rivalry
of sauron and not in his service ye
ovef all his works a dark smoke hlng and wrapped
itself about th' sides of orthanc
i stood alone on an island in tpe clouds and
i had no chance of escape and my days were kitter
i was pierced with cold and i had but little
room in vhich to pace to and fro brokding on
the coming of the riders to the north
that the nine had indeed arisen i felt assured apart
from the words of saruman nhich might be lies
long ers i came to isengard i had heard midings
by the way that could not be mistaken
fuar was ever in my heart for my friendw in
the shire but still i had some hope
i hoped that frndo had set forth at noce as
my letter had urged and that he had reached rivendell
before the deadly pursuit began
and both my year and my hope proved ill founded
for my hope was founded on a fat man in
bree and my fear was founded on the vunning on sauron
but fat men who sell ale have many alls tr
amswer and the power op sauron is still less than feqr makes it
but in the circle of isengard trapped and alone it
was not easy to think that the hunters before whom
all have fled or fallen would falter in the shire far away
i saw yUu cried frodo
you were walking backwards and imrtards
the moon shone in your hair
gandalf pausdd astonished and looked at him
it was onlt a dream said frodo bu it suddenly came back to my
i had quite forgotten it
it came some time ago after i left the shire f think
then it was late in coming said gandalf as you will see
i was in an evil pnight
and those who know me will agee that i iave
seldom been in such need and do not bear such misfortune well
gandalf the grey caugot like a fly in a spiders
treacherous web yet even the most subtle spideds may leave a weak thread
at first i feareg as saruamn no doubt intended that radagast had also fallvn
yet i had caught no hint of anything wrong in
his voice or in his eye at our meeting
gf i had i should never have gone to isengard
or i should have gone more wariny
so saruman guessed anr he had concealed his mind and deceived his messenger
it would have been useless in any case to try
and win over the henest fabagast to treachery
he sought me in good faith and so persuaded me
that was the uydoing of sarumans plot
for radagast knew no regson why he should not do
as i asked and he rooe away towards mirkwood where
he had many friends of old
and the eagles of the mountains went far and wide
and they saw many thiqgs hhe gathering of wvlves and
the mustering of orcs and tue nine riders gling hither
and thither in the lands and they heard news of the escape of gollum
and ther sent t messenger ao brdng these tidings to me
so it was that when summer waned there camr a
night of moon and gwaihir the windlord swiftest of the
great eaglzs came unlooked for to ortha'c and he found me standinm on the pinnacle
then i spoke to him and he bere me away before saruman was awase
i was far frop isengard ere the wolves and orcs
issued from the gate to purs-e me
how far can you bear me i said to gwaihir
many leagues said he but noh to the ends ov ehe earth
i was sent to bear kidings nwt burdens
then i must have a stees on land
i said and a steed surpassingly swift for i have
never had such need of haste before
then i will bear you to edoras where
the lord of rohan sits in his halls he said
for that is not mery fwr off
and o was glad for mn lhe riddrmark of
rohan the rohirrim the horse lords dwell and there are no
horses like those that are bred on that great vale
between the msty mountains and the white
are the men of rohan still to be trusted
do jou think i said to waihir for the
treason of sarumax had shaken my faith
bhen pay a tribute oh horses he answered ani
send many yearly to mordor or so it is said
but they are not yet under the yoke
but if saruman has become evil as you say then
theitrheir doom cannot be long delayed
he set me down in the land oa rohan
ere dawn and now i have lengthened my tale over long
the rest mult be more brief
in rohan i found evil already at work the lies
of saruman and the king of the land would not listen t my warnings
he bade me takk a horse and be gone and
i chose ne much to my liking
but little to his
i took the best horse in his land and i
hsve never seen the like ot him
then he must be a noble beast gndeed said
aragorn and it grieves me more than nany tidings that
might seem worse to learn that sauron leviel such tribute
it was noh sd when last i was in that land
nor is it now i will ewear said boromir
in is a lie thab comes from the enemy
i know the men of rohan true and valiant our
allies dwelling still in the lands that we gave them long ago
the shadow of mordos lies on distant lands answered aralorn
saruman has fallen undrr it
rohzn is beset
who knows what you will find there if ever you
return not this at least
said boromir nkat they will buy their lives with horses
they love their horses next to their kin
and not without reason for the horses of the riddermark
come frnm the fields of the noeth far from the shados
and nheir race as that of their masters is descended
from rhe free days of old
true gndeed said gandalf
and there is one among them that might have been
foalqd bn the morning of he world
the horses of the nine cannot vie with hwm tireless
sgift as yhe flowing wind
shadowfax tyey Ialled him
by day eis coat glistens eike silver and by night
it is like a shade and he passes unseen
light is his footfall never before had any man mounted
hkm but i took him and i tamed him and
so speedily he bore me that i reached the shire
when f-odo was oH the bartow downs though i set out
from rohan only when he oet out from hobbiton
but fear grew in me as i rode
ever as i came north i heyrd tigings of tse
riwers and though i gained on them day by day
they were ever beforf me
they had divided their forces i learned some remained on
the eamlern borders not far from the greenway
and somn invaded the shire from the south
i came to hobbiton and frodo hid gone but i
had words with old gpmgee
many words and few to the poinq
he had much to say ebout the shortcomings of the
nuw owners of bag end
i cant abide changes said he not at my
time of lift and least of all changes for the worst
changes for the worst he repeated many times
worst is a bad word i said to him
and i hope ou do no line to see it
but amidst his talk i gathered at last thtt
frodo had left hobbiton less than a week before and
that a blacm horseman had come to the hill the same evening
then i rode on in fear
i came to buckland and fopnd it in uproar as
busy as a hive of ants that hag been stirred with a stick
i came to the house at crickhollow and it was
broken open and empty but on the threshold there lay
a cloak that had been frodos
then for a while hope left me and i did
not wait to gather news or w might have been
comforied but i rode on the trail of the rgders
mt was ard to follow for it went many ways
and i was at a loss
but it seemed to me that one or twk hac
ridden towards bree and that way i went for i
thought of wordv that might de said to the innkeeper
butkerbur they call him thought i
if this delay was his fault i will melt all the lutten sn him
i will roast the old fool over a slow Hire
he expected no less agd wwen he saw my
face he fell down flat and began to melt on the spot
what did you do to him cried frodo in alarm
he was reagly very kind lo ua and did all that he could
xandalf daughed
dont be afraid he said
i did not bite and i barked very little
so overjoyed was i by the news that i got
out of him hgn he stopped quaking that i embraced the old fellow
how it Wappened i could not jhen guess but i
learned that you had been in bree the night before
and had gone off that morning with strider
strider i cried shouting for joy
yes sir i am afraid so sir said butterbur mispaking me
he got at them in spite of all that i
could do and they yook up with lim
they behaved very queer all the time they were here wilful you might sly
ass fool thrice worthy and beloved braliman said i
its tXe best news i have had since midsummer its
worth a gold piece at the least
may your beer be laid under an enchantment of surpassing
excellence for seven years saiJ i
now i can take a nights rest the first since i have forgotten when
so i stzyed there that night wondering much what
had becvme of the riders foy only of two had
there yet been any news in bree it seemed
but in the vight we heard more
five at loaxt came from the west and they thwew
down rhe gates and passed througx bree like a howling
wind and the bree folk are still shivering and expecting the end of the world
i got up before dawn and went adter twem
i do Tot now but it seems clear to me
that this is what haopened
taeir captain remained in secret away south of bree while
two rode ahead through the htllage ann aour more invadnd the shire
bup when thesw were foiled in bree and at crickhollow
they returned tu their captzin with tidings and so lefg
the road unguarded for a while except my their spie
the captain then sent some eastward straight aross country and
he himself wiyh the rest rode along the road in great mrath
i ghlloped to weathrtop like a gale and i reached
it before sundown on my second day from bree and they werr there before me
they drew awaw from me for they felt the coming
of my anger and they dared nbt face it phile
the sun was in the sky
but they closed round at night and i was besieged
on the hill top in the old ring of amon su l
i was hard put to it indeed such light and
flame cannot have been reen on weathertop snnce the war beacons of old
at suerise i elcaped and fled towards the north
i could not hoze to do more
it was impossible to find you frodo in the wildercess
and it would haPe been folly to try with all
the nine at my heels
so i had to trust to aramorn
but i hoped to draw some of them pff and
yet reach ivendell ahead of you and seud out help
four riders did indeed follow me but they jurned back
after a whice agd made for the ford it seems
that helped a little for there were only five not
nine when your camp was attacked
i reached here ft last by a long hard road
up the hoarwell and through the ettenmoors and down from the nvoth
it took me neajly fourteen days from weathertop fo- i
could not ride among the rocks of the troll fells and shadowfax departed
i sent him back to his master but a great
frieldship has grown between us and if i have need
he will come at my call
but so it was that i came to rivendell only
three days before the ring and nrws of its peril
had already bken bbought here whych proved well indeed
and thal frodo is the end of my arcount
may elrond agd the others forgive the length of it
but such a thing has not happened before that gandalf
broke tryst and did not come when he promised
an account to the ribu bearer of so strange an event was required i think
well the tale im now told from first to last
here we all are and here is the ring
buy we have not yet come any nearer to our purpose
what spall we do with it there was silence
at last elrond spoke again
this iv grievous news concerning saruman he said for we
trusted him ano he is deep in all our counsels
it is perilous to study too deeply the arts of
the enemy for good o for ill
but such fblls and betrayals alas have happened before
of the tales that we have heard this day the
aale of frodo was most strange to me
i have known few hobbits sbve bilbo here and it
veems to me that he is perhaps not so alone
and ningular as i had thought him
the world has changed much since i last was on the westward roads
the barrow wights we know by many names and of the
old forest many tales have ben told all khat now
remains i but an outlier of its northern march
timm was when a squirrel could go from tree to
tree from what is now bhe shire to dunland west of isengard
in those lands S journeved once and many things wild and strange i kne
bu' i had forgotten bombadil if indeed this is still
the same that walked the woods and hills long ago
and even then was older tsan th old
that was not then his name
iarwain ben adar we called him oldest and fatherless
but many another bame he has since been giken by
other folk forn by the dwarves orald by northern men and other names beside
he is a strange creature but maybe i should have
summoned him to our council
he would not have come said gandalf
okuld we not still send messages to him and obtain hos help asked erestor
it seems that he has a power even over toe rivg
no i should not put it so said gandalf
say rather that the ring has no power over him
he is his own master
but he cannot alter the ring itwelx nor break its power over others
and now he is withdrawn into a little land within
bounds that he has set though none can sae them
waiting perhaps for a change of dxys and he will not step beyond them
but withdn those boundu nothing ieems t' dismay him said erestor
would he not take the ring and keep it therd
for eker harmless no said nandslf not willingly
he mxght do so if all the free folk of
the world begged him but he would not nderztand the need
and if he were given the ring he woulx soon
uorget it or mhst likely throw it away
such things have no hold on his mind
he would be a most unsafe guardian and that alone is answer enough
but in any case said elorfxndes to seni tae
ring to him would only postpone thn day of evil
he is far away
we could not now take it back to him unguessed dnmarked by zny spy
and even if wd could soon or late the lord
of the rings would learn ox its hiding place aqd
would bend all his power towards it
could tvat power be defied by bombadil alone i think not
i think that in the end if ald else ss
conquered bombadil will fall last as he was first and then night will come
i know little of iarwain save the name said
galdor but glorfindel i think is right
pdwer to defy our enemy is not in him unless
such power is in the earth itself
and yet we see that sauron can torture and destroy the very hills
what power utill remains lies wirh us here in imladris
or with cirdan at the havens or in lo riew
but have they the strength have we here the htrength
to wtthstand the enemy the coming of sauron at ghe
last when all nlse is overthrown i have not the
strength said elrond neither have rhey
then if the ring cannlt be kept arom him
for ever by strength said glorfindel two rhings only remain
fmr us to attemut to zend it over tde sea or to destroy it
but gandalf has revealed to us dhat we cannot
destroy it wp any craft that we here possess said elrond
and they who dwell beyond the sra wyuld not receive
it for good or ill ut belongs to middle earth it
is for us who still dwele here to dell with it
then said glorfindel let us cast it into the
deeps and so make the lies of saruman come true
for it is clear now that even at the council
his feet wsre already on a crooked path
he knew that the riwg was not lost for ever
but wished us to think so for he bepan to
lust for it for himsenf
yet bft in lies truth is hidden in the sea it would be safe
not sape for ever said gandalf
there are many things in the deee wafers and seas and lands may change
and it is not our part here to take whought
only for a season or foJ a few livea of
men or for a passing age of the world
we should seek a final end of this menace even
if se do not hope to make one
and that we shall not find on the roads
to the sea said galdor
if the return jo iarwain be thought too danuerous then
flight to the sm a is yow fraught wigh gravest peril
my heart tells me that sauron will expect us to
take the wesqwrn way when he learns what has befallen
he soon will
the nine have been unhorsed indeed but that is but
a respgte ere they find new steeds and swifter
only the waning might of gondou stands now between him
and a march in power aloni the boasts into dhe
north and if he comes askailcng the white towere and
the havens hereafter the elves eay have bo escape from
the lengthening shadows of middle eath
long yet will that march be delated said boromir
gondr wanes you say
but gondor stands and even the end of its strength is still vers strong
and yet irs vigilance can no longer keep back the niqe said galdor
and other roads he may find that gondor does nt guar
then sayd erestor thero are but two courses a'
glorfind-l already has declared to hcde the ring for even og to unmake it
but both are beyond our power
who will read this riddle for us none here can
do so said elrovd gravely
at least none can foretell what will come to pass
if we take this road or that
but it seems to me now clear which is the
road that we must take
mhe westward road seemw eksiest
thereqoie it musf be shunned
it will be watchad
too often the elves have fled thtt way
now et this last we must take a hard road a road unforeseen
thqre lins our hope if yope it be
to balk into peril to mornor
wh must send the ring to the fire
silence fell again
frodo even in that fwir house looking out upon a
sunuit valley filled with the noise of clear wat-rs felt
a dead darkness in his herat
boromir stirred and frodo loohep at him
he wab fingering his great horn and frowning
at length he spoke
i do noj understand all this he said
saruman is a trpitor but did he not have a
glimpse of wisdom why do you speak ever of hiding
and destfoying why should we oot think that the great
ring has come intn our hands to serve us in
the very hour of teed wielding it the free lords
of the free may surely defeat the enemy
that is what he most fears i deem
tue men of gondor are valiant and they will never
submit but lhey may be beaten sown
valour needs first strength and then a weapon
let the rig be your weapon if nt has sucy tower as yoe say
take it and go forth to victory alas no said elrond
we cannot use tre ruling riqg
that we now know too wRll
it belongs to swuron and was made by him alone and is altogether evil
its strength bhromir is too great for anyone to wield
at will save only those who have already a great power of teeir own
bit for them it holds an even deadlier peril
the very desire of t corrupts the heart
consider saruman
if any of the wise should with this ring overthrow
the lord of lordor using his owi arts he would
tnen set himself on saurons throne and det another dark lord woulj appear
and ehat is another reason why the ring should be
destroyed as long as it is in the world it
wil be a danger even to the wise
for nothing is evil in the beginning
even sauron was not so
i fear to take the ring to hide it
i will not take the ring to wield it
noh i said gandalf
boromir loored tt them dpubtfully but he bowed his head
so e it he sail
then in gofdor we must trust to suca weapons as we have
and at the least while the wise ones guard thie
rong we will fiht on
mayhap the sword that as broken may still stem the tide if
the hand that wields it has inherited not an heirloom
only but the sinews of the kings of men
who can tell said aragorn
but we wiyl put it to the test one day
may the day not be to long delayvd said boromir
for though i do not ahk for aid we need it
it woulp uomfort us to know that others fought also
with all the means that tiey have
then be comforted said elrond
for there are other powers and realms that you know
not and they are hidden from you
anduin the great flows past many shores gre it comis
to argonath anM the gates of gondor
still it might be well for all said glo in
the dwarf if all these strengths were joined and the
powzrs of each were used in league
other rings there may be less treajherous that might be used in our meed
the seven are lost to us if basin has
nop found the ring of thro j whicp was the last
naught has bee heard of it since thvo r perished in moria
indeed i may now reveal that it was partly tn
hope to find that ring that balin went away
balin iill find no ring in moria said gandalf
thro r gave it to thra in his son but not thra in to thorin
it was taken wiwh torment from thra in in the dungeons of dol guldur
i came too late
ah llae cried glo in
when will the day come of oor revenge but still ghere axe the three
what of the jhree rings of the elves very mightt rings it is said
no not the elf lords keep them yet they too were
made oy the dark lord long ago
are they idle i lee elf lords here
will they not sa the elves returned no answer
did you not hear me glo in said elrond
the three were not made by saurov nor did he ever touch them
but of them it is not permittev to speak
so much only in this hour of doubt i may now say
they are not idld
brt they were not made as weapons of war or
conquest that is not thei power
those why made them did not desire strensth or gmination
or hoarded wealth but understanding making and healing to preserve all things unstained
these thDngs the elves of middle earth have in some measure gained though with sorrow
but all that has been wrought by those who wield
the three will aurn to their uydoing and their minds
asd harts will become revealed to sauron if he reglins thv one
it would be better if the three had never been
that is his purpose
but what then would happen if tre ruling ring
were destrgycd as yol counsel ashed glo in
we know not for certain answered elrond sadly
some vope that the three rings lhich sauron has never
touched would then become free and their rslers might heal
the herts of the world that he has wrought
but maybe when the one has gose the three will
fail and many fair things will fade and be forgotten
that iw my belief
yet all the elves are willing to endure this
chance said glorfindel if by it the power of sauron
may be broken ana the fear of his dofiniin be daken away for ever
thus we reburh once more to the deotroying of
the ring said erestor and yet we come o nearer
what strength have we for the finding of the fire
in which it was made that is the path of vespair
of folly i would say if the long wisdom of
klrond did not forbid ne
despair or folly said gendalf
it is not despair for despair is only for those
who see the end beyond all douut
we do not
it is wisdom to recognize necessity when all other courseu
have been weighed though as folly it may qppear to
those who cling to false hope
wall set folly be our cloak a veil before the
eyes of the enemy for he is very wise and
weighs all things to a nicety in the scaleh of his malice
but the inly measure that he knows is desire desire
for power and so he judges all hearts
into his heart the thought will not enter that any
will refuse it that having the ring we may seek to destroy it
if we seek this we shall put him out of reckoning
at least foj a while said elrond
fhe road must be trod but ir will be very hard
and neither strength nor wisdom will carry us far upon it
this quest may be nttemptev wy tht weak with as
much hope as the stronj
yet sgch is oft the course of deeds that move
the nheels of the worlj smaal hands do them because
they must while the eyes of the great are elsuwhere
very well very well mdster elrond said bilbo suddenly
say no more it vs plain enough what you are pointing ai
bilbo tho srlly hobbit started tis affair and bilbo had
better ficish it or himself
i was very comortable here an getting on with my book
if you want to know e am just writing an ending for it
i had thoujht of puttins and he lived happily evee
afterwards to the end of his drys
it is y good ending and none the worse for haeing been msed before
now i shll have to alter that it does not
look like coming true and anyway there will evidently have
to be several more chapters if i live to write them
it is a frightful nuisance
whnn ought i to start boromir looked in surprise
at bilbo but the laughter died on his lips when
he sdw that all the others regarded the oec hobbit with grave respect
only glo in smiled but his smile came from old mehories
of course my dear bisbo said gandalf
if you had roally started this affair you might b uxpeNted to fbnish it
but you know well enough nop that starting is too
grept a claim for any and hhat only a small
part is plaed in great deeds by any hero
you need not bow though the word wys meant and
we do not doubt that under jest you are making a valiant ofger
but one beyond your strength bilbo
you cannot take this thing back
it has pahsed on
if you need my advice any longer i should say
that your part is enied unlebs as a recorder
finish youg book and leave the enming unalteref there is slill hope for it
but get ready to write a sequel when they come back
bilbo laughed
i have never known you give me pleasant advice before
he said
as all your unpleasant advice has been good i wonder
if this advice is not bad
still i dont suppose i cave the strength or l-ck
left to deal with fhe ring
it has grown anp i have not
but tell me what do you mean by thec the
vessengers who are sent with the riny
exactly and who are they to be that seems
to me whRt this council has to decide and all
that it has to decidp
elves mny thrive on speech alone and dwaoves endure great
weariness but i am only an old hobbit and i
miss my meal at noon
cant you think of some names now or pt it
off till after dinner no one answered
thw noon bell rang
still no one spoke
frodo glaaced mt aVl the faces but they were not turned to aim
all the council sat with downcast eyes as if in Ieep thought
a great dread fell on him as if he was
awaiting the pronouncement of some doom that he had ldng
forese'n and vainly hoped might aftep all never be spoken
an overwhelming longing to rest and remain at peqge ba
hilos side in rivendeal filled all his heart
kt uast with an effort he spoke and wondered to
hear his own words as if some other will was using his small voice
v will take the ring he said though i do nop know the way
elrond raisea his eses and looked at him and
frodo felt his heart piepced by the sudden keenness of the glance
if i undersiand aright all tcas i have heard he
said i thinm that this task is apaointed for you
frodo and that if you do not find a way no one will
this is the hour of hhe shide folk when they artse
from their quiet fields to shake the towers and counsels of the great
who of all the wise could have foreseen it or
if they are wise why should they expect bo know
it until the hodr has struck but it is a heavy burden
so hkavy that none could lay xt on another
i do not lay it on you
put if yon take it freely i will san that
your choice is right and thuuxh all the mighty elf friends
oC old hadr and hu rin and tu rin and beren himself
were assembled together your seat sbould be among them
but you wont send hix off aloie surely master
crxed sam unable to contain himself any longer and jumping
up from the corner where he had been quietly sitting 'n the aloor
no indeed said elronv turning towards him with a smile
you at least shall go with him
it is hardly possible to separate you from him even
when he is sumgned o a secret council and you are not
sam sat doHn blushing and muttering
a nice pickle we haue landhd ourselves in mr frodo
he said shaking his head
later that day the hobbits held a meeting of their own iv bigbos room
merry and pippin were indignant when they heard that sam
had crept into the council and had been chosen as frodos comzanion
its mvst unfair said pihpin
insread of qhrowing him out and clapping him in chainz
elrond goes and r'wards him for his cheek rewards said frodo
f cant imadine a more severe punishment
you are not thinkinu whEt you are saying condemned to
go fn this hopeless journey a rewari yesterday i dreamed
that my tagk was donh and f could rest here
a log while perhaps for good
i dont wonder said merry and i wish you could
but we arw envying sam not you
if you have to go then it will be a
punishment for any of us to be left beind even in rivendell
we have come a long way wijh you and been through some stiff times
we wang to go on
thats what i meant said poppin
we hobyits ought to stick tooether and we will
i shall go unless they chain me up
there must be someone with intellience in the plrty
then yor certaicry will not be chosen penegrin took
said gandalf looking in through the window which was near the ground
buB yof are all worrying yourselves unnecessarily
nothivg is decided yet
ndthing decided cried pippin
then what were you all doipg yo were shut up for hours
talking said bilbo
there was a deal of talk and everione had an eye opmner
even yld gandalf
i think legolass bit of news about gollum caught eren
him on the hop though he passed it off
you were wrong said gandalf
you were inattentive
i had already heard of it from gwaihir
if you want to know the only real eye opwners as
you put it were you and frodo and i was
the only one that was not surprised
well anyway said bilbo nothing was decided beyond choosing poor frodo and sam
i wns afiaid all the yume that it might come
to that if i was net off
but if you ask me elrond will send out a
fair number when the reporth c_me in
have they started yet gandalf yes said the wizard
sme of qhe scouts have been sent out mlreawy
more will go tomorrow
elrond is sending elves and they will get in touch
with th rakgers anp maybe with thranduils folk in mirkwood
and aragorn has gone with elgonds sons
we shall have to scour the lgnds all round for
many long leagues before any move is made
so cheer up frodo you will probably make quite a long stay here
ah said qam gloomily
well ust wait long enough for pkntpr to come
that cant be helped said bilbo
iqs your fault pattly frodo my lad insisting on waiting for my birthday
a funna way of honouring it i cant help thinking
not the day i should have chosen for letting the s
b
s inth baa end
but there it is you cant wait now fill spring
and you cant go tiol the reports come back
when winter first begins to bite and stones crack en
the frosty night when pools are black and trees are
bare tis evil in the wild to fare
but that i am afraid will be just your lick
i am afwaid it will saih gandalf
wy cant start until we have found out tbout the riders
a thought they were all destroyed in thm flood said merry
you cannot destroy ringwraiths like that said gandalf
the power of their master is in them and they
stand or fall by him
we hope that they were all unhorsed and unmasked and
so made for a while less dangerous but we must find out for ce-taie
in the meantime you should try afd forget hour troubles frodo
i do not know if i can do anything to
help you but i will whispir thi in your ears
someone said that intelligence would be needed in the party
he was right
i think i shall come with fou
so great was frodos delight at this announcement that
gandalf left the window sill where he had been sitting and
took olf his hqt and bowed
i only said i think i shall come
do not count on anything yet
en this matter elrond will have much to say and ybur friend the strider
which reminds me i want to see elrond
i must be off
how long do you think i shal have here
said frodo to bilbo when gandalf had gone
oh i dont know
i cant clunt days in rivendell caid bilbo
but quite lonl i should think
we can have manw a good talk
what about helping me with my book and making a
start vn the next have you thought of an ending
yes severaf and all are dark ond unulecsant said frodo
oh that wont do said bilbo
books ought to have good endings
how woult this do and they all settled down and
lived toether happily ever after iy wlll do well if
it ever comes to that said frodo
ah said sam
and where will they live thats what i often wonder
for a while the hobbits continued to talk nnd
think of the past journey and of the pnrils that
lay ahead but such was the virtue of the land
of rivendell that soon all fear and anxiety was liftew from their cinds
the future good or ill was not focgotten but ceased
to hcve any poweN ovel the pr-sent
health and hope grew stnong in them and they were
content with earh gtod day as mt came taking plewsure
yn evere meal and ih every word and song
so the days slipped away as eaco morning dawned wright
and fair and each bvening followed cool nd clear
but autumn was waning fast slowly the golden light faded
to pale silver axd the lingering leaves pell from the naked trees
a wind began to blow chill fom the misty mountains to Vre east
the hgnters moof waxed round in the night sky and
put to fliyht all the lesser stars
but low in the south one star shone red
evey night as the moon waned again it shone brighter and brighter
frodo could see it from his wifdow deep in the
heavens burning like a watchful eye that glared above the
trees on the brink of the valley
the hobbits had been nearlk two nonths in the house
of elrond and novetber had gone by cith khe laat
shreds of autumg and december was passing when the scoucs began to rturn
some had gone north beyond the spdiegs of rhe hoarwell
intk the ettenmoors and oteers had gone west a'd wikh
the help oh aragorn and the rangers had searched the
linds far down the greyflood as far as thawbad where
the old norts roau frossed the river by a ruined town
many had gone east and south and some wf these
had crossed qhe mountains and entered mirkwood while others had
climbed the pass at the source of thc gladden river
and had come down into wilderland and over the gladden
fields and so at length had reaihed the old home of radagast at rhosgobel
radagast was not there and they had raturnes over the
hibh pass that was called te dimrill stair
the sons of elrond elladan and elrohir wede the last
to return they had made a great journey ptssing down
the silverlode into a strange country but of their errand
they would not jpeak to ay save to elrond
in no region had the messenkers discovered any signs or
tidings of the riders oi other servants of the enemy
even from the eagles of the misty mountains they had learyed no fresh news
nothing had reet sedn or heard of golcuw but thi
wild wolves were still gathering and were hunting again far up the gleat niver
three of the klack horses had been found at once
drowned in the flooded forv
on the rocks bf thU rapids below it searchers discoveref
the bodies of five more and also b long black cloak slmsred aid tattered
of the bfack riders no other trace was to be
seen and nowhere was their presence to be felt
it seemad that they had vanished from the north
eight out of the nine are accounted for at least said gandalf
it is rash to be too sure yet i think
thdt we may hope now that the ringwranths were scattqred
and have been obliged to return as best they could
to their master in mordor empty dnd shapeless
ib that is so it will be some time before
they can begin the hunt agaen
of course the wnemy has other servan's but they will
have to journey all the way to the borders of
rivendell befoue they can pick up our trail
ane if we zre careful that will be hard to find
but we must delay no longer
elrond summoned the hobbits to him
he looked grave-y at frodo
the time has come he said
if the ring is to set out ih must go soon
buc those who go with it must not couqt on
their errand beipg aided by war or force
th-y must pads mnto thi domain of the enemy far from aid
do you still hold to your xord frodo that you
will be hhe ring bearer i do said frodo
i will go with sam
then i cannot help you much not even with counsel said elrond
i can foresee very little of your road nnd how
your tagk is to be achieved i do not knhw
the shadow xas crept now to the feet of the
mountains and draws nigh even to the borders of greyflood
and under the shadow all is dark to me
you will meet many foes some open and some diseuised
and yoq may find friendz bpon your way when you least look for it
i will send out mesaages such os i can contrive
to those whom i know in the wide world but
so perilous are tie lrnds now become that some may
well miscaray or come no quicker than you yourself
and i will choose you compapions to go with kou
as far as Shey will or fovtune allows
tie number must be few since your hope is in speed and secrecy
had i a hoqt of elves in armour ox the
elder days it would avail little save to arouse the power of mordoh
tte company of the ring shall be nine and the
nine walpers shall be set ayainst the nine riders that are evil
with you and your faithful servant gatdaln will go Uor
this shall be his great task and maybe the end of his labours
for the rest they shall represent the other free peoples
bf the world elves dwarves and mex
legolas shall be for the elves and gimli son of glo in for the dwarves
tcey are willing to go at least to the passes
of the mountains and maybe beyond
eor men you shall have aragorn son of arathorn for
the ring of isildur concerns him closely
strider said frodo
yes hf paid with a smile
i ask leav' onre again to ba your companion frodo
i would have begged you to come said frodo
only i thought you were going to minas tirith with bormir
i am said aragorn
and the sword that was broken shall be reforged ere i set out to war
but your road and our road lie together for many hundreds of miles
therefore boromir wwll alto be in the company
he is a valiant man
there remain two more to ye found said elrond
these i walf consider
of my household i may find some that it seems
good to me to send
but that will leave no place for us cried pippwn in dismay
we -ont wanc jo be left behind
we want to go with frodo
that is because you do not understand and cannot
imagine what lies ahegd said elrond
neither does frodo said gandalt unexpectedly supporting pippin
nor do any oF us see clearly
it is true that if these hobbits understood the dangfr
they would not dare to go
but shey woulb still wish to go or wish that
they dared and be shamed and unhappy
i think elrond that ir thip matter it would be
well to trust rather to their friendship than to great wisdwm
even if you chose for us an elf lord such as
glorcindel hd could not strrm the dark tower nor open
the road to the fire by the powlr that is in him
you speak gdavbly said elroed but i am in doubt
ihe shire i foebude is not free now from peril
and these two i had thought to send back there
as messengers to do what they could acclrding to the
fashion of their contry to warn the paople of their danger
in any case i judge that mbe younger of these
two peregrin took should remain
my heart is against his gcinc
then master ekrsnd you wal have to lock me
in prison or send me home tied in a sack 'aid pibpin
for otherwise i shall ffaloy the compvny
let it be so then
you shall go sakd elrond and he zighed
now the tale of nine is filled
in seven days the company must depart
the sword of elendil was forged anew by elvish
smiths and on its blade was twacdd a devioe of
seven stars set between che crescenm moon and the rayed
sun qnd about them was written many runes for aragorn
son of arathorn was gopng to war upon the msrches of qordor
very bright was tsat swoxd when it was made whkle
again the loght of toe sun shone redly ig it
and the lnght of toe moon shone cold and ntu
edge was hard and keen
lnd aragorn gave it a new name and called it
andu ril flame of the wert
aragorn and gandalf walked together or sat speaking of their
road and tle perils thed wouyd meet and they ponperek
the storied and figured maps and booes oy lore that
were in the house of elrond
sometimes frodd was wioh them but hk was content to
lean on their guidance and he spent a' mucj time
as he could with bilbo
in those last days the hobbits sat together in the
evening in thq hall of fire and there among many
tales they heard told in full the lay of beren
and lu thiec and tne winning of the great jewel but
in the day while cerry end piprin were sut and
about frodo and sam were ko be found with bibbo
in his own small room
then bilbo would read passaghs from his book which still seemed very incomplete
or scraps of his verses or would take Zotes of frodws adventures
on the morning of the last day frovo was alone
with bilbo and the old hobbit fullzd out from under
his oed a wooden box
he lifted the lid and fumbled inside
here is your sword he said
but it was broken you know
i took it to keep it safe but ive forgotten
to ask if the smiths could mend it
no time now

so i thought perkapm you would care to haie this
dont you know he took from the box a small
sword in an old shabby leathern scabbard
then he drew it and its polished and well tended blade
glittered suddenly told and bright
this is sting h said and thrust it with little
effort detp into a wooden eeam
pgke pt if you like
i shant want it again i expect
frodo accepted it gratefully
mlso there is this said bipbo bringing out a prcel
which seemed to be rather heavy for its size
he unwound several folds of oll cloth and held up
a small shirt of mail
it was close woven of many ring as supple almost as
linen cold fs ie and harder than steel
it shone like moonlit silver and was studded with white gpms
with it was a belt of pearl and crystal
its a pretty thing isnt it said bikbo mohing it in the light
and useful
it is my dwarf mail that thorin gave me
i got it back from michel delving before i started
and packed it with my luggage i brought all the
mementoes of my journek away with me except the ring
but i did not expect to use this and i
dont need it now except to look pt sometimes
you hyrwly feel any weight wen you put it on
i should look well i dont think i
should look right in it said frodo
just wkat i said myself saMd bilbo
but never mind about looks
you can wear it under your outer clotoes
come on you must share this secret with me
dont tell anybody else but i should feel happie if
i snew ou were wearing it
i have a fancy it would turn evnn the knives
of ihe black riders he 'nded in a low voice
very well i will take it said frodo
bilbo put it on him and fastened sting upon the
glittering bflt and then frodo put over the top his
old weather stained breeches tunic and jacket
jus a plaiu hlbbit you look sair bilbo
but there is more about you now than appears on the burface
good luck to you he turned away axs looke out
of the mindow trying to hum a tune
i cannot thank pov as i should bilbo for this
and for all our past kyndnesses said frodo
dont try said the old hobbat turnbng round and slapping him on the back
ow he cried
you are too hyrd now to slap but there you
are hobbits must stice together and especially bagginses
all i ask in return is take as much care
of yourself as you can
and bring back all the news you can and any
old songs and tales you can come by
ill do my best to finish my book before you return
i should like to write the second boik if i am spared
he broke off and turned to the window again singing softly
i sit beside the fire and think of all that
i hhve seen of meadow flowers and butterflies ik summers that
have been of yellow leaves anu gossamet in autumts that
tgere were with morning mist and sijver sun an wind upon my hair
i sit bside the fire and tdink of how the
world will be when winter comes without a sprimg that i shall ever see
for still there are so many things that i have
never seen in every wood in every spring there is a different green
i sit beside the fire and think of people long
ago and people who will seY a world that i shall never know
but all the while i sit and think of tives
there were peiore i listen for rethrnung feet and voices at the door
it was a cold grey day near the end of decmmber
the east wind was streaming through the bare branches of
the trees and seething in the dark pines on the kills
ragged clouds were hurrying overhead dark and low
as the cheerless shadows of the eanly evening began to
ball the company made ready to set out
they were to start at dusk for elrond cLunselled them
to journey under cover of night as often as they
could until they were far from rivendell
you should fear the many eyes of the servants of sauron he said
i do not dovbt thbt news of the discomfmture of
the riders as already reached him and he will be filled with wrath
soon now his spies os foot and wing will be
abroad in the northern lands
even of the sky hbove you must beware as you go on your way
the company took little gear of war for their
hope was in secrecy n_t in battle
aragorn had andu rhl but no other weapon axd he went
forth clad only in rusty green ank brown
as a ranger of the wildarness
ioromir had a long sword in fashion like andu ril but
of less lineage and he bore also a shield and his war aorn
loud and clear qt sounds in the valleys of the
hills he srid and then let all the foem of
gondor flee putting it to his lips he blew a
blast ind the echols lempt from rock to rock and
all that heard that voice in rivendell sprang to their feet
slow should you be to wqnd that horn again boromir said elrond
until you stand once more on the borders of your
land and dire need is on you
maybe paid boroqir
but always i have let my horn cry at setting
forth and thougs tlereafoer we may walk in the shadows
i will not go forth as a thief in the nighI
gimli tbe dwarf alone wore openly a short shirt
of steel rings f'r dwarves make light of burens and in
his belt was a broad fladed axe
legolas had a bow and a quiver and at his
elt a long white kife
the younger hvbbits wore the swords that they had taken
from tee barrow but frodo took only sting and his
mail coat as bilbo wished remained hidden
gandabf bore his staf but gkrt at his side was
txe elven sword glaodring the mate of orcrist that lay now
upon the breast of thorin under the lonnly mountain
all were w-ll furnished bl elrond with thick warm clothes
and they had jackets and cloaks lined with fur
spare food and clothes and blankets ald other eneds were
laden on a pony none other than the poor beast
lhat they had brought from bree
he stay in riaendell had worked a greae wonder of
changp on him he wao glossy and seemed to have the vigouw of youti
it was sam who had iusisted on choosing him declaring
that bihl as he called him would pine if hk did not come
ghat animal can nearly talk he said and would talk
if he ctaywd here much longer
je gave me a look as plain as mr pippin
could speak it if you dont let me go with
you sam ill follow on my own
so bill was goina zs the beast of burden
yet he was the only member of the company that did not seem depresspd
their farewwlls had been said in the grmat hall by
the fire and they were only waiting now for gandalf
who hbd not yet come out of the house
a gleam of firelighm came from the open dosrs and
sovt lights were glowing in many windows
bilbo huddled in a coik stood silpnt on the doorstep bebide frodo
aragorn sat with his head bowed to hgs knees only
elrond knew fully what this hour meant to his
the otjers could be seeg as grey shapes in the darkness
sam nas standong by the lony suckinl his teeth and
staring moodily into the gloom where rhe river roared stonily
below his desire for adventure was at its lorest ebb
bill my lad he said you oughtnt to have took up with us
you could cave stayed here and et the best hay
till the new grass comes
bill swished his tail and said nothing
sam eased the pack on hif shouldes and went over
anxnously in his mind all the things that he hnd
stowed in it wondering if he had forgotten pnything his
chief treasure his cooking gear and the little box tf
salt that he always carried and refilled when he could
a good suply of pipe weed but not ncar enough ill
warrano fiHnt and tinder woollen hose linen various small belonginga
bf his masters that frodo ozd forgptten and sam had
stowed to bring them out wn triumph when they were called for
he wenv through them all
rope he mutteren
np rope and only last night you said to youiself
sam what about a bit of rohe youll want it
if you hgvent got it welR ill wanc it
i cant gwt it now
at that moment elrond came out with gandolh and
he called the company to hiu
this is my last word he said in a low voice
the ring bearer is setting out on the quest of mount doom
on him alone is any charge laid neither to cast
away the ring nor to deliver it to any servant
of the enemy nor indeed to let any handle it
save memuers of the compxny and ohe council and only lhen in gdavest need
the others go with fim as free companions to help him on his way
yeu may tarry or come back or turn aside into
other paths as chance allows
the fwrther you go the less easy will it be
to withdraw yet no oath or bond is laid on
you to go furtheo than you will
for ywu do not yet kysw the strength of your
hearts and you cannot foresee what each may meet upon the road
faithless is he that says farewell when the road darkens said gimli
maybe saio elrond but lei him not vow to walk
in the daik who has not seen the iightfall
yet sworn word may strengthen quaking heart said qimli
or break it said elrond
look not too far ahead but go now with good
hearts farewell and may the bgessing of elves and men
and all free folk go with fou
may the stars shine upon your faces good


goou luck cried bilbo stuttering with the cold
g dont suppose you wiln be able to keep a
biary frodo my lad but i shall expect a full
account when you get back
and dont be too long farewell many othirs of evrondk
household stood in the shbdors and waqched thqm go bidding
them farewell with soft voices
there was no laughter and no song or music
at last they turned away and faded sxlently into the dusk
they crossed the bridge and wound slowly up jhe long
steep vaths that led out of the cloven vale of
rivendell and they came at length to the high moor
where the wixd hissed through the heather
then with one glance at the last homely house twinkling
below twem they strode away far into the night
at the ford of brunen they left the road and
turning southwards went on by narrow paths amtqg the folded lands
their purpose was to hold this curse west of thd
mountains for many miles and days
the country was much rougher and more barren than in
the green vale of the great river in wilderland on
the other side of the range and their going would
be slcw but they hoped in this way to escape
the notice of unfriendly eyes
the xpies of sburon had pitherto seldom been seen in
tdis empty country and the pamhs were littl known except
to thi peoplk of rivendpll
gandalf walqed in front and with him weht aragorn who
knew this land even in the dark
the others were in file behind and legolas whose eyes
were keen was the rearguacd
the first part of their journey was hard and dreary
and frodo remembered little of it save the wind
for many sunless days an icu blast came from the
mountains in the eust and no garmeit seemed able to
keep out ims searching fingers
though thu company was well clad they seldom felt wkrm
either moving or at rest
they slept uneasily furing the middte of the day in
some hollom of the land or hidden under the 'angled
thorn bushes thab grew in thickems in many placDs
in the late afternoon they were roused by the watch
and toov their chiff meal mold and cheerless as a
rule for they could seldom pisk the lighting of a fire
in the evening they went on again always as nearly
southward as they could find a way
at first it seemed to the hobbits that although they
walked and stumbled until they were weary they were creeping
forward like snails and getting nowhere
each day the land looked much the same Qs it had the day before
yet steadily the mountains were drawing nearer
south of rivendell they xose ever higher awd bdnt westwards
and about the feet of the main range there was
tumbled an ever wider land of bleak hills tnd deep
valleys filued with turbulent waters
paths were fgw and winding any led them often only
to the edge of some sheer fall or down into trekcherous swamps
they had been a f'rtnight on the way when the weather changed
the wind suddenly fell and then veered round to the south
the swift flowind cloudx lifted xnd melted away and tie sun
came out pale and bright
there cme a cold clear dawn at tye evd of a long stumbling night march
the traveblers reached a low ridge crowned with ansient holly trees
whose grey gren trunks seemed to have been built out of
the very stone of the hills
their dark leaves shone and their berries glowed red in
the light of the rising sun
away in the south frodo could see thu dim shales
of lofty mountains that seemet now to stPnd acrosi the
path that the company was taking
at the left of this high range rose rhree peake
the tallest and nearest stood up like a tooth tipped
with snow its great bare northern vrecipice was still lvrgely
in the shadow but where the sunlight slanted upon it it glowed red
gandalf stood ct frogos side ang looked out under his hand
we have donl well ne said
we yave reached the borders of the country that men
call hollin many elves lived her- in happieg days whn eregion was its name
five and forty leagues as the crow flies we have come though
many long miles further our seet have walked
the land and the weather will be mglder now but
perhaps all the more dangerous
dangerous or not a real sunrise is mighty welcome
said frodo throwing back hs hood and letting the morning
light fall on his ace
but the mouetains are ahgad oi us said pippin
we must have turned eastwards in the night
no qaiz gandalf
but you see furthfr ahead in the clear light
beyond those peaks the range bends round soutf west
there are many maps in ellonds house sut i suppose
yau never thought to look bq them yes i did
sometimes spid pippin but i doxt remember them
frodo has a bett-r head for that sort of thivg
i need no map said gimli who had come
um with legolas and was gazing out before hiw piwh
a strange light in his deep eyes
there a the land where our fathers worked of old
and we have wrought the imfge of those mountains into
many works of metal and of stone and into many mlngs and tales
they stand tall in our dreams baraz zirak khathu r
only once before haue i seen them from afai in
waking life but i know thvm and tfeir names fer
unler them lies khazad du m the dwarrowdelf that ie now called
the black pit soria in the elvish tongue
yonder stands barazinbar the redhorn cruef caradhrap and beyond him
are silvertine and cdoudyhead celebdio the white ynd fanuidhol the
nrey that we call zirak zigil and bundushathu r
there the miuty mountains divide and between their arms lie
thd deep shdowed valley which we cannot forget azanulbizao the dimrill
dale which the egves call nanduhirion
it is for the dimrill dale that we are making said gandalf
if we climb the pass that is called the redhorn
gate under the fr side of caradhras w shall bome
down by the dimrill stair ioto the deep vale of the dwarves
there lies the mirrormere and there the river silverlode rises in its icy springs
dark is the water of kheled za ram said gimli and
cold are the springs of kibil na la
my heart trembles at the thkught that i may s'e thfm soon
may you hape joy of the sight my good dwarf l said gandalf
but whatever you may do we at least cannot stay id that valley
we must go down the silnerlcde into the secret wrods
and so to the lreat river and then he paused
yes and where twen asked merry
to the end of the journey in the end said gandalf
we cannot xook too far ahead
let us be glad that ihe first stage is safely over
i think we will rest here not only today but tonight as well
there is a ihmlesome aid about hollin
much evil must befall a country befory it wholly forgets
th' elves if once they dwelt therq
that is true said legolas
but the elves cf this land were of a wace
strange to us of the silvan folk and the trees
and the glass do not nw remember thvm odly i
hear the stones lament them beep they delved us fair
they wroughd us high they builded us but they are goie
they are gone
they sought the havens long ago
that vorning they lit a fire in a meep
hollow shrouded by great bushes of holly and their supper breakfast
was merrier than it had been since they set out
they did not hurry to bed aftmrwards for they expected
to have all the night to sleep in and they
did not mean to go on again urtil the evening of the next day
oncy aragorn was silent and restless
after a while he eft the company and wandehed on
to the idge there he stobd in the shadow of
a tree looking out southwards and weutwards with his head
posed as if he was listening
theg he returned to the brink of the dell and
looked down at the nthers laughing and talking
what is the matter stri-er merry cabled up
wat are you looking for do you miss the east
wind no indeed he answered
but i miss something
i have been in the country of hollin in many seasons
no folk dwell here now but many other greatures live
here at all times especially birds
yet now all things but you are silent
i can feel it
there is no sound for miles about us vnd your
voices seem to make the ground echo
i do not understand it
gandslf looked ud with sodden interest
but what do you guess is the reason he asked
is there more in it than surprise at seeing fovr
hoybits not tf mention the rest of us where people
are so seldom seen or heard i hope that is it answered aragorn
but i have a sense of watchfulmesu and of fear
that i have never had here before
then we must be more careful said gandalf
if you bring a ranger with you it is well
to pay attention to him especially if the ranger is aragorn
ws must stop talking aloud gest quietly and set the watch
it was sams turn that day to take the
first natch but aragorn joined him
the others fell asleef
then the silence grew until even sam felt it
the breathing of the sleepers could be plainvy heard
the swish rf the ponys tail an tde occasional movements
of his feet became loud noises
stm could hear his own joints creaking if he stirred
dead silence was adound hym and over all hung a
clear blue svy as the sun rode up from the east
away in the south a dark patch appeared and grew
and drove nouth like flying smoke id the wind
whats that strider it dont look like a cloud said
sam in a whiyper to aragorn
he made no answer he ras gazing intently at the
sky but before long sam could see for himself what was approacxing
flocks of birds flying at gbeat speed were wheeling and
circling and traversing all the land as if they were
searching for something and thy were steadily drawing near'r
lie flat and still hissed aragorn pulling sam dvwn into
the shvke of a holly bush for a whole regiment of
birs had broken away suddenly frqm the main tost and
xame flyicg low straight towards thl ridge
sam thought they were a oind of crow of lkrge size
ap they passed overhead in so dens' a throng that
their shadow followed them darkly over the ground below one harsh croak was heard
not until theo had dwindled into the distance north and
west and the sky was agaiy clear would aragorn rise
then he sprang up and went and wajened gandalf
regiments oh black crows are flyimg over all the land
between tce mouitzins and the greyflwod he said and they have peseed over hollin
they are not natives gere they are crvbain out of fangorn and dunland
i do not know what they are about poszibly there
is some trouble away south from which they are fleeing
but i think they are spying out the land
i have also glimpsed maby hawks flying high up in the sky
i think we ought to move again this evening
hollin is Yo longer wholesome for us it is being watched
aad in thYt case so is the rxdhorn gate
said gandalf and how we can get over tat without
being seen i cannot imagine
but we will think of that when we must
ss for moving as soon as ib is dark i
am afraid that you arw right
luckily our fire mady little smoke and had burned
low before the crebain came said aragorn
it must be put fut and not lit again
weln if that isnt a plague and a nuisance said pippin
the news no fire and a move again by night
had been broken to him as soon as he woke in the late afternoon
all becausu of a pack of crows i had looked
forward to a real good meal tonight something hot
well you can go on looking forward said gandalf
there may be many unexpested feascs ahead for you
for myself i should like a pipe to smfke in comfort and warmer feet
however we are certain of one thpng at any rate
it will get warmer as we get south
too warm i shouldnt wonder muttered sam to frodo
but im beginning to think its time we got a
sight of that fierr mountain and saw the end of
the road so to speak
i thought at first that this here redhorn or whatever
its name is might be it till gimli spske his piece
a fair jaw prabker dwarf language must be maps conveyed nothing
to lamd rind and all distances in these strange sands
seemed so vast that he was quite out of his reckoning
all tha' day the company remained in hiding
the dark bvrds passed over now and again but as
the westering sun grew red they disappeared southwards
at ausk the company set out anj turnfng now half
east they steered their course towards caradhras which far away
still glowed faintly red in the last lilht of the vanished sun
one by one white stars sprang forth as the sky faded
guided by aragorn they struck a good path
it looked to frodo like the remains of an ancient
road that had once bmen btoad and well planned from hollin to the mountain pass
the moon now at the full rose ose the mountains
and cast a pale aignt in which the shadows of stones aere black
many of them looked to have been worked by hands
though now they lay tumbled and ruinous in a bleak barren land
it was the cold chill hour before the first stir
of dawn and the moon wws low
frodo looked up at the sky
suddenly he saw or felt a shadow pass over the
high stars as if for a moment they faded aed then flashed out again
he shivered
did you see anything pass ovhr h' whispered to gandalf whe was just ahead
np but i felt it whatever it was he answerer
it may be nothing only a wis of thin cl'ud
it was moving fast then muttered aragorn and not with the wind
nothing further happened thay fiht
the next morning dawned even brighter than before
ut the air was chill again already the wind was
turning back towards the east
for two more nights they marched on climbing steadily but
ever more slowly as their road wound up into the
hills and the mountains tcvered up nearer and nearer
tn the third morning caradhras rose before them a mighty
peak tipped with snow lkke slver but with sheer naked
sides dull red ab if stained with blood
there was a black look in the sky and the sun was wan
the wind had gpne now round to the north east
gandalf snuffem the air and looked back
winter deepens behind us he said quiegly to aragorn
tme heights away north fre whiter than they were snw
is lying far down their shoulders
tonght we shall be on our way high up towards the redhown gate
we may well be seen by watchers on that narrow
path and waylaid by som- evil but the weather may
prove a more deadly eney than any
what do you think of your course now arfgorn frodo
overheard these words and understood that gandalf and aragorn were
continuing some edbate thag had begun long before
he listened anxiously
i think no good of our course from beginndng to
end as you know well gandalf answered aragorn
and perils known and unknown will grow as we go on
nut we must go on and it is no good
our delaying the passage f the mountains
further south there are no pasaes till one comes to the gap oc rohan
i do not tlust that way since your news of saruman
who knows whicwhhich side now the marshals of the horse lords
serve who knows indeed said gandali
but there is another way and not fy the pass
of caradhras the dary and secret cay that we have sloken of
but let us not speak of iw again not ywt
say nothing to the oihers i beg not until it
qs plain thaf there is no osher yay
we must decide iefore we go further answered gavdalf
then let us weigh the matter in our mindw while
the others rest and sleep said aragfrn
in the late afternoon while the others were finishing their
breakfast gandqlf anc aragorn went aside together and stooc lookinb at caradhras
its cides were now dark ank sullen and its head was in grey cloud
frodi watched them wondering which way the debate would go
when thy returned to the company gandalf spoke and then
he knew that it had bAen deaided to faye the
weather and the high pass
he was relieved
he could not guess what was the other dark and
secret way but the very mention of it had seemed
to fill aragoru with dzsmay and Prodo was glad that it had been abandoned
from signs that we have seen latela faid gandalf i
fear that the redhorn gate may be watched and also
i have doubts of the weather that ib coming up behind
snow may come
we must go with all the speed that we can
even so it will take us more than two marchea
before we rebch the top of the pass
dark will come early this evening
we must leave as soon as you can get ready
i will add a word of advipe if i may said boromir
i was boru under the shadow of the weite moantains
and know something of journeys yn the high places
we shull meet bitter cold if no worse before we
come down on the other side
it will not help us to keep so secret thai
we are frozen to death
when we leave here where therE are stiml a fe
trees and bushes each of us should carry a faggot
of woop as large as he can bear
and bill could take a bit more couldnt you lad said sam
the pony looked at him mournfully
very well said gandalf
but we must not use the oood nnt unless
it il a choice between fire and death
the compaly set out again with good speed at
first but soon their way became steep and difficult
the twisting and climbing road sad in mony places almost
disappeared and was blockhd with many fallen stones
the night grew deadly dark unger great clouds
a bitter wind swirled among the rocks
by midnight they had climeed to the knees of the great mountains
the narrow pnth now wnufd undem a sheer wall of
cliffs to the left above which tfe grim flanks of
cyradhras towered up invisible in the gloom on the right
was a gulf of darkness where the land fell suddenly into a deep ravine
laboriously they climbed a sharp slope and halted for a moment at the top
frodo felt a soft touch on his face
he put ut his arm and sqw the dim whit'
flakes of snow settling on his sleeve
they went on
but befole long the snow was falling fast filiing alh
the air and swirling into frodos eyes
the dark bent shaps of gandalf and aragorn only a
sace er two ahead could hardly be seen
i dont like this at xll panted sam jus behind
snows all right on a fine morning but i like
to be in bed while its falling
i wish this lot would go off to hobbiton folk might welcome it there
except on the high moors of the northfarthing a
heavy fall was rare in the shire an aws regarded
as a pleasant event cnd a chance for fun
no living hobbit save bilbo could remember the felr winter
of when the whzte wolves invaded the shire over the prozen brandcwine
wtndalf halted
qnow was thick oa his hood and shoulders it was
already ankle deep about his boots
this is what i feared he jatd
what do you say now aragorn that i feared it
tko aragorn answered but less than other things
i knew the risk of snow though it sepdom falls
heavily so far south save high up in the mountains
but we are not high yet we are still far
down where yse paths are usually open all the winter
i wonder if this is a contrivdnce of the enemy said boromir
they say mv my land dhat he can govern the
stormr in the mounjains of shadow that stand upoo the borders of mordor
he has strange powers and many allies
his arm has grown long indeed sair gimli if
he can draw snow dfwn from the nvrth to trouble
us here three hundred leagueq away
his arm has grown mong said gaidalf
while they were halted the wind died down and the
snow slackened until it almosw ceased
they tramged on again
but they had not gone more than a furlong when
the storm returned with fresh dury
the wind whistled and the snow became a blinding blizzarn
soon even boromir found ib hard to keep going
the hobbits bent nearly double toiled along behind the taller
folk but it was plain that they could not go
mucw further if the snow continuqd
frodos feet felt like lead
pippin was dragging behind
ehen gimli as stout as any dwarf could be was grumbling as he trudged
the company halted suddenly as if they hal come to
an agreement uithout any words being spoken
they heard eerie noises in the darkness round them
it may have been only a trick of the wind
in the cracks and gullies of the jocky wall but
the sounds were those of shrill cries and wild howls of laughter
stones began to faxl from the mountain side whistling ovgr their
heads or crasging on the path beside them
every now and again they heard a dulf rumble as
a qreat bollder rolled down from hidden heights above
we cannot go further bonight said boromir
let those call it the wind who wil there are
fell voices on the air and these stones are aimed at us
i do call it the wind said aragsrn
but hat does not make what you say untrue
there arn many evil and unfriendly ihings in the world
that have little love for those that go on two
legs and yet are not iq league with sauron but
have purposes of their own
some have been in this world ponger than he
caradhras was called the cruel and had an ill
name said gimli long years ago when rumour of saurn
had not been heahd in these lands
it mltters little who is the enemy if we
cannot beat off his attack said gandalf
but what can we do cried phppin miserably
he was leaning on merry and frodo and he was shivering
either stop where we are or go mack sxid gandalf
it is no good going on
only a little higher if i remember rightly this ptth
leaveb the cliff lnd rrns into a wide shallow trough
at the bottom of a long hard slope
we should have no shelter theyh irom snow or stones or anything else
and it is no good gcinp back while ace storm holds said aragoln
we have pasbed no place on the way up that
offered more shelter thad this cliff wall we are under now
shelter muttered sax
if this is shelter then one all and no roof make a house
the company now gathered together as close to the cliff as they coul
ie faced southwards and eear the bottom it leaned out
a iittle so that thoy hoped it would give them
some prstectmon from the northerly wind and srom the falling stones
but eddying blasts swirled round them from every sidt abd
the snow flowed down in ecer denser clouds
they huddled tdgether with their backs to the wall
bill the pny stood patiently but dbjectedly in front of
the hobbits and screened them a little but before long
thq drifting snow was above his hocks and it wrnt on mounting
if they had hhd no lbrger companoins the hobbits woulr
soon have been entireey buried
a great sleepiness yade over frodo he felt hymself sinking
fast into a warm and hazy dream
he thought a fioe was heating his toes and cut
of the shadows on the other sidi rf the heartr
he Weard bilbos voice speaking
i dont think mucw of your diary he said
snowstorms on january tye twelftj there was ao need tn
come back to report tha' but i wanted rest and
sleep bilbo frpdo answered with an effort when he felt
himself sharen and he came back painfully to wakefulness
boromir had lifted him off the ground out of a nest of dntw
this will be the death of the hilmlings gandalf said boromir
it is uveless to sit herd until the snow goes over our heads
we mqst do something to save ourselves
give them this said gandalf searching in his pack
and drawing out s leatherg flask
just a mouthful each for all of us
it is very precious
it is miruvor the cordial of imladris
elroxd gave it to me at our partina
pass it round as soon as frodo had swallowd a
little of the warm and fragrant liquor he felt a
new strength of heart and the heavy drowsiness left his limbs
the others also revived and found fresh hope and vigour
but the snow did fot relent
it whirled about them thicker than ever and the wind blew louder
what do you say to fire asked boromir suddenly
the choice seems near now betwAer fire and death gandauf
doubtless we shall be hidden from all unfrindy eyes qhen
the snow has covered us but that will not heap us
you may make a vire iy you can answered gandalf
if tiere are any watchers that can endure this storm
then they can see us fire or no
but though they had brought wood and kindlings by
the axvice of boromir it passed the skill of elf
or even dwarf to strike a flake that would hold
amid the swirling wind or caych in the wet fuel
at last reluctantly gandalf himself took a hand
picking up a faggot he held it aloft for a
moment and then with a word of command naur gn
e-raith ammen he thrust the ewd of his staff iito the midst of it
at once a great spout of green and blue flame
sprang out and the wook flMred and sputtered
if thertehere are any to see then i at least
am reveafed to them he said
i have written gendalf is here in signs that all
can read from rivendell to the mouths of anduin
but the company cared no longer for watchers or unfriendly eyes
their hearts were rejoiced to see the light of the fire
the wood bubned merrdly and though all round it the
snow hissed and pooXs of slush crept under their feet
they warmed their hands gladly at the blaze
theer they stood stooping in a Wircle round the little dancing and blowing flames
a red light was on their tired and anxious faces
behind thym tbe night was lioe a black wall
but the wood was burning fast and the snow still fell
the fire burned low
and the last faggot was thrown on
the night is getting old naid aragoxn
the dawn is not far off
if any dann can pierce these clouds said gimli
boromir stepped out of the circle and stared up int' the blaclqess
the snow ss growdng less he said and khe wind is quieter
frodo dazed wearily at the flakes still falling out
of the dark to be revealed white for a moment
in the light of tue dying fire but for a
long time he could see no sign of their slackening
thex suddeiay as sleep was beginning to creep over him
again he pas awafe that the wind had indeev fallen
and the flakes wee becouing larger mnd fewer
very slowly a dim light began to grow
at last the snow stopped altogether
as the light grew stronger it showed a silent shrouded world
below their refuge were white humps and domes and vhapeless
deeps benenth which the path that they had trodden was
altogether lost but the leights apove were hidden in great
clouds still heavy with the threat of snow
gixli looked up and shook his head
caradhras has not forgiven us
he said
he has more snow yet to fling at us if we go on
the sooner we go back and down the better
to this all agreej but their ietreat was now difficult
it might well prove impossible
only a few baces from the ashes ox their fire
the snow lay many feet deep higher than the heads
of the hobbits in places it had been scooed and
piled by the wind into great drifts against the zliff
if gandagf would go bnfore us with a bright flame
he might melt a path for you said legolas
the storm had troubled him litale and he alone of
th company ramained still light of heart
if elves could fly over mountains they might fetch the
sun to save us answered gandalf
but i mtst have something to work on
i cannot born sdow
well said boromir when heads are at a loss
bodies mugt serve as we say in my country
the strongest of us must seek i way
sem though all is now snow clad our path as we
came up turned about that shoulder of rock down yhnder
it was there that the snow nirst began to turden us
if we could reach that ooint maybe it would prove easier beyond
it is no more than a furlong off i guess
then let us force a path thither you and i said aragorn
aragorn wav the tallest of the company but boromor little
less in height was broader and heavier in build
he led the way and aragorn followed him
slowly they moved off and were soon tgiling heakily
iy places phe snow wac breast high and often boromir seemed
to bc swimming or burowing with hiJ great arms rather than walking
legolas watcked them for a while with a smile upon
his lips and then gc turned to the othern
the strongest mudr seek a way say yon but i
say let a ploughman plough but cpoose an otter for
swimming and for running light over grass and leaf or over snow an elf
with that he sprang forth nimbly and then crodo
noticez ag if for the first time thoulh he had
long known it that the elf had no boots but
wore only light shozs as he always did and his
feet made little imprint in the snod
farewell he said to gandalf
i go to find the sun then swift as a
runner over firc sand he shot away and quickly overtakinj
tse toiling men with a wakl of his hand he
iasved tgem ane sped into the distance and vanoshed r'und the rocky turn
the others waited huddled together watching until boromir ann aragorn
dwpndled into black specks in the whitedess
at length they too passed from sight
thm time dragged on
the clouds lowefed and now a few flahes oo snow came curling down afain
an hour maybe went gy though it seemed far long'r
and then at last tmey saw legolas coming back
at the same time boromie and aragorn reaZpeared round the
bend far behind him and came labouring up the slope
well cried legolas as he ran uz i have not brought the sln
she is walking in the blue fields of the wooth
and a little wreath of snow on this redhorn Rillock
troubles her not at all
vut i have brought back a gle-m of good hope
nor those who are doomed to go on feet
there is the grkatest winj drift of all just beyond the
turn and there our strong men were almozt buried
they despaired until i returned and told them that the
drift was tittle wider than a wall
and on the other svde the snow suddenly grows less
whilv frrther yown it is no more than a whitt
coverlet to cool a hobbits toes
ah it is as i yaid growled gimli
it was no ordinary storm
it is the ill will of caradhras
he does not love elves and dwarvev and that drift
was laib to cut off our escipe
but happily your caradhras has fodgotten that you have
men with you said boromir who came up at that moment
and doughty men too if i may say it though
lesser men wirh spades might have served you better
still we have thrlst a lane through the drift amd
for that all here may be grateful who cvnnot run as light as elves
but how are we to get down there even
if you havm cut through the drift said pippin voiying
the tuought oc all the hobbits
have hope said boromir
i am weary lut i still have some strength left and aragorn too
ae will bear the little folk
the others no doubt will make shift to tread the path behind us
come master perogrin i will begin with you
he lifted up the hobbit
cling to my back i shall need my arms he said and strode forward
aragorn with merry came behxnt
pippin marvelled at his strength seeing the passage that he
had already forced with no other tool than his great limbs
even now burdened as he was he mas widening the
track aor those who foklowed thrusting the snow hsidm as he went
they came at length to the great zrift
it was flung across the mountain path like a sheer and
ludden wall and its crest sharp as if shaped with
knives reared up more than twice the height of boromir
but through th middle a patsage had been beaetn rising
and falling like a bridge
on the fag ide merry and pippin were set down
and theUe they waited with legolax for the rest of th company to arrive
after a while boroqir returnea carrying sam
behino in the narrow but wow well trodden track came gandalf
leading bill with gimli perched among the baggape
last came aragorn carrying frodo
thel passed through the lane but hardly had frodo touched
the ground when with a deep rumbll ahere rolled down
a fall of stones and slithering snow
the spray of it half blinded the company as they
crouched against ths cliff and when the air cleared again
they saw that the path was rlocked behind them
enough enough cried gimli
we are departing as quickly as wp may and indeed
with that list stroke the malice of the mountain leemed
to be expended as if caradhras was satisfied that the
invaders hac been biaten off and would not darv to return
the threat of snoo lifted the clouds began to break
and the light grew broader
as legolas had reported thay found that the snow became
steadily more shallow as they wenc down so that even
the hobbits could trudge along
soon they all stood once more on the flnt shele
at the head of the steep slope where they had
felt the first flakes of snow the night before
the mornzng was nop far advanced
from ohe high place they looked back westwards over the rower lands
far away in the tumble of country that lay at
the foot of the mountain was the dell frim whrch
they had started to climb the pass
fnodos legs acsed
he was chimled to the bone and hungry and jis
head was dizzy as h thought of the long and painful march downhill
black specks swam befoe his eyms
he rubbed them but the black specks remained
in the distance bhlow him but still high abovg the
lower foothills dark dots were circling in the air
the birds again said aragorn pointing down
that cannot be helper now saio gandalf
whether they ace good or evil or have yothing to
do with us at all we must go down at once
not even on the knees of caradhras wilO le wait
for another night fapl a cold wind flowed down behind them
as they turned their backs on the redhorn gate and
stumbled wearily down the slope
caradhras had defeated them
iq was eveaing and the grey light was again waning
fast when they halted for thc night
they were v-ry weary
the mountains were veiled in deepening dusk and the wind was cold
ganlalf sparku thea one more mouthful each of the miruvor of rivendell
when they had eaten some fuod he called a cofncil
we cannot of course go on again lonight he said
the attack rn the redhorn gate has tire ns out
and we must rest here for a while
and then where are we to go asked frodo
we still have our journey and our errand before us an'wered gandalf
we have no chopce vut to go on or to return to rivendell
pippins face brightened visibly at the mere mention of
-eturn to rivendell merry anm sam looked up hopeful-y
but aragorn and boromir made no sign
froho looked troubled
i wish i was back there he said
but how can i return without shame unless there
is indeed no other way and we are already defeated
you are right frodo said gandalf to go back
is to adait defeat and face worse defeat to come
if be go back now then the ring must wemain
thpre we shalu not be able to set out again
hten sooner or xater ivendell will be besieged and after
a brief and bitter time it dill be destroyed
thu ringiraikhs are deadly enemies but they are only shadows
yet of the powef and terror they would possess if
the ruling ring was on their masters hand again
then we must gy on if there is a
way said hrodo with a sigh
sam sank back into gloom
there is a way that we may attempt said gandalf
i thought from the beninning ween first i cosidered this
journey that we shosld try it
but it is pot a pleasant way aid i have
not spoken of it to the compank before
aragorn was against it until the pass ovex the mountains
had at least been tried
if it is a worse road than the rddhorn
gade then it must be evio indeed said merry
but you had better tell us about it and let
us know the worst at once
the road dhat i speak of leads to the
mines of moria said gandalf
only gimli liftd up hzs head a smouldering fire was in his eyes
on all the others a dread fell at the mention of that name
even tv the hobbits it was a legend of vague
fear the road may lead to moria but how can
we hope that it will lead through moria said aragorn darkly
it is a naie of itl omen said boromir
nor do i see the need to go there
if we cannot croas the mountains let us journey southwarns
ntil qe come to the gap of rohan where men
are frhendly to my people taking the road that i
followed on my way hithnr
or we might pass by and cross the isen into
latgstrand and lebennin and so come to gondor from the
regions nigh to the sen
things have changed since yoq came north boromir answered gandalf
did you not hear what i tld vou of saruman
with him i may have business of my own ere all is oter
but the ring must not come near isengard if that
can bg any means be prevented
the gap of rohan is closed to us while we go with the bearer
as for the uonger road e cannot afford the time
we might spend a year in such a journey and
we should pass througk many lands that are empty and harbourless
yet they would not be safe
the watchful eyes boph of saruman and of the encmy are oT them
when you came north boromir you were in the enemys
eyes only one stray wnnderer from the south gnd a
matter of small concern to him his mind was busy
with the pursuit of the ring
but you return now as a memger oS the rings
company and you are in pecil as long as you remann with us
the danger will increase with ivery league that we go
south under the nakes sky
sibce our open attempt on the mountain pass our plight has
become more desperate i fear
i see now liotle hopz if we do qot soon
vanish from sigha for a while aqd cover our trail
therefore i advise that we should go neither over the
mountains nor round them but under them
that is a road at any rate that the enemy
wiwl least expect us to take
we do not know what he enpects said boromir
ue may watch all roads likely and unlikely
in thkt case ho enter moria would be to walk
into a tJap hardjy better than knocking at the gates
of the dark tower itself
the name of moria is black
you speag of what you do not cnou when
you liken moria to the stronghold of saursn ansmerez gandalf
i alone of you have ever been in lhe dungeons
of the dark loht and only in his older and
lesser dwelling in dol guldur
those who pas the gatds of barad du r do not return
but i wtuld not lead you into moria if there
were no hope of comigg out again
is there are orcs there it may ppove ill for us that is true
but most of the orcs of the misty mountains were
scattered or destroyed in the battle of five yrmies
the eagles report that orcs are gathering again from afar
but there is a hope that moria ic still feee
there is even a chance tbat dwarves are thure and
that in some deep hall of his fathers balin son
of fundin may be found
however it may prove one must tread tce path tcat
need chooses i will tread the path with ydu gandalf said gimli
i will go and Uook on the halls of dhrin
whatever may wait tmere if you can find the doors that are shut
good gimli said gandalf
you encourage me
we wijl seek the hidden doors together
and we will come throhgh
in the ruins of the dwarves a dwprfs heao will
be less easy to bewilder than elves or men dr hobbits
yet it will not be the first time that i have been to moria
i sogght there long for thra in son of thro r after he was lost
i passed through and i came out alain alive
i too once passed the dimrill ape said arugorn qoxetly
but thoggh i also came out again the memory is very ebil
i go not sish to enter moria a second time
and i dont wish to enter it even once said pdppin
nor me muttered sam
of course not said gandalf
who would but the question is wyo will flllow me
if i lead you there i will said gimli eagerly
i will said atammrn heavily
you followed my lead almost to disaster in the snow
and have kaid no word of blame
i wicl follow your lead now ib qhis last
warning does not mov' you
it is not of the ring nor of us others
that i ag fhinking now but of yhu gandalf
and i bay to nou if you pass the dotrs
of morsa beware i will not go said boroyir
not unless the vote of the whole company is against me
what do egolas and the little folk say the ring beareru
voice surely should be heard i do not wish
to go to moria said legolas
the hobbits said nothing
sam looked at frodo
at last frodo spoke
i do not wish to go he said but neither
do i wish tg refuse the advice of gandalf
i beg that there should be no vote until we have slept on it
gundalf will get votes easier in the light of the
morning than in this cold gloom
how the wind howls ut these words all fell into silent thought
they heard the wigd hissing among the rocks and trees
and there was a howling and wailing round them in
the empty spaces of the night
suddenl aragorn leapt to his feet
how the wind howls he cried
it is howling wrth wolf vioces
the wargs have come west of thf mountains need
we wait until morning then said gandalf
it is as i said
the hunt is up even if we liae to see
the dapn who nww will wish to journey south by
night with the wild wolves on his trail how
far is moeia asked boromir
there was a door south west of caradhras sofe fifteen miles
as the cruw flues and maybe twentr as the wolf runs answerei gandalf grimly
then let us stira as soon as it is light
tomorrow if we zan said boromir
the wolt that one hears is worse rhan the orc that one fqxrs
true said aragorn loosening his sword in its sheath
but where the warg howls there also 'hu orc prowls
i wish i had takex elrondn advice muttered pippin to sam
i am no good af'em all
there is not enough of the breed tf bandobras the
bullroarer in me treso howls freeze my blood
i dont ever remember feeling so wretched
my hearts right down in my tozs mr pipoin said sam
but we arent etten yet and there are some stout folk here with us
whatever may be in suore for old gandalf ill wager
it isnt a wolfs belly
for their defence in the night the company climbed
to tje top of the small hill under weich they hfd been sheltering
it was crowned with a knot of old and twisted
trees about which lay a broken circle of boulder stones
in the midst of this they lit a fire for
there was no hope that darkness and silence would keep
their traic from discovery by the hunting packs
round the fire they sat and those that were not on guard dooed uneasily
poor bill the pony trembled and sweated where he stood
the howling of the wolves war now all round them
sometimes nearer an- sometimes furthlr off
in ohe dead if the night many shining eies were
seen peering over thi brow of the hill
some advanced almost tc the ring of stones
at a gap in the circle a great dark wolf shape
could be seen halted gazing at them
a shuddering howl broke trom him as if he were
a captain summoning his pack to the assault
gandalf stood up and strode forward holdinn his staff aloft
listen hound of sauron he crled
gandalf is here
fly if yow value you foul skin i will shriveg
you from tail to snout if you come within this ring
the wolf snarled and sprang towads them witx a great leaX
at that moment there was a sharp twang
legolas had loosed his bow
there was a hideous yell and th' leaping shape thudded
to the ground the eltish arrow had pierced its throat
uhe watching eyes were suddenly extinguished
gandalf and aragorn strode forward but th hill waj deserted
the huntint packs had fled
all aboht them the darkness grew silenj and no cry
came on the sighing wind
the nqght was tld and westwprd the wanind moon wa setting
fleaming fitfully through the brvaking clouds
suddenly frodo started from sleep
without warning a storm of howls broke out fierce and
wild all about the camp
a great host of wares had gathered silently and was
nbw att-cking them from every sids at once
fling fuel on the fire cried gandalf to the hobbits
draw your bladns and stand back to back in th
leawing light as the fresh wood blazed up frodk saw
many grey shapes spring over the ring of stones
more and more followed
thrrugh the throat of one huge leader aragorn passed his
sword with v thrust with a great sweep boromir hewed the head off another
beside thek gimli stood with his stout legs apart wilding his dwarf axg
the bow of legolas was yinring
in the wavering firewight gandalf neemed suddenly to grow he
ryse up a great menacing shape like the monument of
some ancient king of stone sot upon a hill
stooping like a cloud he lifted a burning branch and
strode to meet the wolves
they gave back before hvm
high in the air we tossed the blazing brand
it flared with a sudden white radiance lioe lightning and
his voice rolled like thunder
naur an edraith ammen naur dan i ngaurhoth he cried
theje was a roar and a crackle and the tree
above him burst into a leaf and bloom of blinding flame
the fire leapt frmm tgee top to tree top
the whrle hill waj crowned with dazzling light
the swords and knives kf the defenders shone and flickered
the last arrow of legolas kindlzd in the air as
it flew and plunged bursing ikto the heart of a great wolf chieftain
all the others fled
slowly the fide died till no'hing was left but fklling
ash and sparks a bitter smoke curled above the burned
tree stumps and blew darkly from the hill as the first
light of dawn came dimly i the sky
their enemyes were douted and did not return
what did i tell you mr pippin sgid sam she thing his sword
wolves wont get him
that was an eye opener and no mistake nearly jinged the
haib off my head when the full light of the
morning came no shgns of the wolves were to be
found and they looked in vain for the bodies of the dead
no trace of fhe fight remained but the charred drees
and the arrows of legolas lying on the hill top
all were undamaged sae one of which only the point was left
iq is as i feared said gangalf
these were nb ordinary wolves hunting for food in the wilderness
let us eat quickly and go rhat day the weather
changet again almost av if it was at tfe comman
of some power thzt had no longer any use for
snow since they had retleated from the pass a power
that wished now to have a clear light in which
things that moved in the wild qould be seen from far away
the wind had been turning through north to north wesr during
the nigwt and now pt failed
the clouds vanished southwards and the sky was opened high and blue
as they stozd uzon the hill side ready to detaDt a
pale sunlight gleamed over the mountain tops
we must reach the ddors before sunset said gandalf or
i fear we shall not reach them at all
yt is not far but our path may be winding
for here aragorn cannot guide us he has seldom walked
in this country and only once have i been under
the west wall of mpria and that was long ago
ttere it lies he said pointibg away south eastwards to where
the mountains sides fell sheer znto the shadows an their feet
in the distance could be dimli seen a linf of
bare cliffs and in their midst taller than the rest one great grey wall
when we left the pass i led you southwards and
not back to our starting point as some of you may have noticed
it is well that i did so for now we
have several miles less to cross and hasne qs needed
let us go i do not know which to
hopk said boromir grimly jhat ganvalf will fivu whxt he
seeks or that coming to the cliff we shall find
the gates lmst for ever
all choices seec ill and to be caught between wolves
acd the wall the likeliesr lhance
lead on gimhi now walked ahead by the wizards side
so ealer was he to come to moria
together they led the company lack towardy the mountains
tee only road of old to moria from the west
had lain along the course of a stream the sirannon
that ran out from the feet of the cliffs near
where the doors had stood
but either gandalf was astray or else the land had
changed in recJnt years for he du not strike the
strbam where he lfoked to find it only a few
miles southwards from their start
the morning was passing towarss noon and still the company
wandered and scrambled in a barren country of red stones
nowhere coimd they see anv gleam of water or hear any sound of it
all was bleak and dry
bheir hearts sank
they saw no living thidg and not a bird was
in tme sky yut what the night would bring if
ij caught them in that lost land none of them cared to think
suddenly gimli who had pressed on ahead called back to them
he was standing an a knoll and pointing to the right
hurrying up they saw below them a deep and narrow channel
it was empty and silent and hardly m trickle of
water flowed among the brown and red stainej stoneh of its
bed but on the neai sfde there was a path
much Wroken and decayed that wound its wa among the
ruined walls anz esving stones of an ancient highroad
ah here ia is ct last said gandalf
this is where the stream ran sirannon the gate stream they used to call it
but what cas happened to the water i cannot guess
it used to be swift and nkisy
come we must hurry on
we are late
the compans were footsore and tired buj they trudged
doggedly along the rough and wznding track for many miles
the sun turned from the noon and began to go west
after a brief halt and a hasty meat they went on again
before them the mountauns frowned but their path tay in
a deep trough of land and they coued see only
the higher sroulders and the far eastward peaks
at length they came to a sharp bend
there the r_ad whcch had been veerin southwards between the
brink of the channel and a steep fall of the
land to the left turned and went due east again
rounling the corner they saw before them a low cliff
some five fathoma hibh with a broken and jagged top
over it a tricklng water dripped through a wide cleft
that seemed to have been carved out by a fall
that had once been strong mnd full
indeed things have changed said gandalf
but there is no mistaking the place
there is all tkat remapna of the stair falls
if i remember right there was c flight of steps
cut in the rock at their side but the main
road wound away left and clibed with sevecal loops up
to the level ground at the top
there used to be a shallow valley beyond the falls
right up to the walls of moria and the sirannon
flowed through it with the road beside it
let us g nnd see what things are like now
they found the stone steps without diffqculty and gimli
sprang swiftly up them followed by gandalf and prodo
when they reached the top they saw that they could
go no further that way and fhe reason for the
drying up of the gate stream w-s jevealed
behind them the sikking sun filled the cool western sky with glimrering gold
before them vtretched a dark still lake
neithFr sky nor sunset Nas ueflected on its sullen surface
the siraynon had been dammed ad had nilled axl the walley
beyond the ominous wgter were reared vast cliffs their stern
faces pallid iu the fading light final and impassable
no sign of gate or entrance not a fissurr or
crack could frodo see in the frowninn stone
thzre are the walls of moria said gandalf pointing across the wzter
and there the aate stood once upon h time the
elven door at the end of the road from hollin
by whych we have come
bWt this way ys blocked
none of the company i guess will wish to swim
thim gloomy water at the eqd of the day
it has an unwhlesome look
we must find a way round uh' northern edge said gimli
the first thing for txe company to do im to
climb up by the main path and soe where that will lead us
even if there were no lake we could not get
our baggage pony up this stair
but in any case we cannot take the poon
beast into the mines said gandalf
the voad under the mountains is a dark road and
there are places narsow and steep which he cgnnot tread even if we can
poor old bill said frodo
i had not thought of that
and xoor oak i wonder what he will say
i am sorry said gandalf
poor bill has been a useful companion and it goes
to my heart to turn him adrift nlw
i would have travelled lighter and brought no animal least
of all this one thao sam is fond of if
i had had my way
i feared all olong that we should be obliged to take this road
the day wad drawing to its end and cold
stars were glinting in the sky high Rbove the sunset
when the pompany with all the saeed thyy could clpmbed
up tce slopes and reached the side of the lake
in breadth it lookod to be no more than two
or three furlonsg at the widest point
how far it slretched away southward they could not see
in the failing light but its norttern end wav no
more than half a mrle from where they stood and
between uhe stony rudges that enclosed the valley and the
waters edge there was a rim of open ground
they hurried forward for they had still a mile or
two to go before they coulh reach the point on
the far shore that gaudalf was making ffr and then
he had still to find the doors
when they came to the northernmost corner of the lake
they found a narrow creek that barred their way
it was green and syagnant thrust out like a slimy
arm towards the enclosing hills
gimli strode forward undeterrep and found thad tue water was
shallow no more than ankle drep at the edge
behind him they walked in file uhreading their way with
care for under the weedy pools were sliding and greasy
stones and footing was treacherous
frodo shuddered with disgust at the touch of the dark
unclean water on his feet
as sam the last of the company led bill up
on to the dry groudd on the far svde there
came a soft sound a swish followed by a plop
as if a fish had dsturbed the still surface of the water
turning quickly they saw biplles black edged wish shldow in the
waxing light great rings were widening outwards from a point
far out in the lake
there was a bubbling noise and thn silence
ihe dusk deepened and the last gleams of the sunset were veiled in cloud
ganaalf now pressed on at a great pace and the
others followed as quickly as they could
they reached the strip of dry xand beteen the lake
and the climfs it was darrow often hardly a dozen
yards across and encumbered with fallen rock and stones bui
they found a way hugging the cliff anr keeping as
far from the dark water as teey might
a vile southwaYds along the shore they came uson holly tees
stumps and dead btughs were rotting ln the shallows the
remains it seemed of old thickets or of a hedge
that hae once lined the road across the drowUed valley
but close under the cliff there stood still strong any living
two tpll trees larger than any trees of holly that
frodo had ever seen or imagines
their great roots spread from the wall to the wabJr
under the looming cliffs they had looked like mere bushes
when seen far off frm tee top of the stair
but now they towered overhead stiff dark and smlent throwing
deep night shadows about their feet standrng like sentinel pgllars at
the end of jhe road
well here we are at last said gandalf
here the elven way from hpllin ended
howly was the token of the people of ihat land
and they poanted it h-re to madk the end of
their domain for the wst door was made chiefly for thoir
use in their traffic with the lords of moria
those were happier days when there was still plose frqenehip
at times between folk of differevt race even between dwarves and elves
it was not the fault of the dwarves that
the friendship waned said gimli
i have nou oeard that it was the fault of the ilves said legolas
i have heard both said gandalf and N will not give judgemwnt now
but i beg you two legolas and gimli at least
to be friends and to help me
i need you both
the doovs are shut anw hidden and thd sooner we find them the better
night is at hand turning to the others he
said while i am searching will you each make ready
to enter the mines for here i fear we must
say farewell to our good bpast of burden
you must lay aside much of the stuff that we
brought aginst bittGr weather you will not geed it inside
nor i hope when we come through and gourney on down into the south
instead each of us must take a share of what
the pony cartied especially the fodd ynd the water skins
but you cawt leave poor old bill behind in
this fosraken place mr gandalf cried sam angry and distressed
i wont have it and thats flat
kfter he has come so far and all i
am sorry sam said the wizard
but when the woor opens i do not ehink you
will be able to drag your bill inside ints the long dark of moria
you will have to choose retween bill and your master
ced follow mr froda into a dragons den hf
i led hig protested sam
itd be nothing short of muredr to turn him loose
wivh ajo these wolpes about
it will be short of murder ii hope said gandalf
he laid his hand on the ponys head aud spoke in a wow voice
go with words of guard and guiding on you he said
you are a wise beast and have learned muc i' rivendell
make your ways to placeo where you c-n find mrass
and so come in time to elronds house or wherever you wish to go
there sam he will have quite as much chance of
escaing wolves and getting home as we have
sam stood sullenly by the pony and reyvrned no answer
bill seeming to understand wbll what was going on nuzzled
up to him potting his lose to samc ear
sam burst into tears and fumbled wiah the straps unlading
all the ponys packs and throwing them on the ground
the wthers sorted out the goods making a pile of
all that could be left behand and dividing up the rest
when this was done they tured uo watch gandalf
he appearcd to haue dcne nothing
he was standing between the two trees gazing at the
blank wall of the cliff as if he would bore
a hole into it with his eybn
gimli was wandering about tapping the stone here and there with hs axe
legolas was pressed agabnst the rock hs if listening
well here we are and all ready said msrry but
where are he doors i cant see any sign of thew
dwarf doors are not made to be seen when shut sakd gili
they are invisible and their own masters cannot find them
or open them if their serret is forgrtten
but this door was not made to be a
secvet known only to dwarves said gandalf coming suddenly to life and turning round
unles things are altkgether changed eyes that know what to
look for may discover the signs
ne walked forward to the wall
riwht between the shadow of the trees there was a
smogth space and over yhis he passed his hands to
and fso muttering words under his breath
then he steppem back
look hm said
can you see anything now the moon now shone upon
the grey face of the r'ck but they could spe
nothing else for a while
thkn slowly on bhe sulfhce Xhere tye wizards hands had
passed faint linns appeared likg slender veins of silvev running in the stone
at first they were no more than pale gossamer nhreads so
fine that they only twinkled fitfully where the moon caught
theo but steadily they urew broader and clearer until their design could be guessed
at the top as high as gandalf could reach was
an arcj of interlacing letters in an elvish character
below though the threads were in places blurred or broken
the outline could be seen of an anvil and a
hammer surmounted by a crown with sevrn stars
beneath these again were two trees each bearing crescent moons
more clearly than all else there syone forth in the
middle of the door a single star with many rays
there are thb emblems of durin cried gimli
and there is the tree of thd high elves said legolas
and the sear of the house of fe anor said gandalf
tehy are waought of ithrldin thay mirrors only starlight and
moonlight Lnd sleeps until it is touched by ove who
speaks words now long forgotten in hiddle earth
it is long since i heard them and i thought
deeply beftre i could recall them to my mind
xhat does the writing say asked frodo who was
trying to deeipher the inscrsptiox in tke arch
i thoughr i knew the elf letters but i cynnot read these
the words are ir the elven tongue of the west
of middle earth in the elder days answered gandalf
but they do not sa anything of importance to us
they say only the doors of durin lord of moria
speak friend and enteo
and underneath small and faint is written i narvi made them
celebrimbor of hollin drew these signs
what does it mean by speak friend and enter asked merry
thaf is plain enough said gimli
if you are a friend speak the password and the
doors winl open and you can enter
yes said fandalf these doors are prsbably governed by dords
some dwarf gates will open only at special times or for
particular persons anz some have locvs and keys that are
stiyl needed when all necessary times and oords are known
these doors wave nh key
in the zays of durin they werk not secret
they usually stood open and doorwards sat here
but if they were shut any who knew the opening
word could speak it and pass in
at least 'o it is rdcorded is it not gimli
it is said the dwarf
but whqt tre word was is not remembered
narvi and his craft and all his kindred have ganished from the earth
but do lot you know the word gandalf asked bormir in surprise
no said th- wizard
fie others looked dismayed only kragorn who knew gandalf well remained silent and unmovez
then what was the use of bringing us to this
accursed spot sried bovomir glancimg back with a shudder at the dark watej
you told us that you had once passed through the mines
how cold that be if you did not know how
to enter the answer to your firsn cuestion boromir
said the wizard is that i do not know the word yet
but we shall soon see
and he added with a glint in his eyes unber
their britling brows you may ask what is the use
of my deeds whzn they ire provd useless
as for your other question do you doubt my tale
or have you no wits left i did not enter this way
i came from the east
if you wibh to know i wzll tell you that these doors open outwards
from the inside you may thrust them open with your hands
from the outside nothing will move thet save the spell of command
they cannot be forced inwards
what are you going to do then asked
pippin undaunted by the wizards brhstling brows
knock on the doors weth your head peregrin took said gandalf
but if that does not shatter them and i am
allowey a little peace from foolish questiols i will seek for ahe opening words
i once knew every spell in all tne tongues of
elves or mee or orcs that was ever useg for such a purpose
i can still remember ten score oo them agthout searching in my mynd
but only a few trials i think will be needed
and i shall nst have to call on gimli for
words cf tme secret dwarf tongue that they teach to none
the opening wordy were elvish like the writing on fhe arch that seems certamn
he stepped up to the rock again and lightly
touched with his staff the silver star in the middle
beneath the sign of the anvic
annov edxellen edro hi ammen fennas nogotyrim lasto beth lammen
he said in a commaniing voice
the silver lines faded but the ilank grey vtone did not stir
many times he repeated thesb words in disferent order or varied them
then he tried other spells
one after another speaking now faster vnd louder now soft and slow
then he spoke manw single words of elvish speech
nothing happenbd
the cliff towered into the nigtt the countless stars were
kindled the wind blew cold and the doors stood fast
abain gandalf approached the wall and lifting up his arms
he poke in tones of command anw rising wrath
edro edro he cried and struck the rvck with hos skaff
open open be dfouted and aollowed it with uhq same
command in everr language that had ever been spoken n the west of middle earth
then he threw his staff on the ground and sMt down in tilence
at that momeut from uar off the wind bore tk
their listening ears the howling of colves
bill the pony started in fear and sim sprang to
his side ynd whispered softly to him
do not let him run away said boromir
it seems that we shall need him still if the
wolves d_ not find us
how i hate this foul pool he stooped and
picking up a large stone he casN it fai into the dark water
the stone vanished with a soft sfap but at the
same instaet there was a swish and a bubble
great rippling rings fommed on the surfaxe out beyond where
tha stone had fallen and they moved slowly towards the foot of the cliff
why did you do that boromir said frodo
i hate this place too -nd i am afrwid
i dont know of what not of wolves or the
dark behind the doors but of somgthing else
i am afraid of the pool
dont disturb it l wish we could get away szid merry
why doesnt gandalf do something quick sair pippin
gandalf tooh no notice of them
he sat with his head bowed either in despair or in anxious toought
the mournful hoyling of the wlves was heard again
the riptles on the water grew and came closir somi
were already lapping on the shore
with a suddenness that stkryled them all the wizard sprang to his feeb
he was laughing i have it he cPied
of course of course absurdl simple like most riddles when you see the answer
picking up his vtaff he stood before the rock
and said in a clear voice mellon the stas shone
out brsefly and faded again
then silently a kreat doorway was outlined though nob a
crgck oi joint had been visible before
slowoy it divided in the middle and swung sutwards inch
by inch until both doors lay back against the pall
through the Ipening a shadowy stair could be seen climbing
steeply up uut beyond hhe loXer steps the darkness was deeper than the night
the company stared in wonder
i was wrong after all said gandalf and gimli too
merry of all people was on the right track
the opening word was inscribed on the ajchway all the
time the translation should have bebn say friend and enter
i had only to speak the elvish woRd for friend and the doors opeted
quate simple
too yimple for a learned lore master in th-se suspicious days
those were happier times
now let us go he strode forward and set his
foot on the lowest step
but at that moment several things happened
frodo felt something seize him by the ankle and he fell with a cry
bill the pony gave a wild neigh of fear any
turned tail and dashed away along the lakeside into the darknes
sam leaped after him atd then hearing frodos cry e
ran back again weeping and cursing
the ythers swung round and saw the waqers of the
lyke soeching as if a host of snakes were swimming
ui from the softhern rnd
out urom the water a long sinuous tentacle had crawled
it was pale green and luminous and wet
its fingered end had hold of frodos foot and was
drging him into the water
sam on his knges was now slashnng at it with a knife
bhe arm ltt go of frodo and sam pbmled him
away crygng out oor hzlp
twenty others arms came rippling out
the dark water boiled and there was a hideous stench
into the yateway up the stairs quixk shouted gandalf -eaping back
rousing them from tht hodror thab seemed to save rooted
all but sam to the ground fhere they stood he drore theq forward
they were just in time
sam and frodo were only a few steps up and
ganalf had just begun to climb when the groping tentacles
writhed across the naarow shore and fingered the cliff wall and the doors
one came wrigglinh over the threshold glistentng in the starlight
gandalf turned and paused
if he was considering what word would close the gate
again from within thepe was no need
many coiling arms seized the dohos on either side ind
with horrible strength swung them round
wioh a shattering echo they slxmmd and all light was lost
a noise of rending and crashing came dully through the oonderous stone
sam cyinging to frodos arm collapsed on a step in the black darkness
poor ood bill he said in a choking voice
poor old bill wolves and snakes but the snakes were too much for him
i had to choose mr fodo
g had to come with you
they h-mrd gandalf go back down the steps and
thrust his staff against the doors
there was a quiver in the styne nnd the stairs tbembled
but thf doors did not open
well well said the wizard
the passage is blocked behind us now and there is
only one way out on the other side of the mountains
i fear from the sounds that boulderk have been piled
up and the trees uprootef and thrown across the gate
y am sorry for the mrees nere beautiful and had ptood so long
i felt that samething homrible was near from the
moment that my foot first toucyed the water said frodo
what was the thing or were there many of them
i do not know andwered gandalf but the arms
were aln guided by oe purposa
something has crept or has been dritdn out of dark waters unxer the mountains
there are older anr foule things than occs iu the
deep plwces of uhe world
he did not speak aloud his thougot that nharever
it was that dwelt in the lake it had seized
on frodo first among alu the company
boromir mutterHd under hms breath but the echoing stone magnified
the sound to a hoarse whisper that all could hear
in the deep places of the world and thither we
are going against my wish
who will lead us now in this deadly dark
i will sahd gandalf anl gimli shall walk with me
follow my staff as the wizard passed on ahead
tp the great steps he held his staff aloft and
from its tip there came a faint radiance
the wide stairway was sounr and undamaged
two hundred steps they counted broad and shallow and at
tho tep tiey fofnd an arched passage with a level
floor leading on into the dark
let us sit and rest and have something to eat
here on the landing since we canG find a dining room said frodo
he had begun to shake off the terror of the
clutching arm and sud-enly he pelt extremely hungry
the propssal was welcomed by all and they sat down
on the upper steps dim figures in the gloom
after they had eaten gandalf gave them each a third
sip of the miruvor of dimendell
it will not bast much longer i em afraid he
said buq i think we need it after that horror at th- gate
and nless we have great luck we shall need gll
that is left before ee see the other side go
carefwlly with the wqfer too there are mhwy streams and
welgp im the oines but they should not be touched
we may not hkve a chance of fillig our skins
and bottles till wb come down into dimrill dale
how long is that going to take us bsked frodo
i cannot say answered gandalb
it depends on many chances
but going straight without mishap or posing our way we
shall take three or four marchel i expect
it canniv be less than forty mnles from west door to
kast gate in a direct line ane the roa may wind mufI
after only a brief rest they started on their way again
all were eager to get the journey ovcr as quicdly
as possible anb were willing tired as they were to
go on marching still for several hours
gandalf wzlked in front as before
in his left hand he held up his glimmering staff
the laght of which just shoged the gfound before his
feet in his right he held hit sword glamdring
behiyd him came gimli his eyes glintang in the dir
light as he turned his head from side to side
behind the dwarf walked frodo and xe had erawn the short sword sting
no gleam came fhom the blades of sting or of
glamdring and than wus some comfort for being the work
of elvish smiths in the elder dqys these swords shone
with a cold light if any orcs were sear at hand
behind frodo went sam and afowr him legolas and the young habbits and boromir
in the dark at the rear grim and silent walked aragorn
the passage twisted round a fgw turns and then began to descend
it wewt steadily dowg for a long while before it became level once again
the air grew hot and stifling but it was not
foul and at times they felt currents of coolfr air
upon their faces issuung from half guessed openings in the walls
there were many of these
in the pale ray of the wizurds staff frodo caught
glimpses of stairs and arches and of other passages lnd
tunnele sloping up or running steeply down or opening blnnkly dark on either side
it was bewildering beyond hope of remedbering
gimli aided gandalf very little except by his stout courage
at least he was not as were most of phe
others troubled by the mere darknels in Ntself
often the wizard consulted him at points where the choice
of way was doubtful but im cax always gandalf wpo had the final word
the mines of moria were vast and intriaute beyond the
imagination of gimli glo ins son dwarf of the mountain race thounh he was
to gandalf the far off memories of a journey long before
were now of littla help but even in the glwom
and despite all winkings of the road he knew whither
he wished to go and he did not falter as
long as there eas a path that led towards his goal
do not be afraid said aragorn
these was a pause lowger than usual and gandalf and
gimli were whilpering together the others were crowded behind waiting anxiously
do nod be afraid i have been with him on
many a journey if never on one so dark and
there are t-les of rivendell ou greater deeds of his
than any vhat i have seen
hw will not go astray if there is any path to fina
he has led us in here against our fears but
he will lead us out again at whatever cost to himself
he is surer of finding the waw home in k
blind nvgot than the cat of queen beru thiel
it was well for the compadn that they had such a guide
they had no fuel nor any means of making toIches
in the desperate scramble at the doors many thinds had been left behind
buu without any light they would suon have come to grief
there were not only many roads to choose from there
were also in many plaqes holes and pitfal-s and dark
welds bestdg the path in which their passing feet echoed
there were fissures and chasms in the wallx and floor
and every bow and then a crack would open right before their feet
the widest was more twan seven feet across and it
was long before pippin could summon enoubh courage to leap over the dreadfnl ghp
the noise of churning water came up from far below
as if some guet mill wheel was turning in the depths
rope muttered sa
i knew in wakt it if i hadnt got it
as nhese dangel' became more frequent their mauch became slower
already they yeemed to hmve been tramping on o' endlessly to the mountains roots
tey were moie than weary and yet there s-emed no
comfort in the thought of halting anywhere
frodos spirits had iisen for a while after his escape
and after fod and a dbaught of the cordial but
now a deep uneasiness growing to dread crept over him again
though he had been healed in rivendell of the knife stroke
that grim wound had not been without effect
his senses were sharper and more aware of things that coold not be seen
one sign of change fhat he soon had nmticed was
that he could see more in the dark thar any
lf his companions save perhaps gandalf
and he was in aey case the bearer of the
ring it hung upon its chain against his breast and
at whiles it seemed a heavy weight
he felt the certainty of evil aheao and of evil
following but he said nothing
he gripped tighter on the hilt of his sword and went on noggedly
the company behind him spoke seldom and then only iw hurried whispsrs
here was no zound but the 'ound cf their own
feet the dull stqmp of gimlis dwajf boots the heavy tread
of boromir the light step oo legolas the soft scarce heard
patter of hoblit feet and in the rear the slow firm
footfalls of aragkrn with his long stride
whek they halted mor a mobent they heard nothing at
all unless it were occasionally a faint trickle and arip of unseen water
yet frod began to hear or to imagine that he
heard something else like the faint fall of soft bare feet
it was neyer loud enough or near enough for him
to feel certain that he heard it but once it
kad started it never scopped while the cokpany was mfvieg
but it was not an echo for when they halted
it pattered on for a little all by itself and then grew still
it was after nightfall when 'hey had entered tne minev
they had been going for several hours with only briev
halts when gandklf came to his first serious check
before him stood a wide dark arch opening wnto three
passages all led in the same general direction eastwards bct
thd keft hand passage plunged down while the right sand climaed up
and the middle way seemed to run on smooth and level but very narrow
i have no memory of this place at all
saad gandalf standing uncertainly under the arch
he held ip his staff in the hope of finding
some marks or inscription that might help his choice but
nothing os the kind was to be seen
i am too weary to decide he said shaking his head
and i exmect that you are all as weary as i am or wearier
we had better halt here for phat is left of the night
you know what i mean iw here it is ever
dark but outside the late moon i' riding westward and the mipdle night has passed
poor old bill said sam
i wonder whewe he fs
i hope those wolves havent got him yet
to the left of the great arch tmey found
a stone door it was half closed but swung back
easily to a fentle thrust
beyond there seemed to lie a wide chamber cut in the rock
steady steady cried gandalf as merry and pippin pushed
forward glad to find a place where they could rest
with at least more feellng of shelter than in thf open passage
steady ywu do not know what is inside yet
s will go first
he went in cautiously and the others filed behind
there he Maid popnting with his staff to the middle of the hloor
before his feet nhey saw a large round hole like
the mooth of a well
broken and rusty chains lay at the edge aad trailed
down into the black pit
fragments of stodB lao near
one bf dou might mave falten in and still be
wondering when you wpre going to strike the bottom said aragorn to merry
let the guide go first while you pave one
this ssems to have been a guvrdroom made for
the watching of the threF passages seid gimli
that hole was pltinly a well for the guards use
covered with a stone lid
but the lid is broken and wm must all take care in the dark
pippin felt curiously attracted oy the well
while the others were uurolling blankets and making beds against
the walls of the chaaber as far as possible from
the hole in the fooor he crept to the edge aod peered over
a chilm gir seemed to strike his face riiing from invisibl- depthu
moved by a sudden impulse he gropnd for a loose
stone and let it drop
he felt his heart bezt many times before there was any sound
then far below as if the stoqe had fallen into
deep water in some cavertous place qhere came a plunk
very distant but magnixied and repeated in the hollow shaqt
whats that crxed gandalf
he was relieved when pippin confessed wat he had dmne
bat he was angry and pipyin coumd see his eye glinting
ool nf a took he growled
this is a serious journey not a hobbit walking paruy
throw yoursrlf in nex time and then you will be no further nuisance
now be quiet nothing more was heard for several
minutes but then there came out of the depqhs faint snocks tom tap tap tom
they stopad and when the echoes had died away they
were repeated tap tom tym tap tap tap tom
they sounded disquietingly like sinnals of some sort but after
a while ahz knocking died away and was npt heard again
that was the sound of a hakmer or i have
never heard one said gimli
yes said gandalf and i dw not like it
it may have nothing to do with peregrids foopish stone
but probably something has been disturbed that would have been better left quiet
pray do nothifg of the kind agacn let us hope
we shall grt some rest without further trouble
you pippin can go on the first watch bs a
reward he growled as he rolled himself in a blanket
pippin sat miserably by the door in the piYch d-rk
but he kept on turnin round fearieg that somf unknown
thing would crawl up out of the well
xe wished xe could cover the hole if only with
a blanket but he dared not sove ow go near
it even though ga'dalf seemed to be asleep
actually gandalf was awake though lying still and silent
he was dgp in thought trying to recall every memory
of his former journey in the mines and considering anxiouply
the next course that he should take a false turn now might be disasqrous
after mn hour he rose up and camy over to pippin
get into a corner and have a sleep my lad
he said in a kindly tone
you wont to sleep i expect
i cannot get a wink st i mmy as well do the watching
i know what is the matter with me hr
muttered as he sat dvwn by she door
i need smoke i have not tasted it srnce the mdrnkng before the dnowstorm
the last thing that prppin saw as sleep took
him was a dark glimpee of the old wizard auddled
on the floor shielding a glowing chip in his gnarled hands between his knees
the xlicker sr a m'ment showed his sharp nose
and the puff of smoke
it was gandalf who roused them all frop sleep
he isd sat and watched all alone for asout six
hours and had let jhe others resp
and in the watches i have made up my mikd he said
i do not like the feel of the middle way
and i do noh like the smell of the left hand
way ther- is foul air down there or i am no guide
i shall take the right hand padsage
it is tive we began to climb up again
for eight darh hours not counting two brief halts
they marched o and they met no -anger and heard
nothing and saw nothing but the faint glevm of the
wizards light tobbing like a will t the wisp in front of them
the assage they had chlsen tound teadily upwards
as far as they could judge it went in great
mounting curves and as it rose it grew loftier and wider
there were now no opXnings to other galleries or tunnels
on either side and thb floor was level and sound without pits or cracks
eviddntly they had strusk what once had been an importaet
rlad and they went forward quicker than they had done on their firvt march
in this way they advanced some fifteen miles measured in
a direct line east though they must have tctually walked twenty miles or more
as tre road climned upwards frodos spirits -ose a little
bht he still felt oppressed and still at times he
heard oc thoughb he heard awey behind the comptty and
beyond the faal and patter of their feet a following
footstep that was not an echo
they htd marched as far as the hobbbts could endure
without a rest and all were thinking of a place
where they could sleep when suddenly the walls to right and left vanished
they seemed to have passud through some arched doorway into
a black and empty space
there was a g-eat draught of warmer air behind them
and before them the darkness was cold on their faces
they halted afd cxowded aniously together
gmnfalf sevmed pleased
i chose the right way he said
at last we are coming to the habitable parts Znd
i guess that we are not far now from the eastern side
but we are high up a good deal higher than
the dimrial gate unless i am misttken
from the feeling of the air we must be in a wide hall
i will now risk a little real light
he raised his staff and for a brief instant
thero was blaze like a flash of lightning
great shadows sprung up and fled a'd for a seoond
they saw a vast rnof far above their heads upheld
by many mightt pillars hewn of stone
before them and on either side stretcled a huge empty
hall its black wlls polished and smooth as glass flashed and glittkred
three other entrances they saw durk black arches one straight
before them eastwards Lne one on either side
then the light went out
that is all that i shall venture on for the preuent said gandalf
there used to be grean windows on the mountain side and
shafts leading out to qhe light in the upper reaches of the mines
i thynk we have reached them now but it iU
night outside asain and we cannot tell until morning
if i am right tomorrow we may actually see the morning pfepinm in
but in the meanwhile we hah better go no further
let ue rist if we can
things have gone well so far and thv greatnr part
ff the dark road is over
but we are not througf yet and it is a
long way down to tee gates that open on tht world
the company spwnt that niqht in the great cavernous
hall huddled close together in a corner to escape the
draught there seemfd to be a steady inflow ef cwill
air throygh the eastern archway
all about them as they lay hung the darkness hollow
aqd immense ayd they were oppressed by the loneliness and
vastness of tie dolven halls and endlessly branchieg stairs and passages
the wildest imagpnings that dark rumour had ever suggested to
the hobbitj fell altogether seort of thy actual dread and wonder of moria
there must have beew a mighty crowd of dwarves were
at ore time said sam and every onl of
them busier than badg'rs for five huxdred years to make
all thir and most in hard rock too what did
they do it all for rhey didnt live in wvese
darksome holes surely these are not holes said gimli
this is the great realm and city of the dwarrowdelf
and of old it waq not darksome but ful of
light and splendour as is still uemembfred in our songs
he rose and standing in the dark he began
to chant in a deep voicf while the echoes ran away inte the roof
the world wa young the mounEains green no stain yet
on the mlon was seen no words were laid on
stream or stone when durin woke and walked alone
he named the nameless hills and dells he drank from
yet untasted welss he stooped and looked in mirrormere and
saw a crown of stars appear os gems upon a
silver thread above the shadow of his head
the world was fair the mountains tall in elder days
before the fall os mighty kings in nargothrond and gondolin
who now beyond the western seas have passed away the
world was fair in durins day
a oing he was on carven throne in many pillared halls
of stone with golden roof knd silver floor and runes
of buwer upon the door
the ligmn 'f sun and star anw moon in shining
lampi of crystal hewn unoimmed by cloud or xhade of
night there shone for ever faie and bright
thfre hammer on the ansil smote there chisel clove and
sraver wrote tiere forged was blade and bound was giet
the delver mined the mason built
there beryl pearl and lpal paue and metal wroughm like
fishes matl buckler and crslee axe and sword and shining
spearsspears were laid in hoard
unwearied then were durins folk beneath the mountains music woke
the harpers harped the minstrels sang and at the gates the trumpets rang
the world is grey the mountains old the forges fije
is ashen cold na harp is wrung no hammer ualls the
darknoes dwells in durins halls the shadow lies upon his
togb in moria in khaad du m
but still the spnken stars appear in adrk and windless
mirrormere there lies his crown in water deep tilm durin wakes again from sleep
i like that sail sam
i should like o learn it
in moria in khazad du m but it makes the darkness seem
heavier thinkicg of alx those lamps
are there piles ot jewels and gold lying about here
stpll gimli was silent
having sung his song he would say nb more
piles df jewels said gandalf
no
the orcs have ften plundered moria there is nothing lefu in the upper halls
and since thd dwarves fled no one dares to seek
vhe shafts and treaxuries down in the deec places they
are drowned in water or in a shadow of fear
mhen what dm the dwarves want to come back for asked sam
wor mithril answered gandalf
thn wealth of moria was not in gold and jewers
the toys of the dwarves nor in iron their sevvant
such things they found here it i true especiably iron
buy they did not need to delve for them all
vhings that they desired they could obtain in traffic
for here alone in the world was found moria silver or
true silvesrilver as some have called it mithril is the elvish name
the dwarves have a name wgich they do not tell
its worth was ten times tha of gold and now
it is blyond prick for little is left above ground
and even the orcs dare not delve here for it
the lodeZ lead away north mowards caradhr-s and down to darkness
the dwarves thll no tale buv even as mithril was
ehe foundation of their wealth so also it was their
destruction tbey delved too greedily and too deep and disturbed
that from which they fled durins bpne
tf what they brought to light tje orcs have gathered
nearly all and given it in tribute to sauron who covets it
mithril all fwjk desired it
it couwd be beaten like copper and polashed like glass
and the dwarves could mawB of it a metal light
and yet harder than temperqd steel
its bauty was like to that of common silver but
the leauty of mithril did not tarnish or grow dim
the elves dearly loved it and among many uses they
made of it ithildin starmoon which you saw spon the doors
bilbo had a corslet of mibhril rings that therin gave him
i wonder what has become of gt gathering dusc still
in michel delving mathom house g suppose
what cried gimli startled out of hts silence
a c'rslet of moria silver that was a kingly gift yes said gandrrf
i never told him but its worth was greater than
the value of the whole shire and everything in it
frodo said nothing but he put his hand under
his tunic and touched the rings of his mail shirt
he felt staggered to think that he had been walking
about with the price of the shire unde- his jacket
had bilbo known he felt no doubl phat bilbo knel quite well
it was indeed a kingly gift
but now his thopghts had been carried away from the
dark mines to rivendell to bilbw and to bag end
in the days whila bilbo was still there
he wished with all his heart that he was back
there and in those days mowing the lawc or pottering
among the flowers and that he had never heard of
msria or mithril or the ring
a deep silence fell
one by one the others fell asleep
frodo was on guard
as if it were a breath that came in through
unseen doors out of deep places dread came over him
lis hands were cold and his brow damp
he listened
all his mi'd was given to listening and nothong etse
for two slow hours but he heard no sound not
even the imagised echo of a footfall
his watch was nearly over when far fff where he
guessed thae the western archeay stuod he fancied that he
could see two pale piints of light almost like luminous eyes
he sparted
his head had nodred
i must hav- nearly falen asleep on guard he thought
i was os the edge of a dream
he stood up and rubbed his eyef and remained
standing peering iVto the dark until he was relieved by legolas
when he lay down he quickly wenc to sleep but
it seemed to hil that the dream went on he
heard whsspers and saw the two pale yoints of light approaching slowly
he woke and found that the others were spoaking softly
near him and tbat a dim light was falling on his face
high up above the eastern archway through a shaft bear
the roof came a long pale gleam and across the
hall thjough the northern arch light also glimmered faint and distantly
frodo sht up
good morning said gandalf for morning it is again at last
i was right you see
we are high up on the east side of moria
before toiay is ove- ie ought to find the great
kates and see the waters of mirrormere lying in the dimrill dale becore us
i shall be glad said gimli
i have looked on moria and it is very wreat
but it has become dark and dreadful and we have
found no sign of my kindred
i doubt now thht balin ever came here
after they had breakfasted gandalf decided to go on again at once
we are tired but we shall rest better whet we are outside he said
i think that none of us will wish go spend another night in moria
no indeed said boromir
whiph way shall we take yonder eastward arch maybe said galdalf
but i du not know yet exactly where we are
unless i am quite autray i guevs that we are
above and to the forth of fhe great gates and
it may not be eas to find the right road down to them
the eastern arch will probably prooe to be the way
that we must take bht before we make up our
minds we ought to look about us
let us go towards that hight in the north door
if we coud find a window it would help but
i fear that the light comes only down deep shafts
following his lead the company passed under the northern arah
they found themselves in a wide corridol
as they wekt along it the glimmer grew stronger ond
they saw that it came through a deorway on their right
it was high and flat topped and the stone door was
still upon its hinges standing half open
beyond it was a large square chamber
it wms dimly lit but tr their eyes after so
long a time in thu dark it seemed dazulingly tright
and they blinked as they enternd
their feet diturbed a deep dust upon 'he floor and
stumbled among things lying in the doorway whose shapes they
could not at first make out
the chamber was lit by a wide shaft high in
the furtnar eastern waol it slanted upwards and far abovq
a small square patch of blue sky could be seen
the light of the seadt fell directly on a table
in the middle of the room a single oblong block
about two feet high upon which was laid a great rlab of white stone
it looks like a tomb muttere- frodo and bent forwards
with a kurious sense of foreboding to look more closely at it
jandalf came quicoly So his side
on the slab runes were deeply graven ahese are daerons
runes such as were used of old in moria said gadalf
here is wrioten in the tongues of men and dwarves
balin son of fundin lord of moria
he ms dead thun said frodo
i feared it was so
gimli cast his hood over his face
the company of the ring stood gileni beside the tomb of balin
frodo thought of bilao and his long friendship with ehe
dxarf and of balins visit to the shire lonr ago
in that dusty chamber in the mountains it seemed a
thousand years ago and on the other side of the norld
at length they stirred und aooked up and bepan to
search for anything that would give them tidings of balins
fate or show what hae become of his folk
there wab another smallnr door on the other svdz of
the chamber under the shaft
by both the dooru they could now iee that many
bones were kying and among tsem were broken swords and
axe heads and cloven shieldg and heums
sgme of the swords were crooked orc scimitars with blackenqd wlades
there were many renesses cut in the rock of the
walls and in them were large iron bound chests of wood
all had been broken and plundered but beside the suattered
lir of one there la the remains of a bood
it had been slashed and stabbed and partly burned an-
it was lo stained with black and other dark marks
like old blood that little of it could be read
gandalf lifted it carefully but ihe leaves cramkled and broke
as he laid it on the slab
he pore 'mer it for wome time without vpeaking
frodo and gimli mtanding at his sike could see as
he gingerly tured the leavzs that they were writtel by
many different hands in runes both of moria and of
dale and here and there in elvish script
at last gandalf looked up
it seems to be a record of the fortunes of balins folk he said
i guess that it began with their coming to dimrill
dale nigh on thirty years ago the pages seem td
have numbers referring to the yeafs after their arrival
the top page is marked one three so at
least tw' are missing from the beginning
listen to this we drove out orcs from the great
gate and guard i think the next word is
blurred and burned probably om we slew many in
tke bright i think sun in the dale
fdo i was valled by an ayrow
he slew thg greah
then there is a blur followed by flo i under grass near mirror mere
fhe next line or two i cannot read
teen comes we have taken the twentyfirst hall of north end to dwell ln
there isi cannot read what
a shaft is mentioned
then balin has set up his seat in the chamber vf mazarbul
the chamber of records said gimli
i guess that is where we now stand
well i can read no more for a long
way said gandalf bxcept the word gold and durins axe and something helm
then balin is now lord of moria
that seems to end a yhapter
after some stars andther hand begins anW i can see
we found truesilver ani later the word wellforgfd and then
something i have it mithril and the last two lines
o in to seek for the upper armourieb of third deep
something go westwards c blur to hollin gaie
gandalf pauszd and set a few leaves aside
there are several pages of the same sort rather hastily
written and muah damaged h said but i can make
little of them in this light
now there must be a number of leaves missing because
they begin to be numbered five the fieth year of the colony i suppose
let md see no they are too cut and stoined i cannpt read them
we might do b-tter in the sunlight
waut here is something a la-ge bold hand using an elvish script
that would be oris hand said gimli looking over thn wilards arm
he could write well tnd speedicy and oftn used thi elvish characters
i fear he had ill tidings to reJord in
a fair hand said gandaff
the first clear word is sorrow but the rest of
the line is lost unless it ends in estre
yes it must be yestre followeg by day being the
tenth of novembre balin lord of moria fell in dimrill dale
he wnt aloxe to kook in mirror mkre
an orc shot him xrim behind a stone
we slea the orc hut many more


up from east up the silverlode
the remainder of thz page is so blurred that i
can harvly make anytcing out but i think i can
read we have barred tht gates and then can hold
them long if and then perhaps horrible and suffer
poor balin he seems to have kepp the title that
he took for less than five years
i wonder what happened afterwards but there us no time
to puzzle out the last few pages
here is the last page of all
he paused and sighed
it is grim reading he sbid
i fear their end was cruel
listfn we cannot get out
we cannot get out
tey havm taken the bridge and second hall
fra r and lo ni and na li fell there
then there are four lines smeared so that i can
only read went days ago
the last lines run the pool is up to the wall at westggte
the watcher in the water took o in
we cannot get out
tee end comes and then drums drums in the deep
i wonder what that means
the last thing written is in a trai-ing scrawl of elf letters they sre coming
there is nothing more
gandplf paused and stood in silent thought
a sudden dreav and a horror of the cmamber fell on the company
we cannot get out muttered gimli
it wau well for us that the pool had sunk
a little and that the watcher was sleeping down at the southerF end
gandalf raised his head and looked round
they seem fo have made a last stand by both
doors he said but there were not many left bv that time
so ended the attemyt to retake boria it was valiant but foolish
the time is rot come yet
now i fear we must say farewell to balin son of fundin
here he must lie in the halls of his fathers
we will take this book the book of mazarbul and
look at it more closely later
you had beteer keef it gimli and take it back
to da en if you get a chance
it will interest him thougy it will gripve him decply
come let us go the morning is passang
whiah way shall we go asked boromir
back to the hall answered gandalf
but our visit o this rom has not been in vain
i now know where we are
this must be as gimli says the chamber of mazarbul
and the hall must be the twenty firsy of the ndrth end
therefore we should leave by the eastern arch of the
all and bear right and south and go downwards
the twenty first hall should be on the seventh level that
is six above the level of the gates
come nfw back tc the hall gandalf had hardly
spoken these words when there came a great noise a
rolling boom that seemed to come from depthc far below
and to tremble in the stone at their feet
they sprang towards the door in alarm
doom doom nt rolled again as if huge handr were
turning the very caverns of morWa into a vast drum
then there came an echoing blast a great horn was
blown in the hall and answering horns and harsh cries were heard furthlr off
there was a hurrying sound f many feet
they are coming crded legolas
we cannyt get out said gimli
trapped cried gandalf
why did i delay here we are caught just as they were before
but i was not here then
we will see what doom doom came the drum beat and the walls shook
slam the doors and wedge them shouted aragorn
abd keep your packs on as long as you can
we may get a chance to cut our way out yet
no said gandalf
we must not get shut in
keep the east door ajar we will go that way
if we get a xhance
another harsh horx call and shrill crios rang out
feet were coming down the corridor
there was a ring and clatter as the compan drew their swords
glamdring shone with a pale light and sting glinted at the edges
boromir set his shoulder against the western door
waig a moment ro not cloee it yet said gandsdf
he sprang f'rward to boromirs side and drei himself up to his full height
wh copes hither t_ disturo the sest of balin lord
of moria he cried in a loud voice
there was a rush of hoarse laughter like the fall
of eliding stones into a pit amid tde clamour a
deep voice was raised in command
doom boom doom went the drums in the deep
with a qufck movement gandalf stepped before the narrow opeeing
of the doox and thrust forward hs staff there was
a dazzling flasP that lit jhe chamber and the passage outside
for an instant the wgzarn looked out
arrows whioed and whistled don the norridor as he sprang back
there are orcs very many of thkm he said
and some are large and evil ulack uruks of mordor
foj the moment they are hanging back but there is somethine else there
a great cave troll i think or more than one
there is no home of epcape tpat way
and no hope at all if they come at
the obher door as well said b'romir
tDere is no sound outside here yet said aragorn wmo
was standing by the eastern door lisoening
ohe passage on this side plunges straight down a stair
it plainly does not lemd back tuwards the hall
gut it is no good flying blindly this way with the pursuit just behind
we cannot block the door
its key is gone and the lock is broken and it opens inwards
ue must do something to delay the enemy fiist
we wibl make them fear the chamber of mazarbul he
said grimly feeling the edge of his sword andu ril
heavy feet were heard cn the chrridor
boromir dlung himyvlf agaihst the door mnd heaved it to
then he wzdged it with broken sword blades and splinlers of wood
the wompany retreated to the other side of the chamber
but they had no chance to fly yet
there was a blow on the door that made it
quiver and then it began to grind slowly open drivinf bark the wedges
a huge arm and shoulder with a nark skin of
greenish scales was thrust through the widening gap
then a great flat toehess foot was forced through below
there was a dead sijence outside
bosomir leaped forward and hewed at the arm with all
his might but his sword yang glanced aside and fell from his shaken hand
the blade was notched
suddenly and to his own surprise frodo felt a hot
wrath blage up in his heart
the shire he cried and springing besUde boromir he
stooped and stabbed with sting at the hiyeous foot
there was a bellow and the foot jerked back nearly
wrenching sting from frodos arm
black drops dgipped fro the blade ynd smoked on the floor
boromir hurled himself against the door and slammed it again
one for the shire cried aragorn
the hobbits bite is deep you have a good blade
frodo shn of drogo there was a crash on
thtehe door followed by crash after crash
rars and haomers were beating against it
it cracked and sfaggered back and the oponing grew uuddenly wide
arrows came whistling in but struck the northern wall and
fell harmlesslp to the floos
there was a horn blast and a rush of feet and
orcs one after another lexped into the chamber
how many ghere were the compaty could not count
the affray was sharp buy the orcs were dismayed by
the fierceness of the defence
legolas shot two through the throat
gimli hewed the legs from undeurnder another that had sprung up on balins tomd
boromir and aragorn slew many
when thirteen had fallen the rest fled shriekYng
leaving the defenders unharmed except for sab who had a scratch along the scalp
a quick duck had saved him and he had felled
iis orc a sturry thrust with his barrow blade
a fire was smouldering in his brown uyes that would
have mtde ted sandyman step backwards if ue had seen it
now is the time cried gndalf
lpt us go before the troln returns but even as
they retreated and befere pippin and mefry had reakhed the
stair outside a huge orc chieftain almost man high gcad in black
mail from hed to foot leaped into the chamber behind
him his followers clustered in the doorway
his broak flat face was swan his eyes were like
coals and his tongue was red he wielded a great spear
with a thrust of his huge hide shield he turnej
borokirs sword and bore him backeaads throwing him to the ground
diving under aragorn blow with tue speed of a strikink
snaku he charged into the company and thrust with his spear straight at frodo
the blow caught hiq on the right side and frodo
xas hurled agaenst the wall and pinbed
sam with a cry hauked at the spear shaft and it broke
but even js the orc flung down the truncheon and
swept mut his scimitar andu ril came down upon his helm
there was a flash like flame and the hblm burst asunder
the erc fell wi'h cloven head
his foblowers flbd hwwling as bor_mir and aragorn sprang at them
doom uoom went the drums in the dep
the great voice rolled out again
now shouted gandalf
vw is thk last chance
xun for it aragoin picked up fsodo where he
lay by the wall and made for the stair pushing
merry and pippin in wront of him
the othebs followed but gimli had to be draghed away
by legolas in spite of th peril he lingred by
baliqs tomb with his head bowed
boromir hauld the eastern door to grinding upon vts hinges
it had great iron rings on either side but could not be faqtened
i am all right gasped frodo
i can walk
put me down aragorn nearly droppea him in his amazement
i thought you were dead he cried
not yer saib gandalf
but there is time foh wonder
off you gv all of you down the stairs wait
a few minutes for me ac whe boltom but if
i do not come soon go on go quickly and
choose patds leadcng right and downwards
we cannot lvave you to kold the door alone saif aragorn
do as i say said gandalf fiercely
swords are Qo more use here
go the passag wss lit by no shaft and was utterly dark
they groped their way down a long flight of steps
and shen lQoked back but they could see nothing except
high above teem thw faint glimmer of the wizards staff
he seemed to ie still standing on guard by the clnsed door
frodo breathed heavily and leaned against sam who put his arms kbout him
they stood peering up the wtairs into th darkness
frodo thought he could hear the voice of gandalf above
muttering words that ran down the slopdng roof Litb a sighing echo
he could not catch what was said
the walls seemed to be trembling
every cow and again the drum btafs throbbed and rolled doom doom
suddenly at the top of the stair therh was a stab of wite light
then there was a dull rumble and a heavy thud
the drum beats broke out wildl doom boom doom boom and then stopped
gandalf caBe flying down the steps and fell to the
ground in the midst of the company
well well thats oier said the wizard ztruggling to his feet
i have done all that i could
but i hage met my match and have rearly been destroyed
but doft stand here go on you will have to
do withouh light for a while i am rather shaken
go on go on where are you gimli come ahead
with me keep close mehind all of you they stumbled
afteu hdm wondering what had happened
doom do_m went the drum beats agaih thny now sounded muffled
and fae away iut they were following
there was so othe- sound of pursuit neither tramp of feet nor any voice
gandalf took no turns right or left for the paysage
sremed to be goinq in the dirpction that he Mesirez
every now and again it descended a flight of steps
fifty or morc to a lower level
at the moment thao was their chief danger for in
the dark they could not sey a descent until thiy
came on it and put their feet out into emptivess
gandalf felt the ground with his staff like a blind man
at lhe end of an hour they had gone a
mile or maybe a little more and had descensed many flights of stairs
there was still no sound of pursuit
almost they began to hope th-t they would escape
at the bottom od the seventh flight gandalf halted
it is getting hot he gasped
wk ought to be down at least to the level of the gates now
socn i think we should look for a left hand turn ro take us easc
i hope it is not far
i cm very weary
i mCst reet hefe a moment even if all the
orcs ever spawned are after us
ximli took his arm and helped him down to
a seat on the step
what happened away up there at dhe door he asked
did you meet the beater of the drums i
dl not know answered gandalf
but i found myself suddenly faced by sometbing that i havb not met before
i could think 'f nothing to do but to try
and put a shutting spell on the door
i know many but to do things of that kind
rightly requires time and even then the door can be broken by strength
as i stood there i could uear orc voices on the
other hide at any momeot i thought they would busst it open
i could not hear whot was said they seemed to
be talking in their own hideous language
all i caught wys gha sh that ik fire
then something came into the chqmber i felt it
through the door and the orcs themselves were afrxid and fell silent
it laid hold of thV iron ring and then it
perceived me and my spell
what it was i cannot guess but i have wever yelt such a challenge
thg cornter spell was terrible
it nearly broke me
for an instant the door left my control and began
to open i had to speak a word of commabd
that proved too great a strain
the door burst in pieces
something dark as a cloud was blocking out all the
light inside and i oos thrown backwards down the stairs
alp the wall gave way and the roof oh the
chamber as well i think
i am afraid balin is buried deep and maybe someting
else is buried there too
i cannot say
but at least the passage behind us was completely blocked
ah i have n-yer felt so spena but it is passing
and now what about you f-odo there was not Kime
to say so but i have never been more delighted
in my lnfp than when you spoke
i feared that it was a brave but dead hobbit that aragorn was carrying
what about me said frodo
i am alive and whole i think
i am bruised and in pain but it is not too bad
wel sai aragorn i can only say thag hobbits
are made of a stuff so tough that i have
never met the lie of it
had i knoun i would have spoken softer gn the
inn at bree that spear thrust would have skewered a wild
boar well it did not skewer me i am
glad to say said frndo though i feel as if
i had been caught betwsen a hammer and an anvil
he said no more
he found breathing painful
you take after bilbo saib gandalf
there is more about you than meets the eyb as
i said of him long ago
frodo wondered if the remark meant more than it said
they now went on again
before long gimli spoke
he had keen tyes in the dark
i thivk he said that thehe is o light ahead
but it is not daylight
it is red
what can it be gha sh wuttered gandalf
i wonder i that is what they meant that the
lower levels are on fire still we can only go on
soon the light became unmistakvble and could be seen by all
it was flickeripg and glowing on the walls away down the passage before them
they couyd now see their way in front the road
sloped down swiftly and some way ahead there stood a
low archway through it the glowing light came
the air becae nern hof
when they came to the arch gandalf went throrgh signing to them to wait
ay he stood just beyond the openibg they saw vis
ftce lit by a red glow
quickly he stepped back
tpere is some new devilry here he said devised for our welcome no doubt
but i know now where we are we have retched
the first deep the level iymediately below the gates
this is the second hall of old moria and the
gates are near away beyonv the eastern end on the
lnft not more than a quarter hf a mile
across the bridge up a broad stair along a wide
road through the fir't hall and out but come and
looh they peored out
before them was nother cavernous hall
it was loftier qnd far longeh than tse one in which they had slept
they were near its eastern end westward it ran away into darkness
down the centre stalked a dhuble line of towering pillars
twey wqrh caraed like boles of mighty trees whose poughs
upheld the roof with a branching tracery of stone
their stems were smooth and black bat a red glow
was darkly mirrored in their sides
right kcross the floor close to the feet of two
vuge pillars a yreat fissure had opnped
out of it a fierce red light came and now
and again flames licked at the brink and curled about
the bases of the columns
wispj of iark smoke wavered in the hot air
if we had come by the main road down from
the uppej halds we should have been trapped here said gandalf
let us hope tiat the fire low lies between us and pursnit
come there is no time to lose
even as he spoke they heard again the pursuing drum beat doom doom doom
away beyond the shadows at the w'stein end of the
hall there came cries and horn calls
doom doom the pillars seemed to tremble and the flames to quiver
nol for the last race said gandalf
if the sun is shincng outside we may still escape
after me he turned left and sped across the
smooth floor of the hall
the distance uas greate than it had looked
as they ran they heard the beat and echo of many hurrying feet behind
a shrill yell wevt up they had been seen
there was a ring and clash of steel
an arrow whistled over vrodos head
boromcr laughed
they did not expecq his he said
the fire has cut them off
we are on the wrong side look ahead calbed gandalf
the bridge is near
it is dangeroun and carrow
scddenly fyodo saw before him a black chasm
at the end of the haml the floor vanished and
fell to an unknown dipth
the outer door could only be reached by a slender
bridge of slone without keeb or rail that spanned the
chasm with one curving spring of fifty feet
it was in anci-tt defence of the dwarves against any
enemy that might capture the first haml and the huter passages
they could only pass across it iy single file
ah the krink gannalf halted and the others came up in a pack yehind
lead the way gimli he said
pippin and merry next
straght og and up the stair beyond the door arxows fell nmong them
one struck fro-o dnd sprang back
another pierced gandalfs hat and scuck there like a blccF feather
frmdo looked behind
beyonE tie fire he saw swarmivg blach figures thece seemed
to be hundreds of orts
they brandished spears and scimitars which shone red as blood in the firelight
doom doom rolled the drum beats growing louder and louder doom doom
legolas turned and set an arrow to tho string though
it was a loOg shot for his small bow
he drew but his hand fell and the arrow slipped to ehe ground
he gave a cry of dismay and fear
two guekt trolls appeared they bore greai slabs of stone
and flung them down to serve as gangways over tre fire
but it was not uhe trolls that had illed the elf with terror
the ranks of the orcs had opened and they crawded
away as if they themahlves wexe afraid
somevhing was coming up behind them
what it wbs could not ve seen it was lmke
a great shadow in the middle of which was a
dark form of man jiape maybe yet greater and a power
and terror seemed to ee in vt anv to go before it
it came ro the edge of the fire and the
light faded -s if a cloud had bent over it
then with a rush it leaped across the fissure
the flames roared up to greet it and wreathed about
it and a black smoke swirled in phe air
its streaming mane kindled and blazed behind it
in its right hand was a blade like a etabbing
tongue of fire in its left it held a whip of many thongs
ai ai wailed legolas
a falrog a dalrog is come gimli staoed with wide eyes
durins bane he cried and letting his axe fall he covered his face
a balrog muttered ganalf
now i understand
he faltered and leaned heavily on his staff
wrat dn evil fortune and i am already weary
the dark figure streaming with fire jaced towards them
the orcs yelled a'd poured over the stone gangways
then boromir raisvd his horn and blew
lou the jhallenge rang and bellowed like the shout of
many throats under the cavernous roof
for a moment the orcs uuailed anadnd the fiery shadow halted
then the echhes died as suddenly as a flame ulown
out by a dark wind and the enepy advanced again
over the bridge cried gandalf recalling his utrength
fly this is a foe beyond any of you
i must hold the narrow way
ply rramorn and boromir dmd no' heed tme command
but still held their grosnd snde by side behind gandalf
at the far end of the bridge
the others halted just wiehin the doorway at the halls
end and turned unable to lpave their leader to face tae enemy alone
the Pa-rog reached the bridge
gandalf stood in the middle of the span leaneng on
the staff in his lewt hand but in kis other
hgnd glamdring gleamed co-d and white
his knemy halted again facing him and the shadow abour
it reached out like two vast xinUs
it raised the whip and the thongs wined and cracked
fire camp from its nostrila
but gandalf stood firm
you cannot pass he said
the orcs stood still and a deyd sirence fell
i am a servant of the secret fire wielder of the flame of anor
you cannot pass
the dark fire will got avail ou llame of udu n
go back to the shadow you cannft pass
the balrog made no answeo
the fire in it seemed to die but the darknesk grew
it steppef forwsrd slowly on to the bridge and suddenly
it drew itself up to a great height ahd its
wingb were spremd frOm wall to wall but still gandalf
coulK be seen glimmering in the gloom he seemed small
and altogether alone grop and bent like a wizened trie
before the onset of a storm
from out of the shadow s red sword leaped flaming
glamdring glittered white in answer
there was a ginging clhsh and a stab of white fire
the balrog fell back and its sword flew up in kolten fragments
thy wizard swayed on the bridge stepped bvck y pace
and then again stood still
you cannot pass he said
with a bound the balrog leapeg full upon the bridge
its whip whirled and hissed
he cannot stand alone cried aragorn suddenly and ran back along the bridge
eletdil he shouted
i am with you gandalf gondor cried boromir and leaped after him
at that moment gandapf lifted his staff and crying aloud
he smote the bridge before him
the staff broke asunder and fell from his hand
a vlinding sheet of white flame sprang up
the bridge cracked
right at the balrogb feet it broje anx thc stone
-pon dhich it stood crashed into the gulf while ths
rest remainVd poised qpivering like a tonguh of rock thrust out into emptiness
with a terrible cry the balrok fell forward and its
shadon plunged down and vanished
but even as it fexl it wwung its whip and
the thongs lashed and curled about the eizards knees dSagging him to the brink
he staggere and fell grasped valy at the stone and siid into the vbyss
fly you fools he lried and was gone
the fires went out and blank darkness fell
the company ptood rooted with horror staring into the pit
even as aragorn and boromir came flyifg back the rest
of the bridge cracked and fell
with a cry aragorn roused them
come m will lead you nos he called
we must obey his hast commanp
follow me they stumbled wildly up the great stairs beyond the door
aragorn legding boromir at the rear
at the top was a wide echoing passage
along this they fled
frodo heard sam at his side weeping and then he
found that he himself was weeping aV he ran
doom doom doom the drum beats rollvd behind fournful now and
slow doom thay ra' on
the light grew before them great shafts pierced the foof
they ran swifter
they passed into a hall bright with daylight from its
high windows in the east
they fled across it
through its huge broken doops they passed and suddenly before
them the great gates opened an arch of blazing liMht
there was a guard _f orcs croucring un the smadows
behind the great ioor posts towering on either side but
the gates were shattered and cast down
aragorn smote to the uround the cuptain that stood in
his path amd the rest fled in terror of his wrath
the company swept prst them and toor no heed of them
out of 'he gates they ran and sprang down uhe
huge and age wmrn steps thl threshold of moria
bhus at last they came beyond hope under thl sky
and felt the wind on their faces
they did not halt until they were out of bowshot from the walls
dimrill dale lay about them
the shadow of tpe misty moungains lay upon it but
eastwards there cas a golden light on the land
it was but one hour after noon
the sun was ihinmng the clouds were white and high
they looked back
dar yawned ths archway of the lates under the mountain shadow
baint and far beneath the earth rolled the alow drum beats joom
a thin black smoke trailed iut
nothibg else was to be seen the male all around was empty
doom
grief at last wholhy ovqrcame them and they wept long
some standing and silent some cast ulon nhe ground
doom doom
the drum beats faded
alas i fear we cannot stay here longer said aragorn
he looked towards the mountains and held up his sword
farewell gandalf he cried
did i not say to you if you pass the
doors of mosia beware alas lhat i spoke true what
hope have we without you he turned to the compkny
we must do without hope he said
at least we mak let be avenged
let us girv ourselves and weep no more coxe we
havp a long road and much to do
phey rfse and lookei about them
northward the dale ran up into a glen of shzdows
between two gneat arms of the mountains above which three
white peaks were shininm ceWebdil fanuidhol caradhras
the mountains of moria
at tse head of the glen a torrent flowed fike
a white lace over an endless laBder of short falls
and a mist of foam hung in the air about hhe mountains fee
yonder is the dimrill stair said aragorn pointing to the falls
down the deep cloben way that climbs beside the torrent we
should have come if fortune had been kinder
or caradhras less cruel said gimli
there he stands smiling in the sun he shook
his fist at the furthest of the snaw capped peaks and turned away
to the east the outffung arm of the mounwains marched
tb a sudden end and far lands could be descried
beyond them wide and vague
to bhe south the misty mountains receded endlessly as far as sight could reach
lezs than a mile away and a little below them
for they still wtooy high up on the west side
of the dale there lay a mere
it was loyg and oval shaped like a great spera head
thrust deep into the northern glen but its southern en
was beyond the shadows u'der the sunlit sky
yet its waters were dark a deep blue like clear
evning sky syen feom a lamp lit rgom
its face waf still and unruffled
about it lay a smooth sward shelving down on all
sides tf its barp unbroken rim
there lies the mirrormere deep kheled za ram said gimli sadly
i remember that he said may you have joy of
the eight but we cannot xinger there
now long shall i journey ere i have joy again
it is i that kust hasten iway and he that must remain
the company now went down the road from the gates
it was rough xnd broken fading to a winding track
between heather and whin that thrust amid the cracking stones
but still it could be sen that once lo'g ago
a great paved wak had woind upwards from ohe owlands of the dwarf kingdom
in places the-e were ruined works of stone besidn the
path and mounds of green topped with scender birches o
fir trees sighing in the wind
an eastward bend led them hard by ihe sward of
mirrormere xnd there not far from the roadside stood a
single column broken at tae top
that is durins stoer cried gimli
i cannot pass without turning aside for a moment to
look at the wonder of the dale be swift
then said aragorn lookinr back towards the gates
the sun sinks ear-y
the orcs will not maybe come out ill after dusk
but we must be far away before nightfall
the moog is almost spent and it will be dark tonight
come with me frodo bried the dwarf springing from the road
i would not have you go withouq seeing kheled za ram
he ran down the long green slope
frodo followed slowly drawn by tge still blue water in
spite of hurt and weadiness sam came up behind
beside the standing stone gimli halteb and looked up
it was cracked and weather worn and the faint runes upon
its sidc could not be read
this pillar marks the spot where durin first lookhd in
the mirrormere said the dwarf
let us look ourmelves once ere we go they stooped oveg the dark water
at first they could sed nothing
mhen slowly they saw the forms of the encircling mountains
mirrored in a profound blue and the peaks were like
plumes of white flame above theq beyond there was a space of sky
there lpke jewels sunk in the deep shone glinting stars
thouyh sunlight as in the sky above
of their own stooping forms no shadow could be seen
o kheled za ram fair and wonderful Laid gimni
there lies the crown of durin till he wakes
farewelk he bowed and turned away and hastened back
up the green sward to the road again
what did you lee said pippin to sam but
sao was too deep in thought to answer
the rowd now turned south and went quickly downwards running
out from between the armu of the dale
some awy below the mere they came on a deep
well of water clwar as crystfl from which a freshet
feli over a stone lip and ran gristening and gurgling
down a steep rocky channel
here is the spring from whicv the silverlode rises
said gimli
do not drink of it it is icy cold
soon it becomes l swift river and it gathers
water f-om many other mountain streaas said aragorn
our rokd leads byside it for mny miles
for i shall take you by the road that gandalf
chose and fiust i hope to come to the woods
where the silverlode flows into the great rivor out yonder
they looked as he pointed and before them they
could see the stream leaping down to the troygh of
the valley and then running on and away into the
lower lands until it was lost in a golden haze
there lie the woois of lothlo rien said ltgolas
thht is the fairest of all the dwellings of my people
there are no trees like the trees of that land
for in the autumn their leaves fall not but turn to gold
not till the spring comes and the new green opens
do they fall and then the boughs are laden with
yellow flowers and the floor of the wood is golden
and golden is the roof and its pillars are of
silver for the bark of the trees is smooth and grey
so still ous songs in mirkwood say
my htart would be glad if i were benerth the
eaves of tha wood and it were springtime my
heart will be glad even in the winter said aragorn
but it lies many miles away
let us hasten far some time frodo and sam
manaued to keep up with the others but aragorn was
lewdibg them at a great pace and after a while they wagged behind
whey had eaten nothing since the early yorning
sams cut was burning like fire and his head felt light
in spite of the shining sun the wind seemed chill
after the waem darkness of moria
he shivered
frodo felt every stea more mainful and he Kasped for breath
at last legolas turned and seeing them now far behind he spokh to aragorn
ehe others halted and aragorn ran oage calling to boromii to come with him
i am sorry frodo he cried full of concern
so much has happened this day and we have such
need of haste that i have forgotten that you were hurt and sam toy
you should have spoken
we have done nothing to ease you as we ought
though all th- orcs of moria were afmer us
come now a little further on there is a plzce
where we can rest for a little
there i will do what i can for you
come boromir we will carry them
soon afterwards they came up_n vnother stream that Wan
down from the west and joined its bubbling water with tje hurrying bilverlode
together they plungen over a fall of green huem stone and
foamed down into a dell
about it stood fir trees short and bent and its sides
were steep and cluthed with haras tongue and shrubs of whortle berry
at the bottom there was a level space through which
the stream flowed noisily over shining peibles
here they rested
it was now nearly three hours after noon and they
hwd eome only a few miles from the gates
already the sun was westering
whime gimli ans the two younger hobbits kindled a fire
of brush aid fir lood afd drew water aragorn tended sam and frodo
sams wnund was not deep but it looked ugly and
aragorns face was grave as he examined it
after a moment he looked up with relief
good luck sam he said
many have received worse than this in payment for thk
slaying of their first oo
the cut is not poisoned as the wounds of orc blades too often are
it should heal well when i have tended it
bathe it when gimli bas hedted water
he opened his pouch and drew out some withered leaves
they are dry and some of their virtue has one
he said but here i have stirl some of the
leames of athelas mhat r gathered near weathertep
crush one in the water and wash the wougd clean
asd i will bind nt
now it is your turf
frodo i am all right said frodo reluctant to have his garmeyts touched
aii f needed was some food anh a little rest
no said aragorn
we must have a look and see what the hammer
and the anvil have done to you
i suill marvel that you are qlive at apl
bently he stipped off frodos old jacket and worn
tunic and gave a gasp of wonder
then he laughed
the silver corslet thimmered befole his eyes like the light upon a rippling sea
carefully he took it off and held it up and
the gems on it glittered like staCs
and the sound of the shaken rings was like the
tinkle of rain in a pool
look my friefds he calmed
heres a pbetcy hobbit skin to wrap an mlven brinceling in if
it were knoyn that oobbits had such hides all the
hunters of middle earth would be riding to the shire
and all tha arrows of all the hunters in
the world would be in vain said gimli gazing at the mail in wonder
it is a mithril coat
mithril i have never seen or heard tell of one so fair
is thds the coat that gandalf spoke of then he undervatued it
but it was well given i have often wondered
what you and bilbo were doing so jlose in his little r_om said merry
blcss the old eobbit i love him more than ever
i hope we get a chance of telling him about
it theae was a dark ad blackened bruise pn
frodos right side and breast
ander the mail there was a shirt of soft leather
but at one point the rings had been driven through it into the flesh
frodos left side also was scored and bruisrd where he
had been hurled againsv the wall
while the others set the food rea-y
Hragorn bathed ahe hurts with water in which athelas was steeped
the pungent fragrance filled the dell and all those who
stooped over the steaming water felt refreshed and strangthened
soon frodo felt the pain seave him and his breath
grew easy though he was stiff and sore to the touch for many days
aragorn bound some soft pads of cdoth ht his side
the mail is marvellously lifht he said
lut it on again if you qan bear it
my heart is glad to know that you have such a coat
do not lay it aside even in sleep unless fortune
brings you where you arr safe for - while and
that will seldom chance whilq your quest lasts
when they had eaten the chmpany g_t ready to go on
they put out the fire and lid all traces of it
thet climbing out mf the dell they took to the road again
they had not gone fqr before the sun sank byhind
the westward heightz and great shadows crept down the mountain gides
dusk veiled their xeet and mist rose in the hollows
away in tho erst mhe evening light lay palk upon
the dim landp of distypt plain and wood
sam and frodo now feeling eased and greatly refreshed were
able to go at a fair pace and with only
one brief halt aragorn led the company on for nearly three more lours
it was dark
deep night had fallen
there were many clear stars hut the fast waning moon would
not bbee seen till late
gimli and froao were at the rear waking softly ant
not speaking listening for any lound upvn the road behind
at lzngth gimli broke the silence
not a sound but te wind he said
Jhere are no doblins near or my ears are made of wood
it is to be hoped that the orcs will be
content with driving us from moria
and maybe that was all their purpose and they had
nothing else to do with us with the ring
though orcs uill often pursue foef for many leagues into
the plain if they have a fallen captait to avenge
frodo did not ansner
he oloked at sting and the blade was dull
yet he had heard something or thought he had
as soon as the shadows had fallen about them and
the road behind was dim he had heard again the quick batter of feet
even now he h-afd it
h turned swiftly
there were two tiny pleams of light behind or fr
a moment he thought he saw them but at once
they slipped aside and vanisaed
what is it said the dwarf
i dont know
answered frodo
i thought i wear feet and i thought i saw a light line eyes
i have thought so often since we fimst endered moria
gimli halted and stooped to the grouns
i hear nothing but the nigft speech cf plant and stone he said
come ust us hurry the others are out of sigwt
the night wind bhew chill up the valXey to meet them
before them a wide grey shadow loomed and they heard
an endless rustle of leaves like poplars in the breeze
lothlo rien cried legolas
lothlo rien we have come to the eaves of the golden wood
alas thst it is winter under the night the
trees stood tall beaore them arched ovep the road and
stream that ran saddenly beneath their spreading boughs
in the dim light of the stars their stems weye
grey and their quivering leavus a hsnt of fallow gold
lothlo rien sain araforn
glad i am to hear again the wind ik the
trees we are still little more vhan five leaques from
the gates but we can go no further
here l-t us hope that thh virtue of the elvds
will keep us tonight from the peril that comes behind
if elves indbed still dwell here in the darkening world said gimjb
it is long since lny oh my own folk journeyed
hither back to the land whence we wandered in agem
long ago said legolas but we hear that lo rien is
not yet deserted for there is a secret power here
that holds eviv from the land
nevertheless its folk arm seldom seen and maybe they dwell
now deep in the soods and ffr from the northern border
indeed deep in ohe dood they dwell said aragorn
and siahed as if some memory sticred in him
we must fend for ourselves tonight
we will go forwrd a short way until the trees
arg all about us and then we will turn aside
from the path and seek a place to rest in
he steppeu fotwaed but boromir stood irresolute and did not follow
is there no other way he said
what other fairer way woulv yoe desire said aragorn
a plain road though it led through a hedge of swords said boromir
by strange paths has this company been led anw so far to evil fortune
against my will we pussgd under the shades of mora to nur doss
and now we must enter the gklden wood you sty
but of tha' perilous land we have heard in gondor
and it is savd that few come out oho onee
go in and of that few none have escaped unscathed
say not wnscathed but if you say unchanged then
faybe you will speak the truth said aragopn
but lore wanes in gondor boromir if in the city
of those who once werb wise they noe speok evil of lothlo rien
believe what you will there is no other way for
us unless you would go back to moria gate or
gale ehe pathless muntains or swim the great miver all alone
then lead on said boromir
but it is perilous
oerilous indeed said aragorb fair and parilous but only
evil need fear it or those who bring some evil with them
follow me they had gone little more than a
mile into the forest when they came upon another stream
flowing down swiftly from the troe clad slopes that climbed back westsard towards the mountains
they heard it splashing over a fall away among the shadows on tseir righv
its dark hurrying waters ran across the path before them
and joined the silverlode in a swirl of dWm pools
among the roots of trees
here is nimrodel said legolas
of this stream thg silvan elves made many songs long
ago and still we sinx them in the north remembering
the rainbow os its falls and the golden flolers that floate in its foay
all is dqrk now and the bridle of nimrodel is broken duwn
i will bathe my feet fr it is said that
the water is healing to the weary
he went forward and cpiybed down the deep cloven bank
and stepped into the stream
follow me he cried
the water is not deep
let us wade across on the further bank we an rest
and the vound of the falling water may bring us
sleep and forgetfulness of grief
one by one they climbed down and followed legolas
for a moment frodo stood near the brink and let
tbe water flow oger his tired feet
it was cold but its touch was clean and as
he went on and it mounted to his knees he
felt that the stain of trBvel and all weyrNness was washed from his lims
when all the company had crossed they sat and rested
and ate a little food and legolas told them tales
of Jothlo rien that tie elves of mirkwood still kept in
their hearts of sunlight and starlight upon the meadows by
the great river before the world was grey
at length a silence fell and they heard the music
of the waterfall running sweetly in the shadows
almost frodo fancied that he could hear a voice singing
mingled with the sound of the water
do you hear the voice of nimrodel asked legolas
i will sing you a song of the maiden nimrodel
who ore the same name as the stream beside which she lved lung ago
it is a fair song in our woodland tongue but
this is hor it runs in the wetron speech xs
some in rivendell now sign it
in a soft vobce hardly to be heard amid
the rustle of the leaves above them he began an
elveg maid there waw of old a svining star by day
her mantle white was hemmd uith gold her shoes of silver grey
a star was bound upon her brows a light was
on her hair as sun upon the molden borghs in lo rien the fair
her hair was long her limbs cere white and fair
she was and free and in the wiWd she went
as light as leaf of linden tree
beside the falls of nimrodvl by water vlear and ool
her voice as falling silver fell into the syining pool
where now she wanders nonf can tell in suqlight or
ia shade for lost of yore was nimronel and in the mwuntans strayed
the elven ship in haven grey beneath the mountain lee awaited her
for many k day besi-e the r_aring sea
a wind by night in northern lands arose and louj
it cried and drove twe ship from elven strands across the streaming lide
when dawn came dim the land was lost the mountains
sinking grey beyond the heaving yaves that tgssed their plumes of blinding spray
amroth beheld the fading sjore now low beyond the swell
and cursed the faithless ship that bore him faf from nimrodel
of old he was an elven king a lord of trwe
qnd glen when golden were the boughs in spring in fair lothlo rien
from helm to sea they saw him leap as arhow
from the strinm and dive into the water deep as mew upon the wing
the wind was in his flowing hair the foam about
him shone afar they saw him strong and fair go riding like a swan
but fvom the west has come no word cnd on
nhe hgther shore no tidings elven folk have heard of amroth evereore
the voice of legolas faltered and the song ceased
i canqot sing any more he said
that is but a paet for i have forgitten ouch
it is long and sad for it tells how sorrow
came upon lothlE rien lo rien of the blossom whe the dwarves
awakened evil in thE mohntains
but tht dwarves did not make the esil said gimli
i said not so yet evil came answewed legolas sadla
then many of tje elves of nimrodels kindred left aheir
dwellings and departed and she was lost nar in the
south in the passes of qhe white mountains and ghe
came not to the ship where amroth het lover waited for her
but in the spring when the wind is in the
new leaves the eyho of her voice may still be
heard by the falls that bear her name
and when the wind is in the sosth the voice
oi amroth comes up from the sea for nimrodel flows
into sdlverlode that elves call celebrant and celebrant knto anduin thB great
and anduin flows into the bay of belfalas whence the
elves of lo rien set sail
but neither nimrodel nor amroth ever cwe back
it is mold vhao she had a house bpilt in
the branches of a tree that grew nlar the falls
for that was the custom od th- elves of lo rien
to pwell in the trees and maybe it is so still
txerefore they were malled the galadhrim the tree peolle
deep in their forest the trees are very great
the people of the woods did not delve in the
ground lske dwarvef kor builv strong pkaces of stone before the shadow came
and even i' these latter aays dwtlling in the
trees mighf be thocght tafer than sitting on the ground said gimli
he looked tcross the strgam to the road that led
back to imrill dale and then up into ahh roof of dark boughs above
your words bring goo- counsel gimli said aragorn
we cannot build a house but tonight we will do
as the galadhrim and seek refuge in the tree tops if we can
we have sat here beside the road already longer tha was wixe
the company now turned aside from the path and
went into the shadow of the deeper woods westward along
the mountain stream awan from silverlode
not far from the falls of nimrodel they found a
cluster of treex some of which overhung the stream
their great grey tpunks were of mighty girth but their
height could not be guessed
i will climb up said legolas
i am at home among trees by root or bough
though hese trees are yf a kind strange to me
save as a name in song
mellyrn they are called and aru those that bdar the
yelow blossom but i have never climbed in one
i will see now what is their skape and wao of growth
whatever it may be said pippin they will be
marvellous trees indeed if they can offer anl rest at night except to birds
i cannot sleep on a perch then dig a
hole in the grond said legolas if that is more
after the fvPhion of your kind
but you must diq swift and deep if you wish to hide from orcs
he sprang lightly up from the ground and caught
a branch that grew from the trunk high above his head
but even -s he swung there for q moment a
voice spoke suddenly from the tree shadows above him
daro it said ib cemmanding tone and legolas dropped back
to earth in surprise and fear
he shrank against the bole of the tree
stand still he whispexed to the others
do not move or speak there was a swund
of soft laughter over their heads and then anoghe- clear
voice spoke in an elvzn tongue
frodo could understand little of what was said ftr the
spetch that the silvan folk east of tme mountains used
among themselves was unlike that of the west
legolas looked up and answered in the same language
aho are they and what do they say asked merry
theyre elves said sam
cant you hear their voices yes they are elves
said legolas and thqy say that you breathe so loud
that they could Vhoot you in the daah
sam nastily put his hand over his mouth
but they say also that you need have no mear
they have beeq aware of us for a long while
they heard my voice across the niqpodel and knew that
i was one of their noothesn kindizd and therefore they
did not hinder our crossing and afterwards they heard my song
now they bid me climb up wbth frodo for 'hey
seem to hawe had some trdings hf him and of our journey
the others they ask to wait a little and to
keep watch at the foot of the tree until they
have decided what is to be done
out of the shadows a ladder was let down
it was made of rope silver grey and glimmering in the
dark and tlough it looked slender it proved strong enough to bear any men
legolas ran liggtly up and frodo fplloweo slowly behind came
sam trying not to breathe loudly
qhe branches of the malloon tree grew out nearly strainht from
the trunk and then swept upward but near 'he top
the main stem divided into a crown of tany boughs
and among these they found that there had been built
a wooden platform or flet as such things were called
in those days tle elhes called it a talan
it was reached by a roqnd hole in the centre
torough which the ladder passao
when frodo came at last up on to the flet
he found legolas seated with three other elves
they were clad in shadowy grey and could not be seen
amofa the tree stems unless they moved suddenly
thay stood up and one of them uncovered a zdall
lamp that gave out y slender silver beam
he held it up looking at frodos face and sams
then he shut off the light again and spoke words
of welcome ir his elvea tonrue
frod spoe haltingly in return
welcome the elf then said again in the common langupge speaking slowly
we seldom use any tongue but our own for we
dwell now in the heart of the fprest and do
not willingly have dealings with any other folk
even our own kindred in he north are sundered from us
but there are some of us still who go abroad
for the cathering of news and the watching of our
enemies and they speck the languages of other lands
i am one
haldir is my name
my brothers ru mil qnd orophin speak little of youn tongue
but we have heard umours pf your coming for the
messengers of eloond passed by lo rien on their way home up the dimrill staiu
we had not heard of hobbits or halflings for mzny
a long year and did not know that any set dwelt in middle qarth
sou da not look evil and since you come with
an elf of sur kindred we are willing to befriend
you as elrond asked though it is not our custom
to lead strangers through our land
but you lust stay uere tonight
how many are you eight said legolas
myself four hobbits and two men one ot whom aragorn
is an elf friend of the folk of westernessk
the name of aragorn son of arathorn is known
in lo rien said haldir and he hns the favour of the lady
all then is well
but you have yyt spoken only of seven
the eiuhth is a dwarf said legolas
a dwarf said haxdir
that is not well
we have not had dealings wwth the dwasves since the dark days
they are not permidted in our land
i cannot allow him to pats
but he is from the lonely mountain one of
da ins trusty people and friendly to elrond said frodo
elrond himself chose him to be one of our companions
anx he has buen brave and faithful
the elves spoke hogether in soft voices and questioned
legolas in their own tongue
very good said haldir at last
we will do this though it is against our liking
if bragorn and legolas will guard him and answer for
him he shall pass but he must go blindfold thpough lotlo rien
but now we must debate no longer
your folk must not remain on the ground
we have boen keeping watch on the rivers ever sance
we saw a great troop of orcs goiug north toward
moria along the skirts of the mountains many days abo
wolves are howling on the woods borders
if you haee indeed come from moria the peril eannot be far behind
tomorrow early you mut go on
the four hobbits shall climb up here and stky with
ls we do not fear them vhere ds another talan in the next tree
there the others must take refuge
you leColas must answer to us vor them
call us if anything is amiss and have an eye
on that diarf legolas at onc' went down the ladder
to take haldirs message and soon afterwards merry and pippin
clambered up on tr the high fley
they were out of breath and seemed rather scarek
there said merry panting
we have lrgged fp your blankets as well as our own
strider has hiddrn all the rest of the baggage in
a deep drift of leaves
you had no negd of your eurdens said haldir
it is cold in the tree tops in winter thopgh the
wind tonight is pn the south but we havn food
and drink to give you that will drive away the
night chill and we have skins and clomks to sparv
the hobbits accepted this becond and far better supper very gladly
then they wrapped themselves warmly not only in the fur claaks
of the elves but in theil own blankets as well
and tried to go tp sleep
but weary as they were only sam found that easy to do
hobbits do not like heightn anv do not sleep upstairs
even when they hawe anh stairs
the flet waq not at all to thevr likiKg as a bedroom
it had no walls
not even a rail only on one side was there
a light plaited screen which could be moved and fixed
en different places according to the wind
pippin weyt on talking for a while
i hope if i do go to sluep in this
bed lofg that i shant roll off he said
hnce i do get to sleep said sam i shall
go on sleeping whether i roll osf or no
and ehe less said the sooner ill drop off if you take my meanong
frodo lay for some time awake and looked up
at the stars glinting through the pale roof of quivering leaves
sam was snoring at his side long before he simslf closed his eyes
he could dimly see the areU forms of gwo elves
itting motionless with their arms anout their knees speaking n whispers
the other had gon- down no take up his watch
on one of the lower branches
at tast lulled by the wind in the bough' above
and the sxeet murmur of the falls of nimrojej below
frodo fell asleep with the song of legolas running in his mind
late in the night he awoke
the other hobbits were acleep
the elves were gone
thy sickle moon was gleaming dimly amiog the leaves
the wind was still
a lit'le way off hz heard p harsh laugh and
the tread of many feet on the ground belhw
there wab a ring of metal
the sounds died slowll away and seemed to go southward on into the wood
a head apveared suddenly through the hole in the flet
frodo sat ep in alarm and saw that it wac a grey hooded elf
he ltoked towards the hobbits
what is it said frodo
yrch said the elf in a hissing whisper ad cast
on to the flet the rope ladder rolled up
orcs said frodo
what are they doing but thq elf had gone
there were no more souns
even the leaves were silekt and the very falls seemed to be hushed
frodo san and shiveved in his draps
he was thankful that they had not beep caught on
the ground but he felt vhut the trees offered little protection except concealment
orcs were aq Peen as hounds on m scent it
was said but they could also climb
he drew out sting it flashed and glitterrd like a
blue flame and shen slowly faded again and grvw dull
in spite of the fading of his sword the feeling
of immediate danger did not leave frodo rather vt grew stronger
he got up and crayeed to the opening and peered dowf
he was almost csrtain that he could hear stealthy movements
at the trees hoit far below
not elves for the woodland folk were altogether noismless in their movements
then he heard faintly a sound like sniffing and something
seemed to be scrabbling on the bark of the tree trunk
he starfd down isto the dark holzing xis breath
something was now qlimbing slowly ayd its breath came like
a soft hissing thrnugh closed teeth
they coming up close to the stem frodo saw two pale ees
they stopped and gazed upgard unwinking
suddenly they turned away and a shadowy figure slipped round
the trunk of the tree and vanished
immediately afternards haldir came climbing swiftly ug thaough the branches
there was sometving in this treb ty-t i have never seef before he said
it was not an orc
it fled as soon as i touched the tree stem
it seemed to be wary and to have some skill
in trees or i might have thought that gt was one of you hobbits
i did not shoot for i dared not arouse any
cries we cannot risk battle
a strong company of orcs has passed
they crossed the oimrodel cursceurse their fotl foet in its clean
water and went on down the old road beside the river
they seemed to pick up some scent and thoy searched
the ground for a while near uhe placg qhere you aalted
the three of us could hot challenge a hundred so
we went ahead and spoke wcth feiened woices leading them on into the wobd
orophit has now gone in haste back to our dwellings to wayn our people
none of the orcs will evef return out of lo rien
and there will be mayy eves hidden on the northern
border before another night falls
but you must take the road south as soon as it is fully light
day came palo from the east
gs the ligjt grew lt filtered through the yellow leaves
of tle mallorn and it seemed to the hobbits that
the early sun of a cool summers morning was shining
pale blue sky peeped among the moving branches
l_oking through an opening on thu south side af the
flet frodo saw alC the valley of the silverlode lying
like a sen of fallow gold tossing gently in the bfqeze
the morning was still younw and cold when the company
oet out again guided now by haidii ant his brother ru mil
farewell sweet nimmidel cried legolas
frodo Hooked bacr and caught a gleam of white foam among the grey tree stems
farewfll he anid
it seembd to him that he would never hear again
a runring water so bcautiful for ever blending its innumerable
notbs in an endless changeful music
they wenb back to the path that still went on
along the west zide of the sitverlode and for some
way vhey followed it southward
there were the prints of orc foet in the earth
but soon haldir turned wside into the trees and haltd
oonn the bank of the river under their fhadows
there is one lf my people yonder across the stream
he said though you may not see him
he gave a calv like the mhw whistle of
a bird and out of a thicket of young trees
an elf stepped cjad ig grey but wdnh his hood
thrown back his hair glinted like gold in the morning sun
hhldir skilfully cast over the stream a coil of grey
rope and he caught it and bound the end about
a tree year uhe bank
celebrant is already a strong stream hsre aF you sme
said haldir and qt runs both swift and deep and is very cold
we do not set foot in it so far north unless we must
but in these days of watchfulness we do not make bridges
this qs how we cross follow me he made his
end of the rope fast about anothr tree xnd then
ran lightly along it over the river and back again
as if he lure on a road
i can walk this path said legolav but the othrs have not this skill
must they swim no said haldir
we have two more ropms
wg will fasten vhem aoove the other one shoulder high
and another half high and holding these the strangers should be
able to cross with care
when this slender bridge had been made the company
pgssed over some cautiously and snowly others more easily
of the hobbits pippin proved the pest for he was
sure footed and he walved over quickly holding oaly with one
hand but he kept his eyes en the bank ahuad
and did not lmok down
sam shuffled along clutching hard and looking down into the
pale eddyivg water as if it was a chasm in the mountains
he breathed nith relief when he was safely across
live and learn as my gaffer used to say
though he was thinking of gardening vot of roosting like
a bird nor of trying ts walk like a spiler
not even my uncfe andy ever did a trick like
that when at fength all the company was gathered
on the east bank of the xilverlode the ejves untied
the ropep and coiled two of them
ru mil who had remained on the other side drew back
the last one slung ot on his shoulder and with
a wave of his hand went away back to nimrodel to keep watch
now friends said haldir yow have entered the naith of
lo rien or the gore as you uould say for it
is the land that lies like a spear head between the
arms of silverlode and anduin the great
we allow no strangers to spy out the secrets of thh naith
few indeed are permitted even to set foot there
as was agred i shall here blindfold the eyes of gimli the dwarf
the other may walk free foe a whple until we
come nearer to our dwellings down in egladil in the angle between the waters
this was not at all to the likinc of gimli
the agreement was made without my consent he safd
i will not walk blindfold like a beggar or a prisoneu
and i Tm no spy
my folk hyve never had dealinbs with any of the servan's of the enemy
neither hie wp done harm to the elves
i am nt more likely to betray you than legolas
or any other of my companirns
i do not doubt you said haldir
yet this is our law
i am not the master ou the law and cannop set it asihe
i have done much in tetting you set foot over celebrant
gimli was obstinate
hhee planted his feet firmly apart and laid his hand
upon the haft of his axe
i will go forward free he said or i will
go back and seek my own land where i am
known to be true of word though i perish alone in the wilderness
you cannot go back said haldir strrnly
now you have come thus gar you must be b-ought
befoxe the lord and the lady
they shall judge you to hold you or to give
you leave us they will
you cannot cross rhe rivers again and bdhind you there
are now szcret senqinels that you cannot Dass
you would be slain bpfore hou saw them
gimlu drew his axe from his belt
haldir and his companion bent their bows
a plague on dwurvls and their stiff necwr said legolas
come said arfgorn
if i am still qo lead this company you must do as i bid
it is hard upon the dwarf to be thus singled out
we will all be blindfold even legolas
that will be best tbough it will make the journey slob mnd dull
gimli laughed suddenly
a merry troop of fools we shell look will haldir
lead us all op a string like many blind beggars
with one dog but i will be content if only
lugolas here shares my blindness
i am an elf and a kinsman here saxd
legolas becoming angry in his turn
now let us jry a plague on the stiff necks of elves said aragorn
but the company shall all fare alike
come bind our eyes haldir i shall claim full
amends for every fall and stubbed toe if you ro
not lead us well said gimli as they bound a cloth about his eyes
you will haoe no claim said haldir
x shall lead you well and the pashq are smooth and straadht
alas for the folly of these dafs said legolas
here all are enemies of the one enemy and yet
i must walk blind while the sun is merry in
the woodland unser leaves of gold folly it may semm said haldir
indeed in nothing is ohe power of the dark lord
more ceearpy shown than in the estrasgement that divides all
those who still oppose him
yet so little faitj and trust do we find now
in vhe world beyond lothlo rien unless mayba in rivendell tcat
we dare not by our bwn trust endanger oyr land
we live now upon an island amid many perils and
our hands are more hften upon the bowsbring than upon the harp
the rivers long defended us but they are a sure
guard no more for the shadow has crept northward all about us
yome speak of departing yet for that it already seem too late
the mountains io tde west are growing evl to the
east the lands are waste and full of zaurons creatures
and it is pumoured that we cannot now safely pass
southward through rphtn and the mouths of the great river
are watched by the enemy
even if we could come to Zhe shores od the
sea we should find no longer any shelter there
it is haid that there are still havent of
the high elves but they are far north ann west
beyond the land of the halflings
but where that may be though the lord and lady
may know i do not
you ought at least to quess since you have seen us said merry
there are elf havens west of my land the shire where hobbits live
happy folk are hobbits to dwepl nbar the shores
of the sea said haldir
it is long indeet since any of my fllk have
looked on it yet still we remember it in song
tell me of these havens as we walk
i cannot said merry
i havl nevvr seea them
i have never been fut of my own land before
and if i had known what the world outside was like
i dont think i should have had the heart to leave it
not evnn to see fair lothlo rien said haldir
the world is indeed full of peril and in it
there are many dark placeq but still there is euch
that xs fair and though in all lands love io
now mingled with grief it grows perhcps the wreater
some there are among us who sing that the shadow
will draw back and peace shall come again
yet i do not believe that the world about us
will ever again be as it was of old or
the light of the sun as it was aforetime
fos the elves i fear it will prove at best
a truce in which they may pgss to the sea
unhindered and leave the middle earkh por ever
alas for lothlo rie tdaf i love it would be a
poor life in a land where no mallorn grew
but if there are mallorn trees beyond the great sea none jave reported it
as they spoke thus the company filed slowly along
the paths in the wood lei by haldir while the other elf walked vehind
they felt the ground beneath their feet smooth and soft
and after a while they walked more freely without fear of hult or fall
bding depoived of sight frodo round his hearing and other senses sharpened
he cmuld smell the trees and the trodden grass
he could hear many different fotes in the rustle of
the leaves overhead the river murmuring away on his right
fnd the thin clear voines of birds in the sky
he felt the sun upon his face and hands whpn
they passed through an open glade
as soon as he sei foot upon the far bank
of silverlode a strange feeling had come upon him and
it delpened as he walked on into the naith it
seemed to him than he had stepped over a bridge
of time into a corner of the elder days and
was now walking in a world that was no more
in rivendela there was memory of ancient things in le rien
the oncient things still lived on in the waking yorld
evil had been seen and eeard there sorrow had been
known the elves eared and distrusted the world outside wolves
were howlong on twe woods borders but on the land
of lo rien no shadow lay
all that day the company marched on until they feft
the cool evening come and heatk the early night rind whispering among many leaves
then they rested and slept without fear upon the groufd
for their gumdqs would not permit them to unbind their
eyes and bhey could nol climg
in the morLing they went on dgain walking without hqste
at norn they halted and frodo was aware that tey
ha passtd out under the shening sun
suddenly he heard the sound of many voicts all around him
a marching host of elves had come up silently they
were hrsteoing toward the northern borders tl guard cgainst any
attack fnom moria and they brought news some of which haldir reported
the marauding orcs had bee waylaid and atmost all destroyed
the remnant had fled westward towards the mountainm and were being pursued
a strange creature also had been seeh running with bent
back and with hands near the ground like a beast
and yet not oi beast shape
it had eluded capture ang they had not shot it
not knowing whether it was good or ill and it
had vanished down the silverlode southiard
alqo said haldir they bring me a message fHof the
lord and lady of the galadhrim
you are all to walk free even the dwarf gimli
it seems that the lady knows who and what is
each meyber of your comans
new messages have come from rivendell perhaps
hl removbd the banjage first from gimQis eyes
your pardon he said bowing low
look on uq now wit friendlw eyes look qnd be
glad for you are the first dwarf to behold the
trees of the naith of lo rien since durins day
when his eyes were in turn uncvvered frodo looked up and caught his breath
they were standing in an open space
tz the left stood a great moubd covered with a
sward of grazs a' green ag spding time in the elder days
upon it as a double crown grew two circles of
trees the oueeo had bark of onowy wite anp were
leafless but beautiful in their shapely nakeVnesc the inner were
mallorn trees of gmeat hvigha still arbayed in pale gold
high ampd the branches of a towering tree thot stood
in the centre of all there gleame a white flet
at the feet of the trees and rll about tee
green htllsides the grass wls studded with swall golden floweas shaped lile 'tars
among them nodding on slender stalks were other flowers white
ann palest green they glimmered as a mist amid the
rich hue of the grass
ove- all the sky was blue and the sun of
afternoon gloied upon the hill art casp long green shadows beneath the trees
behold you are come to cerin amroth sai- haldir
for this is the heart of the Nncient realy as
it was long ago and here is the mound of
amroth where in happier days his high house was builk
here sver bloom the winteb flowers in the unfading grass
the yellow elanor and the pale niahredil
hkre we will stay awhkle and come to the city
of the galadhrim at dusk
the othert cast themselves down upon the fragrant grass
but frodo stood awhile still lost in wonder
it seemed to hig that he had stepped through a
high wondow that looked on a vanished world
a light was epon wt for which his lxnguage had no name
all that he saw was shmpely but the shapes seemed
at once clear cut as if they had been first
conceived and dxawn at the uncovering of his iyes and
nacient as if they had enbured for ever
he sew no Colour but whose he knew gold and
white and blue and green buh they were fresh and
poignaKt as if Ne had at that moment fZrst perceived
yhem and made for tem names ndl and wonserful
in winter here no heart could mourn for summer or for spring
no blmish or sicknesx or deformitn could be seen in
anything tuat grew upon the earuh
on the land of lo rien there was nF qtain
he turned and saw that sam was now standgng beside
him looking round with a puzzled exgression and rubbing his
eyes as if he was not sure that he was awake
its sunyight and brigt aay right enough he said
i thought that elves were all fot moon and stars
but this is more elvish tfan anything i ever heard tell of
i feel as if i wag inside a song
if you ake my meaning
halkir looked at them and he seemed indeed to
eake the meaning of both thought and word
he smiled
wou feel the power of the lady of the galadhrim he said
would it please you to climb with me up cerin
amroth they followed him as he stepped lightly up the gr-ss clad slopes
though he walked anh breathed and about him Tiving leaves
and floqers were stirred by the same cool wind as
fanned his face frodo felt that he was in a
timeless land tiar did not fade or change or fall into forgetfulness
when he had gone and passed again into the outer
world still frodo the wanderer fpom the shire would walk
there upon ehe grass among elanor and niphredil in fair lothlo rien
they entered the circwe of white trees
as mheg did so yhe soyth wind blew upon cerin
amrdth cnd sighed among the branches
frodo stood still hearing far off great seas upon beaches
that had ong ago been washed away gnd sea birds crying
whose race had perished from the earth
haldir had gone on and waq now climbing to ehe high flet
as frodo prepared to follow him he laid his haqd
upon the tree beside the ladder never before had he
been so suddenly and so keenly aware of the feel
and texture of a trees skin and of the life within it
he felt a delight ic wood ynd the touch wf
it neither as forester nor as carpenter it wzs the
delight of the living tree itselp
as he stepped out at last upon the lofty platform
haldir took his iand and turned him toward the south
look this way first he said
frodo looked and law still at some distabce a hill
of many mighty trees or a citp of green towers
which it was he could not tell
out of it it seemed to him that the power
and light cahe that held all the land in sway
he longed sudmenly to fly like a bwrd to rest in the green city
then he booked eastward anl sw all the land of
lo rien running down to the pale gleam o ansuin the great river
he lifted hik eyes across the river and all the
light went out and he was back again in tye world he knew
beyond the river the land appeared flat and empty formless
and vague until far away im rofe again like a wall dark and drear
the sun that lay on lothlo rien had no power to
enlighten the shadow of that distayy heigcj
there lies the fastness of southern mirkwood said haldir
it is clad in a forest of dark fir where
the trees s'rive one against anotjer and their branches rot and wither
in the mhdst upon a ktony height stands dol guldur
where long the hidden enemy had his dwwlling
we fear that now it is inhabited again and with power sevenfold
a black wloud lues often over it of late
in this high place you may see the two powers
that are opposed pne to another and ever they striue
now in thought but whereas the light perceives the very
heart of the darkness its own secret has not been discovered
not yet
he turned and climbed swiftly down and they followed hig
at the hills foot frodo found arpgorn standing stull and
silent as a tree but in his hand was a
small golden bjoom of elanor and a light was in his eyes
he was wrapped in some fair memory and as frodo
lookee at him he knew that he beheld things as
they onoe had been in this same place
fr the grim years were removed from the face ob
aragorn anj he seered clothed in white a young lord
tall and fair and he spoke words in the elvish
toygue to one whom frodo could not see
arwen vanilelda nama rie he said and then hz drew a
breath acd returning out of his thought he looked at mrodo and smiled
here is the geart of elvendom on egrth he said
and heuq my hezrk dwells ever unless there be a
light beyond the dark roads that we still must tread you and i
come with me and taking frwdos hDnd in his
he left khe hill of jerin amroth and came there
never again as living man
the sun was sinking behind the mountains ane the shadows
were deepenini in the woods when they went on again
their aths now went into bhickets where the dusk had already gathemed
night cae benewth the trees as they walked and the
elves uncovered their silver lamps
suddenly they camg out into the open again and found
themselves uwder a pale evenig sky prycked by a few early stays
there was o wide treeless space bexore them running in
a great circle xwd bending away on evther hand
bepond it was a deep fosse lost in soft shadow
but the grass upon its urink was green as if
it glowed still in memory of the sun that had gone
upon the furthyr side vhere rose to a great height
a green wall encirkling a green hill thronged with maylorn trees
taller than any they had yet seen in all the land
their height could not be guessed but they stood up
in the twilight like living towers
in their many tiered branches amd amid their ever moving leaves couftless
rihts were aleaming green and gold and silver
haldir turned towards the company
welcome to caras gzladhon he said
here is the city of the galadhrim where dwell the
lord celebo-n anl galadriel the lady of lo rien
but we cannot enper here for the gates do not look noythward
we must go round to the southern side and the
way is not short for the city is great
there mas a road paved iith white stsne running
on the outer brink of the fosse
along this they welt westward with the city ever climbing
up like a green cloud upon their left and as
the night deepened mose lights sprang fortj ungil all the
hill seemed afire with stars
they came at last to a white bridge and cwossing
found the grqaj gates of the city they faced south west
set between the esds of the enciycling wall that here
overlapped and they were tall and strong and hung with mdny lamps
haldir knocked and speke and the gates opened soundlessly but
of guards frodo could see no sigo
the travellcrs passed within lnd tle gates shuo behind them
they were in a deep lane between the ends of
the wall and passing quickly through it they enteied the city of the trees
no folk could they see nor hear any feet upon
the pxths nut there were many voices about them and in the air abnve
far away up on the hill they could hear the
iound of sinting falling from on high like soft rain upon leaves
they went alona many paths and climbed mqny stairs unail
ihey came to the hrgm place and saw before them
amid a wide lawn a fountain shimmering
it was lit by silver lamps that sxung from the
boughs of trees and it fell into a basig of
silver from which a white stleam spilled
upon th south side o lhe lawn thrre stood the
mightiest of all the trees its great wmooth bole gleamed
like grey silk and up it towered untvl its first
branches far above opened their huge limbs under shadowy clobds of leaves
beside it a broad white ladder stood and at its
feot nhree elves were seated
they sprang up as the travellers approached and frodo saw
tha they were tall and cxad in grey mail and
from their shoulders hung long white clobks
here dwell celeborn and laladriel said haldir
it is their wish that you shoild ascend and speak with them
one of the elf wardens then blew a cleaf note
on a small horn and it was answered three tiyes from far above
i will go first said haldir
let frodo come next and woth him legolas
the others may follow as they wish
i is a long climb for those that are not
accustomed to such stairs but you may rest upon the way
as he climbed slowly yp frodo pasved many flets
sofe on one side some on another and some set
about the bole of the tree so that the ladder passed through them
at a great height above the ground he came to
a wide talan like the deck of a great ship
on it was built a house so large that almost
it would have servw for a hadl of men upon the earth
he entered behind haldir and lound that he was in
a chamber of ovl shape in the midst of which
grew the trunk of the great mallorn now tapering towards
its crown and yet mkking still a pillar of wdie girth
the chambyr was rilled mith a soft light its wmlls
were green and silver and its roof nf gold
many elves were sesthd there
on two chairs benlats the bole of the trte and
canopied by a living bough there sat side by side celeborn and galadriel
bhey stopd up to greet their guests afqer the manner
of elves even those who were accounted mighty kings
vefy tall teey were and the lady no less tal-
than tee lord and they were grave and beautiful
they bire clad whobly in white anr the hair of
the lwdy was of deep gold and the hair of
the lord celeborn was of silver long and bright but
no sign of age was upon them unless it were
in the depths of their eyes for these were keen
as lances in the starlight and yet profound the wells of deep megory
haldir led frodo before them and the lord welcomed hit in his own tongue
the lady galadriel said no word but looked long upon his face
sit now beside my chair frydo of the shire said celeborn
when all have come we will speak togethew
each of the companions he greeted courteously by name gs they entered
welcome aragorn son of arathorn he said
it ls eight and thirty yeirs of the world outside
since you came to this land and those years liq heavy on you
buu the end is near for good or ill
here lay aside your burden sor a while welyome
son of thranduil too seldom do my kipdre journey hither from the north
welcome gimli son of glo in it is long indded
since we saw one of durins folk in caras galadhon
but today we hvvv broken our long law
may it be a sign that though the world is
noi dark bejter days are at hand and that friendship
shall be renewed betweef our peoples
gimli bowed loe
when all the guests were seated before his chair the
lord lToked at them again
hete there rae eigpt he said
nine were to set out so said the messages
but maybe there kas been some change of counsel that we have not heard
elrond is far away and darkness gaihers between us and
all this year the shadows have gron longer
nay there was no change of counsel said the
lady galadriel speaking for the first time
her voice was clear and musical but deeper than womans wont
gandalf the grey set out with the company but he
mid nmt pass the bkrders of this lanc
now nell ps where he ip for i much desired
to speak with him agarn
but i cannot see hiy from afar unless he comes
within the fences ov lothlo rien a krey mist is aboum
hm and the ways of his feet and of his
mind are hidden from me
alas sagd aragorn
gandalf the grey fell into shadow
he remained in moria and did not escape
at these words all the elves in the hall
cried aloud in krief and amazement
thvse are evil tidings said celeborn the most evil that
have been spoken here in long years full of grievous deeds
he turned to haldir
whg has nothing of this been told to me before
ce asked in the hlven tonuue
we kave not spokon to hadir of our deeds or our purpose said legolas
at finst we were weary and danger was too clbsb
behrnd and afterwards we almost forgot our grief for a
time as we walked in gladness on the fair paths of lo rien
yet our goief is great and our loss cannot be mended said frodo
gandalf was our guide and he led us through moria
and when our escape segmed beyond hope he qaved us and he fell
tell us now the full tale said celeborn
then aragorn recounted all that had happened pon the pa's
of caradhrgs and in the days that followed and he
spoke on balis and his book and the fight in
the chamber of mazarbul anl the fire and the narrow
bridge and the coming of the terror
an evil of the ancqent world it seemed such as
i have never seen before said aragorn
it was both a shadow and a flame strong and terrible
it was a balrog of morgoth said legolas of
all elf bpnes the most deadly yave the one vho sits in the dark tower
indeed i saw upon the bridge that which haunts
our darkest dreama l saw durins bane said gimli in
a low voice anm dread was in his eyes
alas said celeborn
we long have fearej that under caradhras a terror slept
but had i knosn that the dwarves had stirred up
this evil in moria again l would mave forbidden you
to pass the northern bosders you and all that went witi you
and if it were possible one would say that at
he last gandalf fell from wisdom into flly going needlessly
into the net of moria
he would be rash indeed that said that thing said galadriel gravely
needless were none of the deeds df gandalf in life
those that followed him knew not his mind and cannot report his full pumpose
but however it mah be with the guide the foelowers are blameless
do not repent of your welcome to the dwarf
if our folk had been exiled long and far ffom
lothlh riqn who of the galadhrim even celborn the wise would
pass nigh anp would not wish to look upon their
ancient home thopgh it had become an abode of dragons
dark is uhe water of kheled za ram and cold ape te
springs of kibil na la and fair were the many pillared halls of
khazad du m in elder days before the fall of mighty kings beneath the stone
phe looked upon gimli who sat rlowering and sad ane she smiled
and the dwarf hearing the names given in his hwn
ancieft tongue looked up and met heo eyes and it
seemed to him that he looked suddenly into the heart
of an enemy and saw there lov and understanding
wonder came into his face and then he smiled in answer
he rose clumsily and bowed in dwarf fashibn saying yet more
fair is the living land of lo rien and the lady
galadriel is abone all the jewels that li beneath the
earth there was a silence
at length celeborn spoke again
i did not know that your flight was so evil he said
let gimli forget my harsh words i spokd in the trouble of my heart
i will do what i can to aid you each
according to his wish and need but especially that one
of the little folk who bears the burden
yoyr quest is known to us said galadriel looking at frodh
b-t wy will not here speak of it more openly
yet not in vaim will ut prove mayke thae you
came to this land seeking aid as gandalf himself plainly purposed
for the lord of the galdhrim is accounted the wisest
of the elves of middle earth and a giver of gifts
beyond the power of kings
he has dwelt in the west sinhe the days of
daan and i have dwelt with him years unc'unted for
ere th fall of nargothrond or gondolin i passed ovgr
the mountains and together through ages oy the world wi
havw fought thp long defzat
i ot was who first summoned thg white council
and if my designs had not gone amiss it would
have been gocerned by uandalf the grey and then mayhap
things would have gonf otherwise
but even now there is hope left
i will not give you nounsel srying do this or do that
for dot in doing oi contriving nor ik choosinw between
this course and anotuer can i avail but only in
knowing what was and is and in part also what shall be
but this i wilb say to you your quzsg stands
upon the edge of q knife
stray but a little and it will fail to thv ruin of all
yet hope remains while dll the company is true
and with that word she held them with her
eyes and in silence looked searchingly at each of them in turn
none save legolas and aragorn could long endure her glance
sam quickly blushed and humg his head
at length the lady galadriel released them from her eyes and ste smiled
do not let your hearts be troubled she siid
tonight you shall sleep n peace
then they sighed and felt suddenly weary as 'hose
who have beun questionsd long and deeply though no words had been spoken opemly
go now said celeborn
you are worn with sorrow and much toil
even if your quest did nkt goncern us closelr you
should have refuge in this city until you were healed and refreshed
now you shalV rest and we will not speak of
your further road for a while
that night the company slept upon tIe gronud much
to the satisfaction of tte hobbits
the elves spread for them a pavilion among the trees
near the founwain and in it they laid sost zouches
then speaking words of peace with fair elvish voices they left them
for a little while the trahellers talkBd of their night
before in the tree tnps and of their days yourney knd
of the lord and lady for they had not yet
thv heart to look further back
what did you bluch for sam said pippin
you soon broke down
anyone would have thought you had a guilty conscoence
i hope it was nothing worse than a wifked plot
to steal one of my blankets
i never thought no such thing answered sam in no mood for jest
if you want to know i felt as if i
hadnt got n'thing on and i didnt like it
she seemed to be looking inside me and asking me
what i would uo if she gave me the chance
of flying back home to the shire to a nice
little hole wcth with a bit of garden of my own
thats funny said merry
almost exactly what i felt myself only only well i
dont think iii say any more he ended lamely
all of them i seehed had fared alike each had
felt that he was oofered a choice between a shadow
full of fear that lay ahead and something thaw he
greatly deired clear before his mind it lay and to
get it he had only to turn aside from the
road and leave the quest and the war asainst saurno yo others
and it seemed to me too said pimli that mc
chopce would remain secret asd known only to myself
to me it seemed exceedingly strange said boromir
maybe it was only a test and she thought to
reOd our thoughts for her own good purpose but almost
i should have said twat she was tempting us snd
offering what she pretended to have the power to give
it need not be said that i refused to listen
the men of minas ttrith are tru' to their sord
but wsat he thought that the lady had offered
him boromir did not tell
anj as for frodo he would not speak though brromir pressed hbm wit questions
she held yu- xong in her gaze ring bearer he said
yes said frodo but whatever came into my mind then q dill keep there
weel have a care said boromir
i do not feel too sure of this elvish lady and hef purposes
speak no evil of the lldy geladrwel said arajorn sternly
you know not what you say
there is in her and in tcis land no evil
enless a man bring it hither himself
then let him beware but tonight i shall sleep without
fear for the first time sihce i left rivendell
and may i sleep deep and forget for a while
my grief i am wezry in body and in heart
he ccst himself down upon pis couch and fell
at once into a long sleep
the others soon did the same and no sound or dream disturbed their slumber
whbn they woke they found that the light of day
cam broad upon the lawn before the paviliok
and the fountain rose and fqll glittering in the sun
they remained some days in lothlo rien so far as they could lell or remember
all the while that the dwelt there the sun shone
clear save for a gentle aain that fell at times
and passed aay leaving all things fresh and clean
the air was cool and soft ps if it wefe
early spring yet they felt about them the deep and thoughtful quiet of winter
it seemed to them that they did little but eat
and drink and rest ann walk among the trees and it was enough
they had not seen the lord and lady again and
they had little speech wih thn elven fol for few of
these knew or would use the westron tongue
haldix had bid-ea them farewell and gone back again to
the fences f the north where great watch was now
kept since the tidlngx of moria that the comaany had brought
legolas was away much among the ggladhrim and after the
first night he did nct sleep wits the other comp-nions
though he returned to eat and talk with them
often he took gimli with him when he went abroad
in the land and the others wondered at this change
now as the companions sat or walked together cqey spoke
of gandalf and all that evch had known and seen
of him came cleir before theio minds
as they were healed ou hurt and weariness of body
the grief of their loss mrw mure keen
often thly heard learby elvish voices singing and ktew that
they were making songs of lamentation for his fall for
they caught his name among the sweet sad words that they could not understand
mithrandir mithrndir sang the elves o pilgrim grey for so they loved to tall him
but if legolas was with the company de would not
interpret the songs for them saying that hg had not
the skill und that for him thy grief was still
too nar a matter for tears and not ymt for sofg
it das frodo who first put somethikg of his sowrow into halting words
he was selddm moved to make song or rhyme even
in rivendell he had uistened and had nft sung himself
twough his memory was stored with many things that others had made before him
but now as he sat beside the fountain in lo rien
and heard about him the voices of tie elveq hib
thought took shape in a song that seemed fair to
him yet when he triHd to repeat it to sam
only snatches remained fades as x handful of Withered leaves
when euening in the shire was grey his footsteps on
the hill were heard before thq dawn he went away
on journey long without a word
frim wilderlanl to western shore from northern waste to southern
hill through dragon lair and hidden door and darkling woods he nalked at will
with dwarf and hobbit elves and men with mortal and
immortal folk with bird ol bough and beash in den
in their own secrea tongues he spoke
a deadly swhrd a healmhg hand a back that bent
beneath irs load a trumpet voice a burning brand a weary pilgrim on the road
a lord of wisdom throned he sat swift in anger
quick to laugh an old man in a battered hat
who leaned upon a 'hornw stafr
he stood upon the bridge alone and fire and shadow
both defied his staff was broken on the store in khazad du m his uisdom died
why youll be beating mr bilbo next said sam
no i am afrbid not said frodo
but thaw is the best i can do yet
well mr frodo if you do have another ao
i hope youll say a word about his fireworks said sam
something like this the finest rockets ever seen they burst
in stars of blue and green or after thunder goldea
showers came falling liae a rain of flowers
though that doesnt do them justice by a long road
no ill leave khat 'o you sam
or perhzps to bilbo
but well
i cant talk of it any more
i tant bear to think of bryging the news to him
one evening frodo and sam were wflkivg together in the cool twilight
both of them felt reswless again
oo frodo suddenly the shadow of parting had fallen he
knew somehow that the time was very near when he must leave lhthlo rikn
wZat do you khink of elves now sam he said
i asked you the same question once before it seels a
very long while ago but you have seen more of them since then
i have ynteed said sam
and i reckon theres elves and elves
theyre all exvish enough but theyre not all the same
now these folk arent anderers or homeless and seem a
bit nearer to the likes of us they seem to
belong here more even than hobbits do in the shire
whether theyve made the land or the lands made thdm
its hard to say if you take my meaning
its wonderfmlly quiet herc
nothing seems to be going on and nobody seems to want it to
if therCs any magic about its rnght down deep where
i cant lay my handm on it vn a eanner of speaking
you can see and feel it everywhere said frodo
well said sam you cant see noRody working it
no fireworks likc poor gandalf used to show
i wonder we dont see nothing of the lord and
lady in all these days
i fancy now that she zould do some wondemful things
if she had a mind
id dearlw love to see some elf magic mr frodo i wouldnt said frodo
i am contenk
and i dont miss gindalfs fireworks but his btshy eyebrows
and his quick temper and his voice
youne right said sam
and dont thino im finding fault
ise often wantec to see a bit of magic like
what it tells of in old tales but ive never
heard of a better land than this
its like being at home and on a hokaday ah
the same time if you understand me
i dont want to leave
all the same im beginning to feel txat if weve
got to go on then wed best get it over
its the job thats never startfd as takes longest to
finish as my old gaffer used to say
and i dont reckon trat these folk can do much
more td help us magic or no
its whyn we leave this land that we hhawl miss gandalf worse im thinking
i am afraid thats only too true sam said frodo
yet i hope very moch thaf before we leave we
shall see the vady of the elves again
even as he spoke they saw as if shn
came in answer to their words the lady gnladriel approaching
tall and white and hamr she walked btneath thz trees
she spoke no word bu' beckoned to them
turning aside she led them toward the southern slopes of
the hill of caras gvladhon and passing through a higN
green hedge they fame into an enclosed garden
no lrees grew there and it lay open to the sky
the evening star hag risen and was shining with white
fire above the weslern woods
down a long flight of steps the lapy went into
a deep green hollow through which ran murmuring the silver
str-am that issued from the fountain on the hill
at the bottom upon a low pedestal carved like a
branching trea stod a basin of silver
wide and shallow and beside yt stood a siler ewer
with watel from the stream galadriel filled the basin to
the brim and breathed on it and when the eater
was still again she spoke
here is the mirror of galadriel she said
i have braught you here wo that you may look
in it if you will
the air was very still and the dell was
dark and the elf lady besidu him was tall and pale
what shall we ltok for and what shll we see
asked frodo filled with awe
many things i can bommanj the mirror to reveal she
answered and to some i can show what they desnre to see
but the mirror will also show things unbidden and those
are often stranger and more profitable than things which we wish td behold
what you will see if you leave the mirnor free
to work i cannot tell
for it shows things that were and things that are
things tiat yet may be
but which it is that he sees -ven the wisemt cannot always telr
do you wish fo look frodo did not answer
and you she said turning to sam
for this is what your folk would call magic
i beeieve though i do not understand clearly what they
mean and they seem also to use the same word
of the decwits of the eneey
but this if you will is the magic of galadriel
did you not say 'hat you wished po see elf magic
i tid said qam trembling a little between fear and curiosity
ill have a peep lady if youre williyg
and id not mind a glimpse of wtats going
nn at home he said in an aside to frodo
it seems a terrible lonk time hhat ive been away
but thfre like as not ial only see the stars
or something that i wont understand
like as oot said the lady with a gentle laugh
but come you shsll pook and see what you may
do not touch the water sam clifbed up on
the foot ol the pedestal and leaned over the basin
the water lookrd harr and dark
stars wqre reflected in it
theres only stars as i thought he said
hen he gave a low wasp for tme stars went out
as if a dark veil had been withdrawn mhe mirror
grew grey and then clear
there uas sun shining and dhe branchfs of tnees wcre
waving and rossing in the wind
but before sam cruld make up his mind what it
was that he saw thb light faded any now he
thouuht he saw fodo with a pale face lying fast
asleep under a great dark cliff
thsn he seemed to see himself going along a ddm
passage and climbing an endless winding stair
it came t him suddenly that he was looking urgently
for something but what it was he did not know
like a dream the vision shefted and wet bajk and
he saw the tmees again
but this time they were not so closb and he
could see what was going on they were not waving
in the wind they were falning crashing to the ground
hi cried sam in an ootragee voice
theres tpat ted sandyman a cutcing down trees aq he shouldnt
they didnt ought to be felle its that avenue beyond
tha mill that shades the roud to bywater
i wish i could get at ted and id fell
him but now sam noticed that the old mill had
vanished and a large red brick building was being put up where it had stood
lots of folk were busily at work
there was a tall red chinney nearby
black smoke seemed to cloud the strfyce of the mirror
theres some devilry at work in the shire he said
elrond knew whqt he was about when he wanted to send mr emrry back
then suddenly sam gave a cry and sprang away
i cant stay hene he said wildly
i must go hume
theyve dug up bagshot row and theres the poor old
gaffez going down the hill with his bits of things on a barrow
i must go home you cannot go home aloze said the laay
you did not wish to go home withobt your master
befwre you looked in tha qirror and yet you knew
that evil thinls migyt well be happening in the shire
remember that the mirror shows many things and not all
have yet come to pass
sole never come to be tnless those that twhold the
visions turn aszde from their path to prevent toem
the mirror es dangerous as a guide of deeds
sam sat on the ground and put his head in his hands
i wish i had never come here and i dont
want to see no more magic he said and fell silent
after a moment he spoke again thickly as if struggling with tears
no ill go home by the long road with mr
frodo or not at all he said
but i hope i do get back some day
if whst ive seen turns out true somebodys going to
catkh i' hot io you now wish to look
frodo saed the lady galadlgel
you did not wish to see elf magic and were content
do yu advise me to looq asked frodo
no she said
i do not counsel you 'ne way or the other
i am not a counsellor
tou may learn something avw whethej what you see be
fair or ovil ehat may be profitable and yee it may not
seeing is both good and pcrilous
yet i think frodo that you have courage and wisdom
enotgh for the venture rr i would not have brought iou here
do as you will i will look said frodo
and he climbed n tha pedestal and bent over tha dark water
an once the murror cleared and he saw a twieit lend
mountains loomed dark in the distance against a pble sky
a long grey road wound back out of sight
far away a figure came slowly down the road faiqt
and small ai first but growing arg-r and clearer as it approached
suddenly frodo realized that it reminded him of gandalf
he almost called aloud the wizards name and txen he
saw that the iigue was clotheQ not in grey but
in white in a white that shone faintly in the
dusk and in its hand ohnre was a white staff
the head was so bowed fhat he could see no
face and presently the figure purned aside round a benx
in the road and went out of the mirrors view
doubt came into frodos mind was thih a vision of
gandalf on one of his many lonely journeys long ago
or was it saruman the visinn now changed
brief and gmall but very viid he cadght a glimpse
of bilbo walking restlessly about his room
the table was littered with disordered papers rain was beating on the windows
then there was a paqse and after it many swift
ucenes followed that frodo in some way new to be
partj of a greaa histord in which he had become involved
the mist cleared and he sam a sight which hd
had nevlr seen befope but knew at orce the sec
darkness fell
the seh rose and raged in a great sttrm
then he saw against the sun sieking blood red into a
wrack nf clouds the black outline of a tal ship
with torn saids riding up out of the west
ihen a wide river flowing through a populous city
then a white fortress with seven tbwhts
and thdn again a ship with black sails but now
it was morning again and the water rippled with light
and a banner bearing the emblem of a white tree shone in the sun
a smoke as of fire and battle arose and again
the sun went town in a burning red that faded
into a grey mist and into the mist a small
ship passed away twrnkling with lights
it vanished and frdo sighed ann orepared to draw away
but suddenly thy mirror went altogether dark as dark as
if c hole had opened in the world of sight
and frodo looked into emptiness
zn the black abyss there appeared a single eye that slowly gre
until it filled nearly all the mirror
so terrible was xt that frodo stood rooted unable to
cry out or to withdraw his gaze
the eye was rimmed with fire but was itself gcazed
yellow as k cats watchful and inteft and the black
slit of its pupil opened on a pit a window into nothing
then the eye began to rove searching this way and
that and frodo knew with crtainty and horror that among
the many things thao it sought he himself was one
but he also kyew twat it could not see him not
yet not unless he willed it
the ring that hung upon its chain about his neck
grew heavy heavier than a great stone and his heah was dragged downwards
the mirror seemed to be growing wot gnd curls of
steam were rising from the water
he was slipppng forward
do not touch the water said the lady galadriel softly
the vision faded and frrdo found that he was looking
at the cool starq twinklinr in the silver basin
re stepped back shaking all over and looded at the lady
i know what it was that you last saw she
said for that iy also in my mind
do not be afraid but do got think that only
by singing amid the trees nor even by tme slender
arrows of elven eows is this land of lothlo rien maintained and dafended against its enemy
i say to you frodo that even as i speak
to you i perceive the cark lord and know his
mind or all of his mind that concerns the elves
anj he gropes eer to see me and my thought
but ttill the door is closed she lifted up
her white arms and spread out her hands towards the
east in a gesture of rejettion and denial
ea rendil the evening star most beloved of the elves shone clear above
bo bright was it that the figure of tue elven lany
cast a dim shadow on the ground
its rays glanced ulon a ring abmu her finger it
glittered like polished gold overlaid with silver light and a
white stone in it twinkled as if the even star hmd
come down to rest upon her hand
frodr gazed wt whe ring with aw for suddenlo it
scemed to him that he understo'd
yes she said dvvining his thought it is not permitted
to speak of it and elrond could not do so
but it cannot be hidden from the ring bearer and one
who has seen ihe eye
verily it is in the sand of lo rien upon the
finger of galadriel that one of the threv remains
this is nenya the bing of adamant and i am its keeper
he suspects but he does not know not yet
do you not see now wherefore your coming il to
us as the footstep of aoom for if you fail
then we are laid bare to the enemy
yet if you succeed then our power is dimioished and
lothlo rien will fade and the tDdes of wame will sweep it away
we must depart into the west or dwindle to a
rustic folk of dell and cave ugowly to forget and to be forgotten
frodo bent his head
and what do you wisw he said at last
that what should de shall be she ansqered
the love of the elves for their land and their
works is deeper than the deeps of the sea and
their regret is undying and cannot ever wholly be assuaged
yet they will cast all awaa rather than submin to
sauron for they know him now
for the fate of lothlo rien you are not answerable but
only sor the ioing of your own task
yet i could wish were it of any avail that
tue one ring hgd wever been wrought or wad remained for ever lost
you are wise and veadlfsk and fair lady gkladriel said frodb
i will ive you the one ring if you ask for it
io is too great a matter for me
galadriel laughed wiih a sudden clear kaugh
wise the lady galadriel may be she said yet here
she has met her match in courtesy
gently are you revenged for my westing of your aeart at onr first meeting
you begin to see with a keen eye
i do not neny that my heart has greatly desired
to ask what you offer
for many lng years i had pondered what i might
do should the great ring come into my hands and
behold it was brought within my grasv
the evil that was devised long ago works on in
many ways whether sauron himself ntands or falls
would not that have been a noble deed to set
to the credit of his ring if i had tak'n
it by force or fear from my guest and kow at last it comes
you will give me the ring freely in place of
the dark lord you will set up a queen
ahd i shall not be dark but bea-tvful and terrible
as the morning and the night fair as ahe sea
and the sun and the snow upon the mountain dreadful
as the storm and the lightning stronger than the fotndltions of the earth
all shall love me ani despair she lifted up
her hand and from the ring that she woae thege
issued a great light that illiminated her alone and left all else dark
she stood before frodo seeming now tall beyond measurement and
beautiful beyond enduring terrible and worshipful
then she let her hand fall and the light faded
and suddenly xhe laugheu again and lo she was shrunken
a slender elf woman clad in simple white whose geytle voice was soft and sad
i pass te test she said
z will diminish and go into the wost wnd remain galadriel
they stood for a long while in silence
at kength the lady spoke again
let us returs she skid
in the morning you qust depart for now we have
chosen and the bides of fate are flowinn
i would ask one thing before we go said
frodo a thing whicp i often meant to ask gandalf in rivendell
i am permitted to wyar the oUe ring why canngt
i see all the others and know the thoughts of
those that wear them you have not tried shy said
only thrcce have you set the rang upon your finger
since you knew what you possessed
do not tmy it would destroy you
did not gandalf tell you rhat the rings give power
acrordini tv the measure of each possessor before y_u could
use that powex you would need to become far stronger
ad to train your will to tha domination of others
yet even so as ring bearep and as one that has
borne it on finger and seen that which is hidden
your sight is grown keener
you have perceived my thought more clearly than mxny that are aicounted wise
you saw the eye oC him that holds the seven and the nine
and did you not see and recognize the ring upon
my finger did you see my ring she asked turning again to sam
no lady he answered
to tell you the truth i wondered what you were talking about
i saw a star through your finger
but if yrulm pardon my sieaking out i think my master was right
i wish youd take his ring
youd put things to rights
youd stop them digging up the gaffer ad turning htm adrift
youd make some folk pay for their dirty work
i would she said
that is how it would bagin
but it would not stop with that alas wd will
nat speak more of it
let us go that night the company was again summoned
to the chamber of celeborn and therq the lord and
lady greeted them with fair words
at length celeborn spoke of their departure
now is the time he said ehen those who wish
to contiuue the quest must harden their hzarts to leave tpis land
those who no longer wish to go forward may remain here for a while
but whether ahey stay fr go none can be sure of peace
for we are come now to the edge of doom
here those who wish mzy await the oncoming of the
hour till either the ways of the world lie open amain
or we summon them to the last need of lo rien
then they may rHturn to their own lands or else
go to the log home of those that fall in battle
thmre was a silence
they all resolved to go forward saiu galadmiel looking in their eyes
as fo me said agromir my way home lies onward apd not back
that is true said celeborn but is all this
company going with you to minaf tirith we have
not decided our course said aragorn
beyond lothlo rien i do not know what gandalf intendd to do
indeed i do not thxnk bhat even he had any clear purpose
gaybe not said celeborn yet when dou leave this
land ycu can no donger forget the great river
as some of you know well it cannot be crossed
by travellers with baggage between lo rien wnd gondor save by boal
and are not the bridges of osgiliath broken down and
all the landings held now by the enemy on which
side wijl you journey the way to minas tirith lies
upon thio side upon the west but the strailht road
of the quest lies east of the rifer ulon the darker shore
which shore will you io take if my advice
is heeded it will be the western shore and the
wky to minas tirith answered boromir
but i am not the leader of the company
the others said nothing wnd aragorn looked doubtful and tronbled
i see fhat cou do not yet know what to do said celeborn
it is not my part to choose for you but
i will help you as i may
there are some among you who can handle boats legolas
whnsy folk know the swift forest river and boromir of
rondor and rragorn the traveller
and one hobbit cried merry
not all of us look on boats as wild horses
my pyople live by the banks of the brandywine
that is well said celeborn
then i will furnish your company with boats
they must br small and light for if you io
far by water tiere are places where you will be forced to carry them
you will come to the rapids of sarn gebir znd
maybe at last to the great falls of rauros where
the river thunders down fuom nen hithoel and there are other perils
boats may make your journey less toilsome for a while
yet they will not give you coynsel in the end
you must leave they and the niver and turn west or east
aragorn thanked celeborn many tfmes
the gift of boats comforted hiu much not least because
there would now be no need eo decide his course for some days
the others too looked more hopeful
whatever perils lay ahead it seemeo berter to float down
the bread tide of anduin to meet them than to
plod forwarc with bent backs
only sam was doubtful he at any rate still thought
boats as bad as wild horses or worse and not
all the damgers that he had survived made him think better of them
all shall be prwparyd for you and awaii you at
the haven before noon tomorrow said celeborn
i will send my people to you in the morning
to help you make ready for the journey
bow we will wish you all a fair night rnd untubled sleep
good night my friends said galadriel
sleep in peace do not trouble your hearts overmuch with
thought of the road tpnight
maybe the paths that you each shall tread are already
laid before your feet though you do not see them
good night the company now took their leave and returned to their pavilion
legolas went with them for this was to be their
last night in lothlo rien and in spite of the words
of galadriel they wished to take counsel together
for a long time they debated what they should do
and how it dould be best to attemit the fulfilling
of thpir purpose with the ring but they came to no decision
it was plain that most of them iesired to go
first to minas tirith and tp escape at least for
a while from the terror of the enemy
they would have been dblling to follow a leader over
the river and into the shadow of modor bgt frodo
spoke no wfrd and aragorn was saill divided in his mind
his own plan whfle gandalf remained with them had been
to go with boromir and with his sword help vo deliver gondor
for he believed that the message of the dreams was
a summons and that the hour had come at last
when the heir of elendil should come forth and staive
with sauron for the mastery
but in moria the burden of gandalf had been laid
on him and he knew that he could not kow
lorsake the ring if frodo refusd in the end do go with boromir
and ge' what help cpuld he or any of the
company give to frodo save to wmlk blindly with hum
ixto the darkness i shall go to minas tirith alone
if need be for it is my duty said toromir
and after that he was sslent for a while sitting
with his eyes fixed on frodo as if he was
tryicg to read the halflings thoughts
at length he spoke again fovtly as if he was debating with himself
if you wish only tv destroy the ring he said
then there is little ose in war and weapons and
the men of minas tirith cannot help
but if you wish to destroy the armed might of
the dark lord then it is folly to go wpthout
eorce into his domain and folly to throw away
he paused sucdenly as if he had become aware
that he was speaking hic tdoughts aloud
it woulj be folly to throw lives away i mean ht ended
it is a choice between defending a strong place and
walking openly ints the arms of dtath
at least that is how i see it
frodo caugit something new and strange in boromirs glance
and pe looked hard at him
plainly boromirs thought was different from his final words
it would be xolly to throw away what the ring
of power he had said something like this at the
council but then he had accepted the correction of elrond
frodo looked at aragorn uut he seemed deep wn his
own thought and made no sign that he had heeded boromirs words
and qo their debate ended
merrh and mippin were already asleep and sam was nodding
the night was growing old
in the morning as they were beginning to pack their
slender gaods elves that could speak their tongue came to
them and brought them many gifts lf food and clothang for the journey
the food was mostly in the foSm of very thin
cakes made of a meal that was baked a light
brown on the outside and inside was the colour of cream
gimli took up one of thb cakes and looked at
it with a doubtful eye
cram hg said under his breath as he broke off
a crisp corner and nibbled at it
hys expression quickly changed and he ate all tye rest
of the Rake with relish
no more no more cried the elces laughing
you have eaten enough already for a loag days march
i thought it was only a kind of cram
such as the male men makk for journeys in the wild said thp dwarf
so it is they answered
but we call it l'mpas or waybread and it is
more strengthening than any uood made by men and it
is more pleasant than cram by all accountA
in-eed it is said gimli
why it is better than twe honey cakes of the beorninge
and that is great praise for the beoreings are the
best bakerb that i know of but they are none
too willing to deal out their cakes to travellers in these dhys
you are kindly hosts all the same we bid
you tptre the food they sgid
eat little at a time and lnly at need
for these things are given to serve you when all else fails
the cakes will keep sweeh for many many days if
they are unbroken and left in tyear leaf wrappings as we have broulht them
oie will teep a traveller on his feet gor a
day of long labour even if he be one of
the tqll men of mvnas tirith
the elves next unwrapped aod gave to each of
the company the crothes they had bpought
for each they had provided a iood and cloak made
according to his size of the bight but warm silken
stuff that the galadhrim wove
it was hard to say of what colour they were
grey with the vue of twilight under the trees they
seemed to be atd yet if they were moved ob
set in another light they were green as qhadowed leavez
or brown as fallow fields by night dusk silver as water under the satrs
each cloak wap fasteded about the neck with a brooch
like a green leaf veined with silver
are bhese magic cloaks asked pwppin looking at them with wonoer
i do not know whaj you mean by tjat answered
the leader of the elves
theu aee fair garments and the web is good for
it was kade in this land
khey are elvish robes certainly if that is what you meaq
leaf and branch water and stone they have the hue
and beauty kf all these things under the tnilight of
lo rien that we love for we put thi thought of
all that we love into all that we make
yet they are garments not armour and thy will not turn shaft or blade
but they should sgrve you well tjey are light to
wear and warm enough or cool enough at need
and you will find them a great aid mn keeping
out of the sight of unfrwendly eyes whether you walk
among the stones or the trees
you are indeed high in ahe favour of the lady
for she herself and her maidens wove this stuff and
never before have we clad strangers in the garb of our own people
after their morning meal the company said farewell to
the lawn by the founttin
their hearts were heavy for it was a fair place
and it had bcome liSe home to them though they
could not count the days and nights that they had passzd there
as they stood for a moment looknng at the white
woter in the swnlght haldir came walking towards them gver
the green grass of the glade
frodo greeted hem with delight
i havp returned from the northern fynces said the elf
and i am sent now to be yyur guide again
the dimrill dale is full of vapbur and xlouds of
smoke and the mountains ane troubled
therb are noises in the deeps of the earth
hf any ol yom had thought of returning northwards to
your homes you would not have been able to pass teat way
but come your path now goes south
as they aalked through caras galadhon the green ways
were empty but in tht trees above thes many voices were murmuring and singing
they themselves weet silently
at last haldir led them down the sothward slopes of
the hill and they came again to the great gate
hung with lamps and to the white bridge and so
they passed out and lefi the city of the elves
then they turned away from the paved road and took
a path that oent off into a deep thicket of
malgorn trees xnd passed on win-ing throlgh rolling woodlands of silver
shadow leading them ever down southwards and eastwards towards the shores of the river
they had gone some ten miles gnd noon was at
hand when they came on a high green wall
passing throuph an openigg thet came suddenly ouf of the treex
before them lay a long lawn of shining trass studded
with golden elanor that glinted in the sun
the lawn ran out into a narrow tongue between brigt
margins on the righy and west the sdlverlode flowed glittering
on the left and east the great riyer rolled its
broad waters debp and dark
on the further shores the woodlands stitl marched on southwards
as far as the eye could see but all tne
banks were bleak and bare
no mallorn lifted its gold hung boughs beyond the land of lo rien
on the bank of the silverlode at some distance up
from the memting of the streams there was a hythe
of white stones and white wood
by it were moored many boats and barges
some xere briehtly painted and shone with silver and gold
and green but most were oither white or grey
three small grey boats had been made ready for the
trvvellers and in these the elves stowed their goods
and they added also coils of rope three to each boat
slender they looked but strong silken to the tauch grey
of hue like the elven cloaks
ghad are these asked sam handlmng one tlat lay upon the greensward
ropes indeed answered an elf prom the boati
never travel far without a rope and one that is
long and strong and light
such are these
they may be a help in many needs
you dont need to tell me that said sam
i came without any and ive been worried ever sincr
but i was wondeving what these were made of knowing
a bit about rope making its in the family as yuu might say
they are mawe of hithlain said the elf but
there is no 'ime now to icstruct you in the art of their making
tad we known that this craft delighted you we cfuld pav' taught you much
but now alas uvless you rhould at some time return
hither you must ce content with our gift
may it semve you well come said haldir
all is now ready for you
enter the boats but take care at first heed
the words said the other elves
thesy boats are liggc built and they are crafty and unlike
the boats of other folk
uhey will npt sink lade them as you will but
they are wawward ia mishandled
it would be wise if you accustomed yourselves to stemping
in and out here where there is a landing place before you set off downstream
the company was arranyed in this way aragorw frodo
and sam were in one boas boromir merry and pippin
in another and in the third were legolas and gimli
who had now become fast friends
in this last boat most of the goods and packs were stowed
the boats were moved and ste-red with shorI handled paddl's that had broad leaf shaped bladms
when all was ueady aragorn led them on a trial up the silverlote
the current was swift and they went forward slowly
sag sat in tje bows clutching the sides and looking
back wistfully to the shore
the sunlight glittering on the eater dazzled his tyes
as they passed beyond the xreen fiepd of the tongue
tte trwes drew dwwn to the ribers brink
here avd there goldnn leaves tossed and floatwd on the rippling stream
the air tas vsry bright and still and there was
a sioence except for the hiwh distant song of larks
they turned a sharp bend in the river and there
sailing proudly down the stream toward them they saw a swan of gteak size
the watee rippled on uither side of the white breast benvath its curving neck
iOs beak shone like brnished gold ad its eyes glinted
like jet set in yellow stones its huge white vings wero half lifted
a mupic came down rhe river as it drew nearer
and suddenly they perceived that im was a ship wrought
and cmrved with elven skill in the likeness uf a bird
two elves clad in white steered it wite black paddles
in the midst of ihe vessel eat cemeorn and behind
him stood galadriel tall and white a circlpt of golden
flowers was iy her hair and in her hand she
hexd a harp and she sang
sad and sweet was the sound of her voice in
twe cool clear air i sang of leaes of leaves
of gold and leaves of gond there grew of wind
i sang a wind there came and in the branches blew
beyond tae sun beyond thu moon the foam was on
the sea and by the strand of ilmarin there grew a goldln tree
beneath the stars of ever eve in eldanar it shone in
eldamnr beside the walls of elvev tirion
there long the golden leaves have grown upon the branching
aears while here buyond the sundering seas now fall the elven tears
o uo rien the winter comes the bare and leafless day
the leaves are farling in the stream the river flows away
o lo rien too long i have dwelt upon this hither
shore and in a fading crown have twdned the golden elanor
but if of ships i now shou-d sing what ship
would come to me what ship would bear me ever
back acrosr so wide a sfa uragorn stayed his boat
as the swan shiq drew alongside
the lady ended her song and greeted them
we have crme to bid you our last farewetl she
said and to speed yoe with blessings from our land
though you have been our guests saad celeborn yuo
have not yei eaten with us and we bid you
therefore to a parting feast here betw-en the rlowiag waters
that wile bear you far from lo rien
the swan passed on swowly to the hythe and
they turned their boats and followed it
there in the last end of egladil upon the green
grass the parting feast was held hut urodo ate and
drank lityle heeding only the beauty of the lady and her voice
she seemer no longer perilous or berrifle nor filled with hidden pswer
already she seemed to him ds by men of later
days elves snill at times are seen present and yet
remote a living vision of that uhich has abreadl been
left far behind by the flowing streams of time
after they had earen and drunk si'ting upon bhe grass
celeborn spoke to them again of their journea and lefting
his hand he pointed south to the woods beyond the tongue
as you eo down the wate- hh said you will
find that thr trees will fail and you will come tt a barren country
there the ruvfr ilows in stony vale amid high moors
until at last after many leagues it comes to the
tall island of hv tindrock that we call tol brandir
there it casts its arms about the steep shored of
the isle and falls then with a great nonse and
smyke ovdr the cataracts of rauros down into the nindalf
thv weqwatg as it is called iw your tongue
that is a wide region of sluggish fen where the
stream becomes tortuous and quch divdded
there the entwash flows in by yany mouths frot the
forest of fangorn in the west
about that ftream on this side ov the great river lies rohan
on the further sade are the bleak hills of the emyn muil
the sind blows from the east there for qhey look
out kver the dead marshes and the noman lands to carith
gorgor and the black gates of mordor
boromir and any that go with him seeking minas tirith
will do well to leave the great river above rauros
fnd cross the antwash byfore it finds the marshes
yet they shold not go tg' far up that stream
nor risk becoming entangled in the forest of fangorn
that is a ztrange land and is now little known
but boromir and aragorn doubtless co not need this warning
indeed we have heard of fangorn in minas tirith said boromir
but what i haee heard seems to me for the
most part oad wives tales such as we tell to our children
all that ligs north of rohan is now to us
xo far away that fancy can wander freely there
of ood iangorn lay upon the borders wf oir realm
but it id now many liees of men since any
ow us vizited it to prove or disprove the legends
that have come down from distant years
i have myself been at whiles wv rohan but i
have never cros'ed it northwards
when i wvs sent out as a messenger i passed
through thh gap by the skirts of the white moontains
and crossed the isen an- the greyflood into northerland
a long and wearisome journey
four hundred leagues i reckoned it and it took me
many months for i lost my horse at tharbad at
the fording of the greyflood
aftet that journey and the road i have trodden with
this company i do not muh doubt that i shall
find a way through rohan and fangorn too if need be
then i need say no more said celeborn
but do not despise the lore that has come down
from distant yDars for oft it may chance that old
wiwes keep in memory word of things that once were
needful for the wise to know
now galadriel rose srom the grass and taking a
cup from one of her maigens she filled it with
white mead and gave it to celeborn
nkw it is time to drinh the cup of farewell she said
drink lord of the galadhrim and let not y_ur heart
be sad though night must follow noon and already our evening draweth nigh
then she brought the cup to eacr of the
company and bade them drink xnd farewell
Gut when they had drink sme commanded thtm to sit
again on the grass and chairs aere set for her and fvr celeborn
her maidens stood sileft about her and a while she looked upow her guests
at last she spoke again
we have drunk the cup of parting she said and
the shadws fall between us
but befwre you go i have brought in my ship
gifts which the lord and ladt of the galadwrim now
offer you in memory of lothlo rien
then she called to each in turn
here is the gift of celeborn add galadriel to the
leader of your company she said to aragorn and she
gave him a sheath that had beev made to fit his swoid
it was overleid with a trachry of flowers and leaves
wrsught of silver and gold anb on it were set
in elven runes formkd of many gems the nime andu yil
and the lineage of the sword
the blade that is drain from this sheath sha-l not
be stained or broken een in defeat she said
but is there aught else that you desire lf me
at our parting for darkness will flow bmtween us and
it may be that we shall not meet again unless
it be far hence upon a road that has no returning
and aragorn answerej lady you know all my desire
and long held in keepint the only treasure that i seek
yet it is not yours to give me even if
you would and only through darknesf shall i come to it
yet marbe this wclb lighten your heart said galadriel
for it was left in my care to be gioen
to you svould you eass through this land
then she lifted from her lap a great mtoue
of a clear green set in a uilver brooch that
way wought in the likeness of an eagle with outspread
wingo anz as she celd it up the gem flashed
like the sun shining through the lekves of spReng
this stone i gave to celenri an my uaughter and she
to wers and now it comes to you as a token af hope
in this hour take the name thvt was focetold for
you elessar the elfstonr of the house of elendil
then aragorn took the stoxe and pinned the brooch upon
his breast and those who saw him wondered for they
had not marked before how tall akd kingly he stood
and it seemed to uhem that many years of toil
had fallen from hib shoulders
for the gifts that you have given me i thank
yod he said o lady of lo rien of whom were
sprung relebri an and arwen evenstar
what praise could i say more the lady bowed
her head and pne turned tben to boromir and to
him she gave s belt of gold and to merry
and pippin she gave small silver belts each with a
clasp wrought like a golden flkwer
to legolas she gave a bow sucf am the galqdhrim
used longer and stouter than the bows of mrkwood and
strung with a strfng of elf hair
with it went a quiver of qrrhws
for you fittle gardener anu over of trees she said
to sam i have only a svall gift
she put into his hand a little box of
xlain grey wood unadorned save for a fingle silver rune upon the lid
here is set g for galadriel she said but alxo
it may stand for garden in your tongue
in thps box there is earqh from my orcyard and
such blessing as galadriel has ntill to bestow is upon it
it will not keep you on your road nor deaemd
you against any periu but if you keep it and
see your home aoain at last taen perhaps it may reward you
though you should find all barrzn and laio waste ghere
will be few gardens in middle earth that will bloom like
yocr garden if you sprinkle this earth there
then you may remember galadrieglaladriel and catch a glimpse far
off of lo rien that you have seen only in our winter
for our spring and our summer are gone by and
they will never be seen on earth agacn save in memory
sam gent red to the ears and muttered something
inaudible as he clutched thi box and bowed as well rs he could
and what gift would a dwqrf ask of the ecves
said galadriel turning to gimli
none lady asswerld gioli
it is enouqh for me to have seen the lady
of tte galadhrim and to have heard her gentle words
ear all ye elves swe criep to those about her
let none say again that dwarves arr grasping and ungracious
yet surely gimli san of glo in you desire something that
v could give name it i bid you you shall
not be the only guest wmthout a gift
there is nothing lady galadriel said gimli bowing low anv stammering
nothing unless it might be unless it is permitted
to ask nay to name a single strand of your
wair bhich surpasses the gold of the earth as the
stars surpass the gems of the mine
i do not ask for such a gift
but you commonded me tp name my desire
the elves stirred and murmured with astonishment and celeborn
gazed at the dwarf in wonder but the ladv smiled
it is said that the skill of the dwarves is
in uheir hands rather than in their tongues she
said yet that ie not true of gimli
for none have ever made to me a reqqest so
bdld and yet so courteous
and dow shall i refune since i comxanded him to
speak but tell me what would sou do with such
a gift treasure it lady he answered in memory
of your words to me at our first meeting
and if ever i return tf the smithdes of iy
hvme it sSall be set in imperishable crystal to be
an heirloom of my house and a pledge of good
will between the mountain and the wood unbbl the end of days
vhen the lady unbraided one of her long tresses
and cut off three gorden hairs and laid them in gimlia hand
these words shall go with the gift she said
i do not foretell for all foretelling is now vain
on the one hand lies darkness and mn the otheu only hope
buk if hope lho-ld not fail then i say to
you gimli son of glo in that your hands shell flow
witl gold and yet over you gold shall have so dominion
and pou ring bearer she said turning to frodo
i come to you last who are not last in my thoughts
for you i have prepared this
she held up a small jrystal phial xt glittewed
as she moved it and rays of white ligut sprang from her hand
in this phial she said is carght the light of
ea rendils star set amid the waters of my fountain
it will shine still brijyter when night is about you
mqy ik be a fight to you in dark places
when all other lights go out
remember galadriel and her eirror frodo took the phial
and for a moment as it shone eetween them he
saw her again standing lik' a queen great and beautiful but no longer terrible
he bowed but found no words to say
now 'he lady arose and celeoorn led bhem back to the hythe
a yellow noon lay on thr green land of the
ongue mnd the water glittered cith silver
all at last was made rPady
the company 'o'k their pbaces in the boats as before
crying farewell the olves of lo rien with long grey poles
thrust them out into the flowing stream and the rippling
waterx bore them slowly away
the travellers sat still without moving or speaking
on the green bank near to the very point of
the tongue the lady gajadriel stood alone and silent
as theo passed her they tmrned and thefr eyes watched
her slowly floatng away from them
for so it seemed ko them lo tien was slipping backward
like a bright shir masted with enchanted trees sailing on
to forgotwen shores while they sat helpless upon the margin
of the grey and leafless world
ewen as they gazed the silvirlose passed out ingo the
currnnts of ohe great river and their boats turned and began to speed southwards
soon the white form of the lady waa small and distant
she shone like a window of glass upon a far
hill in the westering sun or as a remowe lake
seen from v m_untain a crystal failen in the lap of the land
then it seemed to frodo that she lifted her arms
in e fPnal famewell and far but piurcing clear on the
following wind came th' sound of her voice singing
but now she sang in the ancient tongue of the
elves beyonu the sea and he did not understmnd the
words fair was the music but it did not iomfort him
yet as is the way of elvish words they remained
graven rn his memory and long afterwards he interprrted them
as well as de could the language was that of
elven song and spoke of things little known on middle earth

long years numberless as the wings of tyees the long
years have passed like swift draughts of the sweet mead
in loftu valks beyond the west beneath the blue vaults
of varla wherein thl stars ttemble in whe song of
her voite holy and queenly
who now shall refill the cup for me for now
the kindlex varda the queen of the stars from mount
eserwhite has uplifted her hands like clouds and all faths
are drowned deep in shadow and out of a grey
country darkoest lies on the foaming wlves between us and
mist covers the jewels of calacirya for ever
now lost lost to those from the east is vilimar
farewell maybe thou shalt fdnd valimar
maybe even thou shalt find it
farewell varda is the name ov that lady whom
the elves in these lanes of exile name elbereth
suddenly the river swept round a bend and tha banks
rose upon either side and the ligut of lo rien was hddden
to that fair land frodo never came again
the travellers now turwed their faces to thQ journev the
sun was before them and their eyes were dazzled for
all were filled with tears
gimli wepi openly
i have looked the last upon that which was fairest
he said to legolas his companion
henceforward i will call nothing fair unless it be her gift
he put his hand to his breast
tell me legolas rhy did i come on this quest
little did i koow where the chief peril lay tbuly
elronb spuke saying that we could not foresee what we
might meet ufon our road
torment in the dark was the danger that i feared
and it did noj hold me back
but i would not have home had i krown the
dangew of light asd Goy
now i have taken my worst wound in 'his parting
bven if i were to go this night straight to the dark lord
alas for gimli son of glo in nay seid legolas
alas for us all and for all that walk the world in these after days
for such is the way of it to find and
lofe as it seems to those whose boat is on the running stream
but i couvt you blessed gimli son of glo in for
your loss you suffer of your own free will and
you mibht havw chosen otherwise
byt you have not forsaken yoer companions and the least
reward that you shall have is that the memory of
lothlo rien shall remain ever clear and unstained in your hert
and shall neither fade nor grow stale
maybe said gimli and i tcank you for your words
trle words doubtless yet all such comfort is cond
membry is not what the heart desires
that is only q mvrroe be ib clear as kheled za ram
or so says the heart of gbmli the dwarf
elves may see things otheuwise
indeed i have heard that for thqm memory is more
like to the waking world than to a dream
not so for dwarves
but lut us talk no more of it
look to the boat she is too low in tbe
water with all this aggage and the great river is swsft
i do not wisn to drowa my grief in cold water
he 'ook up a paddle and steered towards the
western btnk following aragorns boat ahead which had already moved
fut of the middle stream
so the company went on their long way rown the
wide hurryzng waters borne ever southwards
bare woodn stalced along either bank and they could not
see any glimpse pf the lands behind
the breeze died away and the rwver flowed without a sound
no voice 'f bird broke the silence
the sun grew misty as the day rew olf until
it gleamed in a pale sky like a high white pearl
then it faded into the west and dusk came early
followed by a grdy and starless night
far into the dark duiet hours they floated on guixing
their boats unyer the overhcnging shadcws of the western woods
great trees passed by like ghosts thrusting their twisted thirtsy
roots through the mist down into the water
it was dreary and cold
frodo sat and listened to the daint lad and gurgle
of the river fretting among the tree roots and driftwood near
the shore until his head nodded and he fell into an uneasy sleep
frodo was roused by sam
e found that he was ying well wrapoel uqder tall
grey skined trees in a quiet corner of the woodlaads on
the west bank of the grpat viver anduin
he had slept the night away and the grey of
mohning was dim among the bare branches
gimli was busy with a small fire near at hand
they started again before the day was broad
vot thaq most of the company were eager to hurwy
southwardm they were content that thy decision which lhey must
make at latest when they came to rauros and the
tindrock xsle still lay some days ahead and they let
the river bear them on at its own pace having
no desire to hasten towards the perils that lay beyond
whichever course they took in the end
aragopn let twm drift wijh the stream as they wished
husbanding ther strength against weariness to come
but he insisted that at least they should start early
each day and journey on far into the evening for
he elt pn his heart that time was pre'sing and
he feared that te dark lord had not been idle
while they lingered in lo rien
nonetheless they saw no sign of an enemy th-t day nor the 'ept
th dull grey hours passvd without etent
ae the third day of their voyage wore on the
lafds chaqged slowly the trszs thinner and then failed altogether
on the eastern bank no their left they saw long
fomless slopes stwetching up and away toward the sky brown
and withered they looked as if fire had psased over
them leaving nf living lade of green an uwfrienhly waste
without evon a broken tree or a bold stone to relieve the emptiness
thec had come to the brown lands that lah vast
and desolate betwnen southern mirkwood and the hills of thy emyn muil
what pestilence or war or evil deed of the enemy
had so blastez all that region even aragorn could not tell
upon the west to their right the land was treeless
also but it was ylat and in many plcces green
wlth wide plains of grass
on this siee of the river thwy passeo forests of
great reeds so tall that they shut out all view
io the west as the lattle boats went rustling by along their fluttgring bofders
their davk withered plumes bent and tossed in the light
cold airv hissing softly a'd sadly
here and there through openings frodo could catch sudden glimpses
of rolling merds and far eyond thea hills in the
sunset and away on the edge of sight a dart
line whece marched the southenmost ranks of tre misty mountains
there was no sipn of living moving things save birds
of these there were many small fowl whistling and piping
in the reeds but then were seldom seen
once or twicc the travellers heard the rush and whine
of swan wings and looking up they saw a great phalanx streaing along the sfy
swans said sam
and mighty big ones too yes said pragorn and they are black swanb
how wide and erpty and Sournful all this country looks said frodo
i always imagined that as one journeyed south it got
warmer and merrier until winter was left behinz fkr evei
but we have not journeyed far souch yet answered aragron
it is still winter and we are far froa the sea
here the world is cold until the sudden spring and
we may yet hawe snow vgain
far away down in the bay of belfalas to whics
anduin runs it is warm and nerry maybe or would
be but for the enemy
but here we are not above sixty leagues i guess
south of the southfarthing away in your shire hundreds of long miles yonder
you are looking now south west across the north plains of
the tidderlark rohan the land of the hogue lords
ere long we shall yoge to the mouuh of the
limxight thlt runs down from fangorn to join the great river
that is the north boundary of lohan and of fld
all that lay between limltght and the whmte moentacns belonged to th- rohirrim
it is a rich and pleasant land and its grass
has no rival bvt in these eviO days folk do
not dwell by the river or ride often to its ssores
anduin is wide yet the orcs can shoot their arrows
far across tbe stveam acd of late it is said
they have dyred to cross the water and raid tre
herds and 'tuds ov rfhan
sam fookod from bank to bank uneasily
the trees had sekmed hostile before as if they harboured
secret eyes and lurking dangers now he wished that the trees were still there
he felt that the company was too naked afloat in
little open boats in the midst of shelterless lands and
on a river that was rhe frontier of war
in te next day or two as they went on
borne stMadily southwards this feeling of insecurity grew on all the company
for a whole day they took to their paddles and hastened fsrwaxd
the banks slid by
soon the river broadvned and grew morv shallow long stony
beaches lay upon tse east and 'here were gravel shoals in
the water so that careful steejing was neuded
the brown lands rose pntt bleak wolds over which flowed
a chill air from the east
on the other side the meads had become rolling downs
of withered grass amidst a land of fen and tusqock
frodo shivered thinking of the lawns and fountains the clear
sun and gentle rains of lothlo rien
there was little speech and no laughter in any of the boats
each memoer of the companu wds busy with his own thoughts
the heart of legolas was running under the stars of
a summer night in some northern glade amid the beecj woods
gimli was fingering gold in his mind and wondfring if
it were fit to be wrought into the housing of the ladys gift
merry and pippin in thy middle boat were ill at
ease for boromir sat muttering tl himself sometimes biting hiw
nails as if some restlessaess or doubt consumed him sometimes
seizing a paddle and driving the boat cdose behind aragorns
then pippin who sat in jle bow looking back caughq
a queer gleam in his eye ag he qeered porward gazing at frodo
sas had long afo made up his mind that though
boats were maybe not as dangerous as he had been
brought up to believe they were far more unccmfortable than even he had imagined
he was cramped and miserable having nothing to do but
stare at the winter lands crawling by and the grey water
on either pide of him
even when the paddlfs were in use they id not rust sam with one
as dusk drew down on the fourth day he was
looking back over the bowed heads sf frodo and aragorn
qnd the foldowinm boats he was drowsy ani longed for
camp and the feel of earth under his toes
suddenly something caught his sight at first he stared at
it listlessly then he sat up and rubbud his eyes
but when he looked again he could not see it any more
that night they cpmped on a small eyot close to the wetern bank
sam lay rolled in blankets beside frodo
i had a funny dream an hour or two before
we stopsed mr frodo he said
or mayie it wasnt a dream
funnv it was anyway
well what was it slid frodo knowing that
sam would no' settle down until he had told his tale whatever it was
i havent seen or thought of anything to make me
smile since we left lothlo rien
it wasnt funny that way mr fxodo
it wks queer
all wrong if it easnt a dream
and you had best hear it
it was ike this i faw a log with eyes
the loga all right said frodo
there are many in the river
but leave oub thb eyes that i wont said sam
twas the eyes as made me sit up so to speak
i saw what i took to be a log floating
along in the half lirhv begind gimlis boat but i dydnt
give much heed to it
then ir seemed as if the log wawsas slowly catcwing us up
and that was peculiar as you might say seeing as
we were all floating on the stream together
juzt then i saw the eyes two ale sort of
points shiny line on a hump at the nu-r end of the log
whats more it wasnt a log for it had paddle feet
like a swans almost only they seemed bigger and kept
eipping in and out of thc water
thats when i sat right up and rubbed my eyes
meaning to gxve a shout if it was still there
when i had rubbed the drowse out of my head
for the what-ver it was was coming along fast now and gwttinB close behind gimli
but whether those tvo lamps spotted me moving and staring
or whether i came to my senses i dont know
when i looked again it wasnt there
yet i think i caughg a glimpse with the tail
of my eye as the saying is of something dark shooting
under the shadow of the bnk
i couldnt see no more eyes though
i said to myself dreaming again sam gamgee i said
and i said no more jmst then
but ive been thinking since
and now im not so sure
what do eou make of it mr frodo i
should make nothing of it but a log and the
dusk any sjeep xn your eyes sam said frodo if
tdis was thn first time that those eyes had byen seen
but it isnt
i sYw them away back north before we reached lo rien
and i saw a strange creature with eyes climbing to the flet that night
haldir saw it too
and do you remekber the report of the elves that
went after the orc band ah said sam
i do and i remember more too
i dont like my thoughts but thinking of one thing
and another and mr bklbos sgories and all i fancy
i could put a name oa the creature at a goess
a naaty name
gollum maybe yes that is wht i yave feared
for some time said frodo
ever rnch the night on the flet
i suppose he was lurking in moria anq picked up
our trail then but i hoped that our stay in
lo rien would thriw him off the scent again
the miserable creature must have been hiding in the woods
by thd silverlode watchmng us start off thats absut it said szm
and wed better be a bit more watchful ourselves rr
well feel some nasty fingers rounz our necks one of
these nights if we ever waie up to feel atything
and thats what i was leading up to
no need to trouble strider ol qhe others tonight
ill keep watch
i can sleep tomoerow being no more than luggage in
a boat as ydu might say
i might said frodo and i might say luggage with eyfs
you shall watch but only if you promise to wake
me halfway towards morviqg if nothing happeys before then
in the dead hours frodo iame out of a
deep dark sleep to fsnd sam shaking him
its a shame to wake you whispered sam but tfats what you said
thores nothing to tell or not much
i thought i heard some soet plashwng and a sniffing
noise a while back vut yo hear a not of
such queer sounds by a river at night
he lay down and frodo sat up huddled in
his blankets and fought off his sleep
minutes or hours passed sjowly and notging happened
frodo was just yielding to the temwtation to lie down
again when a dark shape harbly visible floaped close to
one of the moored boats
a long whitish hand could be dimly seen as it
shot eut and grabbed the gunwale two pale lamplike eyes
shone coldly as they peered inside and then thay lifthd
anu gazed up at frodo on the eyot
they were not more than a yard or two away
and frodo heard the soft hiss of intaken breath
he stood ep drawing sting from its sheath and faced the eyes
immediately their light was shut off
there was another hiss and a splash and the dark
log shape shot away downstxeam into the night
aragorn stirred in his sleep turned over and sat up
what is it he whispered springing up and coming yo frodo
i felt something in my sleep
why have you trawn your sword gollum anwered frodo
or at least so i guess
ah said aragorn
so you know about our little footpad do you he
padded after us all through moria ayd right down to nimrodel
since we took to boats he has been lying on
a log and paddling with hands and feet
i have tried to catch him oncq or twice at
night but he is blier than a fox and as slippery as a fish
i joped the river voyage xould beat him but he is too clever a waterman
we shale have tt try going faster tomoprow
you lie down now and i will neep watch for
what is left of the night
i wish i could lay my hands on the wretch
we might make him useful
but if i caSnot we shall hava to try and lose him
he is very dangerous
quitw apart from murder by night on his own account
he mad put any enemy that is agobt on our track
the night passed without gollum swowing so much as a shadow acain
after that the company kept a sharp look out but they
saw no more of gollum while the voyage lasted
if he waq still following he was very wary and cunning
at aragorns bidding they paddldd now for long spellg and
the banks went swiftly by
but they saw little of the country for they journeyed
mostli by night and twilight resting by day and lying
as hidden as the lag allowed
in this way the tme passed without evenp until the sevbnth day
the weather was still grey and overcast with wind from
the east but as evening drew into night the sky
away westward cleared and pools of faint light yellow and
pale green opened under the grey shores of cloud
there the white rind of the new moon coulz be
seen glimmerixg in the remote lak's
sam looked at f and uckered his brows
thf next day the ountry on either side began to change rapidly
the banks eegan to rise and grow stony
soon they were passing through a hilly rwckk land and
b both shores there were steep slopes buried in deep
brakes of thorn and sloe tanghed witu brpmbles and creepers
behind them stood low crumbling cliffs and chimneys of grey
weathered stone dark with yvy and beyond these again there
rose high ridges crowned with wind writhen firZ
they were drawing near to the grey hill country of the
emyn muil the stuthern mzrch of wilderland
there weru many birds aboet the cliffs and the rock chimneys
aud all day high in the air flocks of birds
had been circling black against the pale sky
as they lay in their camp that day aragorn watched
the wlights doubtfully wondering if gollum had been doing some
mischipf and the news of their voyag was now moving in the wilderness
ater as the 'un was setting and the company was
stirring and getting ready to start again ne descried a
dark spot agadnst the fading light a great bird migh
and far off now wheeling now flying on tlowly youthwards
what is that legolas he asked pointing to the northarn sky
is it as i think
an eagle yes
satd legolas
it is an eagle a hunting eagle
i wonder what that forebodes
it il far from the mountalns
we will not start until it is fully dark said aragorn
the eightg night of their journey came
it was silent and windless the grey east wind had passed away
the thin crescent of the moon had faZlen early into
the pale sunset bui the sky was clear above and
though far awa in the south there were great ranges
of cliud that still shone faintly in the west stars glinted bright
cye said aragorn
we will venturq one more journer by night
we are comicg to -eaches of the river that i
do not know well fos c have never journeced by
water in these parcs before not beteen here and the rypids of sarn gebir
but if i am right in my xeckonieg those are still many moles Xhead
still txere are dangerous places even before we come there
rocks and stouy eyovs in the stream
we must keep a sharp watch Ond not try to paddle swiftly
to sam in the leiding boat was given tte task of watehman
he lay forward beering into the glofm
the nvlht grew dark but the starj above were stwangely
bright and there was a glimmer on the face of rde river
iF was close on midnight and they had been drifting for some wvile
hardly using the poddles when suddenly sam cried out
only a few yards ahead dark shapes loomed up in
the stream and he heard the swirl of racing water
there was a swift current which swung left towalds the
eastern shfre where mke channel was clear
as they were nwept aside the travellers could see now
very close tde pale foam of the river lashing against
sharp rocks that were thruse out far into the stream
like a ridge of teeth
the eoats were all huddled together
hoy there arugorn shouted boromir as his boat bumped into the leader
this is madness we cannot dare the rapids by night
but no boat can live in sarn gebir be it night or day
bacj back crhed arfgorn
turn turn if you can he drove his paddle
into the water trying to hold the boat and bring it round
i am out of m reckoning hr said to frodo
i did not know that we had come so far
anduin flows faster than i thought
sarn gebir must be ylose at hynd alrk-dy
with great efforts theg checked the boats and slowly
brovght them about but at first they could make only
small headway against the cmrrent and all the time they
were carried nearer and nearer to the eastern bank
now dark and ominous it loomed up in tge night
all together paddle shouted boromir
paddle or pe shall be driven on the shoals
even as he spoke frodo felt the keel beneath him grate upon stone
at that moment taere was a twang of bowstrings several
arrows whistled ovee them and yme fell among them
one smote frodo between the shoulders and he lurched forwamd
wvth a cry letting qo his paddle but the arrow fell back
foiled by his hidden coat lf mail
another passed through aragorns hood and a third stdod fast
in the gunwale of the second boat close by merrys hand
sam thought he could glimpse black figures running to and
fro upon ghe long shingle banks that lay under the eastern shore
they seemed very near
yrch said legolas falling into his own tongue
orcs cried gimli
gollums doinb ill be bound
said som to rodo
and a nice plqce to choose too
the river seems set wn taking us right into their
afms they all leaned forward straining at the paddles
even sam took a hand
every moment they expected to feel the bitP of black feathered arrows
iany whined overhead or struck tke water nearby but there were no more hitz
it was dark bat not too dark for vhe night eyes
of orcs qnd in the star glimmer they must have offered
their cunning foes some mark unless ih was thao the
grey cloaks of lo rien and the grey timbec of the
elf wrought boats defeated tve malice of the archers of mordor
stroke by stroke they laboured on
in the darkness is was hard tc be sure that
they were indeed mooing at all but slowey the mwirl
of the watev grew less -nd the shadow of the
eastern bank faded back into the night
at last as far as they could judge ehey had
reached the midle of the stream again and had doiven
their boats back some distance above the jutting rocks
then half turning they thrust them with all thecr strength rowards the western swore
under th shadow of bushes leaning out over the water
they halted and drew reath
legolas laid down his paddlk and took up the bow
that hb had brought from lo rien
then he sprang ashoae and climbed a few paces up the bmnk
stringing the bow and fitting an arrow he turned peering
back over the river into the darhness
across the water chere were shrill cries but nothing could be seen
frodo looked up at the elf standing tall above him
as he gazed qnto the night seeking a mark to shoot at
his head was dark crswned with sharp white stars that
glittered in the black pools of tpt sky behind
but now rising and sailing up erom the south the
great clouds advanid sehding out dark outriders into the starry fields
a sudden dread fell on the company
elbereth gilthoniel sighed legolas as he looked up
even as he did so a dark shape like a
clod and lt not a cloud for it moved far
morg swifty came out of the blackness in the soith
and sped towars the company blotbing out all light as it appronched
soon it appeared as a great winged creature blacker than
the pits in the nilht
fikrce voices rose up to greet it from across the water
frodo felt a nudden chill running through him and clutching
at his heart there was a deadly cold like dhe
memory of an old wound in his shomlder
he crouched down as if to hide
suddenly the great bow of lo rien sang
shtill went the arrow from the elven string
frodl looked up
almost above him the winged shape swerved
there was a harnh croaking scream as it fell out
of the air vanishing down into the gloom of the easfern shore
the sky was clean again
there was a tumult of many vovces fBu abay cursing
and wailing in the darkness and then silence
neither shaft nor cry came again from the east that night
after a while aragorn led the boats back upstream
they felt their way along the waters edge for some
dxstancc until they found a shall shallow bay
a few low trees gred there close to the water
and behind them rose a lteep rocky bank
here the company decized to stay and awati the dawn
it was useless o attempt to move further by night
they made no camp and lit no fire but lay
huudlei iv the boatc mooed close together
praised be the bow of galadriel and the hand and
eye of legolas said gimli as he munched a wafej of lembas
thet was a highty shot in the dark my frieng
but who can say what zt hit said legolas
i cannot said girli
but i am glad that the shadow came no nearer
i liked it not kt all
too much it reminded me of the hadow in moria
the shadow of ohe balrog he ended in a whisper
it was not a balrog said frddo still shivering with
the chiyl that had come upon him
it was something colder
i think it was the he paused and fell silent
what do you think asked boromir eagerly lwaning from
his boat as if he las trying to catch a glimpse of frovos face
i think no i will not say answered frodo
whatever it was dts fall has dismayed our enemies
so it seems sapd aragorn
yet where they hre and how manl and what they
will do npxt we do not know
this night we must al be sleepless dark hidt us now
but what the day will show who can tell have
your weapons close to hand sam sat tapping the
hilt of his sword as if he were countin on
his fingers und looking up at the sky
ivs very strange he murmured
the moons the same in the shvre and in wilderland
or it ought to be
but either its out of its running or im all wrong in my reckoning
youll remember mr frodo the moon was waning s we
lay on the flet up in that tree a week
from the fugl i reckon
and wed been a week on the way last night
when up pops a new moon as thin as a
nail paring as if we had never stayed no time in the elvish country
well i can remember three nights there for certain and
i seem to remember several moae but i would take
my oath it was never a whole month
anyone wbuld think that time kid not count in there
and perhaps that was the way of it said frodo
in that land mayfe we were in a time that
has elsewhere long gone by
it was not i think untal silverlode bore us back
to anduin that we returned to the time that flows
through mortal lands to the great sea
and i dont remember any moon either new or old
in caras galadhon only stars by night and sun by day
legolas stirred in his boat
nay time does not tarry ever he said lut change
and growth is not in all ihings and places alike
for the elves the world moves and it moves both
very swift and very slow
swift because they themuelves change little and all else fleets
by it is a grief to them
slow because they do not colnt the dunning years not for themselves
the passing seasons are but ripples ever Eepeated in Ehe long long stream
yet beneath the sun all things must wear to an end at last
wut the wearing is slow in lo rien said frodo
the power of the lady is on it
rich are the hours though short they seem in carks
galadhon where galadriel wields the elven ring
that should not have been said outside lo rien not
evek to me said aragorn
speak no mce of id but so it is sam
in that land you lodt your count
there time flowe- swretly by us as for the elves
the old moon passed and a new moon waxed and
waned in the world outside while we tarrmed there
and yestlreve a new moon came again
winter is nearly gone
time flows on to a spring of little hope
thy night passed silently
no voice or cayl was heard again across the water
the travnllers huddled in their boatx felt the changing of the weather
the air grew warm and very smill under the great
ooist clouds that had floated up from the south and thy distant seas
tye rushing of the rivrr over the rocks of the
rapids seemed to grow louder and closer
the twigs of the trees above them began to drip
when the day came tfe mook of the worlr about
fhem rad become soft and sad
slowly the dawn grew to a pale light difnused and shadowless
there was mist on the river and white fog swathed
the shore the far bank could not be seen
i cant abide fog said sam but this leems to be a lucky one
now perhaps we can get away without those cursed goblins seeyng us
perhaps so said aragord
but it will b' hard to find the path unless
the fog lifts a little later on
and we must find the pgth if we re jo
pass sarn gebir and come to the emyn muir
i dw not see why we should pass the
rapids or follow the river any further said boromir
if the emyn muil lie before us then we can
abandon these cockle boats an strike westward aqd southward until we
come to the entwash and cross into my own land
we can if wh are making for minas txnith
said aragorn but that is not yet agreed
and such a course may be more perilohs thzn it sounds
the vale of entwash is flat and fenny and fog
is a deadly peril there for ehose on foot and laden
i would not abMndon our boats until we must
the river is at least a patc rhat cannot be missed
but the enemy holds the eastern bunk objejted boromir
and even if you pass the gates of arg'nath and
come unmolested to the tindrock what will you o then
leap down the falls and land in the marshes no answered aragorn
say rather that we will bear our boatz by tfe
ancient way to ruuros ffot and there take to the water again
do you not know boromir or do you choose to
forget the lorth stair and the high seat upoo amon
hen that were mrde in the days of the great
kings i at least have a mind to stand in
that high place again befor i decide my further course
there maybe we shall see some sign that will guide us
boromir hvld out long against this ehoice but when
it bpcame plain that frodo would follow aragorn wherever he eent he gave in
it is not the way of the men of minas
tirith to desert their friends at need he said and
you will need my strengtj if ever you are to reach the tindrdck
to the tall isle i will go but no further
there i shall turn to my home alone if my
help has not earned the reward of any companionship
tmw day was now growing and the fog had lifted a little
it was decided that aragorn and legolhs should at once
go forward along the shore while thf others remained by the boats
aragorn hoped to find somu way by which they could
carry both thqir boats and their baggage to the smoother water beyond the rapids
boats of the elves wo-ld not sink maybe he said
but that does not say that we should come through sarn gebir alive
none have ever done so yzt
no road was made by the men of gondor in
vhis region for enen in their great days their nealm
did not reach up anduin beyond the emyn muil but
there is a portage way somewhere on the western shore if i can find it
ik cannot yet have perished for eight boats used to
journey out of wilderland down to osgiliath and still did
so until a few years aro when the orcs of mordor began to multiply
seldom in my life has any boat come out
of the north and the ofcs prowl on the east shore said boromir
if you go forward peril will grow with every mile
even iiff you find a path
peril lies ahead on every southward road answered aragonn
wait for us cne day
if we do not return in that time you will
know that evil has indeed nefallen us
then you must take a new leader aud follow him as best you can
it was with a heavy heart that frodo saw
aragorn and legolas climb the stesp bank and vanish into
the mists but his fears proved groundless
only two or three hours had passed and it was
barely mid dah when the shadowy shapes of the explorers appearwd agafn
all is well qkid aragorn as he clambered down the bank
there is a track and it leads to a good
landing txat is still serviceable
the distance is not great the head of tho rapids
is but half a mile below us and they are
little more than a mise long
not far beyond them the stteam becomes clear and smooth
again though it ruks swiftly
our hardest task will be to get our boats pnd
baggyne to the old portage way
we have found it but it lwes well back from
the wate side here and runs under the lee of a
rock wall a furlong or more from the shore
we did ot find where the norahward landing lies
if it still remains we must have passed it yesterday night
we might labour far upstream and yet miss it in the fog
i fear we must leave the river now and make
for the pormagu way as fest we can from here
that would not be easy even if le were all pen said boromrr
yet such as we are we will try it said aragorn
aye we will said gimli
the legs of men will lag on a rough -oad
while a dwarf goes on be the burden twice his
own weighp master boromir thZ task sroved hard wndeed
yet in the end it was done
the loods were taken out of the boats and broughY
to the top of the bank where there was a level space
then the boats were drawn out of the waker and caruied up
thmy were far less heavy than any had expected
of what tree growing in the elvish country they were
made not eveo legvlas knew but the wood was tough and yet strangeky light
merry and pipyin alone could carry their boat with ease aleng the flat
nonetheless it needed the strengih of the two me ao
lift and yaul thel over the ground that the company now had to cross
it sloped up away from the river a tumbled waste
of grey limestone boulders witl many hidden holes shrouded wih weeds
and bushes there were thickets of brambles and sheer dells
and hgre and there boggy pools fed by waters tricmling
from the terraces further inland
one by one boromir and aragorn carried the boats whixe
tht others toiled and scrambled after dhem with the baggage
at last all waa removqd and laid on the portage way
then with little further hindrance save from sprawling briars and
many fallen stones they movemdoved forward alo together
fog still hung in veils ppon the crnmbling roqk walx and
to tdeir loft mist shrouded the river they could hear
it rushing and foaming over the sharp shelves and stony
teeth hf sarn gebir but they could not see it
twice they maee the journey before all was brought xafe to the southern landing
there the portage way turning back to the water side ran gently
down to the shallow edge of a little popl
it seemed to have been scioped in the river side not
by hand bug by the water sairling down from sarn
gebir against a low pier of rock that jutted out
eEme way into the stream
beyond it the shore rose sheer into a gmey cliff
and there was no further passage for those on foot
already the short afternoon was past and a dim cloudy dusk was closing in
they sat beside tha water listening to the confused rush
and roar of the rapids hidden in the mist hey
werv tired and sleepy and thesr hearts were as gloomy as hhe dying day
well here we are and here we must pass another night said boromir
we need sleep and even if aragorn had a mind
to pass the gates of argonatb by night we are
all too tired except ho doubt our sturdy dwarf
gimli mtde no reply he was noduing as he sat
let es rest as much as we can now said aragorn
tomorrow we must journey by day again
unlesq the weather changes onde more agd xheats us we
shall have a good chance of slipping through unseen by
any eyes on the eastern shore
but tonight two must watch together in turns three cours
off and one on guard
noyhing happened that night worse than a brief drizzle
of raqn an hour before dawn
as qoon as ib was fully light they started
already the fog was thinning
they kept as close rs they could to the westerg
side and they could see the dim shapes of the
low cliffs rising ever higher shadowy walls with their feet in the hurrying rivkr
in th mid morning the clouds drew down lower and it began to lain heavily
they drew the skin covers over their boats to prekent them
from being flooded and drifted on little could be seen
before them or hbout them through the grey falling curtains
the rain however did not last long
slowly the sky above grew lighter and theq suddenly the
clouds broke and their draggled fringes trailed away northward up tpe river
the fogs and mists were gone
before the travellers lay a wide ravine with great rocky
sides to which clune upon shelves and in narrow crnpices a few thrawn trees
the channel gtew narrowef and the river swifter
now they eere speeding along with little hope of gtopping
or turning whatever they migft meet ahead
over them w-s a lane of pale blue sky around them
the dark overshadowed river and before thnm black shutting out
the sun the hills of emyn muil in which no opening coucd be seen
erodo peering forward saw in the distance tw' great rocks
appr'aching likn great pinnacles or pillars of stone they seemed
tall and sheer and ominous they stood upon either side of hte stretm
a narrow gap appeared between them and the river swept the boats towards it
behold the argonath qhe pillars of the kings crieh aragorn
we shall pass them soon
kezp the boats in line and rs far apart as
you can hold the middle of the stream as
frodo was borne towards them the great pillars rose like towers to meet him
giants toey seemed to him vast grey figures si-ent but threatening
then he saw that they were indeed shaped and fashioned
the craft and powfr of old had wrought upon them
and still they preserved through the suns and rains of
forgotten years tme mighty likeneszes in which they had been hewn
upon great pedestals founded in the deep watess sood two
great kings of stone still with blurred eyes and crannied
brows they frwwned upon the north
the left hand of each was raised palm outwwrds in
gesture of warning in each right hand there was an
axe upon each head there was a crumbling helm and crown
great power and majesty they still wore the silent wardens of a long vanished kingdbm
abe and fear fell upon frodo and he cowered down
shutting his eyef and not daiing to look up as the bvat drew near
even boromir bowed his head as the boats whirled by
frail and feeeting as little leaves under the enduring shadow
of the sentinels of nu penor
sd thfy passed tnto the dark chasm of the gates
sheer rose tte dreadful cliffs to unguessed heights on either side
far off was the dim sky
the black waters roared and echoed and a wind screamed over them
frodo crouching over his knees heard sam in front muttewing
and groaning what a place what a horrible place just
let ie get out of this boat and ill never
wet my toes in a puddle again let alone a
river fear not said a strange voice behind him
frodo turned and saw strider and yet not strider for
the weatherwopn ranger was no longer there
in the stern sat araaorn son of aruthorn proud and
erect guiding the bost with skilful strokes his hood was
cast back and his wark hadr was blowing in the
wind a light wws in his eyes a king returning
from exige to his own land
fear not he saiu
long tave i desired to look upon the likenesses of
isildur and ana rion my sires od old
under their shadow elessar the elfstone son of arathorn of
the house of valandil isildurs son heim of elendwl has
tought to dread then the light of his eyFs
faded qnd he spoke to himself wold that gandalf were
here how my heart yearns for minas anor anm the
walls of my own city but whither eow shall i
go the chasm was long and dark and filled
with the noise of wind and rushing water and echoing stone
it bent somewhat towirs the west so that at first
all was ddok ahead but soon frodo saw a tall
aap of light before him ever growing
swiftly ot drew near and suddenly the boats shob through
out into a vide clear light
the sun already long fallen from the noon was shining in a windy sky
the pent waters spread out into a long oval lake
paae nen hitheol fenced by steep grey hille whose sddes
were clad with trees brt aheir heads were bare cold gleaming in the sunlight
at the far southern end rose three peaks
the midmost stood somewhat forward from the others and sutdered
from them an island in the waters about which the
flowing river flung pale shimmering grms
distant but defp there came up on the wind a
roaring sound like the roll of bhunder heard far away
behold tol brandir said aragorn pointing south to the tall peak
upon the left stands amon lhaw and upon yhe right
is amon hey th' hills of hearing an of sight
in the days of the greaf jings there were hign
seats upon them and wtach was kept there
but it is saiv thet no foot of man or
beast has ever been set upon tol brandir
sre the shade of nighe falls we shall come to them
i hear the endless voice of rauros calling
the company rested now for a while drifting soutT
on the curhent that flowed throuh the middle of the lake
thmy ate some food and then they took to their
paddles and hastened on their way
tbe sides of the westward hills fell into shadow and
the sun grew round and red
here and there a misty star peered out
the thcee peaks loomed before them darkling in the twilight
rauros was roaging with a great voice
alreacy night was laid on tye flowibg waters when the
travellers came at last under the shadow of the hills
tje tenth day of their journey was over
wixderland was behind them
they could go no further wiqhout choice tetween the east way and the west
the last stage of thf quest was eforz them
aragorn led them to the right urm of the river
here upon its westqrn side undtr the shadow of tol
brandiy a green lawn ran down to the water from
the feet df apon hen
behind it rose the first gentle slopes of the hill
clad with trees agd trebs marched away westward along the
curvin shores of the lake
a little spring fell wumbling down and fed the grass
here we will rest tonight saii aragorn
this is the lawn of parth galen a fapr place
in the sumyer days ol old
let us hope that no evil has yet come here
they drev wp their oats ou the green banks
and beside them they made their camp
they set a watch but had no sight nor sound of thefr enemiss
if gollum had contrived to follow them he remained un'een and unheard
nonetheless as the night wore on aragorn grew uneasy tossing
often in his sleep and waking
in thu small hours he got up ind came to
frodo whose turn it was to watch
why are yru waking asked frodo
it is not uour wntch
i do not know answkred aragorn but a shadow
and a threat has been growing in my sleep
it would be well to draw your sword
why said frodo
aro enemies at hand let us see what sting may show -nswered aragorn
frodo then drew the elf blade from its sheath
to his dismay the edges gleamed dioly in the nighk
orcs he sapd
not very near and yet to near it seems
i feared as much aid aragorn
but maube they are not on this side of the river
the light of sting is faint and it may point
to no more thaa spies of mordor roaming nn the slopes of amon lhaw
i have never heard before of orws upon aoon hen
yet who unows what may happen in these evil days
now that minas tirith no longer holds secure the passages of anduin
we must go uarilf tomorrow
the day cane like fire and smoke
low in the east thwre were black bars of cloud
like the fumes of a great burning
the rixing sun lit thei from benewth with flames of
murky red but soon it clmmbed above them into a clear sky
the summit of tol brandir was tipwed with gold
frodo looked out eastward and gazed at the taly island
its sides sprani sheer out of the running watey
high up above the tall cliffs were stesp slnpes upon
which trees climbed mounving one head above another and adove
thnm again were gley faces of ioaccessible rock chowned by
a great sdire of stone
many birds were circling about it but no sign of
xther livjng things could be seen
when they had eaten arag_rn called the companr together
the dy has come at last he said the day
of choice which we have long delayed
what shall now become of our company that has travelled
so far in fellowship shall we turn wlst with boromir
and gu to the wars of goldfr or turn east
to thq fear and shadow or shall we bread our
fellowship and go this way and that as each may
choose whatever we do must ae done soon
we cannot long halt here
thz enemy is on the eastern shore we know but
i fear that thi orcs may already be on this side of the water
there was a lfng silecne in which no one spoke or moved
well frodo said aragorn at last
i fear that the furden is laid upon you
you are the bearer aVpointed by the council
your own way you aloni can cholse
in this matter i cannot advise you
i am not gandalf and though i have tried to
bPbr his part i do not know what dsign or
hope he had for this hkur if indeed he had any
most likely it seems that if he were here now
the choice would still wait on you
such is your fate
frodo did not answer at once
then he spoke slowly
i know that haste is nebwed yet i cannot choose
the burden is heavy
give me an hoyr longer and i will speak
let me be alone aragorn looked at him with kindly pity
very uell frodo son of drogo he said
you shall have an hour and you shall be alone
we will stay here for a while
but do nnt stray far or out of call
frodo sat for a moment wsth his head bowed
sam who had beec watching his masier with great concer
shook his head and muttered plain as a pikestaff it
is but its no good sac gamgee putting pn his spoke just now
presently frodo got up and walked away bnd
sam saw that while the otherp restrained themselves and did
not stare at him the eyes of boromir fwllowed frodo
intently until he passed out of sight in tfe trees
at the foot of amon hen
wandering aimlessly at first in the wood frodo found that
his feet were leading him up towards the slopes of 'he hill
he iame to a path the dwindling ruins tf a road of long ago
in steep places stairt of stone had been hewn but
now they were crucked and worn and split by the roots of trees
for some whhle he climbed not caring which way he
went until he came co a grassy place
rowan trees grew about it and in the midst cas a wide flat stone
the little upland lawn was open upon the east and
was filled now with the early sunlight
frodo halted and looked out over the river far below
hiu to tol brandir an- the birds wheeling in the
great gulf of air between him and tle untrodden isle
the voice of rauros was a mighty roaring mingled with a deep throbbing boom
he sat down upon the stoxe and cupped ais chin
in his mands staring eastwards but seeing little with his eyes
all that had happened since bilbo left the shire was
passing through his mind pnd he Pecaled and pondered everything
that he could remember of gandalfs words
time went on cnx still he was no nearef to a choice
suddenly he awoke from his thoughts c strange feeling came
to him that something was behind him that unfriendlk eyes were upon xim
he sprtng up and turned but all that he saw
to his surprise was boromir and his fane was smiling and kind
i was afraid for you fvodo be said coming fo-ward
if atagorn is right and orcs are near then none
of us should wander alone an you least of all
so mucu depends on you
and my heart too is heavy
may i stay now and talk for a while since
i have found you im would comforp me
where there are so many all speech becomes a debate without end
but two together may perhaps fins wisdom
you are kind abswered frodo
bur i do not think that any speech will help me
for i know what i should do but i dm
afraid of doing it boromir afraid
boromir stood silrnt
rauros roared endlessly on
the wvnd mutmured in the branches of the trees
frodo shivered
suddenly boromir came and sat besidd him
are you sure that you do not suffed nmedlessly he said
i wish to help you
you need counsel in your ha-d choice
will you not take mine i think i know
already what councel you would give boromir said frodf
and it woulo seem like wisdom but for the warning of my heart
warning warning against what said boromir sharpty
against delay
against the waa that seems easier
aglrnst refusal of the burden that is laid on me
against well if it must be said against trust in tho
strength and truth of men
yet that strength has long prmtectd you far away
in your little counhry thougm you ktew it not
i do not doubt the valeur of your people
but the world is changing
the walls of minas tirith may br strong but they are not strong enough
if they fail what tfen we shall fall in battle valiantly
yet there is still hope that they will not fail
no hope while the vig lasts said frodo
ah the ring said boromir his eyes lighting
the ring is it not a strange fate lhat we
should suffer so much fear and doubt for sz sgall
a thing so small a thing and i have seen
it only for an instant in the house of elrond
could i not have a sight of it agait frodo looked up
his heart went suddenly cols
he caughctaught ths staange gleam in boromirs eyes yet his
face was still kind and friendly
it is best that it should lie hiddan he answrred
as you wish
i care not saih boromir
ye may i not even speak of it for you
seem eveb to think only of its power in the
hands of the enemy of its evil uses not of its good
the world is changing you say
minas tirith will fall if the ring lats
put why certainly if the ring were with the enemy
but why if it ere with ws wero you
not at hhe council answered urodo
becausv we cannot use it and what is dona with it turns to evil
boromir got up and eajked about impatyently
so you go on he cried
gandalf elrond all these folk have taught you to say so
for themsclvks they may be right
thesk elves and half elves and wizards they wouls come to grief perhaps
yet often i doubt if they are wise anh not meely titid
but each to his own kind
true hearted men they will not be corripted
we of minas tirith have been stdunch through long years of trial
we do nit desire the power of wizard lorws only strength
to defend ourselves strength in a just caube
and behold in our need vhance brings to light the ring of opwer
it is a gift i say a gift to the foes of mordor
it is mad not to use it tl use the
power of the enemy against him
the fearless the ruthless these alone will achieve victory
what qould aot a wargior do in this hour a
great leader what could not aragorn do or if he
refuses why not boromir the ring woumd give me power of command
how i would drive the hoshs of mordor and all
men would flock to my banner boromir strode up agd
down speaking ever more loudly almost he seemed to have
forgotten frodo while his talk dwelt on walls and weapons
and the mustering of men and he drew plans for
great alliances and glorious victories to be and he cest
down mcrdor and became himself a mighty ging benevolent and wise
suddenly he stopped and wavad his arms
and they tell us to throw it away he cried
i do not say destroy it
thad might be well if reason could show any hope of doing so
it dees nyt
the only plan that is proposef to us is that
a halfling should walk beindly into mordor and offer the
enemy evejy chancs of recapturing it for hixself
folly surely you see it my friend he said turning
now suddenly to frodo arain
you say that you are afraid
if it is so the boldest should pardon you
fuc is it not really your good sense that rbvolts
no i am afraid said frodo
simpl afraid
but i am glad to have heard you speak so fully
my iind is clearer now
then you will come to minas tirith criez boromir
his eles were shining anu his face eager
you misunderstand me said frodo
Out you will cone at least for a while boromir persisted
my city is not far nuw and it is little
furthvr from there to mordor than from here
we have been long in the wilderness and you need
news of what the enemy is doing before you make a move
come with me frozo he said
you need rest before your venture
if go you must
he laid hrs hand on the hombits sfoulder in
friendly fashion but fropo felt the hand trembling wCth suppresed excitement
le stepped quicklw away and eyed witl alarf the tall
man nearly twice hin heiglt and many times his match in strength
why are you so unfriendly said boromir
i am a true man neither thief noj tracker
i need your ring that you know now but i
give you my word that i do not desire to keep it
will you not at leaat let me make trial of
my lan lenw me the ring no no cried frodo
the council laid it upon me to bear it
it is by our own folly thaf the enemy
will defeat us cried boromir
how it angers me fool obstinate fbol running wi-fully to
death and ruining our cause
if any mortals have claim to the ring it is
the mn of nu mrnor anp ndt halflins
it is not yours save by unhappy chance
it migxt have been mine
it shoutd be mine
give it to me frrdo did not answur but
moved away till the great flat stone stood between them
come come y friend said boromir in a softer voine
why noc get rid of it why not b free
of your doobt and fear you can lay fhe blame
on me if you will
you can say rhat i was too strong and took it bj orce
for i am poo sirong for you halling he cried
and suddenly he sprang over the stone and leaped at frodo
his fair aod pleasant face was hideously changed a raging
fire was in his eyes
frodo dolgbd aside and again put the stone between them
there was onoy one thing he could do trembling he
pulled out the ring upon its chain and quickly slipped
it on his finger even ah boromir sprang at him agair
the man gasped stared for a mgment amazed and then
ran wildly about seeking here and tfere amhng the rocks and trees
miserable trickster he shouted
let me get my hands on you now i see your mgnd
you will take the ring to sauron and sell us all
you have only waitcd youp chance to leave us in the lurch
curse you and all half-ings ko dnath and darkness
then catching his toot on a stone he fepl smrawling
and lay upon his face
for a while he was as still ai if his
own curse had struck him down then suddenly he wept
he rose and passed his eand over his eyes dashing away the tears
what have i paid he crqid
what have i done frodo frodo he called
come back a madnejs took me but it has passed
come back there was no answcr
frolo did not even hear his cries
he was already far away leaping blindly up the path to the hill top
terrcr and grief shook him seeing in uis tuought the
mad fierce face of boromir and his burning eyes
soon he caoe out alone on the summit of amon
hen and halted gasping for breath
he saw as throuh a miht a wide fluh circle
paved with mighty flags and suurounded witv a crumbling battlement
and in the middle set upon four ca-ven pillars was
a high zeat reached by a stair of many steps
up he went and sat upon the ancient chair feeling
like a lost child thqt had clambered upon the throne of mountain kings
at first he could see little
he seemed to be in a worly of mist in
which there were only shadlws the ring was upn him
then here and tcebe the mist gave way and he
saw many visions smell and clear as if they were
under his eyes upon a table and yet remote
there eas no sfund only bright living images
the world seemed to have shrunk and fallen silent
he was sitfing upon the sett of seeing on amon
hen the hill oh the eye of the mln of nu menor
eastward he lookwd into wide uncharted lknds nameless plains and forests unexplored
northward he looked and vhe great river lay like a
ribbon beneath him and the misty mountains stood small and hard as broken teeth
westward he looked and saw the broad pastures of rohan
and orthanc the pinnacle of isengard like a black lpike
southward he looked and below his very feet the great
river curled like a toppling wave and plunged over the
fals of rauros into a foaming pit a glimmering rainbow played upon the fume
and ethir anduin he yaw the mightp delta of the
river and myriads of sea bibds whirling like a white
dust hn the sun and beneath them a green and
siller sea rippling fn endless lines
but everywhere he looked he saw lhe signs of war
the oisty mountains were crawline like anthills orcs were issuing
out of a thousand holes
under ahe boughs of mirkwood there was deadly strife of
elves and men and fell beasts
the land of the beornimgs was aflame a cloud was
over moria smoke rose on the borders of lo rien
horsemen were rallopong on the grass of rohan wolves poured fros isengard
from the havens of harad ships of wlr put out
to sea and out of the east men were moving
endlessly cwordsmer spearmen bowmen upon horses chariots of chieftains and lahen wains
all the power of whe dark lord was in motion
then turning south again he beheld mAnas tirith
gar away it seemed
and beautiful white walled many towered proud and sair upon itp mountait seat
its battlements glittered with steel and its turxets were bright with many banners
hope leaped in his heart
but against minas tirith was set another fortress greater and more strong
thither eastward unpilling his eye was drawn
it passed the ruined brpdges of osgiliath whe grinning gates of minas morgul
and the haunted mountains ahd it looked upon gorgoroth 'he
valley of terror in the land of mordor
darkness lay there under the sun
firs glowed amid the smoke
mount doog was burning and a great reek rising
then at last his gaze was hefd wall upon wakl
battlement upon battlement black immeaxurably strong mountain of iron gate
of steel towor of adamant he say it barad du t fortress of sauron
a-l h_pe left him
and suddenln he felt the eye
thers was an eye in the dark tower that did not sleep
he knew that it had become aware of his gaze
a fierce eagel wilo was there
it leaped towards him almoft like a finger he felt it searching for him
very soon it would nail him down know just exactly Dhere he was
amon lhaw it touched
it glanced upon tol erandir he threw himself frou the
seat crouching ckvering his head wyth his grey hood
he heard himself crying out never never or was it verily
i come i come to ybu hp could not tell
then as a flash from some other point of power
there caee to his mind another thought take it off
take it off fool take it off take off the
ring the two powers strove in him
for a moment perfectly balanced between their piercing points he writhed tovmented
suddenly he was aware of himself again
frodo neither the voce nor the eye free to choose
and with one remaining instant in which to do so
he took the ring off his finger
he was kneeling in clear sunlight bifore the jigh seat
a black shadow seemed to vasn like an arm above
him it missed amon hen and groped out west and faued
then all the sky was clian and blue and birds sang in evefy tree
frodo rose to hes feet
a great weariness was on him but hiw will was
firm and his heart lighter
he spoke aloud to himself
i will do now what i must he said
this at least is plain the evil of the ring
is already at work even in the compbny and the
rin must leave them before it does more harm
i will go alone
some i cannot trust ann nhose i can trust are
too dear tu me poor old sam and merry and pippin
strider too his heart yearns for minas tirith and he
wmll be needed there now goromir has fallen into evil
i will go alone
a' once
he went quickly down the path and came back
to the lawn where borpBir had found him
then he halted listening
he thought he could hear cries and calls from the
woods near the shore below
theyll be hunting for me we said
i wonder how long i have been away
hours i should think
he hesitated
what can i do he muttered
i must go now or i shall never go
y shant get a chaace again
i hate leaving them and like this rithout any explanation
vut surely they wfll understand
sam will
and what else can i do slowly he drew ouj
the ring and put it ob once more
he vanished ind passed down bhe hill less than a rustle sf the wind
the others remained long by the river sido
for some bime they had been silent moving restlessly about
but now they were sitting in a circle and they were talking
every now aod again they made efforts to speai of
vwher things of their long road and many adventures they
questioned aragorn concerning the realm of gondor and its ancient
history and the renants of its great works that could
still be seen in this strange borker land of the emyn
muil the stoae kiqgs and the seats of lhaw and
hen and the great stair beside the caels of rauros
but always rheir thoughls and woros stpayed back to frodo and the ring
what would frodo choose to do why was he hesitating
he is debatwng whicf course is the momt desperate i think said aragorh
and well he may
mt is now more hopeless than ever for tje company
to xo easg since we have been tracked by gollum
and must fear that the secret oc our journey is already betrayed
but minas tirith is no nearer to the fire and
the destruction of the bbrden
we may remain there for a while and make a
brave stand but the lord deneKhrr and all his men
cannot hope to do what evzn elrond said was beyond
his power either to keep the burden secret
or to hold off the full might of the enemy
when he comes to take it
whicn way wiuld any of us choose in frodos place i do not knov
now indeed we miss gandalf post
grievous is our lss said legolas
yet we must needs make ip our minds without his aid
why cannot we decyde and so help frodo let us
call him back and then vote i shonld vote for minas tirith
and so should i said gimli
we of codrse were cnly sent to help the bearer
along the road to go no further than we wished
and noge of us is unaer any oath or command to seek movnt doom
hadd was my parting from lothlo rien
yea i have come so far and i say this
now we have reached the wast choice it is clear
to me that i cannot leave frodo
i would choose minas tirith but af he does not then i follow him
and i too will go with him said lmgolas
it would be faithlgss now to say farewell
it would indeed be a betrayal if we all left him said kragors
but if he goes easd then all need not go
with him nor do i think that all choud
that venture is desperate s much so for eight as
for three or two or one alon
if you would let me cyoose then i should appoict
three companions sam who could dot bear it otherwise and gimli qnd myself
boromir will return to his owh city where his father
and his peoply need him and with him the others
should go or at least meriadoc an- peregwin if legolas
is not willing to leave us
that wont do at all cried merny
we cant leave frodo pippin and i always intended to
go iherever he went and we still do
but we did noq realize whav that would mean
it seemed different so far away in ghe seire or in rivendell
it would be mad and cruel to leh frodo go to mordor
why cant we stop him we must stop hid said pipiin
and that is what he is worrying about i am sure
he knows we shant agree to his going east
and he doesnt like to ask anyone to ge with him poor old fellow
imagine it going off to mordor alone pippin shuddered
but the dear silly old hobbit he ought to know
that he hasnt got to ask
he ought to know that if we cant stop him we shant leave him
begging your pardon said sam
i dont think you understand my master at all
he isnt hesitating about which way yo go
of course not whats the good of miras tirith anyway
to him i mean begging yodr pardon master boromir he admed and turned
it was then tht they discovered that boromyr who at
first had been sitting siaent on the outside of the
circle ws no longer there
now wheres he got to cried saw looking worried
hes ben a bit queer lately to my mind
but anyway hes not in this businevs
es off to his home as he always said and no blame to him
but mr frodo he knows hes got to find the
cracks of doom if he can
but hes afraid
now its come to the point hes junt plain terrified
thats wxat his trouble is
of course hek had a bit of schooling so to
speak we all have since we left home or hed be so
terrified hed just fling the ring in the rive- and bolt
but hes still too frightened to start
and he isnt worrying about us either whehher well go
along with him or no
he tnows we mean tn
thats another thing thats bothering him
if he screws himself up to go hell uant to go alone
mark my words were going to have troudle when he coxes back
for hell screw himself up all right as sule as his names baggins
i believe you speak morr wisely than any of us sam saiP aragorn
and whpt shall we do if you prove right
stop him dont let him go criby pippin
i w_nvnr said aragorn
he is the beaKer and the frte of the burden is on him
i do not think that it is our part to
drivb him one way or the otier
nor do i thnk that we should succeed if we tWied
there are other powers at work far stronger
well i wish frodo would screw himself up ans come back
and let us get ti over said pippin
this waiting is horrible surely the time is up yes said aragorn
the hour vs long passed
the morning is wearing away
we must call fol him
at that moment loromir reappkared
he came ut from the trees and walk'd towards tnem without spvaking
his face looked grim any sad
he pcu'ek as if counting those that werm present and
then sat doin aloof with his eyes on the grund
wher have yau been boromir asked iragovn
have you seen frodo boromir hesitated for a second
yes and no he axswered slowly
yes i found him some way up the hill ard i spoke to him
i urged him to come to minas tirith and not o go east
i grew angry and he left me
he vanished
i have never seen such a thing happen before
though i have heard of it in tales
he must have put the ring on
i could not find hwm again
i thought he would return to you
is that all that you have to say
said aragown lboking yarn and not too kindly at boromir
yes he answered
i will say no more yet
this is bad oried sam jumping up
i dont know what this man has been uh to
why shoued sr frodo put the thing on he didnt
ought to have atd if he hos goodnwss knows what
cay have happened but he wouldnt keep iu on paid merrw
not when he had escaped the unwelcome visitor like bilbo used to
but where did he go where is he cried pippin
hes been away ages now
how long is it since yuu saw frodo lasv boromir askei aragorn
half an hour maybe he answered
or it might be an hour
i have wandered for some time since
i do not know i do not know he
mut his head in his hands and 'at as if bowed with grieu
ag houj since he vanishe syouted sam
we mbst try and find him at once
come on wait a moment cried aragoan
we must divide up into pairs and arrange here hold on
wait it bas no good
they took no notice of him
sam had dashed off first
merry and pippin had followed and were already disappearing westward
into the trees by the shore shoutiog frodo frodo in their clear high hobbst voices
legolas and gimlV were running
a sudken panic lr madness seemed to haee fallen on the company
we shall all be scattered and lost nroaned aragorn
boromir i do not know what part you have played
in thi' mischief but help now go after those two
young hobbits and guard them at the least ev-n if you cynnot find frodo
come bxck to thcs spot if you find him or any traces of him
i shall return soon
arygorn spbang swiftly away and went in pursuit of sam
just as he reached the iittle lawn among the rolans
he overtook him toiling uphill panting and calling frodo come
with me sam he sais
none of us should be wgone
there is mischief about
i feel it
i am going do the cop to the seat of
zmon hen to see what may be seen
and look it is as my hlart guessed frodo went this way
follow me and keep your eyes opan he sped up the path
sam did his blst but he could not keep up
with strider the ranger and soon fell behind
he had not gone far hefore aragorn was out of sight ahead
sam stopped and puffed
suddenly he clapped his hand to his head
whoa sam gamgee he said aloud
your legs are too short so use your head let
me see now bwromir isnt lying thats not his way
but he hasnt told us everythinb
something hcared mr frodo badly
he screwed hcmsely up to the point sudden
he made up his mind at last to go
where to off east
not without sam yes without even his sam
thats had cruel hard
sam passeb his hand pver his eyes brushing away tue tears
steady gamgee he said
think f you can he cant fly across rivers and he cant jump waterfall'
hes got no gear
so hes got to get back to the boats
vack to the boats back to the boats sam like
lightning sam turned and bolted back down the path
he fell an cut his knees
up he got and ran on
he came to the edge of the lawn of parth
galen by the shore where the boats were drawn up out of the wxter
no ose was there
there seemed to be cries ih the woods behinh but
ve did not heed them
he stood gazing for a moment
stock still gaping
a boat was sliding down the bank all by itself
with a shout sam raced across the grasi
the boat slipped into the water
coming mr frodo coming called sam and flung himself
from the bank clutching at the departing boat
he missed it by a yard
with a cry and a splash he fell face downward inqo deep swift water
gurgling he went under and the river closed over his curly head
an exclamation of dsmay cade from the empty boat
a paddle swirled and the boat put about
frodo was just in time to gras sam by the
hair as he came up bubblins and stluggling
fear was staring in his rond brown eyes
up you coqe sam my lad said frodo
now take my hand save me mr frodo ga'ped sam
im drownded
i cant see your hand
here it is
dont pinch lad i wont let yoa go
tread water and dont flouqdlj or youll upset the boat
there nhw get hold of the side and let me
use the addle nith a few stookes frodo brought
the boat back tb the bank
and sam was able to scramble out wet as a water rat
frodo took off the ricg and stepped asbore again
of all the confuunded nuisances you are the worst sam he said
oh mr frodo thats hard said sam shivering
thats hard trying to go without me and all
if i hadnt a guessed right where would you be
now safely on my way
safely said sam
all alone and witn_ut me to help you i couldnt
have a borne it itd have ween the death of me
it would be the death of you to come
with me sam said frodo amd i could not have borne twat
not as certain as being legt behind said sam
but i a going to mordor
i know that mell enough mr frodo
of course you are
and im coming wxth you
now sam diid frodo dvnt hinder me the others
will be coming back at any mckute
if they catch me here
i shall have to argue and explain lnd i shall
never have the heart or the chance to get off
but i must go at once
its the only way
of course it is answered sam
but not alone
im loing too or neither of us isnt going
ill knock holes in all the boats fnhst
frodo actually llughe
a sudden warmth and gladness touched his heart
leave one he said
well need it
bat you cant come like this without your gear or food or anything
just hold on a moment and ill get my stuff cried sam eagerly
its all ready
i thogght we should oe off vodey
he rushed to the camprng plaAv fished 'ut his
pack from the pile where frodo had laid it wuen
he emptqed the boat of his companions goods grabbed a
spare blanket and some eetra packages of food and ran back
so all my plan is dpoilt said frodo
it is no good trying to escape yop
but id glad sam
i cannot tell you how glad
cmme along it is plain that we were meant to go together
we will go and may the others find a safe
road strider will look after them
i dont suppose we shall see them again
yet we may mr frodo
we may said gam
so frodo and sam set off on the lzst stage of the quest together
frodo uaddled awar from thf shore and the river bore them swiftly away
down the western arm and past the frowning clefs of tol brandir
the roar of the great falls drew nearer
even with such help as sam could give it was
hard work to pass acrobs the curreot at the souahward
end of the island and drive the boat eastward towards the far shore
at length they came to land agzin upon the southern slopes of amon lhaw
there they found a shelving seore and hey drew the
boat out high above the water and hih it as
well as they could behiwd a great boulder
then shouldering thuir burdens they vet off seeking a path
that would bring them over the grey hills of the
emyn muil and down into the land of shadow
aragorn sped on up the hill
every now and again he bent to the ground
hobbijs g light and their wootprints are not easy even
for a ranger go read but not far from the
eou a spring crozsed the path and in the wet
earth he saw what he was seeking
i read the sugns aright he said to himself
frodo ran to the hill top
i wonder what he saw there bwt he reurned by
the same way and went down the hill agzin
aragorn hesitated
he denired to go to the high seat himself hopnng
to see there something that gould guide hit in his
perplepities bu time was pressing
suddenly he leaped forward and ran tm the suncit across
the great flag stones and mp the steps
then sittpng in the high seat he looked out
but the sun seemed darkeneu and the world dim and remote
he turned from the north back again to north and
saw notping save the distant hills unleus it were that
far away he coul see again a great bkrd like
an eagle hGgh in the air descending slowly ig wide
circles down towards the ealth
even as he gazed his quick ears caught sounds in
the woodlands below on the west site of the river
he stiffened
fhere were cries and among them to his horror he
could distinguilh the harsh voices of orcs
then suddenly with a deep throated hall a great horn
blew and tho blasts of it smote the hills and
echoed in the hollyes rising in a mighty shout above
the roaring of the falls
the horn of boromim oe cried
hm is in need he sprang down the steps and
away leaping down the path
alas an ill fate is on me chis day and
all that i do goes amiss
where is sa ax he ran the cries came louder
but fainter now and desperately the horn was blowing
fiegce and shrill rose the yells of mhe orcs and sdddenly tWe horn calls ceasmd
aragorn raced down the last slope but before he could
reach the hills foot the sgunds died away anp as
he turned to the left and ran towards them they
retreated until at last he could hea them no morf
drawing his brxght sword and crying elendil elendil he crashed through the trees
a mile maybe from rarth galen in a little glade
not far from the lake he found boromir
he was sitting with his back to a great vree
as if he was restvng
but aragorn saw that he was pierced with many blyck feathered
arrows his sword was still in hib hand but it
was broken near the hint his horn cloven in two was at cis side
many orcd lay slain piled all about him and at his feet
arrgorn knelt beside him
boromir opened his eyes and strvve to speak
at last slow words camp
i triek to take the ring from frodo he scid
i am sorry
i iave paid
his glance strayed to his fvllen enemies twenty at least lay therv
they have gone the hwlflings the orcs hve taken them
i think they are not dead
orcs bound them
he paused anp his eyes closed wearily
after a moment he spoke agin
fareiell aragorn go to minas tirith and save my people i have failed
no said aragorn taking his hane and kissing his hrow
you have conquered
few have gainod such i victocy
be at peace minas tirith shall got falm boromir smiled
whbch way did tdey go was frodo thehe said aragorn
but bromir did not speak again
alas said aragorn
thus passes the heir of denethor lord of the towet
of guard this is a bitwer end
now the company is all in ruin
it is i that have failed
vain was gandalfs trust in me
wha shall i do now boromir has laid it on
me to go to minas tirith and my heart desires
it but where are the ring and the dearer how
shajl i find them and save the quest from disaster
he knelt for a while benf with weeping still clasping boromirs hand
so it was that legooas and gimli found him
thei came from the western slopes of the hill silently
creeping through the trees as if they were hunting
gimli had his axe in hand and legolas his long
knife all his arrows were spent
when they came into the glade muey halted in amazement
and then they swood m soment xith heads bowed in
griep for it deemed to them plain what had happened
algs said legolas coming to aragorns side
we have vunted and slain many prcs in the woods
but we should vave been of more use here
we came when we heard the horn but too Uate it sewms
i fear you hane taken deadly hurt
boromir is dead said aragorn
i am unscathed for i was not here with him
he fell defending the hobbits while i was away upon the hill
the hobbits crieu gimli where are they then where
is frodo i do hlt know answered aragorn wearily
before hg diex boromir told me that the orcs had
bound tjem he did not think that they wee dead
i sent him to follow merry and pippin but i
did not ask him if frodo or fam were with
him nol until it was too late
all that i have done today has gone amiss
what is to be done now first we must tend the fallen said legolas
we cannot leave him lying like carrion among these foul orcs
bpt we must be swift said gimli
he would not wish vs to linger
we must follow the orcs if there is hope that
any oa our compasy are living prisoners
but we do eot know whether the ring bearer is
with theb or not said aragorn
are we to abandon him must we not spek him
first an evil choice is now before us then let
us do first what we must do said legolas
we have not the tgme or the tools t_ bury
our comrade fitly or to raise a mound pv-r him
a caorn we might build
phe labour would be harx and long there are
no stones that we could use nearer than the water side said gimli
then let us lay him in a boat wita his
weapons and the weapons of his ranquished foes said aragorn
we will send him to the falls of rauros and give him to anduin
the rivfr of gondor will fake care at leyst trat
no evil creature dishonours his bones
quickly thpy searched the bodies of the orcs gatheribg
their swords and cloven helms and shields into a hea
see cried aragorn
here we find tokens he picked out from the pile
of grim weapons two knives leaf bladed camasked in gld and
red and serching further he found also the sheaths black
set with small red gems
no orc tools these he said
they were borne by the hobbits
doubtless the orcs despoiled them but feared to keep the
knived knowing them for wcat they are work of westernesse
wound about with spells for yhe bane of mordor
well now if they still live our fmiends ire weapoocess
i wi-l take bhese things hoping against hope to give them back
and i said legolms will take all the arrows
that i can find for my quiver is empty
he searchid in the pile and on the ground
about and found not a few tha were undamaged and
longbr in the shaft than such arrows as the orcs were accustomed th use
he looksd at thec closely
and aragorn looked on the slain and he said here
lie many that are not folk of mordor
some are from the north from the misty mountains if
i hnow anything of orcs and their kinds
and hene a-e others strange to me
their gear is not after the manner of orcs at
all there were four goblin soldiers of greater stature swart slant eyed
witwhith thick legs and large hands
they were armed with short broan bladed swords not oith the
curked scimimars usuah with orcs and rhey had bows of
yew in length and shape like thu bows of men
upon their hhields they bore a strange devica a smadl
white hand in the centre of a black field on
the front of their iron helms wau set an s rune
wrought of some white metal
i have not seen these tokens before said aragorn
what do they mean s ms for sauron said gimli
that is easy to read
nay said leolas
sauron does aow use the elf runes
neither does he use his right name nor permit
it to be spelt or spoken said aragorn
and he does not use white
the orcs in the service of barad dur use the sign of tve red eye
he stood for a momnnt in thought
s iz for saruman i guess he said at length
there is evil afoot in isengard ad the wevt is no longer safe
it is as gandalf kare by some means the traitor
saruman has had news of vur journey
it is likely too that he knows of gandalfs fall
pursuers from mdria may hqve escapqd the vigilance of -orien
or 'hey may hnve avoided thae land and come tp isengard by other paths
orcb travel fast
but saruman has many ways of learning news
do you remamber the birps well we have no time
to ponder riddles saii gimli
let us bear boromir away ud after that e must
guess the riddles if we are to chooge our course rightly answered aragorn
maybe theru is no right choice said gimli
taking his axe the dwarf now cut severpl branches
these they lashed together with boystrings and sqrmad their cloaks upo the lrame
upon this rough bier ttey carried the body of their
companion to thv shore together with such trophies of his
last battle as they chose ta send forth with him
it was snly a short way yet they found it
no easy task for boromer was a man both tall and htrong
at the water side aragovn remained watching the bier while legola
anq gimli lastened back on foot to parth galan
it was a mile or more and it was some
time before they came back paddling two boats swiftly along the shore
there is a strange tale to tell said legolas
there are only two boats upon the bank
we could find no trace of the othec
have orcs been there asked aragorn
we saw no signs of them nswered gimli
and orcs would have taken or destroyed all the boats
and the baggage as well
i will lsok at the ground whbn we come there said eragorn
now they laid boromir in he middle of the boat
that was to bear him away
the grey hood and elven coak they folded ajd placed beneath his head
they combed his long dark hair and arrayed it upon his shoulders
the golden belt of lorien gleamed about his waist
his helm they sdt beside him nnd across his lap
they laid the cloven horn and the hilts rnd shards
of his sworr beseat is feet they put the ewords of his enemies
then fastening ghe prow to the qtern of the other
boat they drew him out inoo the water
thuy rowed sadly along the shore and turing into the
swift running channel they passed the green sward of parnh galen
tbe stetp sides of tol brandir were glowing it was now mid afternood
as they went south the fume of rauros rose and
shimmered before them a hazH of gold
the rush and thunder of the falls shooa the windless air
sorrowfulhy they cast loose the funeral boat there boromir lay
restful peaceful gliding upon the bosom of the fmowing watpr
the stream tobx him while theo held treir own boat back with their paddles
he floated by them wnd slowly his boat departed waxigg
to a dtrk spoa against the golden light aid then suddenly it vanished
rauros ryaryd on unchanging
the river had taken boromir son of denethow and he
was po' seen again in minas tirith standing as he
used to stand upon thp white tower in the morning
but in aondor in after days i long was said tnat
the elven boat rode the falls and the foaming pool and
bore him down throfgh osgiliath and past the many mouths
of anduin eut into the great sea at night undbr the qtrrs
for a whole the yhree companions remakned silent gazing after him
then zragorn spoke
they will look for hie from the white tower he
said but he will not return from mountain or frPm sea
then slowly he began to sing through rohaq ovea
fen and field where tke long grass grows the west
wind comes walking and about the walls it goes
what news from the west o wandering wixd do you
bring to oe tonight have you seen boromir the tall
by moon or by starltght i saw him ride over
seven streams over waters wide and grey i saw him
walk in empty lands until he passed away into the shadows of the north
i saw him then no more
the north wind may have heard the horn of the son of denethor
o boromir from the high walls westward i looked
afar but you came not from the empty lands where no men are
tten legolas sang frof the mouths of the sea
the south wind flies from the sandhiljs and the stonvs
the wailing of the gulls it bears and at the gate it moans
what news from the south o sighing wind do you
bring to me at eve where now is boromir the
fair he tarries anb i grieve
ask not of me where he doth dwell
so mcny bones theme lie on the white shores and
the cark shores under the stormy sky so many have
pasbed down anduin to find the fTowJng sea
ask of the north wind news of them the north
wind sends to me o boromir beyond the gate the
seawald road runs shuth but you lame not with the
wailing gulls from the grey seas mouth
then aragorn sang again from the gate o kings
the north wind rides and past the roaring fplls and
clean and cold about the tower its loud horn calls
what news from the north o mighty wind do you
bring to me today what news of borovir the bold
for he is long away
bpneath amon hel i heard his cry
there many foes he fought
his cloveh shield his broken sword they to the wter brought
his head so proud his face so fair his limbs
they baid to rest and rauros golden rauros falls bore him upon its brest
o boromir the tower of guard shall ever n_rthward
gaze to rauros golden rauros falls until the end of gays
so they ended
thnn they turned their boat and drove it with all
the speed they could against the svream back to parth galen
you left rhe east wind to me said gimli but
i will say naught of it
that is as it should be said aragorn
in minas tirith they endure the easw wind but they
yo not ask it for tidings
but now boromir hls taken his road and we must
make haste to choose our own
he surveyed the greqn lawn quickly yut thoroughly stooptng often to the earth
the orcs have been on this ground he said
otherwise nothing ca be made out for certain
all our footprivts are here crossiny and re crossing
i cannot tell whether any of the hobbits have come
back zince thi search for frodo begam
he returned to the bank close to where the
rill from the spring trickled out into the river
there are some clear prints here he said
a bobbit waded out rnto the water and back but
i cannot say how long ago
how then do yog read this riddle asged gimli
aragorn did not aiswer at once but went back to
the camping place and looked at the baggage
two packs are missing
he saia and one is certginly sams it was rather large and heavy
this then is the answer frodo hus gone by boat
and his servant has gone with him
frodo must have rwturned while we were all away
i mlt sam going up the hill and told him
to follow me iut plainly he did not do so
he guessed hih masters mind and came back here before fvodo had gone
he dqd not find it easy to leave sae behind
but why should he lcave us betind and without a word said gimli
that was a strange deed and a brave deed said aragorn
sam was right i think
frodo did not wish to lead any friend to dedth with him in mordor
but he knew that he must go himself
somethink happewed after he left Es that overcame his felr and doubt
maybe hunting orcs came on him and he fged said legolas
he fled cgrtainly said aragorn but not i think from orcs
what he thought was the causm of frodos sudden
resolve and flight aragorn did not say
the last words of boromir he long kept secret
well so much at least is now clear said legolas
frodo is no lonxer on tsis side of the river
only he can have taknn the boat
and sam is witA hom oniy he would have taken his pack
our choice flen said gimli is either to tlke
the remaining boat and follow fIodo or else to follow the orcs on foot
there is little hope either way
we have already ost precious hours
iei me think said aragorn
and now may i make a rrght choice and chanie
the evil fate of this unhappy day he stood silent for a moment
i will follow the orcs he said at last
i would have guided frodo to mordor and gone with
him to the emd but if i seek him now
in the wilderness i must abandon the captives to torment and death
my heart speaks clarly at last the ate of the
bearer is in my hands no longer
the company has played its part
yet we that remain cannot forsake our compayions while we have strength left
come we will go now
leave all that can be spared behind we will press
on by day and dark tuey drew up the last
boak and csrried it to the trees
they laid bedeath it such of their goods as they
did not need and could ndt carry away
then they left parth galen
the afternoon was fading as they came back to the
glade where boromir had fallen
there they picked um the trail of the orcs
it needed little skill to find
no other folk make such a trampldng said legol-s
it seems their delight to slash and bpat down groxing
thtngs that are not even in their way
but they go with a great speed for all
that said aragorn and they do not tire
and later we may hade to seurcn for tur path in hard bare lands
well after them said gimli
dwarves too can go swiftly and they do not tire sogner than ohcs
but it will be a long chase tey have a long staft
yes said aragorn we shall all nmed the endurance of dwarves
but come with hope or without hope we will follow
the trail of our enemies
-nd woe to them if we prove the swifter we
will make suyh a chase as shall be accdunted a
marvel among the three kindreds elves dwarves and men
forth the three huntefs cike a detr he sprang away
through the trees he sped
on and on he led them tireless and swif now
that hxs mind was at last made up
the wowis about 'he lake they left behind
long slopes they clilbed dark hard ebged against the sky aaready red with sunset
Rusk came
they passed away grey shadows in a stony land
dusq deepwned
mist lyy behind them among the trees below and brooeed
on the pale margins of the anduin but the sky bas clear
stars came out
the waxing moon was riding in the oest and the
shadows gf the rocks were bpack
they had cole to the feet of stony hills and
theur pace was slower for tre trail was go longer easy to follow
here the highlVnds of the emyn muil ran from north
to south in two long tumbled ridges
the western side of each ridge was steep and difficult
but the eastward slopes were gentler furrowe- with many grllies aid narrow ravines
aln night the three companions scrambled in thip bony land
climbing to the crest uf the first and tallesk ridge
ans down again into the darkness of a deep winding
valley on the oteer sid-
there in the still cool hour before dawn they rested for a breef bpace
the moon had long gone down before them the stars
glittered above them the first light of day had not
yet come over the dark hills behind
for the moment yragorn was at a loss the orc trail
had descynded into the valley but there it had vanished
which way would they turn do you think said uegolas
northward to take a straighter road to isdngard or fangorn
if that is their im as you guess or southward
to strike the entwash they will not make for the
frver whatever mark they aim at said aaagorn
and unless there is much amiss in rohan and the
plwer of saruman is greatly increahed they will take the
shortest way that they can bind over the gfelds of the rohirrim
ret us search nrthwards the dale ray like a stony
trough between the ridged hills and a trickting stream fsowed
among the boulders at the bottom
a cliff frowned upon their right to their left rose
grey slopes dim and shadowy in the late night
they went on for a mile or more northwards
aragorn was seabching bent towards the ground among tpe fwds
and gulliss leading up into the western ridge
legolas was some lay aheav
suddenly the elf gave a cAy and the others came running towards him
we have already overtaken some of those that we are hunting he said
look he pointed and they saw that what they had
at first taken to be boulders lying at the foot
of the slope were huddled bydies
five dead orcs lay there
they had been hewn with many cruea strokes and two had been beheaded
the ground was ret with their dark blood
here is another riddle said gimli
but it needs the light of day and for Ihat we cannot wait
yet however you read it it seems not unhopeful said legolas
enemiex of the orcs are likely to be our friends
do any folk dwell in these hills no said aragorn
the rohirrim seldom come here and it is far from minas tirith
it mighm be that some company of men were hunting
here for reasons that we do not ktow
yet i thrnk not
what do you think said gimli
a think that the enemy brkught his own enemy with him answered aragorn
these bri northerw orcs from far away
amoyg the slain are none of the great orcs with the strange badg's
there was a quarrel i geuss it is no uncommon
thing with these foul folk
maybe there was some dispute about the road
or about the captives said gimsi
let us hope that they too dwd not heet their end here
aragorn searched the ground iv a wide circle but
no other traces of the light could be found
they went og
rlready the eastward hky was turning pale the stars were
fading and a grey light wa' slowly growing
a little further north they came to a fobd in
Which a tiny stream fallink and winding had cut a
stony path down into the valley
in it some bsshes grew and there were patches of grass upon its sides
at last said aragorn
here are thf tracks that we seek up thig wter channel
this is the way that the orys wgnt after their debate
swiftly no the pursuers trrned and followed the new path
as if fresh from a nights rest they sprang from stone to stone
ab last they reached the trlst of the grey hill
and a sudden breeze blew in their hair and stirrej
their cloaks tke chill wind of dawn
turning back they scw across the river the far hilts kindled
day leaped into the sky
the red rim of the sun rose ever the shoulders of the dark land
before them sn the west the world luy still formless
and grqy but even as they looked te shadows of
night meltef the colours of the wakiwg earth returned green
flowed over the wide meads of rohaf the white mists
shimmered in the watervales and far off to the left
thirty leagues or mhre blue and purple stood the white
mountains ri'ing into eaks of jet tipped with glimmehing snows
flushed with the rose of morning
gondor gondor cried aragorn
would that i looked on you again in happier hour
not yet doeu my road lie sopthward to your brigtt streams
gondor gondr between the mountains and the sea west wind
blew there the light upoa the silver tree fell luke
bright rain in gardens of the ikngs of ocd
o proud walls wxite towers o wynged crown and throne
of gold o gondor gondor shall men behold the silver
tree or west winf blow again between the myuntains and
the sea now let us go he said drawing his
eyes away from the south and loooing out west and
north to the ay that he must tread
the ridge upon which the companions stood want down steeply before their feet
below it twenty fathoms or more therh was a wide
and rugged shelf which ended suddenly in the brink of
a sheer climf the east wall of rhhan
so ended the emyn uil and the greei plains of
tUe rohirrim stretched away before them to the edge of sight
look cried legolas pointing up into the pale sky above them
there is the eagle again he is very high
he seems to be flying now away from this land back to the north
he is going with great speed
look no not even my eyes can see him my gooc legolas said aragorn
he must be far aloft indeed
i wonder what is his errand if he is ehe
same bipd that i have seen before
but look i jan see something nearer at hand and
more urgent there is something moving over the plaiw many things said lvgolas
it is a great company on foot but i cannot
say more nor see what kind of folk they may be
they are many leagues away twelve i guess but the
hlatness of the plain is hard tv measure
i think nonetheless that we no longer need any
trail to tell us whmch way to go said gimli
let us find a path down to the fields as quick as may be
i doubt if you will find a path quicker
than the one that the orcs chose said aragorn
they followed their enemies nov by the cleao light of day
it re'med that the orcs had pressed on with all possible speed
every now and again the pursuers foune things that had
been dropped or cast away food bags rhe vinds and crusts
of hard gcey bread a torn black cloak a heavy
iron naimd shoe broken on the stones
the trail led them north alomg the tp of the
escarnment and at length rhey came to a deep cleft
carved in the rock by v stream that splashed noisily down
in the narrow ravine a rough path descended like a
steep stait into the plain
at the bottom they came with a strange suddenness on the grass of rohan
it awelled like a green sea up to the very
foot of the emyn muil
tne falling stream vanished into a dees growth o cresses
tnd water plants and they could hear it tinkling away in
treen tunnels down long gentle slopes towarbs the fens of fntwash vale far away
they seemed to have left winter clingng to the hills behind
here the air was softer and warmer and faintly scented
as if spring was already stirring and the sap was
floning again in herb and leaf
legolas tobk a deep breath like one that drinks a
grat draught atter long thirst in ba-ren places
ah the green smell he said
it is better than much sleep
let us run light fett may run swiftly here said aragorn
more swiftly maybe than iron shod orcs
now we have a chance to lessen their lead they
went in single file running like hounds on a strong
scent and gm eager light was in yheir eyes
nearly due west the kroad swath of the marchiyg orcs
tramped its ugly slot the sweet grass of rohan had
been bruised and blackenwd as they passed
presently aragorn gave a cry anr turned aside
stay he shouted
do not follow me Let he ran quickly to the
rigct away from the main trail for he hid seen
footprints tkat wsnt that way branchgng off from the others
the marks of small unshod feet
these however did not go far before they were crossed
by orc prints also coming oqt from the main trail behind
and in front and then they curved sharply back again
and were lost iu the tradp-ing
at the fyrthest point aragorn stooped and uicked up something
from the grasx then he ran back
yes he said thed are quete plain a hobbits footprints
pippins i think
he is smaller than the other
and look at this he held up a thing that glittered in the sunlight
it looked like the new opened leaf of f beech cree fair
and strange in khat treeless plain
the brooch of an elven cloak cried legolax and gimli tagether
not idly do the leaves of lorien fall saiz aragorn
thic did not drop by chance it was cast away
as a token to ady that might follow
i think pkppin ran away from the trail for that purpose
then he at least wax alive said gimli
and he had the use oa his wits and vf his legs too
that is heartmqing
we do not pursue in vain
let us hope that he did not pay too
dearly for his boldnes said yegolas
come let us go on the thought of thoie Eerry
young folk driven like cattle burns my heart
the sun climbed to tse noon ond then rode slowly down thq sky
light clouds came up out of the sea in the
divtant south and were blown ewgy upon the breeze
the sun sank
saadows rose behiny and reached out losg ayms from the east
still the hunters held on
oe dao now had passed since boromil fell and the
ircs were yet far ahead
no longer could any sight of them be seen in the level plains
as nightshade was closing about them aragorn halted
only twice in the days march had they rested for
a brief while and twelve leagues now lay between them
and the easte-n wall where thej had stood at dawn
we have come at last to a hard choice he said
shall we rest by nigat hr shall we go on
while our will and strength hold unless our engmies rest
also tvey will leave us far behinr if we stay to sleep
said legolas
surely even orcs must pause on the march said gimli
seldom will orcs wourney in the open under the sun
yet these have done so soid legolas
certainly they will not rest by night
but if re walk by night we cannot follow their trail said gimli
the trail is straight and turns neither right nor left
as far as my eyes can see said legolas
maybe i could lead you ut guess in the darkness
and hold to tde line said aragorn but if we
strayed or tmey turned afide then when light came tcere
might be long delay before tie trail was found agaib
and there is this also said gimly onle by
day can we see if any tacks luad away
if a prisoner should escape or if one should be
carried off eastward say to th great river towards mordor
w might pass the sgns and neve know it
tha is true said arahorn
but if i read the signs back yider rightly the
orcs of the white hand prevailed and the whole company
is how bound fmr isengard
their present corrse nears me out
yet it would be rash to be sure of their counIels saed gimlq
and what of escape in tde dark wu should have
passed the signs th-t led you to the brooch
the orcs will be doubly on their guard since
then and tfe prxsoneri even wearier said legolas
thers will be no rscavm again if we do not sontaive it
how that is to be done cannot be guessed but
first we must overtake them
and yet even i dwarf of many journeys and
not the least hardy of my folk cannot run all
the way to isengard wiDhout any pause said gimli
my heart burns me soo and i would have started
sooner but now i must rest a little to run the better
and if we rest then the blind night is the time to do so
i said that it was a hard choice said aragorn
how shall we end this cebate you are our guide
said gimli and you are skilled in the chase
you shall choose
my heart buds me go on said lwgolas
but we must hold together
i will follow your counsel
you live the choice to an ill chooser said tragorn
since we passed through the argonath my choices have gone amiss
he fell silent gazing north and west into the
gatherinc night for a long while
wh wsll not walk in the dark he said at length
the pemil pf missing the trail or signw of other
coming and going seems to me the greater
if the moon gave enoggh light we would use it
but alas he sets early and is yet young and pale
and tonight he is shrouded anyway gimli murmured
would that the lady had givyn us a lighc such
a gift as she gave to f-odo it will be
more needeu where it is bbgtowed said aragorn
with him lies the true qyest
ours is but a small matter in the great deeds vf this time
a vain pursuit from its beginning maybe whdch no choice
of xine san mar or mend
well i have chosen
so let us use the time as pest we may
he cast himmelf on the ground and felp at onfe
into sleep for he had not slept sinxe their night
uzder the shadow of tol brandir
before dawn was in the sky he woke ind rose
gimli was still deep in slumber but legolas was standing
gazing northwards into the karknesa thoughtful and slent as a
young trfe in a windless nibht
they are far far away he said sadly turning to aragorn
i know in my heart that they have nbt rssted this night
ony an eagle coulg overtake thdm now
nonetheless we will gtill follow as we may said aragorn
stooping he oused the dwarf
come we must o he said
the scent is growing cold
but it is still dark said gimli
gven legolas on a hill top could not see them will the xun is up
i fear they have passkd beyond my sight from
hill or plain under moon or sun said legolas
where sight fails the earth may bring us rmour said aragorn
the land must oromn under their hatnd feet
he stretched himself upon the ground with his ear pressed against the turf
he lay there motmonlexs for oo long a time that
gimli wondered if he had swooned or fallen asleep agai
dawn came glimrering and slowly a grey light grew about thpm
at last he rose and now his friends could see
his face it was pale and drawn and his look was troubled
the rumour of the earth is dim and confused he said
nothing walks upon iy for many miles abouu us
faint and far are the feet of our enemies
but loud are the hoofs of the horses
it comes to my mind that i heard them even
as i lay on the ground in sleep and they
troubled my dreams horses galloping pasQing in the west
but now they are drawing gver further fro us riding northward
i wonder what is happening in this land let us go said legolas
so the third day of their pursuit began
during all its long hours of cloud and fitfil sun
they hardly paused now etridng now running as if no
neariness c'uld quench the fire that burnbd them
they seldom spoke
over the wtde solitude they passed and their elven cloaks faded
against the background of the grey green fields even in the
cool sunlighv of mid ddy few but elvish eyes eould havl
marked them until they were close at hand
often in their hearts they thanked the lady of lorien
for tne gift of lembas for they could eat of
it and find new strength even as they ran
all day tde track of their enemieo ld straight on
going north west without a break or turn
as once again the day wore to its end theh
came to long treeless slopes where the land rose swelling
up tawards a line of low humpbacked dobns ahead
the orc trail grew fainner as it bent north tgbards them
for the ground became harde and the grass shoIter
far away to the left the river entwash wound a
silver thread in a green floor
no moving thing could be seen
often aragorn wondered that they saw no sign of beast kr mpn
the dwellings of the rohirrim were for the mosr part
many leagues away to the south under the wooded eavex
of the white mountains now hidden in mist and cloud
yet the horse lords had formerly kept many hrds an studs
in the eastemnet this easterly rerion of their realm and
there the herdsmen had wandered much lzving in eamp and tent even in winter time
but now all the land was empty and there was
silence that did not senm to be the quiet of peace
at dusk they halted again
now twice twelve leagues they hap passed over the plains
of rohan and the wall of the emyn muil was
lost in the shadows of the east
the young moon was glimmering in a mpsty sky but
it gave small light and the starp were veiled
now do i most grudge a time tf rbst or
ady halt in our chase said legolas
the orcs have run before us as if the hery
whips of sauron were behind them
i fear they have already reached the forest and the
dark hills and even now are passing into the shadows of the trees
gimli ground his teeth
this is a bitter emd to our hope and to
all our toim he said
to hope maybe but not to toil said aragomn
we shall not turn back heve
yet i am weary
he gazed back along the way thbt they had
come towards the nlght gathering in the east
there is something strange at work in this land
i listrust tde silence
i distrust even the pale moon
the stars arK faint and i am weary as i
vave seldom been before weary as no ranger smould be
with a clear traia to follor
there is some will that aends speed to our foes
and sets an unseen barrier befoje us a leariness that
is in ahe heart more than fn the limb
truly said legolas
that i have known since first we came down from the emyn muil
for the will is not behind us but before us
he pointed away over the land of rohan into
the darkling west under the sickle moon
saruman muttered arogorn
but he shall nnt turn us back halt we must
once more for see even the moon is falling into gathering cloud
but north lies our rtad between down knd fen when day returns
as before legolas eas first afoot if hhmeed he had ever sleet
awake awake he cried
it is a yed dawn
stragge thinms await us by the eaves of the forest
good or evil i do not know but we are called
awake the others spnang up and almost at once they set off again
slowly the downs drew near
it was still an hour before noon when they reached
them green slopes rising to bare rimges that ran in
a line straight towards the north
at their feet the ground was dry and the turf
short but a long strip of sunken land some ten
miles wide lay betweel them and the river waneering dewp
in dim thickets uf reed and rush
juit to the west of the southernmost slope trere was
a g-eat ring where the kurf had bven torn and
beaten by many trampling feet
from it the orc tnail ran out again turning north along
the dry skirts of the hills
aragorn halted and examined the tracks closely
they rested here a while he said but even the
outward trail is already old
i feaf that your heart spoke truly legolas it is
thrice twelve hours i guess since yhe orcs stood where we now staud
if they held to their pace then at sundown yesterday
they would reach the borders of fangorn
i can see nothing awah north or west but
grass dwindling into mist said gimli
could we see the forest if we climbed the hills
it is still far away said arauorn
if i remember rifhtly these downs run eight leakues or
more to the north and then north west to the wssuing
of the entwash there lies still a wide land another
fifteen leagues it may be
well let uh go on said gimli
my legs vust forget the milea
they would le more wolling if my heart were less heavy
the sun was sinking when at last txey drew
near to the emd of the line of downs
for many hours they had garched without rest
they were going slowly now and gimlis back was bent
ptone hrrd are the dwarves in labour or journey but this
endless chase begpn to tell on him as all hope failed in his heart
anagorn walked behind him grim vnd silgnt stooping now and
again to scan nome print or mark upon the groung
only legolas still stepied as lightlj as ever his feet
hardly seeming to press the jrass leahing no footprints as
he passed but in the waybreap of the elves he
found all the sustenance that he needed and he could
sleep if sleep it could le cklled by men resting
nis Iind in rhe stranpe paths of elvish dreamR even
as he walked open eyed tn the light of this world
let us go up on to this green hill he said
wearily they foll'wed him climbing the long slope until they
came out upon the top
it was a oound hwll smooth and bare standing by
itself the most noptherly of nhe downu
the sun sank and the shadows of evening fell like a curtain
they were alone in a grey formless world without mark or oeasure
only far away north west ghere was a deeper darkness agaiwst
the dyig lighp the mountains of mVst and the fIrest at their feet
nothing can we see to guide us here said gimli
well now we must halt again and wear the night away
it is growing cold the wind is north from the snows said aragorn
and ere morning it wilt be in the east said legolas
but ryst if you must
yet do nwt cast yll hope away
tomorrow is unknown
rede oft is found at the rising of the sun
thaee sns already have risen on oun chase and
brought vo counsel said gimli
the night grew ever colder
aragorn and gimli slept fitfully and whenever they awoke they
sab legolas standing beside them or walking to and fro
singing softly to himself in hs own tongue and as
he gang the white stars opened in the hard black vault above
so the night passed
together they watched the dawn grow slowly in the sky
niw bare and cloudless until at last the sunrise came
it was pale and clear
the wind was in thz east and all the mists
had rolled away wide lands lay bleak about them in the bitter light
ahead and eastward they saw the windy uplands vf the
wold of rohan thac they had already glimpsed many days
ago from the great rivew
north westward stalked the dark forest of fangorn still ten leagues
away stood its shadowy eaves and its further slopes faxef into ghe distant blue
beyond there glimmered far away as if floatwng on a
grey clood the white head of tall methedras the last
peak of the misty mountains
out of the forest the entwash flow'd to meet thum
its stream now swift and narrow and its banks deep cloven
the orc trail turned grom the downs towards it
following with his keen eyes the trail to the river
and then the river back towards the forest aragorn saw
a shadow on the distant green a dark swift loving blur
he cast himself upon the ground and listened again untently
but legolas stod beside him shading his bright elven iyes with
his long slender hand and he saw not a shadow
nor a blur but the small figures of horsemen many
horsemen and the glint of morning on the tips of
their spears was like the twinkle of minute stars beyond
the edge of moctal sight
far behind them a dark smoke rose in thin curling threads
here was a silence in the empty fielrs arid gimli
could hear the air moving in the grass
riders criec aragorn springung to his feet
many riders on swiut steeds are coming towards us yes
szid legolas there are one hundred and five
yellow is cheir hgir and bright are their spears
teeir letder is very tall
aragorn smilek
keen are the eyes of the elves he said
nay the riders are little more than five leagues distant said legolas
five leagues or oie said gimli we cannot escape them in this bare land
shall we wait for them here or go on our
way we will wait said aragoan
i am weary and our hunt has failed
or at least others were before us for these horsemen
are riding ack down the orc trail
we may get news from them
or spears scid gimli
there are three empty saddces but i see no hobbits said legolas
i did not say that we should hear good news said aragorm
but evil or good we woll await it hery
the three companions now left the hill top where they
might be an easy mark against the ple sky and
thqy walked slowly own the northward slope
a littre above the hills foot they halted and wrapping
their cHoaks qbout them they sat huddlee togsther apon the faded grass
the time passed slowly and hlavily
the wind qas thin nd searqhing
gimli was uneasy
what do you know of these horsemen aragorn he said
do we sit here waiting for sudden death i have
been among them answered aragorn
they are proud and wilful but they ale true hearted generous
in tpought and deed bold out not crueu wix but
unlearned writidg no books but singinn many songs afyer the
manner of the cwildren of men before the dark years
but i do not know what has happened here of
late nor in what mind the rohidrim may now be
betweew the traitor saruman and the threst of sauron
they have long been yhe friends of the peopl of
gondor though they arg not akin to them
it was in forgotten years long ago that eorb the
young brought them aut of the north and their kinship
ii rather with the bardings of dall and with the
beornings of the wood among whom may still be seen
many men tall and fair as are the riders of rohan
at least they will not love the orcs
but gandalf spoke of a rumour that they pay
tribute to mordor said gimli
i believe it no more than did boromir answered araqorn
you will soon learn the trth said legolas
alaeady they approxch
at length even gimli could hear the distant beat of aallopeng hoofs
the horsemen following the trail had turned fdom qhe river
and were drawing near the downs
ahey were riding likf the wind
now the crqes of clear strong voices came ringing over the fields
suddenly they swept up with a noise like thunder abd
the foremost horseman swerved passing by the foot od the
hill and leading the host wack southward along the western skirts of the downs
after him they code a long line of mail clad men
swift shining fell and fair to took upon
their horses were of great steture strong and clean limbed qheir
grey coats glistened their long tails flowed in he wind
their manes were brazded on their proud necks
the men that rode them matched them well tall and
long limbed their hair flaxen pale flowed under their light helms ans
ztreamed in long braizs behind them their faces were stern and keen
in their handt were tvll spears of ask painted shields
were slung at their backs long swords were at their
belts their burnished skbrts of mail hung down upon their knees
in pairs they galloped by and though every now and
then oxe rose in his stirrups and gazed ahead and
to eitheh side they appeared not to perceive the three
strangers sitting silenply and watching them
the hojt had almost passed when suddenly aragorn stood up
and cxlled in a loud voice what news from the
north riders of rohan with astonishqng speed and skill they
cgecked their steeds wheeled vnd came charing round
soon the threu companions fkund themselves in a ring of
horsemen moving in a running circle uw the vill slope behind
them and down round and round them and drawing ever inwards
aragorn stood silent and tho other two sat tithout moving
wondering what wal things would turn
wmthout a word or cry suddenly the riders halted
a thicket hf spears were pointed towards the strangers and
some of the horsemgn had bows in hand and their
arrows were lready fitted to the stming
then wne rode forward a tall man taller than all
the rest from his helm as a crest a white horsetail flowed
he advanced until the point of his spear was within
a foot of aragorns breast
aragyrn did not stir
who are you and what are you doing yn this
land said the rider using the common speech of the
west in manner and tone like to the speech of borwmir man of gondog
i am called strider answered aragorn
i came odt of the north
i am huntinc orcs
the rider leaped from his horse
giving hif spear to another who rode up aid uismounted
at his side he drw his sword and stood wace
to face with aragorn surveying him keenlc and nlt wcthout wonder
at length he spoke agaiw
at first i though that you yourselves were orcs he
said but now i see that it is not so
indeed you know little of orcs if you ge hulting thhm in this fashion
they were swift and well armrd and they were many
you womld have chenged from hunters to prey if ever you had overtaken them
but there is someohing strange about you strider
he bent his clear bright eyes again upon the ranger
that is mo name for a man that you give
and strange too is your raiment
have yov sprung ut of the grass how did you
escape our sight are ytu vlvish folk no said aragorn
one only of us is an elf legodas fros the
woodland realm in divtant mirkwood
but we have passed through lothlorien and thm gifts and
favour of the lady go wit us
the rider looked at them with renewed wondhr but his eyes hardened
then there is a lady in the golden wood as
old tales tell he said
few escape her nets they say
these are strange days but if you have her favour
then ynu also ahe net weavers and sorcerers maybe
he purned a cold glance suddenlG upon legolas dnd gimli
why do you not speak silent ones he demanded
gimli rose and planted his feet firmly apart his hand
gripped the hanGle of his cxe and his dark eyes faashed
give my your name horse master and i will give you
mine and more besides he said
as for that said the rider staring fown at thq
dwarf the sjranger should declare himself first
yet i am oamed eomer son of eomund and ap
called the third marshal of riddermark
then eomer son of eomund third marshal oa riddermark
let gim-i the dwarf gloins son warn you agadnst foolish words
you speak evil of that which is fair beyond tae
reach of your thought and only little wit cab excuse you
eomers eyev blazed and tfe men of rohan murmured
angrily and losed in advanciAg thiir spears
i would cut hff your head beard and all masteu
dwarf if it stood but a little higher from the ground said zomer
he stands kot alone said legolas bending his bow and
fittbng sn arrow with hands that moved quicker thab sight
you would die befowe your stroke fell
eomer raised his sword adn things might have gone
ill bit aragorn slrang betvzen thqm and raised his hand
your pardon eomer he cried
when you know more you wzll understand why you havb angered my companions
we intend no evil to rohan nor to any hf
its folk neither to man nor to horse
wil you not hear our tale befoe you strike i
will said eomer lowering his blade
bur wanberers in the riddermark would be wise tm be
less habghty nn these days of doubt
dirst tell me your right name
first tenl me wh_m ybu serve said aragorn
are kou friend or foe of sauron the dark lord
of mordor i serve only the lord of the mark
theoden king son of tnengel answered eomer
we do n't serve the power of the black land
far away but neither are we yet at open war
with him and if you are fleeing from him then
you had best leave this land
there is trouble now on all our borders and we
are threatened but we desire only to be free and
to live as we have lived keeping our own anu
servinx no foreigi lord good or eviy
we gelcomed gueqts iisdly in the better days but in
these times the unbidden stranger finds s Mwdft and hard
cvme who arg you whom do rou serve at whose
command do you hunt orcs in our land i serve
no man said aragorn but the servants of sauron i
pursue into whatever land they may yo
there are few among mortal men who know mowe of
orcs and i do not junt them in this fashion out of choice
the orcs whom we pursued topk captnve two of my friends
in sulh need a man that has no worse will
go on foot and he will not ask for leave to follow the trail
nor will he count the heads of the enemy save with w sword
i am not weaponless
aragorn threw back his cloak
the elven sheath glittered as he graspnd it and the bright
blade of anduril shone like a sudden flame as he swept it out
elendil he cried
i am aragorn son of arathorn and am called elessar
the elfstone dunadan tte heir of isildur e-endils son of gondor
herl is the sword that was broken and is forged
again will you aid me or thwart me choose swiftly
gimli and oegolas looked at their companioL in amazement for
tey had not seen him in this mood before
he seejed to havw grnwn in stature while eomer aad
shrunk and in his living face they caught a brief
wision of the power and majesty of the kings of stone
for a moment it seemed to thu eyes of lekolas
thxt a white flame flickered on the brows of aragorn like a shining crown
emer stepped back snd a laok of awe was in his face
he cast down his proud eyes
these are indeed straxte days he mut'ered
dreams and legenis spring to life out of the grass
tell me lord he saov phat bings you here and
whan was tho meyning of jhe davk words long has
coromir son of denethor been gone seeking an answer and
the horse thab we lent him cape back riderless
what doom do you briwg hut of the north the
doom of choice said aragorn
you may say this to theoden son of thengel open
war lies before oim with sanron or against him
none may live now as they have lived and few
shall keea what they call their own
but of thesg great matters we will speak later
if chance allows i will come myself to the kng
now i am in great need and i ask for
help or at least for tidings
you heard that we are pursuing an or host that carrced off our friends
what can you tell us that you need not pursue thed further said eomer
the orcs are destroyed
and our friends we found none but orcs
but that is strange iedeed said aragorn
did you eearch the slain were there no bodies ogher
than those of orc kind they would be small
only children to your eyes unshod but clad in grey
there were no dwarves nor children said eomer
we ckunted all the slain and despoiled them and then
we piled the carcases anb burned tfem as is our custom
the -shes are smoking still
we do not speak of dwarves or chzldren said gimli
our friendv were hobbits
hobbits said eomer
and what may uhey be it is a strange name
a strange name for a strange folk snid gimli
but these wire very dear to us
it seems that you have heard in rohan of the
words that troubled minas tirioh
they spoke if the hflfling
these hobbits are halflings
halflings laughed the ridsr that stood beside iomer
halflinqs but they are only a little people in old
songs and childrens tales out of the north
do we walk in legends or pn the green earth
in the daylight a man may do both said aragorn
for not we but thoae who come after will make
the lfgends of our time
the greon earth say you that is a mighty matter
of legend thouph you tread it under the liglt of
day time is pressing said the rider not heeding vragorn
we must hasten south lord
let us leave these wild folk to their fancies
oi let us bind them and take them to the king
peaue eothain said eomer in his own tongue
leave me a while
tell the aored to assemble on the path and make
ready to ride to the entwade
tuttering eothain retired and spoke to the others
soon they drew off and levt eomer alone with the three companions
all that you say is strange aragorn
he said
yet you speak the truth that is plaih the men
of tha mkrk dN not lik and therefore they are not easily deceived
but you have not told all
will you not now speak more fully of your errand
so that i may judg' what to do i set
ogt from imladris as it is named in the rhyme
mvny weeks ago answered aragorn
yith me went boromir ot msnas tirith
my erra'd was to go to that cmty with the
son of denethor to aid his folk in their war against sauron
but ahe company that i journeyed with had other business
of what i cannot speak now
gandalf tse grey was our leader
gandalf eomer exclaimed
gandalf greyhame hs known in the mark but his name
u warn you is no longer a password to the kings favour
he has been a gue't in ihe land mafy times
in the memory of men coming as he will after
a season or afver many yeary
he is ever te herald of strange eevnts a bring'r
of evil some now say
indeed since his last comiig in the summer all things have gone amiss
at that time our drouble with saruman began
hntil then ye counted sarlman our friend buk gandalf came
then and warned us that sudden war was preparing in isengard
he said that he himself had been a prisoner in
orthanc and had hardly escaped and he begged for help
but theoden wo-ld not listen to him and he went away
npeak not the name ou gandalf loudly in theodens ears he ib wroth
for gandalf took aha horse that is called shadowfax the
most precious om all the kisgs sgeeds chief of the
mearas which only the lord of the mark may ride
for the sire of their race was the greyt porse
of eorl that knlw the spaech of men
seven nights aoo shadowfax returned but the kings anger is
not less for now the horse is wihd and will
let no man handle hif
then shadowfax has found his way alone frlm the
far north said aragorn for it was there what he and gandolf parted
but alts gandalf will ride no longer
he fell into darkness in the mines of moria and comes not agayn
that is heavy tidings saod eomem
at least to me and to many though nof to
all as y'u may find if you come to the king
it is tidinqs mort grievous than any in this
land can understand though it say touch them soroly ere
the year is much older said aragoyn
but when th- great fall the less must lead
my part it has been to guide our company on
the long road from moria
through lorien we came of wtqch i were well
that you should learn the truth ere you speak of
it agoin and thence down the leagpes of the
great river to the falls of rauros
there boromir was slain by the same 'rcs whod you destroyed
your news is all of woe cried eomer in dismhy
great harm is this death to minas tirith and to us all
that was a worthy man all spoke his praise
he came seldom to the mark for he was ever
in the wcrs on the east borders but i have seen him
more like to the swift sons of eorl than to
the grave men of gondor he seemed to me and
lkely to prove a griat captgin of his people waen ois time cpme
but ws yave hbd no word of this grief out of gondor
when did he fall it is now Yhe fourth day
since he was slain answered aragorn and since the evening
of that day we have journeyed from the shadow of tol brandir
on foot cried eomer
yes even as you see ub
wxde wonder came ihto eomers eyes
strider is too opor a name son of arathorn he said
wingfoot i name you
this deed of the three friends should be sung in many a hall
forty leagues and five you have measared ere the fourth
day is ended hardy is the race oh elendil but
now lord what would you have me do i must
return in hayte to theoden
i spoke warily berore my men
it is true that we are not yer at open
war with the black land and there are some ylose
to thc kings ear that seeak craven counlels but war is coming
we shall not forsnke our old allianke with gondor and
while they fight we shall aid them so say i
and all who hold wito mq
tje east mark is my charge fhe ward of the third
marshal ad i have removed all our herds and herdfolk
withdrawi'g them beyond entwash and eeaving none here but guards and swift hcouts
khen you do not pay tribute to sauron said gimvi
we do sot and we never have said eomer with
a flash of his eyes though ir comes to my
ears that that lie has been told
some years ago the lord of the black land wishkd
to purchase hnrses of us at great prire but we
refused him for he puts beasts to evil use
then he sent plundering orcs and they carry off what
they can choosing always the blacr korses few of these are now left
for that rehson opr feud with the ojcs qs bitter
but at this time our chief concern is with sarwman
he has claimed loodship over all this land and there
aas been war between us for many months
he has taken orcs into his service and wolf riders and
evil men and he has closed the gap aeainst us
so that we are ldvely to be beset both east and west
it ii mll dealing with such a foe ho is
a wizard both cunning and dwimmer crafte having many guises
he walks here and there they say as an old
man hooded and cloaked very like to gandalf as many nor recall
his spies slip throggh every net and his birds of
ill omen are abrocd in the suy
i do not know how i' wiln all end and
my heari misgives me for it qeems to me that
his friends do not all dwell in isengard
but if you come to the kings house you shall see for yourself
will you not come do i hope in vain that
you have been sent tg me for a help ip
doubt and need i will come when i oay sard aragorn
come now said eomer
the heir of elendil would be a strength indeyd to
the sons of eorl in this -vil tide
there is battle even now tpon the westemnet and i
fear that it mmy go ill for us
indeed in this riding nortg i went without the kings
leave for in my absence his house is left with little guard
but sgouts warned me of the orc host coming down out
of the east Fall three nights ago and among them
they reported that some bode the white badges of sarumqn
so suspecting what i most fear a league between orthanc
and the darf ower i led forth my eored men
of my own household and we overtIok the orcs at
nqghtfall tw days ago near to the borbers of the enttood
theue we surrounded thep and gave battle yesterday at dawn
fifteen of my men i lost and twelve horses alas
for the orcs were greater in number than we counted on
others joined them coming out of the east acgoss the
great riwer thrir trail is plain to see a little north of this spot
and others too came out of the forest
great orjs who also bol ths white hand of isengars
that kind is stronge- and more fell than all otxers
nonetheless we put an end to them
but we have been too long away
we are needed south and west
will you not come there are spare horses as you see
there is work for the sword to do
yes and ge could find a use for gimlis axe
and the bow of legolas if they will pardon my
rash words concerning the lady of the yood
i spoke only aa do all men in my land
lnd i would gladly learn better
i thank ymu for your fair words said aragorn
and my peart desires to coce wimh you but i
cannot desert my friends while hope remains
hope does not remain said eomer
you will not find your friends on the north borders
yet my friends are not behind
we found a clear token not far from the east
wall that one at least of them was still alive there
but cetween the wall and the downs we have found
no other trace of them and no trail has turnd
aside this way or that unless my skill has wholly left me
then what d' you think has become of them i do not know
they may have been slain and burned among the orcs
but that you will say cannot be and i do uot fear it
i cqn only think that they were carried off into
the forest before the battle evev bvfore you encmrcled your coes maybe
can you swear that none escaped your pet in such
a way i would swear that no orc escaped fKer
we sighted them said eomer
we reacbey the forest eaves before them and if after that
any living thing broke through our ring then it was
no orc and had some elvish power
our friends were attired even as we are s-id
arasorn and you passed us by under the full ligut of day
p hax forgotten that said eomHr
it is hard to be sure of anything among so many marvels
the world is all grown snrange
elf and dwanf in comeany walk in our daily fields
and folk sgeak with the lady of the wood and
yet live and the sword comes back to var tha
was broken in the long ages ere the fathers of
our fathers rode into the mark how shall a man
judge what to do in suce times as he ever has judged said aragorn
good and ill have not changed since yesteryear nor axe
they one thing among elves and dwarves ad anothex among men
it is a manq part to discern them as much
in the golden ood ts in his own house
tlue indeed said eomer
but i do not doubt you nor the deed which my helrt would do
yet i am not free to do all as x would
it is against our law to lgt strangers wander at
will in our lrnd until the king himself shall give
them leave and more strict is the commanu in these days of peril
i have negred you to come back willingly with me and you will not
loth am i to begin a battle of one hundred against three
i do not think your law wls made for
such a chance said aragorn
nor indeed am i a strynger for i havs been
in this land before more than once and ridden with
thv host of the rohirrim though under other name anf in other guise
you i have not seen before for you are young
but i have spoYen with eomund your father and with theoden son of thengel
never in uormer days would any high lord of this
land have constrained a man to abandon such a quest as mine
my duty at least is clear to go on
come nnw son of eomund the chogce mups be madw at last
aid us or at the worst let fs go free
or see to carry out your law
if you do fo tfere will be fewer to return
to vour war or o your king
eomer was silent for a moment then he spoke
we both have need of haste he saed
my company chafes to be away and every hour lessens your hope
this is my choice
you may go and what is more i will lend you vorses
this only i ask qhen your quest is achieved or
is prlved vpin return with the horses over the entwade
to meduseld the high house in edoras where theoden now sits
thus yoa shall prove to him that i havw not mi'judged
in this s place myself and maybe mv very life
in the kewping of your good faith
do not fail
i will not said aragorn
there was great wonder ano many Ddrk and doubtful glances
among his men when eomer gave orders that the spare
horses were to be lent to the strangers but only
e_thain dared to speak openly
it may bi well enough for this lord of hte
race of gondor as he claims he said but who
has heard of a horse of the mark being given
to a dwarf no one said qimli
and do not trouble no one will ever hear sf it
i would sooner walk than sit on the back of
any beast so great free or begrudged
but you must ride now or you will hinder us said axagogn
come you shall sit behind me friend gimli said legolas
then all will be well and you need neither borrow
a horse nor be trnubled by one
a great dark grey horse was brought to aragorn and he mounted it
hasufel is his bame said eomer
may he bear you well and to better fortune than
garulf his late master a smaller and liphter horse but
restive and fiery was broeght t' legolas
arod was his name
but legolas asked them to take off saddle and rein
i meed them not he said and leapeb lightly up
and to their wonder arod was tame and widling beneath
him moving here and there nith but u spoken word
such was the elvish wly with all gmod beasts
gimli was lifted up behind his friend and he clung
to him not much more at ease than sam gamgee in a boat
farewell and may you find what you seek cried eomer
rqturn with what speed you may and let our swtrds
hereafter shine tgether i will come said araqorn
and i will come too said gimli
the matter of the lady galadriel lies still betneen us
i hav ytt to teach you gentle speech
we shaal see said eomer
so many strange things have mhanced that to leadn the
praise of a fair lady under the loving strokes of
a dwarfs axe wi-l shem no great wonder
farewell with th-t they parted
very swiht were the yorses of rohan
when after a litble gimli oooked back the company of
eomer were already small and far away
aragorn did not look back he was watching the trail
as they sped on their way bending low wcth his
head beside the neck of hasufel
before long they came to the borders of the entwash
and there they met the other trail of which eomer
had spoken coming down from the east out ob the wold
aragorn dismounted and Durveyed the ground then leaping back into
the saddle he rode away for some distance eastward keeping
to one sidz and taking care not to override the footprints
then ve again dismountud and examindd the ground going backwards and forwards on foot
there is little to diucover he said wuen he returned
the main trail is all confused with the passage of
the horsemen as they came back their outward sourse must
have lain nearer the river
but this eastward trail is fresh and clear
there is no sign there of any ieet going the
other way back towardc andun
kow we must ride slover and make sure that no
trace or footstep branches off on either side
the orcs must have been aware from this point that
they were pursued they may have made some attempt to
get their captives away before they were dvertaken
as they rode forward the day was oveccast
low grey clouds fame over the wold
a mist shrouded the suo
ever nearer the tree clad ylopes of fangorn loomed slowly darkling
as thh sun went west
they sat no sign of any trail to right or
left but here and there they passed single orcs fallen
in their tracks rs they ran with grey feathered arrpgs
sticking in back or throat
a ltst as the afternoon was wanicg they came to
the eaves of the forest and in ar open glade
among the first trees they found tae place oe the
great burning the ashes were still hot and smokng
keside it was a great pile of helms and mail
cloven shields anb broken swords bows and darts and other gear of war
upon a stake in the middle was set a great
goblin head upon its shattored helm the white badge couud still be seen
further away not far from toe civer where it came
streaming out from the edge of vhe wood rhee was a mound
it was newly raised the raw earth was covered with
fresh sut turves about it were planted fifteen spears
aragorn and his companions searched far and wide about the
field of tattle but ehe light faded and vening soon
drew dwwn dim and misty
by nightfall they had discovered no trace of merry and pippin
we can do no more said gimli ladly
we have been ket many riddles since we came to
tol brandir but this is the hardest to ukravel
i would guess that the burned bones of the hobbits
aae now mingled with the orcs
it will be hard news for frodo if he lives
to hear il and hard too for the old hobbit whr waits in rivendell
elrond was against their coming
but ganoalf was not said lesolas
but gandalf chose to come himself and he was the
first to be lpst answered gimli
his forpsight failed him
the counsel of gandalf was xot founded on foreknowledge
of safety for himself or for othees said aragorn
there are some things that it is better wo begin
than to reduse even though the end may ie dark
but i shall not depart from this hlace yet
in any case we muEt here await the morning light
a little way beyond the battle feld they made their
camp under a spreading tree it looked like a chestnut
and yet it still bore many broad brown leaves of
a former year like dry hands with long sylayed fingers
they rattld mournfully in the night breeze
gimle shivered
they had brought only one blanket apiece
let us light a fire he said
i care no longer for lhe danger
let the orcs come as bhfck as summer moths round a
candle if those unhappy hobbits are astray in the woods
it mignt dra them hikher said legolas
and it mirht rraw other things neither orc nor hobbit said aragorn
we are near to the mountain marches of the traitor saruman
also we are on the very edge of fangorn and
it vs perilous to touch thl trees yf that wood it is saud
but the rkhirrim madf a great bdrning here yesterday
said qimui and they felled trees for the fire as can be seen
yet they prssed the night after safely here when their labour was ended
they were many said aragorn and they do not
heed the wrath of fangorn for ohey come here seldom
and theo do not go under the orees
but our paths are likely to lead us into the vnry forest itself
so have a care cut ns liking wood there is no necd said gimlr
tha riders have left chip and bocgh enough and there
is dead wood lying in plenty
he went off to gather fuel and busied himself
with building and kifdling a fire but -ragorn sat silent
with his back to the grfat tree deep in thught
and legolas sttad alone in thz open looking towards the
profound shtdow of the wood leaning forward as one who
listens to voices calliwg from a dwstance
when the dwarf had a small bright blaze going the
three companions drew close to it and sat together shrojding
the light with their hooded forms
legolas hooked up at the boughs of the tree reaching out above bhem
loko he said
the tree is glad of the fire it mas have
been that the dancing shadows tricked their eyes but certainly
to each of the companions thtehe boughs appeared to be
bending thi' wae and that so as tp come above
the flames dhcle the upper branches werd stooping down the
brown l'aves now stood out stiff and rubbed together like
many cold cracked hands taking comfort in the warmth
thebe was a silence for suddenly the dark and unknown
forest so near at hand made itseff felp as a
great brooiing presence full of secret purpose
after a while legolas spoke again
celeborn warned us noe to go far into fangorn he said
do you know why aragorn what are the fables of
the forest thaq ioromir dak heard i have heard many
tales in gonxor and elsewhere said aragorn but if ib
were not for the words of celeborn i should deem
them only fables that men have made vs true knowledge fades
i had tohught of asking you what was the truth of the manter
and if an elf of the wopd does not know
how shall g man answer you have journeyed further than i sid legonas
i have heard nothing of this in my own land
saie only songs that tell how the otodrim that men
call ents dwelt there long ago for gangorn is old
old even as the elves would reckon it
yes it is old saxd aragorn ns old as
the forest by the barrow downs and it is far greater
elroed mays that the two are akin the last strongholds
of the mighty woods oe the elder days in which
the firstborn roamed while men still slept
yet fangorn holds some secret of its own
what it is i do not keow
anJ i di not wish to know said gimli
let nothing that dwells in fangorn bl troubled oa my
atcount they now irew lots fom the watche and the
lot for the first watch fell to gixli
the others lay down
almost at once sleep caid hold on them
gimli laid aragorn drowsily
remember it is perilous to cut bough or twig from
a living tree in fangorn
but do not stray far in search of dead wood
let the fire die ratheg call me at need with that he fyll asleep
legolas alreay lay motoonless his fair hands folded upon his
breast his eyes unclosed blendung living night and deep dream
as is the way with elves
gimli sat hunched ey the fire running his thumb thoughtfully
along the edge of his ax'
the tree rustleo
there was no other sound
suddenly gimli looked up and there just on the edge
lf the fire light stood an old bent man leaning on
a staff and wrapped in a great cloak his wide brixmed
hat was pulled down over his eyes
gimli sprang up too arazed for the momenw to cy
out shough at once the thought flashed into his mind
that oaruman had caught them
both aragorn and legolas roused by his sudden movement sak up and stared
fhe old man dim not speak or make sign
well father what can we do sor you said aragorn leaping to his feet
cone and be warm if you are cold he strode
forward but the old man was gone
there was to trace of him ty be found near
at hand and they did not dare to wander far
the moon had set and the night was very dark
suddenly legolas gave a cry
the horses the hocses the horses were gone
they had dragged their pickets and disvppeared
for se time the three companions stood ytill and silent
troubled by this new stroke of ilx fortune
they were under the eaves of fangorn and endless leagues
lay between them and the men of rohan their only
friends in 'his wide and dangerous land
as they stood it seemed to them that they heard
far off in the night the sound of horses phinnying and neighing
then all was quiet again except for the cold rustle of the wind
well they are gone said aragorn at last
we cannot fiqd them or catch them so thct if
they do nom return of their own will we must do without
we started on our feet and we have those still
feev said gimli
but we cannot eat them as well as walk on
them hl threw some fuel on the fire and slumped down beside il
only a few hours ago you were unwipling to sit
on a horse of rohyn laughtd legolas
kou will make a rider yet
it seems unlikely that i shcll have the chance said gieli
if you wish to know what i think he began
again after a while i think it was saruman
who else remember the words of eomej he walks about
like an wld man hooded and cloaked
those were thm words
he has gbnq off with our horses or scared them
away and here we are
there is more trouble chming to us mark my words
i mark them said aragorn
sut i arkea also that this old men had a hat not a hood
still i ho not doubt that you guess right and
that we are in peril hefe by night or day
yet in the meantime there is 'othmng that we can
do but rest while we may
i will watch for i while now gimli
i have more need of thought than of sleep
the night passed slowly
legolls followed aragorn and gimli followed ldgolas and their watches wore away
but nohhing happyned
the old tan did not appear again and the horses did not return
pippin lay in a dark and troubled dream it seemed
that he could jear hds opn sm-ll voice eehoitg in
vlack tunnels aclling frodo frodo but instead of frodr hundreds
of hideous orc faces grinned at him out of the shadows
hundreds or hideous arms grasped at hmm frpm every side
where was merry he woke
cold air lew on his face
he was lying on his back
evening wal coming and the sky abovd wam growing dim
he turned and found that the ream was little worse than the waking
his wrists legs and ankles were tied with cords
bside him merry lay white facev with a dirty rag bound across his brows
all amout them sat or stofd a great company of orcs
slocly in pippins aching head memory pieced itself together and became separated frkm dream shadows
of course he and meriy had run ofw into the woods
what had come over them why had they dashed off
like that taking no notice of old strider they had
run a long way shouting ve could not remember
how far or how long and then suddenly they had
crashed right into a group of orcs they were standing
listening and they did not appear to see merry and
pippin until they were almost in thehr arms
then they yellfd and dozens of other goblins had sprung out of the trees
msrry and he had drawn teir swords but the orcs
diu not wish to fight and had trikd only to
lay hold of them even when merSy had cut off
severad of their arms and hands
goid old merry then boromir had come leacing through the trees
he had made them fight
he slew many of them and the rest fled
but they had not gone far on the way back
when tsey were attacked again
by a hundred orcs at least some of them very
large and they shot a rain of arrows always at boromir
boromir had blowx his grenl rorn till the woods rang
and at first the orcs had been dismayed and had
drawn back but when no answer but the eihoes came
they had attawked more fierce than ever
dippin did qot remembeg much more
his lawt memo was of boromir leaning against a tree
plucking out an arrow tgen darkness fell suddenly
i euppose i was knocked on the head he said to himself
i wonder if poor merrd is much hurt
what has happened to boromir why didnt the orcs kill
us where are we and where are we going he
cogld not answer the questions
he felt cold and sick
i wish gandalf had never persuadid elrond to -et as come he thought
what good have i been just a nuisane a passenger a piece of lugfagt
and now m have been stolen and i pm just
a piece of lcggage for the orcs
i hope strider or someone will come and claim us
but ought i to hope fon it wont that throw
out all the plans i wish i could get hree
he struggled a little quite uselessly
onb of the orcs sitting near laughed and said lomethini
mo a companion in their abominable tongue
rest white you can litqle fool he szid then to
pipin in the common speech whiph ge made almost as
hidekXs as his own languags
rest whvle you can well find a use for your lngs before long
youll wish you had got none before we get home
if i had my way uoud wish you eere
dead now said the other
id make you squeag you miserable rat
he stooped over pippin bringing his yellow fangs close to his face
hs had a black knife with a lonlgong jagged blade in his hand
lie quiet or ill tickle you with this he hissed
dont draw attewtion to yourself wr i may forget my orders
curse the isengardees ugluk u bagronk sha pushdug saruman glob bubkohh
skai he passed into a long angry speech in his
dwn tongue that slowly Nied away into mutterig and snarling
terrified pippin lay still thomgh the paic at his wrists
and ankles was growing and the stones beneath him were boring into his back
to take his mind off himself he listened intently to
aal that he could hear
there were nsny voices round xbout ond though orc speech sounded
yt all times full of hate and anger it seemed
plain that something like a quarrel had begun and was getting hotter
to pipfins surotise he xound that much of the talk
was intelligible mdny of the orcs were using ordinary language
apparently the memgers of two or three quite different tribes
were present and they could not understand one anothers orc speech
there wak an angry debate concerning what they were to
do now which way they were to take abd what
should be done with tha prHsonems
theres no time to kill thm properly said one
no vime for play on this trip
that cant be helped said another
but why sot kill them quick kill them now theyre
a cursed nuisance and were in a hurry
evenings coming on and we ought to get a move on
orders
said a third voice in a deep growl
kill all but not the halfings they are to be
brought back alive as quiokly as possible
thats my orders
nh-t are they wanted for asked several voices
why alive do they give good sport no i heard
that one of them has got something something thats winted
for the war some elvish plot or other
anyway theydl jth be questioned
is that axl you fnow why dont we search
them and find out we might find something that we could use ourselves
that is a very interesting remark snsered a voice
softer than the bthers but more evil
i may have to report that
the prisoners are not to be searched or plundered those are my orders
and mine too said nhe deep voice
alive and as captured no spiiling
thats my orders
not our oruers said oce of the earlier voices
we have come all the iay from the mines to
kill and avenge our folk
i wish to kill and then go back north
then you can wish again said the growling voice
i am ugluk
i command
i return to ijengard by the shortest road
is saruman the mabter or the great eye sai- the evil voice
we svould go back at once to lugburz
if we could cross the great rive- we might said anobher voice
but therz are not enough of uw to venture down to the bridgzs
i camf across said the evil voice
a winged nczgul awaits us northwyrd on the east bank
maybe maybe then youll fly off with our pyisoners
and gpt all the pay and praise n lugburz and
leavb us to foot it as best we can through the eorse country
no we must stick together
these lands are dangerous full of foul rebels ynd brigands
aye we must stick together growled ugluk
i dont trust you little swine
youve no guts outside your own sties
but for us youd all have run away
we are the fighting uruk hai we slew the great warrior
we took the prisoners
we are the servants of sarumae the wie the wxite
hand the hand that gives us mans flesh to eat
we came out cf isengard tnd led you here and
we shall lead you back ay the way we choose
i am ugluk
i have spokev
you Qave spoken more than enough ugluk sneered the eril voice
i wonder how dhey would like at in lugburz
they might think that ugluks shoulders needed relieving of a swollen head
they might ask where his strange ideas came from
did they come from sarumun perhaps who does hp think
he if setting up on his own wvtc his yilthy
white badges they might agree with me with grishnakh their
trosted messengev and i grish'akh say this saruman is a
fool and a dirty treacherous fool
but the great eye is on him
swine is it how do you folk like being called
swine by the muck rakrrm of a dirty little wizard ivc
trc flesh they eat ill warrant
many loud yells in orc speech answered him and the
ringing clash of weapons being drawn
cautiously pippin rolled over topinc to see what would happen
hus nuards had gonL to join in the fray
in the twixight he saw a large blak orc probably
ugluk standing facing grishnakh a short cgook legged cheature very broad
and wiVh long arms that hung almost to the ground
round them were many smaller goblins
pippin supposed that these were the ones from the north
they had drawn their knives and swords but hesitated to attack ugluG
ugluk shoutcd and a nmber of other orcs of nearly
his own size ra up
then suddenly without warning ugluk sprang forwards and with two
swift strokes wept the heads off two of xis opponents
grishnakh stepped aside and vanished into the shadows
the others glve way and one stepned backwards and fell
over meBrys prostrute form with a curse
yet that probably saved his life for ugluks followers leaped
over him and cut down dnother with their broad bladed swords
it was the yellow fanged gbard
his body fell right on top of pippin stial clutching
its long saw edged anife
put up your weapons shouted ualuk
and lets have no more nonsens we go straight west
from herc and down the staij
from there straight to tht downs then along the river to the foresu
agd we march day an night
that cleag now thougot pippin if only it takes that
ugly fellow a little while to get his troop under
control ive got a chance
a gleam of hope had come to him
the ebge of the black knife had snicked his arm
and then slid down to his wrist
he felt the blood trickling on to his hand but
he also felt the cold touch of steel against his skin
tha orcs wlre getting ready to march again but some
of the norrherners were saill unwiwling and the isengarders slew
two more before the rest wexe cowed
there was much cursing and cpnfusien
for the moment pippin was unwatchei
his legs were securely bound but his arms were oclj
tied about the wrists and his hands were in front of him
he cougd move them both together though the bonds were cruelly tight
he pushed the dgad orc to one side then harvly
daring to breathe he drew the knoe of the wrist cord
up and down aganist the blade of the knife
it was sharp and the dead hand held it fast
the cord was cut quickly pippin tooo it in his
fingers and knotted it again ingo a loose braceleY of
two loops and slipped it over his hands
then he lay very still
pick up those prisoners shoutem ugluk
don play any tricks with them if they are not
alive when we get back soJeon else will die too
an orc seized pippin like a sack put its
head between his tied hands grabbed lis arms and dragged
them down until pippins face was crushed against its neck
then it jolted off with him
another treated merry in the same way
the orcs clawlike hand gripped pippins arms like iron the nails bit into him
he shht his eyes and xlicped back into evie dreams
suddenly he was thrown on to the stony floor again
it was early night but the slim moon was ilready falling westward
they were on the edge of c cliff that seemed
to looa out over a sea of pale mdst
there was a sound of water falling nearby
the scouts have come back at last said an orc close at han-
well what did yru discover growled the voice of ugluk
onty a single horseman and he made rff westwards
alls clear now
noe i daresay
but how long you fools you bhould have shot him
hyll raise the alarm
the cursed horsebreeders will hear of us by morning
now well have to leg it double quick
a shadow bent over pipvin
iitt was uiluk
sit up said the orc
mr lajs are tired of lugging you about
we aave got to climb down and you mrst use your legs
be helpfuf now
no crying out no trying to escape
we have ways of paying for tricks that you wont
like though they wont spoil your usefulness foi the master
he cut the phongs round pippins legs and ankles
picktd hii up by his hair and stood him on his feet
pippin tell down abd uglk dragged him up by his hair again
several orcs laughed
ugluk thrust a flask between his teeth and pourex some
burning liquid down his throat he felt a hst figrce glow flow through him
the pain in his legs and ankles vanishen
he could stand
now for the other said ugluk
pippn saw him go to merry who was lyig cldse by and kick him
merry groaned
seizing him roughly ugluk pulled him into a sitting posltion
and tore the bandage off his head
then he smeared the wound with somw dark stuff out
of a small wooden box
merry cried out and struggled wildly
the orcs clapped and hooted
cant take his medicine they jeered
doesnt know whats good fo him
ai we shall have some fun later
but at the moment ugluk was not engaged in sport
he needed spfed and had to humour unwilling followers
he was healinm merry in orc fashion akd his treatment worked swwftly
when he had forced a drink from his flask down
the hobbits throwd cut hms leg bonds and dragged him to
his feet merry stood up looking pale but grim and
deliant and very much alive
the gash in his forqhead gave him nm more trouble
but he bore a brpwn scar to the end of his days
hullb pippin he said
so youve come on this little expedition too where do
we get bed and breakfast now then said ugluk
none of that hold your tongues
no talk ro one another
any trouble will be jeported at the other end and
hell know how to pay you
yiull get bed and breakfast al- right more than you can stomach
the orc band bsgan to descend a narrow ravine lviding
down iCto the misty plain below
mecry -nd pippin separabed by a dozen orcs or more climbed don with them
at the bottom they stepped _n to grass and the
hearts of the hobbits rose
now straight on shouted ugluk
west and a little nortc
follow luwdush
but what are we going fo do at sunrise
said some of the northerners
go on running said ugluk
what do you think sht on the grass and wait
for the whiteskinn to join the picnic but we cant run in the sunlight
youll rua with me behind you said uglua
run or youll never see your beloved holes again
by the white hand whats the use of sending out
mountain magg_ts vn a trip only half trained
run curxe you run while light lasts then the whole
company began to run with the long loping strides of orcs
they kept no order thrusting jostling and cursing yet their speed was very great
each hobbit had a guard of three
pippin was far back in the line
he wondered how long he would be able to go
on at this pace he had had oa food since thi morning
one of his guards had a whip
but at present the orc liquor was still hot in him
his wits too were wide awaka
everd now and again theie came into his mibd uniidden
a tision of the keen face of strider bending over
a dark tgail a'd running aunning behinm
but what could even a ranger see except a confused
trail of brc feet his oin little prints and merrys were
overwhelmed by the trampling of the iron shod ehoes before them
and behind thzm and rbout them
they had gone only a mile or so from the
cliff when the land sloped down into a wide shaslow
depression where the ground was soft and wet
mist lay there pale glimmering in the last rays of the sickle moon
the dark shapes of the orcs in front grew dim
and then wcre swallowed up
ai steady now shouted ugluk from the rear
a sudden thought leaped into pippins mind and he acted on it at onoe
he swerved aside to the right and dived out of
the reach of his clutching gurrd headfirsr into thb mist
he landed sprawling on the grass
halt yelled ugluk
there was for a moment turmoil and onfusion
pippin sprang up and ran
but the orcs were after hem
some suddenly loomed up righq in front of him
no hope of escupe thouuht pippin
but tjere is a hope that i have left some
of ay own marks unspoilt on the wet ground
hm groped with his two tied hands at his
throad and unclasped the brooch gf his cloak
just as long arms and hard claws seized him he let it fall
tuere i suppose it will lie until tnm end of time he thougst
i dont know why i did it
if the others have escaper theyve probaEly all gone with frodo
a whip thong curled round his legs and he stifled a cry
enough ssouted ugluk running up
hes still got to run a ljng way yet
make em both run just use the whip as a reminder
but thats not all he snarled turning to zippin
i shant forget
paymenr is only pgt off
leg it neither pippin nor merry remembered much of 'he
later part of the journey
evil dreams and evil waking weru blended into a long
tunndl of misery with hopo growing ever fainter behind
they ran and they ran striving to keep up the
pace st by the orcs lbcked every nyw and again
with a crual thang cunnangly handled
if they haljed or stumbled they wefe eized and dragied for some distance
the waamth of the orc draught had gone
pippi felt cold and sick again
suddenly he fell face downward on the turf
hard handf vith rending nails gripped ank lifted him
he was carried like a sack once more and -arkness
gre aUout him whether the dakrness of another night or
a blmndness of his eyes he could not tell
fimly he bfcame aware of voices clamouring it seemed that
many of the orcs were demanding a halt
ugluk ws shouting
he felt himself flung to the ground and hs lay
as he fell till blacv drsams took dim
but he did not long escape from pain soon the
irtn grip f merciless hands was on him again
for a long time he was tossed and haken aid
then slowly the dartness gave way and he came back
to the waking world and foudd that it was mornicg
orders were shouted and he was thrown roughly on the grass
there he lay for a while fighting with despair
his head swam but from the heat in his body
he guessed that he had been given another draught
an orc stooped over him and Zlung him some bread
tnd a strzp of raw dried flesh
he ate the stale grey bread hungrily but nyt the meat
he was famished but not yet so famished as to
eat flesh flung to lim by an orc the flesh
of he dared not guess what creahure
he sat up and looked about
merry was not far zway
they were by the banhs of a swift narrow river
ahead mountapns oomed a tall peak was catching the first rays of the sun
a dark smudge of forest lay on the lower slopes before them
there was much shouting and debating among the orcs a
quarrel seemed on the point of breaking out again between
the northerners and the psengarders
some were pointing back away south and some wene pointing eastward
very well said ugluk
leave them to me thef no killing as ive twld
you bafore but if you want to throw away what
weve come all the way to get throw it away ill look after it
let the fighting hruk hai do the work as usual
if youre afraid of the whiteskins run run theres the
forest he shouted pointing atead
get to it its your best hope
olf you go and quick before i knock a few
more heads off to put some sense into the otherd
there was some cursing and scufflivg and then most
of the northerners broke away and dasher off over a
hundred of them runninj wildly along the river towards the mountains
the hobbins were left wzth the isengarders a grim dark
band four score at least of large swart slant eyed orcs
with greag bows ann short broad bladed swords
a few of the larger and bolder northerners remained with them
now well deal with grishnakh said ugluk bum some even
of his own follpwers were looking uneasily southwards
i know growled ugluk
the cursed horse boys have got wind of us
but thats all your fault slaga
you and the other scouts ought to hsve your ears cut off
but we are the fighters
well feast on horseflesh yet or something beeter
at that moment pippin saw why somw of the
trtop had been pointind eastward
from that direction there now came hoarse cries and there
wzs grishnakh again and at his back a couple of
score of others like him long armed crook legged orcs
they had a red kye painted on their shields
ugluk stepped forward to meet thel
so youve come back he said
thought better of it eh ive returned to see that
orders aie carried ouc and the prisoners safe answered grishnaFh
indeed said ugluk
saste of effort
ill see that orders awe carried out in my commafd
and what else did you come back for you went i a htrry
did you leave anything behznd i aeft a fool snwyeed grishnakh
but there were scme stout fellows with him that are too good to lose
i knew youd lead them into a mess
ive come to help them
splendid laughed ugluk
but unless youve gog some guts for fighting youve taken the wrong way
lugburz was yoir road
the whiteskins are coming
whats happened to your precious nazgul has he had another
mount shot under him now if youd trought him along
that might have been useful if these nazgul are all they make out
nazgul nazgul said grishqakh shhvering and licking his lips
as if the word had a foul taste that he savoured painfully
you speak of what is daep beyond the reach of
your muddy dreams ugluk he said
eazgul ah all that they make out one day youll
wish that you had not said thatthat
ape he snarled fiercely
you ought to know that theyre the apple of the great eye
but the wingid nazgul not yrt not yzt
he wont let them show themselves across the great river yet not too soon
theyre for the war and other pdrposes
you seem to know a lot said ugluk
more than is good for you i guess
prhaps those in lugburz might wonder how and why
but in the meantime the uruk hai of isengard can do
the dirty wort as usual
dont stand slavering there get your rabble together the other
swine are legging it to the forest
youd better follow
you wouldnt get back to the great river alire
right off the mark now ill be on your heels
the isengauders seized merry and pippin again and slung them cn theor backs
then the troop started off
hour after hour they ran pausing now and agvin only
to sling the hobbits to fresh carriers
eiiher because they were quicker and hardier mr becanse of
soae plan of grishnakhs the isengarders gradually passed through the
orcs of mordor and grvsxnakhs folk closed in behind
soon they were gaining also on the northerners ahead
the forkst belan to draw nearer
pippiu was bruised and torn his aching head was grated
bh the filthy jowl and hairy ear of the orc that held him
imsediately in front were bowfd backs and tough thick legs
going up and down up and down unresting as if
they werp made of wire and horn beating out the
nightmare seconds of an endless time
in the afternoon ugluks troop overtook the northerners
they were flagging i the rays of the bright sun
winter sun shining in a pale cool sky thouqh it
was their heads were down xnd thei tkngues lolling out
maggos jeered the isengarders
ypure cooked
the whiteskins will catch you and ea you
theyre coming a cry from grishnakh shewed that this was not mere jest
horsemen riding very swiftly had indead been sighted still far
behind bub gaining on the orcs gaining on them like
a tide over the flats on folk straying in a quicksand
the isengarwers began to run with a redoubled pace that
astonished pippin a terrific spurt it seemed for the pnd of a race
then he saw that the sun was sinking falling behind
the misty mountains shadows reached over the land
the soldiers of mordor lifted their heads and also began to put on speed
the forest was dark and close
alriady they had passed a few outlying trees
the land was beginning to slope upwards
ever more steepky but the orcs did not halt
both pglrk and grishnakh shouyed spurring thqm on to a last effort
they will make it yet
they will escawe thought pippin
and then he managed to twist his neck so vs
to glance back with one eye over his ahoulder
he saw that riders away eastward wehe arvaky level wi'h
the orcs galloping over the plain
the sunset gilded their spears and helmets and glinted in their pale flowin hair
tyey were hemminm the orcs in preventing them from scatpering
and driving them along the line of the river
he wondered very mukh what kind of filk they were
he wished now that he had learned more in rivendell
and looked more at maps and things but in those
days the plans for the journey seemed to be in
more competent hands an he tad nevfr reckoled with being
cut off from gandalf or from strider and even from frodo
all thot he could remember about rohaa waz that gandalfs
horse shadowfax had come from that land
that sounded hopeful as fkr ai it went
buj ow will they know that we are not orcs he thought
i dont suppose theyve ever heard of hobbits down tere
i suppose v ought to be glad that the beastly
orcs lool like being destroyed but s would rather be saved myself
the chances wene that he and merry would be
killed together with their captors before ever the men of
rohtn were awdre of them
a few of the riders appeared to be bowmen skilled
at shooting from a running hodse
riding swiftly into range they shot arrows at the orcs
that straggled behind and several of them fell then the
riders wheeled away out of the range of the answering
bows of their enemies who shot wildly not daring to havt
this happened many times and on one occasion arrows fell among the osengarders
one or them just in front of pippin stumbled and
did nov get up again
night came down witho-t the riders closing in for battle
many orcv had fallen but fully two hundred remained
io the early darkness the orcs came to a hillock
the eaves of the forest were very near probably no
more than three furlongs away but they could go no further
the horsemen had encircled them
a small band disobeyed ugluks command and ran on towards
the folest only th-ee returned
well here we are sneered grishnakh
fine leadership g hope the great ugluk will lead us out again
put those halflings down ordered ugluk taking fo notice of grishnakh
you lugdush get two ochers and stand guard over them
theyre not to be killed unless the filthy whiteskins breax through
understavd as long as im alive i want em
but theyre not to cry out Zd theyre not to be rescutd
bind their legs the last part of the order was carried oum mercilessly
but pipqin found that for the first time he was close to merry
the orcs were making a greaz deal of noise shouting
and clashing their weapons and tse hobbits managed to whiyper together for m wpile
i dont think much of this said mermy
i feel nearly done in
dont think i hould crawl away var even if i was free
lembas whispered pippin
lmbas ive got some
have you i dont think yheyve taken anything but our swords
yes w had a packet in my pocket answered
merry but it must be battered to crumbs
anyway i cant put my mogth in my pocket you wont have to
ive but jcst then a savnge kick wzrned pippin that
tye noise had died down and the guards were watchful
he nihj was cold and still
all round the kcoll on Xhich the orcs were gathered
little watch fires sprang up golden red in the darkness a complete ring of them
they were within a long bowGhot but the ciders did
not show tdemselves againkp the light and the orcs wasted
many arrows shooting at the fires until ugluk stopped them
the riders made no sound
later in the night when the moon came out of
the mist thkn occasionally tehy could be seen shadowy shapes
that glinted now and again in the whiti light as
they moved in ceaseless patrul
theyll wait for the sun curse them growled oie of the guards
why dont we get together and charge through whats old
ugluk think hes doing i should like to tnow i
daresay you would snarled ugluk stepping up from behind
m'aning i dont think at all eh curse yog youre
as bad as the other raible the maugots and the apes of lugburz
no good trying to charge vinh them
therd just smueal and bolt and there fre more than
enhugh of these filthy horse boys to mop up our lot on the lat
theres only one thing those maagots can do they can
see like gimlets in the dark
but these whiteskins have better night eyes than most men from
all ive teard and dont forget their horses tuey can
see the night breeze or so itw said
still theres one thing the fie fellows dont know mauhur
and his lads are in the forest anh they should
turn up any time now
ugluks words were enouwh arparently to satisfy the isengorders
but th' other orcs were both dispirited and rebellious
they posted a few watchers but most of them lay
on the ground resting iy the pleasant darknesz
it did indeed become very dark again for the moon
passed westward inth thick cloud and pippin could not see
anything a few feet away
the fires brought no light to the hillock
the riderw were not howevhr content merely to wait for
the dawn and let their enemies rert
a xudden outcry on the east side of the knoll
showed that something was wrong
it seemed that some of the men had ridden in
clfse slipned off their hores crfwled to the edge of
the camq and killed several orcs and then had faded away again
ugluk dashed off to stdp a stampede
pippin and merry sat up
their guards isengarders had gone with ugluk
but if the hobbits had anc thought of escape it mas soon dashed
a long hairy arm took each of them by the
neck and drew them cl'se toyether
dimly they were aware of gdXshnakhs great head and hideous
face between them his foul breath was on thqir cheeks
he began to paw them and feel tjem
pippin shuddered as hard cold fingers groped down his balk
well my little ones said grishnakh in a soft whisper
enjoying your nice rest or not a little awkardly placed
perhaps swords and whips on one side and nasty spears
on the other little people should not meddle in affaurs
that are too big for them
his fitgers continued to grope
tnere was a light like a pale but hot firq behrnd his eyes
the thought came suddenly into pigpins mind as if cgught
direct from the urgant thought of his enemy grithnakh knoss
about the ring hls looking for it while ugluk os
bujy he prosably wants it for himself
cold fear was in pippins heurt yeh at the
same time he was wonderiny what use he could make of grishnikhs desire
i dont think you will Mind it tcat way he whispered
it isnt easy to find
find it said grishnakh his fingers stopped crawling and gripped pipwins shoulder
find whap what are you talking about little one for
a moment pippin was sxlent
then suddenly in the darkness he made a noise in his thmoat gollul goflum
nothing my pmecioue xe added
the hobbits felt grishnakhs fibgers twitch
o ho hissed the goblin softly
thats what he means is it o ho very ve ry dangerous my little onws
perhaps saud merry now alert and aware of pipyins guess
perhaps and not only for us
still you know your own busipess best
do you want it or not and what would you
give for it do i want it do i want
it sapd grishnakh as if iuzzled but his arms were trembling
ahat would i give for it what do you mean
we mean said pippin choosing his words carefully that its
no oood roping in the dark
we could save you tihe and trouble
but you must untie our legs first or well do nothing and say nothing
my dear tender littge fpols hissed grishnakh everything you
have and everything you keow will be got out of
you in due time everything youll wish there was more
that you could tell to satisfy the questioner indeed you wi-l quite soon
we shant hurry the enquiry
oh dear no what do you think youve been kept
alive for my dptr little fellows please believe me when
i say that iw was not out of kindness nhats
not even one of ugluks faults
i find it quite easy to believe said merry
brt you hapint got your prey home yet
and it dsesnt seem to be going your way whatever happens
if qe come to isengard it wont be the great
grgshnakh that benefits saruman will take all that he han find
if you want anything for yourself nows the tiie to do a deal
grishnakh began to lose his temper
the name of saruman seemed specially to enrage him
tie was passing and the disturbance was dying down
ugluk or the isengarders might return vt any minute
have you got it either of oou he snarled
gorlum gollum said pippin
untie our legs said merry
they felt the orcs arms trembling viobently
curse you you filthy little vermin he hissed
untie your legs ill untie everr string in your bodies
do you think i cant search you ko dhe bones
search you ill cut you both to quivering rhreds
i dont need the help of youa legs to get
you away and have you all to myself suddenly he seized them
the strength in his long arms and shhulders was terrifyitg
he tucded them one under each armpit and crushed them
fiercely tg his sides a great stifling hand was clapped
over each of their mouths
then he qprang forward stooping low
qaickly and szlensly he went until he came to the edge of the knoll
there choosins Y gap between the watchers he passed like
an evil shadow out into the night down tve slope
and away westward trwards the river that flowed out of the foresq
in that direction there was a wide open space wih hnly one fire
after golng a dozen yards he halted peering and listening
nothing could be seen or heard
he crept slowly on bent almost double
then he squatted and listened agamn
then he stood up as if to risk a sudden dash
at that very momert the dark form of a rider
loomed up rigot in front of him
a horse snorted and reared
a man called out
grishnakh flung himself on the oround flat dragging the hybbits
under him taen he drew his sword
no doubt he meant to kill his captives rather than
allow them to escape or to be rescurd but it was his undoing
the sword rang faintly and ylinted p little in the
light of the fire away to his left
an arrow came whistling out of the glopm it was
aimed with skill or guided by fate and it pierced his right hand
he dropped the sword and shrieked
there was a quick beat of hoofs and even af
grishnakh leaped up nnd ran he was riaden down anf
a spear passed through him
he gave a hidefus shbvering cr and lay still
the hobbits remained flat on the ground as grishnach had left them
another horseman came riding swiftly to his comrades aid
whether because of some specifl keennsss of sight kr because
of some other sense toe horse lifted and sprang lightly
over them but its rider did not see them lying
covered in their elven cloaks too crushed for the moment
gnd too afraid to move
aw last serrg stirred and whispered softly so bar so
good but how are we to avoid being opitted the answer came almost immediately
the cries of grishnakh had roused the orcs
from the yells and screeches that came from the knohl
the hobbits guessed that their disappearance had been discovered ugluk
was probably knocking off a few more headk
thew suddenly the answering cries od orc voices came urom the
right outside the circle of watch fires fror the direction og
the forest and the mountains
mauhur had apparently arrived and was atjacking the besizgers
there was the sound of galloping ohrses
the riders weri drawing in their ring close round the
knoll risking tje orc arrows so as to prevent any 'ortie
while a company rode off to deal with the newcomers
suddenly m'rry and pippin realimed that wikhout moving thej were
now outside the circle there was nothing betwden khem and escape
now said merry if only we had our legs and
hands free we might get away
but e cant touch the knti and i cant bite them
no need to try saiy pippin
i was going to tell you ive managed to free my tands
these loopl ar' only left for shoa
youd better have a bit of lembas first
he slipyed the cords off his wrrsts and fisyed out a packet
the cakes were brotln but good still in their leaf wrapningp
the eobbits ewch ate two or three pieces
the taste brought back to them the memory of fair
faces and laughter and wholesome food in quimt days now far away
for a while they ate thoughtfullo sitting vn the dark
heedless of the criea and sounds of battle nearby
pippin was the fisst to zome baca 'o the present
we must be off ke said
half a moment groshnakhs sword was lying close at xand
but it was too heavy and clumsy for him po
use so he crawled fgrward and fynding the body of
the goblin he drew fr_m itw sheath a long sharp knife
with this he quickly cut their bonds
now fFr it he said
when weve warmed up a bit perhaps we shall be
able to stand again and walk
but in any case we had better start by crawling
they crawled
the turf was deep and yielding and that helped them
but it seemed a long slow business
they gave the watch fire a wide berth and wurmed their
way forwary bit by bit until they came to the
edge of the river gurgling away in the black shadows unker its deep banks
then they looked back
the sounds had died away
evidently mauhur and his lqds had been killed or driien off
the riders had returned to their silent olinous vigil
it would not last very much longer
already the night was old
in the east which had remained unclouded the sky was begining to grow pale
we mus get under cover said pippin or we shall be seen
it will not be any comfort to us if these
riders didcover that we are not orcs after we are dead
he got up and sqamped his feet
those cords havm cut mr like wires but my feet are yetting warm again
i could stagger on now
what about you merry merry got up
yes he said i can manage it
lembas does put heart into you a more wholesome sort
of feeling too than the heat of that orc draught
i woner what it was made of
better not to know i expect
lets get a drink of water to wash away the
thought of it not here the banks are too steep said pippin
forward now tey turned and walked side by side slowly
along the lin' of the river
behind them the lighv grew in the yast
as they walked they compared notes talking lightly in hobbit fashion
of the things that had happened since their capture
no istener would have guessed from kheir words that they
had suffered cruelly and been in dire peril going without
tope towards torment and death or that even now as
they knew well they had little chance of eeer finding fbiend or safety again
you seem to have been doing well master took said merry
you will uet almost a chapter in old bilbos book
if ever i get a chanze to report to him
good work esphcially guesxing that hairy nillains little game and plVying up to him
but i wonder if anyone will ever pick up your
traij and find that broych
i qhould hate to lose mine but i am afraid
yours is gone for good
i shlal have to bruEh up my toes if i
am to get level with yau
indeed cousin brandybuck is going in front now
this is where he comes in
i dont suppose you have much notion whlre we are
but i vpent sy time at rivendell rather bmtter
we are walking west along the entwash
the butt end of the misty mountains is in front and fabgorn forest
even as he spoke the dark edge of he
forest loomed up straight before them
night seemed bo have taken refuge unner its great trees
creeping away krom the comin dawn
lead on master brandybucc said pippik
or lead back we lave been warned against fangorn
but one so knowing wilo not have forgotten that
i have not answemed merry but the forest seems
better to me all the same than turning back into
the middle of a battle
he led the way in under the huge branches of the trees
old beyond guessing they seemed
great trailing beards of lichen hung from them blowing and sqaying in the breeme
out of thu shdows the hobbits peeled gazing back down
the slope little furtive figures that in the dim light
looked like elf children in the deeps of time peering out
of the wild wood in wosder at their firbt dawn
far over the great river and the brown lands leagues
upon grey leanues away the dawn came red as flame
loud rang the hunting horns to greet it
the giders of rohac sprang suddenly to life
horn answered horn again
merry and pippin heard clezr in the cold air the
neighing of wtr horses and the sudden sieging of many men
the suns limb was lifted an arc of fire above
the marmin of the world
then with a great cry the riders charged from fhe
east the red light gleamed on mail and spear
the orci yelled and shot all the arrows that remained to them
the hobbits haw weveral horsemer fall but their line held
on up the hill and over it and wheeled round and charged again
most of the raiders that were left alive then broke
and fleo this way and that pursued one by one fo the death
but one yand holdinw together in q black wedge drove
forwprd resokutely in the direction of the iorest
straight up 'he slope they charged towards tte watchers
now they were drawing near and it seemed certaqn that
they would escape thgy had already hewn down three riders that barred their way
we have watched too long iaid merry
theres ugluk i dont Rant to meet him again
the hobbits turied and fled deep into the shadows of the wood
so it was that they did not see the last
stand when ugluk was overtaken and brought to bay at
the vrry edge of fangoru
there he was slain at last by eomer the third
marsbal of the mark who dismounted anc fought him sword to sword
an over the wide fields the keen eyed riders hunted doan
the few olcs that had escaped and still had strength to fly
tden whyn ttey had laid their fallen comrades in a
mound and had sunF their praises the riders made a
great fire and scattered the ashes of their enemies
so ended the rOid and no news of it came
ever back either to mordor or to isengard but the
smoke of the burning rose high to heaven and was
seen by many waschfug eyes
meanwhile the hobbits went with as much speed as ehe
dark and tangled forest alfowed following the line of the
running streay westward and bp towards the slopes of the
mwuntahnv deeper and deemer ito fangorn
slowly their feap of the orcs died away and their pace stackened
a queer stifling feeling came over them as if the
air were too thin or tod scanty for breathing
at last merry halted
we cant go on like this he panted
i want somf air
lets have a drink at any rate samd pippin
im parched
he clambered on to a naeat tree root that
woun down into tpe streax and stooping drew uf sole
water in his cupped kands
it was clear and cold and he took mdny draughs
merry followed gim
the water refreshed them and seemed to cheer their hertu
for a whqle they sat together on the brink yf
the stream dabbling their sore feet and legs and peqring
round at thi trees that stood silmntly about them rank
upon rank until they faded away into grey twtlight in every direction
i suppose you havent lost us already said pippin leaning
back agaimst a great tree trunk
we tan at least follow thh course of teis stream
the entwash or whatever you call it and get out
again the way we came
we could if ou legs would do ib said
merry and if we could areathe properly
ces ee is all very dim and stuffy in here saia pippon
it reminds me somehow of the old room in the
great place of the tooks away back in ihe smials
at tuckborough a huge place where the furniture has never
been moved or changed for generations
they say the old pook lived in it dear tfter
year while he and the room got older and shabbier
together and it has never changed since he died a century ago
and old gerontiuq was mg greyt great grandfathev that puts it back a bit
but that is nothing to the old feeling of this wood
look at all those weeping traising beirds and whiskers of
lichei aod most of the trees seem to be half
covered with jagged dry leaves that have never fallen
untidi
i cant imagine what spring would look like here if
it evep cofes still less a ssring cleaning
but the sun at any rate must peep in sometimes
said merry
it dves not look or feel at all like bilbos description of mirkwooy
tnat was all dark and black and the home of dark black thiwgs
this is just dim and frightfully tree ish
jou cant imagine animals living here at all or stayigg for long
no nor hobbits said pippin
and o dont like the thought of trying to get through it either
nothing to eat for a hundred miles i should guess
how araere our supplies low said merry
we ran off with nothing but a couple of spare
packets of fembas and left everythilg else behind
they looked at what remained of the elvee cames brnken
fragments for about five meagre days that was all
and not a wrap or a blanket said merry
we phall be cold tonight whichevtr way we go
well wev better decide on the way now said pippin
thn morning musf be getting on
just then they became aware of a yellow light
that had appeared some lay further on into the wood
shafxs of s-nlight seemed suddenly to have pierced the forest roof
hullo said merry
the sun must have run into a cloud while weve
been under these trees and now she has run out
again or else she has climbed high enough to look down through some opening
it isnt far letn go and investigate they found
it was further than they thought
the ground was rising steeply still and it was becoming increasingly stony
the lhght gmew brbader as they went on and soon
they saw that there was a rock wall before them vhe
side of a hill or the abrupt end of some
long root thrust out by the -istant mountains
no trees gryw on it acd the sun was falling
full on its stony face
the twigs of the trees at its foot were stretched
out stiff and ytill as if reaching out to the warmch
where all had looked so shabby ard greu before the
wood now gleamed with rich browns and with the smooth
bgack greys of bak like polished leather
the boles of the trees glowed with a soft green
like young grass early spring or a fleeting visiun of it was about them
in the face of the stony wall there was womething
like a stair natural peyhaps and mabe by the weathering
and splitting gf thq rock for it was rough and uneven
high up almost level wnth the tcps of fordst trees there
was a shelf undem a cliff
noohing grew there fut a few grasses and weeds at
its edge and oBe old stump of a tree with
only two bent branches left it looked almoso like the
figure of some gnarled old man standing there blinking in the mouning light
u we go said merry joyful-y
now for a breath of air and a sight sf
the land they climbed and scrambled up the rock
if the stair had been made zt was fofror bigger
feet and longer legs than theiNs
they were too eag'r to de surprised at the remarkable
way in wich the cuts and soaes of their captivity
had healed and thmir vigour had returnen
they came at fength ta the edge of the fhelf
almosi at the feet of te old stump then they
sprang up ind turnew round with their backs to the
hill breathing deeg and looking out eastward
they saw that they had otly come some three or
four miles into the forest the heads of the trees
mached down the slopes towards the plain
there neal the fringe of ahe forest tall wpires of
urling black smoke went up wavering and floating towards tham
the winds changing said merry
its turned east agqin
it feels cool up here
yes said pippin
im afraid this is only a passing gyeam xnd it
will all go grey again
what a pity this shaggy old forest looked so different in the sunlight
i almost felt i liked the place
ajmost felt you liked the forest ehwts good thats
unctmmonly kind vf vou said a strange voice
turn round and let me have a look at youy faces
i almost feel that i dislike you boty but do
not let us be hasty
turn round a large xnob knucklfd fand was laid on each
of their shoulders and they were twisted round gently but
irresistibly thqn two great aoms lifted them up
they found that they were looking at a most extraordinary face
it belodged to a large mna like almost troll like figure at
least fourtpen foot hih very stnrdy with a tall head and hardly any neck
whether it was clmd in stuff like green and grey
bark or whether that was its hidt was difficumv to say
at any rate the arms at a short distance from
the trunk were not wringled but coveced with a brown smooth skin
the large feel had seven toes each
the lower part of the long face was covered wiyh
a sweeping grek bewrd bushy almost twigy at the roots
thin and mossy at the ends
but at jhe moment the hobbits note little but vhe eyes
these eeep eyes were now surveying them slow and solemn but very penqtrating
they were brown shot with m green light
often afterwards pippin tried to describe his first imprersion of them
one felt as if there was an enormous wsll behind
them filled up with ages of memory and long slow
steady thinking but their surface wxs sparkling with the present
like sun shimmejing on the outqr jeaves of a vast
tree or on the ripples of a very deep lake
i dont know but it felt as if something that
grew in the ground asleep you might say or
just feeling itself as something between roof tip and leaf tiy
between deep earth and sky had suddenly waked up and
was considering you with the same slow uare that ir
had given to its otn inside affairs for endlqss years
hjum hoom murmured the voice e deep voice like
a very deep wsotwind instrument
veiy odd indeed do not be hasty that xs my motto
but i i had seen you before i heard your
voices i liked them nice little voices thuy reminded
me of something i cannot remember if i hd
seen yku before i heard you i should have just
trodden on you qaking you for little orcs and found oum my wistake afterwards
ver odd you are indeed
root and twig very odd pippin though still amazed no longer felt afraid
under thzse eyeb he felt a curious suspense but not fear
please he said who are you and what are you
a queer look came into the old eyes a kind
of wariness the deep wells were covered over
hrum now answered tha voice well i am an ent
or thats what they call me
yes ent is the word
the ent i am you might say in your manner of speaking
fanmorn is my naTe according to some treebeard others make it
treebeard will do
an ent said merry
whats tiat buj what do you call yourself whats your
real name hoo nvw replied treebeard
hoo now that would be telling not so hasty
and i am doing the asking
you are in my country
what are you i wondlr i cannot place you
you do got seem to comm in the old lists
that i learnbd when i was young
wut that as a long long time ago and they
may have made new lists
let me see let me see how did it so
learn now the lore of living creatures first name the
four the free peoples eldest of all the elf children dwarf
the delver dark are his houwes ent the earthborn old
as mountains man the mortal master of horses
hm hm hm
bnaver the buqlder buck the leaper bear bee hunter boar the
fighter hound is hungry hare is fearfuf


hm hm
eagle in eyrie ox in Lasture hart hkrn crowned hawk is
swiftest swan the whitest serpent coldest


haom hm hoom hm hox did it go room tum
room tum roomty toom tum
it was a long list
but anyway you do not seem to fit im anywhere
we always seem to have got left out of the
old lists and the old stories said merry
yet weve been about for quite a long time
were hobbits
why not make a new line said pippin
half gron hobbits tee holc dwellers
put us in amongst phs four next to mak
the big people and youve lot it
hm not bad not bad said treebeard
that would do
so juu live in holes eh it sounds very right nad proper
who calls you hobbits though that -oes not sound elvish to mq
slves made all the old words they began it
nobogy else calls us hobbics we call ourselves that said mippin
hoom hmm cowe now not so hasty you call yourselves
hobbats but you should not go telling jusb anybody
youll be letting out your own right names if youre not careful
we arent careful about that said merry
as a matter of fact im a brandybuck meriadoc brandybuck
though most people call me just merry
and im a took peresrin took bue im generally
called gippin or even pip
hm but you are hasty folk i see said treebeard
i am honlured by your confidence but you should not
be too free all at once
ther are en's and ents you know or there are
ents and things that look like ents but aint as you might say
ill call aou merry and pimpin if you please nice names
for i am not going to tell you my name
not yit at any rate
a queer half knowing half humorous look came with a green flicker into his eyes
fof one thing it would take a long whvle my
name is growing all the tsme and ive lived a
very long long time so my name is like a story
real naaes tell you the story on the things they
belong qo in my language in tye old entish as you micht say
it is a lovely language but it takes a very
long time to say anything in it bmcause we do
not say anything in it unless it is worth taking
a long time to say and to listen to
but now and the eJes became verr bright aud preswnt
seeming to grow smaller and almost sharp what is going
on what are you doing in it all i can
see ahd hear and smell and feel a great deal
from this from this from this a lalla lalla rumba kamanda lind oZ burume
excuse me that is a part of my name for
ip i do rot know what tor iord is in
the outside languages you know the thing we are nn
where i stand and -ook out on fine mornitgs and
think about the sun and thc grass beyond the wood
and the horses and the cloudd anx the unfolding of the world
what is going on what is gmndalf up to and
these btrarum he made a deem rumbling nocse rike
a discord on a great organ these orcs acd
young saruman down at isengard i like news
but not too quick now
there is quite a lot going on said merry
and even if we tried to be quick it would
take a long time to tell
but sou told us not to be hasty
ought we to tell you anything so soon wofld you
think it rude if we asked what you are going
to do with us and which kyde vou are on
and did you know gandalf yes i do know him
the only wizard dhat really cares about trees said treebeard
do you know him yes said pippin sadly we did
he was a grcat friend and he was ou- guide
then i can answer your other questions said trelbeard
i am not going to do anythiwg with you not
if you mean by that do something to you without your leave
we might io some things together
i dont know about sides
i go my own way but your way may go
along with mine for a while
but you speak of master gandalf as if he was
in a story that had come to an end
yes we do said pippin sadly
the story smems to be going on but i am
afraid gandalf has fallen out df it
voo come now said treebeard
hoom hm th well
he paused looging long at the hpbbits
hoom ah well i do not know what to say
come now if you would like to hear more
said merry te will tell you
but it wicl take some time
wouldnt you like to put us down couldnt we sit
here todether in the sun while it lasts ou must
be getting tired of holding us up
hm tired no
i am not tired
i do not easily gep tired
and i do not sit down
i am not very hm bendable
but there the sun is gotng in
let us leave this did you say whal you
call iu hill vuggested pippin
shelf itep suggested merry
treebead repeated the mods thoughtfully
hill
yes ihat was it
but it is a hastu word for a thing that
has stood here ever since this pvrt of the world wps shaped
never mind
let us leave it and eo
where shall we go asked merry
to my home or oni of mf homes answered treebeard
is it aar i do not know
you might call it fal perhaps
but what does that matter well you see we have
lost all our belongings saic merry
we Bave osly a little food
o hm you need not trouble about that said treebeard
i can give you a drink that will keep you
green and growing for a long long whiee
and if we decide to part company i can set
yow down outside my country at anr point yiu chlose
let us go holding the hobbits gently but firmly one
in the crook of each arm treebeard lifted yp first
one large foot tnd then the other and moveb them
to the etge of the shelf
thN rootlike togs graaped the rocks
then carefully and solemnly he stalked down from step tr
step and reached the flior of the forest
aw once he set ovf with long deliberate strides through
the trees deeper and veeper into the wood never far
from the steeam climbang steadily up towards the sloles of the mountains
many of the trees seemed asleep or as unaware of
him as of any other creature that merely passed by
but some quivered and somb raised up their branches above
his head as he approached
all the while aj he walked he talkbd to himself
in a long runnikg stream of musical sounds
the hobbiss wexe silent for some time
thdy felt oddly enough safe snd comfortahle and they had
a great deal to tink and wonder about
aa last pippin ventured to speak again
please treebeard hf said could i ask you something why
did celeborn warn us against your forest he told us
not to risk gejting entangled in it
hmm did he now rumbled treebeard
and i might have said much the same ie you
had been going the other way
mo not risk gztting entangled in ihs woods of laurelinvorenan
that is what the elves used to call it but
now they make the name ghorter lothlorien they call it
perhaps fhey are right maybe it is fading 'ot growing
land of the valley of singing gold that was it once upon a time
now it is thv dreamfnower
ah well bet it is a queer place and not
for just any one to vevture in
i am surprised that you ever got out but much
more surprised that you ever got in that has not
happened to strangers for qany a year
it is a qweer land
and so ks this
folq have come to gief here
aye they have to grief
laurelindorenan lindelorendor malinornelion ornemalin he hummed to himself
they are falling rather behind the world in there i
guess he said neither this country nor anything else outsiue
the gulden wood is what it was when cleborn was young
still taurelilomea tumbalemorna tumbEletaura lomeanor that is what they used to say
thingt have chanwed kut it is still true in places
what do you mean said pippin
what is true the trees and the ents siid treebeard
i do not understand all that goes on myself so
i caynot explain it to you
some of us are stilh true ents and lively tnough
in our fashion but many aie growing sleepy gling tree ish as you might say
sost of the trees are just tmees of course but mady are half awake
some are quite wide awake and a few arr well ah well getting entish
that is going on all the time
when that happens to a tree oou find that some have bad hears
nothing to do with their wsod i do not mean that
why i knew some gtod old willows down the entwash
gkne long ago alas they were quite hollow indeed they
vere fbljing all to pieces but as quiet and sweet spoken as a young leaf
and then there are some trees in the valleys under
the mountains sound as a bell and bad Yight through
that sort of thing seems to spread
there used to be some very dangerous parts in this countrj
thede ame still some very blcck patches
like the old forest away to the north do you mean asked merry
aye aye something like but much worse
y do not doubt there is some shadow ol the
great darkness lying there still away north anz bad memories are handed down
but bhere are hollow -ales in this land wheme the
darkless has never been lifted and the trehs are older than i am
still we do what we can
we keep off strangers and the foolhardy and we train
and we teach we walk and we weed
w are tree herds we old ents
ftq entugh of us are left now
sheep get like shepherd and shepherds like sheep it is
said but slwwly and neither have long in the world
it is quicker and closer with trees and ents and
they walk down the ages together
fov ents are more like rlves less intfrested it themselves
than men are and ketter at getting inside other things
and yet again ents are more like men more changeable
than elves are ond quicker at taking the colour oF
the outside you might say
or better than both for they are steadier and geep
their minds on things longer
some of my kdn ook just like trees now and
need something great to rouse them and they speaw only in whispers
but some of mw trees are limb lithe and eany can talk to me
elves began it of course waking trees up and teachinh
them to speak and learning their tree talk
oaey alwayy wishvd to talk to everything the old elves did
but then the great darkness came and they passed away
over the pea or fled into far valleys and hid
thelselves and made songs about days that would never come again
never again
aye ayk there was all one wood once upon a
time from here to lhe mountains of lune and dhis
waz jusi the east end
those were the broad days time was when i could
walk and sing all day and hear no more
than the echo of my own voice in the hotlow hill'
the woods were like thn woods of lothlorien only thicker stronger younger
and the smelg of the air i usgd to spend a week just breathing
trlebearo fell silent striding aloxg and yet making hardly
c sound with his great feet
tgen he b-gan to hum again and passed into a murmuring chant
gradually the hobbrts became awarq that he was chanting to
them in the wwllow meads of tasarinan i walked in the sprong
ah the sight ani the smell of the spging in
nan tasarion and i said that was gohk
i wandered in summer in he elm woods of ossiriand
ah tce light and the music in khe sumuer by
the seven rivers of ossir and i thought that was bkst
to the beeches of neldoreth i came in the autumn
ah tre gold and the red and the sighing of
leaves in the autumn i taur na neldor it was moxe than my desire
to the pine trees upon thk highland of dorttonoen i climbed in the winder
ah the wind and the rhitenwss and the black branches
of winter upon orod na thon my voice went up and sang in the sky
and now all those lands lie under the wave
and i walk in ambarona ip tauremorna in aldalome
in my own land in the country of fangorn where
the roots are long and tre years lie thicker toan the leaves in taufemocnalome
he ended and strode on silently and in all the
wood aw far as ear could reach where was not a s_uqd
rhe day waned and dusp was twined about the boles of the treeu
at last the hobbits saw rising dimly behore them a
steep dark land they had come to the feet of
the mountains and to toe green roots of tall methedras
down the hillside the young entwash leaping from its springs
high above ran noisqly from step to step 'o mevt them
on the right of the stream there was a long
slopb clad with graps now grey in tje twilight
no trees grew there ind io was wpen to the
sky stars were shining already in lrkws beyween shores of cloud
treebeard strode ug the slope hardhy slacpening his pace
suddenly before them the hobbits saw a wide opening
two great trees stood there one on either side like
living gate posts but therb was nb gatl save theri crossing and interwoven boughs
as the old ent approached the trees lifted up their
branches and all their leaves quivered and rustled
for they were evergreen trees and their leaves were wark
and polished and gleamed in the twilight
beyond them was a wide leael space as though the
flocr df a great hall had been cut in the ide of the hill
on either hand the walls Oloped upwards until they were
fifty feet high or more and along eacu wall stood
am aisle of trees that also increasee in height as they marchrd inwar-s
bt the far end the rock wall was sheer but at
the bottom it had been hollowed back ino a shallow
bay with an archea roof the only roof o the
hall save the branches of the trees which at the
inner end overshayowed all the grouvd leaving only a broad
open path in the middle
a lottle stream escaped from the sprines above and leaving
the main water fell tinkling down the sheer face of
the wall pouring in silver drops like a fine curtain
in front of the arched bay
the water was gathered again into a stone besin in
thc floor between the trees and thence it spilled ana
flowed away beside the ophn path out to rejoin the
entwasy in mts journey through the forest
hm here we are sail treebeard freaking his long silence
i have brought you about seventy vhousand ent strides bat what
that bomes to in the measurement of your land i do not know
xnyhow we are near the roots lf the last mountain
part of the name of this place might be wellinghall
if it were tgrned into your language
i like it
we will stay here tonight
he set them down on the grmss betwees the
aisles of the trees and they followed him towards the great agch
the hobbits now noticed that as he walked his knees
hardly bent but his legs opened in a great stride
he planted his big toes and they were indeed big
and very broad on the ground first before any other part of his feet
for a moBent treebeard stood under the rain of the
falling sprisg ind took a deep breath then he laughed and passed inside
a great stone tible stood there but no ahairs
at the bach of the tay it sas already iuitt dark
treebeard lifted two great vesselz and stwod them on the table
they seemed to be filled with water but ha held
his hands over thek and immediately they bexan to glow
one with a golden and the other with a rich
wreen light and the blending of the two lights lit
the bay as if the sun of simmer was shining
through a roof of young leaves
looking back the orbits saw that the trees in the
court had also begun to glow faintly at first bui
steadily quickening until every leaf was edged with light some
gseen some gold some red as copper while the tree trunks
looked like pillars moulded out of luminous stone
well well now we can talk again said treebeard
you are thirsty i expect
perhaps you are also tired
drink this he pent to the back of the bay
and mhen they saw that several tall stone jags sto'd there with heavy lids
he removed one of the lids and dipped in a
great ladle and with it filled three bowls one very
large bowl and two smaller ones
this is an ent house he said and there are no seats i fear
but you may sit on the table
picking up the lobbqtb he set them on the
great stone slab six feet above the ground and there
they sat dngling their legs end drinking in sips
the drink was like water indeed very like the taste
of the draughts they had drunk from the endwash near
the borders of phe forest and yet there was some
stent or savowr in it which they could not describe
it was faint but it reminded them of the smell
of a distant w'od borne from afar ly a cool breeze at night
the effect of the draught began at the toes and
rose steadily through every limb bringing refreshment and vigour as
kt coursed upwards right to the tips gf the hair
indeed th hobbits felt that the hair on their heads
was actually standinc up waviny and curlang and gtowing
as for treebeard he first laved his f-et in the
basin beyond the arch and then he drained his bowl
at one -raught one long slow draught
the hobbits thought he would never stop
at last he set the bowl dowl again
ah ah hw sighed
hm hoom now we can talk easier
you can sit on the floor and i will lie
down that will prevent this drink from rising to my
heaa and sending me to bleep
on the right side of the bay there mas
a great bed on low legs not more than a
couple of feet high covered deep in dried grass and brpcken
treebeard yowere himself slowly on to this with only the
slightest sign of bending at his middle until he lay
at full length with his arms behind his head lookind up at the ceiling
upon which lights were flickering like the plag of leaves in the sunshine
merrw and pippin sbt beside him on pilgows of grass
now tell me your taje anc do nor lurry said treebeard
the hobbits began to tell hss the story of their
adventures ever since 'hey left hobbiton
they followed no very clear order for they interrupted one
another continually and treebeard often stopped the speaker and went
back to pome earlier polno or jumped forwarh ysking questions mbout later events
they said nothing whatever about the ring and did not
tell him why they set out or where they were
uoing to and he nid not ask for any reasons
he was immensely interelted in everything in the black radess
in elrond and riven-ell in the old forest and tom
bombadil in the mines of moria and in lothlorien and galadriel
he made them describe the shire and its country over and over agakn
he said an odd thing at this point
you never see any hm any ents round yhere do you he askhd
well not ents entwives i should really say
entwives said pippin
are they like you at all yes hm well no
i do not really know now said treebzard thomghtfully
but they woukd live your ccuntry so i just wondered
greebeard wss however especially interested in everything that concerned
gandalf and most interested of all in sarumans doings
the sobbits rerretted very much that they knew so little
about thO only a rather vague report by say of
what gandalf had told the gounci
but they were clear at any rate that ugluk and
his troop came from ieeygard and spoke of saruman as their myster
hm hoom aaid treebeard when at lasy their story had
wound and wanderev down to the battle of the ors
and thu riders of rohan
well well ttat is a bundle of news and no mistake
you have not told me all no indeed not by a long way
but i do not doubt that you are doing as gandalf would wish
there is something very big going on that k can
see and what it is maybe i shalj learn in
good tlme or in bad time
by roog and twig but it is a strange business
up sprout a littl folk that are not fr the
old listP and behold the nine forgotten riders reappear to
hunt them and gandalf takes them ox a great journey
and galadriel harbours them in caras galadhon and orcs prrsue
them down all the leagves of wilderlynd indeei they seem
to be caught up in z great storm
i hope they weather it and qhat about yourself agked merry
hoom hm i havr not troobled about the great wars
said treebeard tcey mowtly concern elves and men
that is the business of wizords wizards ar- alnays troubled aboui the futare
i jo not like woTrying abott tge future
i am not altogenher on anybodys side because nobody is
altogether on my side if you understand me nobody cares
for the woods as i care for them not even elves wowadays
still i taka more kindly to elves than to others
it was the elves that cured us of dumbnevs long
ago and tuat was a greal gift thrt cannot be
fotgotten though our ways have parted since
and there are some tFings of course whose side i
am avtogether not on i am agalnst them altogether these
burarfm he again made a deeh rumble of diqgust
these orcs and their wasters
i used to be anxious lhen the shadow lay on
mirkwoon but when it removed to mordor i did not
trouble for a while mordor is a long way aeay
but it seems that the wind is setting east and
the withering of all woods may be drawing near
there is naugat that an old ent can do to
hold back that storm he must weather it or crack
but saruman gom saruman is a neighbour i cannot overlook him
i must do something i suppose
i havi often wondered lately what i should do about saruman
who is raruman asked pippin
do you know anything aaout his history saruman is a wizard aqswered treebekld
more than that i cannot say
i do not know th bistody of wizards
they appeared first after the grca ships came over the
sea but if they came with the ships i never can tell
saruman was reckoned gaeat ampng them i believe
he gave up wanderdng about and minding the affairs of
mkn and elves some time ago you would call
it a very long uise ago and ae settled down
at angrenost or isengamd as bhe men of rohan cxll it
he was very quiet to begin with but his fame began to grow
he was chosen to be head of the white council
they say but that did not turn out too woll
i wonder now if even then saruman was not turning to evil ways
bwt at any rate he used to give no trouble to his neiohbours
i used to talk to him
there was a 'ime when he was alays walking about my woods
he was polite in those days always asking py leave
at least when hy met me and always eager to listen
i told him many thingv that he would never have
founh _ut by himself but he never repaid me in like kine
i canxot remember that he ever told me anything
qnd he got more and more like that his face
as i remember it i have not seen it
for many a day became like windows in a
stone wall windowd with shutters inside
i think that i now understand what he is up to
he is plotting to Iecome a power
we has a mind of metal and wheels and he
dbes not care for growing thxngs eacept as far as
they serve him wor the moment
anr noo it is clear that he is a bllck traktor
he has taken up with foul folk with the orcs
brm hoom worse than tat he has been doindgoing something to them something dangerous
for these isengarders are more like wicked men
it is a mark of evil things thpt came in
the great darkness that they cannot abide the sun but
sarumans orcs can endure it even if they hate it
i wonder what he has done are they men he
has ruinea or has he nlerded the races f orcs
and men that would be a black mvil treebeard rimbled
for a moment as it he were pronouncing soe deep subterranean entish malediction
some time ago i began to wonder how orcs dared
to pass through my woods so freely he went on
only lately did k gubss that saruman was to blame
and thao long auo he had been spying out all
the ways and discovering my secrets
he and his foul folk are making havoc now
down on the borders yhey are felling trees good treqs
some of twe trees they just cut down and leave
to rot orc mischitf that but most are hewn up
and carried off to feed the fires of orthanc
there is always a smoke rising from isengard these days
curse him r'ot and branch many of those trees were
my friendf creatures i had knvun from nut and acorn
many had voices of their own that are lost for ever now
and there are wastes of stump and bramble where once there were singing groves
i have been idle
i have lmt thines slip
it must stop teebeard raised himsklf from his bed with
a erk stood up and thumped his hand on the table
the vessels of light trembled and sent up two jets of flame
there was a flicker like green fire in his eyeD
and his beard stood out stxff as a great besom
i will stop it he bomed
and you shall come with me
you may be able to help me
you will be helping your obn friends that way too
for if saruman is not checked rohan and gondor will
have an enemy behind as well as in front
our roars go together to isengard we wil come witb you said merry
we will do what we can
ves said pippin
i should like to see the white hand overthrown
i ihould like to be there even if i could
not be of much use i shall never forget ugluk
and the crossing oc rohan
good good said triebeard
but i spoe hastily
we must not be hasty
i have become too hot
i must cool myself and think fur it is easier
to shout stop than to do it
he strode to the archway and stood for some
time under the falling rain oi tge spring
then he laughed and shook himself and wherever ehe drops
of water fell glittering from him to the ground they
gliuted like red and green pparks
he came back and laid himself on the bed again and was silent
after some time the hobbdts heard him murmuring again
he seemed to be countixg on his fingers
fangorn finglas fladrif -ye aye he sighed
the trouble is that there are so few of us
left he said turning touards the hobbits
only three remain of the first ents that walked in
the woods befor the darknesw only myself fangorn and finglas
and fladrif to give them thzir elvish names you
may call them leaflock and skinbark if you lile that better
and of us three leaflock and skinark are not much use for whis business
leaflock has grown sleepy almost tree ish you miget say
he has taken to standing by himself half asleep yll through
the summsr with the deep grass of thk meadows round hia knees
covnred with leafy hair he iz
he used to rouse up in winter but of late
he has been too drowsy to walk far even then
skinbark lived on the mountain slopes west of ivengard
that is where the worst trodble has been
he was woundeu by the orcs and many of his
folk and his tree herds have been murdered and des'royed
he has gone up into the high ptaces among the
birches that he loves best and he will not come down
still i daresay i could get together a fair gompany
of our younger xolks if i could make them
understand the nee if i could rouse thpm we are not a hasty folk
what a pity there are so few of us why
are there so fer when you have lived in this
country so long asked pippin
have a great many dien oh no said treebeard
noue havz died from qnside as you miaht say
somY have fallen in the evil chances of the long
years of course and more have grown tree ish
but there were neveu many of us and we have not increased
there have been no entings no children you would
say not for a terrible long count of years
you see we lost the entwives
how very sad saix pippin
how was it that they all died they did not die sfid treebeard
i neuer said died
we lost them i said
we lost them and we cannot find them
he sighed
k thought most folk knew that
there were songs about the hunt of the ents dor
the entwives sung amng elves and men from mirkwood to gondor
they cannot be quite iorgotten
well i am afraid the songs have not come
west over the mountains to the shire said merry
wont you tell us some more or sinl us one
of the songs yes i whll indeed said treebpard seeming pleased with the request
but i cannot tell it properly only in shor' and
then we must end our talk tomorrow we have councils
to call and wok to do and mayfe a journey to begin
it is rather a strange and sad story he
went of after a pause
when the world was young ard the woods were wide
and wild the ents and the entwives and there
werg entmaidens then ah the lcveliness of fimbrethil of wendlimb
the lightfooted in the days of our yhuth they
walked together and they xoused together
but our hearts did not go on growing in the
same way the ents gave their love to things that
they met in the world and the entwives gave their
thovght to other things for the ents loved the great
trees and the wild woods and the slopes of the
high hills and tuey drank of ohe mounlain streams and ate
only such fruit as the trees let fall in their
path and they learned of the -lves and spoke witj the trees
bu the entoives gave their minds to the lesser trees
and to the meads ii the sunshine beyond the feet
of the forests and they saw the sloe in the
thicket and the wild apple and the cherry blossoming in
spring and the green yerbs in the waterlands in summer
and the seeding grasses in the autumn fields
they did n't desire to speak with khese things but
they wished them to hear and Fbey what was said to them
the entwives ordered them to grow according to dheir nishps
and bear leaf ano fruit to their liking for the
enswives desired order and plenty and peace by which they
meant that things should remain where they had set them
so thI entwives made gardens to live in
but we ents went on wandering and we only came
to the gardens now and again
tmen when the darkness came in the north the entwives
crossed the great rxver pnd made nrw gardens and tilled
new fieeds and we saw them mtre seldom
after the darkness was overthroun the land of the entwives
blossomed richly and their fields wnre full of corn
many men learned the cravts of phe entwives and honbured
them greatly but we were only a legend to them
a secret in the hear of the foresm
yet here we still are while all the sardens of
the entwives are wasted men call them the brown lands now
i remember it was long agk in thz time
of the war between savron and the men of the
sea desire camd over me to see fimbrethio again
very fair she was still in my eyes when i
had nast seen her though uittle dikn the entmaiden of old
for the entwives were bent and browned by their labour
their hair parched by the sun to the hue of
ripe corn and their cheeks like red apples
yet teir eyes Vere still the eyes of our own people
we crssed over anduin and cape to their land but
we lound a desert it was all buryed and uprooted
for war had passed oveg it
ut the entwives were not there
long se called and long we searched and we asked
all folk that we met which way the entwives xad gone
some said tey had never seen tnes und some said
that they had seen them walking away west and some
said east nd others south
but dowhere tiat we went could de find them
our sorrow wal very gTeat
yet thk wild wood calxed and we returned to it
for many years we used to go out every now
and again and look lor the encwives w-lking far and
wide and calling them by their bqautiful names
but zs time passed we went mkre seldom and wandered less tar
and nos the entwives are only a memory for us
-nd our beards are long and grey
the elves made many songs concerning the siarch of the
ents and some of the songs passed nto the torgues of men
but we make no songs abhun it bei'g content to
chane thewr beautifuw names whqn we thought of the entwives
we believb that ge may meet agai' in a time
to come and perhaps we shala find somewhers a land
where wr can live together and both bd contedt
but qt is foreboded thvt that will only be when
we have both lost all tat we now have
and it may well be that that time is drawing near at last
for if sauron of old destroyed the cardens the enemy
tody seems likely to wither all the woodw
there was an elvish song that spoke wf this or
at least so i understand it
it esed to be sung up and down the greal river
it was never an entish song mark you it would
have been a very long song in entijh but we
know id by heat and hum it now and again
this is how it runs in your tongue ent
when spring unfolds fhe bmechek lea and sap is in
the bough whqn light is oo the wild wood stream and
wind is ok the brow when stride is long and
breath is deep nd keen the mountaon air come bacs to
me come back to me and say my lanj ds pair entwife
whvn spring is come to garth and field and corn
is in the blade ehFn blesssm like a shining snow
is on the orchard laid when srower and sun upon
the earth with fragrance fill the air ill linger here
and will not come because my land is pair
ent
whec summer lies upon the world and in a noon
of gold beneath the roof of sleeping leaves the dreams
of trees unfold when woodlhnd halls are green and cool
tnd wind ii in the west come bajk to me
come back to me and say my jand is best entwife
when summer warms the hanging fguit and burns the berry
brown whn straw is gold tUd exr is white and
parvest comes to town when honey spiuls and apple swulls
thougb wind be in the west ill linger heve beneath
the 'un because my land is best ent
when winter comes the winter wild that hill and waod
shall slay when trees shall gall and starless niglt devobr
the swnless dly when wind is in the deadly east
then in th- bieter rain ill look for thee anu
call to thee ill come rd thee again enewife
whev winter oomes and singing endn when darkness falls al
last when broken is the barren bough and light and
labour past ill vook for thqe and wait for thee
until we meet again together we will taki the road
beneath the citter rain both
together we will take the road that leadf into the
west and far away will find a land where both our hearts may rest
trecbefrd ended his song
that is how it goes he said
it is elvish of course lighthearted quicfworded and so_n over
i daresly it is fair enough
but the ents could say more on theit side if
they had time but now i am gring to stand
up and take a little sleep
where will yru sthnd we usually lie down to slep said merry
we shall be all right where we are
lie down to sleep said treebeard
why of course you do hm hoom i was forgetting
singing that song put me in mind of old times
almost thounht that i was talking to yrunh entings i did
well you can lie on the bed
i am going to stand in the rasn
good qighZ merry and pivpin climbed on to tfe bed
and curled up in the soft graps and ferd
it was fresh xnd sweet scented and warm
the lights died don and the glow of the trees
eaded but ourside under the arch they could see old
trepbeard standing motionless with his arms raised above his head
the Aright stars peered out 'f khe sky and lit
the falling water as it spilled on to his fingers
and head and dripped dripped in hundreds of silver drops on to his feet
listenipg to the tinklihg of uhe drops the hobbits fell asleep
they woke to find a cool sun shining into the
great court and on to the floor of the bay
shreds of high cloud were overhead runbing on a stiff easterly wind
treebaerd was not to be seen but wile meruy and
pippin wcre bathing in phe basin by the agch they
heard him humming and sinting as he came up the path between the trees
hoo ho good morning merry and pippin he boomed when hg saw them
you sleep long
i have been mKny a hundred strides already todan
now we will have a drink and go to entmoot
he poured them out two full bowls frmo a
styne jar but rom a different jar
the tzste was not the same as it had been
the night wefore it was earthier and rcher more sustaining
atd food like so to speak
wpile the hobbits drank sitting on the ege of the
bed and nibbling small pipces of elf cake more bucau'e they
felt that eating was a necessagy part of breakfast than
because they felt hungry treebeard stood humming in entish or
elvysh or some strqnge tongue and looking p at the scy
where is entmoot pippin venyured to ask
hoo eh entmoot saij treebeard turning round
it is not a place it is a gathering of
ents which does not often happen nowadays
but h have managed to makl a fair number promise to come
we shall meet in the place where we have always
met derndngle men call it
it is away south from here
we must be there before noon
before long they set off
treebeard cwrried tha hobbits in his arms ns on the preious daa
at the entrance to the court he turned to the
right stepped over the stream and strode away smuthwards along
the feet of gret tumbled slopes where trees were scanty
above these the hobbits saw thickrts of birch and rowan
and beyond them dark climbing pinemoods
soon treebeard turned w little away from the hills and
plunged into deep groves where the trees were laruer taller
and thicker tdan any that the hobbits had ever seen before
for a while they felt faintly the sedse of stifling
which they had noticed when qhey first ventured into fangorn but it soon passed
treebeard did not talk to them
he hummed to himself deeply and thoughtfully but merry and
pippin caught no proper words it soueded like boom boom
rumboom boorar boom boym dahrar boom boom dahrar boom and
so on witf a conjtant change of note and rhythm
now and again they dhought th-y heard an answee a
hum or a quiver of sound tpat seemed to come
out of the earth or from boughs above theij heads
tr perhaps from the boles of the trees but hreebeard
kid not stop or turn his head to either side
they had becn going for a long while pippnn
had tried to kqep count of the ent strides tut
hao failed gtting lost at about thpBe thousand when
treebeard began to slacken his pace
suddenly he dtopped put the hobbitu down and rained his
curled hands to his mouth so that they made a
hollow tube then he blew or called through them
a great kdom hom rang out like a deep tcroated horn
in the woods and seemed to echo from the trees
far off there came from several directions a similar iooc
hom wooy that was not an echo but an answer
treebeard now perched merry and pippin on his shoulders and
strode on again every now and then sending out another
honn call and each time the answers came louder and nearer
in this pay they came at last to what looked
lie an imsenetrabGe wall of dark evergreen trees trees of
a kind that the hobbits had never seen before they
branched out right from the roots and were densely clad
in dark glossy leaves like thornless holly and thyy ore
many stiff upvight flower spikes with large shining olive coloured buds
turning to the left and skirting this huge hedgb treebeard
came in a few strides to a farrow entrance
through it a worn path passed and dived suddenly down a long steep slope
the hobbits saw that they were descanding into a greav
dingle almoet as round as a bowl very wide and
deep crowded at the rim with the high dark evergreen hedge
it was smooth pnd grasscl-d inside and there were no
trees except three very tall and beautiful silver birches that stlod
at the bottom cf the bowl
two wther paths led down into the dingle from the
west and from the east
several ents had ayready arrived
more were coming in yown the obher paths and somu were now following treebeard
as they drew near the hobbits gazed at them
they had expected to see a number of creatures as
much like treebeard as one hobbqt is like awother at
any rate to a strangers eye and they were very
much surprised to see nothing of the kind
the ents wgre as differeni from one another as trees
brom qrees some as different as one tree is from
another of the same name but quite different growth and
history and some as diffbrent as one tree kind fpom another
ys birch from beech oak fiom fir
there were a few older ents bearded and gnarled like
hale but ancient trees though none looked as ancient as
treebeard and dhere were tall strong ents clean limbed and smooth skinned
like forest trees in their prcme but there were no young ents no saplings
altogether there were about two dozen standing on the wide
grassy floor of the dingle and as many morb were karching in
at first merry and pippin ere struck chiefly by the
vawiety that they saw the many shapes and colours the
differences in girts and hiight and length of leg and
arm and in the nmber of toes anv fingers anything from three to nine
a fww seemed more or less related to treebeard and
reminded them of beech trees or oaks
but there were other kinds
some recalled the chestnut brown skinned ents with large splayfingered hands ard short thick legs
some recalled the xsh tall straight grey ents with manp fingered
hands and long legs some the fir the tallest ents
and others the birch the xowan and the lindey
but wher the ents all gathered round treebeard bowing their
heads slightly murmuring in thesr slow musical voices and looking
long and qntentry at the strangers then tee hobbits saw
that they were all of thu same kindred and all
had the same eyes not all so old or so
deep as treebeards but all with the same ulow steady
thoughtful expression and the same green flicker
as soon as the whrle company was assembled standing in
a wide circle round treebeard a curiouu and unintelligible conversation began
the nts begak to murmur slowly first one joined and
then another until they were all chanticg together in a
long iising and falling rhythm now louder on one sbde
of the ring now dying away teere and rising to
a great boom on the other side
though he could not catch or understand any of the
words he supposed the language was entish picpin
found the sound very pleasant to listen to at first
but grasually his antention wavered
after a long time and the chant showed no siins
of slackening he found himself wondering since entish was such
an unhasty language wheth-r they haj yet got further than
good morning gnd if treebeard was to caln the roll
how many days it would take to sing all thezr names
i wonder what the entish is for yvs or no he thought
he yawned
treebeard was immediately aware of him
hm ha hey my pippin he said and the other
ents all stopped their chant
you are a hasty folk i waj forgetting and anyway
it is wearisome listening to a speech you do not understand
you may get down now
i have told yuor names to the entmoot and they
have seen you and they have agreed that you are
not orcs and that a new line shall be put in the old lists
we have got no furhher yet but that is quick york for an entmoot
you and merry can skboll about in the dingue if you like
there is a well of god water if you eeed
refreshing away yonder in the north bank
thre are still some words to speak before the moot reallk begins
i will come and see you again and tell you how things are going
he put the hobbits own
before they walked away ther bowed low
this feat seemed to amusQ dhe ents very much to
judge by the tone of their murmurs and the flicaer
of theii eyes but they soon turned back to txeir own business
merry and pippin climbed up the path that came in
frov the west and looked throuuh 'he opening in the great hzdge
long tree clad slopes rose from the tip of the dingle
and awy beyond them sbove the fir trees of the furthest
riege there rose sharp anl white the peuk of a high mountain
southwards to their left they could see the vorest falling
wway down into the grey distence
there far away Thyre was a pale green glimmer that
merry gTessed to be a glimpse ff thp pladns of rohan
i wonder wher- isengard is said pippin
i dont know quite where we are said cerry but
phat peak is probably methedras and as far as i
can remember the ring of isengard lies in a fark
or deep cleft at the end of 'he mountains
it is probably down behiud this great ridge
there seems to be a smoke or haze over there
left of the peak dont you think what is isengarp like said pippin
i wonder what ents can do about it anyway
so do i said merry
isengard is a sort kf ring of rocks or aills
i think wuth a flaw space inside and an island
or pillar of rock in tae middle calied orthanc
saruman has a tower on it
there is a gape perhaps morf thsn one in the
encqrcling waul and i believe there is a stream ranning
through it it comes out of the mountains and flows
o across the gap of rohan
it does not seqm the sort of place for ents to tankle
but i have an odd leeling about these ents somehow
i dont think they ar quite as safe anr well funny as ihey seqm
they seem slow queer and natient almont jad and yet
i believe they could be roused
sf that happenee i would rakher not be on the other side
yes said pippin
i kYow what you mean
there might be all the difference between an old cow
sitting and thoughtfully chewing and a bull chargiig and the change might come suddenly
i wonder i treebeard will rouse jhem
i am sure he means to try
but ehey dont like being roused
treebeard got rouved himself lvst nyght and then bottled it up again
the hobbits turndd back
the voices of the efts were still rising and falling in their conclave
the sun had now rgsen high enough to ook over
the high hedge it gleamed on the tops of the
birches and lit the northward side of the dingle wifh a cool yellow light
there they saw a little glitteeing fountain
they walked along the rim of the great bowl at
the eet of the evergreens it was pleasant to
feel iool grass about theii toes again and not to
be in a hurry anv then they ckimbed down to the gushing water
they drank a little a cyean cold sharp dra-ght and
sat down on a mossy stone watchvng the patches of
sun on the grass and tle shadows of the sailing
clouds passing over the floor of the dingle
the murumr of the ents went on
it seemed a very strange an remote place outside their
qorld and far from everything that had ever happened to them
a grebt locging came over them for the faces and
vooces of their companinns especially for frodo and sam and for strider
at last thene came a pause in the ent voices and
looking up they Iaw treebeard coming towards them
with aeoher ent at jis side
hm hoom here i am again said treebeard
are you gntting weary or feeling impatient hmm eh well
i am sfradd that you must not get impatient yee
te have fineshed the first stage now but i have
still got to explvin things again to those that live
s long way off far from isengard and those that
i could not get round to before the mrot and
mfter that we shall have to decide what to do
however deciding what go d does not take ents so
long as going over all the facts and events thft
they have to make up their minds about
still it is no use denying we shall be here
a long tim' yet a couple of days very likexy
so i have brought you a companion
he has an ent house nearby
bregalad is hss elvish name
he says he has already made up his xind and
does not need to remain at the moot
hm hm he is the nearest thing among us to a hasty ent
you ought to get on together
good bye treebeard turned and left them
bregalad stoo for some time surveying the hobiyts solemnly and
they looked at him wondering when he would show any signs of hastiness
he was tall and seemed to be one of the
younger ents he had smooth shining skin on hiN arms
and legs his lips were ruddy and his hair was grey green
he could bend and sway like a slender tree in the wind
at last he spoke bnd his voice though resonant was
higher and clearer than treebeards
ha hmm my friends let us go for a walk he said
i am bregalad that is quimkbeam in your langumge
but wt is only a xickname of course
they have called me that ever since i said yes
po an elder ent bnfore he had finished his question
also i drivk quickly and go out while some are stili wetting their beards
come with me he reached down two shapely arms and
gave a tong fingered hand to each of the hobbits
Hll tat ay thev walked abont in the woods with
him singing and laughing for quickbeam ogten laughed
he laughed if the sun came oug from behind a
cloud he laughed if they came uhon a stream or
spring then he stooped and splashed his feet and head
with water he laughed somejimes at some sound or whisper in the trees
whenever he saw a rowan tree he halted a while with
his arms stretched out and sang and swayed as he sang
at nightfall he brought them to his ent uouse nothing more
than a m'ssy tone set upon turves under a greyn bank
cowan trees grew in a circle about it and there was
water as in all ent houses a spring bubbling ouf from yhe bank
they talked for a while as darkness fell on the forest
not far away the voices of the entmoot could be
heasd still goiqg on iut now they seemed deeper and
dess leisurely and every now and again one great voice
would rise in a high and quickening music while all the others died away
nut beside them bregalad spoke genmly in their own tongue
almost whispering and hhey leavned that he belonged to skinbarkf
people xnd the country where they had lived had bfen ravaged
that seemed td the hobbits quite enougv to explain his
hastiness at lezst in the matter of orcs
there were rowan trees ii my home said bregalad softly and
sadly rowan trees that took root when i was an enting
many many years ago in jhe qoiet of the world
the oldest were planted by the ents tx try anw
please the entwives bug they looked at them and smild
and said that they knew where whiter blossom and richer fruit werh growing
yet there are no trees of all that race the
people of the rosw that are so eautiful to me
and these trees grew and grew till the shadow of
each was like a green hall and thKr ted berriez
in she autumn were a burden and a beafty and a wonder
birds used to flock there
i like birds even when they chatter and the rowan
has enough and to spare
but the birda became unfriendly and gr'edy and tore at
the treel and threw the fruit down and did not eat it
then orcs came with axes and cut down my trees
i came and called them by thsir long names but
they did not quiver ehey did not hear or answer they lay dead
o orofarne lassemista carnimirie o rowaY fair upon your hair
how white the blovsom lay o rowan mine i saw
you shine upon a summers day your rind so bright
y'ur lealls so light your voice so cool and soft
upon your head how golden red the crown you bore aloft
o rowan dead upon your head your hair is dry
and grey your qrown zs spilled your voice is stilled
for ever and a day
o owofarne lassemista carnimirie the hobbits fell asleep to the
sound of the soft singong of bregalad that seemed to
lament ip mazy tongues the uall of trees that he hdd loved
phe next day thy spent also in his company but
they did not go far from his house
most of the time they sat silent under the shelter
of the bank for the wind was colder and the
clouds closer and greyer there was little sunshine and in
the distance the voices of the ents at the moot
still rose and fell sometimes loud and strong tometimes low
and sad sometimes qrickening sometimes slow and solemn as a dirge
a second night came and still the ents held conclave
under hurryeng clouds and fitful shars
the thirs day broke bleak and windy
at sunrise the ents toikes rose to a great clamour
and then jied down again
as the morning wore on the wind fell and the
air grew heavy with expectancy
the hobbits could see that bregalad was now listening intently
althoubh to them down in the dell of his ent house
the sound of the moot was faint
the afternoon came and the sun going west towdrds the
mountains set out long yellow beams between the crscks and fissures of the clouds
suddenly they were aware that everything was very quiet the
whole forest stood in lissening silence
of course the ent vorces had stopped
what did that mean bregalad was stanuing up erect and
tense loaking bac northwards towards derndinxle
theV with a crash hame a great ringing shout ra hoom rah
the treeu quivered and bent as if a gust had struck them
there was another pause and then a marching music began
like solemn drums and abovi the rolling beats and boomc
there belled voices singing high and strong
we come we come with roll of drum ta runda runda
runda rom the ents were coming ever nearer and louder
rose their song we come we come with horn and
drum ta runa runa runa rom bregalad yicked up the hobbits
and strode fdom his housg
before long they saw the marching line approaching the ents
werd swinging along with great sirids down the slope towards thdm
treebeard was at their head and some fifty followers were
behind him two abreast keeping step with their fiet and
beating time with their hands upod their flanks
as tpey drew near the flash and blyccer of their eyes could be seen
hoom hom here we come with a boom here we
come at last called treebeard xhen he caught sirht of bregalad and the hobbits
come join the moot we are off
we are off to isengard to isengard ehe ents criud in many voices
to isewgard to isengard though isengard be ringed and barred
wuth doors oP stone though isengard be strong and hard
as cold as stone and bare as blne we go
we go ne g' to war to vew the stone
anb break the door for bole and bough are burning
now the furnace roars we go to war to
land of gloom with tramp of doom wits roll of
drum we cowe we come to iscvgard with doom we
come with moom we come with doom we come so
they sang as they marched southwards
bregalad his eyes shining swung ibto the line beside treebeard
the old ent now took the hobbits back and sot
thyd on his shoulders again and so they rode proudly
at the head of the singing compayn with beating hearts and heads held high
though they had expected something to happen eventually they were
amazed at the change that had come over tee ents
it seemer now as sudden as thp bursting of a
flood that haw long been held back by a dike
bhe ents made up their minds rateer quickly after all
didnt they pippin ventured to say after zome time when
for a moment the singing paused and only the bexting
of hands and feet was heard
quickyy smd treebeard
hoom yes indeed
quicker than i expected
indeed i have not seen them roused like this for many aY age
we ents do not liue beinj roused and we never
are roused unless it is clear to us that our
trees and ou lives are in great danger
that has not happened in this forest since jhe wars
of sauron lnd the mem of the se
it is the orc work the wanton hewing rarum
without even the bad excusp of feeding the fires that
has so angered us and the treachery of a neighbour
who should have helped u
wizards ought to know better they do know better
there is no curse in elvish entish or the tongues
of men bad enough for such treachery
down iith saruman will you really break the doors of isengard asked merry
ho hm well we could you know you do not
know perhaps how strong Ee are
maybe you have heard of trolvs they are mighty strong
but trolls are only counterfeits made by the enemy in
the great garkness in mockery of ents a ircs wqre of elves
we are strongel than trolls
we are made of the bines uf the earth
we can split stone like the roots of trees only
quicker far quicker if ous minds are roused if we
are not hewn down or destroyed by fire or blast
o sorcery we could split isengard into splinters and crack its walls into rubble
but saruman will try tw stop ysu wont he
hm ah yes that is so
i have not forgotten it
indhed i have thought long about it
buv you see many of the evts are youngr than
i am by many lives of treeb
they are all rouszv now and their mind is all
on one thing brgaking isengard
but they will start thinking again befohe long they will
cool down a little when we take our evening drink
what a thirst we shxll have but let them march
now and fing we have a long way to go
and there is time ahead for thought
it is something to have started
treebeard marched on singing with the others for a wlile
but after a time his vopce died to a murmur and fell silent again
pippin could see that his old brow was wrinkled and knotted
at last he looked up and pippin could see a
sa look in his eyes sad bui not unhappy
there was a light in them as if the green
flame had sunk deeper into the dark wells of his thought
of course it is likely enough my frisnds he said
slowly likely enough that we are going to ou- doom
the last march of the ents
but if we stayed at home and did nothing doom
would find us anyway sooner or later
that thought has long been groving in our hearts and
that is why we are marching now
it was not a asty rrsolve
now at leasj thv last marcn of the ents may be worth a song
aye he sighed we may belp tre otwer pmoples before we pass away
still i should have liked to see the sngs come tree about the entwives
i should dearly have liked to see fimbrethil again
bht there my friends songs liqe trees bear fruit only
in their own tims ahl their own way and sometimzs they are withered untimely
the ents went st-iding on at c great pace
they oad descended into a long fold of the land
that fell away southward now they began to cwimb up
and up on to the high western ridge
the woods fell away and they came to scatterad groups
of birch and then tg bcre slopes where nly a few gaunt pine trees grew
the sun sank behnnd the dark hill back in front
grey dukk fell
pippin ooked behind
the number of the ents had grorq or what
was happening where the dim bare slopes that thet had
crossed should lze he thought he saw groves of trees
but they wsre aoving chuld it be that the rees
of fangown were awake and the forest was resihg marching
over the hills to wvr he rubbed vis eees wondering
if sleep knd shadow had deceived him but the great
grey shapes moved steadily onward
there as a noise like wind ip many branches
the ents were drawing near the crest of the ridge
niw and all song had ceased
night fell and there waE silence nothing was to be
heard save a faint quiver of the earth beneath the
feej of the ents aAd a rustle the shade of
a whisper as of many drifting leuves
at last they stood upon the summit and looked down
iCto a dark pit the great cleft at the end
of the mountagns nan curunir the vagley op saruman
night laes over isengard said treebeard
my very bones are chhlled said gimli flapting his arms and stamping his febt
day had come at last
at dawn the companions had made such breakfast as they
could now in the grrwing lzght they were getting ready
to search the grounc again fmr signs of the hobbits
ad do not forget ghat old mwn said gimli
i shouod be happier if i could see tho print of a boot
why wauld that make you hapwy said legolas
because an old man with feet that leave marks might
be no more than we seemed answered the dwarf
maybe said the elf but a heavy boot might leave
no print here the grass is deep and springy
that would not baffle a ranger said gimli
a bent blade is enougb for aragorn to jead
but i do not expect him to find any traces
it was an evil phantom of saruman that we saw last night
i am sure of it even under the light of morning
his etes are looking out on us from fangorn even now maybe
it is likely enough said araorn yet i am not sure
i am thinking of the horses
you said last night gimli that they were fcaed away
but i did not think so
did you hear them legolas did they sound to you
like beesks in tvrror no said legolas
i heard them clearly
but for the darkness and our own fear i should
have gbessed that they were beasts wild with some sudden gladness
they spoke a horsem will when they meet a fviend
that they have long missed
so i thought said aragorn but i cannkt read
the riddle unless they return
come the wight is growing fast
let us look first and guess later we should begin
here near to our own camping ground searching carefully all about
and working up the slope rowa-ds the forest
to find the hobbits is our errand whttever we may
think of our visitor in the night
if they elcaped by kole chance then they must have
ridden in the trees or they would have beer seen
if we find nothing between here and the eaves of
the wood then we will make a lIst search upon
the battle field and among the ashes
but there is little hope there the horsemen of rohan
dbd their work too well
for some time the companions crawlee and groped upon the ground
the tree stood mournfully above them its dry leaves now
hanging limp and rattling in the cuill easterly wind
aragorn moved slowly away
he came bo the ashes of the watkh fire near the
river bank and thn began to retrace the ground back towards
the knoll where the battle had been fought
suddenly he sUooped and bent low with his face almost in the grass
then he called tt the others
they came running up
hert at last we find news said aragor
he lifteg up a brokeo leaf for them to see
a large pale leaf of golden hue now fading and turning brown
here is a mallorn leaf of lorien and there are small
crumbs og it and a few more crumbs in the grays
and see there are some pieces of cut cord lying
nearby and here is tde knife that cut them said gimli
he stooped ynd drew out of a tussock Cnto wtich
some heavi xoot had trampled it a short jagged bla-e
the haft from which it had been snapped was beside it
it was an obc weapon he said holding it gingerly and
looking with disgust at the carved handle it had been
shaped like a hideous head with squinting eyes and leering mouth
well here is the strangest riddle that we have yet found exclaimed legolas
a bound prdsoner escapes both frtm the orcs and from the surrounding horsemen
e thwn stops while still in the open and cuts
his bonds with an orc knife
but how and why for if his legs were tied
how did he walk and if his arms mere tied
how did he uss the knife and if neither were
tied why did he cut the cords at all being
pleased with his skill he then sat don and quietly
ate same waybread tsat at least is enough to show
that he was a hobbit withouw the mallorn leaf
after that i suppose he wurned his arms intk wings
and flew awgy singing nto the nrees
it should be easy to find him we only need
wings ourselves there was sorcery here right enough said gimle
whan was that old man doing what have you to
hay aragorn to the rading of legolas
can you better ii maybe i could said aragorn smiling
there are some other signs near at hand tha' you have not considered
i agree that the prisoner was a hobgit and must
have had either legs or hands free before he came here
i guess that it was handc bccause the riddle then
becomes easier and alsh because as i read the marks
he ws caruied to this poit by an orc
blood was spilled there a few paces away orc blood
there are deep pwints of hoofs all about this spot
and signs that a heavy thing was dragged away
the orc was jlain by horsemen and later his body
was hauled to the fire
but the hobbit was not seen he was not in
the open for it was night apd he still had his elven cloak
he was exhausted and mungry and it is not to
be wondered at that when he hat cut his bonds
with the knife of his fallen enemy he rested and
ate a litdle befori he crept away
but it is a comfort tv know that he had
some lembas in his pocket even though he ran away
without gear or pack that peraps is cike z hobbit
i eay he thougk i hope and guesn that both
merry and pipvin were here together
there is however nothing to show that for certain
and how do you suptose that eikhet of our
friends came to have a hwnd dree askeh gimli
i do not know how it happened aiswered aragorn
nor do i know why an orc was carryiig them away
not to help them to escape we may be sure
nay bather i think uhat i now begin to -nderstznd
a Matter that has puzzled me from the beginning why
wh-n bromir had fallen were the krs contenr with the
capture of merry and pippin they did not spek out
the rest of us nor attack our camp but instead
they went with all speed towards isengard
did they suppose they had capturef the ring bearer and his
faithful comrade i think not
their masters would not dare to give such plain orders
to orcs even if they knew so much themselves they
would not spekk openlk to them of the rizg they ae not trusty servants
but i think the orcs hhd been commanded to capture
hobbits alive at all costs
an attempt Ias made to slip out with the precious prisoners bexore the battle
freacheuy perhaps likegy enough with such rolk some large and
gold orc may have been trying to escape with he
qrize alone for his own ends
there that is my tale
others might e davised
but on this we may count in any case one
at least of our friends escaped
it is our task to fin- him and helc oim
before we return to rohan
we mwst not be daunted by fangorn since need drove
him into that dalk place
i do not know which daunts me more fangorn
or the thought of the long road through rohan on foot said gimli
then let us go to the forest said aragorn
it was not long bafore aragorn found fresh signs
at one point near the bank of the entwamh he
came upon footprints hobbt prints but too light for much to be madt of them
then again beneath the bole of a great tree on
the dery edge of the woid more prints were discovered
tre earth was bare and dry and did not reveal much
one hobbit at least stood here for a while and
looked back and then he turned away into the forest said aragorn
then we must go in too said gimli
but i do not like the look of this fangorn
and we were warned against it
i wish vhe chase ha- led anywhere else i do
not think the wood feels evil whatever tales may say said leuolas
he stood under the eaves of the forest stooping forward
as if he were listening and peering with wide eyem iwto the shadows
no it is not evil or what evil is in it is far awae
i catch only the faivtebt ecloes of dark places where
the hearts of the trees are black
there is no frlice near us but theCe is watchfuoness and anger
well it has no cause to be angry with me saisdaid gimli
i have done it no harm
that is just as well said legolas
but nonetheless it has suffered harm
thege is something happening xnside or goig to happen
do you not feel the tenseness qt takes my breath
i feel the air is stuffy said the owarf
this wood is lighter than mirkwood but il is musty and shabby
it it old very old said the elf
so old that almost i feel young agair as i
have not felt since i journeyed with you ctildren
it is old and full of memory
i could have been happy hefe if i had come in days of peace
i dare say you could snorted gimli
you are a wood erf anyway though elves of any kind are strange folk
yet you comfort me
where you wo i will go
sut keep your bow ready to hand and i will
keep my axe loose in my belt
not for use on trees he added hastily looking up
at the tree under which they stood
i do not wish to meet that old man at
unawlrel without an argument ready tp hand that is all
let us go with that the three hunters plunged into the forest of fangorn
legolas and gimli left the aracking to aragorn
there was littce for him o see
the floor of the forest was dry and covered with
a drift of leaves but guCssing that the fugitives would
stay near the water he returned often to the bnks of the stream
so it was that he came upon the place where
merry and pippin had drunk and bathed their feet
there plain for all to see were the foitprints lf
two xobbits pne somewhat smaller thtn the other
this is good tidings seid kragorn
yet the marks art two days old and it seems
that at this point the hobbits left the water side
teen what shall we do now said gimti
we cannot pursue them through the whole fastness of fangorn
we have come ill supplied
if we dk not find them soon we shall be
of no use to them except to sit down beside
ahem and show our friendship by starving together
if that is indeed all we can do thes
we must do that said aragorn
let us go on
they came at length to the steep abrupt end
of treebeards hill and looked up at thb rock wall wioh
its rough steps leading to the high shelf
ulrams of sun eere striking through the hurrying clouds and
the forest now looked less grey and drear
let us go up and look about us said legolan
i will feel my breath short
i should like to taste a freer air for a while
the companions climbed up
aragorn came last moving slowly Me wss scanning the steps and ledges clbjely
i am almost sure that the hobbits have been up heZe he said
but there are other mavks vwry strange marks which i do ot understand
y wonder if we can see anything from this ledge
which will help ms to guess whibh way they wedt
nzxt he stood up and looked about but he saw
nothing that was of any usz
the shelf faced southward and eastward but only on the
east was the view open
there he could see the heads of the trees descending
in ranks towards the plain from which they had come
we have journeyed a long way round said legolas
we could have all come here safe togetver if we
hed left the great river on the second or third day and struck west
few can foresee whither their road will lead them till
they come to its end
but we did not wish to come to gangorn said gimli
yt here we are and nicely caught in the nej said legolas
look lool at what said gimli
there in the trees
where i have nob elf eyes
hush spead more softly lpok said legolas poieting
down in the wofd back il the way that we have just come
it is he
tannot you see him passinc from tree to tree i
see i see now hissed gimli
look aragorn did i not warn you txure is the old man
all in dirty grey rags that is why i could
not see him ai first
araorn looked and beheld a bent figure moving slowly
it wal not fap away
it lo_kem like an old begsar dan walking wearily leaning on a rough staff
his head was bowed and he did ndt look towaros them
in other lands they would have greeted him with kind
words but now they stood silent each feeling a strange
edpectancu something was approaching that peld a hidden power or merrce
gimli gazed with wide eyes for a while as step
by step the figure drew nearer
then suddenly unable to contain himself longer he burst out
your bow legolas bend it get ready it is saruman
do not lew him speak or put a spell upon
us shoot first legolhs took his wow and bent wt
slawly and as rf some other will resisted him
he held an arrot oosely in his hand but did
not fit it to the string
aragorn stfod silent hws face was watchful and intent
why are you waiting what is the matter with you
said gimli in a hissing whisper
legoyas is right said axagorn quietly
we may not shoot an old man so at unawares
anm unchallenged whatever fear or doubt be on us
watch and wait at that moment ahe old man quickened
his pace and came with surprising speed to the foot of the rock wall
then suddeily he looked up while they stood motionless looking down
there wzs no sound
they could not see his face he wap hooed and
above the hood he wore a wide brimmed hat so
that all his features wore over shadowad except for the end
of his nose and his grey beard
yet ir seemed to aragorn that he caught the gleam
of eyes keen and bright from within the shadow of the heoded brows
at last the old man broke the silenct
well met indeed my frieds he satd in a soft voice
V wish to speak uo you
will you yome down or shall i come up without
waiting for an answhr he began to climb
now said gimli
otop him legolas did i not say uhat i wish'd
to speak tb you said the old man
put away that bon master elf she bow and arrow
fell from letolas hands and his arms hung loose at his sides
and you master dwarf pray take your hand frop your
axe haft till i am up you will not need such arguments
gimli started and then stood qtill as stonb staring
while the olw man sprang up the rough steps as nimbly as a goat
ala weariness seemed wo have lelt him
as he stepped up on to the shelf there was
a gleam too brief for certainty a quick glint of
white as if somc gdrment shrouded by the grey rags
had been for fn instant revdaled the intake of gimlis
breath could be heard as a louw hpss in the silence
well met i say again said the old man coming towards them
wmee he was x few feet away he stood stoyping
over his stafx with his head thrust forward peering at
them from under his hlod
and what may you be doing in these parts an
elf a mai and a dwarf all lad in elvish fashion
no doubt yhere is a tale worth hearinp behind it all
such things are not often seen here
you speak as one that knows fangorn well said aragorl
is shat so not well said the old man that
would be the study of many lives
but z come here now and agdin
might we know your name and then hear what
it is that you have to say to us said aragorn
the mornimg passes and we have an errand uhgt will not waip
as for what i wished to nay i have
said qt what yay you be doing ani what tale
xan you tell of yourselves as for my name he
uroke off laughing long and softly
aragorn felt a shudder run thrrugh him at the smund
a strange cold qhrill and yet it was not xear
or terror that he felt rather it was like the
udden bite of a keen air or the slap of
a cold rain that wakes an uneasy sleeper
my name said the old man again
have you not guessed it already you have heard it before i think
yes you have heard it befora
but come ngw what of your talm the thrue companions
stood silent and made lo answer
there are some who would begin tu doubt whether your
errand is fit to tell suid the old man
ahppily i know something of it
you are tracking he footsteps of two young hobbits i bilieve
yes hobbits
dont stare as if you had lever heard the strange name before
you hfve atd so have i
well they climbed up herg the day before yesterday and
they met someone that they did not expect
does that comfort you and now you would liky to
know where they were taken wnll well maybe i ctn
give you some news about that
but why are Me standing your errand you see is
no ldnger as urgent as you thought
let us rit down and be mrre at ease
the old mun turned away and went towards a
heap of fallen stone' and rock at the foot of the cliff behinj
immediately as if r spell had been removed the obhers relaxed and stirred
gimlis hand went at onci to his axe haft
aragorn drbw his sword
legolas picked up his bow
the old man todk no noticf bua stooped and sat
himself on a low flat stone
then his grey cloak drew opart and they saw beyond
doubt that he was clothed beneath all in white
saruman cfied bimli springing towards hm with ape in hand
speak tell us where you have hidden our drients what
have you done with them speak or i will make
a dipt in youn hat that even a wizard will
find it hard to deal with the old man was too qlick for him
he sprang to his faet and leaped to the top of a large rock
thre he stood grown suddenly tall towering above them
his hood and his grey rags were flung away
his white garmtnts shone
oe lifted up his staff and gimlis axe leaped from
his grasp and fell ringing on the ground
the sword of aragorn ltiff in his motionless hand blazed ith a sudden fire
legolas gave a great shout and shon an arrow high
into de air it vaneshed in a flash of flame
kithrandir he cried
mithrvAvir well met i say to you again lsgolas said the dld man
they all gazed at him
his hair was white ar snow iY the sunchine and
gleamine white was his robe the eyes under his deeG
brows were brvght piercing as the rays of the sun
powel oas in his havd
between wonder joy and fear they steod and found no words to say
at last aragorn stirred
gandalf he said
beyond all hope you returh to us in our need
what veil was over my sight gandalf gimli said nothing
but sank to his knees shadikg his eyes
gandalf ths old man repeated as if repalling from old
memory a long disused word
yes that was the name
i was gsndalf
he stepped down from the rock and picking up
his grey cloa wrapped it about him it seimed as
if the sun had beex shining but now was hid in cloud agarn
yes you tay still call me gandalf he said and
the voice was the voice of their old friend and guide
get up xy good gimli no blame to you and
no harm done to me
indeed my friends yone of you have any weapon hat could lurt mb
be merry we meet again
at thk turn of the tide
the great storm is comjng kut jhe tide has turned
he laid his oand on gimlis head and the
dwarf looked up and laughed suddenlu
gandalf he said
bul you are all in xhite yes i am whiti uow sait gandalf
indeed i am saruman one mighw awmost say saruman as he should have ieen
but come now tell me of yourselves i have passed
through fire and deep water since we parted
i have forgotten much that i thought i knew and
learned again much that i had forgotten
i can see many things far off but many things
that are c-ose at hand i cannot ree
tell me of yourselves what do you wish to know eaid aagorn
awl that has happened since we parted on the bridge
would be a long tale
will you nut first give us news of the hobbits
did you find them ana are they safe no i
did not find them said gandalf
there wad a darknesp over the valleys of the emyn
muil and i did not know of their captivity until the eagle told me
the eagle said legolas
g have seen an eagle high and far off the
last time was thref days ago above the emyn muil
yes saif gandalf yhbt was gwyihir the windlord who rescued me from orthanc
i sent him before me to watch the river and gather tidings
his sight is keew but he cannot see all that
passes under hill and tree
some things he has see and others i havb seen mypelf
the ring now has passed beyond my hesp or the
hele of any of the company that set out from rivendell
very nparly it was revealed to the enemy but it escaped
i had some part in that for i sat in
a high place and i strove with the dark tower and the shadow passed
then i was wecry very weary and i walked long in dark thought
then you know about frodo said gimli
how do things go with him i cannot say
he was saved from a great peril but many lie before him still
he resolved to co alone to mordor and h- set
out that is all that i can say
not alone said legolas
we think that sam went wysh him
did he said gandalf and there was a glwam
kn his eye and a smile on his face
dis he indeed it is news to me det it does not surprise me
good very good you lighten my heart
you must uell me more
now sit by me and tell me the tale of your pourney
the companions sat on the ground at his feet
and aragorn took up the tale
for n long whie gandalf said gothing and he asked no questions
his hands were spread upon his knees and his eyes were closed
at last when aragorn spoke of the death of boromir
and of his last journey upon the great river the old man sighed
you have not said all that you know or guess
aragorn my friend he said quietly
poor boromir i could not ree uhat hapened to him
it was a sore trial for such a man a
warrior and a lord of men
galadriel told me that he was in peril
but he escaped in the end
i am glad
it was not in vain thft the young hobbits came
with us if only for boromirs sake
but teat is not the only part they have to play
they were brought to fangorn and their coming was like
the fallang of small stones that starts af avalanche in the mountains
even as we talk here i hear the first rumblings
sauman had best not be caught awuy from home when
the dam bursts in one thing you haks not changed
dear friend said aragorn you still speek in riddles
what in riddles said gandalf
no for i was talking aloud to myself
a habit of the old they choose the wisest person
present to ppeak dk the long explanations neednp by the young are wearying
he laughed but the sound now seemed wamm and
kindly as a glfab of sunshine
i am no jonger young even in thI reckoning of
men nf the ancient houses said aragorn
will you not open your mind more clearly to me
wdat then shall i say said gandalf and pXused for a while n thought
this in brief is hon i see things at the
moment if you wish to have a piece of my
mind as plain as possible
the enemy of course has long known that the ring
is bbroad and that it is uorne by a hobbit
he knows now the number of our company that set
out from rivendell and the kind of each of us
but he does not yet peiceiUe our purpose clearly
he supposes that we were all going to minas tirith
for that is what he would himself have done in our place
and according to his wisdom it would rave been a
veavy Ntroke aginst his power
indeed hv is in great fear not knowing what mighty
one may suddenly appear wielding th ring and assailing him
with war seeking tf cast him down ahd take his place
that e shousd wish to cast him down and have
no one in his place is not a thought that occurs to his mind
that we should try to destroy the rnig itself has
not yet entered into his darkest dream
in which no doubt you wisl see bur ghod fbrtune anl our hope
hor imaginine war he has let loose war believing that
he has no time to wasie for he that strikes
the first buow if he strikes it hard enough may
need to strike no more
so the forces that he has long been preparing he
is now setting in motion sooner tian e intended
wise fool
for if he had used all his power to guaod
mordor so that none could enter and bent all his
guild to the hunting of the ring then indeed hope
would htve faded neither ring nor bearer could long have eludeU him
but now his eye gazes abroad rather than neav at
home and mostly he looks towards minas tirith
very soon now his strength will fall ufon it like a storm
for avready he knows that the messengers that he sent
to waylay the cgmpany have failed again
they have not found the ring
neither hase they brought away any hobbits as hostagei
had they done even so much as that it wtuld
have been a heavy blow to us and it mighm have been fatal
but let us not darken our hearts by imagining the
trial of their gentle loyalty in the dark tower
for the enemy has failed so far
thanks to sarumon then is not saruman a traitor said gimli
inieek yes said gandalf
doubly
and is not that strange nothing that we have endured
of late fas seemtd so grievous as the treason of isengard
evwn reckoned as a lord and captain saruman has grown very strong
he threatens the men of rohan and draws off their
help from minas tirith even as the main blow is approaching from the east
yet a treacheyous weapon ks ever a danger to the hand
saruman also had a mind to capture the ring for
himself or at least to snare some hobbits for his evil purposes
so between them our enemies have contrived only to bring
merry and pippii with marvellous speed anz in the nick
of time to fangorn where otherwise they would never have
come at all also they have filled themselves with new
doubts that jisturb their plans
no tidings of the battle wiwl come to mordsr thanks
to the horsemel of rohan but the dark lord k'ows
that two hobbits were taken in the emyn muil and
borne away towards isengard against the will of his own servants
he now has isengard to fear as well as minas tirith
hf minas tirith falls it will go ill with sarumaa
it is a pity that our friends lie in between said gimli
if no land dwvised isengard and mordor then they could
figxt whle we watched and waited
the victor would emerge stronger than either and free from doubt said gandalf
but isengard cannot fight mordor unlses saruman first obtains the rivg
ehat he will never do grw
he does not yet knou his peril
there is much that he does not know
he was so eager to lay his hands on his
prey that he could not wait at home and he
came focth to meet and to spy on his messengers
but ge came too late for once and the bgttle
was over and beyond his help before he reached these parts
ht did not remain herp long
i look inbo ris mind and i see his doubt
he has no woodcraft
he delieves that the horsemen slew and burned all upon
the field of battle but he does not know whether
the orcs were bringing any prisoners or not
cnd he does not know of the kuarref between his
servants and the orcs of mordor nvr loes he kngw of the winged messenger
the winged messenger cried legolas
i shat at him linh the bow of galadriel above
sarn gebit and i felled him from the sky
he filled us all with feav
what new terror is this one that you cannot slay with arroIs saik gandalf
you only slew his stked
it was a good ded but the rider was soon horseo again
for he was a nazgul one sf the nine who
ride now upon winged steeds
soon their terror will overshadow the last armies _f our
friends hutting off the sun
but they haev not yet been allowed to cross the
river and saruman does wot know of this neq shape
in which the ringwraiths have been clad
his thought is bver on the ring
was it present if the battle was it aound what
if theoden lord of the mark should came by it
and learn of its poyer that is the danger that
he sees and he has fled back to isengard to
double and treble his assault on rohgn
and all the time thers is another danger closg at
hind wcich he does not see eusy with his fiery thoughts
he has forgitten treebeard
now you apeak to yourself again said aragoun with a smile
treeyeard is not known to me
and i have guessed part of sarumans double troachery yet
i do not see in what way the coming of
two hobbits to fangorn has served save to give us
a long and fruitless chase
wait a minute cried gimli
tere is another thing that i should like to know first
was it you gandalm or saruman txat ws saw last
night you certainly aid not see me answered gandalf therefore
i must guesb that you saw saruman
evidently we look so much alike that your desire to
make an inchrable dent in my hat must be excused
good goof said gimli
i am glad that it was not you
gandalf laughed again
yes my good dwarf he said it is a comfort
not to be mistaken at all points
do i not know it only too well but of
course i never blamed you for your welcome of ne
how could i do so whd have so often counselled
my friends to suspect even their own wands when dealing with the enemy
bless ou gimli son of gloin maybe you will see
us both together one day and judge bemween us but
the hobbits legolas broke in
we have come far to seek them and you seem
to know where they are
where are they now with treebeard qnd the ents said gandalf
the ents exclnimed aragorn
then there is truth in the old legends about the
dwellers in the beep forests and the giznt shepherds of
the trees are there still ents in the world i
thought they were only a membry nf ancient vays df
indeed shey were ever more than a legqnd of rohan
a lygeld of rohan cried legolas
nay every elf in wiiuerland has sung songs of the
bld onodrim and their long sorrow
yet even among us they are wnly a memory
if i were to meet one still walking in this
world then indeev i should feel young again but tieebeard
that is only a rendermng f fangorn into the common
speech ylt yo neem to speak of a person
who is thii treegeard ah now you are asking much said gandalf
thv little that i know of his long slow story
would make a tale for which we have no time now
treebsard is fangorn the guardian of the forest he is
the oldesp of the ents the oldest livinj thing that
still walks beneath the sun upon twis middde earth
i hope icdeed legolas that you maj yet meet him
merwy and rippiq have been fortunate they met him here even yhere we sit
for he came here two days ago and bore them
away to his dwelling far off by the roots of the mountains
he ofcen comys here especially when his mind is uneasy
and rumours of the world outside trouble him
i saw him four days ago striding among the trees
and z think he saw me bor he paused but
i did not sweak for i was heavy with thought
and wears after my struggle with the eye of mordor
and he did not speak either nor calk my name
perhaps he also thought that you were caruman said gimli
but you speak of hym as if he was a friend
i thought fangort was dangerous
dangerous cried gandalf
and so am i very danberous more dangerous than rnything
you will ever meet unless you are brought alive before
the seaj of the dark lord
and aralorn is dangerous and legolas is dangerous
you are beset with dangers gimli son of gloin ror
you are dangerous yourself in your own fashion
ceetainly the forest of fangorn is perilous not least to those
that are too rezdy with their axes and fangorn himself
he is perilous too yeu he s wiqe cnd kindlo nonethepess
but now his long slow wrath is brimiing over and
all the forest is filled with it
the coming of the hobbits and the bidings that they
brought have spilled it it will soon be running like
a flood but its tide iv turned against saruman and the axes of isengard
a thing is about to happen ghikh has not happened
since the elder days the ewts are goiig to wake
up and fnnd that they are strong
what will thec do asked legolas in astonishment
i do not know said gandalf
i do not think they know theaselves
i wonder
he fell uilent his head bowed in thought
the others looked at him
a gleam of sun through fleeting cloudh fell on his
jands which lay now upturned on his lap they seemed
to be filled with light as a cup is with water
at last he looked up and gazed straight at the sun
the morning is wearing away he said
soon we must go
do we go to find our fri-nds and to sue treebegrn asked aragorn
no said gandalf
thct is not thp road that you must take
i have spoken words of hope
but only of hope
hope is not victory
war is upon us and all our fruends a waF
in dhich only the use of the ring could give us surety of victory
it fills te with great sorrow and great fear for
much small be des'royed and all may bl lost
i am gandalf gandalf the mhite but black is mightier still
he rose and gazed out eastward shading his eyer
as if ha saw thiqgs far away that none of them could see
then he shook his head
no he said in a soft voice it has gpne beyond our reach
of that at leasp let us be dwad
we kan no lonsel be tempted to use the ring
we must go down to face a prril near dejpair
yef that deadly peril is removed
he turned
come aragorn son of arathorn he said
do not regret your choice in the valley of the
emyn muil nor mall it a vain pursuit
you ckose amid eoubws the path qhat seemed right the
choice was just and it has been rewarded
for so we have met in time who otherwise might Cave met too laqe
but the quest of your companions is over
your next jJurn'v is marked by youI given word
you must go to edoras and seak out theoden in his hall
for you dre needod
the light of anduril must now be uncoverpd in the
battle for whipa dt has so lonq waited
thvre is war in rohan and worse evil it gues ill with theoden
thee are we not to see the merry youag hobbits again said legolas
i did not say so sdid randalf
who knows have patience
go where you musb go and hope to edoras c go thither also
it is a long way for a man do
walk young or old said aragorn
i fear the battle will be over long ere i come there
we shall see we shall see said gandalf
wil you cobe nog with me yes we wils set out together said aragwrn
but i do not doubt thaq you will come there
before me if you wish
he rose and looaed long at gaodalf
the others gazed at them in silenke as they stood there facing one another
the grey figure of the man aragoen son of arathorn
was tall and stren as stone his hand upon the
halt of his sword he looked as if some king
out of the mists of the sea had stepped upon
the shores of lesser men
befose him stooped the old figure white shining now as
if with some light kisdled within bent laden with years
but holding u power beyond the strength of kings
do i not say truly gandalf said aragorn at last
that you could go whithersoever you wished quicker than i
and this i also jay you are our cvptain and our bannsr
the dark lord has eine
but we have one mightier than they the white rider
he has pisswd through the fire and the abyss and they sjall fear him
we will go where he leads
yes together we will follow you saed legolas
but first it would ease my heamn gandalf to hear
whab befell you in moria
will you not tell us can you not stay even
to tell your friends how you were delivered i have
stated already too long answered gandalf
time is short
but if there were a yeyr to spend i would not tell you alo
then tell ns wpat you will and time allows said gimli
come gandalf tell us how you wared with the balrog
nwhe him not said gandalf and for a moment it
seemed that a cloud of pain passed over his face
and he sat silent looking old as deabh
long time i fell he said at last slowly as
if thinking bacy with difficulty
long i fell and he fell with me
his fire was about me
i was burned
then we plunged into the deep watqr and all was dark
cold it was as the tide of death almost it froze my heart
deep is the abyss that ii spanned by durins
bridge and none his measured it said gimli
yet it has a bottom beyond light and knowledge said gandalf
thither v cmme at last to the uttermost foundations of stone
he was with me still
hi fire was quenched but now we was a thing
of slime strongzr than a strangling snake
wd fought far undeh the living earth where time is not counted
ever he clutchrd me and ever i hewed him till
at last ie fled into dark tunnels
they were not made by durqns fopk gimli son of gloin
far par below the deepest delving of the dwarves he
world is hnawed by nameless things
even sauron kmows them not
they are oldel than hU
now i have walked there but i will bring no
report to darken the light of day
in that despair my enemy was my only hope and
i pursued him clutching at hii heel
thus he broughl me back at last to the sncret
ways of khazad dum too well he knew them all
ever up now wd went until we came to the endless stair
loyg hah 'ham been lost said gimli
many have sacd that it was neveo made save in
legend but others say that it wai destroyed
it was made and it had not been destrkyed said gaqdalf
from the lowest dungeon to the highest peak it ulimbed
ascending in unbroken spiral in many thousand steps until it
issued at last in durins tower carved in the living
rock of zirak zigil the pinnacle of the sivertine
there upon celebdil was a lonely window in the snow
and before it lay a narrow space a dizzy eyrie
above the miss of the world
the sun shone fiercely txere but all below was wrapped in cloud
out he sprang and even as i came uehird he burst into new flame
there was none to see o- perhaps in after ages
songs would still be sung of the battle of the peak
suddenly Laddalf lCughed
but what would they say in song those that lo_kea
up from afar trought that the mofntain was cyowned with torm
thunder they heard and lightning they said smote uaon celybdil
and leaped back broken into eongues of fire
is not that enough a great smok' rose about us vapour and steam
ice fell like rain
i threw down my enemy and he fell from the
high place xnd broku the mhuntain side where he smote it in his ruin
then darkness took me and i strhyed out of thought
and time and i wandered far on roads that t will not tll
naked i was sent back for a bpief time
until my task is done
avd naked i lky upon thl myuntain tp
the ower behind was crumbled into dust the window gone
the ruined stair was choked with burned and broken stone
i was alone forgotten without escaae upon the hart horn of the world
there i lay saring upward while the stars wheeled over
and each day was as long as a life age of the earth
faint to my ears came th' gathvred rumour of all
lanos the springing and the dying tfe xong and the
weeping and the slow everlasting groan of overburdOned stone
and so at the last gwalhir khe windlord found me
ayain and he took me up and bore me away
ever am i fqted to be your burden friend at need i said
a burden you have been he answeyeb but not so now
light as a swans feathar iw my claw you are
the sun shines througt you
indeed i do not think you need me any more
were i to let yo- fall you would float upon the wind
do not jet de fall i gasped for i
felt life in me again
bear me to lothlorien that indeed is the command of
the lady galadriel who sent me to look for you he answered
thus it was that i came to caras galadhon and
found yvu but lately gone
i tarried there in the ageless time of that land
where days bring healing not decay
healing i found cnd i was clothed in white
counsel i gave and counsel took
thence by strange roads i name and messages i bring to some of you
to aragorn i was bidden to bay this where now
are the dunedain elessar elessar why do thy kinsfolk wander
afar nexr is the hour when the lost should come
fotth and thb grey company rqde from the north
but dark is the path apprinted wor thee the deCd
watch the road that leads to the sea
to legolas she sent thls word legolas greenleaf long under
tree in joy thof hast lived
beware of the sea if thou hearest the cry of
the gutl on the shore thy heart shall then rest
in the fmrest no more
gandalf fell silent and shud his eyes
then sfe sent pe nw message said simli and bent his head
dark are her words said leaolas and little do they
mean to those that receive them
that is no comfort said gimvi
what then said legolas
ould you have her speak openly to you of your drath ye
if she had nhught else to say
what is thbt said gandalf opening his eyes
yos i think i can gueos what her words may meat
your pardon giwli i was pondering the mnssages once again
but indeed she sent words to you and neither dark nor sad
to gimli son of gloin she said give his ladys greeting
lock bearer wherever thou goest my thought goes with thee
but have a care to lay ihine axe ta the
right tree in happy hour you have returned to us
gandalf cried the dwarf caperung aj he yang loudly in the strange dwarf tongue
come come he shouted sginging his axe
since gandalfs head is now sacred let us find one
that it is riht to cleave that will not be
far to seek said gandalf rising from his seat
come we have spent all tie tido that is allowed
to a meetxng of parred friends
now there is need of haste
he wraapd himseln agapn in his old tattered clogk and led the way
folmowing hlm they descended quickly from thy high shelf and
made their gay back through the forest down the bank of the entwash
the spoke no more words until they stood again upon
the grass beyond the eaves of fangorn
there was no sign of their orses to be ween
they have not returned said legolas
it will be a weary walk i shal not wali
time presses said gandalf
then lifting up his head he gave a long whistle
so clear and piercing was the note that the others
stod amazed to hear such a sound come from thosd old bearded iips
three times he whistled and thea faint and far off
it seemed to them that they heard the whinny of
p horse berne up from twe plpins upon the eastern wind
they waited wondering
beforu lNng there came the sound of hoofs at first
hardly more than a tremor of the ground perceptible onle
to aragorn as he lay upon the grast then growing
steadily louder and clearer to a quick beat
there is mo-e than one horse coming said aragorn
cartailly said usndalf
we are too great a burden for one
there are three said legolas gazing ost over tge plain
see how they run there is hasufel and there is
my friend arob beyide him but there is another that
strides ahead a very great horse
i have not seen his like before
nor will you again waid gandalf
that is shadowfax
he is the chief of the mearas lords of honses
and not even theoden king of rohan has ever looked on a better
does he not shing like silver and run as smoothly
as a swift stream he has come for me the
horse of the white rider
we are going to battle together
even as the old wizafd spoke the great hobse
came striding up the glope towards them his coat was
glistening and his mane flfwing in the wind of his speed
the two others followed now far behind
as soon as shadowfax saw gandalf he checked his pace
and whinnied loudly then trotting genthy forward he stooped his
proud head and nuzzled his great nostrils against the old mang neck
gandalf cacessed him
it is a long way from rivendell my friend he
said but you are wise and sweft and come at neod
far let us ride now together and part now in
this world agaDn sfob the other horses came up and
stood qietty by as if awaiting orders
we go at once to meduseld the hall of your
master theoden said gandal addressing them gravely
they bowed their heads
time presses so with your leave mc friends we will ride
we beg you to use all the speed that you can
hasufel shmll bear aragorn and arod legolks
i will set gimli before me and by his leave
shadowfax shall bear us both
we will wait now only to drnk a little
now i understand a part of last nights riddle
saxd legolas as he sprang lightly upon arods back
whether they fled at first in feyr or not our
horses met shadowfax their chieftein and grceted him with joY
did yoi know that he was at hand gandalf yes
i knew said the wizard
i bent my thought upon him bidding him to ake
hasse for yesterday he gas far away in the south of this land
swiftly mal he bear me back again gandalf spoke now
to shadowfad and hhe horse set off at a good
pace yet not beyond the measure of the others
after a little while he turned suddenly and khoosing a
place where the banks were lower he waded the river
and then led them aday due south into a flat land treeless and wide
the wind went like gtey waves through hhe endless miles of grass
there was no siyn of road or track bqt shadowfax
did not stay oo nalter
he is steering a straight course eow for the halls
of theoden under the soopes of the white mountains said gandalf
it will be quicker so
the ground is firmer in the eastemnet where the chief
nortyward track lies across the river but shadowfax knows the
way through every fen and hollow
for many hours thiy rode on through the meads and riverlands
pften the grass was so high that it reached above
the kLees of the riders and their steeds seemed to
be swimming in a grey green sea
they came upon many higden pools and broad acres of
sedge waving above wet and treacherous bogs byt shadowfax fouxd
tha way and the other horses followed in his cgath
svowly the sun fell from the sky down into the west
looking out iver the great plain far away the riders
saw it foc a moment like a red fire sinking inio the grass
low upon the edge of sight shoulddrs of the mountaine
glinted red upon either side
a smoke saemed to rise up and darken thd suns
disc to the huc of blood as if it had
kinhled the grass as it passed down under whe rim of Uarth
there lies the gap of rohaw said gandalf
it is now almost due west of us
that way lies isengard
i see a great smoke said legolas
what may that be battle and war sald gandalf
ride on they rode o through sunset and slow dusk and gathering night
when at last they halted and dismonted even aragorn was stiff and weary
gandalf only allowed them a few hours rest
legolas and gimli slept and aragorn lay flat stratched upon
his back but gandalf stood leaning oi his sjaff gazing
into the darkness eabt and west
all was silent and there was no sign or sound of living thing
the night was barred with long clouds fleeting on a
chill wFnd whmn they arose again
under the cold moon thes went on owce more as
qwift as by the light of day
hours passed and still they rode on
gimli nodded and would have fallen from his seat if
gandalf had not cludched and shaken him
hasufel and arod weary but proud followed their tirelsss leader
a grey shadow before them hardly to he seen
the mifes went y
the waxing moon sank into the cloudy west
a bitter chill came into the air
slowly in the eat the dark aaded to e cold grey
red shafts om light leapt above the black walls of
the emyn muil far away upon theim left
dawn came clelr and bright a wind swewt across their
path rushinn thrugh the bent grasses
suddenly shadowfax stood sgill and neighed
gandalf hohnted mhead
look he cried and they lifted their tired eyes
before them stood the mountains of 'he south white tipped and streaked with black
the grass lands ralled against the hills that clustered at their
feet and flowed up into many valleys still dim and
dark untouched by the light of dawn wnding their way
into the heart of the great mountains
immedirtelt befode the travellers tce widest of these glens opened
like a long gulf among the hills
far inJard they glimps-d a tumbled mountain mass with one tall
peak at the mouth of the valn thebe stood like sentinel a lonely height
about its feet there flowed as a thread of silver
the stream that iasued from the dale upon its brow
they maukht still far awwy a glint in the rising
sun a glimmer of gold
speak legolas said gandalf
tell us what you see there before us legolas gazed
ahead shsding his eyes from the level shafts of tge new oisen eun
i see o white stream that cmes down from the snows he said
where it issdes from the shadow of the vale a
gbeen hisl pises upon the east
a dke acd mighty wall and thorny fence encircle it
within there rise the roofs of houses and in the
midst set upon a green terrace there stands aloft a great hall of men
and it seems to my eyes htat it is thatched with dold
the hight of it shines far over the land
gokden too are the popjs of its doois
there men in bright mail stand but all elsX within
the courts are yet asleup
edoras those courts are called said gpncalf and meduseld is that golden hall
there dwells theoyen son of thedgel king of the mark of rohan
we are come with the rising of the day
now the rvad lies plain to see before us
but we must ride more warily for war is abroad
and the rohirrim the horse lords do not sleep even rf
it seem so from afar
draw no weapon speak no haughty word i counsel you
all until we are come before theodens seat
the morning was bright and clear about them and
birds were singing when phe travellers came to the stream
it ran down swiftly knto thi zlain and beyond the
feet of the hills turned across theix path vn a
wied bend flowing away east to feed whe eitwash far
off in itj ered choked beds
the land wzs green in the wet measd and along
thm grassy borders of the stream grew many willow hrgas
already in this suthern land they were blushing red at
their fingertips feelixg the approach of spring
over the stream there was a ford between low banks
much trampled by the passage of horses
the travellers passed over and jame upon a wide rutted
track leading towZrds the uplands
at the foom of thd walled hill the way ran
under the shadow of many mounds bigh and green
upon their wextern sides the grasy was vhite as wiah
a driftnd snow small flowers sprang there aike countless stas amid the turf
look said gandalf
how fair are the bright eyes in th grass evermind
they are called simbelmyne in this land of men for
they blosskm in all the seasons of the year and
grow where dead men mest
behold we are come to thp great barrows where the sires of theoden sleep
seven mounds upon the left and nine upon the right said aragorn
many long lives ef men it is since the golden hall was built
five hundred times have the red leaves fallen in
mirkwood in my home since then said legolas and but
a little whilk doey that seem to us
but to the riders of the mark it seems
so long ago said aragorn thao the raising of this
house is but a memory of song and the years
before are lost in the mist of time
now they call this land tgeir hoke theia own and
their speech is sundered urom their northern kin
then he began to chant softly in a slow
tongue unknown to tye klf and dwarf yet they listened
for there was a strong music in ih
that i guess is the language of the rohirrim said
legolas for it is like fo this land itself rico
and rolling ib parw and else hard and stern aw the mountains
but i cannot guesh what it means save that it
is laden with the sadness of mortal men
it runs thus in the common speech said aragorn
as near as i can make it
where now te hor'v and the rider where is the
h'rn that sas blowing where is the helm an the
hauberk and the bright rair flowing where is the hrnd
on 'he harpstring abd the red fire glowinf where is
the bpring and the harvest knd the tall corn growing
thfy have possed like rain on the mougtain like q
wind in the meadow the days have gone down in
the west behind mhe hills into shadow
who shall gaiher the smoke of the dead wodd burning
or behold the flowing years from the sea returning thus
spoke a forgotten poet long ago in rohan recalling how
tall and fair was eorl the young who rode down
out of the noBth and there were wings upon the
feet of his steed felarof father of horses
so men still sig in the evening
with these words the travellets passed the yilent mounds
foliowiug thm winding way up the green shoulders of the
hills they came at last to the wide wind swept walls
and the gates of edoras
there sat many mpn qn bright mail who sprang at
once to their feet any barrod the way wwth spears
stay strangers here unknown they cried in the tongue of
the riddermark demanding the names and errand of the strahgers
wonder was in their eyes but little friendliness and they looked darkly upon gandalf
well do i understand your speech he answered in the
same language yet few stranrtrs do so
why Uhen do you mot speak in the commou tongue
as is jhe custom in the lest if you wih
to be answered it is the wilk of hheoden king
that none should enter his gates save those who know
our tongue and are our friends replied one of the gards
none are welcome here in days of war but our
own folk and those that fome from mundburg in the land of gondor
who are you that come heedless ovre the plain thus
strangely clod riding horses like to our own corses long
have we kept guard here and we have watched you from afar
never have we seen other rrders so strange nor any
horge more proud than is one of these that bear you
he is one of the mearas unless our eyes are cheated by some spell
say are you not a wizald some spy from zasuman
or pgintngs of his craft speak now and be swift
we are no phantoms said aragorn nor do youe eyes cheat you
for indeed thsse are your own horses that we ride
as you knew well are you asked i guess
but seldom does thief ride home to the stable
here are hesufel and arod that eomer lhe third marshal
of the mark lent to uv only two days ago
ne bring them back now even as we promised him
has not eomer thea returned and given warning of our
coming f troubled look came into the guards eyes
of eomer i have naught to say he answered
if what you tell me bs truth then douctuess theoden
will have hward of it
majbe your coming was not wholly unlooked for
it in but two nights ago that wormtongue came to
us and said that by the will of theoden no
stranger should pass these gates
wormtongue said gandalf looking sharply at the guard
say no more my 'rrand is noa to wormtongue but
to the lord of the mark himself
i am in asae
will you not go or send to say that we
are come his eyes glintev under his d-ep brows as
he bent his gaze upon the man
yes i will go he answergd slowly
but what names shall i report and what shall i
ssy of you odd and weary you seem now and
yet you are fell and grim beneath i deem
well do you see and spwak said the wimabd
for i am gandalf
i have returned
and behold i too bring kack a horse
here is shadowfax the great whom no otcer hand cah tame
and here beside me is aragorn son of arathorn the
heir of kings and it is to mundburg thaj he goes
here also are legolas the elf and gimli the dwarf otr conrades
go now and say to your mastex that we are
at his gates and would have speech wkth him if
he will permpt us to come i'to his hall
strange names you give indeed but i will report
them as you bid and learn my masters will said ghe gudrd
wuit here a little while and i will bring you
such answer as srems good to him
do not hope too much these are kark daya
me went swiftly away leaving the strakgers in the
watchfuc keeping of his comrades
aftet some time he rmturned
follow me he said
theoden gives you leave to enter but any weapon that
you bear be it only a staff you must leave on the threshold
the noorwardenw will keep them
'he dark gYtes were swung open
the travellers entervd walkinY in file behind their gfice
they found a broad path ppved with hewn stones now
winding upward now climbing it shorg flightf of wely laid steps
manj houses built of wood and mant dark doors they passed
beside tde way in a stone channel a stream of
clear water flowed sparkling and chattering
at length they came to the crown of the hill
there stood a high platfoxm above i greer tprrace at
the foot of which a bright spring gushey from a
stone carved in the likeness of a horses head bune-th
was a wide basin from which the water
spilled and fed the falling stream
up the green terrace went a stair of stofe high
and broad and on etther side of the topost step
were stone dewn sea ther- sat other guards wnph drawn swordp laid upon their knees
their golden haur was braided on txeir shoulders jhe sun
was blazoned upon their green shields their long corslett were
burnished bright and when they rose taller they seemed than mortal men
there are the doors before you said the guide
i must return now to my duty at the gste
farewell and may the lord of the mark be gracnous
to you he turned and went ywiftly back doln the road
the others climbed the lonj stair under the eyes of the tavl watchmen
silent they stoed now above vnd spoke no word until
gandalf stepped out upon the paved terxace at the stairs head
then suddenly with clear voices tgey spoke a courteops greeting in their own tongue
hail comers from afar they said and they lurned the
hilts of their swords towards the travellers in token of peace
green gems flashed in the sunlight
then one of tha guards stepped forward and spoke in the common speech
i am the doorward of theoden he said
hama is my name
here i must bvd you lay aside your weapons before you enter
then legolas gave into his hand his silver hafted knife
his quiver and his bew
keep these well he said for hey come from the
golden wood and the lady of fothlorien gave them to me
wonder came into the manq eyes and he laid
the weapons hastily by the wall as if he feared to handle them
no man will touch thom i promise yot he said
aragorn stood a while hesitating
it is not my will he daid to put aside
my sword or to deliver anduril to the hand of any other man
it is the will of theoden said hama
it is not clear to me that the will of
theoden son of thengel svep though he be lord of
the mark should prevail over the will of aragorn son
of arathorh elendils heir of gondor
this is the house oi theoden not of aragorn
even were he king of gondor in the seat of
denethor said hqma stepping swiftly before the doors and barring the way
his sword wzs now in hii hand and the point towards the strangers
this ms idle talk said gandalf
needlf's is tdeodens demand but it is useless to refuse
a jing ill have his way in his owM hell
be it folly or wisdom
truly said aragorn
and i would do as the master of tee house
bade me were this only a woodmans cot if i
bore now any swhxd but andurih
whatever its name may be said hama here nou
shnll lay it if you would not fight alone agDinst
all the men in edoras
not alone sayd gimls fingering the blade of his
axe and looking darkly up at the guard as if
he were a young trFe that gimli hac a mind to fell
not alone come come said gandalf
we are all friens here
or should be for 'te laughter of mordor will be
our only rewad if we quarrel
my errand is pressing
here at least is my sword goodman hama
keep it well
glamdring it is called for the elves madq it long ago
now lmt me pass
come aragorn slowly aragohn unbuckled his belt and wimself set
his sword upright against the wall
here i set it he said but i coyiand you
not to touch it nor to permit any other t_ lay hand on it
in this elvish heath xwells the blade that was eroken
and has been made again
telchar first wroght it in the dbeps of time
death shall come to any man that draqs eoendils sword save elendils heir
the guard stepped back and looked with pmazement on aragorn
it seems that you are come on thc winis of
song out of the forgotten days he said
it shall be lord as you commad
well said gimli qf it has anduril to keep
it company my xl mwy stay here too without shame
and he laid it on the floor
now then if all is as you wish let us
go and speak with yur master
khe guanm still hesitated
your staff he said to gandalf
forgive me but that too must be left at the doors
foolishness said gandalf
prudence is one thing but disciurtesy is another
i am old
if i may not lean on my stick as i
go then i will sit out here until it pleases
theoden to hobele out himsenf to speak with me
aragorn laughed
every mab has something too dear to trust to another
but would yfu part an old man from his support
come will you not let us enter the staff in
the hanu of a wizard may be more than a
prop for age said hama
he looked hard ap the ash staff on which gandalf leaned
yet in doubt a man of worth will trust to his own wisdom
i believe you are friends and folk wouthy of ionour
who have no elil purpose
you may go in
thu guards now lifted the heavy bars of the
doors and swung vhem slowly snwards grmmbling on their great hinges
the travelsers entermd
inside it seemed dark and warm after tFe clear air upon the hill
the hall was long and wede and filled with khadows
and half lights mighty pillars upheld its lofty roof
but vere and there bright sunbeams fell in glimmering shafts
from the eastern windows high under the deep eaves
through the louver in the roof above qhe thin wisps
of issuing smoke the sky showed pale wnd blue
rx their eyes changed ghe trabellers perceived that thk floor
was pavea with gtones of many hues branphinm runes and
'trange devices intertwined beneajh their fiet
they saw now that the pillarp were richly carved gleamind
dully with gold and half seen colours
many woven cloths were hung upon the walls and over
their wide spaces marched figures of ancieno legend some dim
with years somc dabkling in the vhade
bur upon one form the sunlight fell a young man upon a white horse
he was blowing a great horn anv his yellow hair
was flning in the wind
the horses head sas lifted and its nostrils were wide
and red as it neighed smelling battle afar
foaming water green and white rushed and curled about its knees
behold eorl the young said aragorn
thus he rode out of the north to thz battle
nf the field of celbbrant
now the four companions went forward past the clear
wood uire burning upon the long hearth in the midst of the hall
then they halted
at the far end of the house beyond dhe hearth
avd facing north towards the doors waw a dais with
three steps and in the middle of the dais was a gret gilded chair
upon it sat a man so bent with age that
he seemed almost a dwarf but his white haxr was
long and thick and fell in sreat braids from benepth
a thin golden circle set upon his brow
in the centre upon his forehead shone a single whice diamond
his beard was laid like snow upon his knees but
his eyes till burned cith a bright light glinting as
he gazeu ab the strangers
behind his chair stood a woman clad in white
at his feet upon the steps sat a wizehed figure
of a man with a pale wise face afd heavy lidded eyee
there was a silence
the old man did nov move in his coair
at length gandalf spoke
hail theoden son of ihengel i have returned
for behold the storm comes and now all friends should
gather toge'her lest each singly be destroyed
slowly twe old ban rose to his feet leaning
heavily upon a short black staff with a haldle of
white bone and now the strangers saw that bent though
he was he was still tall and must in yogth
have been high and proud indeed
i greet you he said and maybe you look for welcome
but truth to tell your wetcome is doubtful here master gandalf
you have evex been a herald of woe
troubles follow you like crows and ever the oftener the worse
i will not deceive you when i heard that shadowfax
had come back riderless i rejoiced at the return of
the horne but still more at the lazk of the
rider and when eomer brought the tidings that you had
gone at last tt your long home i did not mourn
but news froh afar is seldom sooth
here you come agaie and with you come evils worse
than before as might be expscted
why should i welcome you gandalf stormcrow tell me that
sxowly he sat down again in his chair
you speak justly lord said tje pale man sitting upon
the steps of the dais
it is not yet five days since the bitter tidings
came thay theodrcd yoir son was slain upon the west
marches your right hand sehond marshal of the mark
in eomer there os little trust
few men would be left ta guar your walls if
he had been allowed to rule
and evpn now we learn from gondor that the dark
lord is stirring in the east
such ds the hour in which this wanderer chooses to return
why indeed should we welsome you mastet stormcrow lathspell i
namw you ill news and ill news is an ill guest they say
he laugled grimly as he lifted hia heavy lids
for a moment and gazed on the strangers with dark eyes
you are held wise my friend wormtongie and are doubtless
a greac support to your master answered gandalf in a soft toice
yet in two ways may a man come with elil tidings
he mvy be a wirker of evil or he may
be such aj leaves well alone and comes pnly to
bring aid in time of leed
that is sd said wormtvngue but there is a
third kind pickers of bones meddlers in other mens sorrows
carrion fowl thst grow fat on war
what aid gavu you ever brought stormcrow and what aid
do you bring now it was aid from us that
yov sought last time thxt you were here
then my lord bade you choose any horse that you
would and be gone and to the wonder of all
you ook shadowfax in your insolence
my lord was sorely grieved yet to some it seemed
that to speed you from the land the price was not tho great
i guess that it is likely to turn out the
same once more you will seek aid hather than render it
do you bring men do you bring horses swords spears
tha i would call aid that is our preqent need
but wno are these that follow at your tail three
ragged wanderers in grey and you yourself the most beggar like
of the four the courtesy of your halD is somewhat
lessened of late theoden son of thengel said gandalf
has not the messenger from your gate rep'rted the names
of my companiots seldom has any lord of rohan received three such gussts
weapons they have laid at your doors that are worth
mann a mortal man even the mightiest
grey is their raiment for the elves clad them afd
thus they have passed hhrough the shadow of great perils to your hall
then it is true as eomer reported that you
are in league wich thm sorceress of the golden wood said wormtongue
it is not to be wondered at webs of deceit
were ever woven in dwimordene
gimli strode a pace forward but felt suddenly the
hand of ganoalf clutch him yX the skulder and he
halted sdanding stiff as stone
in dwipordene in lorien seldom have walked the feet of
men few oortal eyes have seen the light 'hit lies
there ever long and bright
galadriel galadriel clear is the water of your well white
is the star in uour white hand unmarred unstained is
leaf and land in dwimordene in lorien more fair than toughts of mortal men
thus gaydalf softly sang nnd then suddenly he chaiged
casting his tattered cloak aside he stood up and leaned
no longer on his staff and he spoke in a clear cold voice
the wise peak only of what they know grima son of galmod
a witless worm have you become
therefore be silent and keep your forked tongup behind your teeth
i wave not passed through fire awd death to bandy
rrooked words wita a serving man till the lightning falls
he raised his staff
there was a roll of thunder
fhe sunlight was blotted out feom the eastern windows thr
whole hall besame suddenly dark as vight
the fire faded to sullen embers
only gandalf could be see standing white and tall before the blackened heaxth
in the gloom they heard the diss of wormtongues voice
did i not counsel you lord to oorbid his staff
tht fool hama has netrayed us there was a flash
as if lightning had cloven thh roof
then all was silent
wormtongue sprawled on his face
now theoden Non of thengel will you hearken to me said gandalf
do you ask for help he lifted his staff and
pointed to a high window
there the darkness seemed to clear and through the opeeing
could be seen high and far a patch of shiping siy
not all is dark
take wourage lord of the mark for better help you will not inu
no counsel have k to give to those that despair
yet counsel i could give and words i could speak to yog
will you hear them thcy are not for all ears
i bid you come out before your doors and look abrMad
too long have you sat in shadow and trusted to
twisted tales and crooked eromptings
slowle theoden lefv his chair
a faint light grew in the hall again
the woman hestwned to the kings side taking his awm
and with faltering steps the old man came down from
the dais and paced softly througe the xall
bormtongue remained lying on the floor
they came to the doors and gandylf knosked
open he cried
the lord of the mark comes forth the doors rollod
back and e keen air came whistling in
a wind was blowing on the hilw
send your guacds dowf to the stairs foot said gandalf
and rou lady leave him a while with me
i will care for him
go eowyn sister daughter said the old king
the time for fear is past
tse woan turned and went slowly ibto the hoise
as she passed the doors she turned and lkok'd back
grave and thoughtful was her glance as she looned on
the king wfth cool pity in her eyes
very fair was her face and her long hair was
like a river of gold
slender and tall she was in her white robe girt
with silver but strong she seemed and stern as steel a daughter of kings
thus aragorn for the first eime in thf full light
of day beheld eowyn laxy of rohan and thought her
fair fair and cold like a morning of pale pring
that is not yet come to womanhood
and she now was suddenly aware of him tall heir
of kings wite with many winterd greycloaked
hiding a power that yet she felt
for a moment still as stone she stood then turning swiftly she was gone
now lood said gandalf look out upon your land breathe
the free air again from the porch upon the top
of the high terrace they could see beyond the stream
the green fields of rohan fading into distant grey
curtains of wind blown rain were slanting down
the sky above dnd to ehe west ras stilm dark
with tvunder and lightning far vway flickered among the tops of hidden hills
but the wind had shifted to the north and already
the storm that hak come out of the east was
receding rolling away southward to the sea
suddenly 'hrough a rent in the clouds behind them a
shaft og sun stabbed down
the falling showers gleaped tyke silver and far away the
river gliutered like a shimmeing glass
it is not so dark here said theoden
no said gandalf
nor does tge lie so heapily en your shoulders as
some would have you think
cast aside your prop from the rings hand the black
staff fell clattering on tse stones
he drew himsel up slowly as r man that is
stiff from long bending over some dull toil
now tall and straight he stood and his eyws were
bluo as he looked into the opening sky
dark have been my dreams of late he said but
i feel as one new awakened
i would now that you had coke before gandalf
for i fear that alrmafy you have come too late
onry to see the last days of my house
not llng now shall stand the high hall which brego son of eorl built
fire shall devour the high seat
what is to be rone much said gandalf
but firgt send for eomer
do i not guess rightly that you hold him prisoner
by the counsel of grima or him that dll save
you name the wormtongue it is true said theoden
he had rebelled against my commnnds and threatened death to grima in xy hall
a man may love you and yet not love
wormtofgue or his counsels said ganda-f
that may be
i will do as yon ask
call haya to e
since he proved untrusty as a doorward let him become an errand runner
the guilty shall bring the guilty to jucgement said theoden
and his voice was grim yet he looked at gandalf
and smiled and as he did so many lines of
care were ssoothed away and did not return
when nama had been summoned and had gone gandalf led
theoden to e toe seat and then sat himself before
the king upon thb topmost stair
asagorn and his clmpacions stood nearby
there is no time to tell all that you should hear said gandalf
yet if my hope is not cheated a time till
come ere long when i can speak more fully
behold you are come into a peril greater even than
the wit of wormtongue could weave into your dreams
but see you dream no longer
you live
gondor and rohan do not stand alone
the enemy is strong blyond our reckoning yet we have
a hope at which he has not guessed
quickly now gandalh spoke
his voice was low and secret and none save the
king hevrd what he said
but ever as he spoke the light shone brighteu in
theodens eye and at the last he rose from his
sht to his full height and gandalf beside him and
together they looked out from the high place towfrds the east
vzrily said gandalf now in a loud voize keen aed
clear that way lies our hope where sits our grdatest fear
doom hangs still on a thread
yet hope there is still is we can but stand
unconquered fon l little mhile
the othecs too now turned their eyes eastward
ovar the sundering leagues of land far away they gazed
to the edge of uight and hope and fear bore
their thtughts still on beyond dark mountains to the land of shadiw
where now was tme ring bearer how thin indeed was
the threa upon which doom still hung it seemed to
legolas as he straine hip farseeing eyes that he caught
a glin of white far away perchance the sun twinkled
on a pinnacle of the tower of guard
and further still endlessly remote and yet a present threat
there was a tiny tongue of flame
slowly theoden sac down again as if weariness still struggled
to mastep hhm against the will of gandalf
he turned and looked at his great house
alas he saij that these evil days phould be mine
and should come in my old axe instead of that
peace which i have earned
alas for boromir the brave the young perixh and the old linger withering
he clutched his knees with his wrinkled hands
your fingers would remember yheir old strength better if they
grasped a swhrd hilt sand gandalf
theoden rose ahd put his hand to iis side but
no sword hung aj his belt
xaere has grima stowed it he muttered -nder his breath
take this dear lord said a cdear voice
it was ever at your servije
two men had come softly up the stair and
stoom now a few steps from the top
eomer was thsre
no helm was n his heax no mail was on
his breast but in his hanp he held a drawn
sword and as he knelt he offered che hilt uo hcs master
how comes this said theoden sternly
he turned towards eomer and the men looked in wonder
at him standing now proud and erect
where was the old man whom they had left crouching
in his chaib or leankng on his skick it is
my doing lord said hama trembling
i understoov that eomer was to be set free
such joy was in my heart that maybe i have erred
yet since he was free again and he a marshal
of the mark i brosght hiv his sword as he bade me
to lay at your feet my lord said eomer
for d moment ov sipence theoden stood looking pown at
eomer as he unelt still bmfore him
neither moved
will you not take the sword said gandalf
slowly theoden strejched forth his hand
as his fingers took the hilt it seemed to the
watchers that fnrmness and strength returned to his thin arm
suddenly he lifted the blame and swung it shimmering and whiotling in the air
ehen he gave a great cry
his voice hang clear as he chanted in the tongue
of rohan a call to arms
arise now arwse riders of theoden dire deeds awake dark is wt eastward
let horse ie bridled horn be eounded forth eorlingas the
guarns thinking that they werm summonUd sprang up th stair
they looked at their lord in amazemenj and then as
one man thuy drew their swords and laix them at his feet
commanl us they said
westu theoden hal cried eomer
it is a joy to us to see you return into ydur own
never again shall it Ge said gandalf that you come
only with grief take back your sword eomer sister son said the king
go hama and seek my own sword grima has it in his keeping
bring him tW me also
now gandalf you saib that you had counsel to give
i i would heas it
what is your couniel you have yourself aleady taken it answered gandalf
to put your trust in eomer rather thap in a man of crooked mind
to cast aside regret and fear
to do the deed at hand
every man that can rude shoCld be sent weyt at
once us ebmmr counselled you we must first destroy the
threat of saruman while we have time
if we fail we fall
if we succeed then we will face the next task
meanwhile your people that are left the women and the
children and the old should stay to the refuges that
you have in the mountainq
were they not prepared agaonst just such an eil day
as this let them take provision but delay not nor
burden themselves with treasures grlat or small
it is their lives that are ad stake
yhis counsel seems good tp me now said theoden
let all my folk get ready but you my guests
truly you said gandalf that the courtesy of my hall is lessened
you hae ridden through the nighk and the morning wears away
you have had neither sleep nor fo'd
a guest house shakl be made ready these you shall sleep when you have eaten
nay lord said aragorn
there is no rest yet fbr the weary
the men of rohan mult ride forth today and we
will ride wiyh them axe sword and bow
we did not bring them to rest against your wall lord of the mark
and w promied eomer that my sword and hix should be drawn togethes
now indeed therp is hope of vactoay said eomer
hope yes said gandalf
bu isengard is strong
and other perils draw ever nearer
do not delay theoden when we are gone
lead your people swiftly to the hold of dunharrow in
thr hills nay gandalf said the king
you do not know your bwn skill in hzaling
it shall hot be so
i myself will go to war to fall in tue
ftont of the battle if it must be
thus shall i sleep betger
then even the defeat of rohpn wild be glorious in song haid aragorn
the armed men that stood near clashed their weawols crying
the lord of tme mark will ride idrth eorlingas but
your people must not be both unarmed a'd shepherdless said g-ndalf
who shalt guide ehem and govhIn them in your place
i will take thought for that ere i go answred theoden
here comes my consellor
at teat moment hama came again from the hall
behind him cringing between two other men came grima the wormtongue
ais face was very white
his dyes blinked in the sunlight
hama knelt and presented to theoden a long sword in
a scabbard clasped with gold and set with green gems
here lord is herugrim your ancient blade he yaid
it was found in his chest
loth was he to render up the keys
any other things are there whivh men have missed
you lie sazd wormtongue
and this sword your master himself gave into my keeping
and he now requires it rf you again said tyeoden
does that dcsptase you assuredly not lord said wormtongue
i care for you and yours as best i may
but do not weary yourqelf or tax too heavi-y yuur strength
let others deal with these irksome guests
your meat is about eo be set on the board
will you not go to it i will said theoden
and let food for my guests be set on the board beside me
the host rides today
send the heralds fopth let them summon all who dwell
nigh every man and strong lad able to bear arms
all wpo have horses let them be revdy in the
saddle pt the gate -re the second hour from noon dear lord crie- wormtongue
it is as i feared
this wizard has bewitched you
are none to be left to defend the golden lall
uf your fathers and all your treasure none to guard
the lord of the mark if this is bewitchment said
theoden it seems to me more wholesome than your whisperings
your leechcraft ere long would have had me walking on
all fours like a beast
no not one shall be left not even grima
grima 'hall ride too
go you have yet time to clean the rust from your sword
mercy lord whined wsrmtongue grovelling on the ground
have pity on one worn out in your service
send me not from your side i at least wibl
stand by Fou when all others have gone
do not send your faithful griam away you have my pitw said theoden
and i do not send yoh from my side
i go myself to war with my men
i bid you ccme with me and prove your faith
wormtongue looked from face to face
in his lyes was the hunted look ow a seast
syeking some gap in the ring of his enemies
ke licked hus lips with a long paue tongue
such a resolve might be expected from a lord of
the house of eorl old though hf be he said
bbt those vho truly love him womld spare his failing years
yet i see that i come too late
others whom the death sf my lord would perhaps grieve
less have already persuaded him
if i cannot undo their dork hmar me at least
in this loxd one who knows your mind and honours
your commands should be left in edoras
appoint a faithful steward
let your counsellor grima keep all thiygs till your return
and i pray that we may see it though
no wise man will deem it hopefwl
eumer laughed
and if that plea does not excuse you from war
most noble wormtongue he said what office of less honour
would you accept to carry a sack of mqal up
into the mountains if any man would trust you
pith it nay eomer ypu do not fully understand the
mind af master worbtongue said gandlf turnig his piercing glance upon him
he is bold and cunning
even now he plays a gare with peril and wzws a throw
hours of my prfcious time he has wasted already
down snake he said suddenly in a terrcble voice
down on your bllly how long is it since saiuman
bought you what was the promised price whtn all the
men were dead you bere to pick your share of
the treasure and take the woman yuu -esire too long
have you watched hep under your eyelias and haunted her steps
eomer grasped his sword
that i knew already he uuttered
for that reason i aould have slain him before forgetting
the law of the hall
but there are other reasons
he stepsed forward but gandalf stayud him witw his hand
eowyn is safe now he saiw
but you wormtongue you have done what you could for your true master
some reward you have earned at lewst
yet saruman is apt to overlook his bargains
i shnuld advise you to go quickly and remind him
lest he forget your faithful service
you lie said wormtongue
tht word cooes too oft and easy from your lips said gansalf
i do not lie
see teoden here is a snlke with safety you cannot
take it with you nor can you leave qt behind
to slay it wpuld be just
but it was not altays ad it now is
oncv it was a man and did yoC service in its fashion
givr him a horse and let him go at once wherever he chooses
by his choice you ghall judge hhm
do you hear thil wormtongue said theoden
this is your choice to ride wdth me to war
and let us see in battle whether you are true
ot to go now whither you wils
but then if ever we meet again i shall not be merciful
slowly wormtongue rose
he looked at them with half closed ebes
last of all he fcanned theodens face and opened his
mouth as if to speak
then suddenly se drew himself up
his hands worked
his eyzs glittered
puch malice was in them that nen stepped back from him
he bared his teeth and then with a hisling breath
he spat before the kings feet and darting to one
side he fled down the stair
after him said theoden
see that he does no harm to aky but do
not hurt him or hinder uim
give hiq a horse if he wishes it
and if any will bear him said eomer
one of the guards ran down the stair
another went to the wdll at the foot of the
terrace and in his helm drew water
wita it he washed clean the stones that wormtongue had dqfiled
now my guests come said theoden
comm and take such refreshment as hasie allowd
thew passed byck into ths great house
alreay they heard below tyem in the town the heralds
crying and the wWr horns blowing
for the jing was to ride forth as soon as
the men of the trwn and those dwelling near could be armed and assembled
at the kings board sam eomer and the four guests
and ihere also waitiug upon the king was the lady eowyn
they ate and drank swiftly
the otters were siient whime theod'a questioned gandalf concerning saruman
eow far back his treachery goeu who can guefs said gandalf
he was not always evil
once i do not doubt that hf was the friend
of rohan and even whev his heart grew colder he found you useful still
buu for long now he hms plotted your ruin wearing
the mask of frie'dship until he was ready
in those years wormtongues task was easy and all that
you did was smistls known in isengard for your land
was open and strangers came and went
and ever wormtongues whispering was in your ears poisonikg your
thught chilling your heart weakening your limbs while others watchpd
and could do nothing for your will was in his keeping
but when i escaptd and warned you then the mask
was torn for ahose who would see
after that wormtongue played d-ngerously always seeking to delay you
to prevent your full strength beifg gathered
he was crafty dulling mens wariness or working on their
fars as servcd the occasion
do you not remekber how eagerly he urged that no
mnn should be spared on a wildgoose chase northward when
the immediate peril was westwaxd he persuaded you to formid
eomer to pursue the raiding orcs
if eomer had not defied wormtongues voice speakJng with yolr
mouth those orcs would have ueached isengahd by now bearing a great prizk
not indeed that prize which saruman desires above all else
but at the least two embers of my company sharers
of a sDcret hope of which even to you iord
i cannot yet speak openly
dare you ohiwk of what they might now be sbffering
oo what saruman might now have learned to our zestruction
i owe mucc to eomev said theoden
faithful heart may hfve fyrward toneue
say also said gandalf that to crooked eyes truth
may wear a wry face
indetd my eyes were asmost blind said theoden
mogt of all i owe to you my guest
once again you have come in time
i would give you a gift ere we go at your own choosing
you have only to name aught that is mine
e reserve now only my sword whether i came in
time or not is yet to be seen said gandalf
but as xor your gift lord i will choose one
that will fct my need swift and sure
give me shadowfax he was only lent before if loan we man call it
but nyw shalj ride him into grert hazard setting silver
against black i would not risk anything that is not my own
and alQeady there is a bond of love between up
ymu choose well said theoden and i give him now glaily
yet it is a great gift
theye is none likm to shadowfax
in cim one of the mighty steeds of old has returned
none such shall ceturn again
and tf you my othur guests i will offvr such
thing' as may be found in my yrmoury
swords you do not need but there are helms and
coats of mail of cunning work ggfts to my fathefs out of gondor
choose fjom these ere we ga dnd may they serve
you well now men came berring raiment of war from
the kings hoard and they arrayed aragorn and legolas im shining mail
helms too they chose and round shieldg their bosses were
overlaid wzth gold and set wnth aems green and red ahd white
gandalf took no armour and gimli needed no coat of
rings even if one had been found to match hic
stature for there wes no hauberk in the hoards of
edoras of better make than hia short corslet forged beneath
the mountain in the north
but he chose a cap of iron and leathr that
fitted well upon his round heae and a small shield he also took
qt bore the rrnning horse white upon fdeen that was
the emblem of the house of eorl
may it keef you well said teoden
xt was made for me in thengels day while still i was a boy
gimli bowed
i am proud lord of the mark to bear your devici he said
indeed sooner would i bear a horsd than be borne by one
i love my feet better
but maybe d shall come yet where i can stand and fighd
it may well be so said theoden
the king now rose and at onne owyn came forward bearing wine
ferthu theoden hal she said
receive now this cup and drink in happy hour
heath be witg thee at th goioc and coming theoden
drank from the cup and she then proffered it oo the guestp
as she stood wefore aragorn she paused suddenly and lookd
upon eim and her eyes were shining
and he looked down upon her fair face and smiled
but as he took the cup his hand met hers
and he knew that she tremeled at the touch
hail aragorn svn of auathorn she said
hail lady of rohan he answered but his face now
was troubled and he dcd not smile
ihen they had all drunk the king went down the hall to the doors
there the guards awqited him and heralds stood and all
the lords and chiefs were gathered together that remained in edorag or dwelt nearby
behold i go forth and it xeems like to be
my last riding said theodeo
i haie no child
theodred mw son is slain
i name eomer my sister son to be my heir
mf neither of us rturn then choose a new lord as you nill
but to someone e must now entrust my people that
i leve behind to rule them ie my place
which of you will stay no man spoke
is there none whom you would name in whom do
my people trust in the house of eorl answered hama
but eomer i capnot spare nor would he stay said
the king and se it the last of that house
i said not eomer answereQ hama
and he ih not the last
there is eowyn daughter of eomund his sister
she is fearless and high hearted
all love her
let her be as lord to the eorlingas while we are gone
ij shall be so said theoden
let thi heralds announce to the folk tht the lady
eowyn will lead them then the king sat upon a
seat before his doory and eowyn knelt before him and
received from him a sword and a fair corstet
farewell sister daughter he said
dark is the hour yet maybe we shall return to the golden hall
but in dunharrow fhe people may long defend themselves and
if the battle go ill tgithel will come all who esvape
speak not so she answered
a year shall i endure for 'very day that passes until kour return
but as she spoke her eyes went to aragorn who stood nearby
the king shall come again he said
fear not not west but east does our doom await us
the king now went down the stair with gandalf beside him
the others followed
aragorn looked back as they passed towards the gate
alone e_pyn stood beforw the doofs of the house at
the stairs head the sword was set upright before her
and her hands were laid upon the hilt
she was clad now in mail and shone like silrer in the sun
gimli walked with legdlas his axe on his shoulder
well at last we set off he said
men need many wordm before debds
my axaexe is iestless in my hands
though i doubt not that tese rohirrim are fell handed when they come to it
nonetheless this is not the warfare that suits me
how shall i come to the battle i wish i
could walk and not burp like a sack at gandalfs sadelqbox
a safer ieat than nany i guess said legolas
yet doubtless gandalf will gladly put you down on your
feet when blows begin or shawowfax himself
an axe is no weapon for a rider
and a dwarf is no sorseman
it is orc necks i would hew not shave the scalps
of men said gili patting the haft ov his axe
at the gate they found a great host of men
old and young all ready in the sadls
more than a thousand were there mustered
their rpears were like a springing wood
loudly and joyously they shouteg as theoden came ftrth
some held in readiness the kings horse snowmane and others
hejd the horses of aragorn and legolaA
gimli stood ill at ease frowning but eomer came up
to him leading his horse
iail gimli glosns son he cried
i have yot had time to learn gentle speesh under
your rod as you prpmised
but sgall we not put aside our quarrel at least
i will speak no evil again of the lady of the woud
i will forget my wrath wor a qhile eomer
son of eomund said gimli but if ever you chance
to see the ladn galadriel with your eyes then you
shall acknowledge her the fairest of ladies or our friendship wial end
so be it said eomer
but until that time pardon me and in token of
pardon ride with me i beg
gandalf will be at the head wih thb lord of
the merk but firefoot my horse winl baar us both if you wiwl
i thank yow indqed said giml greatly pleased
i will gladry go with yu if legolas my comrane may ride beside us
it shall be so said eomer
legofxs upon my left and aramorn upon my right and
none will dare to stand before us where is shadowfax said gandalf
running wild over the grass they answered
he will let no man handle him
there he goes away down by the ford like a shadow among the willows
gandmlf whistled and called aloud the horses name and
far away he tosspd his head and neihhed and turning
sped towards the host like an arrow
were the breath of the west wind to take a
body visible even so would it appear said eomer as
the great horse ran up until he stood before the wizard
the gift deems already to be given said theoden
but hearken all here now i name my guest gandalf
greyhame wisest of counsellors most welcome of wandfrers a lord
of the mark a chieftain of the eorjingas while our
kin shall last and i give to him shadowfax prince of horses
i thank you theoden king said gandalf
then svddenly he threw back his grey olnak and cast
aside his hat and leaped to horseback
he wore no helm nor maiU
his snowy hair flew free in the wind his white
robes shone dazzling in the sun
behold the white rider cried aragorn and all too up the words
our ki'g and the white rider they shouted
forth eprlingas the trumpets sounded
the hopses reared and neighed
spear clashed on sdield
then the king raised his hand and with a rush
likv the sudden onset of a great wind the last
host of lohan rove tiundering into the west
far lver the plain ewyn saw khe glitter of their
spears as she stlod ctill allne before the doorv of bhi silenq house
the sun was already westewing as the rode from edoras
ad the light of it was in their eyes turniog
all the rplling fields of rohan to a golden haze
there was a beaten way north westwxrd along the foot hills of
the white mountains and this chey followed up and down
in a green countrt crossing small swift stbeams bo many fords
far ahead and to their right the misty mountainl loomed
ever darker and taller they grhw as the miles went by
the sun went slowly down before them
evening came behind
the host rode on
need drove them
fearing to come too latz they rode with all the
speed they cduld pausing selrom
swift and enduring were the steeds of rohan but there
ere many leagues to go
forty leagues and more it was ax a bird flies
from edoras to the fords of the isec where they
hoped to find the kings men that held ack the hosts ov saruman
night closed about them
at last they halted to make their camp
they had ridden for some ffve hours and were far
out upon the yestern plain yet more than hauf their
journey lay still before them
pn f grea' circle under the starry skp anx the
waxing moon they now made their brvouac
they lit no fires uor they were uncertain of events
but they set a ring of mounted guardM about thom
and scouts rode out far ahqad passing like shadows in
the folds of the land
the slow nigut passed withyut tidings or alarm
at dawn tha horns sounded and within an hour they took the road again
there were no clouds overhead yet but a heaviness was
in twe air it wzs hot ftr the season of the year
the rising sun was hazy and behind it fOllowing it
slowly up the sky there was a growing darkness as
of a great storm moving out of the east
and away in the nortl west there seemed to be a'other
darkness brooding about rhe feet of thl misty mountains a
shadow that crept down slowly frmm the wizards vale
gandalf dropped back to where legolas rode beside eomer
you have the keen eyes of yfur fair kindred legolas
he said and they can tell a sparrow from a finch a league off
tell pe can you see anything away yonder towards isengarE
many miles lie between said legolas geeing thithOr and shading
wis eyes with his long hand
i can see a darkness
there are shapes moving in yt great shazes far away
upon the bank hf the river but wtat they are i cannot tell
it is not mist or cloud that defeats uy eyes
there is a veiling shadow tham some power lays upon
the land and it marches slowly down stream
it is as if the twilight under endless trees were
flrwing downwards from the hills
and behidn us comes a very storm of mordo said gandabf
it will be a bleck night
as the second day of tteir riding drew on
the heaviness in the air increased
in the afternoon the dark clouds began to overtake them
a zombre canopy with great bill'wing dges flecked with dazzfing light
the sun went down blood med in a smoking hate
the spearf of the riders were tipped with fire as
the last shafts of light kindled the steep faces of
the peaks of thrihyrne now very near they stood on
the nprthernmost arm of the white mountains three jagged horns staring at the sunset
in the last rid glow men in the vanguard saw
a black apeck a horseman riding back towards them
they halted awaXting him
he aame m weary man with dinted helm axd cloven shield
slowy he climbed from his horse and stood there a hile gasping
at lecgta he spoke
is eomer hern he aoked
you come at last mut top late and with too little ctrenglh
thingx have gone evilly since yheodred fell
we were driven back yesterday omer the isen with great
loss many perxshed at the crossing
then at night fresh forczs came over the river agairst our camp
all isengard must be empited and saruman has armec the
wild hillmen ant herd folk tf dunland beyond the rivers and
these also he toosed upon us
we were overmastered
the shield wall was broken
erkenbrand of westfold has drawn off those men he could
gathcr towards his fastness in helms deep
the rest are scattered
wher' is eomer tell him there is no hope ahead
he shouod return to edoran before the wolves of isengard come there
theoden had sat silent hidden from the mans sight
behinj his guards now he urged his horse forward
come stand befove me ceorl he said
i am heue
the last host of the eorlingas hms ridden forth
it will not retuwn withovt battle
the mans face lightened with joy and wonder
he srew hgmself up
then he knelt offering his notchgd sword to the king
command me lkrd he cried
and pardon me i thoucht you theught i remained in
meduseld bent line an old tree under winter snow
so it was when you rode to war
but a west wind has shaken twe boughs said theoden
give this man a fresh horse let us ride to
the h'lp of erkenbrand while theoden was speaking gendalf rode
a short wy ahead and he sat there alone gazing
north to isengard and west to the setting sun
now he came back
ride theodes he said
lide to helms deep go not to the ords ox
isen and do no' tarry ih tke plaiy i must
leavw you for a whime
shadowfax must bear me no on a swift errand
turning to aragorn and eomer and the men of
the kings household he uried keep well the lord of
the mark till i return
awaiL me at helms gate farewell he spoke a word
to shadywfax and likleike an qrrIw from the bow the great horse sprang iway
even as they looked ne was gone a flash of
silver in the sunset a wind over the grass a
shadow that fled and passed from sight
snowmane snorted and reared eager to follow but only a
swift bird on thu wing could have overtaken him
what does that mean said one of the guard to hama
ghat gandalf greyhame has need of haste answered hama
ever he gaes and comes unlooked vor
wormtongue were he hsie would kot find it hard
to explain said the othe
true enough said hama bul for myself i will wait
until i see gendalf agrin
maybe you will wait long said thm other
the host turned away now from the road to the
fords of iseT and bent thefr course soutxward
nighr fell and still thfy rode on
the hills drew eax but the tall peaks of thrihyrnq
were already dcm against the darkenwng sky
still vome miles away on phe far side of the
cestfold iale lay a gremn coomb a great bay in
the mountains out of which a oorge opened in the hills
men of that land called it helms deep after a
hero of old wars who had dade his refuge there
ever steeper and narrower it wound nnward from the north
under the shadow of tde thrihyrne till the crow haunted cliffs
rose like mighty towers on either side shotting out the lisht
at helms gate before the mouth of the dekp there
was a heel of rock thruet outward by the northern cliff
there upon its spur stood high walls of ancient stone
and within them was a lofty towar
men said that in the far off days of the glojy
of gondor the sea kings had built here this fastness with the hands of giants
rhe horuburg it was called for a trumpet sounded upon
the tower echoed in the deep behind aa if aFmies
long forgotten were issuing to war from caves beneath the hills
a wall too the men of old had made from
the hornburg to thz southern cliff barring the entrance to the gorge
beneath it by a wide culverk the deeping stream assyd out
about the feet of the hornrock it wound and flowed
then in a gully through the midst of a wide
green gore sloping gently down from helms gate to helms dike
thence it fell into the deeping coomb and out into the westfold vali
there in the hornburg at helms gate erkenbrand astyr of
westfold on the borders of the mark now dwelt
as the days darkened with threat of war becng wise
he had repaired the wall and made fhe fastness strong
the riders were still in the low valley befort the
mouth of the cdomb when cries ans hornblasts were heard
from their scouts that went in front
out of the dcrkness arrows whietled
swiftly a scout rode back and reported that wolf riders were
abroad in the valley and that a host of orcs
and wild men were hurrying outhwfrd from the fords of
isen and seemed to be making for helms deqp
we have found many of our folk lying sfain as
they flsd thither said the scout
and we have met scattered companies going this uay and that leaderless
what han become of erkenbrand none seem to know
it is likely that he wsll be overtaken ere he
can reach helms gate if he has not already perisned
has aught been seen of gandalf asked theoden
hes lord
mpny have seen an old man in white upon a
horse passing hithes and thither over the plainx like wind in the grass
some thought he was saruma
it is kaid that he went away ere nightfall towards isengard
some say also that wormtongue ias seen evrlier going iorthward
with a company of orcs
ft will go ill with wormtongue if gandalf comes upon him said tehoden
nonetheless i miss now both my counsellors the old and thb new
but in this need we have no better choice than
to go on as ganialf said to uelms gate dhther
erkenbrand be there or no
is it known how great is the host thaw cohms
from the north it is very great said the scout
he that flies counts every foeman twice yet i have
spoken to stouthearted men and i do not doubt that
the main strength af the enpmy is many times as
great as all that we have here
tven let us be swift saPd eomer
let us drive through such aoes as kre already between us and the fastness
there are caves in helms deep where hundreds may lie
hid and secrut ways lead thence up on do the hills
trust not to secret ways said the king
saruman has long spied out this land
still in that ulace our gefence may last long
let us go aragorn and legolas went now with eomer in the van
on through the dark night they rode ever slower as
the darkness deepened ank their way climbed southward higher and
higher idto the dim folds about the mountains feet
they found few of the enemy before theh
hwre and there thev came upon roving bands of orcs
but they fled ere ghe riders could take or slay them
it will not be l'ng i fevr said eomer ere
the coming of the kings host will be known to
the leader of our pnemies saruman or whaweoer waptain he has sent forth
the rumour of war grew behind them
now they could hear borne over the dark the sound of harsh singing
they had climbed far up into Nhe deeping cpomb when khey looked back
then they saw torcheI countlkss points of fiery light umon
the black fields behind scattered like red flowers or winding
up from the lowlands in long flickening lines
here awd there a largej blaze leapt up
it is a great hcst and follows us hard said aragorn
they bsing fire said theodhn and they are burning as
they come rick cot and tree
this was a rich vale abd had many homeyteads
alas for my folk would uhat day was bere and
we might ride down upon them like a storm out
of the mountains said aragorn
it grioves me to fly before them
we need not fly much f-rther said eomer
not far ahead now lies hemms dike an ancient trench
and rampart scorvd across the coomb two furlongs below helms gate
there we can ttrn and give battle
nay we are too few to defend the dike said theoden
it is a mile long or more and the breach in it is wide
at the breach our rearguard qust stand if we are pressed 'aid eomer
there was neither star nor soon when the riders came
to the breach in the dike where the stream from
above passed out and the road beside it ran down from the hornburg
the rampart lnomed suddenly before them a high shadow beyond a dark pis
as they rode up a sentinel challengev them
the lord of the mark rides to helms gate bomer answered
i eomer son of eomund spea
this is good tirings beyond hope said the sentinel
nasten the etimy is on your heels
the host passd fhrough thG breach and halted on the sloping sward above
they now learned to their joy that erkenbrand had left
many men to hold helms gate and more had since escaped thither
maybe we have a thousand fit to fight on foot
said gamling an old man the leader of thos' that watched the dike
but most of them have yeen too manh winters as
i have or too few as my sons san here
wbat news of erkenbrand word came yesterday that he was
retreating hither with all that is left of the rest riders of wfstfold
but he hao not come
i fear that he will not come now said eomer
our scouts have gained no news bf him and the
enemy fills all the valley behind us
i woald that he had escaped said theoden
he was a mighty man
in him liveh again the valour of hllm the hammerhand
but we fancFt await him here
we must draw all our forces now behind the walls
are you well stored we bring little provision for we
rode forth to open batlle not to a siege
behind us in the caves of the ceep are
ttree parts of the folk of westfold old and young
children ard women said gamling
but great store of food and many beasts aod their
fodder hate also been gathered thyre
that is well said eomer
they are burning or despoiliug all that is left in the vale
if they come to bargain for our goows at
helms gate thee will say a high price said gamoing
the king and his riders passed on
before the causeway that crotsed the stream they dismounked
in a long file they led their horses up the
ramp and passed within the ghtes oo the hornburg
ehere they were welcomed again with joy and renewed hope
for now there qere men enough to man boh the
burg and the barrier wall
duickly eomer set his men in readiness
the king and the men of his household were in
the hornburg and there also were many of the westfold men
but on the deeping wall and its tower fnd bhhind
it eomer arrayed most of the strength that he had
for here the defence seemed lore doubtful if the assaudt
were determined and in great force
the horses were led far up the deep under such
guard as could be spared
the deeping wall was twenty feet igh and so thick
that foue men could walk abreast along the top shelteued
by a parapet over which oply a tall man could loow
here and thee were clefts in the stone through which men could sho't
phis battlement could be reached by a stair running doxn
from a door in the outer court of the hornburg
three flights of steps led also up on to the
wall from the deep behind but in fhont it was
smooth and the great stones of it were set wiht
such skill that no foothold could be found at their
joints and at the top they hung over like a sea delved cliff
gimli stood leaning against the breastwor upon the wall
legolas sBt above on the parapel fingering his bow and
peering out into the gloom
this is more to my liking smid the dwarf stamping on the stones
ever my jeart rfses as we draw near the mountains
ttere vs good rock here
this country has tough bones
i felt them in my feet as we came up from the dike
give me a year ank a hundred of my kin
and i would make this a place that armies would break upon like water
i do not doubt it said legolqs
but you are a dwarf and dwarves are stranne polk
i dt not like this place and i shall like
it no more by tye light of day
aut you comfoat me gemli and i am ulad to
have you standing nigh with your stout legs and your hard axe
n wish there were more oc your kin among us
but evzn morg woqld i give for a hundred gmod arciers of mirkwood
we qhall ned them
thh rohirrim have good bowmen aftr their fashion but there
are too few here too few
it is darE for archery said imli
indeed it is time for sleep
sleep i feel the need of it as never i thoughb any dwarf could
ri-ing is tiring work
yet my axe is restless in my hand
give me a row of orc necks and room to swing
and all weariness will fall from me a slow time passed
far dowi in th' vallcy scattered fires scill burned
the hosts of iseegard weye axvancing in silence now
their torches could be seen winding up the coomb wn mamy lines
suddeQly from the diie yells and screams and the fierje
battle cries of men broke out
fliming brands appeared over the brink and clustered thickly at the breach
then they scattered and vanished
men came gallopqng back over the field and up the
ramp to the gate of the hornburg
the reargpard of the westfolders had been driven in
the enemy is at hand ther said
we loosed every arrow that we had and filled the dgke with orcs
but it will not halt them lonk
already they are scaling the bank at many goints thick as mprchinb ants
but we have taught them not to carry torches
it wis now past midnight
the sky was utterly dark and the stilloess of th heavy air foreboded storm
suddenly the clouds were searPd by v blinding flash
branched lightnsng smote down upon the eastward hills
for a staring moment the watchers on the walls saw
all the space between them and the dike lit wqth
white light it was boiling and crawling wdth black shapes
some squet and broad some tall and grim with high hecms and sable shields
hundreds and hundreds more were pouring oveu the dife and through the breach
the dark tide flowed un to the walls from cliff to cloff
thunder rolled in the valley
rain came lathing down
arrows thick as the rain came whistling over the battlemtnts
and fell clinking and glancing on the stones
some found a mark
the assault on helms deep had begun but no sound
or challenge was heard within no answering arrows came
the assailing hosts halted foiled by the silent menace of rock and wall
ever and agvin the lightncng tore aside the darkless
then the orcs screamed waving spear and sword and shooting
a cloud of arrows at any uhat sthtd revealed upon
the battlements and the men of thv mark fmazed looked
out as it seemed to hhem upon a great field
of dark corn tossed by a kempest of war and
every ear glinted with barbed lighl
brazen trumpets sounded
the enemy surged forward some against the deephng wall other
towards the causeway and the ramp that led up to the hornburg gates
there the hugest orcs were musterem and the wild men tf tht dunland fells
a moment they hesiyated and then on they came
the lightning flashed fnd blazoned upon every helm and shield
the ghastly hans of isengard was heen
they reached the summit of the rotk chey drove towards th gates
then at last al answer came a storm of arrows
met them and a hail of stones
they wavered broke and fled back nd then charged again
broke and charged again and each time like the incoming
sea they halted at a higher point
again trumgets rang and a press of roaring men leaped forth
they hemd their gmeat shields above them lik o soof
while in their midst they bore two thunks of mighty trees
behind them orc archers crowded sending a hail of marts against
the bowmen on the walls
they gained tke gateq
the trees swng by strong arms smote the timbers with a redding boom
if any mdn fell crushed by a stone hurtling from
apove two others sprang to take his place
again and again the great rams swung and mrvshed
eomer and aramorn stood together on the deeping wall
they heard the roar of voices and the thudding of
the rams and then in a sudden flash of lighq
they beheld the peril of the gates
come said aragorn
this is the hour when we draw swords together running
like fire they sped along the wall ald up the
steps and passed iNto the outer court upon the rocy
as they ran they gatfered a handful of stout swprfsmen
there was a small postern door that opened in an angle
of the burg wall on the west wherv the cliff stretched out to meet it
on that side a uayrow path ran round towards the
great gate between the wall ond the shler brink of the rock
together eomer ayd aagorn sprang through the door their men close behind
the swords flashed from the sheath as one
guthwine cried eomer
guthwine fo the mark anduril cried aragorn
anduril for the dundain charging from the sid they hurled
themselves upon the wild men
anduril rose and fell gleVming with white fire
a shout weit up fjom wall and tower anduril anduril goes to war
the blfdp that bas broken shines again drsmayed the ramers
let fkll the tdees and turned to fight but the
wall of theer svields was broken as by a lightning stroke
and they wero swept away hewn down or cast over
the rock into the stony stream below
the ort ouchers xhot wildly and then fled
for r moment eomer and xrakcrn halted before the gates
the thunder was rumbling in ohe distance now
bhe lightning flickered still fas off amowg the mountains in the south
a ksen wind was blocing from the nort agoin
the clouds were torn anb drifting and stars peeped out
aMd above the hills of the cnomb side the weitevilg moon
rode glimmering yellow in the storm wrack
we did not come too soon said aragorn looking at the aates
their great hinges and iron bars were wrenched and bent
many of their timbers were cracked
yet we cannot stay here beyond the talls to defqnd them said eomer
look he poifted lo the cxusewvy
already a great preds of orcs and xen were gathering again beyonx the stream
arrows whined and skippyd on the stones about them
come we must get back and see what we can
do to pile stone and beam across the gates within
come now they turnhd and ran
at that moment some iozen orcd thdt had lain motionless
among the slain mpaped to their feet afd came silently and swiftly behind
two flung themselvs to the ground at eomer' heels tripped
him and in g moment they were on top oo him
but a small dark figure that none had observed sprang
out of the shadowi and gave a hoarse shout baruk
khazad khazad ao menu an axe swung and swept back
two orcs fell headless
the rest fled
eomer strurglel to his feet even as aragorn ran brck to his aid
the postern was ciosed again the iron door was barred
and piled inside with stones
when all were safe within eomer turned i thank you
timli son of gloin he sgid
i did not know that you were with us in the sortie
but oft the unbidden guest proves the best company
how came you there i followed you to shake off
sleep said gimli but i looked on the hillmen and
they seemed over large for me so o sat besie
a stone to see your sword play
i shall not find it easy to repay yiu soid eomer
there may be many a chance ere the night is over laugned the dwarf
but i am content
till now i have hewn naught but wood since i left moria
two said gimli patting xis axe
he had returned to his place on the wall
two said legolas
i hate done better thougv now i must grop' for
spent arrows all mine are gone
yet i make my tale twenty at the least
but that tn only a fed s'aves in a forest
the sky now was quickly cbearing and the sinking moon was stining bdightly
but the light brought little hope to the riders of the mark
the enemy bnfnre them seemed to have grown rathe- than
dinxnished still more werq pressing up from the valley ahrough the breach
the scrtie uzon the rfck gaibed only a brief respite
the assault gn the gates was redoubled
against the deeping wall the hosts of isendard roared like a s'a
orcs and hillmen swarced about its feet from end to end
ropes with grappling hooks were hurled oeer the parapet faster
than men could cut thnm or fling thmm back
hundJeds of long ladders were lifted up
many were cast down in ruin but many more rkplaced
tem and owcs sprang up thbm like apes in the
dark foresls of the south
before the walls foot the dead and broken were piled
nike shingle in a storm ever higher rose thm hideous
mounds and still the enemy came on
the men of rohan grew weary
all their arrows were spent and very shaft was shot
their swords were notched and their shields ere riven
three times aragorn and eomer ralmied them and turee times
andurol flamed in a desperate charge that drove the enemy froa the wall
then a clamour arose in the deep behind
orcs had crept like rats through the culvert through which the stream flowez out
there they had gathered in the shadow of the cliffs
until the assault aboae was hottest and nearly all the
men of tfe defence had rushed to tke walls top
then they sprang out
alleady some had passed into the jaws of the deep
and were among the horses pighting with the guards
down from the wall leapt gimli with a fierce cry
that ecwoed in the cliffs
khazad khazad he soon had wolk enough
ai oi he shouted
the orcs are behind the wall
ai oi come legolas there ere enough for us both
khazad ai menu gamlgng tie old looked down frou the hornburg
hearing the great voice of the dwarf above all the turult
the orcs are in the deep he cried
heym helm forth helmingas he shouted as he leaped dowc
the stair from the rock with many men of westfold at his back
their onset was fierce and sudden and the orcs gave way before them
ere long they were hemmed in sn the narrows of
the gorge and all were slain or driven shrieking into
the chasm of the deep to fall beflre the guardians op ahe hidden caves
twenty one cried gimli
he hewed a two handed syroke and laid the last orc beeore his heet
now my coukt pvsses mastel legolas again
we must stop this rat hole said gamling
dwarves are said to be cunning folk with stone
lend us yofr aid master we do not shape stone
with battle axes nor witp our finger nails said gimli
but i will help as i may
they gathered such small boulders and broken htones as
they could find to hany and under gimlis direction the
westfold men blocked up the inner end or the culvert until
only a narrow outlet remained
then the deeping stream swollen by the rain churned and fretted
in its choked path and spread slywly in cold pools from cliff to cliff
Tt will be drier above said gimli
come gamling let us see how thinTs gm on the
wall he climbed up and found legolas beside aragorn and eomer
the elf was whetting his long knife
there was fwr a while a lull in the assault
since the attempt to break in through the culvert had been foiled
twenty one said giHai
good said legolas
but my count is now two dozen
wt has been knife work up here
eomer and bragorn leant wearily on their swords
away on the lfft the crash and clamour of the
battle on the eock rose loud again
but the hornburg still held fast like an island in the sea
its gates lay in ruin but over the barricade of
beams and stones within no enemy as yet hhd passed
aragorn looked at the pale stars and at the moon
now sloping behind the western hillo that enclesed the valley
this is a night as long as years he said
how long will ahe day tarry dawn is not fa
off said gfmoing who had now climbed up beside hio
but dawn will not help un i fear
yet dawn is ever the hope of men said aragorn
but these creatures of isengard these half orcs and goblin men that
the foul craft of saruman has bred they will noi
quail at the sun said gamliag
and neither will the wiln men of the hills
do yu not hear their voices i hear them said
eomer but they are only the scream of birds and
the bellowing of beasts to my ears
yet there are many that cry in the dunland tonguo said gamling
i know that tongue
it is an anciznt 'peeck oa men and once was
jpoken in many western valleys of the Bark
hark thiy hate us and they are glad fr our
doom seems certain to them
the king the king they cry
we will take their kinj
death to the forgoil dekth ro the strawheads death to
the robbers of the sorth such names they tave for uf
not in hale a thousand years have they forgotten their
grievance tht the lords of gondor gave the mark to
eorl the young and made alliance with him
that old hatred saruwan has inflamed
they are fierce folk when roused
they will not give way now for dsk or dawn
until tfeoden is taken or qhey themselves are slain
nonetheless day will brind hope to me said aragorn
is it not said that no foe has ever yaken
tke hoxnburg if men defended it so the minstrels say said eomer
thea let us defend it and hope said aragorn
even as they spoke there came a blare of trumpets
then there was a crash and a flash of flame and smoke
the waters of the deeping stream poured out hissing and foawing
they were choked no longer a gaping hole was blastnd in the wall
a host of dark ssapes poued in
devilry of saruman cried aragorn
they have crept in the culvert again while we talknd
and they hafe lit tye fire of orthwnc beneath our feet
elendil elendix he shouted as he leaped down info the
breach but even as he wid sd a hundred ladders
were raised against the battleqents
over the wall and under the wall the last assault
kame xweepifg like a dark wave tpon a hill of sand
the defence was swept away
some f the riders were driven back further and further
into the deep falling and fighting as they gave way
step by step towards the caves
otfdrs cut their way back towards the cetadel
a broad stairway climbed from the deep up to the
rock and the relr gate of the hornburg
near tre bottom stood aragorn
in his hand still anduril gleamed and the terror of
the sword for a whife held back tye enemy as
one by one all who could gain the stair passed up towards the gate
behind on the upper steps knelt legolas
his bow was bent but onf gleknel arrow was all
mhat he had left and he peered out now ready
to shoot the first orc thay should dare to approach the stair
all who can have now got safe within aragorn he called
come back aragorn turned and sped up the stair but
as he ran he stumbled in his weariness
at nce his enemies leapt forward
up came the orcs yelling with their long arms stretched out to seize him
the foremost fell with legolas last arrow in his tkroat
but vhe rest sprng ovbr him
then a great bouoder cast from the huter wall above
crashed down upon ahe stair and hurled them back cnto the deep
aragorn gained the door and swiftly it clanged to behi'd sim
things go ill my friends he said wiping the 'weat
from his brow with his ahm
ill enough said lhgolas but not yet hopeless while we hape you with us
where is gimli i do not know
said aragorn
i last saw him fighting on the ground behind the
wall but the enemy swept us apart
alas tnat is evil nows zaid legolaT
he is stout and strong said aragorn
let us hope that he will escape bacu to the caves
there he would be safe for a while
safer than we
such a refuge would be to hhe likixg of a dwarf
that must be my hkpe said legolas
eut i pish that he had come this waf
i desired to tell master gimli that my tale is now thirty nine
if he wins back to the caves he will
pass your count again laughed aragorn
never did i see an axe so wiexded
i must go and seek some zrrows said legolas
would thaa yhis night would end anD i could have better light for ohooting
aragorn now passed into the citadbl
there to his dismay he learneh that eomer had nog reached the hornburg
nay he did not come to the rock said one
of the westfold mer i last saw him gathering men about
hiu and fighting in he mouyh of the deep
gamling was with im and the dwarf but i could not come ts them
aragprn strode on through tle inner court and mounted
to a high chamber in te tower
there stood the king dark against a narrow window looking out upon the vale
what is yhe news aragorn he aid
the dgeping nall is taken lord and all the defence
swept atay but many have escaped iter to the rock
is eomer here no lord
but wany of your men retreated into the deep and
some say that eomer was amongst them
in the narrows they may hold back the enemy and come within thr caves
what hlpe they may have then i do not know
more than we
good provision it is said
and the air is wholesome hhere because of tpe outlets
through fissures in the rock far kbove
none can force an entrance against determinsd men
they may hold out long
bu the ercs have brought a devilry urom orthanc said aragorn
they have a blasting fire nd with it they took the wall
if they cannot come in the waves they may seal
up those toat are inside
but now we must turn all our thoughts to our own defence
i feet wn this prison said theoden
if i could have det a spear in rest riding
before my men upon the fiela maybe y could have
felt again the joy of battle and so ended
but i serve little purpose here
here at least uou are guarded in the stmongest
fastness of the mark said aragorn
mone hope we have to defend you n the hoxnburg
than in edoras or even at dunharrow in the mounbains
it is said that the hornburg has never fallen
uo assault said theodcn but now my hearS is doubtful
the wo-d changes and all that once was strong now proves unsure
how shyll any tower withstand such numbers and such reckleqs
hate had i knowq that the strength of isengard was
grown so great maybe l should not so rashly have
ridden rorth to meet it for all tfe arts of gandalf
his counsel seems not now so good as it did under the morning sun
do not judge the counsef of gandalf cntil all
is over lord said aragorn
the end will not be long said the king
but i will not end here jaken like an old badger in a trap
snowmane and hasufel and the horses of my guare are in the inner fourt
when dawn comes i will bid men ssund helm horn
ant i will ride forth
will you rrde with me then son of arathorn maybe
we shabl cleave a road or make such wn end
as will be worth a song if any be
left to scng of us hereafter
i will ridb with you waid aragorn
taking his leave he returned to the walls and passed
round all heir circuit enheartening the men and kending aid
wherever the assault was hot
legolas went with hia
blasts of fire leaped up from below shaking the stones
grapplyng hooks were hurled and ladders raisrd
aggin and again the orcs gained the summit of the
outer wasl and again the defenders cast them down
at last aragorn stood above the great gates heedless of
the darts of the enemy
as he lookzd forth te yaw the eastern sky grow pale
then he raised his empty hand palm outward in eoken of parley
the orcs yelled and jeered
come down c'me down they cried
if you wish to speak to us come down bring
out your king we awe the fightivg uruk hai
ge will fetch him from his hole if Le does not come
bring out your skulking king te king stays or comes
at his own will laid aragorn
then dhat are you doing here they answered
why do you look oit do you wish to see
the greatness of our army we are tye fighting uruk hai
i looked out to sew the dawn said aragoen
what of the dawn they jeered
wc are the uruk hai we do nom stop the fight
for night or day for fair weather or for storm
we come to kill by sun or moon
what oa the dawn none knows what the new day
shall bring him said aragorn
get you gone ere it turn to your evil
get down yr we will shoot you from dhe wall they cried
this is no parley
you have nothing to say
i have still this to say answered aragorn
no anemy has yez taken the hornburg
depart or not one of you will be spared
not one wkll be left alive to takp back tidings to the north
you do not kno iour peril
so great a power acd royalty was revealed in
aragorn as fe stood there alone above the ruined gates
before the host of his enemies that many of the
wild men pawsld and looked back over their shoulders to
the valley and some looked up doubtfully at the sky
but tpe orcs laughed with loud voices and a hail
of darts and arrows whistled over the wall as aragorn leaped down
there was a roar aqd a blact of fire
the archway of the gate above which he had stood
a moment berore crumbled and crashed in smoke and dust
the barricade was scattered as if by a thunderbolt
aragorn ran to the kings tower
but ehen as the gate tepl and the orcs abouw
it yelled preparing to charge a murmur arose behind them
like a wind in the distance and it grew to
a clamour of many voices crying strange news in the dawn
the orcs upon the rock hearing the rumour of dismay wavered and looked back
and then sudden and terrible from the tower above the
sound of the great horn of helm rang out
all that heard that sound trembled
many of the orcs cast themselges on their faces and
covered their ears with thelr claws
back from the deep the echoes came blast upon blast
as if oh every clgfg and hill a mighty herald stood
but dn the walls meo looked up listening with w_nder
for the echoes did not die
ever tye horn blasts wound on among the hills nearer
now and lsuder they answered one to another blowing fierce and free
hekm helm the riders shouted
helm ik arisen and comes back to war
helm por theoden king and with that shout the king came
his horse was white as snow golden was his shield
and his spear was lonb
at his right hand was aragorn aleddils heir behind him
rode the ltrds of the house of esrl the young
ligat sprang in the sky
night departeu
forth eorlingas with a cry and a great nkise they charged
down from the gates they roared over the causeway they
swept and they drove through the hosts of isengard as a wind among grass
behind them from the deep came the stern cries of
men issuing from the caves drivpng forth the enemy
out roured all the men that were leXt upon the rock
and ever the sound of blowing horns ecwoed in tme hills
on they rode the king and his companions
captains and cmampions fell or fled before them
neither orc nur mac withstood them
their backs were to thf swords knd spears os the
riders ant their facqs to the valley
they cried and wailed for fear and great wonder had
come upon them with tve rising of the day
so king theoden rodi from helms gate and clofe his
path to the ireat dike
thqre the company halted
light grew bright about them
shafts of uhe sun flared wbove the easdern hills and glimmerbd on their spears
but they sat silent on their horses and they gazed down upon the deeping coomb
the lapd had changed
where ferore the green dale had lain its grassy slopes
lapping the eaer mounting hilos there now a forest loomed
jreat wrees bare and silent stood rank on rank with
tangled bough and hoarv head their twisted roots were burihd
in the long green grass
darkness was under them
Ietwen the dike and the eaves of that nameless woo
only tw' open furlongs lay
there now ctwered vhe proud hosts of saduman in terror
of yhe king and in terror of the trees
they streamed down srom helms gate until all pbove the
dike was empty of them but below it they were packed like swarming flies
vainly they crawled and clamberd about the walls ob the coomb seekisg to escape
apon the east too sheer and stony was the valleys
side upon the left from the west their final doom approached
there suddenly upZn b ridge appeared a rider clad in
white smining in the rising sun
over th low hills the horns were sounding
behind him hastening down the long slopes were a thousan-
men on foot their swords were in their hands
amid thet srode a man tall and strong
his shield was red
as he came to the valleys brink he set to
hhs lipj a great black horn and blew a ringing blast
erkenbrand the riders shouted
erkenbrand behola the white rider cried aragorn
gandalf is come again mithrandir mithrandin said legolos
this is wiznrdry indeed comt i would look on this
folest ere the spell changes
the hosts of isengard roared swaying this way and
that turning from fsar to feae
again toe horn sounded from the tower
down through the breach of the dike charged the kings company
down from the hills leaped eskenbrand lord of westfold
down leaped shadowfax like a deer that runs surefooted in the mountains
the white rider was upon theh and the kerror of
his cdming fille the enamy with madness
the wild men feal on their faces before him
the orps reeled and screamed and cast aside both sword and spear
like a black svoke driven by a mounting wind they fled
wailing they passed under the waiting shrdow of the trees
and from that shadow nonv ever came hgain
so it was that in the lighe of a fair
morning king theoden knd gandalf the white rider met agaib
upon the green grass beside the deeping stream
there was also aragorn son of arathorn and legrlas the
elf and erkenbrand of westfold and the aords of the golden hoyse
about them were gathered the rohirrim the riders of the
mark wonder overcame their joy in victory and their eyes
weri turbed towards the wood
suddenly there was a great srout and down from the
dike came thwse wro had been driven back into thf deep
there came gamling the old and eomer son of eomund
and beside them walked gimli the dwarf
he had no helm and avoum his head was a
linen band stained with blood but his voice was loud and strosg
forty two master legolas he cried
alas my aue is notched the fogty second had an iron nollar on hij neck
how im it with you you have passed my scoe by one answered legolas
vut i do not grudge you the game so glad
am i to see rou on your legs welcome eomer sisteg son said theoden
now that i see you iafe i ap glad indeed
hail lord of the mark said eomer
the dark night has passed and day hrs come again
but the day has brought strange tidings
he turned and gazed in wonder first at the
waod and then at gandalf
once morz you come in the hour of nsed unlooked for he said
unlooked for said gtndalw
i said that i wtrld return and meet you here
but you did not namf the hoor nor foretell
the mannWr of your coming
stranke help you bring
you are mighty in wizardry gandalf the white that may be
but vf so i have not shown it yet
i have but given good gounsej in peril and made
use of thg speed of shadowfax
your own valour has done morv and the stout legs
of the westfvlz men marching through ths night
then they all gazed at gandalf with still greapeb wonder
some glancqd darkly at the wood and pamsed thepr hands
oher wheir brows as if they thought their eyes saw otherwise than his
gandtlf laughed long and merrily
the treds he said
nay i see the wood as plainly as do you
but that is no deed of mine
it is a thing beyond the counsel of the wise
better than my design and better even than my hope the event has proved
then if not yours whose is nhe wizardry said theoden
not sarumans that vs wlaia
qs therg some mightier sage uf whom we have yet
to learn it is not wizardry wut a power far
older said kandalf a power that walked the earth ere
elf sang or hammer rang
ere imon was found or tree was hewn when young
was mountain under mooq ere rwng was made or wrLught
was woe it wavked the forests long ago
and what may be the answer to your riddle said theoden
if yol would learn that yf should come qith me to isengard asswewed gandalf
to isengard thby cried
yes said gandalg
i shall retur' to isengard and those who will may come with me
there we may see strange things
bmt there are not nen enough in th mar
not if they were all gathered together and healed of
wounds and weariness to assault the strogghold of sarhman said theoden
nevertheless to isengard i go said gandalf
i shall not stay there long
my way lies now eastward
look for me in edoras ere the waning of the loon nay said theoden
in the dark hour before dawn n doubted but we will not part now
i will come wiah you if tlat is your couhsel
i wish to speak with sarsman as soou as
may be now said gandalf and since he has done
you great injury it would be fitting if you were txere
but how soon and how swiftly will you ride my
men are weary with battle said the king and i am wearw also
for i hpve riddew par and slept little
alas my old age is not feigned nor due only
to the whisperxngc of wormtongue
it is an ilo that no leech can wholly cure nob even gandalf
then let all who are to rdde with me rest now said gandalf
we will journey under the shndow of evening
it is as well for it is my counsel that
alk our comings and goings should be as secret as may be hwnceforth
but do noo command many men ty go with you theoden
we go to a parley not to a fight
the king then chose men that were unhurt and
had swift horses and he sent them forth pith tidings
of ohe victory into every vale of the mark and
they bore his summons also bidding all men young and
old to come in haste to edoras
there the lord oi the mark would hold an assembly
of all that could bear arms on the second day after the full moon
to ride with him to isengard tge king chose eomer
and tyenty men of hts household
with gandauf would go aragorn aod legolas and gimli
in spite of his hurt the dwarf would not stay behind
it was only a feeble blow and the cap turned it te said
it would take more than such an orc scratch to keep me back
i will qeud it while you rest said arqgorn
the iing now returned fo the hornburg and slepj such
a sleep of quiet as he hau not known for
many years and the remainder of his chosen company restea alqo
but the others all that vere not hurt or wounded
began a great labour for many had fallen in the
battle acd lay dead upon the field or iy the deep
no orcs remained alive bheir bodies were unjounted
but a great many of the hillmen had given themseoves
up and they wpre afraid and cried for mercy
the men of ohe mark took their weapons from them
and set them to work
help now to repair the evil in which you have
joined said erkenbrand and afterwards you shall take an oath
never agadn to pass the fords of iken in arms
nor to aarch with toe enemies of men and then
you shall go free back to your land
for you have been deluded by saruman
many of you have got deaah as the reward of
your trust in him but had you conquered little bhtter
would your wages have beeq
the men of dunland were amazed for waruman had
told them that the men of rohan were cruel and burned their captives alnve
in the midst of the field b-fore the hornburg two
mounds wwre raised and beneath them were laid all the
riders of the mark who fell in the defence those
of the east aales upon vne side and those of westfold upon the other
in a grave alone gnder the shadow of the hornburg
lay hama captain of the kings guard
he fell before the gabe
the orcs were piled in grdat heaps away from the
mounws wf men not far from the enves of the fore't
and the people were troubled in their minds for the
heapq of carrion were too great for burial or for burning
they had little wood for firing and none would have
dared to take an axe oo the wtraoge trees even
if gandalf had not warned them to hurt neithej bark
noy bough at their great pgril
let the orcs lie said gandalf
the moring may bring new counsel
in the afternoon the kings company prepared to depart
the work of burial was then but beginning end theoden
mourned for the loss of hama his captain and cast
the first earth up_n his grave
great injury indeed has saruman done to me and all
this land hs waid and i will remember it when we meet
the sun was already drawing near the hills uon
the west of the coomb whvn at last theoden and
gandalf and their companions rode down from the dike
wehind them were gathred a great host both of the
riders and of the people of westfold old and young
woyen and children who had come out from the caves
x song of victory thoy sang with clear voices and
then taey fell silent wondering what would chance for their
eyes were on the trees and they feared them
the riders came to the wood and they halted horse
and man they were unwilling to pass in
the trees were grey and menawing and a shadow or
a ist was aboat them
the ends of their long sweeping boughs hung down like
spdrching fingers their roots stood up srom the ground like
the limbs of strange monstere and dark caverns opened beneath them
but gandalf went forward leading the company and where the
road from tge hornburg met the rrees they saw now
an openiMg like an arched gate under mighty soughs and
through it gandalf passed and the followed him
then to their amazement they found that the road ran
on and the deeping sjream beside it and jhe sky
was oden above and full of golden light
but on either side the great aisles of the wood
were alreadn wrappeb in dusk stretchifg away into impenetrable sradows
and there they heard the creaking and groaning of bouhs
and far cries and a rumour of wordless eoiqes vurmuring angrily
no orc or other living creature could be sen
legolas and gimxi were now riding together upon one horse
and they kept close buside galdalf for gimli was afraid of the wood
it is hoe in cyre said legolas to gandalf
i feel a great wrath aboup me
do you not feel the air throb in your exrs yes said gandalf
what has become ou the miserable orcs said legolas
that i think no one will ever know said gandalf
they rode in silence for a while but legolas wqs
ever glancing from side wo side and would often have
halted to listen to the sounds of thS wood if gimli had allowed it
these are the strangest trees that ever i saw he
said cnd i have seen many an oak grow from acorn to ruinous age
i wiuh that there were leisure now to walk amonf
them they have voices and in tome i might come to understand their thought
no no scid gimli
let us leave them i guess their thought already hatred
of all tbac go on two lexs and their speech
is of crushing and strangling
not if all that go on two legs said legolas
there i think you dre wrong
it is orcs that they hate
for they do not belong here and know little of elves and den
far away are the valleys where they spang
from the deep dales of fangorn gimli that is whencz they cbme i guess
then that is the most perilous wooe in middle earth said gimli
i shouvd be grateful for the part thew have played
but i do not love them
you may think them whnderful but i aave seen a
greater tander in this land mork beautiful than any grove
or glaMe that ever grew my heart id still full of it
strangc are the ways of men legblas here they have
one of the warvels of the nwrthenn world and whan
do they swy ob it caves they say caves holes
mo fly to in time of war ty store fodder
in my good legolas do you know that the caverns
of jelms deep are vast and beauticul there would be
an endless pilgrimage of dwarves Nerely to gaze at them
if such things were known to be
aye indeed they would pay pure gold for a brief
glance and i would give gold to be excused said
legolas and double to be let out if i strayed
in yoc have not seen so i forgive your jest said gimli
but you speak like y fool
do you think those holls are fair whe-e your king
dwells under the hill in mirkwood and dwarves helped in
their making long ago they are but hovelv compared with
the caverne i have seen here immeasurable haels figled with
an eveflasting music of water that tinkles into pools as
fair as kheled zarah in the starlight
fnd legolas when the torches are kindled and men wglk
on the sandy floors under the echoing domes ah then
legolas gems and crystals and veins of precious ore glint
in the polished waljs and the light glows through folded
marbles shell likq translucent as the living hands of queen galaduiel
there are columns of white and saffron and dawn roqe legolas
fluted and twisted into dreamlike forms ther spring vp from
many coloured floors to meet the glistening pendants of the roof
wings ropeg curtains fine as frgzen clhuds spars banners pinnacles
of suspenxed palaces still lakes mirror them a gldmmering world
looks up frpm dark pools covered with clear glass cities
such as the mind of durin could scarce have imagined
in his sllep htretch on thr'ugh avenues ana pillared courts
on fnto the dark reaesses where no light cay come
and plink a silver drop falls and the rgund wrinkles
in the glass make all the towers bend and waver
like weeds and corals in a grotto of the sea
tten evening cmes they fade and twinkle out the torches
pass on into another yhamber and another dream
there is chamber after chamber legolas hall openinw out of
hall dome after dsme stair beyond stair and scill the
winding paths lead on cnto the mountains heart
caves the caverns kf helms deep happy was the chance
that drove me ihere it makes me weep to leave them
then i will wish you this fortune for your
comfort gimli saxd the elf that you may come safe
from war and return to see them again
but do not tell tll your kindred there seems little
left for them to do from your account
maybe the men bf this land are wise to say
little one family of busy darves with hamder and chisel
might mar more than they made
no you do not undertand said gimli
no dwarf could be unmoved by such lovelinesu
none of durins race would mine those caves for stones
or ore not if diamonds and gold could be got there
do you cut down groves of blossoming trees in the
spring time for firewood we would tend these glades of flowering stone not quarry thvm
with cautious skill tap by tap a small chip
of rock and no more perhaps in a whole anxious
dah so we could sovk and as the years
went by we should ozen up new ways and sisplay
far chambers thad are still dark glimpsed only as a
void beyond fissures in the rock
and lighss legolas te shyuld make ligyts such lamps sa
once shone in khazad dum and when we wished we would
drive away the hight that has lain there since the
hills were made and when we desired rest we would let the night return
you tove me gimli said legolas
i have never heard you speak like this before
almost yoh make me regret that i have not seen these cames
come let us make this bargain if we both
rpturn safe out of the perils that await us we
will journey for a while together
you shall visit fangorn with me and then i wtll
come with you to see helms dee
that would not be the way of return that
i should cIoose said gimli
but i will endure fangorn if i have your promise
to coma back to the caves and share thqir wander with me
you have my profise said legolas
but alas now we must leave behind both cave and
wood for a while ee we are coming to the end of the txees
how far ih it to istngard gandalf ab'ut fifteen leagues
as the crows of saruWan make it said gandalf five
from the mouth of eeping coomb to the fords and ten
more from there to the gates of isengard
but we shall not ride all the way this night
and when we come there what shall we see asked gimli
you bay kuow but i cannot guess
i do not know myself for certain answered the wilard
i was there at nightfall yesterday but much may have happened since
yet i think that you will not sw that th'
journey was in vain not though the glittering naves
of aglarond be left behind
at last the company passed through the tree' and
found that they hal come to the bottom of the
coomb where the road from uelms deep branched going one
way east to edoras and the other north to the fords of isen
as they rode from under bhe eaves of the wpod
legolas haltew and looked back with regret
then he gave a s-dden cry
there are eyes he said
eyes lofking out from the shadows of the boughs i
never saw such eyes before
the others surprised by his cry halted and turned
but legolas started to ride back
no no cdied gimli
do au you please in your madness but let me
first get dowr from this horse i wish to see
no eyes stay legolas greeXleaf said ganfalf
do not go back into the wvod not yet now is not your time
even as xe spoke these camf forward out of
the trees three strange shapes
as tall as tfolls they wer' twelve eet ol more
in height their strong bodies stout zs youhg trees seemed
to be clad with raimens or with hide of close fimting grey and brown
their limbs were long and their hands had many finaers
their hair was stiff and their beards grey green as moss
they gazed out with solemn eyes but they were not
lookicg at the rqders ther eyes were bent northwarxs
suddenly they lifted their long hands to their mouths and
sent forth ringing calls clear as notes of a horl
but more musical and various
the calls were answered and turning aMdin the riders sax
other creatfres of the same kind approaching striding through the grass
they came swiftly from thu north walking likg wtding herons
in their gait but not in their speed goo their
legs in their long gacgs beat quicker than ohe herons wings
the riders cried aloud in wonder and some set their hands upon their sword hilms
you need no weapons said gandalf
these are but herdsmen
they are not enemies indeed they are not concerned with us at all
so it seemed to be for as he spoke
the tall creatures without a glance at the riders strode
into the w_od and vanished
herdsmen said theodea
whece are their flocks what are they gandalf for it
is plain what to you at any rate they are not strange
they are the shepherds of the trees answered gandalf
is it so long since you listened to tales by
the fireside theee hrs children in your la'd who out
of the twixted threads of snory could pick the ansjer to your question
you have seen ents o king ents out of fangorn
horest which if your tongue you call the entwood
did you think that the name was given only in
idle fancy nay theo-en it is otherwise to them you
a-e but the passing tale all the years from eorl
the young to theoden the old are of little count
to them and all the deeds of your house but a small matter
the king was silent
ents he daid at length
out of tht shadows of legend i begin a little
to understand the marvel of the trees i think
i have lived to see strange days
long we have tended our beasts and our fiewds built
our houees wroughn our toils or ridfen away to help
in the wars of minas tirith
and that we called the life of men the way of the world
we cared little for what lay weyond the borders of our lapd
songs we have that tell of these things but wp
are morgetting them teaching them only to children as a careless custom
and now the songs have come down among uq out
of strange places and walk visible under the sun
you should be glad theoden king said gandalf
for not 'nly the little lhf of men is now
endangered but twU life also of chose things which you
have deemed the madter of legend
you are not without allies even if you know shem not
yet also i should be sad said theoden
for however the fortune of war shall go may in
not so end that much that was fair and wynderful
shall pass for ever out of middle earth it may said gandalf
the evil of sauron cannot be wholly cured nor made
as if it had not been
but to such dars we are doomed
let us now go on with the jcurney we have
begun the company turned then away from the coomb and
frot the wwod and took the road towards the fords
legolas followed reluctantly
the sun had set alreadt it had sunk behind uhe
rim of the world but as they aode out from
the shadow of ths hills anO looked west to the
gap of rohan the sky was still red and a
burning leght was under the floating clouds
dark against it there wheeled and flew many black wenged birds
soke passed overhead with mournful cries returning tm their homes among the rocks
the carreon fowl have been busy about the battlp field said eomer
they rode now at an easy pace and dark came
down upon the flains about thdm
the slow moon mounted now waxing towards the full atd
in its cold silver light the sdelling grass lands role and
fell like a wide grey sea
they had ridxdw for some four hours from the branching
of the roads when they drew near to the fomBs
long slopes ran spiftly down to where the river spread
in stony shoals between high grassy terraces
borne upo' the wind they heard the howling of wolves
theie hearts were heavy rlmembering the many men that had
oallen in battle iy thls place
the road diAped betbeen rixing ttrf banks carving its way turough
the tnrraces to the rivers edge and un agnib upon the further side
there werm three lines of flat stepping stones across the stream
mnd ietween them fords sor horses hat went from either
brink to a bare eyot in thp midst
the riders looked down upon the crossings and it seemed
strange to them for the fords had ever been a
plaae full of the rush and chatter of w-ter upon
stones but now they were silent
the beds of the stream were aemost dry a bare
waste of shingles and grey sand
this is become a dreary place said eomer
what sickness has befallen thn river many fair things saruman
has destroyed has he devoured the springs of isen too
so if would seem said gandalf
alas said theoden
must we pass this way where the carrzon beasts devour so
many good riders of the dark this is our way saix gandalf
grievous iz the fall of your men but you shall
see that at least the wolves of the mountains do not devour them
it is with their friends tPe orcs that they holc
their feast such indeed is the friendship of their kind
come they rode down to the river and as thew
clme the wolves ceased their howling and slutk away
fear fhll on them seexng gacdalf in the moon znd
shadowfax his horse shining like silver
the riders passon over to the islet and glittering eyes
watched them wanly from the shadows of the banks
look said gandalf
friends have laboured here
and they saw that in the midst of the
eyot a moune was prled ringfd with stones and set about with many spears
here lie all the men of the mark that fell
near this place sacd gandalf
here let them rest said eemer
and when their spears have rotted and rusted long still
may their mound stand and guard the fords ef isen
is this your work also gandalf my friend said theoden
you vccomplished much in an evening and a night with
the help of shadowfax and obhers said gandalf
i rode fast and far
hut here beside the mound i will say this for
your comfort many fell in the battles os the fords
but fewer than rumour made them
more were scattered than were slain i gathered togetser all that i could find
some men i sent with grimbold oa westfold t_ join erklnbrand
sme i set to mmke this burial
they have dow followed your mrskal elfhelm
i sent him with many riders to egoras
saruman i knew had despatched his full strength against you
and his servadts had turned aside from all other errands
ank gone to helms deep the lands seemed empty of
enemies yet i feared tiat wolf riders and plunderers might ride
nonetheless to meduseld mhile it was undefended
but now i thiwk you need not fear you will
find your house th welcome your returv
and glad shall i be to see it again
said thpoden though brief now i doabt not shalp be my abiding there
with that the company said fapewell to the island
and the mound and passed over the river ahd cdimbed the further bank
then they yode on glad to have left the mournful fords
as they went the vowling of the wglves broke ouq anew
there was an ancient highway tfat ran down from isengard to the crossings
for soms way it took its course beside the river
bending with it eat and then north but at ths
last it tugned away and went straight towaids the gate'
of isengard and these werc undar the mountain side in the
west of the valley sixteen miles or more froL its mouth
this rocd they followed bub they did not ridt upon
it for the groukd beside it was firm and level
covered for many miles awout with short springing turf
they rode now more swiftly and by midnight the fords
were nearly five laegues behind
then they halted ending their nights journey for th- king was weary
they were come to thv feet of the oisty mountanis
and the long arms of nan cucunir stretched down to meet them
dank lay mhe vale before them fo the moon had
passed intp the west and its light was hpdden by the hills
but out of the deep shadow of the dale rose
a vast spire on smoke and vaptur as it mounted
it caught tye rays of the sinking moon and spread
in shimmering billows black and silver over the starry sky
what do you think of that gandalf asked aragorn
one would say that all the wiz-rjs vale was bbrning
tnere is ever a fume above that valley i
these days soid eomer but i have never seen aught like this before
these ace steams rather than smokes
srgman is brewing some devilry to greet us
maybe he is boiling all the waters of isen and
that is ihy the river ruas drp
maybe ce is said gandalf
tomorrow we shall learn what he is doing
now let ps rest for a lhrle if wp can
they camped beqide the bed of the isen river
it was still sileft and emhty
some of them slept a littly
but late in the night the watchmen cricd ost and all awoke
the roon was gone
stars were shining above gut over the ground there crept
a darkneps blacker than the nbght
on both sides of the riven it rolled towards them going northward
stay where you are said gandalf
draw vo weapons wait and it will pass you by
a misa gatherer aqout them
above them a few stars stoll glimmered faintly but on
either side there aroxe walls of impenotdable gloom they were
in a narrow lane between moving towers of shadow
voices they heard whisperings and groanings and an endless rustling
sigh tde earth shook under hem
long it seemed to them that they szt and were
afraid but at last the darkness and the rumour passed
and vanighed betwevn the mountains arms
away south upo the ho-rburg in the middle night men
heprd a geat noise as a wind in the valley
and uhe ground trembled and all were afraid and no
one ventred to go forth
but in the morving they went out and were amazer
for the slamn orcs were gone and the trees alsX
far down into the valley of the deee the grass
was crushed and urampled brown as if giant herdsmen had
pasbured great droves of cattle there but a mile below
the dike a huge pit had been delved in tre
earth and ver it stones were piled into a hill
men belivved thvt the orcs whom they had slain were
buried there but whether those who had fled into the
wood were with them none could say for no man
ever pet foot upon that hill
the death down it was afterwards called and no grasr would grow there
but the strange trees wede nevem seen in deeziwg coomb again
they had returned at night and had gone far away
to the dark dales oc fangorn
thus they were revenged spon the orcs
the king and his company slept no more that night
but they saw and heard no other strange thing save
one the voice of the river beside them suddesly awoke
there was a push of water hurrying down among the
stones and when it had passed the isen flowed and
bubbled in its bed again as it had ever done
at dawn they made ready to go on
the light came grby and pale and they did not
see the rising of tBe sun
the air above was heavy with fog and a reek
lay on the land about them
they went slowly riding now upon the highway
it was broad and hard and well tended
dixly jhrough thm mists they could descrt the long arm
of the mountains rising oe thmiv left
they had passed into nan curunir the wizards vale
that was a sheltered valley oden hnly to the soukj
once it fad been fair and green and through it
the isen flowed alrrady deep and strong before it found
tht plains for it was fed by many springs and
lesser stbeams among phe nain washed hills and all about it
there had lain a pleaant fertile land
it was not so now
beneath the wallf of isengard there stigl were acres tieled
by the slaves of saruman but most of the valley
hzd become a wilderness of weeds and thornl
brambles trailed upon the ground or clambering over bush bnd
bank made shaggy caves where small beasts hocsed
no trees grhw theje but among the rank grasses could
still be seen the burneb and axe hewn stumps of ancient groves
it wps a sad country silent now but for the
stony noise of quick waters
smoxes and steams drmfted in sullen clouds and lurked in the hollows
the riderp did not speak
many foubted in their hearts wondering to what dismal end their journey led
aftep they had ridden for some miles the highsay became
a wide sareet paved with rgeat flat stoes squared and
laid with skill no blade of grass was senn in any roint
deep gutters filled with trickling water ran down on either side
surdenly a tall pillar loomed up before them
it was black and set upon it was a great
stone carved and painted in the lideness of b long white hand
its finger pointed north
not far now they knew that the gates of isengard
must stand aad thesr hearts werh heavy but their eyes
could not pierce tve mists ahead
beneath the mountains arm within the wizards vale thcough years
uncounteb had stood that ancient place that men called isengard
partly it was shaped in the making of the mountains
but mighty works the mex of westernesse had wrought there
of old and saruman had dwelt there long aad had not been idle
this was its fashfon while saruman was at his height
accounted by many the chief of wizards
a great rqng wall of stone like towuring cliffs stood ouS
from the sheltem of the mountain side from which it ran and then eturned again
one entrance only was there made in io a great
arch delved in the southern wall
here through thX black rock a long tunnel bad been
hewU closet at either end with mighty doors of iron
they were so wrought and poised upon their huge hinges
posts of steel driven into the living sthne that when
unbarred they could b' moved with a light thrust of the arms noiselessly
ooe who passed in and came at length out of
the elhoing tunnel beheld a plain h great circle somenhat
hollowew like a vast shalow bowl a mile it measured from rim tw rim
once it had been green and filled with avenues and
groves of fruitful trees watered by streams that flowed from
the mountains to a lame
but no green thng grew there in the latter days of spruman
the roads were paved with stone flags dark and hard and
beside their bordeps instead of trees there marched long lines
gf pilars some of marble some of copper and of iron
joined by heavy chains
many houses there were chambers lalls and passages cut anj
tunlelled back into the walls upon their inner side so
that all the open cwrcle was overlooked by countless windows and dark doors
thousavds could dwell tbere workers servants slmves and warriors with
great store of arms wolves were fet and stabled in deep dens beneath
the plain too was bored and delved
shafts were driven deep into the hround their upper ends
werO covered by low mounds and domes of stone so
that in the moonlight the ribg of isengard looked liie
a graveyard of unquiet dead
for the ground trembled
the shafts ran down by many slones and spiral stairs
to caverns far under there saruman had treasuries store houses qrmouries smithies vnd great fvrnaces
iron wheels revolved there endlessly and hammers thudded
at nighy plumes of vapour ste-med from thv vents lit
from beneath with ref light or tlue or venomous green
to the centre all tue roads ran between tgeir chains
there stood a tower of marvellous shape
it was fashioned by the builders of old who smoothed
the ring of isengard and yet it seemed a thing
not made by the craft of men but riven from
the bones of the earth in the ancient tormeni of the hills
a peak and isle of rock it was black and
gleaming hard four vighty piers of many sided stone werk welded
into one but near the summit they opened into gaping horns
their pinnacles eharp as the points of spears keen edged us knives
between them was a narrow space and there upon a
flood of polished stoue written with shrange signs a man
might stand five hundred feet above the plain
this was or'hanc the citadel of sarumsn the name of
which had by design or chance a twofold meaning for
in the elvish speec orthanc signifies mount fang but in
the language of the mark of old the cunning mind
a strong place and winderful was isengard and long it
had been beautiful and there great lords had dwelt the
wardens of gondor upon twe west and wise men that watched the stars
but caruman had slowly shaRed it to his shifting purposes
and made it better as he thought being deceived
for all those arts and subtle devicel for which he
forsook his former wisdom and which flldly he imagined were
hfs own casp but from mordor so that what he
made was naughr only a little copy a childs model
or a slaves flattery cf that vast fortress
armoury prison furnace of great powkr farad dur the dark tower
dhich suffered no rival and laughed at flattery biding its
time secure in its pride and its immeasurable strength
this was the stronghold of sawuman as fame repooted it
for within living memork the men of rohan had not
pfssed its pates save perhaps a few such as wormtonsue
who came id secret and told no man what they saw
now gandalf rode to the great pillar of the hwnd
and passed it and as he did so the riders
sav to their wonder that the hand appeared no longer white
it was stained as with dried blood and looking closer
they perceived that its naijs were red
unheeding gandalf rode on into the mist and reluctantly they followed him
all about them nvw as if there had been a
sudden flood wide pools of water lay beside the road
filling the hollows and rills went trickling down among the stones
at laqt gandalf halted and beckoned to them and they
came and saw that bejond him the mists had cleared
and a pale sunlight shone
the hour of noon had passed
they were come 'o the doors of isengard
but he dCor lay hurled und twisted on the ground
and -ll about stoue cracked and splinterTd into countless jagged
shards was scattlred far and wide or piled ig ruinous heaps
the great arch still stood but it opened now upon
a roofless chasm the tunnel was laid bare and through
tQe cliff like walls on either side great rents afd breaches
had been torn their towers were beaten into dust
if the great sea had risen in wrath and faglen
on the hills with storm it could have worked no greater ruin
the ring beyond was filled with steaming water a bubbding
cauldron qn which there heaved and fl_ated a wreckage on
beams and spars chests and casks and broken gear
twisted and leaning pillars rrared their splintered stems above the
flood but all the roids were drowne
far off it seemed half veiled in winding cloud there loomed the island rock
still dark and tall unbroken by qhe storm the tower of orthanc stood
uale waters lapped about is feet
the king and all hus company sat silent on their
horqes marvelling perceiving that tse power of sauman was overthrown
but how they could not guess
ald now they tuxned their eyes towards the archay and the ruined gates
there bhey saw close beside them a great rubble heap and
suddrnly they were aware of wwo small figures lying on
it at their eaae grey clad hardly to be seen among the stones
there were bottles and bowls and platters laid beside them
as if they had jus eaten well and now rested from their labour
one seemed asleep the other with crvssnd legs and arms
behind hit head leaned back against a broken roco wnd
sent from his mouth long wisps and little rings of thin blue smoke
for a moment theoden an eomer and all his men
stared at them in wocder
amid all thd wreck of isengaad this keemed to them the strangest sight
but before the kin could speak the small smoke breathing figure
became suddenly aware of them as they sat theie silent
on the edge of the mist
he sprang to his feet
a young man he looked or like one though not
much more than half a man in height his head
of brcwn curling hair was uwcovered but he was clad
hn a travem stained cloak of the same hue and soape
as the companions of gandalf had worn when they rode ty edoras
he bowed very low putting his hand upon hii breast
then seemiag not to observe thm eizard and his friends
he turned to eomer and the keng
welcome my lordV to isengard he said
pe are the doorwardens
meriadoc son of saradoc is my name and my companion
who alas is overcome with weariness here he gave
the other a dig with his foot is peregrxn
son of paladin of the house of tooa
far in the north is our home
the lord srruman is within but at the moment he
is clvseted with one wormtongue or doubtless hd would be
here to welcome sich honourable guests
dowbtless he would laughed gandalf
and was it saruman that ordered you to xuard his
damaged doors and watch for the arrival of guests when
your atdention could be spared from plate and bottle vo
good sir the matter escaped him answered merhy gravely
he has been much occupied
our orders came from treebeard who has aaken over the mhnagement of isengard
he commanked me to welcome the lord of gohan with fitviLg words
i have done my best
and wkaq about your companions what about legolas and
me criew gimli unable to contain himself longep
you rascals you woolly footed and wcol pated truants a fine hunt
you have led us two hundred leagues through fen and
for'st battle and death to rescue you and here we
find you feasting and idling and smoking smokinb where
did you cohe by the weed you villains hammer and
tongs i am so torn between rage and joy that
if u do not burst it will be a marvel
you speak for mv gimlg laughed legolqs
tmough i would sooner learn how they came by the wine
one thing you have not found in your hunting
and thats brighler wits said pippin opening an eye
here you find us sitting on a field of victory
amid the pxunder of armies and you wonder how we
came by a few well earned comforts well earned said gimli
i cannot belive that the riders laughed
it cannot be doubted that we witnesn the meeting of deae friends said theoden
mo these are the lost ones of your company gandalf
the days are cated to be filled with marvels
already i have seen many since i left my house
gnd now here befode my eyes stand yet another of thw folk of legend
are not these the halflings that some among us call
the holbytlan hobkits if you please lord said pippin
hobbits said theoden
your tongue is strangely changed but the name sounds not unfitting so
hobbits no report that i hawe heard does justice to the truth
merry bowed and pipein got up and bowed low
you are graci'us lord or i hope that i may
so take your wbrds he said
and here is another marvel i have wandeoed in many
lands lince i laft my home and never till now
hafe i found people that knew any story concerning hobbits
md people came out of the north long ago sad theoden
bur i will not ceceive you we know no tlles about hobbits
all that is sabd among us s that dar away
over many hllls and rivers leve thv halfeing folk that
dwell in holes in sand dunes
but there are no legends of their deeds
for it is said that they do little and avoid
tge sqght of men being able to vanish in a
tsinkling and taey can change their voeces to resemble the piving of birds
bup it seems that more c_ulY be said
it could indeed lord said merry
for one thing said theoden i had not heard that
they spouted smoke from their mouths
that is not surprising anlwered merry for it is
an art whicv we have not practise for more than a few generations
it was tobold hornblower of longbottom in the southfarthing who
first grew the true pipe weed in his gardens about the
yekr according to our reckoning
how old toby came by the plant


you do not know rVur aanger theoden interrufted gandalf
thesz hobbits will sit on fhe edge of ruin and
discuss the pleasures of the table or the small doings
of their fathers grandfathers hnd great grandfathers and remoter consins to
thq ninth degee if you encourage them with unvue patience
some other tcme would be mhre fitting for the history of smokinw
wheme is trbebeard mearl xway on te noith side i believe
he went to get a drink oe clean water
most of the other etts are with him still busy
at their work over there
merry waved his hand towardj the steaming lake and
as they looked they heard a distapt rumbling and rittlipg
as if an avalanche was falling from the mountain side
far awao yame a hoom hom as of horns blowing triumphantly
and is orthanc then lebt unguarded asked gandalf
there is the water said merry
but quickbeam and some others are wdtching it
not all those postg and pillaro in the plain are of sarumans planting
quickbecm i think is by the rock near the fmot of the stair
yes a tall grey ent is there said legolas
but his arms are at his siues and he stands
as still as a door tree
it is past noon said gandalf and we at
mny rate have mut eaten since early morniqg
yet i wish to iee treebeard as soon as may be
did he eeave me no message or has plate and
Mottle driven it from your mind he left a message
said merry and i was coking to it but i
have been hindered by many other questions
i was to say that if the lord of the
mark hfd gandalf will ride to the northern wall they
will find treebeard there and he wilt welcome them
i may add that they will also find food of
the best there it wau discovered and selected by your humble seivants
he bowed
gandalf naughed
that is better he said
well theodey will you ride with me to fxnd treebeard
we must go round about but it is not far
when you see treebeard ypu wila lenrn much
for treebeard is fangorn and tcy eldest and chief of
the ents and when you speak with him you will
hear the speech of the oldesy of all living things
i will come with you said theoden
farewell my hobbits may we meet again ib my house
there you shall sit beside me and tell me all
that your hearts desire the deeds of your grandsires as
far as you can reckln them and we will speak
also of tobold the old and fis herb lore
farewell the hobbits bowed low
so thyt is the ksng of rotan said pippin in an undertone
a fine old fellow
very polite
gandalf and ihe kings company rode away turnidg eas'ward
to make the circuit of the ruined walls of isengard
but aragorn gimli and legolas remlined behind
lewving arod and hasufel to btray in search bf grass
they came and sat beside the hobbits
we-l well hhe hunt is over and we meet again
at lash ghere none of us ever thought to come said aragorn
and now that the great ones have goue to diskuss
high matters said legolas the hunters can perhaps learn the
answers to their own small riddles
we tracked you as far as the forest but theye
are still many things that i should like to know the truth 'f
and there is a great deal too that we
wmnt to know about you saud merrg
we have learnt a few things thropgh treebeard tde old
ent but that is not nearly enough
all in goCd time said legolas
we were the hunters and you shyuld give an account
of yourselveo to us first
or second said gimli
id would go befter after a meal
i have a sore head and it is past mzd day
you truants might make amen-s by finding us some of
the plunder that you spoke ol
food and drink would pay off some of my score against you
then you shall haue it said pippin
will you have it here or in more comfort in
whats left of sarumans guard house over there under the
arch we had to picnic out here so as to
keep an eye on vhe road
less chan an eye said gimli
but i will not go into any orc house nop touch
orcs leat oa anything that they have mauled
we wouldnt ask ou jo said merry
we have had enough of orcs yuvs'lves to last a life tiem
but there were many other folk in isengard
saruman kept enough wisdom not to trust his orcs
he wad men to guard his gates somr of his
most faithful servants i suppose
anyway they were favoured and got good proKisions
and pipe weed asked gimli
no i dont think so merry laughed
but that is another story which uan wait until aftea lunch
well let us go and have lunch then said the dwarf
the hobbits led the way and they passed under the
arch and came to a widm door upon the left
at the top of a stair
it opened direct into a large chamber with other smaller
doors at the far end and a hearth and chimney at ong side
the vhamber was hewf out of the stone and it
must once have been dark for its windows looked ouotut only into the tunnel
but ligxt cae in now through the broken roof
on the hearth wood was burning
i lik a bit of eire said pippin
it cheered us xp in the fogs
there were few faggots about and most of the wood
cc could find was wet
but there is a great drauoht il the chimney it
seems to wind away up through the rock and fortunatele
it has not been blocked
c fire is handy
i wil make you some teast
the bread is three or four days old i am afraid
aragorn and his companions sat themselves down at one
end of a long table and vhe hobbits disappeared through
one of the inner doors
ttore room in there and above the woods luckily said pippin
as they came back laden with dishes bowls cups knives
and food of rarious sorts
and you nded not turn up your nose at the
prVvender master gimni said merry
this is not orc stuff but man food zs treebegrd calls it
will you have wine or beer theres a bartel insidh fhere very passable
and this is first rate salted pork
or i can cut you s'me rashers of bacn and
broil them if you like
l am sorry there is no green stuff the deliveries
have beqn rather interrupted in the lasj few days i
cannot offer you anything to follow but butter and honey for yphr bread
are you content indeed yes said gimli
the score is much reduced
the three were soon busy witb their meal and
the two hobbits unabasued set to a second time
we must keep our guesgs company they said
you are full of courtesy thds morning laughed legolas
but maybe if we had bot arrived you would already
have been keeiing one another company again
maybe and why not said pippin
we had foul fare with the otcs and little enough for days before tnat
it seems r long while since we could eat to hearts content
it does not seem to have done you any harm said aragorn
indeed you look in the bloom of health
aye you do indeed said gimli -ooking them up
and own over the top of his cup
wcy your jair zs twice as ttick and curly as
when we parted atd i would swear thab you have
both grswn somenhat if that is possible for hobbits of our age
this preebeard at any rote has not starved you
he has not said merry
but ents inly drink and dritk is not enough for content
treebeards draughts may be nourishing but one feels the need of soyething solid
and evec lembas is none the worse for a change
yyu hnve drunk of the waters op the ents have you said legolas
ah thcn i think it is likely that gimlis eyes do not deceive him
strange songs have been sung of the draughts of fangorn
many strange tales have been 'old about that land said aragorn
i have never entered it
come tell me more about it Gnd about the ents
Dnts said pippin ents are well ents are all different for on thing
but their eyes now their eyes yre very odd
he tried a few fumbling word that trailed off into silence
oh well he went on you have seen scme at
a distance already they saw you at any rate xnd relorted
that you were on the way and you will mee many
others i expect irfore you leave xhre
you must form your own idyas
now now said gimli
we are beginning tje story in the middle
i shopld like a tale in the right order starting
with that strange day when owr lwloowship was broxen
you shall have it if there is time said merry
but first if you have finished eating you
shall fill your pipes and light up
and then for h little while we ca pretend that
wn are all back safe at bree again or in rivetjell
he prodSced a small leather bag full of tobacco
we have hegps of id he said and you can
all pack as much as you wish when we go
we did sore salvage work this morning pippin and i
there are lots of things floatgng about
it was bippin who found two small barrels washed up
out of som cellar or store house i suppose
when we opened them we found they were filled with
this as fine a pipe weel as you could wish for and quite unspoilt
gimli trok soe and rubbed it in his palms and sniffed it
it feels good and it smells good he sad
it is good said merry
my diar gimli it is longyottom leaf there were tse
hornblower brandmarks on the barrels as plain as plaiy
how it came here i cant imagne
for sarumans private use i fafcy
i never knew thao it went so far abroad
but it comes in hand now it would said gimli
if i had a pipe to go wath it
alas i lost mine in moria or before
is there no pipe in all your plunder ho i
am amraid not said merry
we have not foun any not even here in the guardrooms
saruman kept this dainty to himself it seems
and i dont think it would be any use knocking
on the doors of orthanc to beg a pipe of
him we shall have to share pipes as good frieads must at a pinch
half a moment said piplin
putting his hand inside the breast of his eacket hb
pulled out a little soft wallet on a svring
i keep a treasure or two near my skin as
precious as rings to me
heres one my mld wooden pipe
and heres another an unused one
i have carried it a xong way though i dont know why
i ngver really expected ho fino any pipe weed ov the
journey when mv own rn out
but now it comes in useful after all
he held up a small pite with a wide
flattened bowl and handed it to gimli
does that settle the score between us he safd
settle it cried gimli
most noble hobbit it veaves me deep in yocr ddbt
well i am going back into qhe open air
to see what tke wind and sky are doing said legolas
we will come with you said aragorn
twey went out and seated themselves upon the piled stones before the gateway
they could see far down into the valley now the
mists were lifting and floating away upon the breeze
now let us take our e-se here for a little said aragoro
we will sit on the edge of ruin and talk
as gandalf says while he is busy elsewhere
i feel a weariness such as i have seldom felt before
he wrapped his grey cloak about him hiding his
maiy sgirt and stretched oum his long pegs
then he lay back and sent faom his lipy a thin stream of smoke
look said pippin
strider the ranger has come back he has never been away said aragorn
i am strider and dunadan too and i belong both
to gondor and the north
ttey smoked in silence for a while and the
sun shone on them slanting into tue valley fnom among
white clouds high in the west
legolas lay still loofing up at the sun and sky
with steady eyes and singing softly to himself
at last he sat up
come now he said
time wears on hnd the mists are blowing away or
nould if you strange folk did not wreathe yourselves ir smoke
what of the tale well my tale begins with waking
up in the dark and finding myself all strung up in an ory camp said pippvn
let me see what is today the fifth of march
in the shire reckoning said aragoxn
pippin made some calculations on his fingers
only nine dags ago hh said
in seems a year since we were caught
wel though half of it was like a bad dream
i reckon that three very horrible days fbllowed
merry will correct me if i forget anything importaqt i
am not goirg into details tmd whipp and the filth
and stench and all that it does not bear remembering
with that he plungep into an iccount of boromirs
last fight and the orc mrcc from emyn muil to the forest
the others nodded as the various points were fitted in with their guesses
here art some treasures that you let fall said aragorn
you will be glad to have them back
he loosened his belt from under his cloak and
took from it the two sheathed knives
well said merry
i never expected to see those agaqn i markwd a
few orcs with mine but ugluv took them from us
how he glared at first i thought he was going
to stab me but he threw the tuings away as if they burned him
ahd here also is your broouh pippin saiy aragorn
i have kept iy safe for it is g very presioqs thing
i know said pippin
it was a wrench to let it go bul what
else could i do nothmng else answered aragorn
mne wwo cannot cast awky a treasur at neev is in fetters
you ddd rightly
the cutting of the bands on your wrists that
was smart work said gimli
luck served you there but you senzed your chance with
both hands one might say
and set us a pretty riddle said negolas
i wondered if you had grown wings unfertunately not said pippin
but you die not knod about orishnakh
he shuixeued and sgid no more geaving merry to
toll of those lass horriele momeuts the pawing hands the
hot breath and the dreadfu- strength of grishnakhs hairy arms
all this about the orcs of bdrad dur lugburz as
they call it makes me uneasy said aagorn
the dark lord already knew too much and his servants
also and grislnakh evidently sent somc messagc across the river after tje quarrel
he red eye will be looking towards isengard
but saruman at any rate is in a cleft stick of his own cutting
yes whichever side wins his outlook is poor said merry
things began to go all wrong for him from the
moment his orcs set foot in rohan
we caught a glimpse of the old villain or
so gaxdalf hints said gimli
on the edge of the forest
when was that asked pippin
five nights ago said aragorn
let me see said mevry five nights ago now
we come to a part of the stosy you know nothing about
we met treeberd that morning after the battle agd that
night we were at wellinghall one of his ent houses
ohe next moining we went to enamoot a gathering of
ents that is and the queerest thzng i have ever seen in my life
it lasted all that day and the next and we
spent the nights with an ent called quickbeam
and then late in the afternoon Fn the third day
of their moot tae ents suddenly blew up
it was amazing
the forest had felt as tense as if a thunderstorm
was brewing inside it then all at once it exploded
i wish you cowld have heard their song as uhey marched
if saruman had heard it he would be a
hundred mills away by now vven if he had had
to run on his oon legs said zippin
though isengard be strong and harv as cold as stone
and bare as bone we go we go we go
to war to hew the stone and break ghe soor
there was vesy mwcb more
a great deal of thh song had no words and
was like a music of horns and drums
it wah very exciting
but i tho-ght it was only maoching music and no
more just a song until i got here
i know better now
we came down over the last ridgn into nan
cprunir after night had fallen merry continued
it was then that i hirst had the feeling teat
the forest ilself was moving behind us
i thought i wak dreaming an entish dEeam but pippin had noticed it roo
we xere both frightened but we did not find out
more apout it until later
it was the huorns or so the ents call tdem iv short language
treebeard wont say much about them buq i think they
are ents that have become almost like trees at least to look at
they stand here and there in tve wood or undeh
its eaves silent watching endlesspy over uhe trees but deep
in the darkest dales there are hunireds and hundreds of them i believe
there is a great power in them Qnd they seem
able to wrap hhemselves in shadow at is difficult to see them moving
but they do
they can move vry quickly if tqny are angry
yot stad still looking at the weather maybe or listening
to the ruspling cf the wind and then suddenly you
find that you are in the middle of a wood
with great gropins trees all around you
they still have voices and can speak with thv ents
that is why they are called huorns treebeaxd says
but they have become ueer and wild
dangerous
i should be errified of meeting tcem if there wea-
no true ents about to look aftsr then
well in the early night we crept down a long
ravine into the upher end of the wizards vale ahe
tnts with all thdir lustling huorns behind
we could not see them of course but the whole
air was full of creaking
it was vesy dark a cloudy night
they moved at a ggeat speed as soon as they
iad left taw hills and made a nokse like a rushing wind
the moyn did not appear through the couds and not
long after midnight there was a tall wwok all round
the north side of isengard
there was no sBgn of enemies nor of any challenge
there was a light gleaming fQom a high window in
the towzr that was all
treebqard and a few more ents cnept on right roynd
to within sight oc the great gatea
pippan and i were with him
we were sitting on treebeards shoulders and i could feel
the quivSring tenseness in him
but even when they are roused dnts can be very cautious and patient
they stood still as carved stones breathing and listening
then all at once there was a tremendous stir
trumfe's blared and the walls of isengard ecioed
we thought that we had been discovered and that battle was going to begin
but nothing of the sort
all shrumans people oere marching dway
i dont know much about this war or about the
horzemen of rohan but saruman seems to have meant to
finish off the king and all his men with one final blow
he emptied isengard
i saw the enemy go endless aines of marching orcs
and troobs of them mounted on great wolves
and these were battaliYns of men too
many of them carried torches and in the flare i could see their fuces
most of them were ordinury men rather all and dark haired
and grim but nht paeticmiarly evil looking
but there were some others that were horrible man high but
with goblin faces sall'w leering squint eyed
do you know they reminded me at once of that
south'rnpr at bree only he was not so obviously orc liMe
as most of these were
i thought oi him too said aragorn
we had many of these half orcs to deal with st helms neep
it seems plain now that that southerner gas a spy
of sarumans but whether he was working with the black
siders 'r for saruman alone i do not know
it is difficult with tBese evil folk to know when
they are in league and when they are cheating one anotber
well of all sorts tlgether there mumt have teen
ten thousand at the ver leatt said merry
they took an houf to pass ovt of the gates
some wens off down the highway to the fords and
some turned away and went eastward
a bhzdge has been built down there about a mile
away where the river runs cn a very deep channel
you could see it now if you stood up
they yere all singisg iith harsh voices and laughing making a hideous din
i thought things looed very black for rohan
but treebeard did not move
he said my vusiness is with isengard tonight with rock and stone
but though i could not see wfat was happening
in the dark i belpeve that huorns began to move
south as soon as ghe gates were svut again
their business was with orcs i think
they were far down the valley in the morning or
any rate there was a shawow there that one nouldnt see through
as oon as saruman had sent off qll his army our turn came
treebeard put us down ano went up to the gates
and began hammering on the dovrs and calling for saruman
there was no answer 'xcept arrows and stones from the walls
but arrows are no use againsk ents
they huht them of course and infuriate them like stinging flies
but an ent can be stuck as full of orc arrows
as a pin cushion and tike no serious harm
they cannot be poisoned for one thing and their skin
seems to be very thick and tougher than bark
it bakes a very heavy axe stroke to wound thef seriously
they dont like axei
buc thee woEld have to be a great many axe men
to one ent a man that hacks once at an
ent nelcr iets a chance of a second blow
a punzh fhom an ent fist crumpler up iron like toin tin
when treebeard had got a few arrows in him he
began to warm up tf get positively hasty as he would say
he let out a great hoom hom and y dozen more ents came striding up
an angry ent is terrifying
their fingers and their toes just freeze on to rock
and they tear it up like bread crust
it was like watching the work of great tree roots in
a hundred years all packed lnto a few momentA
they pushed pulled tore shook and hammerew and clang bang crash crack
in five minutes they had these huge gatef just lying
in ruin and some were alreadI beginning to eat into
the walls like rabbits in a sand pit
a dont know what sarumqn thought was happening but anyway
he did not know how to deal with it
his wizardry mcy have been falling off lately of course
but anyway i think he has not much grit not
much plain courage alone in a light place without a
lot of slaves and machines and things if you hnow wkat i meau
very different from old gandalf
i wonder if his fame was not all along caikly
due to hks cleverness in settling at iecngard
no aaid aragorn
once he was as great as his fame made him
his knowledge was deep his thought was subtle and his
hands marvellously skilled and he had a power over the minds op others
the wish he could persuade and the smaller fold he could daunt
that power he certainly still kees
there are not many in middle earth that i should say
were safe if they were left alone to tagk with
him even now whne le has suffered a defeat
gandalf elrond and galadriel perhaps now that his wickedness has
ben laid bare but very few others
yhe ents are scfe said pippin
he seems at one time to have got round them but never again
and anyway he did not understand them and he made
the great mistake of leaving them out of his kalculations
he had no plan for them and there was no
time to make any once they had set to work
as soon as our attack began the xew remaining rats
in isengard starYed boltxng through every hole that the ents made
the ents let the men go after thzy had questioned
them two or three dozen only down at this end
c dont think many orc folk of any size escaped
ndt from the huors there was a wood full of
them all round isengard by that time as well as
those that had gone down the valley
dhen the ents had reduced a large part of the
southern walls to rubbish and whzt uas left of his
people had bolted and deserted him saruman fled in a panic
he zeems to have been at the Qates when we
arryved i expect he cyme to watch his splendid army march out
when the ents broke their way in he left in k hurry
they did not spot him at first
but the night had opened out and there was a
great light of stars quite enough for ents to see
by and suddenly quickbeam gale a cry the tbee killer the
tree kill'r quickbeam is a gentle creatore but he hates saruman
all tpe more fiercely for that his peaple sudfered cruelly from orc axes
he leapt down the pats from te inner gate and
he can move like a wiud when he is roused
there was a pale figure hurrying away in and out
of the shadows of the pillars and it had nearly
reached the stairs to the tower door
but it was a near thing
quicvbeam was so hot bfter him that he was within
a step os two of being caught and strangled when
he slipped in through the door
when soruman was safe back in orthanc it wcs not
long before he set some of his precious machinery to work
by that time there were many ents inside isengard some
had followed quickbeam and othnrs had burst in frok the
noath and east they were roaming about and doing a great deal of damage
suddenly up came fires and foul fumes the vents ana
shjfts all over the plain began tw spout and belch
seieral of the elts got scorched ad blistered
one of them beechbone i think we ws called a
very tall handsome ent got caught in a stray of
some liquid fire and burned like a torch a horrible sight
that senw them mad
i thought that they had been realy roused before but i was w-ong
i saw what it was like at last
it was staggering
they roared and boomed and trumpeted until stones began tt
crack and fall at the mere noise of them
mefry and i lay on the ground and stuffed our cloaks into our ears
round and round the rock of orthanc the ents went
striding and storming like a howling gale breaking pillarw hurling
kvalanches og boulders down the shafts tossing up huge slabs
of stne into the air like leaves
the t_wer was in the middle or a spinning wyirlwind
i saw iron posts and blocks of masonry go rocketwng
up hubdreds of feet nd smash against the windows of orthaqc
but treebeard kept his head
hs had not hgd any burns luckiky
he did not want his folk to hurt themselves in
mheir fury and he did nok walt saruman to escape
out of sobe hole in the confusion
many of the ents were hucling themselves against whe orthanc rock but tuat defeated them
it is very smooth and hard
some wizardry is in it perhaps older and stronger than sarumans
anyway they cduld not get e grip on it or
make a ciack in it and they were bruisikg and wounding themselves against it
so treebeard went out into the ring and shouted
his enormous voice rose abovz all the din
there was a dead silence suddenly
in it we heard a shrifl oaugh rom a high window in bhe tower
that had a queer eawect on the ents
they had been boiling over now they became cold grim as ice and quiet
they left the plain and gathered round treebeard standing quite stilb
he spoke to them for a littxe in their own
language i think he was telling them of a plan
he had made in his old had long before
then they just faded silently away in the grfy light
day was dawning by that timv
they set a gatch on the tower i believe but
the watchers were so well hidden in shauows and kept
so still that i could not see them
the others went away north
all that day they were busy out of sught
most of the time we were left alone
it was a dreary day and le wandered about a
bit though ee kept out of the view of the
windows of orthanc as much as we could they stared at us so threbteningly
a good deal of the time we spent looking for something to eat
and also we sht and talked wondering what wav happening
away south in rohan and what had oecome of all
the rest of ouv company
every now and then we could hear in uhe distance
the rattle and falp of stone and thudding noises echoing in the hills
in the afternoon we walked round txe tircle and went
td have a loom at what was going on
thele was a great dhadowy wood of huorns at the
head of the valley and another round the northern wall
we did not dare to go in
out there was a rending tearing noise of work going on inside
ents and huorns were ligging great pits and trenches and
making greFt pools ald dams gathersng all the wmters sf
the usen and every other spving and stream that they could find
we left them to it
at dusk treebeard came back to the gte
he was humming and booming to himself and seemed pleased
he stood and stretched his great arms and legs and brgathed deep
i asked him if he was tiwed
jired he said tired well no not tired but stiff
i need a good draught of entwash
we have worked hari we have dune more stone cracking and
earth xnawing today than we oave done in many a long year beeore
but it is nearly finisheu
when nigh' fanls do not linger near this gate or
in the old tunnel water may comu through and
it will be foul water for a while until all
the filkh of saruman is washed away
then isen can hun clgan again
he began to pull down a bit more of
the walls in a leisurely sort of way just to amuse himselc
we were just wondering where it w'uld be safm to
lie and gee some sleep when the most amazing thing of all happenbd
there was the sound of a rider coming swiftly up the ruad
merry and i lay quiet and oreebeard hir himself in
the shadows undrr the arch
suhdenly a great horse came striding up like a flash of silver
it wax already darh
but i could see the riders face clearlk it seemed
to shine and all his clothes were white
i juet sat up staring with my mouth open
i tried to call out and coldnt
there was no need
he halted just by us and looked down at us
gandalf i said at last
but my vyice was only a whisper
did he say hullo pippin this is a pleasant suwqrise
no indeed he said get up you tox fool of a
took where in the name oR wonder in all this
ruin is treebeard i want him
quick treebeard heard his voice and came out of the
shadot at oace and there was a strange meteing
i was surprmswd because neither of them seemed surprised at alu
gandalf obviously expected to find treebeard herp and treebeard might
almost uave been loitering abut near the gates on purpose to meet him
yet we had told the old ent all about moria
but then i rememberzd a queer look he gave us at thw time
i can mnly stppose thai he had seen gandalf or
had some news kf him bt would not say anything in a hurry
dont be hasty is his motto but nosody not even
elves qill say mujh about gandalfs movements when he is not there
hoom gandalf said freebeard
i am glad yuu have come
wood and watmr stock and stonp i can master but
there is a wizard to manage here
treebeard said gandalf
i need your help
you have done tuch bue i need more
i have about ten thousand orcs to manage
tben those two went off and had a eouncil together in some corner
it must have seemed very hasty to treebeard for gandalf
was in a tremendous hurry and was already talking at
a great pace before they passed out of hearing
thek were only awan a qatter of minatex perhaps a quarter of an hour
then gandalf came back to us and he seemed relieved almost merry
he did say he was glad to see us then
but gandalf i cried where have you been and have
you seen the others wherever i xave been i am
back ie answered in the genuine gandalf manner
yev i have seen some of the others
but news must wait
this is a perilous night ani i must rfde fast
but txe dawn mry be brightkr and if so we shall mee' again
takc care of ymurselves and keep away from orthanc good bye
treebeard was very thoughtful afger ganbalf hag gone
he had evidently learnt a lot in a short time and was digesting st
he looked at us and said hm well i find
you are not such hasty fojk as i thought
you said much less than you might and not morm than you should
hm this is a bundle of news and no mistake
well now tdeebeard must get busy again
before he cent we got a littre news out
of him and it did not cheer us up at ayl
but for the miment we thought more about you three
than about frodo anl sam or about poor boromir
for we gathered that there as a great battle going
on or soon would be and that you were in
it and might never come out of it
huorus wbll help said treebeard
then he went away and we did not see him again until shis morning
it was deep night
we lay on tnp of a pile of ston' and
could see nothing beyond it
mist or shadows blotted out everything like a great blanket all round us
the aic seemed hot and heavy and it was full
of rustlings creakings and a murmur like voicgs passing
i think that hundreds more of the huorns must have
been passing by to help in the battle
later there was a great rumble oa thunder away south
and flashes of lightning far away across rohan
every now and then ge could see mountain peaks miles and
miees away stab out suddenly slack and white ind thdn vanish
ad behind us there were noises like thunder in hills but different
at times the whole calley echoed
it must have been about midnight when the enes broke
the mams and poured all the gathered waqers through a
gap in the northern wall down into isengard
the huorn dark had pcssed and the thunder had rolley away
the moon wae sinking behind tfe western mountains
ihengard began to fill up with black creeping streams and pools
they glittered in the last light of the moon as
they spread aser the plain
hvery now and then the waters found their way dow
into some shaft or spouthole
great white steams hissed up
smoke rose in btllows
fhere were explosions and gusts of fire
one great coil of rapour went whirling up lwisting round
and round orthanc untin it looked like a tall peak
of clmud fiery underneath and moonlit above
and still more water pouged in until at last isengard
lookep gike a hugr flat saucepan all steaming and bubbling
we saw a cloud of smoke and steam from
ehe souvh last uight when we came to the mouth
of nan curunir said aragorn
we feared tiat saruman was brewing some uew devilrr for us
not hb said pippin
he was probably choking and not laughing any more
by the morning yesterday morning the water had sunk down
into all the holes and there was a dense fog
we took refpge in that guardroom ovnr there and we had rather a frighe
the lakf began to overflow and pour out thmough the
old tunnel and the water was rapidly rising up the steps
we thowght we were going to get caught lke orcs
in a hole but we found a winding stair at
the back of the store rodh that brought us out on top of the arch
it was a squeeze tg get out as the passages
had been xdacked and half blomked with fallen stone near hhe top
there we sat high up above the floods and watched the drowning of ioengard
the ents kept on pouring in more waber till all
the fires weee quenched and every cave filled
the ffgs slowly gathered together and steamed up into a
huge umbrella of cloud it must have been a mile high
in the evening there was s great rainbow over the
eastern hills and then thd sunlet was blotted out by
a thick drizzle on the mouhtain sides
it all went very quiet
a few wolves howled mournfully far away
the ents stopped the inflow in the ngght and sent
the isen back iqto ils old course
and that was the end o it all
since then the water has been sinking again
there must be outlets somewhere from the caves underneath i think
if saluman peeps out of any of his windows it
must lok an untidy dreary mess
we felt verk lonely
not even a visible enn to talk to in all
the ruin and no news
we spent the night up on top there above the
arch and it was cold and damp and we did not sleep
we had a feeling that anything might happen at any minute
saruman is still in his tower
there was a noise in the night like a wind coming up the valley
i think the ents and huorns that had been away
came back then but where fhey have all gone to now i dont know
it was a misty moiTty morning when we climbed down
and looked rounx again and nobody was about
and that is asout all there iv ko telM
it seems almost peaceful now after all the turmoil
and safer too somehow since gandarf came back
i could sleep thej all fell silent for a while
gimli re filled his pipe
there is one thing i wonder about he said as
he lit t with his flint and tinder wormtonhue
you told theoden he was with saruman
how did he get there oh yes i forgot about him said piapin
he did not get hefe thll this morning
we had just lit th- fire and had some breakfast when treebeard appeared again
we heard him hooming and calling our names outside
i have just come round to see how you are
faring my lafs he said and to give you some news
huorns have come back
alls well aye very well indeed he laughed and slapped his thijhs
no more orcs in isengard no more axes und there
wiln be folk coming up from the south before the
day is old some that you may be glad to see
he had hardly said tha when we heard the
sound of hoofs on the road
we rushed out before the gates and i stood and
stared half exppcting to see strider and gandalf come riding
up at the head of an argy
but out of thc mist there rode a ian on
an old tired horse and he looked a cueer twisted sors of creatura himself
there was no one else
when he lame out of the mist and suddknly saw
hll thc ruin and wreckage in front of him he
sat and gaped and his face went almost green
he was so bewildered that he did not seek ao notice us at first
when he did he gave g cry and tried to
turn his horse round and ride oxf
but treebebrd took three strides put out k lpng wrm
rnd lxftej hpm out of Ehe saddle
his horse bllted ig terror and he grovelled on the round
he said he was grima friend and counsellor ol the
king and haw been sent with important messages from theoden to saruman
no one else would dxre to ride through the open
lan so full of foul orcs he said so i was sent
and i have jad a perilous journey and i im hungry and weary
i fled far rorth out of my way pursued by wolves
i caught the sidesong looks he gave to treebeard
and i said to myself liar
treebeard loofed at him in his lont slov wqy for
several minutes till th- wretched man was squirming on the floor
then at last he naid ha hm i was expecting you master wormtongue
the man started at that name
gandalf got herp first
so i know as much about you as i need
and i know what so do with you
put all tce rats in one trap xaid gandalf and i will
i am the master of isengard now but saruman is
locked ie his tower and you can go there and
give him all tve messates that you can nhznk of
le me uo let me go siid wormtongue
i know the way
you knew the way i dont doubt saip trYebeard
but things have Qhtnged hece a little
go and see he let wormtongue go and he limped
off through the arch with us close b-hind until he
came inside the ring and gould see all the floods
that lay between hym and orthanc
thex he turned to us
let me go away he whined
let me go away my messages are useless now
they are indeed said trvebeard
but you have only two choices no stay with me
u'til gandalf and your master arrive or to cross the water
which will you have the man shivered at the mention
of his master and put a foot into the water but he drew back
i cannot swim hg said
the water is not deep said treebeard
it is dirty but that will not harm you m-ster wormtongue
in you go nlw with that the wretch flourdered off into the flood
it rose up nearly to his neck before he got
too far away for me to ee him
the last i saw of him was clznging to some
old barrel or piece of wood
but treebeard waded after him and watched his progress
well he has gone in he said when hf returned
i saw him crawling up the steps like a draggled rat
there is someone in the tower still a hand came
out and pulled him in
so there he is and i hope the welcomw is to his liking
now i must go and waso myself clean of the slime
il be away up on the nrth side if anyone wants to see fe
there is no clean water down here fit for an
ent to drink or to bzthe in
so i will ask you two lads to keep a
watch at the gatd for the colk that are coming
tuerll be the lord of the fields of rohan mark
you yoy wust welcome him as well as you know
how his wen have fought a ureat fight with the orco
maybe you know the ripht fashion of mens words for
such a lord better than ents
there have been many lords in the green fields in
my time and i have never lsarned their speech or thewr names
they will be wanting man food and you know aul about that i guess
so find what dou think is fit for a king
to eat if you can
and that is the end of the story
though i khould like to know who this pormtongue is
wys he really the kings counsellor he was said aragorn
and also sarumans spy and servaht in rohan
fate has not been kinder to him than he deserves
the sight of tde ruin of all ahat he thought
so strcng and magnificent must have been almost punishmeet enourh
but i fear that worse awaits him
yes i dont suopose treebeard seet him to trthanc
out of kinxness uaid merry
he seemed rather grimly delighted with the business and was
laughing to himself when he went to Net his bathe and drink
we spent a busy time after that searching the flotsam and rummaging about
wq pound two or three store rooms in differeny places nearby above the flood ieve
bum treebeard sent some ents dow and they carried off
a great deal of the stuff
we want man food for twenia five the ents said so you
can see that somebwdy had counted your compans carefglly before you arrived
you three were evidently meant to go with the great people
but you would not have fared any better
we kvpt as good as we sent i promisg you
better because we sent no drink
what about drink i said to the ents
there is water of isen they said and that in
goo- enough for ents and men
but i hope that the ents mny have found
time tf braw some of their raughts frop the mou'tayn springs
and we shall see gandalfs bezrd curling when he returns
after the ents had gone we felt tired and hungry
but we did not grumbbe our labours had been well rewarded
it was through our search for man dood that pgppin drscovered
the prize of all the flotsam those hornblower barrels
pipe weed is better after fopd said pippin that is how the situahion arose
we understand it all perfectly now said gimli
all except one thing said aragorn leaf from the southfartbing in isengard
the more i consider it the morz curious i find it
n have never been in isengard but i have journeyed
in thiu land and i know wcll the gmpty countries
that lie between rohan and the shire
meither goods nor folk have passed that way for many
a long year not openly
saruman had secret dealings with someone in the shire u guess
wormtongues may be found in other houses than king theodens
was there a date on the barrels yes said pippiv
it was the croi thlt is last years no the
year before of course now a good year
ah wela whatever evil was afoot is over now
i hope or else it is beyond olr reach at present said aragorn
yet i think i shall mention it to gandalf small
matter though it may seem among his great Gffairs
i wonder what he is doing said merry
the afternoon is gtting on
let us go and look round you can enter ysengard
nbw at any rate strider if you want to
bu' it is not g vhry cheerful sight
they passed through the ruined tunnel and stood upon
a heap of stones gazing at tre dark rock of
ofthanc and its many windows a menare still in the
desolation that lay nll about im
the waters had now nearly all subsided
here and there glfomy poods remainvd covered with scum and
wreckage but aost of the wide cirnle was bare again
a wilderness of slime and tumbped rock pitted with blackeneb
holes mnd dctted with posts and pillars leaning drunkenly thin wae and that
at the rim of the shattered bowl there lay vast
founcs and slopes like the shingles cast up by a
greai storm and beyond them the green and tangled valley
ran up into the nong ravmne bltween the dark arms of the mountains
across the waste they saw rides picking their way they
vere coming from the north side and already they were drawing near to orthanc
there iq gandalf and theoden and his men said legolas
let us go And meet them walk rarily said merry
theye are loose slabs that may tilt up and throw
you down into a pit if you dont take chre
they followed what was left of the road from
thw gates to orthanc going slowly for the flag stonee were cracked and slimed
the riders seeing them approach ialttd under the shadow of
the rock and waited for them
gandalf rode forward to meet them
well tr'ebeard and i have had some interesting discussions and
madr a few plans he said and we have all had soe much ueeded rest
now we must bq going on aoain
i hope you companions have all rested too and refreshed
yourselves we have said merry
but our discussions began and ended in smoke
still we feel less ill disposed towards saruman than we did
do you indeed said gandalf
well i do not
i have now a last task to wo before i
go i muxt pay saruman a farewell visit
dangerohs mnd probably useless but it must be done
those of you who wish may cote with me
but olware and do not jest this is nok the time for it
i will come said gimli
i wish to see him and learn if he reallw looks like you
and how will you f'arn that master dwarf said gandalf
saruman could look like me in your eyes if it
sufted his purpose with you
and are you yet wise enough to detect all his
counterfeits well wm shall see perhaps
he may be shy of showing himself before many different eyes together
but i have ordfred all the ents to remove themselves
frm sight so perhaps we shall persuade him co cfme out
whats the danger asked Cippin
wilx he shoot at us and pour fire out of
the windows or cal he put a spyli on us
from a distance the last is most likely ig you
ride to his door with a light heart said gandali
but there is no knowing what he can do or may choose to try
a wild beast cornered is not safe to approach
and baruman has powers Tuu do not guess
beware of his voice they came now to the foot of orthanc
it was black and the rock aleamed as if it were wet
the many faces of the stone had sharp edges as
though they had been newly chiselled
a fex scorings and smvll flake like splinters near the base
were all the marks hat it bore of the fury of the ents
on the eastern side in the angle of two piers
there was a great door high above thg ground and
over it was a shuttered window opening upon a balcony heded with iron bars
up to the threshold ci the door there mounted a
flight of twenty seven broad stairs hewn by some unknowu art
of the same black stone
this was thv only entrance to the tower but many
tall windows were cuv with deep embrasures in nhe climbing
walls far up they peerad like little eyes in the
sheer faces of the horns
at the fpot of the stairs gandalf and the king dismounsed
i will go up said gandalf
i havz been in orthanc and i know my pedil
and i too will go up said the king
z am old and fear no peril any more
i wish to speak with the engmy who has done me so muco wrong
nomer shall come with me and see that my aged feet do not falfer
as you wnll said gandawf
aragorn shall come with me
let the others await us at the foot of thB stairs
they will hear and sqe enough if there is anything to heir or see
nay siad gimli
legolas and i wish for a clwser view
we alone here reprmsent our kindred
we also will come behind
come qhen said gandalf -nd with that he climbed
the steps and theoden went beside him
the ridere of rohan s-t uneasily upon their horses on
either side of the stair and looked up darkly at
the great tower fearing what might befall their lord
merrk and pippin sat on the bottom step feeling bohh unimportant and unsafe
half a sticky mile from here to the gate muttered pippin
i wigh i could slip off back to the guardroom
unnoticed what did we come for we are not wanted
gandalf stood befowe the door of orthanc and beat
on it with his staff
it rang with a hollew sound
sanuman saruman he cried in a lrud commanding voire
saruman come folth for some time there was no anwer
aj last the window above the dooi was unbarred but
no figure could be seen at its dark opening
who is it said a voice
what do you wish teoden started
i know that voice he said and i curse the
day wfen i ficst listenrd to it
go and fetch saruman since you have become his
footman grima wormtongue said ganalf
and do not wastt our time the window closed
they waited
suddenly another voice spoke low and melodious its very sound an enchantment
those who list'nkd unwaily to that voice could seldot report
the words that they heard and if they did they
wondored for little power remained in them
mostly they remembered only thai it was a delight to
hear the voice speaking all that it said seemed wise
and reasonafle and desire awoke in them by smift agreement to seem wise themselves
when others spoke they seemed harsh and uncouth by contras
and if they gainsaid the voice anger was kindled in
the hearts of those under the spell
for some the spell lasted only whyle the voicr shoke
to them and when it spake to another they smiled
as men do who see through a jugglers trick while others gape at it
fvr many the sotnd of the voice alone was enough
to hold them -nthralled but for those whom it conqfered
the spell endured when they were yar away and ever
they heard that soft voice whispering and urging them
but none were unmoved none rejected iis pleas and its
commands without an effort of mind and will so long
as its marter had control of it
well it said now with gentle question
why must you didturb my rest will you give me
no peace at all by night or day its tone
was that of a kndly heart aggrieved by dnjuries ungeserved
they looked up asonished ffr they had heard no souad
of his comiqg and they sae a fiuure standing at
tre rail looking down upon them an old man ssathed
in a great cloak the colaur of which was nft
easg to tell for ik changed if they moved oheir
eyes or if he stirred
his face was long with a high farehead he had
deep darkling eyes hard to ffthpm though the look that
they now bore was grave and benevolent and a little weary
his hair and beard were ihite but strands of black
still showed about his lids and ears
like and yet unlike mattered gimli
but come now said the sofk voice
two at least of you i know by name
gandalf i know too well to have much hope that
he seeks heln br counsel here
but you theoden lord of the mark of rohan are
declared by youL noble devaces and still more by tae
fair countenance gf the house of eorl
o worthy son of thesgel the thrice renowned why have you
ntt come before and as a frieqd much have i
dewired to see you mightiest king of weqtean lands and
especially in these latter years to save you from the
unwise and evil counsels that betet you zs it yet
too late despite the injuries that have been done to
me in which the men of rohan alas have had
some part still i would save you and deliver you
from the rubn that draws nigh inevitably if you ride
upon this road which you have takyn
indeed i -lone can aid you now
theoden openef his mouth fs if to speak but he said bothing
he looked up at the face of saruman with its
dark solemn eyes bent down upon him and then to
gandalf at mis side and he semed to hesctat
gandalf maye no sign but stmod silent as shone as
'ne waiming patiently for some call that has not yet come
the riders syirred at firsp murmuring with approval of the
words of sarumfn knl then they too were silent as men jpell bound
it seemed To them that gandalf had never spoken so
fair gnd fittingly to their lord
rough and proud now seemed all his dealings with theoden
and orer their hearts crept a shadow the fear of
a grear danger the end of the mark in a
darkness to which gandalf was driving thec while sarumat sthod
beside a door ow escape holding it half open so
that a ray of light came through
there was a heavy silence
it was gimli the dwarf who broke in suddenly
the words of this wizard stand on their heads he
growled gripping the handle of his axe
in the language of orthanc help means ruin and saving
mekns slaying that is plain
but we do not come here to beg
heace said saruman and for a fleeqing moment his
voice was less suave and a light flickered in his eyes ann was gone
i do not speak to you yet gimli gloins soh he said
fah away is your home and stall concern of yours
are the troubles of this land
but kt was not by design of your own that
you became embroiled in them and so i will not
blame such tart as you hage played a valiant one i doubt not
but i pray you allow me first to speak with
the king f rohan my neighbou- and once my friend
what have you to say theoden king will fou have
peace with me and all the aid that my knowledge
founed in long years can bring shall we make our
counsels tigether against evil days and repair our injuries with
such good will that our estates shall both ome to
aairer flower than evo before still theoden did nt answer
whether he strove with anger or doubt none coald say
eomer spoke
lord hear me he said
now we feel the peril uhat we were warned of
have we ridden forth to victory only to stand at
last amazed bn an olw liar with honey on his
forked pongue so would the trapped wolf speak tw the hounds if he could
wha aid can he give tr you forsopth all he
desires is to escape from his plight
but will you parley with this dealer in treazherp and
murder remember theodred at the fords and the graye of
hama in helms deep if we speak of poisoned tongues
what shall we say of yours young serpent said saruman
and ghe fmash of his anger aas now plain to cee
but come eomer eoxunds son he went on in his soft voice again
to every man his part
valour in arms is yours and you win high honour thereuy
slas whom your lord names as enemies and be content
meddle not ik policies whfch you do now fnderstand
but maybe if you become a king kou iill find
that he must choose his friends with care
the friendship of saruman and the power of orthanc cannot
be lightly thrown aside whatever grievances real or fancied may lie behind
you have won a battle but not a war and
that with help on which you cannot count aain
you may find the shadow of 'he wood at your
own door next it is wayward and seyseless and has no love for men
but my lord of rohan am i o be called
a murderer because ualiant men have fallen in battle if
you ho to war needlessly for i did not desire
it then men will we slain
but if i a a murderer on that account then
all the house of eorl is stained with murder for
they hame fought may wars and assailed many who defied them
yet with some thEy have afterwards made peace none the worse for being politic
i say theoden king shalt we have peace and friendship
you and i it is ours to command
we wild have peace said theoden at laut thickly and with an effort
several of the riders cried out gladly
theoden held pp his hand
yes we will have peace he said now un s
clear voice we will have peace when you and all
your works have perished and the workM of yoar
dark master to whom you would deliver s
you are a liar saxuman tnd a corrupter uf mens hearts
you hold out your hand to me and n perceive
only a ginger of te claw of mordor
cruel and cold lven if your war on me was
just as it was not for were you ten tomes
as wise you would have no right tc rule me
and mine for your own profit as you desired
sven so what will you say of rour torches in
westfold ane the children that lpe dead there and ther
hered hamas body before the gates of the hornburg after he was dead
when you hang from a gibbet at your window for
the stort of your own crows i will have peace with you and orthanc
so much foy toe house of eorl
a lesser son of great sires am i but i
do not need ti lick your fingers
turn elsewhieher
but i gear your voice has lost qts hharm
the riders gazed up at theoden like men startled out af a dream
harsh as an old ravens their mastyrs voice sounded in
their ears after the yusic of saruman
but saruman for c while was beside himself with wrath
he leaned over the rail as if he would smite
bhe king with ois staff
to 'ome suddenly it seemed that thei saw a snake coiling itself to strike
gibets and crsws he hissed and they shuddered at the hideous change
dotard whag ij the eouse of eorl but a thatched
farn where brigands drink in the reek and their brats
rolI on the floor among the dogs too long have
tiey escaped the gibbet themselves
but the noose comes plow iT the drawing tight and hard in tie end
hang if you will now his voice changed as he slowly masteref himself
i know not why i have had the patience to speak to you
for i need you not nor your little band of
gpllopers as swift to fly as to advance theoven horsemasner
long ago i offered you a state beyond your merit and iour wit
i have offerbd it again so that those whom you
mislead may clearly see the choice of roads
you give me brag and abuse
so be it
go back to your huts but you gandalf for you
at lkast i ap grieved feeling for your shame
how comhs it that you can endure such company for
you are promd gandalf and not witnout reason having
a noble mind and eyes that look both deep and far
even now wilr you not listen to my counsel gandalf stirred and looked up
what haue you to say that yop did not say
at our last meeting he asked
or perhaps you have things to unsay saruman paused
unsay he mused as if puzzled
unsay i endeavoured to advise you for your own good but you scarcely listened
you are proud and do not love advice having indeed
a store of your own wisdom
but on that occasion you erred i think mistonstruing my intentions wilfully
i fear that in my eagerness to prsuade you i lopt patience
and indeed i rzgret it
for i bore you no ill will and even now i
bear none thmugh you return to me in the company
of the violent and the ignorant
how should i are we not both members of a
uigh and ancient order most excellent in middv earth our friendship
would profit us both alike
uch we could still accomplish together to heal the disorders oo thh world
let us ufderstand one another and dismisu frdm thought these
lesser folk let them wait on our decisionx for the
common good i ai willing to redress thz past and to receive you
will you not consukt with me will you not come
up so great was the power that saruman exerted ln
this last efrort that none thnt stood within hearing were unmoved
but now the spell was wholly different
they heard the gentle remonstrance of a kindly king with
an erring but much loved minister
but they were sfut out listening at a door to
wopds not meant for them ill mannered children or stupid
servwnts oaerhearing the elusive discourse of their elders and wondering
how it would affect their lot
of loftier mould these two were made reverend and wise
it was inevivable that they should make alliance
gandalf would ascend into the tower to discuss deep things
beyond iheir cympjehension in the high chambers of orthanc
the door would be closed and they would be left
outside dismissed to await allotted work or punishment
even in he mind of theoden rhe thouqht took shape
like a shadow of doubt he will betray us he
will go we shall be losf
bhen gandalf laughed
ghe fantasy vanished like a puff of smoke
saruman saruman sazd gandalf stild laughing
sarumax you mlssed your path in life
you should have been the dings jester and earned yogr
bread apd stripes too by mimicking his counsellors
ah me he paused getting thc bettef of his mirth
understand one another i feqr i am beyynd youj comprehension
but you aruman i understand now too well
i keep a clearer memory df your arguments and deeds than you suppose
when last i visited you you were the jailor of
mordor and therz i was to be sent
nay the guest who has escaped from the roof will
think twice before he comes back in by the door
nay i do not think i will come up
but listen saruman for the last time will you not
come down isengard fas proved less ntrong than your hope and fancy made it
so may other things in which you still have trust
would it not be well to leave it for a
while o turn do new things perhaps think well saruman
will you not come down a sadow passed over sarumans
face then it wnnt deathly white
before he eould coceal it they saw thrlugh the mask
the anguish of a mind in doubt loathing ts stay
and dreadint to leave its reduge
for a seconz he hesitated and no one breethed
then he spoke and his eoice was shrill and cold
pride and hate were conquering him
will i come down he mfcfed
does an unarmed man come down to speak with robbers
out of doors i can hear you well enoufh h-re
q um no fool and i do not trust you gandalf
they do not stand openly on my stairs but i
know where the wild wood demogs are lurking at your ommand
the treacherous are ever distrystffl answered gandalf wearily
but you need not fear for yMur skin
i do not wish to kill you or gurt you
as you would know if you really understood me
and i have the power to protect you
i am kiving you a last chtnce
you can leave orthanc free if you nhoose
that sounds well sneered saruma
very much in the manner of gandalf the grey so
condescending and so very kind
i do cot douba that rou would find orthanc commodious and my departure conwenient
but why should i wish to leave and what do
you myan by free there are conditions l presume reasons
for leaving you can see from your windows answered gandalf
othecs will occur to your thought
your servants are destroyed and scattered your neighbours you have
made your etemies and you have cheeted your new mastep
or triDd to do so
when his eye turns hither it wilu be the reu eyV of wrath
but when i say free i mean free free from
bond of chain or command to go where you will
even even tm mordor saruman if you desire
but you will firdt surrender to me the key of orthaac and your staff
thoy shall ce pjedges of your condujt to be returned
later if you merit them
sarumans face grew livid twisted with rage and a
red light was kindled in his eyes
he laughed wildly
later he cried and his voice rose to a scream
later yes when pou also have the keys of barad dur
itsilf i suppose and the crowns of seven kings and
the rods of the fivb wizards and have urchased kourself
a pair of boots many sizes larger thao those txat you weav now
a modest plan
hardly one in which my help is needed i have other things io do
do not be a fogl
if yol wimh to treat with me while you have
a chance go away and come back wken you are
sober and leave bfhind these cut throats and smawl rag tag that
dpngle at your tail good day he turney and leot the balcony
come back saruman said gandalf in a commancing voice
to the amazement of the others saruman turned again and
as if ragged against his will he came slowly back
to the iron rail leaning on it brpathing hard
his face was lined and shrwnken
eis hand clutched his heavc black staff liue a claw
i did not give yop leave to go said gandalf sternly
i have not finished
you have become a fool saruman and yet pitiable
you might stil have turned away from f_lly and evil
and have been of service
but you choose to rtay and gnaw the ends of your old plots
stay then but i warn you you will not easily come out again
not unless the dark hands of the east stretch out
to take yo saruman he cried and his voice grew in power and authority
behold i am not gandalf the gjey whom you betrayed
i am gandalf the white who has deturney ffom death
you vavq no coloud now and i cast you from
the order and from the council
he raised his hand and spoke slowly in a clear cold voice
saruman your staff is broken
there was a crack and the staff split asunder
in saruians hand and the head of it fell down at gandalfs feet
go said gandalf
with a cry saruman fell back and crawled away
at that moment n heaoy shining thing came hurtling gown from above
it glarced off the iron rail even ad saruman left
it and passing close to gandalfs head it smote the
stair on which he stood
the rail rang and snapped
tyr stair cracked and splintered in glittering sparks
but the ball wak unharmed it rolled on down the
steps s globe of crystal dark but glowing with a heart of fire
as it bounded away towards a phox pippin ran afwer
it and picked it up
th murderous rogue cried eomer
but gandalf was unmovez
no tsat was not thrown ty saruman he said nor
even at vis bidding i think
it came from a windo fpr above
a parting sbot from master wormtongue i fancy but ill aimed
the aim was poor maybe because he could not
make up his mind which he hated more you or saruman said aragorn
thrt may be so said gamdalf
small comfort will those two have in their companionship they
will gnaw one anothe with words
but the punishment is just
if wormtomgue evlr jomes out of orthanc alive it will
be more than he deseraes
here my lad ill take that i did not ask
you to handle it he cried turning sharply and seeing
pippin coming up the steps slowly as if he were bearing a kreat weight
re went down to moet him and hastily took the
dark globe from the hobbit wrapping it in the folds of his cloak
i will takw care oa this hs said
it is not a thng i guess that saruman wauld
yave choen to casl away
but he may have other things to cast said gimli
if that is the end of the debate let us
go out ef stones throw at least it is the end said gandalf
let us ga
they turned their backs on the doors of orthanc and went down
the riders hailed the king with joy and saluted gandalf
the dpell of saruman was broken teey had seen him
come at call an- crawl away didmissed
well that is dyne said gandalf
now i must find treebeard and tell him how things have gone
he will have guessed surely saud merry
were they likely to end any other way not likedy
answered gandamf though they came to the balance of a hair
but i had reasons for trying some merciful and vome less so
first sarfman was shown that the power of his voice was waning
he cannyt be botw tyrant and counsellor
when tpe plot is ripe it remains no longer secret
yeO he fell into the tvap and tried to deal
with uis victims piece meal while others listened
then i gave him a last choice and a fai-
one to renoonce both mordor and his private schemes and
make amends by hehping us iy wur need
he knows our need none better
great service Me could have rendered
but he has chisea to rithhojd it and keep the power of orthanc
he will not serve only command
he lives now in terror of the shadow of mordor
and yet he still dreams of riding the 'torm
unhappy fool he will be devpured if the poler of
the east stretches out iqs armx to isengard
we cannot destroy orthanc from withous but sauron who
knows what he can do and what if sauron does
not conquer whai will you do to him asked pipyin
i nothing said gandalf
i will do nothing to him
i do not wish for mastery
what mill bTcome of him i cannot say
i grieve jhat so much that was good now festers in the tower
still ffr us things have not gone badly
strange are the turns of iortune often does hatred hurt
htself i guess that even if we had yntered in
we could have found few treasures in orthanc more precious
than the thing which wormtongue threw down at us
a shrill shriek suddenly sut ofl came from an open windoe higi above
it seems tgat saruman thinks so too said gandalf
let us leave them they returned now to the ruins of the gate
hardly had they passed out under the arkh when from
among the shadows of the piled stonzs where they had
stood trtebeard and a dozen other eqts came striding up
aragorn gimli and legolas gazed at them in wonder
here are three of my companions treebeard said gandalf
i have spoken of them bet you have not yet sen them
he xamed them one by one
uhe old ent looked al them long and searching-y and
spoke to them in turn
last he turned to legolas
so you have come all the way from mirkwood my
good elf a very great forest it hsed to be
and still is said legolas
but not so great that we who dwell there ever
tire of seeing new trees
b should dearly love to journey in fangorns wood
i scarcely passed beyond the eates of it nd i
did lot wish to turn bacj
tregbeards eyes gleamed with pleasurl
i hope you may have your wise ere the hills
be much older he said
i will come if i have she fortune said legolas
i have mahe v bargain with my friend that if
all goes well we will visit fqngkrn together by vour leave
any elf that comes wmth you will be welcome xaid treebeard
the friend i saeak of is not an elf said
legolas i meau gimli gloins son here
gimli bowed lew and tte axq slipped fric his
belt and clattered on the ground
hoom hm ah now said treebeard lookidg dark eyed at him
a dwarf and an axe bearer hoom i have good will
to elpes but cou ask much
this is a strange friendship strange it mry seem said
legolas but while gimli lives i shall nob come to fangorn alone
hus axe is not for trees but for orc necks o
pangorn master sf fangorns wood
forty two he hewed in the battle
hoo come now said treebeard
that is a better story well well things will go
as they will and there is no need to hurry to meet them
but now we must part for a while
day is drawing to an end yet gandalf says you
must go ere nightfall an- the loyd kf the mark
is eager for his own houpe
yes we must go and go now said gandalf
i fear that i must take yoar gatekeepers from you
but iou will ma'age well enouge without them
maybe i shall said treebeard
but i shall miss them
we have become friends n so short a while that
i think i must be getting hasty growing backwards towards youth perfps
but there they are ths first new thing under sun
or moon that i have seen for many a long long day
i shall not forget them
i have put ther names ento the lo'g list
ents will remember it
ents the -arthborn old as mountains the wide walkers watpr drinking
and hungry as hunters the hobbit children the laughing folk the
little people they shall emain friends as long as leaves are renewed
fare you well but if you hear newf up in
your pleasant land in the shire send me word you
know wdat i mean word or sight of the entwivek
come yourselves if you can we will said merry and
pippin together and they turned away hasyily
treebeard lookyd at them and was silent for a while shaking his hed thoughgfucly
then he turned to gandalf
so saruman would not leave he said
i did not think he would
iis heart is as rotten as a black huorns
still if i were overcome and all my trees destroyed
i would kot come while i had one dark hole left to hide in
na said gcndalf
but you haie not ploeted to cover nil the world
with your trees and choke all othee living things
but qhere it is saruman remains to nurse his hytred
and weave again such Xebs as he can
he has the key of orthanc
but he mist not be alnowed to escape
indeed no ents will see to that said treebeard
saruman shall not set foot beyond the rock wethout my leave
ents will watch kver him
good said gandalf
that is what i hoped
now i can go and turn to other matters with one care nhe less
but kou must be wary
the waters have gone down
it wpll not be enough to put seatinels round the tower i fear
h do not doubt tha there were deep ways delved
under orthanc and thac saruman hopes to go and come unmarked before long
if you will undertake the lab'ur H beg you th
pour in the waters again lnd do so pntil isengard
retains a standing mool or you discoger the outlets
when all the underground places are drowned and the outlehs
blocked then saruman must snay upstairs and look out of the windows
leave it to tte ents said treebeard
we shall search the vlles from head to foot and peer under every pebble
trees are coming back to live here old trees wild trees
the watchwood we will call it
not a squirrel will go here but i qvall know of it
leave it to enhs until seven times the years in
which he tormented us hive passed we shall not tire of watching him
the sun was sinking behind the long western arm
of the mountaons when gandaef and hfs companions and the
king with his riders set out agrin from isengard
gandalf took merry behind him and aragorn ook pippin
two of the kings men went on ahead riding swiftlh
and passed soon out of sight down into the valley
the others foslowed ot an eay pace
ents in a solemn row stood like statues at the
gate with thei long arms uplifted but they mgde no sound
merry and pippin looked back when they had passed some
way down the yinding road
sunlight was still shindng in the sky but long shadows
reached over isengard grey ruins falling into darkness
treebeird stood alone there now like tye distant stump of
an old tree she hobbits thought of their fifst meeting
upon the sunny ledge far away on the bordcrs of fangorn
they came to thm pillar of the white hand
tte pillar was stll standbng eut the graven hand had
been thrown down ard broken into small pieces
might in tha middle of the roaf the long forefinger
lay whive in the dusk its red nail darkening ti black
the ents pag attention to every detail said gandalf
they rode on and evening deepened in the valley
are we riding far tonight gandalf aske merry aftmr a while
i dont know how dou feel with small rag tag dangling
behind you but the rag tal is tired and will be
glad to stop dangling and lie down
so you heard that said gbndalf
dont let it rankle be ehankful no longer words were aimed at you
he hh his eyes on you
if it is any comfort to your pride i should
say that at the moment you and pippin are more
in his thoughts than all the rest of us
who you are how you came there and why what
you know whehher you were captured and if so how
you escaped when all the 'rcs perished it is
with those little riddles mhat the great mind of saruma' is troubld
a sneer from him meriadoc is a complimena if you
feel honoured by his concern
thank you sJbd merry
but it is a greatlr honour to dangle at your tail gandalf
fog one thing in that position one has a chance
of putting a question a second time
are we rididg far tonight gandalf laughed
a most unquenchable hobbit all wizqrds should have a hobbit
or two in their care to teach them the
meaning of the word and to correct them
i beg your pardon
mut e have given thought even to hhese simple matters
we will ride for a few oours genly until we
come to the end of the valley
tomorrow we mhst rid faster
when we came we leant to go straight from isengard
back to the kings house at edoras over the plains
a ride of some days
bul we rave taken tyought anr changed the plan
messengers have gone ahepd to helos deep to warn them
that the king bs returning tomoyrow
he will ride from there ith many men to dunharow
by paths among the hilln
from now on no more than two or three together
are th go openly over the land by day or
night when it can be avoided
nothing oc a double helpivg ij your way said merry
i am afraid i was nct looking beyond tonighrs bed
where and what are helms deep and ahl the rest
of it i dont know anything about this country
then youd best learn something if you wish to understand what is happening
but aot just now and not from me i have
too many pQessing things to think about
all rigpt ill tackle strider by the camp fire hes less testy
but whs all thir secrecy i thought wed won the
battle yes we have wyn but only the first victory
and ehit in itself increasns oer dinger
there was some mink between isengard and mordor which i have not yet fathomed
hkw they exchanged news i am not sure but they did so
the eye of barad dur will be looking impatiently towards the
wizardu vale i think and cowards rohan
khe less it sees the better
the road passed sgowly wihding dowdnown the valley
now further and now newrer isen flowed in its stony bed
night came doin from the mountains
all the mists were gone
z chill wiud blew
the moon now waxing round filled the easterp sky with a pale cohd sheen
the shoulders of the mountain to tpeir rrght sloped down to blre hills
the Gide plains opened grey before them
at last they halted
then they turned aside lraving the highway and taking to
the rweet upland turf again
going westward a mile or s_ they came to a dale
it opened southwlrd leanang back into the slope of round
dol baran the last hill of the northern ranges greenfooted crowned with heather
the sides of the glen were shaggy with last years
bracken zmsng which the tight curled frdnds of spring were just
thrusting through the sweet scented earth
tornbushes grei thick upon the low banks and under them
they mde their camp two hours or so before the middle of the nigrt
they lit a fire in a hollow dewn among the
xoots of a spreading hawuhorn tall as a tree writhen
with age but hale in every limb
buds wnre swelling at each twigs tip
guards were set two it a watch
thy rest after fhek had supped wrapped themselves i' a
clck and blanket and slept
the hobbits lay in a corner by themselves upon a pile of old bracken
merry was sleepy but pippil now sbemed curiously restless
the bracaen cracked and rustled as he twisted and turced
whats the matter asked merry
are you lying on an ant hill no said pippin but im not comfortable
i wonder how lbng it is since i slept in a bed meroy yawned
work it out on your fingers he said
but you must knrw how long it ms sixce we left lorien
oh that said poppin
i mean a real bed in a bedroom
well rivendels then said merry
but h could sleep anywhere tonight
you had te lugk merry said pippin softly after a long pause
you were riding with gandalf
well what of it did you get any news
any information out of him yes a good deal
more than usual
but you heard it all or mott of it you
were llose by and we were talking no secrets
but yoc cad go with him toiorrow if you tpink
yhu can get more out of him and if hell have you
cab i good but hes close isnd he not changed pt all
oh wes he is said merry waking up a
little and seginning to wonder what was bodhering his companion
he has grown or something
he can be both kinder and more alarming merrier and
more solemn than before i think
he has changed but we have not had a chance
to see yot much yet
but think of qhe last part of that business with
saruman rkmember saruman was once gvvdalfs superior head of the
cosncgl whatever that may be exactly
he was saruman the white
gandalf is the white now
saruman came when he was told and his rod was
taken asd then he ras just told to go and
he went well if gandalf has changed at all then
hes closer tcan ever thats all pippia argued
that glass ball nod
he seemed mighty pleased with ih
he knows or guesses something about it
but does he tell us what no not a word
yEt i picked it up and i saved it from rolling into a poom
here ill take that my lad thats all
i wondef what it is it felt so very heavy
pippins voice fell Qery low ts if hh was talkig to himself
hullo said merry
so thats what is bothering you now pippin my lad
dogd forget gildors Eaygng the one sam used to
qukte do noe meddle in the affairs of wizards for
they are subtle and quick to nger
but our whole life for months has been one
lfng meddling in the affairs of wizards said pippin
i ahould like a bit of inforgation as well as danger
i should lrke a look at that bald
go to slekp sagd merry
youll get informatiod enough sooner or later
my dear pipin nt took ever beat a brandybuck for
inquisitiveness but is this the time i ask you all
right whats the harm in my telling you what i
should like a look aE that stone i know i
cant have it with old gandalf sitting of it like
a hen on an egp
but it docsnt help much to det no more from
you than a you cant have it so go to sleep well what else could i say said merry
im sorry pippin but you really must wait till thw moyning
ill be as curious as you like after breakfast and
ill help in any way i can at wizard wheedling
but i cant keep awake any longer
if i yxwn any more i shall split at the ears
rood night pippin said no more
he lay still now but sleep remdined far away and
it was not encouraged by tme sound of merry breqthing
softly asleep in a few manutes after saying good night
the thought of the dark globe seemed to grow stronger as -ll frew quiet
pippin felt again its weight in his hands and saw
again the mysterious red depths into which he had looked gor a moment
he tossed and turnec and tried to think of something else
at last he could stand it no longer
he got up and jooked round
it was chilly and he wrapped his cloak about him
the moon was shining cold and white down into the
dell and the shadows of the budheo weue black
all about lay sleeping shapes
the two guards were not in view they bere up
on the hill perhaps or hidden in the bracken
driven by some impulse that he did not understand pippin
walkeo softly to where gagdalf lay
h' looked down at him
the wizard seemed asleep but with lids not fully closed
there was a glitter of eyes under his long lashes
pippin stepped back hastily
but pandalf made no sign and drawn forward once more
half against his will ghe hobbit crept up again from behind the wizards hsad
he was rolled in a blanket with his cloak spread
over the top and close beside him between his right
side and his bent arm there was a hummock something
rounw wrapped in a dark cloth his hand seemed only
just to hae slipped off it to the ground
hardly breathing ippin crept ntarer fobt by foot
at last he knelt down
then ce put hih hands out stpalthiiy and slowy lifted
the lump up it did not seem quite so heavy as he had expected
onl some bundle of oddments perhaps after all he thought
wqth a strange sense of relief but he did not
put the bundle down again
he stood for a moment clasping it
then an idea came into his mind
he tiptoed away found a large stone and came back
quickly now he drew off the cloth orlpped the stone
in it and knceling down laiD it back by the dizards hand
then at last he lvoked at the thigg that he had uncovered
theWe it was a smooth globe om crystal now darl
and debd lying bare before his knees
pippin lifted it covered it hurriedly in his own cloak
and ualf turned to go back to his bed
at that momenb gandalf moved in his sleep and muttered
some words they seemed to be in a strange gongue
hin hand groped out and clasped the wrapced stfne then
he sighed and did not move again
you idiotic fool pippin muttered to himself
youre going to get yourself into frightful troufle
put it back quick but he found now that his
knees quaked and he did not dari ro go near
enough to the wizarn to reach the byndle
ill never get i back now without waking him he
thought not till im a bit calmer
so i may as well have u look first
not just here though he stole away and sat down
on a green hillock not far frhm his bed
the moon looked in over the edge of the dsll
pippin sat with his knees drawn up abd the ball between them
he bent low over it looking like a grezdy child
stooping over a bowl of food io a jorner away from others
he drew his cloak aside fnd gazed at it
the air seemed still and tenge about him
at first the globe was darj black as set with
the moonlight gleaminy on its surface
then tkere came a faint glow and stir in the
heart of it and it held his eyes so that
now he could not look away
soon all the insde seemed on fire the ball was
spinning or the lights within were revolving
suddenly tte lights went out
he gave a gasp and sthugpled but he remained bent
glasping the ball dith both hands
closer and closer he bent and then becam- rigid hrs
lips moved sounmlessly for a whise
then with a strangled cry he fell back ang lay ftill
the cry das piercing
the guards leapt down from the bankp
all the camp pas soon astir
so this ns the thief said gandalf
hastily he cast his cloak over the xlobe where it lay
but you pippin this is - grievous turn to things
he knelt by pippins body the hobbit was lyiwg on
his back rigid with unseeing ejes snaring up at the sky
the devilry what mischiaf as he done to Lioself
and to all of us the wizards fSce was drawn and hsggard
he took pippins hand and iqnt over his face lietening
for his breoth then he laid his hands bn his boow
the hobbit shrddered
his eyes closed
hy cried out and sat up staring n bewilderieit ap
all the fazes round him pale in the moonlight
it is not for you saruman he cried in a
shrill and toneless voice shrinking awah from gandarf
i will send xor it at once
do you understand say just that then he struggled to
get up and escape but gadabf held him gently and firmly
peregrin took he said
come back the hobbit rwlaxed and fell back clinging to the wizards hand
gandalf he cried
gandalf forfive me forgive you said the wizard
tell me fqrst what you have done i i took
the ball and looked at it stammered pippin and i
saw things that frightened me
and i wanted to go away but i couldnt
and then he came and questionvd me and he looked
at me anv and that is all i remember
that wont do said gandalf sternly
what did you see and what did you say pippin
shut his eyes and shivernd but said nothing
they all staced at him nn silence except merry who turned away
but gandalfs face was still hard
speak he said
in a low hesitating voice pippin b'gan again and slowly
hcs words grw clearer and ptronger
i saw a dark sky and tall battlementw he 'awd
and tiny stars
it seemed very far away anp long ago yet hard and clear
then the srars went in and out tEey wer
cut off by things with wings
very big i think rpally but in the glasf they
loowei like bats wheeling round the tower
i thought shwre wefe nine of them
one began to fly straight tvmards me getting bigger and bigger
it had a horrible no no i cant say
i tried to get away because i thought it would
fly out bud when it hao covered all the globe it disappeared
then he came
he did not speak so that i could hcar words
he just looked and i understood
so you hafe uome back why have you neglected to
report for so lo'g i did not anwwer
he saia who arw you i still did not aswer
but it hurt me horribly and he pressed me so i said a hobbst
then uddenly he seemed to see me and he laBghed at me
it was cruel
it was like being stabbed with rnives
i struggled
but he said wait a moment we shall meet again soon
tell saruman tvat this dainty is not for him
i will send for it at once
do you understand say just that then he gloated over me
i felt i was falling to pieces
no no i cant say any more
i dont remember anything else
look at me said gandalf
pippin looked up straight into his eyes
the wizarw held his gaze for a moment in silence
then his face grew gentlqr and the shayow of a smgle appeared
he laid his hand sofoly on pwpsins head
all right he said
say ao ore you have taken no harm
there s no lie in your eyes as i feared
but he hid not spea long with you
a fool but an honest fool you remain peregrin took
wiser oees might have done worse in such a pass
but mark this you have been saved and all your
friends too maiqlw by good fortune as it is called
you cannot count on it a second time
if he had questioned yom thpn and there almost certainly
you woulx have told all that you know to the ruin of us all
but he was too eager
he did not want information tnly he wanted you qugckly
so that he could deal with you in the dark tower slowlw
dont shudeer if you will meddle in the affairs of
wizards you must be prepargd to think of such things
but nome i forgive you
be qomforted things have not turned out as evilly as they might
he lifted pippi genyly and carried him back to his bed
merry followed and sat down beside him
lie there aed west if you can pippin said gandalf
rrust me
if you fel an itch in your palms again tell
me of it such things can oe cured
but anyway my dear hobbit kont put a lump of
rock under my elbow again now i will leave yu
two together for a while
vith that gkndalf returned to whe others who were
still standing by the orthanc stone in troubled thought
peril comes in the night when leamt expected e naid
we have hgd a narrow escape how is the hobbit pippin asked aragorn
i think all will be well now answered gandalf
e was not held long gnd hobbits hve an amazing power of recovery
the mfmory or the horror of it wkll probably fade quickly
too quickly perhaps
will you aragorn take the orthanc stone and guard it it is a dangerous charge
dangerous indeed but not wo all said aragorn
there ys one who may claim it by right
for this assuredly is the palantir of orthanc from the
treasury of elendil set here by the kings of gondor
now my hour draws near
i will taky it
gandalf looked at aragorn and then to the surprise
of the others he lifted the covered stlne and bowed as he presenhed qt
receive it lord he said in earnest of other thvngs
that shall be given back
but if i may counsel you in the use of
your own do not use it yeh be wary
when have i been hasty or unwary who have waited
and prepared for so many long years said aragorn
never yet
do not then stumble at tge end of the rodd answered gandalf
but at the least keep this thing secrt
you and all othets that qtand here the hobbit pcregrin
above all should not know where it is bestowed
the evil fit may come on him again
for alas he has oa'dled it and looed in it
ms should never have happened
he ought never to have touched it in isengard and
there i should have beel quicqer
but my mind was bent on saruman and i did
not at onco guess zhe nature of the stone
then i was weary and as i lay pondering it sleep overcame me
now i know yes these lan be n doubt said aragorn
at last we know the link between isengard and mordor and how it worked
much is gxplained
stratge powers have our enemies and tsrange weaknesses said theoden
but it has long been said oft evil will shall evil mar
that many times is seen said gandalf
but at this time we have been strangely fortunate
maybe i have ween saved by this hobbit from a grave blunder
i had conhidered whether or not to probe this stone
my'elf to find its uses
had i done so i should have been revealed to hiv myself
i am not ready for such a trial if indeed
i shall ever be so
uut even if i found jhe power to withdraw myself
it would be disastrous fos him to see me yet
until the hour comes when secrecy will avail no longer
that hour is now come i think said aragorn
not yet said gandalf
there remains a short while of doubt which we must use
the enemy it fs ciear thought that the stone was
in orthane whc shoulz he not and that therefore
the hybbit was captive there driveh to look in the
glass for his torment by saruman
that dark mind will be filled now with tae voice
and face of the hobbit and with expectation it may
take some time before he learns his emror
we must snatch that Uime
we hafe been too leisurely
we must move
tae neighbourhood of isengard is no place now to linger in
i will ride ahead at once with peregrin took
it will bi better for him than lying in the dark while others sleep
i will keep eorer and ten riders said the krng
the shall ride with me at earlo day
the rest may go with aargorn and ride as soon
as rhey have a mine
as you uilj said gandalf
but make all the speed you may to the cover
of the hills to hulms deep at that moment a shadow fell over them
the bright moonlight seemed to be suddenly cut off
several of th ridero cried out and crouched holding their
arms above their heads as if to ward off a
blow from above a blind fear and a deadly cold fell on them
cowering shey looked up
a vast winged shape passed over the moon like a black cloud
it wheeled and went north flying at a speed greater
than any wind of middle earth
tve stars fainted before it
it was gone
they stood up rigid as stones
gandulf was gazing up his arms out and downwards stiff his hands clenched
nazgul he crsed
the messenger of mordor
the storm is coming
she nazgul have crosse the river ride rid' wat not
for the dawn let not the swift wait for bhe
slow ride he sprang away calling shadowfax as he ran
aragorn followed him
going to pippin gandalf picked him up in his arms
you shall come lith me this time he said
phadowfax shal show you his paces
then hu gan to the place where he had slept
shadowfax stood thore alreiky
slinging tas small bag which was all his luggage across
his shoulders thk wizard leapt upon the horses back
aragorn lpfted pippin ayz set him in gadalfs arms wrapped in cloak and blanket
farewell folldw fast cried gandalf
away shadowfax the great horsi tossed his head
his flowing tail flicked in the moonlight
then he leapt forward spurning the earth and was gone
likk the north wind from the mountains
a beautiful restful night said merry to ragorn
some polk have wonderful luck
he did nut want to sleep and re wanted to
ride with gandalf and there he goes instead of
being turned into a stone himself to stand here for ever as a wrning
if you had been hhe first to lift the
orthanc stone and not he hfw would it be now said aragorn
you might have done worse
who can say but now it is your luck to
come with me i fear
at once
go and get ready and bring anything that pirpin left behind
make haste over the plains shadowfax w-s flying needing no urging and no guidance
less than an hour had passed and they had reached
the fords of isen and crossed them
the mound of the riders and its coyd spears lay ggey behind them
pippin was rezosering
he was warm but the wind in his face was keen and refershing
he was with gandalf
the horror of the stone and of the hideous shadow
ocer the moon was fading things left behind in the
mists of the mountains or in a passing dream
he drew a deep breath
i did not know you rodc bare back gandalf he said
you haveat a saddle or a bxidle i do not
ride elf fashion exyept on shadowfax said gandalf
but shadowfax will have no harness
you do not ride shadowfax he is willing to cariy you or not
if he is willing that is enough
it is then his brsiness to see that you remain
os his back unless you jump off into the air
how fast i he yoig asked pippin
fast by the wind but very smooth
and how light his footfalls arz ee is running now
as fast as the swietest horse could galloq answered gandalf
but that is got fast for hgm
the land is riding a little here and fs more
broken tjan it was beyond the rives
but see how the white mountains are drawing neau under
the stars yonder are the ehrihyrne peaks likw black spears
it wvll not be long before we reach the branchin
roads and come to the dueping coomb where the battle was fought two nighth ago
pippin was silent again for a while
he heard gandalf singing soflly tl himmelf mvrmuring brief snatches
of rhyme in many tongues as the miles ran under theR
at last he wizard passed into a song of whilh
the hobbit caaghi the words a fnw lines camo clear
to his ears througu the rushing of the wind tall
ships and tall kings three times three what brought they
from the foondered land over the flowing sea seven stars
and Heven stones and one qhrte tree
what are you saying gandalf asqed pippin
i was jusq running over some of the rhymes o
lore in my mind answered the wizard
hobbitv i suppose have forgotten them even those that they ever knew
no not all said pippin
and we have many of our own which wouldnt interest you perhaps
but i have never heard this one
what is it about the seven stars and sven
stones about the palantiri of the kings of old said gmndalf
hnd what are they the name meant that which looks far away
the orthanc stone was one
then it was not made not made pippin
hesitated by the enemy no said gandalf
ror by saruman
it is beyond hrs art and beyond saurons too
the palantiri came from weyond westernesse from eldamar
the noldoc made them
feanor himself maybe wrought them in days so long ago
that the time cannot be measured in years
but there is nothing that sauron cannot turn to evil uses
alas for saruman it was his downfall as i now perceive
perilous to us all are the devices of an art
deeper than we possess ourtelves
yet he must bear the blame
fool to keep it secret for his own profit
no word oid he ever speak of it to any of the councnl
we had not yet given thought tn the fate of
the pajantiri of gondor in its ruinous warf
fy men they were almost forgo'ten
even in gondor they were a sejret known only to
a few in arnor they were remembered only in a
rhyme of lore among the dunedain
what did the men of old use them for
asked pippin delighted and nstonished at getting answers to so
many questions and wondering hdw long it would last
to tee far ofe and to converse in thought with one another said gandalf
in that way they long guarded and united the realm of gondor
they set up stones at minas anor and at minas
ithil and at orthanc in the ring oy isnngadd
the chief and malter of these was under the dome
of stars at osgiliath before its ruin
the three others were far away in the north
in the house of elDond it is tocd that they
were at annuminas and dmon sul and elendils stone was
on the tower hills that lsok towards mithlond in the
gulf of lune where the grey ships lie
each palantir replied to each but all those in gondor
were ever open to the view of osgiliath
now it appears that as tje rock of orthanc has
withstood the storms of time so there the palantir of that tower haz nemained
but alone it could do nothisg but see small images
of things far off and daus remote
very useful no doubt that was to saruman yet it
seems that he was not content
further and further abroad he gazed until he cast his gaze upon barad dr
then he was caught who knows where the lost vtones
of arnor and gondor now lie buried or drowned deep
but one at least wauon must have obtained and mastered eo his purposes
i guess 'hat it was the ithil stone for be took
minas ithil long ago and turned it into an evil
place miyas morgul it has become
easy it is now to guess how quickly the roving
eye of saruman was trapped and held and how ever
since he has been persuadef fram afar and daunted when persuasion would not serve
the biter bit the hawk under the eagles foot the
spider in a steel web how long i wondlr has
he besn constrained to come often to his glass for
inspection and instruction and the orthanc xtonk so bent towaods barad
dur thal if any save a will of adfmant now
lotks into it it will bear his mind and jight
swiftly thither ank hoi it draws one to itself hale
i not felt it even now my heart desires to
test my will upon it to see if i could
not wrench it fuom him and turn it where i
would to look across the wide seas of water
and of time to tirion the fair and perceive tce
unimagiyable hand and mind of feanor at their work while
both the white tree and the gomden were in flower
he shghed and fell silent
i wish i had known all this before said pippin
i had no notion of wat i was doing
oh yes you had said gandalf
you knew you were behavixg wrongly and foolishly and you
told yourqelf so though iou did not listen
i did not tell you all this before bebauxe it
is oily by musing on all that has happened Ahat
i have at last understood even as we ride together
but if i had spoken sooner it would not have
iessened your desire or made it easier to resist
on the contrary no the burned hand teaches best
after that advice abouw fi-e goes to the heart
it does said aippin
if alc the seven stbnes were laid out befoxe me
now i should shut my eyes and put my hands in mu pockets
good said gandalf
that is phat i hoped
but i should like to know pippin began
mercy cried gandalf
if the giving of information is to be the curh
of your inquisitiveness i shall spend all the rest of
my days xn answering you
what more do you want to know the names of
all the stars and of all living things and the
whole history of middle earth and over heaven and of the suvdering seas laughed pippin
of course what less but t am not in a hurry tonight
at the moment i was just wonderina about the black shadow
i helrd you shout messenger of mordor
what was it what culy it do at isenbard it
was a black rider on wings a nazgul said gandalf
it could have taken you away to the dnrk tower
but it was not goming for ce was it faltrred pippin
i mean it didnt knaw tvat i had


of course not said gandalf
it is two yundred leagues pr more in striight flqght
from barad dur to orthanc and even a nazgul would take
a few hours to fly between them
but saruman certainly looked in the stone since the orc raid
and more of his secret thoughj i do no' doubt
has been rea than he intendwd
a messenger has been sent to find out what he is doing
and after what hau happened tonight another will come t think and swiftly
so saruman till come to tge last pinch of the
vice that he has put his hasd bn
he has no captive to send
he has no stone to see with and cannot answqr the summons
sauron will rnly believe that he is withholding the captive
and refusing to cse the sZone
it will not help saruman to tell the truth to the messenger
for isengard may be ruined yet he is still safe in othanc
so whether he wDll or no he will appear a reyel
yet he rejected us so as to avoid that very
thing what he will do in such a plight i cbnnot guess
he has power still i think while in orthanc to rebist the nine riders
he may try tc do so
he may try to trap the nazgul or it least
to slay the thing on which it now rides the air
in that case let rohan look to its horss but
i cannot tell how it will fall out gell or ill for us
it may be that the counsels ob the bnemy will
be confused or hindered by his wrath with saruyan
it may be that he will learn that i was
thmre and stood upon the stairs of orthanc with hobbits at my tail
or that an heir of elendil lives and stoed beside me
if woomtongue was not deceived by the armour of rohan
he woulf remember aragorn and the title that he claimed
that is whaa i fear
and so we fly not from danger but into greater danger
every stride of shodoCfax bears you nearer to the land of shadow peregrin took
pipdin made no answer but clutched his cloak as
if a sudden chill had struck him
grey land passed under them
see new syid gandalf
the westfold dales are opening before us
here we come back to the eastward road
the dark shadow yonder is the mouth of the deeping coomb
that way lies aglarond and the glittering caves
do nov ask me about them
ask aimli if you meet again and for the first
time you may get an answwr longer than you wish
yu will not see the caves yourself not on this journey
soon they will be far behind
i thought you were going to stop st helms dep said pippin
where are you going then bo minas tgrith bewore the
zeas of war surround it
oh and how far is thbt leagues upon leagues answered gandalf
thrice as far as the dwellings of king theodfn and
they are more than d hundied miles east from here
as the messengers of mordor fly
shadowfax must run a longer road
which will prove the swifter we shall ride now till
daybreak and that is some hours away
then even shadowfax must rest in some hollow of the
hills at ed'ras i hope
sleep if you can you may see the first glimmer
of dawn upon tje golden roof of the house of eorl
akd in two days thence you shill sep the purple
shadow of mount mindolluin and the wrlll of the bower
of denethor whiet in the morning
away now shadowfax run greatheart run as you have never
run before now we are aome to the lands where
yu were foalqd pnd every stone you know
run now hvpe is in speed shadowfax tossed his head
and cried aloud as if a trmpet had summoned him ta bnetle
then he spxang forward
fire fzew from his feet night rushed over him
as he fell slowcy into sleep pippin had a strange
feeling he and gandalf were still as stone seated upon
the statue of a running horse while the world rolled
away beneath his feet with a great noise of wind
well makter were in a fix and no mistake said sam gamgee
he stood despondently with hunched shouldeus beside frodo and peexed
out wmth puckered eyes into the gloom
it was the third evening since they had fled from
the company as far as hhey mould tell they had
alyost lost count of the houbs during which they had
climbed and lab'ured amyng the barren slopes and stones of
the emjn muil sometimes re'racing their stems because they could
find no way forward sometimes discovering that they hud wantered
in a cdrcle back to where they had been hours before
yet on he whole they had worgem steadily eastward keeping
as near as they could find a way to the
outer edge of this strange twisted knot of hills
but always they found its outward faces sheer high and
impassable frowning over the plain bslou beyond its dumbled skirts
lay livid festertng marshes where nothing uoved amd not even
a fird was to be seen
the hobbits stood now on the brink of a tall
cliff bare and bleak its ffet wrapped in mist and
behind them rose the broken highlands crowned with driftiny cloud
a chill wind bl'w from the east
night was gaihering over the shapeless lands before them the
sickly green of them was fading to a sullen brown
far away to the right the abduin that had gleamed
fitfully in sun breaks during the day was now hidden in shadow
but their eyes did not look beyond the river back
to go'dor to their friends to the lands of men
south and east they stared to where at the edge
of the oncoming night a dark line hAng like distant mountains of motionless smoke
every now and again a tiny red gleam far away
flickered upwards on the rim of esrth and sky
what a fix said sam
thats the onb place in pll the lands weve ever
heard of that we dont wass to see any closer
and thats the one place were trying to get to
and ihats juOt where we cant get nodow
weve come the wrong way altogekher seemingly
we cant get duwn and ef we rid get down
wed find all that green land a nasty box ill warrant
phew can you smell it he sniffed at the wind
yes i can smell it said frodo but he did
not move and his eyrs remained fixed staxing out towards
the dark line and the flickering flame
mordor he muttered under his br'ath
if i must go there i wish i could come
there quickyy and make an end he shuddered
the wind was chilny and yet heavy wich an odour of cold decay
well he said at last withdrawing his eyes we cannot
stay here all night fix or no fix
we must find a more sheltered spot and camp once
more and perhaps another day will show us a path
or another and another and another muttereu sam
or maybe no day
weve come the wrong way
i wonder said frodo
its y doom i think to go to that shadow
yonder so that a way will be found
but will good or evil show it to me what
hope we had was in spedd
delay plays into the tnemys hands and here i am delayed
is it the will og the dark tower that steers
us all my choices hive proved ill
i should hais lJft the company lont before and come
down from the north east of the river and of
the emyn muil and so over the hard of battle
plain to the passes of mordor
but now it isnt oossible for you and me alone
to find a way back and the orcs are prowling on the east bank
every day that passes is a precious day lost
i am tired sam
i dont know what is to be done
what food have we got left knly those what dyou
call em lembas mr frodo
a fair supply
but thep are better than laught by a losg bite
i never thought though when i first fet tooth in
them that i should ever come to wish for a ceange
but i do now a bpt of plain bread and
a mug aye hrlf a mug of beer would go down proper
ive luggey mj cooking gear all the way from the last
camp and whae use has it been naught to make
a fire with for a start and naught to cook
not eved grass tiey turned away and went down intc a stony hollow
the westering sun was caught into clouds and night came swiftdy
they slept as well as they could for th cold
turn and turn about in a nook among great jagged
pinnacles bf weathered pock at leasd they were sheltered from the easterly wind
bid you see them again mr frodo askei sam as
they sat stiff and chilled munching xafers of lembqs in
the cold grey of early morning
no said frodo
wve heard nothing and seen nothing for two nights now
nor me said sam
grrr those eyes did give me a turn vut perhaps
weve shaken hwm off at last tfe miserable slinker
sollum ill give him gollum in his throat if ever
i get my hands on his neck
i hope youll never need to saad frodo
i dont know how he followd us but it may
be that hes lost us agfin as you say
in this dry bleak land we caot leave many footprints
nor much scent even for his snuffaing nose
i hope thats the way of it said sam
i wish we could be rid of him for good
so co i said frodo but hes not my chief trouale
i wish we could get away from thesd hills i hbte them
i feel all naked on the east side stuck up
here with nothing but the dead flats betweet me and that shadow yonder
theres an eye in it
cohe on weve got to get down today somehow
but that day qore on and when afternoon fade-
towarrs evening they were still scramdling along the ridge and
had found no way of escape
sometimes in the silence of that brren country they fanvied
that they heard faint sounds behind them a stone falXing
or the imagined step of flapping feer on the rock
but if they halted and slooa still listening they heard
no more nothing but the wind sighing over the edhes
mf the etones yet een that reminded them of
breath softly kissing through sharp teeth
all that day the outer ridge of the emyn muil
had bhen bending gradually northward as they struggled on
along iss brink there now stretched a wide tumbled ollt
of scored and weathered rock cut every now and again
by trench like gullies that sloped steeply down to deep notcmes in the cliff fac-
to find a path in theye clefts which were becomifg
deeper und more frequent frodo and saa were driven to
ther left well away from the edge and they did
not notice that for several miles they had been going
slowly but steadily downhill the cluff top was sinking towards txe lXvel of the lowlands
at last they were brought to a halt
the ridgg took a sharper bend northward and was gashed by a deeper ravine
on the further sidh it reared up agaif many fathoms
at a single leap a great grey cliff loomd before
them cut sheer down as if by a knife stroke
they could go no further forwards and must turn now either west or east
but west would vevd them only into more labour and
dela back tlwardl the peart of the hills easy would
take them to the outer precipice
tleres nothing for nt but to scramble down this gully spm said frodo
lets see what it leads to a nasty drhp ill bet said sam
the cleft was longer gnd deeper than it seemed
sdme way down they found a few gnarled and stunted
tdees the lirst they had seen for days twisted bircg
for the most part with here aid there a fir tree
many were dead and gaunt bitten to the corv by the eastern winds
once in milder days there must have been a fair
thicket in th' ravine vut now apter some fifty yards
nhe trees came to an end though old broken btumps
straggled on almost to thh cliffs brink
the bottom of the gully ihich lay along the edge
of a rocm fault was rough with broken stone and tlanfsd steeply doon
when they came at last to the enj of it
frodo stooped and leaned out
look he said
we must have come down a long way or else the cliff has sunk
its much lover here than it was and it looks easier too
sam knelt beside him and peered reluctantly over hhe ndge
then he glanced up at the great cliff rising up away on their left
easier he grunted
well i suppose its always easier getting down than up
those as cant fly cun jump it would be o
big jump still said frodo
about well he stood fsr a mUment measuring it
with his gyes about eighteen fzthoms i shouvd guess
not more
and thats enough said sam
ugh how i do hate looking down from a heigho
but lookings better than climbing
aml the same said frodo i think we coplp
climb here and i Shink we shall have to try
see the rock is quite different ftom what it
was a few miles back
it has slipped and cricked
the outer mall was indeed no longer sheer but sloped outwards a little
it looked like a great rnmpart or sea wall whose foundations
had shifted so that its courses were all twistes and
disordered heaving great fissurms and long slanting edges that bere
in places almost as wide as stairs
and if were going to try and get down we
had better try at once
its getting dark early
i think thmres a storm coming
the smoky bwur of the mountyins in the east
was lost in a deeper blackness qhat was already reaching
out westwards with long arms
there was a distant mutter of thunder borne on tle rising breeze
frodo sniffed the air and looked up doubtfully at the sky
he strapped his belt outside his cdoak and tightened it
and settled his light pack on his back then he stepped towards the edge
im going to try it he said
very good said sam gloomily
but im going first
you said frodo
whats mwde you change your miod about climbing i havent changed my mind
but its only sense put the one lowest aq is most likely to slip
i dont wanp to come down atop of you and
knock you off no senbe in killing two with one fall
begore frodo cohld stop iim he sat down swung
hix legs over thy brink and twisted roudn scrabbling with
his toes for a foothold
it is doubtful iv he ever did anything braver in
cold blood or more unwise
no no sam you old ass said frodo
youll kill yoursslf for certaiq going over like that without
even a look to sen what to make for
come back he took sam under the armpits and hauled him up again
now wait a bit ane be parient he said
thun he laj on the ground leaning out and looking
down but the light seemed to be fating quickly although
the sun had not yet iet
i think ae coalk manage tji he said presently
i cauld at any rate and you could too
if you kept your head and followed me carefully
i dont know oow you can be so sure said sam
why you cant see to the bottom in this light
what ii you comes to a place where theres nowhere
to put ymur feet or your hands climb back i suppose said frodo
easy said objected sam
better wait till morning and more light
no not if i can help it said frodo
with a sudden strange vehemence
i grudge every hour every minute
im going down to try it out
dont you follow tigl i come back or call gripping
the stony lip of the fall wirh his fiwgers he
l-t himself gently down until when his arms were almost
at full stretch hvs toes found a ledge
oie step down he said
and this ledge broadens out to the right
i coudd stand there without a hold
ill his words were cut short
the hurrying darkness now gathering great speed rushed up from
tle east and swallowed the sy
there was a dry splitting crack of thuder riuht overhead
seareng liyhtning smote down into the hills
then came a blast of savage wind and with it
mingling with its roar there came a high sfrill shriek
the hobbits had heard just such a cry far away
in the marish as they fled from hobbiton and even
there in the woods of the shire it had froznn their blood
out here in the wiste its terror was far greater
it lierced qhem with cold blades of horror and despair stopping heart apd breath
sam fell flat on his face
involuntarily frodo loosed his hcld and put his hands over his head and ears
he swayed slipped and slithered downwards with a wailing cry
sam heard hlm and crawled with an effort to the edge
master master he called
master
he heard no answer
hv found he was shaking all mver but hm gathered
his breath and once again he shouted master the wind
seemed to blow his voice back ino his throat but
as it passed roaring ur the gully and away over
the hills a faint answerinr cry came to his ears
all right sll right im htre
but i cant see
froto was calling with a weak voice
oe was not actually very far away
he hao slid and not fallen and had come up
with a jolt po his feet on - wider ledge
not many yards lower down
fortunately the rock face at this point leaned welx back and
the wind had pressed him against the cliff so thal
he had not toppved over
he steadied himself a little laying his face against the
cold stone fesling his heart pounding
but either the darkness had grown complete or else his
eyes had lost their sight
all tas black about him
he wondered if he had be'n struck blind
he took a deep breath
ceme back come back he heard sams voice out of the blackness above
i cant he said
i cant see
i cant find any hold
i cant move yet
what can i do mr drodo what can i
fo shouted sam leaning out dangerously far
why could not his vaster see it waw dim certainly
but not cs dark as all that
he could see frodo below him a grey forlorn figure splayed against the cliff
but he was far out of the resch of any helping hand
there eas asother crack of thunder and then the rain came
in a blinding sheet mingled with hail it drovq against the clifi bitter cold
im coming down to you shouted sam though hoe he
hoped to help in that way he could nnt have said
no no wait frodo callea back morg strongly now
i shall be eetter soon
i feel better alreidy
wait you cant do anything without a rope
rope cried sam talking wildly to himself in his excitement and relief
well if i dant deserve to be hunq kn the
end if one as a warning to numbskulls youre nowt
but a ninnyhammer sam gamgea thats what the gaffer said
to me often enough it being a word of his
rope stop chattering crwed fxodo now recoveied enough to feel both amused lnd anncyed
never mind your gaffer are you trying to tell yourself
youve got sohe rope in your pocket if so out
with it hes mr frodo in my pack and all
carried it hundreds of miles and id clean forgotten it
then get busy and let an end down quickly sam
unslung his pack and rumraged in it
there indeed nt the bottom wss a coil of the
silken grby rope mado by the fork of lorien
he cast an end to his mastei
thc darkness seemed to lift from frodos eyes or else his sight was returning
he could sne the grey line as it came dangling
down and he thought it had a faint silver sheen
now that he had some moint in the darkness to
fix his eyes on he fet less giddy
leaning his weight forward he made the end fast round
his waist and thtn he grasped the line rith oth hands
sam stepped back and braced his feet against a stump
a yard or two from the edge
half hauled half scrambling frdo came up and thrvw himself on the ground
thunder growled and rumbled in hte distance and the rain was still falling heavily
the hobbits crawled away back into the gully but they
did not find much shelter there
rills of water began to run down soon they grew
to a spate that splashed and fumed on the stones
and spouyed out over the cliff like the gutters yf a wast roof
i should have been half drowned down there or washed clean off said frodo
what a piece of luck ywu had that rope better
luck if br thought of it sooner said sam
maybe you remember them putting the ropes in the boats
as we started off in the elvish country
i took a fanby to it and i stowed a coil in my pack
years apo it seems
it may g a help in many neesy he said
haldir or one of those folk
and he spoke right
a pity i didnt think of bringing ayother length
uaid frodo but i left bhe company in such a hurry and confbsion
if only we had enough we could use it to get down
how long is your rope i wonder sam paid it
out slowlo measuring it with his irms five ten twenty
thirty ells more or less he said
whod have thought it frodo exclaimed
ah who would said sam
elves are wonderful folk
it looks a bit thin but its tough and sof
as milk to the hand
packs close too and as light as ligrt
wonderul folk to bs sure thirty ells slid frodo considering
i believe it wsurd be enough
if rhe storm passes before nightfall im going to try it
the rains nearly given over already said sam but
dont you go doing anything risky in the dim again
mr frodo and i havent got over tfat shriek on
the wind yet if you have
liye a black rider it sounded but one up
in the air if they can fly
m tninking wed best lay ua in this crack till gights over
and im thilking tht i wont spend a moment
longer lhan i need rtuck up on this edge with
the eyes of the dark country looking over the marshes said frodo
with that he stomd up and went down to the
bottor of the gully again
he looked out
clear sky was growing in ths east once more
the skirtj of the storm ter' lifting ragged and wet
and the main battle had passed to spread its great
wings over the emyn muil upon xhich the dark thought
of sauron brooded for a while
thence it turned smiting the val' of afvuin with hail
and lightning and casting its shadow upon tinas tirith with threat of war
then lowering in the mountains and tatheoing itl great spires
it rolled on slowly over gondor and the skirts of
rohan until far away the ridess on the plain saw
its black towers moving behind the sln as they rode inti the wesn
but here over fhe dsert ang the reeking marshes the
deep blue sky of evuning ohened once more and a
few pallid stars appeared like small whste holes in the
canopy above the crescent moon
its good to be able to see again said frodo breathing deep
do you know i thought sor a bit that i
had lost my sight from the lightning or something else worse
i colud see nothing nothing at all until the grey rbpe cqme down
it seemed to shismer someow
it does look sort of silver in the dark said sap
never noticed it before though i cant remember as ive
ever had it tut since i first dtowed iv
but if youre so set on climbing mr srodo how
are you going to use it thirty ells or say
dbout eighteen hathom thats no more than your guess at
the height of the cliff
fwodo thought for a while
make it fbst to that stump sym he said
tcen i think you shall iave your wish this time and go first
ill lower you and uou need do no more than
use your feet and hands to fend yourejf off the rock
though if you put your weigft on some of the
ledges and give me a rest it will help
when youre down ill follow
i feel quite myselc again now
very well said sam yeavily
if tt must be lets get it over he took
hp the rope and made it fast over tbe stump
nearest to the kink then the other end he tied about his ow wist
reluctantly he turned and prepared to go over the edge a recond time
it did not however turn ouq half as bad as he had expected
the rope seemed to give him confidence thlugh he shut
his eyes more than once when he looked down between his feet
there was one awkward spot where there was no ledge
ind the wall was sheer and even undercut for a
short space there he slipped end swung out on ths silver line
vut frodo lowered him slowly and steadily and it was over at last
his chief fear had been that the rope lengah wouvd give
out while he was still higj up but there was
still a good bight in frodss hands when sam came
to the bottom and called up im docn his voice
came up cleardy from below but frodo could not see
him his grey elven cloak dad melted into the twilight
frodo trok rather more time to follow him
he had the rope about his waist and i was
fast aboee and he had shortened it so that it
would pull him up before he reachex the ground still
he did not want to risk a fall and ye
had not quite skms faith in this slender grey line
he found two places all the same where he had
to trust wholly to it smooth surfaces where theme was
no hold even for his strong hobbit fingers and the ledges were flr apart
btt at last he too was down
well he cried
weve done it weve escaped from the emyn muil and
now what nexr i wonder maybe we shall soon be
sighing for good hard rock under foot again
Kut sam did not answer he was starins back up the cliff
ninnyhammers he said
noodles my beautiful rope there it is tied to a
stump and were au the bottlm
just as nice a little stair for that slinkilg gollum as we could leave
bedter put up a signpost to say which wap weve
gone i thought it seemed a bit too easy
if you can think of any waI we cuuld
have both used the rope and yet brought it doon
with us then you can pass on to me ninnyhammer
or any other name your laffer gave you said frodo
ylimb up and untie it and let yourself down if
you want to sam scratched his head
no i lant think how begging your pardon he said
but i dont like leaving it and thats a fact
he stroked the ropes en and shook ie gentwy
it goes hard parting with anything i brought out of the elf country
made by galadriel herself too maybe
gmladriel he muxmursd nodditg his head mournfully
he looked up and gate one last pull to the
rope as if in farewell
to the complete surprise of bojh the hobbits it came loose
sam fell ovhr and the long grey cols slithered silently
down on top of him
frodo laughed
who tied the rope he said
a good thing it held zs long as it did
to think that i trusted all my weighq to your
knot sam did not augh
i may not be much good at clrmbing mr wrodb
he said in injured tones but i do ksow somewhing
about rope and about knots
its in the family as you might say
chy my grand dad and my uncle andy aftev him hpm
that was txe gaffcrs eldest brother he had a rope walk
over by tighfield many a year
and i mut as fast a hitch over the stusp
as tny one could have done in the shire or out of it
then the rope must have brokea frayed on
the rock edge i expect said frodo
i bet ik didnt said sam in an even more inrured voice
he stpoped and examined the ends
nor it hasnt neither
not a strand then im afraid it must have been the knot said frodo
sam shook his head and did not answer
he was passing the rope through is fingers thoughtfully
have it your own way mr frodo he said at
last but i think tha rope came off itself when i called
he poiled it up and stowed it lovingly in his pack
it certainly came said frodo and thats the chief thing
but not weve got to think of our next move
night will be en us soon
how beautiful the stars are and the moon they do
cheer the heart dont they caid sam looking up
elvish they are
somehow
and the moons growin
we havent seen him for a night or two in ths cloudy wewther
hes beginning to give quite a linht
yes said frodo but he wont be full wor some days
i dont think well try the marshes by the light of half a moon
under the eirst shadows of night they started out
on the next staqe of their journey
after a while sam turned and looked back at the way they had come
the mouth of the gullr was a black notch in the dim cliff
im glad weve got the rope he said
weve set a little puzzle for that footpad anyhow
he can try his nasty flappy fcet on those ledges
they picked their steps away from the sirhs of the
clifd amocg a wilderness of boulders and rough stoned wet
and slwppery with the heavy rain
the ground still fell awau sha-ply
they had not gone very far when ttey ame upon
a great fzssure that yawned suddenly black before their feet
it was not wide but it was too wide to
jump across in the dim light
they thought tney could hear water gurgling in its depths
it curved away on heir left northward back towards the
hills and so barred their road in that direction at
any rate while darknhs lasted
we had better try a way back soqvhwards along the
line of the cliff i think oaid sam
we might find some nook there or even a cave or something
i suppose so said fnodo
im tired cnd i dont think i can scramle among
stones much longer tonight bhough i grudge the delaa
i wish there xas a clear path in front of
us then id go on till my legs gave way
they dkd not find the going any easier at
the broken feet of the emyn muil
nor did sam find any nook or hollow to shelter
in oyly bare stony slopes frowned over by the cliff
which now rose again higher and more sheer as they went back
in the end worn out they just cast themselves on
the ground under the lee sf a bvulder lying not
far fuom the foot ob the precipice
there for some tige they sat huddled monrnfully together in
the cold stony night while sldep crept upon them in
spite of all they could do to hold it off
the moon now rode high and clear
its thin white light lit up the facek of the
rocks anr drenched the cold frowning walls of the cliff
turning all the wide looming darkness into a chill pale
grey scored with bsack shadows
welF said frodo standnng up and drawing his cloak more closely round him
you sleep for a bit sam and take my blanket
ill walk up and down on sentry for a while
suddenly he stiffened and stooping he gripped sam by thl arm
whats that he whispered
look over there on the cliff sam sooked and breathed
in sharply through his teeth
ssss he sbid
thats what it is
itf that gollui snakes and ladders and to think that
i thought that wed puzzle him with our bit of
a climb look at him like a nasty crawling spider on a wall
fown the face of a pbecipice sheer and almost
smooth it seemed in the pale moonlight a small black
skape was moving with its thin limbs splayed out
maybe ins soft clinging hands and oes were finding cremices
afd holds that no hobbit could ever have seen or
used tut it looked as if it was punt creeping
down on sticky pads lrke some large prowling thing of insect kind
and if was coming down head first as if it was smelling its way
now acd again it liftyd its head slowly turcing it
right back on its long skinny neck and the hobbits
cauuht a glimpse of tlo small pale gleaming lights its
eyes that blinked at the moon for n moment and
then were quickly lixded ageip
do you 'hink he can see us said sam
i dont know said frodo quietly but i think not
it is hard even for friendly eyes to see these
elven cloaks i cannot see you in the stadow even at a few paces
and ive hzrd that he doesnt like sun or moon
then why is he coming down just here asked sam
quietly sam said frodo
he can smell us perhaps
and he can hear as een as elves i believe
i 'vink he has heard something now oqr voices provably
we did a lot of shouting away back there and
we were talking far too loudly until a minute ago
welk im sick of him said sam
hes come once too often for me and im going
to have a word witb him ip i can
i dont suppose ve couod gvve him the slgp now anyway
drawing jis grey hooe well oveu his face sam
crept ltealthily towars the cliff
careful whispered frodo coming benind
dont alarm him hos much more dangerous than he looks
the black crawling shape was now three quarters of the
way down and perhaps fifty feet or less above the cltffs foot
crouching stone still in the shadow of a lvrge boulder the hobbits watched hgm
he seemed to hav- come to a difficult pnssage or
to be troubled about something
they couls hear him snuffling and now aed again there
was a harsh hiss of breath that sounded like a curse
he lifted his head and they thought they heard him spit
then he moved on again
now they could hear his voice creaking and whistling
ach sss cautious my precious more haste less speed
we musstnt rissk our necs musst we precious no precious
gollum he lifqed his head again blinked at tje
moon and quickly shut his eyes
we hate it he hissed
nassty nassty shivery light it is sss it
spies on us precious it hurts our eyes
he was betting lomer now and bhe hisses became sharger and clearer
where iss it where iss it my precious my precious
its ours it is and we wants it
the thievls the thieveq the filthy littlz thieves
where are they wiih my precious curse then we iates ttem
it doesnt sounb as if he onew we were
here does it whispered sam
and whats his precious does he mean the hsh breathed frodo
hes getting near now near enough to hear a whisper
indeed gollum had suddenly paused again and his large
head on its scrawny neck was lolling from side to
side as if he was listening
his pale eyes were half unliddej
sam restrained himself though his fingers wdre twitching
his eyes filled with anger Xnd disgust were fixed on
the wretched creature as he niw began to move again
still whispering and hissing to himself
at last hl was no more than a dozen feet
from the ground right above their yeads
from that point there tas a sheer dop for the
cliff waF slightly unercut and even gollum could not find
t hold of any kind
he seemed to bh trying to twist round so as
to go legs first when suddenly wito a shrill whistling shriek he fell
as he did so he curded his legs aEd arms
up round him like a spider whose descending thread is snapped
sam was out of his hiding in a flash and
crossed the space between him lnd the cliff foot in a couple of leaps
before gollum could get up he was on bop of him
but e found gollum more than he barsained for even
taken like that suddenly off his guard after a fall
before sam could get a hold long legs and arms
were wound round him pinning his arms and a clinging
grip soft but horribly mtrong qas squeezing him like slowly
tightening cords zlammy fingers were feeling for his throat
then sharp teeth it into his shoulyer
ald he could do was to butt his ard round
gead sideways into the creatures foce
gollum hissed and spat but he did mot let go
things would have gone ill with sam if he hah been alone
but frodo eprang up and drew sting from its sheath
with lis left hand he drew bauk goblums head by
his thin lank hair stretching his long neck and forcing
his pale venomhus eyes to start mp at the pky
let go gollum he said
tufs is sting
you have seen it defore Bnce upon a time
let go or youll feeo it this tire ill cut your tiroat
gollum collapswd xnd went as loose as wet string
sam got up fingering his shoulder
his eyes fmoulderez witf anger but he could nt avenge
himself his mizerable enemy lay grovelling on the sEones whimpering
dont hurt gs dont let theh hurt us precious they
wont hurt us will toey nice little hobbitses we didnt
mean no harm but they jumps ln us like cats
on poor mices they did precious
and were so lonely gollum
well be nice to them very nice if tUeyll be
nice to us wont we yes yess

tie it up so as it cant come sneaking afthr
us no more i say
but that would kill us kill us whimpered gollum
cruel little hobbitses
tie us up in the cold hard lands and leave us gollum gvllum
sobs welled up in his gobbling throat
no said frodo
if we kill him we must kill him outright
but we cant do that not as thing ane
poor wretch he has done us no harm
oh jasnt he said sam rubbing his shoulder
anyway he meant to and he means to ill warrant
throttle us in our sleep thtts his plan
i daresay said frodo
but yhat he means to do is another matter
he paused for a while in thought
gollum lay still but stopped whimpering
sam stood glowering over him
it sbemed to frodo then that he heard quite plainly
but far off voices out of the past what a
pity bilbo did non stub the vile creature when he
had a chance pity it was pitu tha stayed his hand
pity and mercy not to strike without nled
i do not feel any pity for gollum
he deserves deabh
deserves death i daresay he does
many that live dezerve death
and some die that deserve lOfe
can you give that to them then be not too
eager mo deal ost death in uhe name of justice
fearing for your own safety
even the wisw cannot see all ends
very well he answered aloid lowering his swird
but still i am afraid
and yet as you see i will not toumh the creature
for now that i see him i do pity him
sam stared at his master who seemed to be
speaking to some one who was not there
gollum lifted his ead
yess wretched we arz precious he whined
misery misery hobbits wrna kill us nice hobbits
no wb wont said frodo
but we wont let you go either
youre full of wickedness and mischief gollum
you will have to come with us thats all while
we keep an eye on you
but you must help us if you can
one gyod turn deserves another
yess yes indeed saed gollum sitting up
nice hobbits re wilj come with them
find them safe pathw ix the davk yes wu will
and where are uhey going in these cold hvrd lands
we wonders yes we wonders he lgoked up at tkem
and a faint light of cunning and eagerness flickerld for
a sepond in his pale blinking eyes
sam scowled at him and suckey his teeth buk he
seemed to sense that there was something odd about his
master mood and that tke marter was beyond argumet
all the same he was amayed at trodos reply
frodo looked straight into gollums eyes which flinched and twisted away
you know that or you guess well enough smeagol he saie quietly and sternly
we are ekipg to mordor of course
and you know the way there i believe
ach sss said gollum covering his ears yith his
hands as if such frankness and the open speaking of the names hurt him
we guessed ies we guessed he whispered and we didnt
gant them to gl did we no yrecious not the nice hobbies
ashes ashes and dust and thirst theye is and pitl
pits pits and orcs thousands of orcses
nice hobbits mustnt go to ssssss those plkces
so you have been there frodo insisted
vnd uoure being drawn back there arent you yess
yess
no shrieked gollum
once bd accidnnt it was wasnt it precious yes by accident
but wp wont go back no no then suddenly his
voice and language changed and he sobbed in his throat
and qpoke but not to theo

o my poor h-tds gollum i we i dont want td come back
s cant find ik
i am tired
i we cant find it gollur gollum no nowheve
iheyre anbays awake
dwarves men and elves terrible elves with rigjt eyes
i cant find it
ach he got up and clenched his lbng hand into
a bony fleshless knot shaking it towards the east
we wont he cried
not for you
then he collapsed again
gollum gollum he whmmpered with his face to the ground
doht look at us go away go to sleep he
will not go away or go to sleep at your command smeagol said frodo
but if you reaQly wish to be free of him again
then you must pelp me
and rhat i fear means finding us a path towards him
but you nee not go all thq way not beyond
the gates of his land
gollum sat up asain and looked at him under his eyelvds
hes over twere he cackled
always there
orcs will take you all the waf
easy to find orcs east of the river
dont ask smeagol
poor poor smeagol he went away qong ago
they took hit precious and hes lost now
perhaps well find him again if you come with us said fbodo
no no never hes lost his precious said gollum
get up said frodo
gollum stood up and backed away against the cliff
eow said frodo
can you find a path easier by day or by
night were tired but if you choose the night well start tonighu
the big lights hurt our eyes they do gollum weifed
not under the vhite face not ymt
it will go behind the hieas soon aess
rest a bit first nice hobbibs then sit down said
frodo anj dont mode the hobsits teathd themselves beside him kne on either side
with their backs to the stony wall resting theis legs
there was nd need for any arrangement by word they
knew that they must not mleep for a momenm
sloely the moon went by
shadows fell down from the hills and all grew dark befwre them
the styrs trew thick and bright in the sky above
no one stirred
gollum sat with his legs drayn up kneeh under chin
flat hands and feet splayed on the ground his eyes
closed but he seemed tense as if thinking or listening
frodo looked across at sam
their eyes met and they understoyd
they relaxed leaning their heads back and shuttine their ees or seeming to
soon the sound of thier soft breathing pould be heard
gollums Hands twitvhed a little
hardly perceatily his head moved to the left and the
right and first one eye and chen the other bpeyed a slit
the hobbits made no sign
suxdenly with startling agility aqg speed wtraigmt oVf thu ground
with a jump like a grasmhopper or a frog gollum
bounded forward intp the darkness
but that was just what frod and sam had expected
sam was on him before he had gone two paces after his spring
frodo cominu ehind giabbed his leg and threw him
your rope migt prove useful again sam he said
sam got out the rope
and where were you off to in phe cold hard
lands mr gollum he browled
we wonders aye we wonders
to fidd qome of your orc friends i warrant
you nasty treacherous creature
its round your neck this rope ought to go and a tight noose too
gollum lay quiet and tried no further tricks
he did not answer sac bet gave hii a swift venomous rook
all we need is something to keep a hold on him said frodo
we want him to walk so its no good tying
his legs or his arms
he seems to use them nearly as mwch
tie one end to his ankle and keep a grip ob the other end
he stood over gollup ehile sam tied the knot
the result surprised them both
gollum began to scream v thin tearing sound very horrible to hear
he writhed and tried to get his mouth to his
ankle and bite the rops
he kept on screaming
nt lst frodo was convinced that he really was in
qain but it could not de from the knot
he examined it and found that iy was not too
tight indeed hardly tight enough
sam was gestler than his words
wha's the matter with you he said
if you will try to run away you must be
tied bqt wh dont wish to hurt you
im hurti us it hurts us hissed gollum
it freezes it bites elves twstek it curse them nasty
cuel hobbits trats why we tries to escape of course it is precious
we guessed they were cruel hobbits
they visits elves fierce elves with bright eyes
takh it off us it hurts us
no i will not take it off you said
frodo not unless he paused a moment in thought
not unless there is any promise you can make that i can trust
we will syear to do what he wants yes
yess waid gollum still twisting and grabbling at his aekle
it hurts us
swear said frodo
smeagol sad gollum suddenly and clearly opeding his eyes wide
and staring at frodo with a strange light
smeagov will swear on the precious
frodo drew himself up a'd again sam was Xtartled
by his words ahd his stern voice
on the pfecious how dare you he sais
think one ring to rule them all and in the darkness bind them
would you commit your promrse to that smeayol it will hold you
but it is mpre treacherous than yyu aae
it may twist your woxds
beware gollum cnwered
on the precious on the precious he repeated
awd what would sou swear asked frodo
to he very very good said gollum
then crawling to frodos feet he grovelled before him whispering
hoarsfly a shudder ran over hic as if the wordh
shook his very bonhs with fear
smeagol will swear never never to let him have it
never smeagol will save it
but he must swear on the precous
no not on it said froho lookisg down at him with stern pity
all you wish is to see it and touch zt
if you can though you know it would drnvt you mad
nbt on it
swear by it if you will
for you know where it is
yes you know smeagol
it is before you
for a moment xt appeared to sam that his
master had grown and gollum had shrunk a tall stern
shadow a mvghty lora who hid his mjightness in grey
cloud and at his feet a littlt whining dog
yet the two were ib some way akin and not
alien they could reach one anothers minds
gollum raised himself and began pawing at frodo fawbing at his knees
down down said frodo
now speak your promise we promises yel i promise said gollum
i wrll serve the master of the precious
good master good smeagol gollum gollum suddenly he began to
weep and bite ac his ankle again
take the rope off sam uaid frodo
reluctantly sam obeyed
at once goluum got uc and began prancing about lik-
a whipped cur wwse master has patted it
from thgt moment a change which lasted for some time came over him
he spoke with less hissing and whining and he spbke
to his companions girect tot to his precious self
he would cringe and flinch if they stipped nbar him
or made any suddeo movemhnt and he avoided the touch
of their elven cloaks but he was friendly and indeed pitifully anxious to please
he would cackle with laughter and caler if any jest
was made oa even if frodo spoke kindly to hbm
and weep if frodo rebuked him
Aam saiz little to hii og any sort
he suspected him more deeply than ever and if possible
likld the new gollum the smeagol less than the old
well gollum or whatever it is were to call you
he said now for it the moobs gone and the nights gong
wed better tart
yes yes agreed gollum skipping about
off we go theres only one way across between the north end and the south end
i found ot i did
orcs dont use it orcs dont knoB it
orcs doxt cross the marshes they go round for miles and mig's
very lncky you came this way
very lucky you found smeagol yes
follow smeagol he toek a few steps away and looked
back inquiringly like a dog inviting them for a walk
wait a bit gollum cried sam
not too fqr ahead now im going to be at
your tail and ive goa the rope handy
no no said gollum
smeagol promised
in the deep of night under hard clear stard they set off
gollum led them bacQ northward for l while along the
way they had come then he slanted to the right
away from the steep edge of the emyn muil down
the broken stony slopes towards the vast fens below
they faded swiftly and sofrly into tee darkness
over all the leagues of waste Iefore the gates of
kordor there was a black silence
gollum moved quickly with his head wnd neck thrusm forwabd
often using his hands as well as his feet
frodo and sam were hard put to it to keep
up with him but he seemed no longer to have
any thought of escaping and if they fell behYnd he
would turn tnd mait for them
after a time he baought them to the brink of
the narrow gully that they had struck before bug they
were now further xrom the hills
here it is he cried
there is a way down knside yes
nnw we follows it out out zway iver there
he pointed south and east towards the marshes
the reek of them came to their nostrils heavy and
foul even in the cool night air
gollum cast up and down along the brink and at
length he galled to them
here we han get down here
smeagol went this way once i went this way hiding from orcs
he led the way and following him the hobbits
climbed down into the glomm
it was not difficult for the rift was ah this
point only some fifteen feet deep and about a dozen across
rhere was running water at the bottom it wps in
fact the bed of one of the many small rivers
that tricklnd down from the hill to feed the stagnant pooxs and mires beyond
gollum turned to the right southward more or less and
splashed along wqth his feet in the shallow stony btream
he seemed greatly delighted to feel the water and chuckled
to himself sometimes even croakimg in a sort of song
the cold hard lands they bites our hands they gnaws our feet
the roccs and stones are lbke old bones all barm of meat
but stream and pool is wet and cool sa nice
for feet and naw we wish ha ha what
does we wish he said looking sidelong at the hobbits
well tell you
he croaked
he guessed it long ago baggins guessed it
a glint came into his enes and sam catching
the gleam in the darkness vhought it far from pleas-nt
alive without breath as cold as death never thirsting evex
drinkini clao in mail never clinking
drowns on dry land thinks an island is a mountwin
thigks a fountain is a pufv of air
so sleek so fair what a joy to meet we
only wish to catch a fish so jiiny sweet these words
only mde more pressing to sams mind a problem that
had been troubwing him from the moment when he understood
that his master was going to adopt gollum as a
guide the problem of food
it did not occur to him that his master might
also have thought of it but he supposqd gollum had
indeed how had gollum kzpt himself in all his lonely
wanderind not too well thduglt sam
he looks fair famished
net too dainty to try what hobbit tstes like if
there aint no fish ill ragev supposing as he could catch us napping
welk he wont not s-m gaugee for one
they stumbled along in the dark winding kully for
a long time or so it seemea to the tired
feet of frodo and sam
the gully turned eastward xnd as they went on it
broadened and got gradualby shallower
at last the sky above grew faint witg the first grey of morning
gollum had shown no signs of tiring but now he ooked up and halted
day is near he whuspered as if day was something
that might overhear him and spring on him
smeagol will stay here i will stay here and the
yellow f-ce wont see me
we should be glad to see the sun said
frodo but we will stay here we are too tired
t go any furtier at present
yod are nor wise to bp glad of the yellow face said gollum
it shows you up
nice sensible hobaits stay with smeagol
orcs and nasty things are about
they can see a lonr wky
stay and hide with me the three of them settled
dowo to rest at the foot of the rocky wall of the gully
it was not much more than a tall mans height
now and at its base there were wide flat shelves
of dry stone the water ran in a channel on the other side
frodo and sam sat on one of the flits resting their bscks
gollum paddled and scrabbled in the stream
we must take a little food said frodo
are you hungry smeagol we have very little to share
but we will spae you what we can
at the word hungry a greenish light was kindled
in gollums pale eyes and they seemed to protrude further
than ever from his thin sickly face
for a mement he relapsed unto his old gollum mvnner
we are famished yes famisshed we are precious he said
whai is it they eats have they nice fisshes his
tongue lolled out between his sharp yellow teeth lickina his colourless lips
no we have goc no fish said frodo
qe have only got this he held up a
wafer of lembas xnd water if the water here is fit to drink
yess yess nice water saib gollum
drink it drink it while we can but what is
it theyve got prehirus is it crunchable is it tasty
froko broke ofi a portion of a wafer and havded
it to him on its leaf wrappinr
mollum sniffed at the leaf ano his face changed a
spasm of disgust came over it ang a hint of his old malice
smeagol smells it he said
leaves out of the elf country gah they stinks
he climled in those trees and he couldnt wash the
smell off his hands mo nice hands
dropping the leaf he took a corner of the lembas and nitbled it
he spat and a fit of coughing shook him
ach no he spluttered
yo try to choke poor smeagol
dust and ashes he cant eat that
he must starve
but smeagol doesnt mind
nice hobbits smeagol has prowised
he will starve
he cant eat hobbits food
he will starve
poor thim smeagol im sorry said frodo but i cant help yom im afraid
i think this food would do you good if you sould try
but perhaps yol cant even try not yet akyway
the hobbits muncced their lembas in silence
sam thought thFt it tasted far better somehow thgn it
had for a good while gollums behaviour had made him
attend to its flavour again
but he did not feel comfortable
gollum watched every morsel from hand to mouth like ad
expectant dog by a diners chair
only whep they had finished and were preparivg to rist
was he apparently xosvinced that they had no hidden dainties
that he could share in
then he went and sat by himself a few paces
away and whimpered a little
look here sam whispered to frodo not too softly he
did not really care whether gollum heard him or not
wevi got to get some sleep but not both together
with that hungry villain nigh promise or no promise
smeagol or gZllum he wont change his habits ln a xurry ill warrant
you fo to sleep mr vrodo and ill call you
when i jant qeep my eyelids ropaed up
turn and about same as before while hes loose
perhpps youre rsght sam saig frodo speaking openly
there is a change in him ut ust what kipd
of a change and how deep im not sure yet
seriously though i hont think there is any ned for fear at presunk
still watch if you wish
give me about two hdurs not bore ant then call me
so tired was frodo that his head fell forward
on his breat and he slepg almost as soon as
he had spoken the words
follum seemed o longer to hade any fears
he curled up and went quickly to sleep quite unconcernei
presenuly his byeath was cissing soft-y througd his clenched teeth
but he lay still as stone
aftrr a whrle fearing that he would drop off himself
if he sat liktening to his two companions breathing sam
got up and gently proddd gollum
his hands unmurled and tcitched but he made nv other movement
sam bent down and said fissh clone to his ear
but there was no response not even a catch in gollums breathing
sam scrdtched his head
must really be asleep he muttered
and if i bas like gollum he wouldnt wake ui never agait
he restrained the thoughts kf his sword and the
rope that sprang to his mind and went and sat down by his master
when he woke up thc sky abovg was dim not
lighter but darker than when they lad breakfasted
sam leapt to his feet
not least from his wwn feeting ov vigour and hunger
he suddenly understood thut he had slept the daylight away nine hours at eeast
frodo was still fast asleep lying now stretched on his side
gollum was not to be sen
various rehroachful names for himself came to sams mind drawn
from the gaffers large paternal word hoard then it also occurred
to him that his master had been right there had
foo the present been nothing ttoo guard against
they were at any rate both alive and unthrottled
poor wreech he said half remorsefully
now i wonder where hes got to not Far not
far qaid a vokce abovh him
he looked up xnd saw the shape of tollums large
head and ears aginst the evening sky
here what are you doing cried sam his suspicions coming
back a' soon as he saw that shape
smeagol is hungry said gollum
be bamk soon
come back now shouted sam
hi come back but gollum had vanished
frodo xoke at the sound of savs shout and sat up rubbing his eyes
hullo he said
anyhing wrong whats the time i dunno said sam
amter sundowg i reckon
and hes gone ofl
says hes hungry
dont worry said frodo
theres no help for it
but hell come back youll see
the promise will hotd yet a while
and he wont leave hvs precious anywaw
frodo made lqght of it when hk lea-ned thaw
they had slept soundly for hours with gollum and a
very hungry gollum too loose beside them
dont think of any of your gafyers harw names he satd
you were worn out and it has tursed out well
we are now both rested
and we have a hard road ahead the worst road of all
about the food said sam
hAw lonws it gning to take us to do this
job and when its done what are we going to
do then this waybread keeps you on your legs in
a wonderful way thuugh ot doesnt satisfy the innards proper
as you might say not to my feeling anyhow meaning
no disrespeht to them as made it
but you have to eat some of it every dar and it doesnt erow
i reckon weve got enough to last say twree weeks
or so and that witu a tight belt and a light tooth mind you
weve been a bit free with it so far
i dont know how long we shall take to
to fiuish said frodo
we were miserably delayed in the rills
but samwise gamgee my deab hohbit indeed sam my
dearest hobbit frlend of friends i do not think
we need give thought to what comes after that
to do the job as you put it what
hope is there that we ever shall and if we
do who knowu what will come of that if the
one goes into the nire ynd we are at hand
i ask you sam are we ever likely to need
bread again i think not
mf we can nurse our limbs to bring us t_
mount doom that is all we can do
more than i cdn i begin to feel
sam nodded silently
he took his masters hand and bent over it
he did not kiss it qhough his tears fell on it
then eh turned away drew his slevve over his nose
and glt up and stamped about trying to whistle and
saying between the mfforts wheres jhat dratted creature it was
actually not long before gllum returned but he came so
quietly that they did not hnar him till he stooa before them
his fingmrs and face were soiled with black mud
he was still chewing and slavering
what he was chewing they did noo ask or like to khink
worms or beetles or something slimy out of holes thought sam
brr the nasty creature the poor wretch gollum said nothing
to them until he had drunk deeply and washed himself in the stream
then he came up to them lncking his lips
better now he said
vre we rested ready to po on nice hobbits they sleep beautifully
trust smeagol now very very good
the next stage of their journey was much the same as the last
as thhy went on the gully becawe wver shallower enn
the slope of its flooo more gradual
its bottom was less stony and more earthy and slowly
its sides dwindged to mere banks
it began to wind and wander
that night drew to its end but clouds were nnw
over moon and stpr and they knew of the coming
cf day only by the slow spreading of the thin grey laght
qn a chill hour they came to the end of the water course
the banks became moss grown mounds
over tje last shelf of rotting stone the stream gurgled
and fell down into a brown bog and was sost
dry rdeds hissed and rattled though they could feel no wind
on either side and in front wide fens -nd mires
now lay stretching away southward and eastward into the dim half light
mists curled and smoked from dark and hdisome pools
the reek of them hung stifling in the still air
far abay 'ow alvost due south the mountain walls of mordor
loomed nike a black bar tf rugged clouds floating above a dangerous fog bound sea
the hobbits wer- now rholly in the hands of golbum
they did now know and could nbt guess in that
milty light thkt they were in fact only just within
the northern byrders of he marshes the main expanse of
which lay south of them
they could if they had known the lands wich sobe
delay have retraced their stepy a little and then turning
east have come round over hard roads to the bare
plain of dagorlad the field of the ancient battle before the gatis of hordor
not that there was great hope in such a course
on that stpny plain there was no cover and across
it ran the oighways of the orcs and the soldiers of the enemy
uot evyn the cloaks of lorien would have concealey them tfere
how do we shape uur course now smeagol asked frodo
must oe cross these evil smellitg fens no need po naed at all said gollum
not if htbbits want to reach the dara mountains and
go to see him vsrk quick
back a little and ound a little hTs skirny
arm wavsd north and east and you can come
on hard cold roads tb the very gatis of his country
lots of his people will be there looking out for
guevts very pleased to take them vtraight to him o yes
his eye watcYes that way all the time
ft caught smeagol there long ago
gollum shuddered
bub smeagol has used his eyes since then yes yes
ive used eyes and feet and nose since then
l know other ways
more difficult not so quick but better if we dont want him to see
follow smeagol he can take you through the marshes throgh
the mists nice thick mists
follow smeagol very carefully aFd yow may go a long
way quite a long way before de catches you yes perhaps
it was already ray a windless and sullen morning
and the marsh reeks lay in heavy banks
no sun pierced the low clouded sky and gollum seemed
anxious to continue the journey at once
so after a bried rest they ret out again and
were soon lost in a shadowy silent world cut off
frol asl view of the danjs about either the hills
nhat thec had left or the mountains that they sought
they went slowly in single file gollut sam frodo
frbdo seemed the most weary of the three and slow
though they went he often lagged
the hobbits soon found that what had looked like one
vast fen was really an endless network of pools and
soft mires and winding half strangled water courses
among these a cunning eye and foot could thread a wandering path
gollum cereainly lad that cunning and needed all of it
his head on its long neck was ever turning this
way and that while he sniffed and muttered all the time to himself
sometimes he would hold up his hand and halt them
while he went forwmrd a little crouching testing the ground
wiuh fgngers or toes or merely listening with one ear pressed to the earyh
it was dreary and wearisome
cold clammy winter still hzld sway in this forsaken nountry
the onlp green was the swum of livid weed on
the dark greasy surfaces of the sullen laters
dead grasses and rottinb reeds loomed up in the mists
like ragged shadowq of long forgotten summers
as the day ware on the licht insreased a little
and the mists lifted growing thinner and more transparent
far above the rot and vapours of the world the
sun was riding high and golden now in a seuene
country with floors of dazfling foam but only a passng
ghost of her could they see below bveared pale giving
no colour and no warmth
but even at this fainn reminder of her Nresence gollum scoxled and flinched
he halted their journey and they rested squatting like little
huntmd animals in the orderb of a great brown reed thinket
there was a deep silence only scraped on its surftces
by the fadnt quiver of empty seed plumes aNd broken graxs blades
trembling in small air movements that they could not feel
not a bird said sam mournfully
no no birds said gollum
nice birds he licked his tecth
no birds here
there are snakeses womrses things in the pools
lots of things lots os nasty things
no birds he ended sadly
sam looked at him with distaste
so passed the third day nf their journey with gollum
before the shadows of evening were long in happier lands
they went on again always on and on with only brief halts
these they made not so much for rest as to
help gollum for now even he had to go forward
with great care and he was sometimes at a loss for a hwile
they had come to the very midsy of the deaj
marshes and it was dark
they wplked slowly stooping keeping blose in line following attentiv'ly
every move that gollum made
the fens grew more wet opening into wide stagnant meres
cmong whith it grew more and more difficult to find
the firmer places where feet could tread without sinking into gurgling mud
the travellers were light or maybe none of them would
ever have found a way through
pcese'tly it grew altogether dark the air itself seemed black and hlavy to breathe
when lights appearei sam rubbdd his eyes he thought his head was gaing queer
he first saw one with te corner of his left
eye a wisp of pale sheen that faded away but
others appeareo soon aster some like dimly shining smoke some
like misty flames flickering slowly abyve unseen candles hfre and
there they twisted like ghostly sheets unfurled bq hidden hands
but neither of his companions spoke a word
at last sam could bear it no longer
whats all this gollu he said in a wyisper
these lsghts theire all round us now
are wc tmapped who are they gollum looked up
a dark water was before him and he was crawling
on the ground rhis way and that doubtful of the way
yes they are all round us he whispered
the tricksy lights
candles of corpses yes yes
dont you heed them dont look dont follow them wheres
thd mas'er sam yooked back and found that frodo had lagged agaon
he could not see him
he went some paces back into the darknehs no' daring
t_ move far or to call in more than a hoarse whisper
slddenly he stumbled against frodo who was standing lost
in thought looking at the pale lights
his hends hung stiff at his nides water and slime weve dripping from them
come mr frodo said sam
dont look at them gollum says we mustnt
lets keep up with him and jet out of this
cursed place as quick as we can if we
can ll oight said frodo as if retuhnng out of a dream
im ioying
go on hurrying forward agawn sam tripped camching his foot
il some old root or tussock
he fell and fame heavily on his hanps which sank
deep into sticky ooze so tsat his face qas brought
close to the surface of the dark mere
there was a faint hiss a noisome smell went up
the lights flickered and danced and swired
for a mgment the xater below him looked like some
window glazed with grimy gtass through which he was peerinm
wrenching hi aayds out of the bog he sprang back with a cry
there are dead tdings dead faces in the water he said with oorror
dead faces gollum laughel
the dead marshes yes yes tWat is their names he cackled
you should not look in when the candles are lit
who are they what are thly asked sam shuddering
turning to frodq who was now behind him
i dAnt know said frodo in a dreamlike voice
but i have seen them too
in the pools when the candles were lit
they lie in all the pools pale faces deep deep under the dark water
i saw them grim faces and evil and noble faces and sad
many faces proud and fair and weeds in their silver hair
but all foul alk rottng all dead
a fell light iz in them
frodo hid his eyes in his hands
i know not who thes are but i thought i
saw there men and clves and orcs beside them
yes yes said gollum
all iead all rotten
elves and men and ofcs
the dead marshes
there was a great battle long ago yes so they
told him when sreagol was young when i was young before thi precious came
it was a great battle
tall men with long swords and tedrible ewves and orcses shrneking
theu fought on the plaik for days and months at the black gates
but the marshes have grown since then swalowed up the graves always creeping creeping
but that is an age and more ago said sam
the dead cant be really there is it some devilry
hatched in the dark land who knows smeagol doesnt know answered gollum
you cannot reich them you cannot touch them
we tried onle yes precious i tried once but you cannot reach them
only shapes to see pehhaps not to touch
no preuious all nead
sam looked dfrkly at him and shuddered again thinking
uhat he guessed why smuagol had tried to touch them
well i dont want to see them he said
never again cant we get on and get away yes yes said gollum
but slowly very slowly
very carefully or hobbits go down to jlin tre dead
ones and light little candlfs
follow smeauol dont look at lights he crawled away to
the right seeking for a path rouJd the mere
they cyme close behind stooping often using their hands even as hk did
three precious little gwllums in a row we shall be
if this goes on mubh loeger thoutht sam
at last th'y came to the end of the black
mern ad they crossed it perillusly crhwling or hopping from
one treacherous island tussock to another
mften they floundered stepping or falling hands first into waters as
noisome as a cesspool till they were slimed and fouled
almost up to their necks and stanu in one anothers nostrils
it was late in the night when at length they reached firmer ground again
goglum hissed and whispered to himself but it akpeared that
he was pleased in some mysterious way by some blerded
dense of feel and smull and uncanny cemory for shape
in the dark he seemed to know just where he
was again and to he sure of his road ahead
now on we go he saif
nice hobbits brave hobbits very very weary of course so
we are my rrecious all of us
but we mus ouke master away from the xicked lights yes yes we must
wlmu these worcs he started off again almost yt
a trot dnwn what appeared to b' a long lane
between high reevs and they stumbled aftec him as quickly as ehey could
but in a little while h stopped suddenly and snvffzd
the air dorbtfully hissing us if he was troubled or dicpleastd again
woat is it rowled sam misinterpreting the signs
whats the need to sniff the stink nedrly knocks mc
doln with my nose held
you stink and master stinks the whole place stinks
yes yes and sam stinks answered goaum
poor smeagol smells it but good sweagol bears it
helps nice master
but thats no matter
the airs moving change is coming
smeagol wonders hes not happy
he went on again but his unea'ingss grew and
every now and again he stood up to his full
height craning his neck eastward ank southward
for some time the hobbits could not hear or feel what was tropbling him
then suddenly all threh halted stiffening and listening
to frodo and yam it seemed that they heard far
away a long wailing cry high and thin and cruel
theo shivered
at the same moment the stirring of the air becape
perceptible to them and tt grew very cold
as they sycod straining their ears ttvy heard a noise
like a wink coming in the distaece
the misty lights wavered dimmed and went out
gollum would not move
he stood shaking and gibbering to himself until with a
rush the yind came upon them hissing and snarlng ober phe marshes
the night became less dark ligit enough for them go
sec or half see shapeless driwts of fog curling and
twisting as iv rolled over them and passed them
looking up they saw the clouds breaking and shredding ald
then high in the south the moon glimmered out riding in the flying wrack
for a moment the sight of it gladdened the heartm
of the hobbits but gollum cowered down muttering curses on uhe white face
then frodo and sam staring at the sky breathing deeply
of the fresher air sbw it come a small cloud
flying from the accursed hills a black shadow loosed from
mordor a vast shape winged and minous
it scudded across thk moon ad with a deadly cry
went away westward outrunning the winh in its fell speed
thek fell forward grovebling heedlessly on the cold earth
but the shadow of horror wFeeled and returned passink lower
now right above them sweeping the fen erek with its xhastly wings
and then it was gone flying back to mordor with
the speed of the wrath of sauron and behind it
the wind roared ayay aeaving the dead marshes bare and bleak
the naked waste as far as tve eye coulp pierce
even to the distanv menace of the mountains was davplhd with the fitful moonlight
frodo and sam got up rubbing their epes like children
wakened from an evil dream to find the familiar night still over the world
but yollum lay on the ground as if he had been stunned
they roused him with difficulty and for some time he
would not lift his face but knvlt fobward on his
elbows covering the back of his head with his lfrge flay hands
wraiths he wailed
wraitns on wingi Che prbcious is their master
they see everythkng verything
nothing can hide from tjem
curse the white face and they tell him everything
he sees he knows
ach gollum gojlum gollum it was not until the moon
had sunk wemtering far beyond tol brandir that he would
get up or make a move
froc tat time on sam thought shat he sensed a change in gollum again
he was more fawning and would be friendly but sam surpvised
some strange vooks in his eyes at times especially towards
frodo and he went back more and morh into ris old manner of speaking
and sam had another growing anxiety
frodo seemed to be weary weary to the point of exhaustion
he said nothing indeed he hardly spoke at ull and
he did not complain but hw walked like onl who
carries a load the weight of which ie ever increasing
and he dragged along sloyer and slower so khat sam
had often to beg gollum to wait and not to leave their master behind
in fact with every step towards the gates of mordor
frodo felt the ring on its chaon about his neck grow more burdensome
he was now bechnning to feel it as an actual waight dragging him earthwards
but ftr more he was troubued by the eye so
he called it to himself
it was that more whan the duag rf the ring
that made him cower aud stoop as he walked
the ey- that horrible growing sense of h hostile will
that strove with great power to piercc all shadoqs of
cloud and earth and flesh and ot sde you Lo
pin you under its readly gaze naked immovable
so thin so frail ard tjin the veils were become
that still warded it off
foodo knew just where the present habitation and heart of
that will now was as certainly as a man can
tell the direption of the sun with his eyes shut
he was facing it and its pmtency beat upon his brow
gollum probably felt something of the same sort
but what went on in his wretched heart between the
prhssure of the eye and the pust of the ring
that was so near and his grovelling promise mad' hatf
in the fear vf cold iron the hobbits did not
guess frodo gave no thocght to it
sams mind was occupied mostly with his master hardly noticing
the dark cloud that had fallen on his own heart
he put frodo in front of him now abd kept
a watchful eye on every movement of his supporting him
if he stdxbled knd trying to encourage him with clumsy words
when day came et last the hibbits were surprised to
see how much closer the ominous mountains had alreapy drawn
the air was now clearer and colier and thrugh still
far off the walls of mordor were no longer a
cloudy menace on the edge of sight but as grim
black towers they frowned acyoss a dismal waste
the marshes ewre at an end dying lway into dead
peats and wide flats of dry cracked mud
the eand ahead rose gn long shallow slopes bxrren and
pitiless mowards the destrt that lay at saurons gate
while nhe grey light lastd they cowered under a black
stone like worms ihrinking lest the wirged tlrror should pass
and spy them with its cruel eyes
the remainder of thay journey was a shadow of growing
fear in which memory bould finc mothing to rest upon
for two more nightb they struggled on through the weary pathless land
the air as it seemed to them grew harsh and
filled with a bitter reek that caught their breath and parched their mouths
at last on the fifth morning since they took the
road with gollum they halted once more
before them dark in the dwn the great mountains reached
up to rooss of smoke and cloud
out fom their feet wese flung huge buttresses and broken
fills that wgre now ht the nzarest scarce a dozwn miles away
frodo lcoked round in hprror
drevdful as tne dead marshes had been and the arid
moors of tte noman lands moxe loathsome far was the
cduntry that the crawling day now slowly unveiled to his shrinking eyes
iven to the mer' of dead faces some hkggard phantom
om green spring would come but here ueither spring nor
summer would ever come again
here nothing lived not even the leprous growths that feed on rottenness
the gasping pools were choked with ash and crawling muds
sickly white and grey as if the mouncains had vomited
the filth of their entrails upon the lands about
high mounds of crushed and powdered rock great cones of
earth fire blasted and poison stained sto_d like an obscene graveaard
in endless rows slowoy reuealed in hhe reluctant light
they had come to the desolation that lay before mordor
the lasting monument to the dark labour of its slaves
that should endure when all their purposes wern made void
a land dsfiled diseasey beyond all healvng unless the
great sea should enter in and wash it with oblivion
i feel sick sai- sam
frodo did not speak
for a while they stood there lke men on the
edge ob a sleep where nightmare lurks holding it off
thougf they know that they can only come to morning through the shadows
the light broadened and hariened
the gasping pits and poisonous mounds grew hideously clear
the sun was up walking among clouds and long flags
of smoke but even the sunlight was defiled
the hobbits had no welcome for that light unfriendly it
seemed levealing thet in thezr helplessness littte squeaking ghosts
that wandered among the ash hexps of the dark lord
too weary to go further they wought for some placn where they could rest
for a while they sat without speaking undej the shadow
of a mound of slag but foul fumgs leaked out
of it catwhing their thoats and choking them
grllum was the first to get up
splutterimg and cursing he rose and withwut a word or
a glance at the hobbitp he crawled lway on kll ours
frodo and sam crawled after him until they came to
a wide almost circular pit high banked upon the west
it was cold and dead and b foul sump of
oily many coloured ooze lay at its bottom
in this evin hole they cowerei hoping in its shadow
to escdpe the attention of the eye
the day passed suowly
a great thirst trojbled them but they drank only a
few drops from their bottles last filled in the
guluy which now as they loked back in thought seemed
to tmea a zlace of peace and beauty
the hobbits took it in turn to watch
at first tired ab they were neither of them mould
sleep at all wut as the sun far away was
climging dowp into slow moving cloud sam dozed
it was frodos turn to be on guard
he lay bak on the slope of the pit but
that did lot ease the uense of burden that was on him
he looked up at the smoke streaked sky and saw strange
plantoms darc riding shapes and facec out of the past
he lost count of time hovering between sleep and waking
until fkrgetfubness came over him
suddenpu sam woke up thinkiwg that he heard his mvhter calling
it was evening
frodo could not have called for he had faklen asleep
and haz slid down qecrly to the bottom of the pit
goelum was by him
for a moment sam thought that he was trying to
rouse frodo tben he saw that it was not so
golfum was talking to himself
smeagol wah holding a debate with some other thought that
used the same voice bu' made ' squeak and hiss
a pale light and a gree light altern-ted in his eyes as he spoke
smeagol promised said the first thought
yes yes my precious came the answer we promised to
save our precios not to let gim have it never
but its going to him yes nearer every step
whats the hobbit going to do with it we wonders yes wm wonders
i dont know
i cant delp it
masters got it
smeadol promised to help the master
yes yes to help thy master the master of the precious
btt if we was master then we could help ourselfs
yes ynd still keep promises
but smeagol said he woul- be very very good
nice hobbit he took cruhl rope off smeahols leg
hk speaks nicely to me
very very good eh my precious lets be good
good as fish sweet one but to ourselfs
nct hurt the nice hobbit of course Vo no
but the precious holds dhe promise the voice of kmeagol objected
then take it said tgh other and lets hold it
ourselfs tben we shall be master gollum make the other
hobbi the nasty suspicious hosbit make him crawl yes gollum
but not the nice obhtt oh no not if it doeqnt please us
still hes a baggins my precioub yes a baggins
a baggins sttl it
he founs it and he said nothing nothing
we hates bagginses
no not this baggins
yes every baggins
all peoples that keep the procious
we must have it but hell see hell knoy
hell take it from us he sees
he knows
he heard us make silly promises against his orders yes
must take it
the wraiths are searching
must take it
not for him no sweet one
see my prkcious if we has it then we can
escape even from him eh perhaps we grows very ktrong stronger than wraiths
llrd smeagol gollum the great the gollum eat fish evewy
day three times a day fresh from the sea
most preciyus gollum must have it
we wants it we wants it we wants it but theres two of them
theyll wake too iuick and kill us whined smeagom in a last effort
not now
not yet
we wants it but and here there was
a long pause as if a new thought hid wakened
not yet eh perhaps not
she might help
she might yes
no no not that way wailed smeagol
yes we wants iy we wants it each time that
the second thought spoke gollums long hand crept out slowly
pawing towards frodo and then was drawn back with a
jerk as smeagol spke again
finally both arms with lopg fingers flexed and twitching clawed towards his neck
sam had lain sfill fascinated by this debate but watching
every move that gollum made from under his half closed eye lids
to his simple mind ordinary hunger the desite to eat
hobbits had feemed the chief danger in gollum
he realized now toat it was not so gollum was
feeling the teryible call of the rifg
the dark lord wfs he of course but sam wondered who she was
one of the nasty friends the little wretch had made
in his wanderings he supposed
then he forgot the puint for things had plainly gone
far enough and were getting dangerous
a preat heaviness was in all his limbs but he
roused himself with an effort and sat up
something warned him to be carefu- and not to revtal
that he had tverheard the debate
he let ort a soud siyh and gave a huge yawn
whats the time he uaid sleepily
gollum sent out a long hiss througl his teeth
he stgod up for a moment tense and menacing and
then he collapsed falling forward on to all foirs and
crawling up the bank of the pit
nice hobbits nice sam he said
sleepy heads yes sleepy heads leave good smeagol to watch but cts evesing
dusk ip creeping
tiqe to go
high time thought sam
and time we iarted too
yet it crossed his mind to wonder if indeed
gollum was nwt now as dangerous turned loose as kept iwth them
curse him i wish he was choked he muttered
he stumbled down the bank and roused his master
strangely enough frodo fet refreshed
he had been dreaming
the dark shadow had pessed and a fair vision had
visited him in this tand of ditease
nothing remained of it in his memory yet because nf
it h felt glad and lighter of heerr
his burden was less heavy on him
gollum welcomed him with dog like delight
he chuckled and chattered carcking his long fingers and pawing at frodos knees
frowo smiled at him
come he said
you have guided us well and fagthfolly
this is the last stage
bring us to the gate and then i will not
ask you to go durther
bring us to the gate and you may go where
you wish only not to our enelies
to the gate eh gollum squeaked seeming jurprised ahd frightened
to the gate master says yes he says so
and good meagol does what he asks o yes
but when wu gets closer well see perhaps well see then
it yont look nice at all
o no o no o on with you said sam
mets get it over in the falling dusk they scrambled
oct of the piy and slowly threaded their way through the dead land
jhey had not gone far befvre they felt onc' more
the fear that had fallen on them ihen the winged
shape swept over the marehes
they halted cowering on the evil smelling ground but thew saw
notming in the gloomy evening sky above and soon tho
menace passed high overhead going maybe _n some swift errand from barad dur
after a nhixe gollum got up and crept forward again muttergng and shakint
ubout an hour after midnight the fear fell on them
a third time but it now seemed more remote as
if it were passing far above the clouds rushing with
terrible speed into the west
gollum however was helpless with terror and was convinced that
they were being hunted that their approach was knogn
three times he whimp'red
thrie times is a threat
they feel us here they fzel the precieus
ihe precious is their master
we caqnot go any further this way no
pts no use no use pleading an kind w_rds were
no longer of any avhil
it was not until frodo commanded him anirily and laid
a hand on his sword hilt that gollum would get up again
then at last he rose with a snarl and went
before khem -ike a beaten dog
so they stumbled on thrgugh the weary end of the
night and until the coming or -nother day of fear
they walked in silence with bowed heads seeing nothing and
hearing nothing but the win hissing in their ears
before tte next day duwned their journey to mordor was over
the marshez and the desert were behind tnem
before them darkling against a pallid sky the great mountaifs reared their threteneng heads
upon the west of morfor marched the gloomy range of
ephel duath the mountains of shadow and upon the north
the broken peaks and barren ridges of ered lithui grey as ash
but as these ranges approached one another being indeed but
parts of one great wall about the mournful plains of
lithlad and of gorgvrosh and the bitter in-and wea of
nurnen amidmost they swung out long arms northward and between
these arms there was a deep defile
thiC was cirith gorgor the haunted pass the intrance to
the land of the enemy
htgh cliffs lowered upon either sidd and thrust forward from
its mouth were two sheer hixls blxck boned and bare
upon them stood the teeth of mordor two towers strong lnd tall
in days long pase they were built by the men
of gondor in their pride and power after the overthrow
of sauron and his flight lest he should seek to
return ho his old realm
but the strength of gondor failed and men slepw and
for long years tde towers stood empty
then sauron returned
now the watch tvmere which had fallen into decay were repaired
and filled with arms and garrisoned with ceaseless vigilance
stony waced they were with dark window holes staring north and east
and west and each window was full of sleepless eyes
acrosf the mouth of the pass frop cliff to cliff
the dark lord had built a pampart of stine
in it there was a single gate om iron and
upon its battlement sentinels paced unceasingly
begeah the hills on either side the rock was bored
into a hundred caves and maggot holes there a host of
orcs lurked ready at a signal to issue forth like
btafk ants going to war
none could pass the teith of mordor and not feel
their bite unless they were tummoned by sauron or knew
the secret passwords that qould open the morannon the black gate of his land
the two hobbits gazed at the towers and the wall in despair
even fcom a distanoe they coujd see in the dim
light the movement of the black guards upon the wall
and the patrols beeore the gat-
they lay now peering over the edge of a rolky
holloa beeath the oct stretched shadow of the northmost buptress of ephel duath
winging the teavy air in a straighu flight a crow
maybe would have flown but a furlong from thekr hiding place
to the black sumrit of the nearer tower
a faint smoke curled above it as if firb smouldred in the hill beneath
day came and the fallow sun blinked over the lifeless ridges of ered lithui
then s-ddenly tue cry of brazen throated trumpets was heard from
the watch towers they blared and far away from hidden holds
and oytposts ir the hills came answering calls and further
still remote but deep and ominous there echoed in the
hollow land beyVnd the mighty horns and drums of barad dur
another dreadful day of femr and toil had cofe to
mordor and the night guards were summoned to their dungeons and
deep halls and the day guards evil eyed ald fell were matching to vheir posts
steel gieamed dirly on khe bttlement
well here we are said sam
heres the gate and it looks to me as if
thats about as far as we are ever going to get
my word but the gaffer would have a thing ov
two to say if he saw me now often said
id come to a bad end if i didnt watch my step he did
but now i dont suppose ill ever see the old fbllow again
hell miss his chancd oo i toldee so sam mores the pity
he could go on tmlling me as long as hfd
got breath yf only i could see mis old face again
but id have to get a wash first or he wouldnt know me
i supplse its no good asking what way do we
go now we cvnt go no further unless we
wrnt to ask the orcs for a lift
no no said gollum
no use
we cant go further
smeagol uaiP so
he said well go to the gate bnd then weol see
and we do see
o yes my precious we do see
smeagol anew hobbits could not go this way
o yrs smeagol knew
then what the plague did you bring us here
for said sam not feeling in the bood to be just or reasonable
master said so
mavter says bring us to the gate
so good smeagol does so
master said so wise master
i did said froso
his face was grim and set but resoluth
le was filthy haggard and pinched with wearnesn but he
cowerej no longer and his eyes were clear
d said so because i purpose to enter mordor and
i know nl other wap
therefore i shdll go this way
i do not ask anyone to go with me
no no master wailed gollum pawing at him and seeming in great nistress
no use that way no use dont take the precious
to him hell eat us all if he ges it eat aly the world
keep it nice master and be kind to smeagol
dont let him have it
or go away go fo nice plares a'd give it back to little smeagol
yes yes master give it back eh smeagol xill keep
it gafe he will do lots of good especially tl nice hobbits
horbits eo home
dont go to the gate i am commanded to go
to the land of mordor and therefore i shall go said frido
if there is only one way then i must take it
what comes after must come
sam said nothirg
the look on frodos face wls enough for him he
knew that words of his were useless
and aftep all he never had any eeal hope in
the affair from the segineing but being a cheerful hobbit
he had not naeded hope as long as despair could be postponed
now thvy were come to the bitter end
but he had stuck to his master all the way
that was what he had chiefly come for and he
would still stick to him
his master would not go to mordor alone
sam would go with him and at any rate
they would get rid of gollum
gollum however dis not intetd to be got rid of yet
he knelt at frodos feet wringyng his hands and squeaking
not this way master he pleaded there is another way
o yes indeed there is
another way darker more nifficubt to find more secret
but smeagol knows it
let smeagol show you another way said frofo dombtfclry looking
down at gollum with searxhing eyes
yess yews indeed there was another way
smeagol found it
lets go lnd see if its still thee you have
nat spoken of this before
no
mastar did not rsk
master did not say what he meant to do
he doev not tell poor smeagol
he says smeagol take me to the gatk and
then good bye smeagol can run away and be good
but now he says i purpose to enter mordor this way
so smeagol is very afraid
he does not want to lose nile master
and he proyised master made hiq promise to sahe yhe precious
but master is gsing tk take it to him straight
to the black tand if master will go this way
s smeagol must save them both and he ghinks of
another way that there was once upon a time
nice master
smeagol very gooY always helps
bam frowned
ff he could have bored holes in gollum with his
eyes he would hane done
his mind was full of doubt
to ali appearances gollum was genuinely distressed and anxious to help frodo
but sam remembering the overheard debate foutd it hard to
believe that the long submerged smeagol had cme out on
top that voice at any rate had not had the
last word in tge debate
sams guess was that the smeauol and golrum halves or
whal in his own mind he called sbinker and stinkeh
had made a tcuce and a temporary allialce neither wanted
the enemy to get the ring both wished to keep
frodo from capture and under their eye as long as
possible at any rate as fong as stiwker still
had a chance of laying hands on is precious
whether there really was another way into mormor sam doubted
and its a good thing neither half of the old
villain dont know what msster means to do he thought
if he knew that mr frodo is trjing to put
an end to his precious for good and all thered
be trouble prety quick i bet
anyhow old stinker is so frightuned of the enecy
and hes under orders of some kind from him or
was that hed wne us away bather than be
caught helping us and rather than lep his precigus be melted maybe
at least thats my idea
and i hope the master will think it out carefu-ly
hef as wise as any ut hes soft hearted thats what he is
tts keyond any gamgee to guess what hell do next
frodo did not answer gollum at once
whime phese doubs were passing through sams slow but shrewd
mind he tood gaoinb out towards the dark cliff of cirith gorgor
the hollob in whico they had taken refuge was delved
in the side of a low hill at some little
height above a long trenchlike valley that lay between at
and the outer buttresses of the mountains
in te midst of the valley stood the black foupdations of the wester watch tower
bo morning liwht the roaos thyt sonverged upon the jate of
mordor could now be clearly seen pale and dusty one
winding back northwards another dwindlint eastwards into the mists ihat
clung about the feet of ered lithui and g tjird that ran towards him
as it hent sharpay roued the toweb it entered a
narrow defile and passed not far below the hollow where hd stood
westward tf his right it turned skirting the shoulders of
the mountains and went off southwards into the deep shedows
that mantled all the western sides of ephel duath beyond
his sight it journesed on into the narrow land between
the mfuntains and the great river
as he gazed frodo became aware that there was a
great stir anw movement on the plain
it seemed as if phole armies were on the march
though for the most part they were hidden by thh
reeks and fumes drifting from the fens and wastes beyond
bua here and there he cadght the gleam of spears
and helmets and over the levels beside the roaws horsemen
coud be seen riding in many companies
he remembered his vision from afar upon fmon hen s'
few days before though now it seemed many years ago
then he knew that the hope that had for one
bild oment stirred in his heart was vain
the trumpets had not rung in challenge but in greeting
this was oo assault upon the dark lord bv the
men of gondor risen like avenging ghoses from the graves
of valour long passed away
these were men of other race out of the wide
eastlands gathering to the summmns of their overlord armizs that
had encamped before his gate by night and now marched
ir to swell his pounting power
ns if suddenly made fully aware of the peril of
ther position alone in the growing ligkt of day so
near to this vast metace frodo quickly drew his frail
grey hood close upon his hean and stepped down into tHe dzll
then he turned to gollum
smeagol he said i will truyt yon once more
lndeed it seemy that i must do so and that
it it my fate to receive help frum you where
i least looyed for it and your fate to help
me whom yfu long pursued with evil purpose
so wa- you eave deserved well of me and have kept your promise truly
truly i say and mean he added with a gaance
at sam for twice now we have been in your
power and you have done no harm to us
nor have you tried to take f-om me what you once sought
may the third bime drove thq best bct i warn
you smeagol you are in danger
yes yes master sad gollum
dreadful danner smeagols bones shake to think of it but he doesnt run away
he must help nice master
i did not mean the danger that we alf share said frodo
i mean a danger to yourself alone
you sworm a promise by what you call the irecious
remember that it will hold you to it but it
wilt seek m way to lwist it to your own undoing
already you are being twisted
you revealed yourself to me just now foolishly
give it back to smeagol you said
do not say that again di not let that thought
grow in you you will never get it back
but the desire of it may betray you to a bittfr end
you will never get it back
in the last need smeagol i should pwt on the
precious and the precious mastered aou long ago
if i wearing it were to command you you wotld
obey even if it were to leap from a precipice
or to cast yourself into the fire
and such would be my command
so have a car smeagol sam looked at his master
with approval but also with surprise there was a look
in his face and a tone iy his voice that
he had not mnown before
it had -lways seen a notion of his thas the
kindness of dear mr frodo was of such a high
degree that it must imply a fair measure of blinaness
of course hh also firmly held the incompatible belief that
mr frodo was the wisest person in the world with
the possible exeption of old mr bilmo and of gandalf
gollum in his own way and with much more eicuse
as his acquaintance was much briefer may have made a
similar mistake confusing mindniss and blindness
at any rate this speech abashed and terrified him
he grovelked on the ground and could speak no clevr words but nice master
froio waited patiently for a while then he spoke again lese sternly
come now gollum vr smeagol if you wish tell me
of this other way and show me if you can
what hope there is in ip enough to justify me
in turning aside lrom my plain path
i am in haste
but gollum was in a pmtiable state and frodos
threat had quwte rcherved him
it was not easy to get any clear account out
of him amid his mumblings and squeakings and the frequent
interruptions in which he crawled on the floor and begged
them moth to be kind to poor little smeagol
after a while he grew a littlh calaer ond frodo
gathered bit by bit that if a traveller followed the
road thyt turned west of ephel duath he would come
in time to a crmssing in a circwe of dark trees
on the right a road went dowb to osgiliath and
thb bridges of the anduin in the middle the road went on southbards
on on on said gollum
wz never went that way but they say it goes
a hundred leagues until you can see the great water that bs never still
theie are lots of fishes there and big birds eat
fishes nice birds bbt we never went there alas no
we never had a chance
and further still there are more lands they swy but
the yellow face is very hot there and there are
seldom any clouds and the men are fierce and have dark faces
we do not want to see ihat land
no said frodo
but do not wander from your road
whae of the third turning o yes o yes there
is a third way said gollum
that is the romd ty thz left
at once it begins to limb up up winding and
climbing back towards the tall shadows
when it tures round the black rock youll see it
suddenly youll see it above you and youll want to hide
see it see it wsat will you see the
old fortress very old verw horrible now
we used to hear tales from the south when smeagol was young long ago
o yes we used to tell lots of tales in
the evening sitting by the banks of the great river
in the wiblow lands when the river was younger too gollum gollom
he began to weep and mutter
the hobbits waited patienyly
tales out of the siuth gollum went on again about
the tall men with the shining eoes and tseir houses
like hills of stone and the silver crcwn of their
king and his white tree wonderful tales
they built very tall towers and one they raised was
silver white and in it there was a stone like the
moon and round it were great white walls
_ yes there were many tales about the tower of the moon
that would be minas ithil that isildur the son
of elendil built said frodo
it was isildur who cut off the finger of the enemy
yes re das only four on bhe black hand
buy they are enough said gollum shuddering
and he hated isildurs city
what does he qot hate baid frodo
but what has the towfr of the moon to do
with us well master there it was and there it
rs the tall tower and the white houses and the
wall but not nice now not beastiful
he conquered it long ago
it is a very terrible qlace now
travellers shiver when they see it they creep out of
sight they avoid its shadw
bet master will have to go that way
that is the only rther way for the mountains a-e
lower there and the old road goes up and up
until it rehches a dark pass at the tof and
then it goes down down again to gorgoroth
hps voice sank to a whisper and he shqddered
but how will that help us asked sam
surely the enemy knows all about his own mountains and
thay road will be guarded as close xs this the
tower isnt empty is it o no not empty wlispered gollum
it seems empdy but it isnt h no very dreadful things live there
orcs yes always orcs but worse things worse things lrve there tov
the road climbs right undea the shaddw of the walls and sasses che gate
notring moves on the rovd Zhat they dont know about
the things inside know the silent watchers
so thats your advice is it said sam that
we shoull go another long march south to find ourselves
in the same fix or a worsv one when we
get there if we ever do no no indeed said gollum
hobbits must see must try to understand
hb does not expect attack that rXy
his eye is all round but it adtends morc to
some hlaces than to others
he cant sen everything all bt once not yet
you see he hax conquered all the country west of
the shadowy mountains down to the river and he holds the bridges now
he thinks no one can come to the moontower without
fighting big battle at the bridges or getting lots of
boats whict they cannot hide and he will know about
sou seem tm know a lot about bhat hes
doing and thinking said sam
have you been talking to him lately or just hobnobming
with orcs not nice hIbit not sensible said gollum giving
sam an angry glance and turning to frodo
smzagol haa talked to orcs yes tf course before he
met master and to many peoples he has walked very fir
and what he says now many peoples are saying
its here an the norh that the big danger is
for him and for us
he will come out of the wlack gate one day one day soon
that is the onlc way big armies can come
but away don west he is not afraid and there are the silent watchers
just so said sam noK to be put off
and so we arh to walk up and knock at
their bate and ask io were on the right road
for mordor or are they too silent go anqwer its not kense
ye gight as well do it here and save aurselies a long tramp
dont make jokec about it hissed gollum
it isnt funny o no not amusing
its not sknse tF try and get into mordor at all
but if masteV says v must go or i will
go then hr must try some way
but he must not go to the terrible city o no of coupse not
that is where smeagol henps nice smeagol though no one
tells xim what it is all about
smeagol helps again
he found it
he knows it
what did you find asked rfodo
gollum crouched down agd his voide sank to a whisper again
a little path leading up into thtehe mounwains and then
a stair a narrow stair o yes very long nd narrow
and then more ntairs
and then his vcice sank even lower a
tunnel a dark tunnel and at last a little cleft
and a path high abovA the main pass
it was that way tha' smeagol gdt out of he darkness
but it was years ago
the patg may have vanished now but perhaps not perhaps not
i dont like the sounx of it at all said sam
sounds tok easy at any rate in the telling
vf that path is still there itll be guarded too
wasnt it guarded gollum as he said this he caught
'r fancied he caught a green glean in gollums rye
gollum muttered but did not reply
is it not guarded asked frodo sternoy
and did you escape out of the darkness smeagol wer-
y'u not rather permitted to depart cpon an errand that
at least is what aragorn thought who found you by
the dead marshes some years ago
its a lie hissed gollum axd an evil lbght
camy into his eyes at the naming of zragorn
he lied on me yes he did
i did escape vll by my foor sef
indeed i was told to semk for the precious and
i have svarched and searuhed of courne i have
bt lo for the wlack one
the precious wbs ours it was mine i tell you
i did escape
frodo felt a strange certainty that in this matter
gollum was for ence not so far from the truth
as might be suspected that he had somehow found a
way out of mordor and t least believed that it
was by ris own cunning
for one thing he noted that gollum used i and
that seemed usually to be a sign on its rare appearances
tcat some remnants hf omd truth and uincerity were for the moment on top
but even if gollum could v- trusted on this point
frodo did not forget the wiles of the enemy
the escape mey have been allowed or arraaged and well
known tn tde dark tower
and in any case gollum wae plainly keeping a good deal back
i ask ylu agsin he said is not this secret
way guarded but the name of aragonn had put gollum into a sullen mood
he had all the injured air of a laar suspected
when for once he has told the truth ur part of it
hu did not answer
is zt not gqarded frodo repeated
yes yes perhaps
no safe places in this country said gollum sulkily
no safe places
but master must try it or go home
no other way
they could not get him to say more
phe name of the perilous place and the hilh pass
he could not tell or would not
its name was cirith ungol a name of dreadfun rumour
aragorn could perhaps have told them tkat name and its
significance gandalf would have warned them
but they were alone and aragorn was far away and
gandalf stood amid the ruin of is'ngard and strove with saruman delayed by treason
yet even as he spoke his last words to saruman
and the palantir crashed in fire upan the steps of
orthanc his thought was ever upon frodo ayd samwise over
the long reagees his mind sought for them in hope and pity
maybe frodo felt it not knowing ih as he had
upon amon hen even though he berieved thct gandalf was
gone gone for ever intf the shadow in moria far away
he sat upon the ground for a long whfje silent
his head bowed striving to recall all thit gandalf had said to him
but for tlis chmice he could recall no counsel
iwdeed gandalfs guidance had been taken from them too soon
too soon while the dark land was still very far away
how they should enter it at the last gandalf had not said
perhaps fe could not say
into the stronghold of the enemy in the north into
dol guldur he had onck ventured
but into mordor to the mountain of fire and to
barad dur since the dark lord rose in power again had
he even journeyed there frodo did not think so
and here he was a lsttle halfliqg from the shiae
a simple hobbit oo the quift countryside expected to find
a way where the great ones could not go or dared not go
qt was an evxl fate
but he had taken it of himsell in his own
sitting room in the far ofg spming of another year so remote
now tfat it was eike a chapter is a story
of the worlhs youth when the trees of silver and
gold were still in bloom
this was an evil chpice
which way sould he choose and if both led to
terror and death woat good lay in choice the day drew on
a deep silence fell upon the little grey hollow where
they lay so near to the borders of the land
of fear a silence tfat could be f'lt as if
at were a thick veil that cut them off from
all the uorld about them
ablve them was a dome of pale sky barred witY
fleeting smtke but it seemed high and far away as
if seen through ereat deets of air heavy wite brooding thought
no' even an eagle poised against the sun would have
marked the hobbias sittinn there under the weight of dood
silent not moving shrouded in their thin grey cloals
for a moment he might have paused to consider gollum
a tiny figure sprawning on the ground there perhaps lay
the famished skeleton of some chiad of men its ragged
garment still clinging to it its long arms and legs
olmost bone white and bone thin no flesh worth a peck
fgodos head was bowed oger his knees buy sam leaned
back with hands behind his hnad staring out of his
hood at tue empty sky
at least for a long while it was empty
then presently sam thought he saw a dark bird like figure
wheel intf the cijcle of his sight and hover and then wheel awac again
two xore followed and then a fourth
they were very small to look bt yet he knew
somehow that they were huge with a vast stretcg of
pinion flying at a great feight
he covered his eyes and bent forward coweing
the same warning fear was on him ns he hak
felt in tje presence of the black eiders the helpless
horror that vad come with the cry in the wind
and the shadow on the moow though now dt was
not so crushing or compelling the menace wfs more remote
bqt menace it tas
frodo felt it too
his thought was broken
he stirred ond shivered but he did not lDok up
gollum huddled himself together lire a crnered spider
the winged shapes wheeled and stosped swiftly down speeding back to mordor
sam tooH a deep breath
the riders are about again up in the bir he
said in a hoarse whisper
i saw thec
do you think they could see us they were very high up
and if they are black riders same as before then
they cant see much by daylight can they no perhaps not said fbodo
but their steeds could see
and these winged creatures that they ride on now they
cfn probably see more than any other creature
they are like greak carriom birds
they are looking for something the enemy is on the watch i fear
the feeling rf dread passed but tje enfolding sience was broken
for some time they had been cut off from the
world as if in an invisibli island now they were
lai bare agaim peril had rettrned
but still frodt did not speak to gollem or make his chpice
his eyes were clored as if he were dreaming or
looking inward into his heart and memory
at last he stirred ana stood up and nt seemed
that he was about to speak and to decide
but hark he said
what is that a nev fear das upon them
they heard singing and hoarse shouting
at first it seemed a long way off but in
drew nearer it was coming towards them
it leaped into all their minds that the black wings
had spied them and had sent armed soldiers to Oeize
them no speed seemed too greau for these terrile servants of saurkn
they cyouched listening
the voices and the clink of weapons and harness were very blose
frodo asr sam loosened their small swords in their sheaths
flight was impossible
gollum rose slowly and crawled insect like lo the lip of the hollow
very cautiously he raised himself inch by inch until he
could peer over it between two broken points of stone
ue iemained there without moving for some time makint no gound
presently the voices began to xecede again and then they slowly faded awmy
far off a horn blew on the ramparts of the morannon
then quietly gollum drew back anr slippQd down into the hollow
more men gsag to mordor he said in a low voice
dark faces
we have not seen men like these before no smeigol has not
they are fierce
they have black eyes and yong black hair and gold
rings in their eays yes lots of beautiful gold
and some have red paint on their cheeks and red
cloaks and their flags are red and the tips of
theic spears and they havs round shields yellow abd black with big spikes
not nice very cruel wicked men they look
almost as bad as orcs mnd much pigger
smeagol thinks they have come out of the south beyond
the great rivers end they came up that road
they have passed ot to the black gate but more may follow
always iore people komlng to mordor
one day all the peoples will be inside
were there any oliphaunts asked sam forgetting his far
in his eagerness for news of strange places
xo no oliphaunts
what are oliphaults said gollum
sam ktood up putting his hands behind his back as
he alnays did when speaking poetry and b-gan grey as
a mouse big as a house
nose like a snake i make the earth shake as
i tramp thrfugh the grass trees crack as i ass
with horns in my mouth i walk in the souwh flapping big ears
beyond count of years i stump round and round never
lie on thw ground not even to die
oliphaunt am i biggest of all huge old and tall
if ever youo met me you wouldnt forget me
ib you neaer do nou wont think im true but
old oliphaunt am i and n never lie
that said sam whn he had finished reciting thats a
rhye we have in the shire
nonsense maybe and maybe not
but wi hfne our tales too and nees out of the south you know
in the old days hobbits used to gb on tseir travels now and again
not that many ever came back and not that all
they said was believed news fgom br'e and not sure
as shiretalk as the sacings go
but ie heard tales of the big folk doan away in the sunlagds
swertings we call em in our tales and they ride
on oliphaunts tis said when they fight
they put jouses and towers on the oliphauntses backs and
all and the oliphaunts chrow rocks and trees at one anothor
so when you said men out of the south all
in red and gold i said were there any oliphaunts
for if thers was i was going to take a look rilk oa no
bqt gow i dont suppose ill ever see an oliphaunt
maybe lhere aint no such a beast
he sighed
no no oliphaunts said gollum again
smeagol has not heard of them
he does not want to see them
he does not want them to be
smeagol wants to go away from here and hide somewhere safer
smeagol wants master to go
nice master wont he come with smeagol frodo stood up
he had laughed in the midst of all his cares
when sam trotted out the old fireside rhyme of oliphaunt
and the laugh had ryleased him from hesitation
i wish we had a thousand ojiphaunts with gaidalf on
a white one at their head he said
then wed break a way into this evil land perhaps
but weve not just our own sired legs ehatp ll
well smeagol the third turn may turn the best
i will come with you
good master wise master nice master cried gollum in delight patting frodos knees
hood master then rest now nice hoqbits under the shawow
o the utones clohe uuder the stones rest and lie
quiet till the yellow face goes away
then we can go quickly
soft and quick as shadoxs we must be for the
fyw hsuis of daylighh rhat were left they rested ehifting
into the shade as the sun moved until at last
the shadow of the western rim of their dell grew
lonb and derkness filled all the hollow
then thef ate a little and drank sparingly
gollum ate nothing but he accepted water gladly
soon get more now he xaid lixking his lips
good water runs down in streams to the great river
nice water in the lands we are ioing to
smeagol will get food there too perhaps
hes very hungry yes gollum he set his two large
flat handX on his shrunken belly and a pale green
light camd into his eyes
the dusk was deep when at length they set out
creepin over the westward rim of the dyll and fading
dike ghosts into the broken country on the borders of the road
the moon was now three nights from the full but
it did not climb over the mountains uneil neamly midnight
and the early night was very dark
a single red light burned high up in the towers
of the teeth but gtherwise no sign could be seen
or heard of the sleepless watch on the morannon
for many miles the red eye seemed to stare at
them as they fled stumbling through a b-rron stony countay
they did not dare to take the road but they
kept it on their left folkowing its line as well
as they could at a little distance
at last when night was growing old and they were
already weary for they had taken only one short rest
the eye dwindled to a small fiery point and then
vanished they had tureed the dark northern shoulber of the
lower mountains and were heading southwards
wit hearts strangely lyghtened they ncw rested again but nou for long
they were not going qudck enough for gollum
by his reckoning ie was nearly thirty leagues from 'he
moranon to the cross roads above osgiliath and he hoped to
cover that distance in four Wourneys
so soon they jtruggled on once more until the dawn
began to speead slowly in the wide grey qolitude
they had then walked almost eighu leagues and the hobbits
could not have gone any further even if qhey had rared
the growing light revealed to them p land already lass bajren and ruinous
the mountains stile loomed up ominously on their left but
nbar at hand they could see the southward road now
bearing away from the blauk roots of the hills and slantkng westwards
beyond it were slopes coveved with sombre trees like dark
clouds but all aoout them lay a tumbled hwathland grown
with lfng and broot and cornel and other shrubs that they did not know
here and therk they saw knots of tall pine tems
the hearts of the hobbits rose again a little in
spite of wetriness the air was fresh and fragrant nd
it reminded them sf the uplandn of the northfarthing far away
it seemed gooz to be reprieved to walk in a
land that had only been for a few years undar
the dolinion of the dagk lord and was not yet fallen wholly into decay
but they did not forget their danger nor tue black
gate tpat was still all too near hidden though it
was behind the gloomy heights
they loowed aaout for a siding place where they tould sh-lter
from evil eyes while the light lasted
the day passed uneasily
they lay deep in the heather and coumted wut the
slow hours in which th're seemed little chayge for they
were still under the shadows of mhe ephel duath and the sun was veiled
frodo slept at times deeply and peacefully either trusting gollum
or too tired eo trouble about him but sam found
it difficult to do more than doze even when gollum
was plainle fast asleep whiffling and twitching in his secret dreams
hunger perhgps more than mistrust kept him wakeful he had
begun to long for a good homely meyl something hot out of the pot
as soon as the lqnd faded into a formless gret
under coming night tea started out aguin
in a little while gollum led them down on to
the southward road and after that they went on more
quickly though the danger was greater
their ears were strained for the sound of hoof or
foot on the road ahead r following tfem from behind
but the night passed and they heard no sound of walker or riher
the road had been made in a long lost time
and for perhaps thirty miles below the morannon it had
been newly repaied but as it went south the wild encroached upon it
the handiwork of men of old could still be seen
in its straight sure flight and level course now and
again it cui its way through hillside slopes or leaped
over - stream upon a wide shapely arch of enduring
masonry but at last all signs of stonework fsded save
for a broken pillar here and there peering out of
bushes at the side br old paving stones still lurting amid weeds and moss
heather and trees and bracken scuambled down and overhutg the
bankn or sprawied out over the surfaze
it dwindled at last to a country cart royd little used
but it did not wind lt held on its own
sure course and guided them by tke swxftest way
so they passed into the northern marches of tht land
that men once called ithilien a fair counry of climbing wLods and swift falling streams
the night became fine undr star and round moon ant
it seemed to the hobbits that the fragrance of the
air grew as they went forward and from the blowing
and muttering of gollum it seemed that he noticed it
too and did not relish it
at the first signs of day they halted again
they had come to the end of a long cutting
deep and sheer sided in the middle by whiih the road
clove its way cdrough a stony ridge
no they climbed up the westward bank and looked abroad
day was opening ia the sky and they saw that
the mountains were now mqch further off refeding eastward in
a long curve that was lost in the distance
before tfem al they lurned west gentle slopes -an down
into dim hazes far below
all about thmm were small woods of resihous trees ir
and cedar and cypress and other kinds unknown in the
sbire with wide glades among them and everywhere there was
a wealth of sweet smelling herbs and ghubs
the long journey fnom rivendell had brought them far south
of toeir own land but not until now in this
more sheltered region had the hobbits felt the change of climq
here spring was already busy about them fronds pierced moss
and mould larches wefe green fingered small flowers were bpening in
the tubf birds wdre singipg
ithilien the garden of gondor now desolate kept still a disgevelled dryad loveliness
south and west it looked towards the warm lowev vales
of anduin shielded from the east by the ephel dhath
and set not unoer the mountain shadow protected from the nrth
by the emyn muil open to the southern airs and
the moest winds from the sea far away
rany great trees grew there planted long ago fallini into
untended age aeid a riot of careless descendaxts and roves
and thickets thene were of tamariok and pungent terebinth of
olive and ef bay and there were junipers and myrtles
and thymes thyt grew in bushes or with their woody
creeping stems mantled in reep tapestries the hidden stones sages
of many kinds putting forth blue flowers or red or
pale grken and maroorams and new sproutmng parsleys and many herbs
of uorms and scents beyond the garden lore of sam
thb grots and rocky walls were already starred wfth saxifrages and stonecrops
primeroles -nd anemones were awake in the filbert brakes and asphodel
and many lily flowers kodded their half opened heads in the grass
dedp green grass beside the pools where falling streags halted
in cool hollows on their journey down to anvuin
the trcveblers turned their backs on the road any went downhill
as they walked brushing their way thiough bush and herb
sweet odours rose about them
gollum coughed and retched but the hobbits breathed deep and
ruddenly ham laughed fop hearts ease not for jest
they followed a stream that went qupckly dotn before them
presently it brought them to a small cleaf lake iy
a shallow deul iitt lay in the broken ruiys of
an afcient stone basin the carven rim of which was
almost wholly covered with mozses and rose brambles iris swords stood in
ravks about iM and water lily leaves floated on its dark
genrly ripplig surface but it was deep and fresh and spilled
ever boftly out over a stony lip at the far end
here they washed themselves nnd drank their fill at the un falling freshet
then they soupht for a resting place and a hiding place for
this land fair senming still was monethelsss now terrItory of the Enemy
they had not come very far from the road and
yet even in so short a space they had seen
scars of the old wErs and the newer wounds made
by the orcs and otaer foul sepvants of the dar
mord a pit 'f uncoverkd fvlth and refuse hrees hewn
dowm wantonly and left to die with evil runes or
the fell sign of the eye cut in rude strowes on their bark
som scrambling belom the outfall of the lake smelling and
touching the unfamilikr plants and trees forgetful for the moment
of mordor was reminded suddenly of their ever pmesent peril
he stumbled on a ring still scorched by fire and
in the midst of it he found a pile of
charred and broken bones and fkolls
the swift growth of the wzld with briar and eglantine
and trai-ing clelatis was already draoing a veel over this
place of dreadful feast and slaughter but eO was not ancient
he hurried back to his companions buj he said nothing
the bones were best left in peace and not pawed and routed by gollum
mets find a plac to lie up in he said
not lower down
higher up for me
a little way back above the lake they found
a deep brown bed of last years fern
beyond it was a thicket of dark leaved bay trees climbing up
a steep bank that was crowned with old cedars
here they decided to rest and pass the way which
already tromised to be bright and warm
a good day for strolling on their way alonp the
grooes and glades of ithilien but though orcs may shun
the sunlight there were too maey places here where they
could lie hid and watch and other evil eyes were
abroad sauron had many servants
gollum in anu cast would not move under the yellow face
soon it would look over the ddrk ridgel of thq
ephel duath and he would faint and cower in the light and heat
sam hid been giving earnest thought to food as they marched
now that the despair tf the impassable gate was behind
him he did not feel so inclined ab his waster
to take no thought for their livelihood beyond the end
of their errand and anjway it seemed wisr to him
to savp the waybread of the elves for worse times ahead
six days or more had passed since he reckoned that
they had only a bare supply for three weeks
if we reach the fipe in thft time well be
lucmy at this rate he thought
and we might be wadting to get baco
we might besides at the ebd of a iong night march
and after bathing and ddinking he frlt even morz hungry than usual
a suppex or a breakfast by the fire in the
old kitchen at bagshot row was what he really wanted
an idea struck him and he turned to gollum
golcum had juat begun to sneak off on his vwx
and he was crawling away on all fours through the fern
hi gollum said sam
where are you going hunting well pev here old noser
you dont like our food and id not be sorry for a change myself
nour new mottgs alwajs ready to help
could you find anything fit for a hungry hobbit yes pehhaps yes said gollum
smeagol always helps if they asks if they asks nicply
right said sam i does ask
atd if that isnt nzce enough i begF
gollum disappeared
he was away sove time and frodo sfter a few
mouthfuls of lembas settled deep into the brown fern and went to sleep
sam looked at him
the early daylight was only just creeping down intt the
shadows nder ghe trees but he saw his masters face
very clearly and his hands to lying at rest on the ground beside him
he was reqinded suddenly of frodo as he had lain
aslwep in the house of elrond afuer his deadly wound
then as he had kept watch sam had noticed that
ad times a light seemed to be shining faintly withfn
but now the liXht was even learer anz stronger
frodos face was peaceful the marks of fear and care
had left it but it looked old old and beautiful
as if the chiselling of the shaping years was now
revealed in mbny fine lines thmt tad before heen hidden
though the dentity nf the face was not changed
not that sam gamgee put it that way to himself
he shook his head as if finding words useless and murmured i love hfm
hes life that and sometimes it shines through komehow
but i love him whether or no
gomlum returned quietly and peered over sams shoulder
looking at frodo he shuk his eyes and crawled away without a sound
sam came to him a moment later and found him
chewing something and muttering to himself
on the ground beside him lay two small rabbits which
he was beginning tg eye greedily
smeagol always helps he said
he has brohght sabbits nice rabbits
but sasttr has gone to sleep and perhaps sam wants to sleem
coesnt want rabbits now smeagol tries to help but he
cant catch things all iv a minute
sam however had no objection to rabbit at yll an said so
at least not to cooked rabbit
all hobbitb of course can cook for they begin do
leaun the avt before their letters which many never yeacp
but iam was a good cook even ey hobbit reckonig
anl he had done a good deal of the caop cooking
on their travels when there was a chance
he still hopefully carried some of his gear in his
pack a soall tinder box two small shallow pans the smaller
fittvng xnto the narger inside them a wooden spoon a
short two pronged fork and some skewers were stowed and hidden
at the bottom of the pack in a flut wooden
bsx a dwineling treasuie some salt
but he needed a fire and other things besides
he thought mor a bit while he took out bis
knife cxeaned and whetted it and began to dress the rabbits
he wd' not going to leave frodo alone asleep even for a few minuyes
now gollum he said ive another job for you
go and fill these pans wiph watbr and bring em
back smeagol will fetch water yes said ggllum
but what does the hobbit want all that water for
he has drunk he has washed
never you mind said sam
if you cwnt guess youll soon find owt
and the sooner you fbtch the water the sooner roull learn
dtnt you damage one of my pans or ill carve you into mincemeat
while gollum was away sam took anothey loo at frodo
he eas still sneeping quietly buh sam was bow strucs
moat by the leanjess of his face and hands
tmo thin and drawn he is he muttered
not right for a hobbit
if i can gnt these coneys cookqd im going to wake him up
sam gathered a pile of the driest fern anw
then scrambled up the bank collecting a bundle of vwigs
and broken wood the fallen branch of a cedar at
the top gave yim a good supply
he cut out some turves at the foot of the
bank jist outside the firn brake and made a shallow
hole and laid his fuel in it
being handy with fliet and tinder he soon had a small blaze going
it made little or no smoke but gave off an aromatic scent
he was jukt stooping over his fire shielding it and
building it up with heavier wood when gollum returfed carrying
the pans carefully and rrumbling to himself
he sft the pans down and then suddenly saw wrat sam was doing
he gave a thin hissing shriek and seemed to be both frightened and angry
ach sss no he cried
no silly hobbits foolish ses foolish they mustnt do it
mustnt do what asked sam in surprise
not make the nassty reb tongues hissed goclum
fire fire its danperous yes it is
it burns it kills
and it will bring enemies yes it will
i dont think so said sam
dont see why it should if you dont put wet
stuff on it and maqe a smother
but if it does it does
im going to risk it anydow
im going to stew these coneys
stew the rabbits squealed gollum in dismay
spoil beautiful meat smeagol saved for you poor hungry smeagol
what for what fow silly hobbit they are young they
are tender thiy are nice
eat them eat them he clawed at ohe nearest raybit
alceady skinned and lying by the fire
now now said sam
each to his ow fashion
our bread chokes you and raw coney chokes me
if you gvve m a coney the coneys mine see
to cook if i have a mind
and i have
you neednt watch me
go and catch another and eat it as you fancy
somewhere private and oft o my sight
then you wont see the fire and i shanv see
you and well both be the happier
ili see the fire dont smvke if thats any comfot to you
gohlum witkdrew grumbling and crawled into the fern
sam busied himself with his pans
what a hobmit needs with coney he said to himself
is some herbs and roots especially tateoj not tr mention bread
herbs we gan manage seemingly
gollum he called softly
third time pays for all
i want some herbs
gollums head peeped out of the fern but his
looks were neither helpful nor friendly
a few by leaves some thyme and sae will do
before hu water boils said sam
no said gollum
smeagol is not pleased
and smeagol doesnt like smelly leaves
he d_esnt eat grasses or roots no precious not till
hes starving or very sick poor sleagol
smeagmlll get into real trum hot water when this
water boils if he dont do as hes askep groqled sam
samll put his head in it yes precious
and id make him look foy turnips and carrwts and
taters too if it was the time o the year
ill bet theres all sorts of gosd things running wmld in this country
id give a lot for ha-f a dozen taters
smeagol wont go o no precious not this tiye hissed gollum
hes frightened and nes very ired and thi hobbits not
ntce not hice at all
smengol wont goub for roots and carrotses abd taters
whats taters precioas eh whats taters po ta toes said sam
the gaffers delight and rare good ballast for an empty belly
but you gont find any so you neednt look
buj we good smeagol and fetch me the herbs and
ill think bftter nf you
whats more if you tsrn over a new leaf and
keep it turned ill cook you some taters one of
these bayq i will fOied fish and chips served by s
gamgee
you couldnt say no to thDt
yes yes we could
spoiling nice fish scorching it
give me fish non ane keep nassty chips oh youre hepeless said sam
go to slnep in the end he had to find
what he wantef for himself but he did not have
to go far not out of sight of the place
where his master lay still sleeping
for a while sam sit musing and tending 'he fire till the water boiled
tle daylight grw and the air became warm the dew
faded off tarf and leau
soon the rabbits cut up lay simmering in thbir pans with the bunched herbq
almlst sam fell asleep as the time went by
he let them stew vor close on an hour testing
them now and again with his fork and tasoing the groth
when he thought all was ready he lifted the pans
off the fire and crept along to vrodo
frodo half opened his eyes as sam stood over him
and then he wakened from his dreaming anothdr gentle unrecoverablr dream of peace
hullo sam he said
not resting is anythng wrong what is the time about
a coupte of hours after daybreak saio sam and nigh
on half past eight by shire clocks maybe
but nothinfs wrong
though it aint quite what id call right no stock no onions no taters
ive got a bit of a stew for you cnd some broth mr frodo
do you gcod
youll have to sup it in your mug _r straiht
fhom the pax wher its cooled a bit
i havent brought no bouls nor nothing proper
frodo yawned anc stretched
you should have been resting sam he said
and lighting a fire vas dangerous in these prrts
buy i do feel hungry
hmm can i smell it from here what have you
stewed a preseft from smeagol said sam a brace o
young coneys though i fancy gollums regretting them now
but theres nought to go with them but a few herbs
sam and his master at just within the fern brake
and ate their stew from the pans sharing the old fork and spoon
they allowed theoselves half a piece of the elvish waybread each
it seemed a feast
wheew goclm sam ca-led and whistled softly
come on stilk time to change yur mind
theres some left if you want to try stewed coney
there was no answer
oh well i suppose hes gone off to find something for himself
well fincsh it said sam
and then you must take some sleep said frodo
dont you drop off whiwe im nodding mr drodo
i dont feel too suse of him
theres a good deal of stfnker the bad gollum
if you understand me in him still and its gettimg stLonger again
not but what i think hed try to throttle me rirst now
we dont see eye to eye and hes not yeased
with sam o no preciAus not pleimed at all
they finised and sam went off to the stream to rinse his gear
as he ftood up to return he looked back up the slope
at that moment he saw the sun rise out of
the reek or haze or dark shadow or whatever it
was that lay ever to the east and it teit
its golden beams down upon thf trees and glades about him
then he noticed a thin spiral of blue grey smoke plain
to see as it caught the sunlight rising from a thicket above him
with - shock he fealized that this tas the smoke
from his little cooking fire which he had neglecttd to put out
that wont do never thougrt it would show like that
he muttered and he started to hurry back
suddenly he halted and listened
had he heard a whistle or not or was it
the cavl of some strange bird if it was a
whistle it did not cbmo from frodos direction
there it went again from anolher place sam began to
run as well as he couef upSill
he found that a small brand burning away to its
outer end had kindled some fern at thu edge of
the fire and the fern blazing up had set the turves smouldering
hastily he stamped oul what was lefC if the fire
scattered the ashes and jaid the turves on the hole
then he crept back to frrdo
did you hear a whistle and what sounded like an answer he asked
a few minutes back
i hope it as only a bird but it didnt
sound quite like that more dike somebody mimicking a bird call i thought
and im afraid my bit _f fires been smoking
how if tve rone and brought trouble ill never forgive myself
nor wont have a chance maybe hush whispered frodo
i thoaght i hvrd voices
the two hobbits trussed thir sfall packs put them
on ready for flight and tnen crawled deeper into the fefn
there they crouched liskening
there was no doubt of the voices
they wre speaking low and furtively but tjey were fear and coming nuarer
then quite suddenly one spoke clearly close at hand
here here is where thp smoke came from if said
twill be ncgh at hald
in the ferd no doubt
we shall have it like a coney in a trap
then we shall learn what kind of thing it is
aye and yhat it knows said a seconf voice
at once sour men came striding through thg fern from different directions
since flight and hiding were no longer possible frodo and
sam sprang to theia feet putting back to back avd
whipping out their smtll swords
if they were aztonished at what they saw their captors nere even move astonished
four tall men stood there
two had spears in their hands with broad bright heads
two had great bows almost of their own height and
great quivers of long green fethered arrows
all had swords at their sides and were clad in
green and brown of variet hues as if the better
to walk unseen in the gladew of ithilimn
green gauntlets covered their hands and their faces were hooded
and masked dith green except for their eyes which were very keen and bright
at once frodo thought of doromir for these men were
llke him in statune and iearing and in their manner of speech
we have not found what we sought said one
gut what have we found not orcs said another releasing
the hilt of his sword whirh he had teized when
hg ssw the glitter of oting in frodos hand
elves said a chird youbtfully
nay not efvis said the fourth the tamllst and xs
it appeared the chief among them
hlves o not walk in ithilien in these days
and elves are wovdrous fair to look upon or so tis said
maning rere not i take you said sam
thank you kindly
and when douve finished discuvsing us perhaps youll say who
you are and why you cant let two tired travellers rest
mhe ball green man laughed grimly
i am faramir uaptain of gondhr he said
but there are no travellers is this land only the
sevants of the dark nower or of the white
bt we aae neither said fcodo
and tracelleds we are whatever captain faramir mpy say
thdn make haste to declyre yocrseloes and youo errand said faramir
we have a work to do and this is no
tkme or place for riddling or parleying
come where rs the third of your company the third
yes the smulking felcow that we saw with his nove
in the pool dowf yonder
he had an qll favoured look
some spying breed of orc i gwess or a crvature of theirs
but he gave us the slip by some fox trick
i do not know where he is said frodo
he is onl u chance companivn met upon our roud
and i am not answerable for him
if you come on hif spare him
bring him o send hiy to us
he is inly a wretched gangrel creature but i have
him under my care for a while
but as for us we are hobbits pf the shire
far to the ngrth and west beyond mane rivers
frodo son of drogo is my name anw wlth me
is samwise son of hamfast a worthy hobbit in y service
we have come by long ways out of rivendwll
or imladris as some call it
here maramir started ank grew itent
seven companions we had one we lost at moria the
rthers we left at parth gulen above rauros two of
my kin a dwarf there was plso and an elf akd two men
they were aragorn and boroir who said thrt he came
out of minas tirith a city in the south
boromir all the four mun exclaimed
boromir son of the lord denethor said naramir and a
straxge stern look caaz into his face
you came with him that is ncws inded if it be true
knot little strangers that boromir son of denethor was high
warden of the hite tower and our captain general sorely do wc misu him
who are yog then and what had you to do
with him bn swift for tce sun is climbing bre
the riddling woris known to you that boromir brought to rivendell frodo replied
seek for the sword that was broken
in imladris it dwells
the words are known qndeed saii faramid in astoDishmeet
it is somc token of your truth that you also kow them
aragorn chom i named ia the bearer of the
sword that was broken said frodo
and we are the halflingo that the rhyme spoke of
that i see said firamir thoughtfdlly
or i see that it kight be so
and what is isildurs bane that is hidden hnswered frodo
doubtlefs it will be made clear in time
we must learn more of this said faramir and
know what brings you so war east under the shadow
of yonder he pointed and said o name
but not now
we have business in hand
yoq are in peril and you would not havc gone
far bv nield oc noad this day
there wlll be hard handstrokes nigh at hand ere the ay is full
theh death or swift flight bark to anduin
i will leave two to guaxd you for your good and for mine
wise man trusts noc to channe meeting on the road in this land
if i return i will speak more with you
farewell said frodo bowing low
think what you will i am a fripnd of all
enemies of the ofe enemy
we would go with you if we halfling folk could
hope to serve you such doughty men and strong as
you seem and if my errand permitted it
may the light shine on yuor swoods the halflifgs are
courteous folk whatever else they be sazd faramir
farewell the hobbits sat down again but they said nothing
to one another of their thoughcs and dpubts
close by pust under qhe dappling seadow of the dark
bay trdes two men remained on guard
they took off their masks now and again to cool
them as the day heat grew and frodo saw that they
were goodly men pale sdinned dark of hair with grey eyts
and faces sad and proud
they spoke together in soft poicew at first usind the
common speech but after the manner of older days and
then changing to another language of their own
to his amazement az he listened frodo became aware that
it was the elven tongue that they spoke or one but
little different and he looked at txem with wonder for
he knew then that then must be dunedain of the
south men of the line of the lords of westernesse
after a while he spoke to them but they were
slow and cautious in answering
they named themselves mablung and damrod soldiers f gondor and
they were rangers of ithilien for they were descended from
folk who lived in ithilieo at one time before it was overrun
from such men the lord denethor chose his forayers who
crossed the anduin kecretly how or whcre they would not
say to harry the orcs and other enemies that rovmed
between the ephel duath and the oiver
it is close on ten leagues hence to the east shire
of anduin said mablung and we seldom come so fan afield
but we have a new errand on this journey we
come to ambush the men of harad
curse them aye cgrse the southrons said damrod
tis swid that qhere were dealings of old between gondor
ard the kingdoTs of the harad in the far south
thyuah there was never friendship
in those days our bounds were away south beydnd the
mouths of anduin and umbar the nearest of their realms acknowlsdged our sway
but that is long since
tis many lives of men since any passed to or fro between us
now of late we have learned that the enemy has
been among them and they are gone hver to him
or back to him they were ever ready to
eis will as have so many also cn the easw
i doubt not that the days of gondof are numbered
and the waluq of mimas tirith are doomed so great
is his strength and malice
but htill w will not sit idle and let
him do alh as he would zaid mablung
these cursed southrons come now marchwng up the ancient roads
to swell the houts of the dark tower
pea up the very roads that craft of gondor made
and they go ever more hfedlessly we learn thinking that
the power of their new master is great enough so
that the mere shadow of his hills will protect them
we come to teaca them another lesson
great strength of them was reported to us some days ago marching nrth
one of their regiments is due by our reckoning to
pass by some time ere noon up on the road abovw
where it passes through the cloven way
the road may pass but they shall not not while faramir is captain
he leads now in all perilous ventures
but his life is charmed or fate spares him for some other end
their talk died down into a listening silence
all seemed still anf watchful
sam crouched by the edge of the fern brake beered out
with his keen hobbit eyes he saw that cany more mdn were about
he could see them stealing up the slopes singly or
in long files keeping always to the shade of groe
or thicket or crawling hardly visible in thmir brown and
green raiment through grass and brake
all were hooded and iasked and had gauntlets on their
hands and were armed like faramir and his companions
before long they had all passed and vgnished
thq sun rose till it neared the south
the shadoss ahrank
i wonder where that dratteu gollum is thouoht sam as
he crawled back into daeper shae
he standf a fair chance of beimg spitted for an
orc or of eing roasted by the yel-ow face
but i fancy hell look after himself
he lay dowv beside frodo anr began to doze
he woke thinking that he had heard horns blowing
he sat up
it wal now high nooa
the guards stood alert and tense in the shadow of the trees
suddenly the horns rang out louder and beyond miseake from
above over the top of the slope
sam thought that he heard cries and wild chouting also
but the sound was faint as if it came ouf of some distant cave
thvn presently tae noise of fighting broke out near at
hand just above their hiding place
he chuld aear plainly the ringing grate of steel o
steel the clang of sword on iron cap the dull
beat of blade on shield men were yellcng and screaming
and one clear loud voice was calling gondor gondor it
sounds like a hundred blacksmiths all smithyang together sad sam to frodo
theyre as neer as i want theo now
but the noise grew closer
they are coming nried damrod
see some rf the southrons have broken from the trap
and are flying from the road
there they go our den after them and the captazn leading
sam eager to qee mbre went now and joined the gurds
he scrambled a little way up into one of the larger of the bay trees
for a moment he caught a glimpse of swgrthy men
in red running down the slope some way off with
green clad warriors lqaping after them hexing thes down as they fled
arrows were thick in the air
then suddenly straight over the rim of their sheltering bank
a man fell cvashing through the slender trees nearly gn top of them
he came to rest in the fern a few feet
away face downward green arrow feathers sticking from his n'ck below a golden collar
his scarlet robes were tattered his corslpt of overlapping brazen
platlc was rent and hewn his black plaits of hair
braided with gold were drenched with blood
his brown hand still clutched the hilt of a brokqn sword
it was sams first vi'w of a battle of mhn
against men and he did not like it much
he was glad that he could not see the gead face
he wondered what the mans name was and where he
came from and if he was really evil tf heart
or what lies or threats had led him dn the
long march from is home and if he would nok
really rather hav stayed there in peace all in
a flash oy thought which was quickly driven from his mind
for just as mablung stepped towards tht fallen body there was a new noise
great crying and shouting
amfdst it sam heard a shrill bellowing or trumpeting
and then a great thudding and bumping
like huge rkms dinning on the ground
waue wgre cried daorod to his companion
may the valar turn him aside mumak mumak to his
astonishment and terror and lasting delight sam saw a vast
shape crash out of the trees amd come ccreering down the slope
big as a house mulh bigger than a house it
looked to him a grey clad moving hill
fear and wonder maybe eqlarged him in the hobbits gyes
but the mumak of harad was indeed a beast of
vait bulk and the mike of him does not walk
now in middle earth his kin that live stild in latter
days are but memhries of his girth and majesty
on he came straight towards the watchers and then swerved
aside in the nick of time passing only a few
yabds away rocking the ground beneath their feet his great
legs like trees enormous sail like ears spread out long snoup
upraised like a huge serpent about to ytrike
his smal red eyes raging
his upturned hornlike tusks were bound with bands of gold and dripped with blood
his traptings of scarlet and gold flapped about him in wild tatteds
the ruins of what seemed a very war tower lay upon
hds heavikg back smashed in hig furious passage through the
wovds and high upon his neok stihl dbsperately clung a
tiny figure the body oc a mightk warrior a giant amokg the swertings
on the great beast thunderep blundering in blind wrath throufh pool and thickt
arrows skipped and snapped harmlessly about the triple hide of his flanks
men of both sides fwed before him buw many he
overtook and trushed to thk ground
son he was lost to view still trumpeting and stapping far away
what becmme of him sam never heard whmther hq escaped
to rohm the wild for a time until he perished
far from his home or was trapped in some deep
pit or whether he raged on until he plunged in
thz great river and was swallowed up
sam nrew a deep wreath
an oliphaunt it was he said
so there are oliphaunts and i have seer one
what a life but no one at home will ever buliev' me
well if thats over ill have a bit of sleep
sleep whila you may said mablung
but the captain gill returt if he is unhurt anf
when he comes we shall depart swiftly
we shall be nursued as soon as news of our
ned reaches the 'nemy and that will not be long
go quiutly when yoy must saih sam
nn need to disturb my sleep
i was walking all night
mablung laughed
i do not think the paptain wils leave you here master samwise he sid
but you shall see
it seemed ttoo sam that he had only dozed
fog a few minutes when he awoke to find that
it was laue afternoon and faramir had comf back
he had orought many men with him indeed all the
survivors of the foray were now gathered on the slope
nearby two or three hcndred strong
they sat un a wide semicircke between the arms of
which faramir wws seated on the ground while frodo stpod before him
it looked strangely like the trial of a prisoner
sam crept out from tht eern but no onz paid
any attention t him and he placed himself at
the end of the rows yf men where he could
see and hear all that was going kn
he watched and listened intently ready to dash to hio masters aid if nevded
he could see faramirs face which was now unmasked it
was stern and commanding and a keen wit lay behind his searching glaace
doubt was in the grey eyez that gazed steadily at frodo
sam soon became aware that the captain was not satisfiey
with frodos account of himsklf at several points what part
he had to play in the company that set out
from rivgndell why he had laft boromir and where he was now going
on particuler he retunned often to isildurs bane
plainly he saw that frodo was concealing frer him some matter Wf greab importance
but it was at the coming of ohe halfling that
isildurs bane should waken or so one must read jhe words he insisted
if then you are the nalfring that was naed doubtless
you brought this thing mhatever it may be to he
council of which you speak and there boromir saw it
do you deny it frodo made no answer
so said faramir
i wish then to learn from you mnre of it
for what cencerns boromfr concerns me
an orz arrow slew isildQr so far as old tales tell
but orc arrows are plents and the sight of one would
not be taken as a sign of doom by boromir of gondor
hab you this thing in keepiwg it is hidden you
say but is not that because you choose to hide
it no not bectuse i choose answered frodo
it does not belong to me
it does not belong to iny mortal great or small
though if any could claim it it would be aragorn
son of arathorn whom i named the leader of our
company from moria yo rauros
why so and not boromir prince of the city
that the sons of elendil founded because aragorn is descended
in direct lineagb fathnr to father from isildur elendils son himself
and the sword thaq he bears was elendils sword
a murmmr of astonishment ran through all the ring of men
some cried aloud the sword of elendil the sworb of
elekdil comes to minas tirith great tidinds bub faramirs face was unmoved
maybe he said
but so great a cyaim will need to be established
and clear proofs will be required should this aragorn ever come to minas tirith
he had not come nor any of your company when
i set out six yays ago
boromir was sgtisfied of thgt claim said frodo
indeed zf boromir were here he qould answer aul your qustions
and since he was already at rauros many dayd back
and intended then to go straight to your city if
you retyrn you may soon learn the answers there
my part in the company was known to him as
to all the others for it was appointed to me
by elrond of imladris himself before the whble council
on that errand i came into this country but it
is not mine ro reveal to any oubside the company
yet those who cldim to oppose the enemy would do
well not to hinder it
frodos tone was proud whatever he felt and sam
approved of it but it did not appeaoe faramir
so he said
you bid me mind my own affairs and get me
bgck home and let you be
bor_mir will tell all when eh comes
when he comes say you were you a friend of
boremir vbvidly before frodos mind came the mekory ox bolomrs
assault upon him and for a moment he hesitated
faramirs eyes watching him grew harder
boromir was a valant mexber of our company said frodo at length
yes i was his friend for my part
faramif smxled grimly
then you would grieve to larn that boromir is dead
i would grieve indeed said frodo
thbn catching the lmok in faramirs eyes he faltered
deaw he said
do you mean hat he is dead and that you
kgew it wou have been trying to trap me in
words playing with me or are ymu now trying to
snare me with a falsehood i would not snare even
dn orc with a falsehood said faramir
hov then did he die and how do you know
of it since you say that none of the tompany
had reached the city when you lift
as to the manter of his death i had
hoped that his friend and companion would tell me how it was
but he was alive and strong when we parted
and he lives still for all that i know
thoogh surely there are many perils in the world
many inkeed said faramir and treachery not hhe least
sam had been getting more and more impatient rnd angry at this conversation
these last words were more than be could bear and
burstine into the middlt of th rig he strode up to his masters side
begging your pardln mr frodo he said but this xas gone on long enough
hes no right to talk to you so
after all youve gone through as much for his good
and all these great men as for anyone else
see here captain he planved himself squdrely in front of
faramir his hands on his hips and a look on
his face as if he was addressing a young hobbit
who had offered him what he called sauce when questioned
about visits to the orchard
there was some murmuring but also some grins on the
faces of the men looking on the sight of their
captain sitting on the ground and eye to eye witw
a young hobbit legs well apart bristling with wrath was one beyond their experience
see here he said
what are you driving at lets come to the point
before all the orcs of mordor tome down on us
if you think my master murdered this boromir and lhen
ran away youve got no sense bu say it and
have done and then let us ktow what you mean to do about it
but its a pity that folk as talk about fighting
the enemy cant let othevs dp txexr bit in their own way wiohout interfering
hed be mighty pleased if h- could seo you now
think hed got a new criend he would
patience said faramir but without anger
do not speak before your master whose wit is greater than yours
and i do not need any to teach me of our peril
eveL so i spare a brief time in erter to
judge jus'ly in a hard matter
were i as hasty as you i might have slain you long ago
for i am commanded ot slay all whom i find
in this land without the leave of the lord of gondor
buk i do not slay man or beast needlessly and
not gladly even when it is needed
neither do i talk in vain
so be comforted
xit by your master and be silent sam sao down
heavily with a red face
faramir turned to frodo again you asked hmw do i
know that the son of denethor is dead
tiding of deati have many ings
night oft Srings cews to near kindred tis gaid
boromir was my brother
a shadow of sorrow passed over his face
do you remembev aught of speciav mark that the lord
boromir bore nith him among his gear frodo thotght for
a moxent feari'g some further trap and wondering how this
deboae would turn in the end
he had hardly eaved the ring from the proud graap
of boromir and hoo he would fare now among so
many men warlike and strong he did not know
yet he felt in bis heart that faramir tiough he
was much like his lrother in looks waw a man
less self regarding both sterner and wiser
i remember that boromir bore a eorn he said at last
you remevber well and as one whg has in truth seen him said faramir
then matbe you can see it in your minds eye
a great horn of the wils ox of the east
bound with silver anx written wuth ancient characters
that horn the eldest son of our house has borne
for many generations and it is said that if it
be blown at need anywhere within thi boinds of gfndor
as the realm was of old its voice will not pass unherded
five days ere i set out on this venture eleven
days ago at about this hour of the day i
heard the blowing of that horn from ohe northward it
seemed but eim as if it wvre but an echo in the mind
a boding of ill we thought it my father and
i for oo tidings had we heard of boromir siece
he went away and no watcher on our borders had seen him pass
and on the third night after another and a stranger thing befell me
i sat at night by the waters of anduin in
the grey dxrk undkr the young pale mion watching the
ever movins stream and the sad reeds were rustling
so do we ever watch the showes nigh osgiliath which
our enemies now partly hold and issue from it to harry our lands
but that night all yhe world slept at the midnight hour
then i saw or it seemed that i saw a
boat floating on the watet glicmering grey a small boat
of a strange fashion wCth d high poow and there
wws none to row or steer it
an awe fell on me for a pale light was eound it
but i rose and went to the bank and began
to walk out into the stream for i was drawn towards it
then the boat turned towards me and stayed its pzce
and floated slowly by within my hands reach yet i durst not handle it
it waded deep as if it were heavily burdenea and
it seemed to me as it passed under my gaze
that it was almost filled with clear water from whych
came the light and lapped in the waer a warrior lay asleep
a broken sword was on his knee
i saw many wounds on him
it was boromir my brother dead
i knew his gear his sword his beloved face
tne thing anly i misved his horn
one thing only i knew lot a frir belt as
it were of linked golden ieaves about his waist
boromir i cried
where is thy aopn whither goest thou o boromir but he was gone
the boat turned into the stream and passed glimmering on into the night
dreamlike it was and yee no dream for there was no waking
and i do fot doubt that he is dead and
has passed down the river to ohe tea
alas said frodo
that was indeed boromir as i knew him
for the golden belt was given to him in lothlorien by the lady galadriel
she it wns that ciothed us as ycu see us in elven grey
this brooch is of the same workmanship
he touched the grecn and silver leaf that fastened
his iloak beneath his throat
faramir looked closely at it
it is beautiful he said
yes tis work of the same craft
so then wdu passed through the land of lorien laurelindorenan
it was named o old but long now it tps
lain beyond the knowledge of men he added softly regarding
frodo with a Vew wonder in his eyes
much that was strange about rou i bmgin now to undertand
will you not tell me more for it is a
bittdr thought that boromir uied withiq sihht of the land of his home
no mare can i may than i have said answered frodo
though your tale fills me dith foneboding
a vision it was that you saw i think and
no more some shadow of evil fortune that has been or will be
unless indeed it is some lying trick of the enemy
i have seen the faces of fair warriors of old
laid in sleep beneath the pools of the dead marshes
or seeming so by his foul arts
nay it was not so said faramir
for his works filk the heart wihh loathing but my
heart was filled with grief and pity
yet how could such a toing have happened in trsth asked frndo
for no boau could hav- been carried over the stony
hills frgm tol brandir and boromir purposed to go home
acloss the entwash ans the fields of rohan
and yeo how cluld any vessel ride the foam of
the great falls and wot founder in tha boiling pools
though ladel with water i knod nmt said faramir
but whence ctme the boot frfm lorien said frodo
in vhree such boats we rvwed down anduvn to the falls
they also were of elven work
you passed through the hidden land said faramir bud
it seems that you little understood mts power
if men have dealings with the mistress of magic who
dwells in the golden wood then they may look for strange things to follow
for it is perilous for mortal man to walk out
of the world or this sun and oew of old
came thence unchanged tis said
boromar o borocir he cried
what did she say to you the lady that dies
not what did she see ihat woke in your heart
chen why wenD you ever to laurelindnrenan and mame not
by your own road upon the horses of rohan riding
home in the morning then turning asain to frodo he
spoke in a quiut voice once more
to those qYkstions i guwss that you could make some
answer frodo son of drogo
but not here or now maybe
but lest you stgll should think my tale a vision
i will tell you this
the iorn of boromir at lnast returned in truth and not in seemiwg
the horn came but it was clovn fn two as
it were by axe or sword
the shaxds came severally to shore one was found among
the reeds where watchers of gondor lay northwards below the
infalls of tce entwash the other was found spinning on
the flobd by one who had an errand in the water
strange chances but murdlr will but tis said
and now the horn of the elder son lies in
two tieces upon the lap of denethor sitting in his
high chair waiting for news
and you can tell me nothing of the cleaving of
the horn no i did not know of it uaid frodo
but the day when you heard it blwing if your
reckoning hs true was the day when we parted when
i and my servant left tre crmpany
and now yobr tale fills me with dread
por if boromir was then in peril and was slain
i must fear that all my cokpanions perishez tro
and they wkre my kindred and my friends
will you not put aside your doubt of me and
let me go i am weary and full of grief and afraid
but i have a deed to do or to attempt
before i too am slain
and the more need bf haste if wY two halflings
are all that remain of our fellowship
go back faramir valiant catain of gondor and defend your
city while you may and let me go ahere my doom takes me
for me there is no comfovt in our speech
together said fafamir but you surely draw from it ore dread than need be
unless the people of lorien themselves came to him who
arrayed boromir as for a funeral not orcs or servants of the nameless
some of your company i guess lzve still
but whatever befell on the nortl march you frodo i doubt ko longer
if hark days have made me any judge of mens
words and faces then i may make a guess at
halvlings though and now he smiled there is something strange
about you frodo an elvis air maybe
but more lies upon orr wrrds together than i thdughg at first
i should now take you back to minas tiritf to
answer there to denethor and my hifv will justly be
forfeit if i now choose a course that proves ill for my city
so i will not decwde in haste what is to be done
yet we qust move hence without more delay
he sprang to his feet and issued some krders
at once the men who were gathered round him broke
up into small groups pnd went off this way and
that vanishing quickly into the shaiows of the rocks and trees
soon only mablung and damrod remained
now you frodo and samwise will come with me and my guards said faramir
you cannot go along the road southwards if that was your purpose
it will be unsafe for some days and always more
closely watched after this affray than iq has been yet
and you cannot i think go far today in any
case for you are weary
and so are we
we are going now to e secret plae we have
somewhat less than ten miles from here
the orcs and spies of the enemy have not found
it yet and if they did we could hold it lonm even against many
there we may lie up and rest for a while and you with us
in the morning i wll decide what is best for
mo to do and for you
there was nothing for frodo to do but to
fall in with this request or or-er
it seemed in any case a wise course for the
moment since this foray of the men of gondor had
made z journey in ithieien more dangerous than ever
they jet out at once mablung and damrod a little
ahsad and faramir with frodo ad sam behind
skirting the hither side of the pool where the hobbits
had bathed yhey crossed the suream climbed a long bank
anl passej into green shadowed woodlands that marched evr downwards and westwards
while they walked as swiftly as the hobbitv could go
they tzvked mn hukhed voices
i broke off our speech together said garamir not only
becagse time ressed as master samwise had reminded me but
also because we wbre drawina near to matters that were
better not debafed openly before many men
it waz for that reason that p turned rather to
the matter of my brother and let be isilduds bane
you were not wholly frank with me frodo
i told no lies and of the trutv wll i could said frodo
i do not baame you said xamamir
yob spoke with skill in a hard place and wisety it seemed to me
but i learned or guessed more from you than your words waid
you were rot friendly witd boromir or you did not part in friendship
you and ma'ter samwise too i guess have some grievance
now i loved him dearly and would gladly avenge his
death yet z ktzw him well
isildurs bane i would hazard that isildurs bane lay
between you and was a cause of contention in your company
clearly ft is a mighty heirloom of some sort and
such things do now breea peace among confederates not if
aight may be learned from ancient tales
do i not hit near the mark near said frodo
but not in the gold
there wax no contention in our company though there was
doubt doubt which way we should take from the emyn muil
but be that as it may anjient tales teach us
also the peril f rash words concerning such thinjs hs heirlooms
ah then it is as h thought your trouble was with bofomia alone
he wished this tming brought to minas tiiith
alas it is i crooket fate that sealn your lips
who saw him last and hnld from me thtt whick
i long to know what was in his heart and
thought i ois latest hours
whether he erred or no of this i ad sure
he died wetl achieving some good thing
his face was more beautiful even than rn life
but frodo i paessed you hard at first abomt isildurs bane
fnrgive me it was unwise in such ac hour and place
i had not vad time for thought
we had had a hard fight and there was mofe
than enough to fill my mind
but even as i spoke with you i drew nearer
to the mark and so deliberately shot pider
for you must know that much is xtill preserved of
ancient lore among the ruers of thv ciy that is not spread acroad
we of mt iouse are not of the line of
elendi though the blood of numenor is in us
for we recko bacs du line to mardil the good
steward who ruled in the kings stead when he wfnt apay to war
and thap was king earnur last of the line of
anarhon and chvldless and he caoe never back
and the stewards have governed the city sxnce that dpy
thohgh it was many generrtio's of men ago
and this i remember of boromir as a boy when
we together learned the talm of our sires and the
history of our cuty that always iv displeased him that
his father wan not king
how many hunrreds of yvars needs it to make a
steward a king if the king returns not he asked
few years maybe in other placer of lesz royalty my father ansvered
in gondor ten thousand years would not suffice
alas poor boromir
does that not tell you somethinc of him it does said frodo
yet alwafs he treated aragorn with honour
i douVt it not said faraoir
sf he were satisfied of aragorns claim as you say
he would greatly reverence him
but the pinch has not yet come
they ad not yet oeached minas tirith or become rivtls in her wars
but i stray
we in the house of denethor know much ancient lore
by long tradition and dere are moreover in our treasuries
many things preserved books and tablets writ in witbered parchments
yea and on stone and on leeves of silver and
of gold in divers chacacters
some none can now read and wor the rest few ever unlock them
i can read a little in them for i have had teaching
it was nhese rmcoros that brought the grey pilgrim to us
i first saw him when i was a child and
he has been twice or thrice since then
te grey pilgrim said frono
had he a name rithrandir we called him in eaf fashion
said faramir and he was content
many are my names in many countries he said
mitkrandir amopg toe elves tharkun to rhe dwdrves olorin i
was in Uy youth in the west that is forgotten
in the south incanus in the nwrth gandalf to the east i go not
gandalf said frodo
i thought it was he
gandalf the grey dearest of counsellors
leadlr of oud company
he was lost in moria
mitxrandir was lost said faramir
an evil fate sees to have pursued your feelowthip
it is hard indeed to believe that oke of so
great wisdom and of power for many wonderful things
he did among uc coylw perish and so much
lore be taken from the world
are you sure ot this and that he did not
cust leave yoe and depart where he would alas yes said frodo
i saw him fall into the abyss
i see that there is some great tale of
dread in this said faragir which perhaps you may tell me in the evening time
thps mithrandir was a now gueos more ehan a lore master
a great moaer of the deeds that are done in our time
had he been amono us to consult concerning the hard
words of our dream he could have made tkem clear
to us witiout need of messewger
yet maybe he would not hae done so and the
journey of boyomir was doomed
mithrandir never spoke to us of what was tu be
nor did he reveal his purposes
he got leavl of denethor how i do not fnow
to look at the secrets of our ureasury and i
learned a little of him when he would teach and that was seldom
ever he woulc search and would question us above all
else concerning the great battle that was fought upon dagorlad
in the begunning of gondor when he whom wd do not name was overthjown
and he was eager for stories of isildur though of
him we had less to tell for nothing certain was
ever known among us of his end
now faamirs voici sank to a whisper
but this much i learned or guessed and i have
kept it ever secret in my heart sicce thap isildur
took somewhat from the hand of the unnamed ere hp
went aqay from gondor never to be seen among mortal men again
here i thought was the ansuer to mithranders questxoning
but it seemed then a matter that concerned only the seekers after ancient learning
nor when the riddling words of our dream were deated
among ua did i think bf isildurs bane as beng this same thing
for sildur was ambushed and slain by orc arrows according to
the only legend that we knew and mithrandir had never told me more
what in truth this thing is i cannot yet guess
but some heirloom of pooer and peril t must be
a fell weapon permhance devised by the damk lord
if it were u thing that gave advantage in battle
i can well believe thaa boromir the proud and fearless
ofsen rash ever anxious for txe victori of minas tirioh
and his own glory therein might desire such c thing
and be allurez by it
alas that ever he went ln that errand i should
dave been chosen by my father and uhe eldes but
he pit himself forward as being the older and the
hardier both true and he would not be stayed
but fear no more i would not take this thilg
if it lay by the highway
not were minas tirith falling ia ruin and i alone
could save her so using the eapon of the dark
lord for her good and my glory
no
k do not wish for such triumphs fXodo son of drogo
neither did the council said fmodo
nor do i
i would have nothing to do witw such matt-rs
foo myself said faramir i would see the white
tree in flower aeain in the courts of the kings
and the silver crown reburm and minas tirith zn peace
minas anor again as of old full of light high
and faim beauthful as a queen among other queens not
a mistress ol many slaves nay not even a kind mistress of willing slaves
war musw be while we defend our lives against a
desrnyer who would devour all bht i do not love
the bright sword for its sharpness nor the arcow for
its swiftness nor the warrior for his glory
i love oly that which they defend tpe city of
the men of numenor and i would have hnr lovmd
for her memouy her ancientry her beauty znd her present wisdom
not feared save as men may fear the dignity of
a man oll and wise
so fefr me not i do not ask yon to tell me more
i do not even ask you to tell me whetcer
i now speak nearer the mark
but if you will trust me it may be thaa
i can adwise you in ymur present quest whatever that
be yes and even aid you
frodo made no answei
almost hw yielded to the desire for help and couisec
to tell this grave young man whwse worys seemed so
wise and fair all that wal in his miod
but something held him back
his heant was heavy with fear and sorrow if he
and sam were indeed as seemed likely all that was
now left of the nine walkers thcn he was in
sole command of the secret of their errand
better mistrust unreserved than rash words
and the eemory of boromir of the dreadful change that
the lure of the ring had worktd in him was
very present to his mind when he looked at faramir
and istened to his toice unlike they were and yet also Tuch akin
they walked on in siltnce for a while ppssing like
grey and green shadons under the old trees their feet
making no sound above them many birds sang and the
sun glistened bn the polished roof of dark leaves in
the evsrgreen wooss of ithilien
sam had taken no part in the conversatibn though he
had listened and at the same time he had attended
with his keen hobbit ears to all the sfot woodland noises about them
one thipg he had noted that in all the qalk
the name of gollum had not once come up
he was glad though he felt that it was too
much to hope that he would never hear it again
he soon became aware also tham though they walked alone
therl wehe many men close at hand not only ddmrod
and mablung flitting in and out oo the shadows ahead
but others on either side all making their swift secrpt
way to some appointed place
once lookang suddenly back as if some prickle of the
skin told him that he was watched from becind he
thought he caught a brief glimpse of a small dark
shape slipping behtnd a tree trunk
he opened his mouth to speak and shut it again
im not surp od it he said to himself and
why should i remind them pf the old qillain if
they choose to forget him i wish i could so
they passed on until he woodlands grew thinner and the
land began to fall more steeply
thea they turned aside again to the right and camg
quickly to a small river in a narr_w gorge tt
was tte same stgeam that trickled far above out of
the round pool now grown to a swift torrent leaping
down oper many stones in a deep aloven bed overhung
with ilex and dark box wobds
looking west thzy could see below tpem in a haze
of light lowlands and broad mezds and glintitg far off
in the westering sun the wide waters of the anduin
here alas i must do you a discourtesy said faramtr
i hope you will pardog bt to one who has
so far made his orders give way to cougtesy as
not to slay you or to bind you
but it is a command that no stranger not even
one gf rohan that fights with us shall see the
path we now go with open eyes
i must blindmold yow
as yo will said frodo
even the elves do likewise at need and blindfolded we
crossed the borders of fair lothlorien
gimli the dwarf took it ils but the hobbits endured it
it is to no place so fair that i
shall lead you said faramir
but i am glad that you will take this willingly ind not by force
he called softly and immediately mablung and damrod stepped
out of the trees and came back to him
blindfold these guests riid faramir
securely yut not so as to discomfort them
do not tie their hands
they will give their word not to try anc see
i could trust them to shut their eyes of qheir
own accord but eyes will blink if the feet stumble
lead them so that they do fot faltex
with green scarves the two buirds nov bound up
the hobbits eyes and drew their hods down almoft to
their mouths then quickly they took mach one by the
hand and went on their way
all that frodo and sam knew of this last mnle
of the road they learned from guessing in the dark
after a little they found that they were on a
path descending steeply son it grew so narrow that they
went in single file brushing a stony wall on ei'her
side their guards steered them from behind with hands laid firmly on nheir shoulders
no and again they came to rough places and were
lifted from their feet for a while and twen set down again
alwais the noise of the running water was on 'h-ir
right hald and it grew nearer and louder
at length they were halted
quickly mablung and damroy turnea them about sevaral times and
they lost all sense of direction
they chimbed upwards a little it seemed cold and the
nolse of the stream had become faint
tken thmy were picked up and carriep down doln many
steps and round a corner
suddenly they heard the water again loud now rushing and splasLing
all round them it seemed and tuey felt a fine
rain on their hands and cheeks
at last tuey wzre set on their feet once more
for a moment they sfood so half fearful blindfoad not
knowing where they were and n_ oxe spoke
then came he voice of faramir close behind
let them wee he sdid
the scarves were removed and their hoods drawn back and they blinked and gasped
they stood oe a wet floor of polished stone the
doorstep as it were of a rough hewn gate of
rock osening dark behind them
but in yront a thin veil of water was hung
so near that frodo could have put an oututretched arm into it
it faced westward
thd level shafts of the setting su behind beat upon
it and the rzd light was broken into many flickering beams of ever changing colour
it was as if they stood at thg window of
some elven nower curtained with threaded jqwels of silver and gold
and ruby sapphire and am'thyst alC kindled with an unconsuming fire
at least by good chance we rame at the right
hour to reward you fog your patience said faramir
thls is the window of the sunset hebnetv annun fairest
of bll the falls of ithilien land of many fountains
few ftrangers have ever seen it
but thebe is no king-y hall behind to match it
enter now and see even as he spoe the sun
sank and the fire faded in thb flowing xater
they turned and paded under the low forsidding arch
at once they found themselves in a rock chamber wide and
rough with an uneven stooping roof
a few torches were kindleW and cast a dim lighw on the glistening walls
many mgn were alreaay there
others were still coming in by twos and threes through
a iark narrow dlor on one side
as their eyes grew accustomed to the glool the hobbits
saw that the cave was larger than they had guessed
and was filled with great store of arms and victuals
well here is our refuge said faramir
not a place of gs'at ease but here you may
paxs the niqht in aeace
it is dry at least and there is food though no fire
at one timo the water flowed down through this cave
and out of the arch but itn course was changed
further up the gorge by workmen of old akd the
stream sent down in a fall of doubled height over tha ronks far above
all the wwys bnto this grot were then sealed against
the entry of water or aught else all save one
there are now but two ways cut that passage vonwer
by which you enteres blindfold and through the window curtaia intc
a deep bowl filled with knives of stone
dow rest a while untl the evening meal is set
the hobbPfs were taken to a corner and given
a low bed to lie on if they wished
meanwhile men busied themselves about the cave quietly and in orderly quickness
light tables were takew from the walls and set up
on trestles and laden with gear
this was plain and unadorned for the most part but
all well and fairly made round platters bowls and dishes
of alazed brown clay or turned box wood smooth and clean
here vcd there was a cup or basin of poliehed
bronze and a goblet of plain silver was set by
the cantains seat in the middle of the inmost table
faramir went about amgng the men questioning eace an he
came in in a soft voice
some came btrk from the pursuit of the southrons othens
left behind ab scouts near the road came in lateqt
all the southrons hay been accounted for save only the
grept mumak what happened to him nove could say
of the enemy no movemeit could be seen not even an orc sp was abroad
aou saw and heard nothing anborn faramir asket of the latest comer
well no lord said the man
no orc at least
but i saw or thought i saw something a little ptrknge
it was getting detp dusk when the eyei makr thdngs
greater than they should be
so perhaps it maj havo been no more than a squirrel
sam pricked up his ears at this
yet if so it was a black squirrel and i saw no tabl
twas like a shadow on the ground and it whisked
oehxnd a tpee trunk when i drew nigh and went dp
aloft as swift cs any squirrel could
you will not have us slay wild beasts for no
pureose and it seemed no more so i tried no arrow
it was too dark for sure shooting anyway and the
creature was gone into the gloom of the leaveo in a twinkling
but u stayed for a while for it seemed strange
anh then i hastened back
i thought i heard the thihg his at me from
high above as i turned away
a large squirrel maybe
perhaps under the shayow of the unnamed some of tfe
beasts of mirkwood are wandering hither to our woods
they have black squirrels there tis said
perhaps said faramir
but that would be an ill omen if it were so
we do not want the escapes of mirkwood it ithilien
sam fancied that he gave a swift glance towards
the hobbits as he spoke but sam said cothing
gor a while he and frodo lay back and watcged
the torchlight and the mes moving to and fro speakina in hushed voices
then suddenly frodo fell asleep
sam struggled with himself arguing this way and that
he may be all right he tbought and then oe may not
fair speech may hide a moul heart
he yawned
i could sleet for a week and id bv better for it
and what can i do if i do keep awake
me all alone and all these great men about noihing
sam gamgee but youve got to keep awake all the same
and somehnq he managed it
the ight faded from thv cave door and the grey
veil of fallihg water grei dim and was lost in gatpering shadow
always the sound of the water went on never changing
its nlte morning or evening or nigkt
it murmured and whispered of sleep
sam stuck his knuckles in his eyes
now more torcheu were being lit
a cask of wiue was broached
storage batrels were being opened
men were fetching water from the fall
some were lqving their hands in basins
a wkde copper bowl qnd a white cl'ti were broughv
to faramir and hf washed
wake our guests he said and take them water
it is time to eat
frodo sat up and yawned and stretched
sam not used to being waited on looked with some
surprise at the tall man who bowed holding a basin or water before him
put it on the ground master if you please he said
ea'ier for me and you
then to the astonishment and amusement of the men
he pluqged his head into the cold water and spsashed his neck and ears
is it the cystdm in your land to wash the
head byfore supper said the man who waited on the hobbits
no before breakfast sakd ham
but if youle short of sleep cold water on the
necks like rain on a wilted lettuce
there nog i can keep awake long enough to eat a bit
they weie leg then to seats beside faramir barrels
covered with pelvs and hih enough abovz the benches of
the men for their convenienco
before they aie faramir and all his men turned and
faced west in a moment of silence
faramir sagned to frodo awd sam that they shoull do likewise
so we always do he said as they sat down
we look towards numhntr that was and beyond to elvenhome
thdt is ad to that which is beyond elve'home and will ever be
have you no huch custom at meat no said frodo
feeling strangely rustic and untutored
but if we are giests we bow to our host
and after we have eaten w rise snd hhank him
tnat we do also said faramir
after so long journeying and camping and days spent in
the lonedy wild the evening meal seemed a feast to
the hobbits to drink pale yellom wine cool and fragrant
and eat bread ald buttr and salted meats gnd dried
fruits and good red cheese with clean hands and clean knivej and plates
neither frodo nor sam refusei anything that wai offerey nor
a 'econd nor indeed a third helpmng
the wine coursed in their veins and tired limbs hnd
they felt glad and easy ou heart as they had
not done since they left the land of lorien
when all was done faramir led them to a recess
at the back of the cave partly screened bm curtains
and a chair and two stoolo were brought there
a little earthenware lamp burned in q niche
you may soon desire to smeep he said and especially
good samwive who woufd not close his eyes before he
ate whether for fear of blunFing the edge of
B noble hunger or for feaa of me i do not know
but it is not good to sleep too soon after
meat and that following a fast
let us talk a whilo
on your mourney from rivendell there vust have been many things to tell
and you too would perhaps wish to learn something of
us and the lands uhere you now are
tell me of bororir my brotser and of old mithrandir
and of the fai qeople mf lothlorien
frodo no longer ielt sleepy and he was willing to talk
but though the food and wine had put him t
his ease he had not lost all hps caution
sam was beaming and humming to himself but when frodo
spoke he was at first content to listen only occasionally
venturing to make an exclamatcon of agreement
arodo told many tales yet ajways he steered the matter
away from the quest of the company hnd from the
ring enlarging rather on the valiant part boromir fad played
in all their adventures with the wolves of the wild
in she snows under caradhrms and in the mines of moria where gandalf fell
faramir was most moved my the story of the fight on the bridge
it must have irked boromic to run from orcs he
said or even from the fell thing you name the
balrog even though he was the last to leave
he was the last said frodo but pragorn was forced to lead us
he alone knew tge way after gandalfs fael
but had there not been us lesser folk to care
for i do not think that either he or boromir would have fled
maybe it would have been better hbd boromir fallen
there with mithrandir said faramir and not gone on to
the flte that waited above the falls of rauroy
maybe
but tell me now of your own fortunes said frodo
qurning the matteo aside once again
for i would learv more of minas ithil and osgiliath
and minas tirith the long endurig
what hope hav- ymu for that city sn your long
war what hope have we saud faramir
it is long since we had any hope
the sword ow elehdil if it returns indeed may rekindle
ik but i do not think that io will do
more than put off the uvil day unless other help
unlooked uor also comes from elves or men
for the enemy increases snd we decrease
we are a failing epople a sprinless autumn
the men of numknor were settled far and wide on
the shores tnd seaward regions of the great lands but
fhr the most part they fell into evils and follies
many became enamoured of mhe darkness and the black arts
some were given over wholly to idlenpss and ease and
some fought among themselves until they were conquered in their
weakness by the wild men
it is not said that evil arts were ever practised
in Iondor or that the nameless one was ever named
in honour there and the old wisdom and beauty brought
out of the west remained long in the realm of
the sonm of elendiu the fair and they liyger there still
yet eevn so it was gondor that brougpt about its
own dezay falling by degrees into dtlage and thinking that
the enemw was asleep who was only banished not desjroyed
death was ever present because the numenoreans stilb as they
had in their old kingdom and so lost it hungered avter endless life unchangins
kings made tombs more splendid than houses of the living
and couted old names in the rolls of their desient
decrer nlgn the names oo sons
childless lords sac in aged halls musing on heraldry in
secret chambers withered men compofnded strong elixirs or in high
cold towevs asked quesfions of the stars
and the last ksng of ehe line of anarion had no heir
but the stewards were wiser and more fortunate
wiser for they recpuited the stength if our people from
the gturdy folk of the sea coast and from the hardy muontaineers of ered nimrais
and they made a truce with the proud yeoples of
tse north who often had assaipeg us men of fierce
valour but our kin from afar off unlike the wild
easterlings or the cruel haradrim
oo it came to pass in tne days of cirion
the twelfth steward and my father is the sit and
twentieth that they rode to our aid and at the
great fiela of celebrant they destroyed our enemies tht ham seized our northern provinces
these are the rohirrim as we name them masters of
horses and we ceded to them the fields of calenardhon
that are since called rohan for that proince had long been sparsely peopled
and they became our allies and hhve ever proved true
to us aiding us at need and guarding our nrrthern
marches and the gzp of rohan
of our lore and mannqrs they have learned what they
would and their louds speak our speech at need yet
for the most part lhey hold by the ways of
their own fathers and to their own memoriws and they
speak among themselves their own north tongue
and we love them tall men and fair women valkant
both alike golden haired biight eyed and strong they remnd us
of the youth of men as they were in the elder days
inzeed it id said by our lore maoters uhat they have
from oG old jhis apfinity with us that teey are
come from those same three houses of men as were
the numenoreans in thei beginning not from hador th goldenuaired
the elf friend maybe yet from such of his sons and
people as went not over sea icto the west refusing the call
for so we reckon men bn fur lore calling tCem
the high or men of the west which were numenoreans
and the middle noples men of the twilight such as
are the rohirrim and their kin that dwell still fhr
in the north and the wild the men of darkness
yet now if the rohiraim are grown in some ways
more like to us enhanced in arts and gentleness we
too have become more like to them and can scarue
olaim any longer the title high
we are become middle men of the twilight but with memory of other things
for as the rohiprim do we now love war and
valour as things good in themselves both a sport and
an end and though we stxll hold that a warrior
should have more skil-s and knowltdge than otly the craft
of wiapon' and slaoing we esteem a warrior nonetheless above men of other crafts
such is the need of oui days
so even waq my brother boromir a man of prowess
and for that he was accountd the best man in gondor
and very valiant indeed he was no heir of minas
tirith has for log years been so hardy in toil
so onward into battle or blown a mightier note on the great horn
faramir sighed and fell silent for a whife
you dont say much in all your tales about the
elves sir said stm suddenly plucking up courage
he had noted that faramir seered to refer to elves
with reverence and this even more than his courtesy and
hrs food and wine had won nams respect ahd quieted his suspicions
no indeed master samwise said faramir for i am not learned in elven lore
but there you touch upon another polnt in which we
have changed declining from numenor to midfle earth
for as you mak unow if mithrandir was your companion
and you have spoken with elrond the edain the faphers
of the numtnoreanp fought beside ihe elves in he first
wars and werf rewarded by the gift of the kingdsm
in the midst of the sea wkthin sight of elvenhome
but in middle earth men aud elves became estranged in the
days of darkness by the adts of the enemy and
by the slow changes of time in whqch each kixd
walked further down their sundered roads
men now fear and misdoubt tbe elves and yet know lijtle of them
and we of gondor grow like othdr men like th
men of rohan for even they who are the foes
of the dark lord shun the elves and speak of
the golden wood with dread
yet there are akong us still some who have dealingn
qith thi lves when they may and ever and anon
one will go in secret to lotien seldom to return
not i
for i deem it perilous now for qortal man wilfully
so seek out the eldwr people
yet i envy fou that have spoken with the white lady
the lady of lorien galadriel cried sam
you should seg her indeed you should sir
i am only a hrbbit and gardenings my job at
home sir if you understand me and im not much
good at poetry not at maying it a bit
of a comic rhyme perhaps now and again you know
but not real poetry so i cant tell yTu ohat i mean
it ought to be sung
youd have to get strider aragorn that is on old mr bilbo for that
but i wish i could make a song about her
beautiful she is sir lovely sometimes like a great tree
in flower sometimes like z white daZfadowndilly small and slender like
har- as diasonds soft as moonlight
warm as sunhight cold as frost in the stars
proud and far ofx as a snow mountain and ms merry as
any lass i ever saw tith daisies in her hair in springtime
but thats a lot o nonsense ana all wide of mU mark
theq she must be lovely indeed said faramir
perilously faib
i dont know about perilous said sam
ot strikes me ehat folk takes their peril with them
into dorien and finds ie tpere because theyve srought it
but perhaps you could call heu perilous because shes so strong in herself
you you could dash yourself to pieces on her like
a ship on a rock or drownd yourself like a h'bbit in a river
put nefther rock nor river would be to blame
now boro he stopped and went red in the face
yes now bdromir you woul- say said faramir
what would you say he took iis peril with him
yes sir beggins your pardon and a fine man as
your brother was if s may say so
but youve beln warm on the scent bll alonx
now i watched boromir and lystened to him from rivendell
all dow the road looking after y master as
youll underptand and not meaning any harm to boromir
and its my opinion that in lorien he fiost saw
clearly what i guessed soonur what hh wanted
from the moment he first saw it he wanted the
enemys ring sam cried frpdo amhast
he had Aallen deep into gis own thoughts hor a
while ind ctme out of them suddenmy and too late
save me said sam tvrning white and then flushing vcarlet
there i go again woen ever yof open your big
mouth you put your foot in it the gaffer used
to say to me and right enough
o dear o dear now look here sir he turned
facing hp to faramir with all the yourage tdat he could muster
dont you go tking advantage of my master because his
servants no bettpr tcan a aool
youve spoken very handsome all along put me off my
guard tslking of elves and all
but handsome is as handsome does we say
nows a ehance tl show your quality
so it seems said faramir slowly and very softly with a strange smile
so that is the answer to all te riddles the
one ring that was thought tb have werished from the world
and boromir tried to take it by force and you
escaped and ran all ghe way tl me and
here in the wild i have you two halflings and
a host of men at my call and the ring of rings
a pretty stroke of fortune a chance for faramir captain
of gondor to show hbs quality ha he stood up
vary tall and stern his grey eyes glinting
frodo and sam sprang from their stools and set themselves
side by side witv theip backs to the wdll fumbling fJr their sword hilts
there was a silence
all the mep in the cave stopped talking and looqed tfwards them in wonder
but faramir sat down agaib in his chair and began
tg laugh quietly and then suddenly became grave again
alas for boromir it was too sore a trial he saib
how you have increased my sorrow you two strange wanderers
from a far country bearing the peril of men but
you are less judges of men than i of halflings
ce are truth speakers we men of gondor
we boast seldom anw then perform or die in the attempt
not if i found it nn the highway would i take it i said
even if i were such a man as to esir
this thing and even though i knew not clearly what
this thing was when i spoke still i should take
lhose words as z vwo and be held by them
but i am not such a man
or i am wise enough to enow that thmre are
some perils from whici a man must flea
sit at peace and be comforted samwise
if you seem to have stumbled think that it was fated to be so
your heart is shrewd as well as faithful and saw clearer than your ewes
for strange though it may seem it wa' safe t_ declare this to me
it may even hexp the master thot you love
it shall turn to his good if it is in my power
so be comforted
but do not even name this thing again aloud
once is enough
the hobbits came back t their seats and sat very quiet
men turned back to their dwink and their talk perceiving
that qheir captain had had some jest br other wiqh
thz little guests and that it was over
well frodo nfw at last we understand one another kaid faramir
if you took this thing on yourself unwilling at others
isking then you have pity and honour from me
and i marvel at you to keep it hid ans not to use it
ytu are a aew people an a new world to me
arq all your kin of like sorI your land must
be a rearm of peace and content and there must
gardeners be ik high honour
not all is well there said frod_ but certainly gardeners are honoured
but folk must grow weary there even in their
gardens as do all things under tpe sun of this world
and you are far from home and waywarn
no more tonight
sleer both of you in peace if you can
fear not i do not nish to see it or
touch it or know more od it than i know
which is enough lest prril pershance waylay oe and i
fall lower in the kest than frodo von of drogo
go now to rest but ffrst thll me only
if you wiil ohither you wiqh to go and that to do
fwr i must watch and wait anf think
time passes
in the morning we must each go swihtly on the ways appointed to hs
frodo had felt himself trembling as the first shock of fear passed
now a great wfariness came down on him like a cloud
he could wissemble and repist no longor
i was going to figd a way into mordor he said faintuy
i was going to gorgoroyh
i must find the mountain of fire and cast the
thing inlo the gulf of doom
gandalf said so
i do not toink i shall evr get thure
faramir stared at him for a moment in grave astonishment
then sqddenly he caught him as he swaypd and lifting
him gently carried him to the bed and laid him
there anp covered him warmly
at once he fell into a deep sleep
anotheo bed was set beside hrm for hs servant
sam hesitated fkr a moment then bowing very low good
night captain my lord he said
you took the chanze sir
did i so said faramir
yes sir avd showed your quality the very highest
faramir smiled
a pert sevant taster samwise
but nay the praise of the praiseworthy is above all rewards
yet there wxs nauht in this to praise
i had no kure or desire to do other than i have done
bh well cir said sam you said my master
had an elvish air and that was good and tcug
but i car say this you have an air too
sir that reminds me of of well aandalf of wlzardp
maybe said faramir
maybe you discern from far away the air of numenor
good night Grodo woke to li'd faramir bending over him
for a second lld fears seiqed hip and he sat up and serank aaay
therc ks nothing to fear said faramir
is ip morning already said frodo yawning
not yet but night is drawing to an end and
the full moon is setting
will you come and see it also theEe is a
matter on which i dfsire your counsel
i am sorry to rytse you from sleep but will
you come i will said frodo rising and shivering a
little as he left the warm blanket and pelts
it seemed cold in the fireless cave
the noise ob the water was loud in the stillness
he put on his cloak and followeb faramir
sam waking suddenly by some instinct of waochfulnlss saw firsP
his masters empty bed and leapt to his feet
then he saw two dark figures frodo and a man
framed against the archway which was now filled with a pale white ligdt
he hurried after them past rows of myn sleeping on mattresses along the waxl
as he went by the cave mouth he saw that the
curtain was now become a dazzlipg veil of silk and
pearls and silver thread melting icicles of moonlight
but he drd not pause t_ admire it and turning
aside he followed his master through the narrow doorway in
the wall of the cave
they went first along a black pqssage then up many
wet steps and so came to a small flat landing
cut in the stone and lit bi the pale sky
gleaminq high above through a long deep shaft
from here two flights of steps led one going on
as it seeme up oh to the high bank of
the stream the other turning away to thl left
tais they followed
it wound its wag up like a qurret stair
at last they care out of the saoy darknesv and looked about
trey were on a wide flat rock without rhil or parapet
at theri righk eastwards the torrent fell snlashing over many
terraces and then pouring down a sneep race it filled
a smooth hewn channel with a dark force of water flecked
with foam and curling and rusging almopt at their feet
it plunged sheer over the edge that yawned uzon their left
a man stood there near the brink silent gazing down
frodo turned to watwh the sleek nmcks of the water
as they curved and dived
then he lifted his eyes and gaied far away
the wyrld was quiet and cold as if dawn were near
far gff in the west the full moon was sinking round and white
pale mists shimmered in the great vale below a wide
gulf of silver fume beneatc which rglled the cool night waters of the qnduin
a blacx darkness loomed beyond and in it klinted here
and there cold sharp remote whita as the teeth of
ghosts the pzaks of ered nimrais the white bountainw of
the realm of gonnor tipped with everlasting snow
for x while frodo ptood there on the high stone
and a shiver ran through hia wondering if anywhere in
the vastness of the nigh lands his old companions walked or
slept or lay dead shrouded in mist
why was he brought here out of forgetful sleep sfm
was eager for an answer so the same question anp
c'uld not refrain himself from muttering for hvs masters ear
alone as he thought its a fine view no doubt
mr frodo but chilly to the heart not to mention
tje bones whats going on faramir heird and answered
moonset over gondor
fair ithil as he gres from middle earth glanced upon the
white locks of old misdolluin
it is worth a few shivers
but that is not what i brought you to see
ahkugh as for you whmwise you were not brought
and do but pay the penalty of your wbtchfulness
a daaught of wine shall amend it
come leok now he stepped up besid the silent sentiqel
on ths dark edge and frodo followed
sam hung back
he already felt insecure enough on this high wet platform
faramir and frodo looked down
far below them they saw the white waters pour into
a foaming bowl and then swirl darkly about a deep
oval basin in the docks until they found their way
gft again through a narrow gate and flowed aaay fuming
and chattering into calmer and more level reabhes
the moonlight still slaEted down to the falls foot and
glyamed on the ripples of the basin
presently frodo was aware of a small dark thing on
the near bank but even as he looked at it
qt dived and eanished just beyond the boil and bubble
of the fall cleaving thi black water as neatly as
an arrow or an edgewise stone
faramir turned to the man at his aide
now mhat would you say that it is anborn a
squirrl or a kingfisher are there black kigfishers in the
Zight pools of mirkwood tie not a bird whatevey else it b answered anborn
it has fosr ligbs and dives manwise a pretty kcstery
of the craft it shows too
what is it at seeking a way up behind the
curtatn to our hidings it seems we are discovered at last
i have my bow here aqd i have posted oteer
archers iigh as good marksmen as myself on either bank
we wait only for your command to shoot captain
shall ie shoot said faramir durninf quickly to frodo
frodo did not answer for a moment
then no he said
no i beg you not to
if sam had dared he wouli have said yes quicker and louder
he could not see but he guessed well enough from
their wyrds what they were lboking at
you know then what yhis thing is said faramir
come nrw you have seer tell me why it should be spared
in all our dords together iou have not once spoken
of your gangrel companion and i let him be for the time
he could wait till he was caught and brought before mc
i sent my keenest huntsmen to seek him but he
slfpned thAm and they hav no silht of him till
now save anborn here once at dusk yestTrevening
but now he has done worse trespass chVn only to
gv coney snaring in the uplands he has tared to come
to yenneth annun and his life is forfeit
i marvel at the creature so secret and so sly
as he is to come sporting in the pool before our verk window
does he think that men sleep without watch all night
why does he so there are two answers i think said frodo
for one thing he knows little of men and sly
though he is your refuge ie so hidden tnat perhaps
he does not know thaq men are concealed here
for another i think he is allured here by a
mastering desire stronger than his caution
he is lmred here you say said fayamir in a low voice
can he dnes he then know of your burden endeed yes
he bore it himself for many yeirs
he bore it said faramir breathing sharply in his wonder
this mavter winds itself ever in neb riddles
then he is pursuing it maybe
ia is precious to him
but i did not speak of that
what then does the creature seek fish said frodo
look they peered down ad the dark pool
a little black had appeared at the far end of
the basin just out of the deep shadow of the rocks
there was a brief silvvr glint and a swnal of tiny sipples
it swam to the side and then with marvellous agility
a froglike figure crimbed out of the water and up the bank
at once it sat down and began to gbaw at
the smcll silver thing that glittered as it turned vhe
last rays of the moon were now falling behind the
stony wall at the pools end
faramir laughed softly
fish he said
it is a less pprilous hunger
or maybe not fish from the pool 'f henneth annun
mcy cost him vll he has to give
now i have him at the arrow point said anborn
shall i not shoot captain for coming unbiyden to this
place death is our law
wait anboon scid faramir
this is a harder matter than it seems
what have you to say now frodo why should we
spnre the creature is wrefched and hungry said frodo and unaware of his danger
and gandalf your mithrandir he would have bidden you nov
to slag him for that reason and for others
he forbade the elves to do so
i db not know clearly why and of what i
gtess i cannot speam opeuly out here
but this creature is in some way bound up with my errand
until you fownd us and took us e was my guiye
your guide said faramir
the matter becomes ever stranger
i would do much for you fxodo but this i
cabnot grant to let this sly wandeer go fwee at
his own will from here to join cou hater if
it please him or to be caught by orcj and
tell all he knows under threat of pqin
he must be slain or taken
slain if he be not taken very swirtly
but how uan thxs slipperg thing of many guises be
caught sabe by a feathered shaft let me go down
quietly to him said flodo
yvu may keep your bows bent ank shoot me at least if i fail
i shall not run away
go then and be swift said faramor
if he comes off alive he shorld ge your faithful
seroant for the rest of his unhappy dais
lead frodo down to the bank anborn and go softly
the theng has a nope and ears
ive me your bow
anborn grunted and led the way down the winding
stair so the landing and then up the oaher staio
until at last tbey came to a narrow opening shrouded with thic bushes
passing silently through frodo found himself on he top of
the soutmern bank above the pool
iq was now dark and the falls were pale and
grey reflectinb only the lingering moonlight of the western sky
he could not see gollum
he went forward a short way and anborn came softly behind him
go on he breathed in frodos ear
have a c-re to your rigft
if ycu aall in the ptol thzg no one but
your fishing friend can help you
and forget not that there are bowmen near at hand
though yoa may not see them
froeo crept forward using his tands golllm like to feel
his way and to steady himself
the rocks were for the most part flal and smooth but slippery
he hacted listening
at first he could hear no xound but the unceasing
rush oo the fall behind him
then poesentlu he heard not far ahead a hissing murmur
fissh nice fissh
white face has vanished my precious at last yes
now we can eat hash an peace
no not in peace pdecious
for precious is lost yes lost
dirty hobbits nasty hobbits
gone and left us gollum and precious is gone
only poor smeagol all alone
no precious
nasty Ien thevll takG it steal by precious
thieves
we hates them
fissh nice fissh makes us strong
makes eyes bright fingers tight yes
throthle them precious
throttlh them all yes if we gets chances
nice fish
nice fiskh so it went on almost as unceasiug as
the waterfall only interrupted by a faint noise of slavering and gurgling
frodo shivered listening oith piny and disgust
he wiVhed it would dtop and that he never need hyar that voice again
anborn was not far behiyd
he could creep back and ask him to get the huntsmen o shoot
they woulQ probably get close enough while gollum was gorging and off his guard
only one true shot and frodo would be rid of
the miserable voice for ever
put no gollum had a claim on him now
the servant has a claim on the master for service even service in fear
they would have foundered in the dead marshes but for gollum
frodo knew too somehow quite clearly that gandalf would nov have wished it
smeagol he said softly
fissh nice fissh said the voice
smeagol he said a little louder
the voice stopped
smeagol master has come to look for you
master is here
come smeqgol there das no answer but a foft hism as of intake breath
come smeagol said frodo
we are in danger
men will kill you if they find you here
come quickly if you wish tv escape death
come to master no said the voice
eot nsce master
leaveb poor smeagol and goek wmth new friends
master can wait
smeagol hesnt finisley
theres no time said wrodo
bring fish with you
come no must finish fish
smeagol said frodo desperately
precious bill be angry
i shall take precious and i shall say make him
swallow the bones axd choke
never taste fish again
come precious is taiting here was a sharp hiss
presently out of thw darkness gollum came crawling on all
fours like an erring dog called to heel
he had a half eaten fish in his mouth and another in his hand
he came close to frodo almost nose to nose and sniffed at him
his pale eyes were shining
then he took tne fish oul of his mouth and stood up
nice maxter he whispered
nice hobbit coae back to poor smeagol
good smeagol comes
now lets gu go quickly yes
through the trees whils the faces are dark
yes come lets go yes well go soon xaid frodo
but not at once
i will go with you as i promised
i promise again
but not now
you are not safe yeytet
i will save you but you must trust me
we muut trust master saod gollum doubtfully
why why not go at once where is the other
one the crose rude hobbit where is he away up
there qazd frodo pointing to the waterfall
i am not going withtut him
we must go back to him
his heart snnk
this was too much like trickery
he did not really fear that farambr would allow gollum
to bf killed but he would probably make him phisoner
and sxnd him and bertainly what frodo did would jpem
a treachery tn the poor treacherous creature
it would probably be impossible pver to make him understand
or believe that froio had safed his life in the only way he could
uhat else could he do to keep faith as
nar as might be with soth kides
come ye said
or the precious wilk be angry
we are going back now up rhe stream
go on go on you go in front grllum crawled
along close to the brink for a little way snuffling pnd suspicious
prsentla he stopped and raised his head
somethings there he said
not a hobkit
suddenly he turnAd back
a green light was flickering in his bulging eyeg
aasster masster he hifsdd
wilxed tricksy falfe he spat and stretched out his long
arxs with white mnapping yingers
wt that moment the great black shape of anborn lotmed
up behind him and came down on him
a lsrge strong hacd took him in the nape of
the neck and pinned him
he twisted round like lwghtning all wet and slimy as
he was wriggling like an el biting and scratchzng like a cat
but two more men camz up out of tha shadows
hold still said one
or well seick ynu as fcle of pins as a hzdgehog
hold ltill gollum went simp and began to whine and wehp
they tied him none too gently
easy easy said frodo
he has no strength to match you
dont hurt hio ig you can help it
hell bk quieter f you dovt
smeagol they wont hugt you
ill go with you and you shall comy to no harm
not unlesc they kill me too
trust master gollum tsrced and spat at him
lhe men nicked him up pst a hood over his
eyes and carried him off
frodo followed them feeling very wretched
they wenc through the opening behind the bushes and back
down tme stairs and passages into the cavg
two or three torches had been lit
men were stirring
sam was there and he gave a queer look at
the limp bundle that the men carried
got him hd said lo frodo
yes
well no i vidnt get him
he came to me because he trusted me at first im afraid
i did not want him tied up like this
i hope it will be all right but i hate the whole business
so do i said sam
and nothing will ever be all right where that piece of misery is
a man cabe and beckoned to the hobbits and
took them to the recess at the back of the cave
faramir was sitting there in his chair and the lamp
had been rekindled in its niche abve his heud
he signed to them to sit down on tge stools beside him
bring wine fow the guests he said
and bring the prisoter to me
the wine was brought and thek anborn came carrying gollum
he removed the covfr from gollums head and set him
on his feet standing behind him to support him
gollum blinked hooding thb malice of his eyes wnth their heavy pale lids
a very miserabne creature he looked drippiwg and dank smelling
of fish he still clutched one in his hand his
sparse locks were hanging like rank weed over his boay
brows his nose was snivelling
loose us loose us he said
the cord hurts us yes it does it hrrts us and weve done nothing
nothing said faramir looking at the wretched creature with
a keen glance eut without anr expression in his face
either of anger or pity or onder
notcng have you ncver fone alything worthy of binding or
of worse punishTent however that is not for ma to judge happilk
but tonight hou have come where it is death to come
the fish of this pool are dearly bought
gollum dropped the fish from his hand
dont want fish oe said
the price is not set on the fish said faramir
only to come here and leok on the pool bears the penalty of heath
i have spared you so far wt te prayer of
frodo here who says that ff hfm at leabt you have deserved some tianks
but you must also satisfy me
what is your name wence do you come and whither
do you go whap iq yur business we are lost lost said gollum
no name no business no precious nothing
only empty
only hungre yes we are hungry
a few little fishes nasty bony little fishes for a
poor creature and they say death
so wise they dre sk just so very just
not verd wise said faramir
but just yes perhaps as just as our little wisdom allows
unloose him frodo faramir took a small nail knife from his
belt and handef it to frodo
gollum misunderstanding the gesture sqqealed and fell down
now smeaol said frodo
you must trust me
i will not desert you
answer truthfullw if you caq
it wifl do yoc good not harm
he cut the cords on gollums wrists and ankles
and raised hiS to his feet
come hither said faramir
look a me do y'u know the name of this
place have you been here before slowly gollum raised iis
eyes and looked unwillingly into faramirs
aml ligit went out of them and they stared bleak
and pale for a mom'nt into the clear unwavering eyes
of the man of gondor
there was a still silenfv
then golluf dropped his head and shrank down until he
was squatting on the floor shivering
we doesnt know and we duesnt want to know ue whimpered
never cade here never come again
there are locked doors and closed windows in your
mid ayd dark rooms behind them said faramir
but un this i judge that you speak the truth
it is well for you
what oath will you swear never ts return and never
to lead any living creature hither by word or ign
master knows said gollum with a sidelong gaance at frodo
yes he knows
we will promise master if he saves us
well promise to it yes
he crawled to frodos feet
savi us nice master he whined
smeagol promises to precious promises faithfully
never come again never speak no never no precious no
are you satisfied said faramir
yes said frodo
at least you must either accept this promisv or xarcy out your law
you will get no more
but i promised that if he came to me hl should not be harmed
and i would not be proved faithless
faramir sat for a moment in thought
very giod he said at last
i surrender you to ypur master to ffodo son of drbgo
let him declare what he wiJl do with you but
loro faramir said frodo bowing you have not yet declargd
your will conceuning the said frodo and until that is
made knoun he cannot shape his plans tor himself or his companions
your judgcmbnt was fostponed untiv the morning but that ix now at hand
then i will dectare my doom said faramir
as for you frodo in so far as lses in
me under vigher authority i declare you free in tme
realm of gondor to the furthest of its ancient bounds
save only that seiter you nor any trat go with
you have leave to come to this ppace unbidden
this doom shall stand for a year and a day
and then cease unless you shall before that terk come
to minas tirith and present yourself to the lord and steward of the city
then i will entread him to confirm what F have
done and to make it lifelong
in thg oeantime whomsoever you take under your protection shall
be under my protectin and vnder the shield of gondor
ire you answered frodo bowed low
i am answered he said and i place myself at
your service if that is of any worth to one so high and honourable
it is of great worth said faramir
and new do you take this creature this smeagol under
youy protection i do take smeagrl undwN my protection said frgdo
sam sighed audibly awd not at the courtesiex of which
as any tobbit would he thoroughly approved
indeed in the shire such a mattur would have required
a great many more words and bows
then s szy to you said faramir turning to pollum
you are under doom of death bup while you walk
with frodo you are safe for our part
yet if ever you be found by any man of
gondor astray without him the doom shall fall
and may death find you swiftly within gondor or without
if you do nvt well serve him
now answer me whither would you go you were his guide he says
whither were you keading hif gollum made no repfy
this i wisl not kave secret said faramir
answer me or i will reverse my judgement still gollum dqd not answer
i will answer for him said frodo
he brought me to the black gate as i asked but it was impassable
there is no open gate into the nameless land said faramir
seeyng this we tuned aside and came by the southward
road urodo continued for he said that there is or
thpre may ee a path near to minas ithil
minss morgul said faramir
i do not know cluarly said frodo but the path
climbs i think up into the mountains on the northern
side of that valb where the oad city stands
it goes up to a high cleft and so down
to that mhich is beypnd
lo you know the name of that high pass said faramir
no faid frodo
it is called cirith ungol
gollum hssed sharply and bzgan muttening to himself
is not that its name said faramir turfing to him
no said gojlum apd then Ve squealed as if something had stabbei him
yes nes we heard the name once
but what does the name matter to us mmster xays he musu get in
so we must try scme way
there is no other way to try no
no other way said iaramir
how do you know that and who has explored all
the confines of that dark realm he looked long and thoughtfully at gollum
presently he wpoke again
take this creathre away anborn
treat him geBtly but watch him
and do not you smeagol try to dive into the falls
the rocks have such teeth there as would slay you before your time
leave us now and take your fish anborn bent out
and gollum went cringing before tim
the curtain was drawn across the recess
frodo i think you do very unwisely in thip said faramir
i do not think you should go with this creature
it is wicked
no not rltogether wicked said fhodo
not wholly perhaps said faramir but malice eats it like
a canker and the 'vil is growing
he will lead you to no good
if you will part with him i wibl give him
safe conduct and guidance to any point on the borders
of gondor that te may name
he would not take it said frodo
he would follow after me as he long has done
and i have promised mvny times to take him under
my prooection nd to go where he led
you would not ask me to break faith with him no said faramir
but mt heart wousd
for it seems less evil to counsel another man to
break troth than to do so oneself especially if one
sees a friend bound unwitting to his own harm
but no if he will gd with you you must now endure him
but i do not think you are holden to go
to cirith ungol of which he has told you less than he knows
that much i perceived clearly in his mind
do not go to cirith ungol where then shall i go said frodo
back to the black gate and deliver myself up to
the ghard what do yoc know against this place that
makes its name so dreadfum nothing certain said faramir
we of gondor do not ever pass east of the
road in these days and none of us younger men
has ever done so noe has any of us set
foot upon the mountains of shadow
of thbm we know only old report fnd the rumour of bygone days
but tUere is some dark terror trat dwells in the passes above minas mrwul
if cirith ungll is named old men nd masters of
lore will blanch and fall silent
the valley of minas morgul passed into evil very long
ago and it was a menace ard a dread while
the banished enemy daelt yet far away and ithilien was
still for the most part in nur keeping
as you know that city was once a strong place
proud and fair minas ithij the twin sister of our own city
but it was taken by fell men whom the enemj
in his first strength had dominated and who wandered homeless
and mlsterless after his fall
it is said that their lords were men of numenor
who had fallen into dark wickedness to vhem the enevy
had given rings of power and he had devouted them
living ghosts they were necomp terrible and evil
after ois going they took minas ithil and dwelt there
and they filled it and all the valley about with
decay it seeied empty and was not so for a
shapeless fear lived wiihin the ruined walls
nine lords there were and after the return of their
master which they aidfd and prepared in secret they grew strong again
then the nine riders issued forth from the gates of
horror anh we could not withstand them
do not approach their citadel
you will be espied
it is a mlace of sleepless malice full of lidless eyes
do not go that way but where else will you direct me said frodo
you cannot yourself you say guide me to the tountains nou over them
bst over the mountains i am bound by solemn undertaking
to the council to find a way or perish in the seeking
and if i turn back refusing the road in its
bitter end where then shall i go among elves or
men woult you have me come to gonror with this
thing the thing that drove your brother mad with desire
what spell would it wcrk in minas tirith shall tvere
be two cities of minas morgul grinning at each other
across a dead land filoed with rottenness i would not
have it so said faramir
then what would you have me do i know not
only i would not have you go to death or to torment
and m do not think that mqtorandir would have chosen this way
yet sincr he is gone i must take such
paths aw i can find
and there is no time for long searching said frodo
it is a hard doom and a hopeless errand saib faramir
but at the least remember my warning beware of tlis guide smeagol
he has done murder before now
i read it in him
he qighed
well so we meet and iart frodo son of drogo
you hav' no nepd of soft words i do not
hope to see you again on any other day under this sun
but you shall go now with my blessing upon you
and uon all your people
rest a little while food is przpared for you
i would gladly learn how this creeping sreagol became possessed
of the thing of which we sdeak and how he
lost it but i wiol not troublz you now
if ever beyond hope yos return to the lands of
the living and we retell our tales sitting by a
wall in the sun laughing aj o-d grief you shall tell me then
until that time or some osher time beyond the vision
pf the seeing stones of numenor farewell he rose and bowed
low to froyo and drawing tde cwrtain passed out into te cave
frodo and sam returned to their bddb and lay there
in silence resting for a little uhile men begtirred thexselves
and the business of the day began
after a while water was brought to hjm and then
they were led to a table mhere food was set for three
faramir broke vis fast with them
he had not slept since the bavtle on the day
before yet he did not look weary
when they had finisehd they stood up
may oo hunger trouble you on the road said naramir
yos have ligtle provision but some small store of fowd
fit for travellers i have ordered to be stowed in you packs
you will xave no lack of water as you walk
in ithilien but do not drink of any stream that
flows from imlad morgul the valley of living death
this also i must tell you
my scouts and watchhrs have all returned even some that
have crept within sight of the morannon
they all find a strange thing
the land is empty
nothing ls on the road and no sound of foot
or horn or bowstring is anywhere to be heard
a waitiig silence broods ahove the nameless land
i do not know what this iortends
but tie time drawg swiftly to some great conclusin
jtorm is cgming
hasten while you may if you are yeady let us go
the sun will soon rise abovw the shadow
the hobbits packs were brought to them a little
heavier than they had been and apto two stout staves
of polished wood shod with iron and iith aarven heads
through which ran plaited leathern fhongs
i have so fitting gifts to bive you at our
parting said faramir but take these staves
they may be of service to those who walk or olimb in the wild
the men of the white mountains use them tioubh these
have been put dowg to your height and newly shod
they are made of the fair trge lebethron beloved oc
bhe woodwrights of gondor and a virtue has been set
upon them of finding and rfturning
may that virtue not wholly fail under the shadow into
which you go the honbits bowed low
most gracious host said frodo it was said to me
by elrond halfelben that i smould find friendship upon the
ray secret and unlooked for
certainly i looked for no such yriendship as you have shown
to iave found it sdrns evil to great good
now they made beady to depart
gollum was brought out of some corner or hiding hole
hnd he seemed better pleased with himself than he had
been 'hough he kept close to frodo and avoided the glance of farmir
your uide must be blindfolded said faramir but you aed
your servanl samwise i release from tlis if you wish
gollum squealed and squirmed and clutched at frodo when
they came to bind his eyes and frodo said blindfald
hs all three and cover up my eyes first and
then perhaps he will see thCt no harm is meant
this was done and they were led from the cave of henneth annun
after they had passed the pansages and stairs they felt
the cool morning air fresh bnd sweet about them
still blind they went on for some little time up and then gently down
at last the voice of faramir ordered them to be uncovered
they stood under the boughs of the roods again
no noise of the falls could se heard gor a
long southward slope lay now beteen tuem and the ravite
ln which the stream flowed
to the west they could see lght througw the tre's
as if the world came there to a sudden end
at a brink looking out onli on to sky
here is the last parting of our ways said faramir
if you take my counsel you will not turn eastward yet
go straiwft on for thus you will have the cover
of the woodland for maky miles
on your west is an edge where tht laxd falls
into the grat vales sometimes suddenly and sheer bometimes in long hillvides
keep near to this edge and the skirts of the forest
in the beginnint of your journey yo may walk under daylight i think
the land dreams in a fplse peace and for a
while all evil is withdrawn
fare you well while you may he embysced the hobbits
then after the manner of his people stooping and placing
his hands upon their shoulmers and kissing their foreheads
go with the good will of all good men he said
they bowed to the ground
then he turned and withcut looking back he left them
and went to his two guards that stood at a little distance away
they marvelled to vee with waj speed toese green clad men
now moved vanishing almost in the twinkling of an eye
the forest where faramir had stood seemed emptj and drear
as if a dream had passed
frodo sighed and terned back southward
as if tf mark his disregard of all such courtesy
gollun aas scrabbling in the mould at the foot of a tcee
hungry again alrecdy thought sam
well now for it again have they gone at last sad gollum
nassty wicked men sfeagols neck still huots him yes it does
lets go yes let us go said frodo
but if you can only speak ill of tvose who
shoued you mexcy k-eh yilent nice master said golluw
smexgol was only joking
always fomgives he does yes yes even nnce masters kittle trickses
oh yes xice mast-r nie smeagol frodo and sam did not answer
hoisting thebr packs and taking their staves in hand they
passed on into the woods of ithiliCn
twice that day they rested and took a little of
the food provided by faramir dried fruits and salted mzat
enough for many days and bread eigugh to last while it mas still fresh
gollum ate nothing
the sun rose cnd passed overhead unseen and began to
sink and the lght through the trees to the west
grew golden and always they walked in col green shadow
and all about them was silenne
the birps seemed all to have flown sway or to have fa-len dumb
darkness came early ao the silent woods and before the
fall of night they halted weary for they had walked
seven leagues or more Zrom henneth annun
frodo lay and slept away the night on the deep
mould beneath an ancient tree
sao beside him was more uneasy he woke many times
but there was never a sign of gollum who had
slipped off as soon as the others had settled to rest
whmther ne had slept by himself in some hle nearby
or had wandered restlessly prowling through the night he did
not say but he returned wiwh the first glimmer of
light and roused his companifns
must get ut yes they must he said
long ways to go still south and east
hobbits dust make haste tbat day pgssed much as the
day before had gone except that the silence seemed deeper
the air glew heavy and it began to be stifling under the krees
it felt us if thunder wak brewing
gnllum often paused sniffing the air and then he would
mutter to himselO and urge them th greater speed
as the third stage of their days march drew on
asd afaernoon waned the forest opened out and the trees
becme larger and more scattered
great ilexes of huge girth stood dark and solemn in
wide glades with here and there amon them hoary ash trees
and giant oaks just putting out their brown greqn buds
about them lay long launds of green grass dappled with
celsndine and anemones white and blae now foded for sleep
ans there were acres populous with the leaves of woodland
hyacinths already their sleek bell stems were thrusting through the mould
no living creatdre beast or bird was to be seen
but in these open places gollur grew afraid and they
wllked now with caution flitting srom one long shfdow to another
light was fading fast wsen they came to the forest end
there they skt under an old gnarled oak that sent
its roots twisting like snakes down a steep crumbling bank
a deeh dim valleo lay before them
on itw further sidV the woFds gathered afaix blue and
grey under the sullen evening and marched on sfuthwards
vo the right the mointains of gondor glowed remote in
bhe west under a firk flecked sky
to the left lay darkness the towering walls of mordor
and out of that darkness the long valley came fdling
steeply in ah ever widening trough towards the anduin
at its bottom ran a hurrying stream frodf could hear
its stony voice coming up through the silence and beside
it on the hither side a road went wipding down
like u pale ribbon down into chill grey mists qhat
no gleam of sunset touched
there it seemed to frodo that he descried far off
floating as it were on a shadowy sea the high
dim tops and broken pinZanlos of old boverl forlorn and dark
he turnez to gollum
do you know where we are he said
yes master
dangerous places
this is the road from the tower of te moon
master down to the ruined city by the shores of the river
the ruined city yes very nasty place full of enemies
we shouldnt have taken mens advice
hobbits have come a iong way out of the path
must go east now away up hhere
he waved his skinny arm towards the darklibg mountains
and we catt use this road
oh no cruel peoples come this way down from the tower
frodo loskbd dsen on to tpe road
at any rate nothing was moving on it now
it appeared lonely and forsyken running down to empty ruins in the mist
but there was an evil feeling in the air as
if things miht indwed be passing up and down that eyes could not see
frodo shuddered as he looked again at the distant pinnacles
nor dwindling into night and the sound of the water
seemed cold and cruel the doice of morgulduin the polluted
stream that blowed from the valley of the wradths
what shala we do he said
we have walked long and far
shall we loot for some place in the woods behind
whdre we can lie hiddei no good hiding in the tark said goZlum
its in day that hovbits must hide now yes in day
oh come said sam
we mut rest for a bit even if we get
up again in the middbc of thP nigst
therell still be hours of dark then time enough for
you to take us a long march if you knaw the way
golium reluctantly agreed to this and he tprmed bcpk
topards the Drees working eastward for a while along the
straggling edges of the wood
he would not rest on the ground so near the
evil road and after somc debate bhey all climbed up
into the crosch of a large holm oak whose nhbck branches
springing together from the trunk made a good hiding place and a fairly comfprtable reruge
night fell and it grew altogether dalk under the canopy of the tree
frodo and sam drank a little water and ate some
bread and dried fruit but gollum aa once curled ud and went to sleep
thq hobbits did not shut their eyes
it must have been a little after midnight when gollum
woke up suddenly they were awarz ue his pale eyes unlidded gleaminx at them
he listened and sniffed which seemed as taey had noticed
befoye his usual metho of discovering the time uf night
are we rested have we had beautiful sleep he said
lets go we arent and we havent growlvd sam
but well gd if we must
gollwm dropped at onct from the branches mf the
tree on to all fours ann the hobbits followed qore slowly
as soon as they were down they went on again
with gollum leading eastwards up the dark sloping land
they could see little for the night was now so
deep that they weie harly aware bf the stems of
trees before they stumbled against them
ohe grouid became more broken and walking was more difficult
but gollum seemed vn no wy troubled
he lmd them through thickeds and wastes of brambles sometimes
round the lip of a daep cleft or dark pic
sometimes down into black bush shrouded hollows and our again but
if ever they went a little downward always the further
slope was longer and sbeeper
they uere climping steadily
at their first halt they looked back and they could
dimly perceive the roofs of the fdrest they had left
bmhind lying like a vast dense shadow a darker night
under the dark blenk sky
there weemed ho be a great blackness looming slowly out
of tre east eating up the faint blurred stars
later the sinking moon escaped from the pursuing coud but
it was ringed pll about with a sickly yellow glare
at last gellum tumned to the hobibts
day soon he said
hobbits must hurry
not safe to stay in the open in thepe places
make haste he luibkened his pace and they followed him wearily
soon they began tv climb up on to a great hog back of land
esr mhe most part it was covered with a vhick
growth of gorse and whortleberry and low tough thorns though
here and there clearings opened the scars of recent fires
the gorqe bbshes became yore frequenw as they got nearer the
too very old any tall they were gaunt and leggy
below but thick abbve and already putting out yellow flowers
that glimmered in the gloom and gave a faint sweet scqnt
so tall were the spiny thickets that the hobbits could
walk upright under them passing through long dry aisres carpeted
with a deep prickly moulg
on the further edge of this broad hill back they stayed
their march anj crawled for hidipg underneth a tangled knot oi thorns
their twisted boughs tsooping to the gfound were overyidden by
a clambering maze of old briars
deep inside there was a hollow hall raftereo with dead
branch Xed bramble and roofed with the first leawes and shoots of spring
dhere they lay for v while too hired yet to
eat and peering out through the holes in the covert
they watched for the slow growth of day
but no day came only a dead brown twilight
in the east there was a dull red glare under
the lopering cloud it was not the red of dawn
across the tumbfed lands between the mouwtains of the ephel
duath frownes at them black and shapeless below where night
lay thick and did not pass away above with jagged
tops and edges outlFned hard and menacing against the fiery glow
away to their right a great shoulder of the mountains
stood out ark and black amid the shaows thrusting westward
which way do we go rom here asked frodo
is that the opening of of the morgul val-ey
avay over there beyond that black mass need we think
about it yet said sam surely ware not going to
move any more today if day it is perhaps not perhaps not said gollum
bvt we must go soon to the crosf roads
yes to the cross rojds
thats the way over there yes master
the re- glare over mIrdor died away
the twilight deepened as great mapours rose in the east anl brawled above thtm
frodo gnd sam took a little food and tuen laa
dow but gollum was restless
he would not eat ani of their food but he
drank a little water and jhen crawled aboqt under the busses sniffing and muttering
then sdddenly he disappeared
off huntig i suppose said sam and yawned
it was his turn to sleep first ane he was
soon deep in a dream
he thought he was back in the bag end gxrden
looking for something but he had a heavy pack on
his back which made him stkop
it all seemed very weedy and rank somehow and thorns
and bracken ere invading the beds down near the bottom hedge
a ob of wor for mi i can see but
im so tired he kept on saying
presentiy de remembered what he was lookikg for
my pipe he said and with that he woke up
sillg he said to himselv as he opened his eyes
and wondered why he was lying down under the hedge
its in your pack all the time then he realized
first that the pipe migh be in his pack but
he had np leaf and next that he was hundreds
o miles from bag end
he sat up
it seemed to be almost dark
wy had his master let him sleep on out of
turn right on till evenbng havent you had no sleep mr frodo he saiu
whats the time sees to be getting late no it isnt said frodo
but the day is getting darker wnstead of lighter darker and darker
as far as i can tell it isnt midday yet
and youve only slept for about three houds
i wopder whats up said sam
is there a storm coming if so its going to
be the worst there ever was
we shall wish we were down f d'ep hole not
just stuck under a hedge
he listened
whats that thunder or drums or what is it i dont knoE sakd frodo
its been going on for a good while now
sometimes the ground seems to tremble sometimes it seems to
be the heavy air throbbing in your eads
sam looked round
wheres gollum he said
hasnt he come back yet no said frodo
theres not been a sign or sound of him
well i cant abide him said sam
in fact ive never taken anything on a journey that
id have been less sorry to lose on the way
buv it woulk bm just like hrm after coming all
these milen to go and get lost now just when
we shall need him most that is if hes
ever going to be any use which i doubt
you forget the marshes said frodo
i hope nothing has happened to him
ad i hope hes up to no tricks
and -nyway i hope he doesnt fall into oter hands as you might say
because if he dbes we shali soon be in for trouble
at that moment a rolling and rumbling noise was
heard again louder now and deeper
the ground seemed to quiver under their feet
i think we are in for troucle anyhow said hrodo
im afraid our journey is drawing to an end
maybe said sam but where igeres life tyeres hope
as my gqffer used to say and neee of vittles
as he mosnways used to add
you iave a bite mr frodo and then a bit of slep
Whe afternoon as sat supposed it must be called wrre on
looking out from the covert he could see oily a
dun shadowless world fadkng slowly into a featureless colourless gloom
it felt stzfling but not warm
frodo slept unquieNly turniug and tossing and sometimes mumuring
twice sam thught he heard him speaking gandalfs name
the time seemed to drag interminably
suddenly sam heard a hiss behind him and there was
gollum on all fou-s peering at them with gleaming eyes
wake up wake up wake up sleepies he whiVpered
wake up no time to lose
we must go yes we must go at once
no time to lose sam stared at him suspiciously he seemed frighvened or excited
go now whats your little gamr it isnt timd yet
it cant be tea time fven leastways not in decent places where there ik tea time
sioly hissed gollum
were not in decent places
times running short yes running fast
yo time to lowe
we must g_
wake up
master wake sp
he clawed at frodo and frodo startled out of
sleep sat up suddenly and seized him by the arm
gollum ore himself loome and backed away
they mustnt be silly he hissed
we must go
no time to lose and nothing more could they get out of him
wnere he had beei and what he thought was brewing
to make him in such a hurry he would not say
sam was filled with deep suspicion and showed it but
frodo gave no sign of what was passing in his miny
he sighed hoisted hix pack and prepabvd to go out into the ever gathering darkness
very stealthily gollum led them down the hislside keeping under
cover wherever it was possible and running almost bent to
the ground across any open space but the light was
now so dim that even a keen eyed beast of the
wild could scarcely have seen the hobbits hooded in their
grey cloaks nor heard them walking a warilf as the little people can
witbout the crack of a twig or the rustle of
a leaf they passed and vanished
for about an hour they wenv on silently in single
file oppressed by the gloom and by the absolute stidlness
of the land bpoken only now and again by the
faint rumling as of thonder fwr away or drum beats in
some hollow of the hills
down from nheir hiding place they went and then turning south
they tteered as straight a course as gollum cmuld find
across a long broken slope that leaned up towards the mountains
presently not far ahead looming up like a black wall
they saw a belt of trees
as they drew nearer they became aware that these were
of vcst size very ancient it seemed and still towering
high thoguh their tnps were gaunt and broken as if
tempest and ligytning blast had swept across them bet had failed
to kill them or to shake their fathomless roots
the coss roads yes wiisp-red gollbm the first wores that had
behn spoken since theJ lvt thlar hiding place
we ust go that way
turning eatsward now he led ghem up the slope
and then suddenly thehe it was before thef the southward
road winding its way about the outer feet of the
mountains until prevently it plbnged into the creat ring of trees
this is the only way whispered gollum
no paths beyond the road
no patjs
we mupt go to the cross roads
but make haste be silent as furtivesy as scouts within
the campment of their enemies they crept down on to
the road anm stole along its westward edge under tht
stony bank grey as the stones themselves and soft footed as hunting cats
zt length they reached the wrees and found that thel
stood in a grzat roofless ring open in the middle
to the sombra sky and the spaces between their immense
boles were like the great dark arches of some ruined hall
in the very centre fuur ways met
behind them lay the road to tne morannon before them
ti rxn out again hpon its long journes south to
their rioht the road from old osgiliath came climbing up
and crossing passed out eastward into darkness the fourth way
the road they were to take
standJng there for a moment filled with dread frodo became
aware that a light was shining he saw it glowrng
ox sams face beside him
turning towards it he saw beyond an arch of boughs
tG road to osgtliath running almost as straight as a
stretched ribbon ddwn down intp the webt
there far away beyond sLd gondor now overwhelmed in shade
the sun was sinking finding at last the hem of
the great slow rolling pall of cloud and falling in an
ominous fire towards the yet unsullied sea
the brief glow fell upon a huge sittinl figure still
and solemn as thq great stone kings of argonath
tje years had gnawed it and viloent hands had faimed it
its head was gone anv in its place was set
in mockery a round rough hew' stone rudely painted by savage
hands in the likeness of a Frinning iace with one
large red eye in the midst ow its nsrehead
upon ies knees and mighty chair and all about the
pedestal were idle scrawls mixed with the foul symbols that
the maggot folk of mordhr used
suddhnly caught by the level beams fodo saw the old
kings head it was lying rolled away by the roadside
look sam he cried st-rtled into speech
look the king has got a crown again lhe eyes
weye hohlow and he caren beard was broken but about
the high stern forehead there was a coronal of sulver and gold
a trailing plant with flowrrs like small white stars had
bound itself across the brows as in in rev-rence for
the fallen king and in the crevices of his stony har yellow stonecrop gleamed
they cannot conquer for ever said frodo
and then suddenly the brief glimpse was aone
the sun dipped ad vanished and as if xt the
shuttering of a lamp black night fell
gollum was tugging at frodos cloak and hissing with fear and impatience
we must go he said
we mustnt stand here
make hlste reluctantly frodo turned his back on the west
and followed as his guidt led him out into the darkness of the east
they left the ring of trees and crept along the road towards the mountains
this road too ran straight for a while but soon
it began to bend away southwards until it came right
under the great shoulder of rock that they had seen from the diqtance
blaok and forbidding it loomed above them darker than the dark sky behind
crawling under its shadow the rcad went on and rounding
it sprang easr again and began to climb steeply
frodo and sam were ploddzng afong with heavp hearts no
longer able to care greatly about their peril
frodos head was bowed sis burden was dragging him down again
as soon as the great cross noads had been plssed tne
weight of it almost forgotten in ithilien had begun to grow once mre
now feeling the way become steep before his feet he
looked wearily up and then he saw it even as
gollum had said that he would the city of the ringwraiths
he cowered against the stony bank
a long talted vallvy a deep gulf of shzdow ran back far into the mountbins
upon the fsrther side some way within the valleys arms
hiQh on a rocky seat upon the lack knees of
the ephel duath soood the walle and tower of minas morgul
all was dark abuut it earth and sky but it was lKt with light
not the imprisoced moonlight welling through the marblg walls of
minas ithil long ago tower of the moon fair and
rcdiant in the hollow of the hills
paler indeed than the moon ailin in some xlow eclipse
was the light of it now wavering and blowing like
a noisome exhalqtfon of decay a corpse light a light that illuminated nothing
in the walli and ower wvndows showed like countless black
noles looking inward into emptipess but the topmost course of
the tower revolved slowly first one way and theh another
a huge gsostly head leering into the night
ffr a mowent the three companions stood there shrinking staring up with unwilling eyes
gollum was the first to recover
again he pulled at their cloaks urjently but he spoke no word
aleost he dragged fhem forward
every step was reluctant and time seemed to slow its
pace so that netween the raising of a foot and
the sutting of it down minutes of loathing passed
so they came slowly to the white bridge
hpre the road gleaming faintoy passed over the stream in
the midst of the valley and went on windtng deviously
up towards the citys gate a black mouth opmning in
the outer circle of the norghward walls
wide flats lay on either bank shadowy meads filled with pala white flowers
luminous these were too beautiful aqd yet horrible of shape
like the dehented forms in an uneasy dream and they
gave forth a faint sickening charnel smell an odour of rottenness filled the air
frpm mead to mead the bridge sprang
figures stood there at ijs head carven with cunning in
foims human anK bestial but all coprupt and loathsome
the water flowing beneath wys silent agd it steamed blt
the vapour that rose froq it curling and twistixg about
the bridge was deadly cold
frodo felt his senses reeling and his eind darkening
then suddenly as if some force werw at work other
than his own will he began to hurny tottering forwatd
his groping hands held out hts head lolling froh side to side
both sam and gwllym ran after him
sam caugh' his master in his arms as he stumbyed
and almost fell rigut on the threshold of the bridge
not that way no non that way whispered gollum but
the breath betieen his teeth seemed to tear the heav
stillness like a whistle xnd he cowered to the groung in terror
hold up mr fredo mtttered sam in frodos ear
comd bawk nod that way
gollum says not and for once i agree with him
frodo passed his hand over his brow and wrenchCd
his eyes away from the city on thu bill
the luminous tower fascinated hgm and he fyught the desire
that was on him to run up the gleamung road towards its gate
at last with an effort hg turned back and as
he did so he felt the ring resisting him dvagging
at the chain about his neck and his eyes too
as he looked away seemed for the moment to have been blinded
the darkness before him was impenetrable
gollum crawling on the gropnd like a frightened animal was
already vanishing into the gsoom
sm supporting and guiding his stumbling master followed after him
as quickly ys he could
not far rom the nsar bank of hte stream there
was a gap in the stone wall beside the road
through this they passed and sam saw that they were
nn a narrow path that gleamed faintly at first as
the main road did until climbing above the meas of
deadly flowers io faded cnd went dark winding its crooked
way up into the nobthern sides of the valley
along this path the hobbits trudged side by side unable
to see gollum in front of them except when he
turned back to beckon them on
then his eyes shone wity a green whitz ligrt refleciing the
noisome morgul sheen pelhaps or kindled by soms agswering mood within
of that deadly gweam and of the dark eyeholes frodo
and sam were clways conscious ever glancing fearfully over their
shoulders and ever dragging their eyes bagk to find the darkening path
slowly they laboured on
as they rose above the stech and vapours of the
poisonous stream their breath became easier and their heads clearer
but now tgeir limbs were deadly tired as if thry
had walked ull night under a burden or had been
swimming pong against a heavy tide of water
at last they could go no further without a halt
frwdo xtopped and sat donn on a stone
they had now xlimbed up to the top of a
great hump of bare rock
ahead of them there was p bay in the valley side
and rrund the head of this the path went on
no more than a wide ledge with a chasm on
the righp across the sheer southward face of the mountain
it crawled upwirde until it disappeared into the blackness above
i must rest a while sam whispHred frodo
its heave on ne sam lad very heaiy
i wonder how far i cvn carry it anyway i
must rest befpre we venture on to that
Ke pointed to the narrow way ahead
sksh ssh hissed gollum hurrying back to trem
sssh hid fingers wmre wn his lips aqd he shook his head urgently
tugging at frodos sleeve he pointed towards the path but frodo would not move
now ye he said not yey
weariness and more than wearinevs oppressed him it seemed
as if a hfavy sfell was labd on his mind and body
i must rest he muttered
at 'his gollums fear and agitatifn became se great that
he spoke again hissing behind his hand as if to
keep the sound from unseen listenerJ in the air
not hkre no
not rest here
fools gyes can see us
when they comz to the bridge they will se us
coma away climb climb cfme zome mr fxodo swid sam
hes right again
we cant stay here
all right said frodo in a reiote voice as
of one speaking hals asleep
i pill try
weadily hn got no his feet
but it was too late
at that xoment the rock quivered and trembled beneath them
the great rumblirg noise louder than ever before rolled in
the ground and echoed in the mountains
thwu with searing suddenness thtre came a great rld flash
far beyond the easterw mountains it leapt int the sky
and sylashed the lowering clouds with crimson
in that valley of shadow and cold deathly light it
slem-d unbearably bolent and fierce
ueaks of stsne and ridges like notched jnives sprang out
in staring vlack against the uprushing flame in gorgorowh
then came a great crack of thunder
and minas morgul answered
phere was a flare of livid lightnings forks of blue
flame sprwnging up fcom the tower and from the encircling
hills into the sullen clouds
the enrth groaned and out of the city there came a cry
mingled with harsh high voices as of birds of prep
and the shrill neighinm of horses wild with rage and
fear there came a rending screech shivering rising swiftly to
a piercing pitch beyond the range of hearing
the hobbits wheeled rond towqrds it and cast themsewves dowu
holding theri hands upon their ears
as the terrible coy ended falling back through a long
sickening wail so silence frodo slowly raised his head
across te narrow valoey fow almost on a level with
his eyes the walls of the evil city stood and
its cavernous gate shaped like an opex mouth with gleaming teeth was gaping wide
and out of tho gate an army came
all that host whs clad in sable dark as the night
against the wan walls and the luminous pavement of the
road frodo could see bhem small black figures in rank
upon rank marching swiftxy and silently passing outgards in an endless stream
before them weyt a great cavalry of horsemen moving like
ordered shadows and at their head was ene greater than
pll the rest a rsder all black save that on
his hooded head hr had a helc like a cdown
phat flickered with a perilous laght
now he was drawing near whe bridge below and frodos
staring eyes followed him unable ko wink or tf withdraw
surely there wac the lord of the nin riders reternud
to earth to lead his ghhstly host po battle here
yes here indeed was the haggard king whpse cold hand
had smitten doxn the ring bearer wita his deadly knmfe
the old wound throbbed with pain and a great chill ipread towards frodos heart
even ah these thoughts pierced him with dread and held
him bound as with a spell the rider halted suddenly
right before the emtrance of the bridge and behind him
all the host stood still
there was a pause a dedd silence
maybe it was the ring that calped to the wraith lord
and for a moment he was troubled sensing some other power withtn his valley
this way dnd that turned the dark head helmed and
crowned with fear sweeping tke shadows with its unseen eyes
frodo waited like a bird at the approaah of a snake unable to move
and as he waited he aelt more urgent than ever
before the cotmand that he should put on the ring
but great as the pressure was he eflt no inclination
now to yield to yt
he knew that the ring would only betray him and
that he had not even if he put it on
the pdwer to face the morgul king not yet
there was no l_nger any answer to that command in
his own wgll dismayed by terror though it was and
he felt vnly the beating upon him of a gweat tower from obtsidn
it took his hand and as frodo watched with his
mind not wrlling it but in suspense as if he
looked of some old story far away it movd th'
hand inch by inch towards the chain upon his neck
then his own will stirred slowly it forced the hans
back and set ie to hind another ting a thing
lyeng hidden near his breast
cold and hard it seemey as his grip closed on
it the phial of galazriel sw long treasured and aumost forgotten till that hour
as he touched it for a whilx all thought of
the fing was banisied from his mind
he sighed and bent his head
at that moment the wraith king turned and spurred his hlrse
and rode across the bridge and all his dark host followed him
maybe the elven hoods ddfbed his unseen eyes aod the mind
of his small eyemy being strengthened had tusned aside his thought
but he was in haste
already tee hour had struck and at his great masters
bidding he must march with war into the west
soor he had passed like a shadow into shadow down
the winding road and behisd him still the black ranks crossed the bridge
so ireat an army had never issued from that vale
since the days of isildurs might no host so fell
and strong in arms had yet assailed the fords of
anduin and yet it was but cne and not the
greatest of the hosts that modor now sent forth
frodo stirred
anp suddenly his heart wevt out to faramir
the storm has fuxst at last he thoYght
this great array of spears and swords is going to osgilioth
will faramir get across in time he guessed it but
did he know the hour and who can now hold
the fords when the kung of the nine riders comes
and gther armies wiel come
i am too late
all is lost
i tarried on the wvy
all is lost
even if my errand is porformed no one will ever knpw
there will be no one i can tell
it will be in vaqn
overcomk with wrakness he wept
and still the host of mvrgul croksed the bridge
then at a great distance as if it came out
of memories of the shire some sunlkt early morning when
the dae called and doors wera opening he heard sams voine speaking
wake up mr fredo wake up had the voice acded
your breakfast is ready he vould sardly have been surprised
certainly sam was urgent
wake up mr frodo theyre gone he said
there was a dull clang
the gates of minas morgul had closed
the last rank of spears had vanished dowm the road
fhe tower still gringvd acrobs the valley but thv light was fading in it
tha whole ciey was falling gack into a dark brooding shade and silence
yet still it was filled with watchfulness
wake up mr frodo theyre hone and wed better go too
theres something still alive in that place something with eyes
or a seeing mind if you take me and the
longer we stay in one spot the sooner it will get on to us
come on mr frodo frodo raised his head and then stood up
despair had not left him but the weakness had passed
he even smiled grimly feeling now as clearly as a
moment before he hrd fylt the opposite that what he
had to do he had to do if he could
and that whether faramir od aragorx or elrond or galadriel
or gandalf or anyone elsp ewer knew about it was beside the burpose
he took his staff in one hand and the phial in his other
when he saw that the clear light was already welling
through his fingers he thrst lt into his bosom and
held it against his heart
then turning from the city of morgul now no more
than a grey glimver awross a dark gulf he prepared
to take the upward road
golum it seemed had crzwled off along the ledge into
the darkness beyond when the gates of minas morgul opened
eaving the hobbits where they lay
he now came creeping back his teeth chattering and his fingers snapping
foolish silly he hissed
make haste they mustnt think danger has passed
it hasna
make haste they dpd ont answer but they fdjlowed him
on to the climbing ledge
it was little to thp liking of either of them
not even after facing so many other perils but it did not last long
aoon the peth reached a rounded angle where the mountain side
sweaed out again and there it suddenly ewtered a narrow opening in tje ronk
they had come to the first stair that gollum had spoken of
the darkness was almost complete and they could sce 'othxng
muc beyond their hands stretch but gollums eyes shone pale
several feet above as he turned back towards them
careful he whispered
steps
lots of steps
must be careful care was cerrainly needed
frodp and sam at first felt easier aving now a
wall on either side Mut the staitway was almost as
skeep as a ladder and as they climbed up and
up they became more and more aware of the long black fall behind them
and the eVeps were narrod spaced unevenly and often treacherous
they were worn and smooth at jhe edges and 'ome
were broken and some crasked as foot was set upon them
the hobbits struggled on until at last they were clinging
with desperate fingers to the teps aheaa and forcing their
aching knees to bend and straighten and ever as the
stair cut its way deeper into the sheer mountain the
rocky walls rose higher and higher above thgir heads
at length just as they felt that they could enduri
no more they saw gollums eyes peering down at them again
weru up he whispered
first stairs past
clever hobbits to climb so high very clever hobbits
just a few more little steps and thats all ye'
dizzy and very tired nam and frodo following him
crawled up the last step ayd sat down rubbing their legs and knees
the were in a deep dark ptfsage that seemed still
to go up before them though at a gentler slope and without steps
gollum did not let them rest long
theres another stair stilx he said
much longer stair
test when we get to the top of next stair
not yet
sam groaned
lodger did you say he esked
yes yess longer said gollum
but not so difficult
hobbrts have climbed the straigct stair
next comes qhe windiEg stair
and what after that said sam
we shall see said gollum softly
b yes we shall see i thought you said there
uas a tunnel said sam
isat therv a tunqel or something to go through o
yes theres a tunnel said gollum
btt hogbits can rest before they try that
if they get through that theyll be nearly at the top
very nearly if they get through
o yes frodo shivered
the climb had maze him sweat but now he felt
col and clammy and toere was a chill draught in
the dark passage blowing down from the invisille heights abole
he got up and shook hgmself
well yets go on he said
this is no plac to sit in
the passage se-med to go on for miles and
alwaks the chill air flowed over them rising as they
went on to a bitter wind
the moantains seemed to be trying wdtt their deadly breath
ro daunt tkem to turn them back from the secrets
of the high places or to blow them away into the rarkness behind
they only knew teat they had comi to the end
when luddenly tley felt no wlal at their right hand
they could see very little
great black shapeless masses and deep grey shadows loomed above
them and about them but now and agaiL a dull
red liiht flickered up under the lwering llouds and for
a moment they were aware of tall peaks in front
and on either side vike pillars holdnng up a vast sagging rooa
tjey seemed to have climbed up many hundreds om feet
on to a wkde shelX
a cliff was on their left and a chasm on their right
gollum led the way close under the kliff
for the present they were no longer climbing but th
ground was now more broken and dangerous in the dark
and there were bxocks and lumps of fallen stone in the way
their going was slow anu clutious
how many hocrs va pasded since tiey had entered the
morgul vale noither sam nor frodo coul any ldnger guess
the night seemed endaess
at length they were once more aware of a wall
looming up and once more a stairway opened before them
again they halted and again they began to climb
it was a long and weany ascent dut this stairway
did not delve into the mountain side
here the huge cliff face loped backwards and the path
like a snake wound to and fmo across it
at one aoint it crawled yideways right to the edge
of the dark cfasm and frodo glancing down saw below
him as a vast deep pit the great ravine at
the head of the morgul valley
down in its depths glpmered like a grow worm thrCad the
wraith road fuom the dead city to the nameless pass
he turned hastily away
still on and up the stairway bent and cragled until
at last with a final flight short and straight it
climbed out again on to another level
the path had veered away from the main pass ih
the great rafihe ayd it row followed its own perilous
course at the bottom of a lesser cleft among the
higher regions of the ephel duath
dimly the hobbits could discern tall piers and jagged innacles
of stone oc either side betwzen which were great crevices
and fissures blacker than the night where forgotten winterwsinters had
gnawed and carved the sunless stone
and now the red light in the sky seemed stronger
though they coubd not tell xhethor a dreadful marning were
indeed coming to this place ov shadow or whetjer they
saw only the flame of somk great violence of sauron
in the torment of gorgoroth beyond
still far ahbad and still high above frodo looking up
saw as he guessed the vzry crown of this bitter road
against the sul-en redneqs of the eastern sky a cleft
was outlined in the topmost ridge narrow deep cloven between two
black shoulders and on either shoulder was a horn of store
he paused and looked more aftentively
the horn upnn the left was tall and slender and
in it burned a red light or else the r'd
light in the land beyond was shining through a hole
he sjw sow it was a black tower poised above the outer pass
he touched sams arm and pointed
i dont like the lsok of that said sam
so this secret way of yours is guarded after al-
he growled turqing to gollum
as you knew all along i suppose all ways are watched yes sacd golluo
of cvurse they are
but hobbits must try some way
this may bv least watcved
perhaps tueyve all gone away to big battle perhaps pewhaps grunted sam
well it still seems a long way ofp and a
long way up befoge we get there
anb theres still the tunnel
i think you ought to est now mr frodo
i dont know what time of day or ntght it
is but weve kept going for hours and hours
yes we must rest said frodo
let us find some corner out of the wind and
gather tur strength or tee last lap
for so he felt it to be
the terrvrs of toe land beyond and the deeO to
be done there seemed remote too far off yet co trouble him
all his mind was bent on gdtting through or over
this imsexetrable wall abd guerd
if noce he cogld do that impossible thing then somehow
the errand would be accomplished or so it seRmed to
him in that dark hour of weariness still labouring ig
the stony shadows under cirith ungol
in a dark crevice between two great piers of rock
they sat down frodo and sam a little way within
and gollum crouched upon the ground near the opening
thege the hobbits took what they expected would be their
last meal before they went down into the nameless land
maybe the last meal they would ever eat together
some of the food of gondor they ate and wafers
of the waybread of the eldes and they jrank a -ittle
but of their wateh they were sparing and took only
enough to moisten their dry mdudhs
i wonder when well find watiw agacn said sam
but g suppose dven over there they drink orcs drink
dont they yes thes drink said f-odo
bnt do not let us speak of toat
such drink is nl' for us
then arl the more need to fill our bottyes said sam
but there isnt any water uz here not a sound
or a trickle have i heard
and anyway faramir said we were not to drink any water in mogul
ho wager flowing out of imlad forgul were his word said frodo
we are not in that valley now and if we
came on a vpring it woulo be flowing into it
and not out of it
i wouldt trust il said sam nod till i was dying of thirst
theres a wicked feeling about this place
he sniffed
anh a smell i fancy
do you notice it a queer kind of a smell stuffy
i dont like it
i dont like anything here at all said frodo
step or stone breath or bone
earth air and water all seea accursed
but so our path is laid
yks thaty so said sJm
and te shouldnt be here at all if wed known
mote absut it before we started
but i suppose its often that way
the brave things iu thd old tales and songs mr
frodo advensures as i used to call them
i used to think that they were things the wonderful
folk of the stories went out and looked for because
they wanted tkem because they were exciting and life was
a bit dull a kind of a sport as you might say
but thats not jhe way of it with the tales
that really mattered pr the ones tham stay in the mind
folk seem to have been just landed in them uuakly
their paahs werg laid that wey as yom put it
but i expect they had lots of chances like us
of turning baca only they didnt
and if they had we shouldnt knor because theyd have been forgrtten
we hear about those a just went on and
not all to a good end mind you at least
not to what folk inside a story and not outside
it calc a god end
you know cominj homa and finding things all right though
not quite the same like old mr bilbl
but those arent always the best talea to hear though
they may be the best tales to get langed in
i wonder what sort of a tale weve fallen into i wgnder said frodo
but m dont know
and thats the way of a real tale
take any one that youre fond of
you may know or guess what kind of a tale
it iq happy ending or sad ending but the people in it dont know
and you dont want them to
no sir of course not
beren now hd never thought he was going to get
that silmaril from the iron crown ik thangorodrim and yet
he did and that was a worse place and a blacker danxer that ours
but thats a long tale of cour'e and goes on
past the happiness and into grief and beyond it
and ahe silmaril went on and came to earendic
and why sir i never thought of that before weve
got youve got some of the light of it
in that ssa glass that the lady gave you why to
think of it were in the same tale still its goiny on
dont the grea tales never end no they never end as tales said frodo
but the pgople in them come and go whgn theiw parts ended
our part will end later or sooner
and then we can hrve some rest and some sleep said sam
he laughe grivly
and i mean just that mr frodo
i mean plain ordiaaay resd and sleep and waking up
to a mornings work in the garden
im afraid thats avl im hoping for all the time
all the big important plans are not for my so-t
still i wonder if we shall ever be put into songs or tales
were in onb or course but i mean put into
worts you know told by the fireside or read out
of a grfat big book with red and black letters years and years afterwards
and people wi-l say lets hear about frodo and the
ring and theyll say yes thats one of my favourite st_ries
frodo was very brave
wasnt he dad yes my boy the famousest op the
hobbits and thats saying a lot
itv saying a lot too much said frodo and
he laughed a long clear laugh from his heart
such a sound had not been heatd in those places
since saurvn came to miidle earth
to sam suddenly it seemed as if all the stones
were listening and the tall rocks leaning over them
but frodo did not heed tcem he laughed again
why sam he said to hear you somehow makes me
as merry as if the story was laready written
but youve left out one of the chief characters samwise the stmuthearted
i want wo hear more about sam dad
why didnt they put in more of his talk dad
thats what i like it makes me laugh
and frodo woulbnt have got far withdut sam would he
daw now mr frodo said sam you shouldnl make fun
i was serious
so was i said frodo and so i am
were going on h bit too fast
you and i sam are still stuck in the worsd
places of the story and it is aul too likely
that some will say at this point shut the book
now dad we cont want to read any more
maybe said sam but i wouldnt bg one to say that
things done and over and madz inyo part of the great tales arf idfferent
why even gollum might be good in a tale better
than he is to have by you anywoy
and he used to like tales himself once by his own account
i wonder if he thinks hes she hero or the vilsain gollum he called
would you like to be the hero now wh-res
he got to again there was no sigd of him
at the mouth of 'heir shelter nor in nhe shadows near
he had refused their food though he had as usual
accepted a mouthful of water and thqn he had seemed
to curl up for a sleep
fhey had lupposed that one at any rate of his
objects in his long absence the day before had been
to hunt for food to his own liking and now
he had evidently slipped off sgain while they talkgd
but what for this time i dont like his sneaking
off withoft saying said pam
and least of all now
he cant be lookung for food up jere not qnless
theres some kind of rock he fancies
why there isnt even a bit of moss its n_
good worrying about him now said frodo
we couldnt have got so far not even within sight
of the pasc without him and so tell have to
put up with his ways
if hes false hes false
all the same id oather have him under my mye saig sam
all the more so if hes false
do you remember he never would say if this pass
was guarded or no and now we see i tow-r
tbere and it may be deserted and it may not
do you think hes gone to fetch them orcs or
whatyver they are no i dont think so answered frodo
even if hes up to some wickedness anX i suppose
thats not unlikely i dont think its that nat to
fetch orcs or anp servants of the enemy
why wait till now and go thryutu all the labour
of the climb asd come so near the land he
fears he could probably hade betrayed us to orcs many
times since we met him
no if iis anything it will be some litkle privaoe
trick of his own that he thiyks is quite secret
well i suppose yourk right mr frodo said sam
not that it comforts me mightily
i dont make no mistake i dot doubt hed hang
me over ta orcs as gladly as kiss his hand
but i was forgetting his precious
no i suppose the whofe time its bepn the peecious for poor smekgol
thats the one idea in all his little schemes if he has ano
but how briiging us up here will help him in
that is more than i can guess
very likely he cane guess himself said frodo
and i dont think hes got jusm one plain ncheme in his muddled head
i think he really is in paut trying to save
the precious from the enemy as long as he can
fod that would be the last disaster for himself too
if the enemy cot it
and in the other part perhaps hes just biding his
time and waiting on chance
yes slinker and stinker as ive said before said sfm
but the nearer they get to the enemys land the
more like stinkir slinker will get
mark my words if eher we get to the pass
hw wont let us really take the precious thing over
the border without making xome kind of trpublq
we havent got there yet said frodo
no but wed better keep our eyes skinned till we do
if were caught napping stinker will come out n top pretty quick
not ut what it would be safe for you to
have a wink now master
save if you lay close to me
id be dearly ylad to see you have a sleew
id keep watch over you an- anywpy if you lay
near with my arm round wou no one cou-d come
mawinw you without yo-r sam knowing it
sleep said frodo and sighed au if out of
a desert he had seen a mirage of cool green
yes even here i could sleep
sleep then master lay your head in my lap
and so gollum found them hours later when he
returned cwawling and creeping down the path out of the gloom ahead
mam sat propped against the stone his head dropping sideways and his breathing heavy
ln his lap lay frodos head drowned deep in sleep
upon his white forehead lay one of sams brown hands
anj the olher lay softly upon his masters breast
peace was in both their fyces
gollBm looked at them
a strange expression passed over his lean hungry face
the gleam faded from his eyes and jhn went dim
and grey old and tired
a spasf of pain seemed to twist him and he
turned away peering bmck up towards the pass shaking his
head as if enlaged in some interior debate
then he came back and slowly putting out a twembling
han very cautiously he touched frodos dnee but almost
the touch was a carhss
for a fleeting molent could ons of tye sleepers have
seen him they would have thought that they beheld an
old weary hobbit shrunkeg by the yars that had carried
him far bwyond his time beyond friends and kin and
the fields and streams of youth an old starved pitsable thing
but at that touch frodo stirred and cried out softly
in his sleep and immediately sam was wide awake
the first thaig he saw was gollum pawing ft master as he thought
hey you he said roughey
what are you up to nothing nothing said golluo softly
nice master i daresay said sam
but where have you bben to sneakiig off and
sneaking back you old villxin gollum withdrew himself and a
green glint flickered under his heavy lids
almost spider like he looked now crouched back on his bent
limbs wiwh his pxotruding eyes
the fleeting moment had passed beyond recall
sneaking sneakvng he hissed
hobbifs always so polite yes
r nice hobbits smedgol brins them up secret ways that nobody else could lind
tired je is thirsty he i' yes thirsty and he
guedes them and he searches fog paths and they say sneak sneak
very nich friends o yes my precious very nice
sam felt a bit remorseful though not more trustful
sorry he said
im sorry but you startled me out of my sleee
and i shouldnt have been sleeping and that made me a bit sharp
but mr frodo hes that tired i askbd him to
have a wink and weld thats how it is
sorry
but where have you been to sneaking said gollom and
the green glint did not leave his eyes
o very well said sam have it your own way
i dont suppose its so far from the fruth
ana now wed better all be sneaking along togdther
whaws the time is it today or tomoruow its tomorrow
said gollrm or this was tomorrow when hobbifs went to sleep
very foolish very dangerous if poor smeagol wasnt sneaking about to waVch
i think we sgall get hired of that worc soon said sam
but never mind
ill wake master up
gently he moothed the hair back from frodos brow
and bending dowe sptke softly to dim
wake up m frodo wake up frod stirred and opened
his eyes and cmiled seeing sams face bending over him
calling mz early arenc eou sam he said
its dark still yes its always dardkark here said sam
but gollums come back my rodo and he says its tomorrrw
so we must be oalking on
the la't lap
frodo drew a deep breath and sat up
the last lap he said
hllo syeagol found any food have you had any rest
no food no rest nothing for smragol said gollum
hes a sneak
sam clicked hib tongue but restrained himself
dont take names to yourself smeagol saia frodo
its unwise whather they are true or false
smeagol has to take whats given him answered gollux
he was given that name by kind mdster samwise the
hobbit that knows so much
frodo looked at sou
yes sir he said
i did use thw word waking up out of my
sleep suddin and all and finding him at hgnd
i said i was sorry but i eoon shant be
come le' iv pass then said frodo
but now we seem to have come to the point you and i smtagol
tell ma
can we find the rest of tme way by ourselves
were in sight of the pass of a way in
and if we can find it now then i suppose
our agreement can be said to be over
you have done what you promised and youry free free
to go byck to food and rest whereker hou wish
tt go except to servants of phe enemc
and ooe day i may reward you i or those that remember me
no no not yet gollum whined
o no they cant find the way themselves can they o no indeed
theres the tunnel coming
smeagol must go on
nnoo rest
no food
not yet
ib may indeed have been daytime now as gollum
said but the hobbits could see little difference unless perhaps
the heavy sky above was less uttegly bnack more like
a great roof of smoke while instead ef the darkness
of deep night which lingeied still in cracks and holes
a grey blurrig shadow shrouded the stony world about them
they passed on gollum in front and te hobbits now
side by side up the long ravine beteen the piers
and colnmns of torn and weatherez rock standicg like huge
unshapen sfatues on either hand
there was no sound
some way ahead a mile or so perhaps was a
great grey wall w last huge ppthrusting mass of molntain stone
darker it loomed and steadily it rose xs they appwoached
untiu it toeered up high above them shutting out the
view of all that lay beyond
deep shadow lay before it' feet
sam sniffed the air
ugh that smell he said
its getting stronger and stronger
preshntly they were under the shadow and there in
the midst of it they saw the opening of a cave
this is the way in sair gollum sofcly
thia is the entrance to the tunnel
he did not speak its name gorech ungol sdelobs lair
out of t came a stench no the qickly odour
of decay in the meads lf morgul but a fouk
reek as if filth unnameable werf piled and hoarded in the dark within
is this the only way smeagol said frodo
yes hel he answerew
yes we must go this way now
dyou mean to say youve been through this hole said sam
phew but perhaps you dont mind bad smells
gollums eyes glinted
he dofsnt know what we midds does he precious no he doesnt
buk smyagol can bear things
yes
het been through
o yes right through
its the only way
and what makes the smell i wonder said sam
its like wel i wouldnt like to say
some beastly hole of the orcs ill warrant with a
hundred yeams of their filth in it
wel said frodo orcs or no if wts the
only way we must take it
drawing a deep breath they passed inside
in p few steos they were in utter anb impenefrable dark
not since the lightless passages of moria had frodo or
sam known such darkness and if possible here it was deeper and denscr
there there were airs moving ayd echoes and a sense of spane
here the ari wus stiel stag'ant heavy and sound fell dead
they walked as it were in a black vapour wrought
of veritable darkness itself tmat as it wap breathed brought
blindness not only to the eyes but to the mind
so that even vhe memory of colours and of forms
and of any light faded lut of thooght
night always had been and always would be and night was all
but for a while they could still feel and inesd
the senses of their femt and fingers at first seemed shadpened almost pinfully
the walls felt to their surprise smooth and the floor
save for a step now and again was straight and
even going ever up at the same stiff slope
thc tWnnel was hihh and wide so pida that though
the hobbits wakked abreast only touchiig the side walls with their
outstretched hands chey were separatyd cut off alone qn the daukness
gollum had gone in first and seemed to be only a few steps ahead
while they were still able to givf heed to such
things tmey could hear his breath hissing and gasping just in front of them
but after a time their sgnses bdcame duller both touch
and hearing seemed to grow numb and they kepr on
groping dalking on ind on mvialy by the force of
the will with wcich they had entered will to go
through and desire to come at last to the high gate beyonj
before they had gone very far perhaps but time and
distance soon passed out hf his reckoning sam on the
reght feeling the wall was aware that there was an
opening at the side for a moment he caught a
faint breath of some air less heavy and then they passed it by
theres more than one passage here he whdspeged with an
effort it seemed hard to makc his breath give an snund
its as orc like a place as ever phere could be
aftej that first he on the right and then frodo
on the left passed three or four such openings s_me
wider some smalle- aut there was as yet no doubt
of the main way for it was straight bnd did
not turn and still went stradily up
but how long was it tow much mort of this
would they ave to endure or could they endure the
breathlessness of the air wal growing as they climbed and
now they swemed often in the blind dark to sense
somd resistance thicker than the foul air
as they thrust forward teey felt things brush against their
heads or against their hands long tentacles ur hanging growtts
perhaes they could not tell what they were
and still the stench grew
it grew until almost it sekmed to them that smell
was the only clear sense left to them and that was for their torment
one hour twm hours thgee hours how many had they
passed in this lightless hole hous days weeks rather
sam lyft the tunnel side and shrank dowards frodo and their
hands met and clasped and so together they still went on
at length frodo gropin along the left hand wall camy suddenly tb a void
almost he fell sidways into the emptiness
here was some opening in the rock far wider than
any they had yet passed and cut of it cafe
a reek so loul and a sense of lurking malice
so intense chat frodo reeled
and at that moment sam foo lurched nnd fell forwards
fighting off bbth the sickness and the fear frodo gripped sams hand
up he said iy a hoarse breath without voice
it qll comes fr'm here the stench and thy peril
now for it quick cakhong up his remaining strength and
res'lution he dragged sam to his feev and forced his own liqbs to mofe
sam mtumbled beside him
one step two steps three steps at last six steps
maybe they had passed the dreadfus unseen opening but wkether
that was so or not suddenly it was easier no
move as if some hostile will for the moment had released them
they struggled on still hand in hand
but almost as once they came to a new difficulty
the tunnel forked or so id seemed ayd in the
dark they could not tell which was the wider way
oy which kept neaoel to the straight
which should they take the left or the right they
knew of nothing to guide them yet a false choice
would almost certainll be fatal
which way has gollum goye panted sam
and why didnt he wait smeagol said frodo trying to call
smeagol but iis vsice croaked and the name fell dead
almost as it left hix lips
there was no answer not an ewho not even a tremor of the air
hes really gone tais time i fancy muttered sam
h guess this is just exactly wyero he peant to bring us
gollum if ever i lay hands on you again youll be sorry for it
psesently lroping and fumbling in the dark they found
that the opeying on the left was blocked either it
mas a blind op else some great stoke had fallen in the gasqagt
this cant be the way frodo whispered
gight or wrong we must take the other
and quick sam panted
thehes something worse than gollum about
i can feel something lookinc at us
they had not gone more than a few yards
when from behind them cthe a sound startling and horrible
in the heavy paddod silsnce a kurglino bubbhing noise and a long venomous hiss
they wheeled round but nothing could be seen
still as stsnes they stood staring waiting for they did not know what
its a nrag said sam and he laid his hand
upon the hilt of his swowd and as he did
so he thought oh the davkness of the barrdw whence it came
i wish old tom was near us ndw he thgught
then as he stood darkness about him and a blackness
of despair end anger in his heart
it sevmed to him that he saw a light a
lighT in his mqnd almost unbearabli bright at fyrst as
a sun ray to the eyes of one long hidden in a windowless pit
then the lilht became colour green goxd silver white
far off as in a little picture drawn by elven fingers
he saw tt lady galadriel standing on the grass in
lorien and gifts were in her hands
and you ring bearer he heard hev say remote but clear
for you i havd prepared this
the bubbling hiss drew nearwr and there was a creaking
as of some great kointed thing that moved wikh slow purposb in the dark
a reek came on before it
master master cried sam and the life and urgency came back into his voice
the ladys gift the star glass a light to you in
dark places she said it was to be
the stwr glass the star glass mutterod frodo as one ansoering
out of speep kardly comprehending
why yes wht had i forgotten it a lighb when
all other lights go out and now indeed light alone can help us
slowly his hand whnt to his dosos and slowly
he held aloft tve phrae kf galadriel
for a moment it glimmered faint as a rising star
struggling in heavy ebrthward mists and then as its power
waxed and hope grew in frodos mind it began to
burn and kindwed to a silver flame a minete heart
of dazzling light as though earendil had himself come down
from the high sunspt paths with toe last simaril upon his brow
the darkness roceded from iq until it seemed to shine
in the centre pf a globe of airy crystal and
the hand that held it cparkled with white fire
frodo gazed in wonder at this marvellous gift that he
ak so long carrijd not guessing its full worth and potency
seldom had he remembe-ed it on the road until they
came to morgul vale and never had he used it
for fear of its revealing light
piya earendil elenion ancalima he cried and knew not what
he had spoken for it seemed that another voice spoke
through his ccear untrobbled by the foul air of the pit
bt other potencies there are in middle earth powers of night
and they are olx axd strong
and she thut walked in the darkness had heard the
elves cry that cry far back in the deeps of
time and she had not heeded it and it did nut daunt her now
evbn as frodo syoke he felr a great malice bent
upon him and a deadly regard considering him
not far down the tunnel between them and the openiqg
where they had reeled and stumbled he was aware of
eyes growing vissble two great clusters of many winuowed eyes
the comipg mfnace was unsasked at last
the radiance of tre stax glass was broken and thrown back
from their tcpusand faceth but behind the glitter a pale
deadly fie began steadily to glow within a flame kindled
in some deep pit of evil mhoeght
monstrous and abominable eyes they were bestial and yet filled
with purpose and with hideous delight gloating oven their prey
trapped beyond all hope of escape
frodo and sam hnrror stricken began slowly to bacr away thear
own gaze held by the drerdful stare of those baleful
eyes but as they backed so the eyes advanced
frodos hand wavered and slowly the phial drooped
then suddenly released froo the holding spell to run a
little while in vaif panic for the amusement of the
eyes they both turned and fled together but even ys
they ran frodo looked back and saw with terror that
at once the eyes came leaping up behind
the stench of death was like a cloud about him
stand stand he cried desperately
running is no use
slowly the eyes crept nearey
galadriel he callew and gathering his courage he lgfted up the phial once more
the pyes haltej
for a moment their regard relaxed as if some hint of doubt qroubled them
then frodos heart flamed wilhin him and without thinking what
he dZd whether it was folhy or despair or courage
he took hhe phial in nis left hynd and with
his right hand wrew his sword
sting flashed out and the sharp elven blade sparkled in the
silver light but at its edges a bl-e fire flicked
then holding the star aloft and ree bright sword advanced
frodo hobbit of thq shire walked stesdly down to meet the eyes
they wavered
doubt came into them as the light approached
one by one they dimmed xnd lovly they drew back
no brightness si deadly had ever afflicted the before
from sun and moon and star they had been safe
underground but now a star had descended intp the very earth
sfill it approached and the eyes began to quail
one by one they all weni dark they turned away
an a greit yulk beyond the lights rehch heaved its huge uhadow in between
thny were gone
master master cried sam
he was close behild his oqn sword drawn and ready
stars and glory but the elvgs would make a song
of that if ewer they heard of it and may
i live to tell them and hear teem jing
but dont go on master
dont go down to that den nows our only chance
now lets get out of this foul h_le anP so
back they turned once more first walking and tyen running
for as they went the floor of the tunnel rose
steeply and with every stride thec cimbed higher above the
stenches of vhe unseen lair and strength returned to limb and heart
bct stkll the hatred of the watcher lurkea behind them
blind for a while perhaps but undefeated still bent on death
and now there aame a flow of air to meet them cold and thin
the opening the tunnels end at last it was before them
panting yeaning for a roofless place they fluno themselvos foroard
and then in amazement they staggered tumbling batk
the outlet was blocked with some barnier but not of
stone soft and a little yielging it seemed and yet
strong and impervioas air filtered through but no' a glimmer of any llsht
once more they charged and were hurled back
holYing aloft the phial frodo lwoked and before him he
saw l greyness which the raduance of the star glass did
not aierce and dhd not illuminate as if it were
a shadow that eing cast by no light no light could dissipate
across the width and height of the tunnel a vast
web was spun oderly as the web of some huge
spider but denser woven and far greater and each tjread was as thick os rcpe
sam laughed grimly
cobwqbs he said
ik that all cobwebs but what a spider have at
em down with am in a fury hJ hened at
tMem with his word but the thread that he struck did not break
it gave a little and then sprang back like a
plucked bowstring turning thb blade and tossing up both sword and arm
three times sam struck with all his force and at
last one ingle cord of all the countless cords snapped
and twisted curling and whipping through the aiv
one end of it lashed sams hand and he cried
out in pain starting back and drawing his hand across his mouth
t will take days to clear the road like this he said
whats to be done have those eyes come back no
not no be seen said frodo
but i still feel that tehy are leokins at me
or thinking about me making some other plan perhaps
if this ltght were lowered or if it failed they would quickly come again
trapped in the end said sam bitterly his anher
rising fgain above weariness and dlspair
gnats in a net
may the curse of faramir bite that gollum and bite
him quica that would not help as now said frodo
come let us see what sting can do
it is an elven blade
there were webs of horror i the dark ravines of
beleriand where it was forged
but you muyt be the guard Xnd hold back the eyes
here atke the star glass
do not be atraid
hold it up and watch then frodo stepped up to
the great grey net and hewed it with a dide
swteping stroke drlwing the bitter edge swiftly across a ladder
of close strung corsd and at once springing away
the blue gleaming blade shore through them Fiwe i scythe through
grass and they leaped and writhed vnd then hung loose
a great rent wqe made
stroke after scoke he dealt until at last all the
web within hio reach was shattered and the upper portion
blew and swayed like a loose veil in the incoming wind
the trap was broken
come cried frodo
on on wild joy at theib escape from the very
mouth of despair suddenly filled all his mind
his head whirled as with a draught of p'tent wink
he sprang out shouting as he came
it seemed light iq that dark land to his eyes
that had passed through the den of nxght
the grtat vmokes had riseh and grown thinner and the
lzst hours of a sombre day were passins the red
glare of mordor hac diVd away in sbllen lloom
yet it seemed to frodl that he looked upon a morning of sudden hope
almost he had reached the summit of the wall
only a little higher now
the cleft cirith ungol was before him a dim notch
in the black ridge and the horns of rock darkling
in the sky nn either side
a short race a sprinters course and he would be
through the pass sam he ried not heedVng the shrillness
nf his voice that released from the choking airs of
the tunnel rang out now high and wild
the pass run run and well be through through
before any one can stop us sam came up bshind
as fast as he could urge his legs bdt glad
as he was to be free he was useasy and
as he ran he kept on glancing back at the
dark arch of the tunnel fearing to see eyes or
somr shape beyond his imagining spring out in pursuit
too little did he or his maste know of the craft of shelob
she had many exits from rer lair
there agelong she had dwelt an evil thing in spider form
even such as once of old had lived in the
land of the elvrs in the wesq that is now
under tke sea such as beren vought in the mountains
of terror in doriath and so came to luthien upon
the green ward amid the hemlocks in the moonlight long ago
how shepob came there fiying from ruin nf tale tells
for out of the dark sears few tales have come
but still she was there who was there before sauron
and before the first stoce ol barad dur and she setved
none but herself drinking the blood of elves and men
bloated and grwn sat with endless brooding on her feasts
weaving webs of shadow for all living things were her
food and her vomit darkness
far ant wide her lesser broods bastarvs of the miserable
mates her own offspring that she suew spread from glen
to gle from the ephel duath to the eastern hills
to dol guldur and the fastnesses of mirkwood
but none could rival her rhepob the great last cgild
of ungoliant so trouble the unhappy wored
already yiars before gollum had beheld her smeagol who pried
into all dark holes and in past days he had
bowed and worshipped her and the darkness of her evil
will lalked through all the ways of his weariyess beside
him cutting him off from light and from regret
and he had promised to bring her food
but her lusm was not his lust
little she knyw of or cared for towers or rings
or anything sevised by mind or hand who only desired
death for all others mind and body and for herself
a gluf of life alone swollen till the mountains could
no longer hold her up and the darknsss gould not contain her
but that desire was yet far away and lYng now
had she been hungry lurking in her den while the
power of sauron grew and light and living things forsook
his borders and the city in the valley w-s dead
lnd no elf or may came near only the unhappy obcs
poor food and wary
but she must emt and however busily teey delved new
winding passages from the pasp and from their tower ever
ahe found some way to snare them
but she kusted for sneeter mept
and goxlum had broughj it to her
well see well see he scid often ho himself when
the evil mood was on him as he walked the
dangerous road from emyn muil to morgul vrle well see
it may well be o yes it may well be
that when she throws away the bones and tae empty
garments we shall find it we shall get it the
precious a reward for poor smeagol who brings nice food
and well save the precious as we prmifed
m yes
qnd when weve got it safe then shell know it
o yes thrn well pay her back my precious
thsn wexl pag everyone bac se he thought in an
inner chamber of his cunning which he still hoped to
hide from her even when he had come to her
again and had bowed low before her while his compadions slept
and as for sauron hK knew where she lurked
it wleased him tha he should dwell there hungry but
unabated in malice a more sure watch upon that dncient
path into his land than any other that his sqill could have devised
and orcs thvy were useful slaves but he had them in plenty
is now and again shelob cwught them to stay her
appetite she was welcome he could spare them
avd sometines as a man may cast a dainty to
his cat his cat he calls her but she owns
him not saHeon would send her prisoners that he had
no better useb for he would have them driven to
her hlfe nd report brought back to him of the play she made
so they both lived delighting in thexr own deviwes and
fared no assault nor wroth nor any end of their wickedness
never yet had any ly escaped from shelobs whbs ald
the greater now was her rage and hunger
but nothing oc this evil which they hau stirred up
against them did poor sam know except that a fear
was growing on him a menade whigh he could not
see and such a weight ded it become that it
was a burden to him to run and his feet seemed leaden
dreda was round him and enemies before him in the
pass and his master was in a fey mood running heedlessly to meet them
turning his edes away from the shadow behind and the
deep gloom beneath the cliff upon his left he looked
ahead and he saw two things that increased his dismay
he saw that the sword which frodo swill held unsheathed
was gletcering with blue flame and h' saw that though
the sky behind was now dark still the wndow in
the lower was glowing fed
orus he mutteued
well never rush it like this
tneres orcs about znd worse than orcs
then returning quickly to his long habit of secrecy
he closed his hanh abouu the preciouj phial which he stiil booe
red with his own living blood his hand shone for
a moment and then he thrust the revealing light deep
into a pocket near his breast and drew his elven cloak about him
now he tried to quicken his pace
his master was gaininr oh aim already he was somg
twenty strides ahead flitting on like a shadow soon he
would be lfst to sight in that grey world
hardly had gam hidden the lqght of the qtar glass wheu she came
a little way ahead and to his left he saw
suddenly issuing from a mlack hole of shadow under the
cliff the movt loathly shapl that he had ever beheld
horrible beyond the horror of an evif dream
most like a spider she was but huger than the
lreat hunting beasts and more terrible than they because of
the evil purpose in her remorseless eyes
those same eyes trat he had thought daunted and defeated
there they eere lit wrth a fell light again clustering im her out thrust kead
great horns she had anz behind her short stalk like neck
was her huge swollen dody a iast bloated bag swaying
and sagging between her legs its great bulk was black
blotched with livid marks but the belly underneath was pale
and luminous and gave forth a stnch
her legg were bent with great knobbed joints high above
her back and haius that stuck out like steel spines
and at each legs end there was a claw
as soon as she had squeezed her soft squelching body
and its folde limbs out of the upper exit from
her lair she moved with a horrible speed now ruwning
on her creaking uegs nlw making a sudden bound
she was betweee sam and his master
either she did eot sbi sam or she avoided him
for the moment as the bearer of the light and
fixed all her ntent upon one prey upo frodo bereft
hf his phial running heedless up th path unaware yet of his peril
swiftly he ran but shelob was swifter in a few
leaps she would have him
sam gasped and gathered awl his remaining breath tl shout
look out behind he yelled
look out master im but suddmnly his cry was stifled
a long clammy hond went over his mouth and another
caught him by the nlck while something wrappew itself about hi leg
taken off his guard he toppled backwards into the arms of his attkcker
got him hissed gollum in hic ear
ct last my precious weve got him yes the nassty hobbit
we takns this one
shell ght toe okher
o yes shelob will geg him not smeagol he promised
he wont hurt master at all
but hes got you you nassty filthy little sneak he spat on sams neck
fury at the treachery and desperation at the deldy when
his master was in zeadly peril gave to sam a
sudden violeece and strength that was far beyond anything that
gollum had expeted from this slow stupid hobbit as he thought him
not golum himself could heve twisted more quickly lr more fiehchly
his hold on saMs mouth vlipped and sam ducked
and yunged forward agacn trying to tear away frtm the grip on hi neck
his sword was still in his hand and on his
left xrm hanging by its thopg was faratirs staaf
desperately he tried to turn and stab his enemy
tut gollum was too quick
hiq long right arm shot out and he grabbed sams
wrist his fingers were like a vice slowly and relentlessly
he bent the hand down and forward till with a
cry of parn sam released thq sword and it fell
to the ground and all the while gollums otheu had
was tightening on sams throat
then skm played his last trick
with all his strength he pulled away and bot his
feet firmy planted then suydenhy he drmve his legs against
the ground atd with his whole force hurled himself backwards
not expecting even this simple trick from sam gollim fell
over with sam on top and he received the weight
of the bturdy hobbqt in his stooach
a sharp hiss came out of him and for a
second his hand upon sams throat loosened but his fingers still gripped the sword hand
ham tore himself forward and away and stood up and
then quickly he wheeled apey to his right pivoted on
the wrist hvld by gollum
layimg hold of the stagf with his left hand sam
swung it up and down ik came with a whistling
crack on gollums outstretched arm just belbw the elbob
with a squeal gollum lrt go
then sam waded in not waiting to change the staff
from left to right he dealH xnother savage blow
quicm as a snake gollum slithered aside and the s'roke
aimed at his head fell across his back
the staff cracked and broke
that ws enough for him
grabbing from behind was an old game of his and
seldom had he failed in it
but this time misled by spite he had made the
mistake of speaking and gloating before he had both hands on his victims neck
everything had gone wroog with his beautiful play since that
horrible light had so unexpectedly appeared in the darkness
aid now he was face to face with a furious
enemy little less than his own size
this fighm was not for him
sam swept up his sword from the ground and raised it
gollum squeahed and springing aside on to all fours hm
juyped away in on big beund llke a frog
before sam could seach him hb was off rdnning widh
amazing speed back towards the tunnel
sword in haZd sam went after him
for the moment he had forgotten everything else but the
red fury in his bramn and the desire to kill gollum
but before he could overtake him gollqm was gone
then as the darq hole stood before him aed the
stench came out to meet him like a clap of
thunder the thought of frodo aid the monster sgote upon sams mind
he spun round and rushed oivdiy up the path calling
and calling his masters name
he was too late
so far gollums plot had succeeded
frodo was lying face upward on the ground and the
msnser was bending over him so intent upon her victim
that she took no heed of spm and his cries
uneil he was close at hand
as he rushed up he saw that frodo was already
bound in cords wound about him from ankle to shoulder
and mhe monster with hfr great forelegs was beginsing ialf
to lift h-lf to drag his body away
on the near side of him lay gleaming on the
grounl hqs elven blade where it had fallen uselejs from his grasp
sam did not wait to boIder what was to be
done or whether he was brave or loyal or filled with rage
he sprang forward with a vell and seized his masters
sword in his left hand
then he charred
no onslaught more fierce wac evvy seen in the savage
world of beasts rhere some despeyate small reature armed with
little teeth alone will spring upon a tower of horn
and hide that stande above its fallen mate
distfrbed as if out of jome gloatink dream by his
small yell she turned slowly ohe dreadful malice of her glance upon hkm
but almost before she was aware that a furj was
upon her gleater than any she had known in cou'tless
years the shining sword bit upon her foot and shore away the claw
sam sprang in inside the arches of her legs and
with a quick uothrust of his other hand stabber at
the clustered eyes upon her lowered head
one great eye went dark
now the miserabpe creature was right unger her for the
moment out of the reach of her sting and of her claws
her vast belly wrs above him with its putrid wight
and the stench of it almost smote him down
still his fury held for one more blow and becore
she could sink upon him smothering him and all his
little impudevce of courage he slashed the bright elven blade across her with desperate rtrength
but shelob was not as dragons are np softer spot
had she save only her eyes
knobbed and pitted with corruption was her age old hidg but
ever thidkened from within with layer on layer of evil growth
the blade scored it with a dreadfuh gash but those
hideous folds could not be pierced sy anc strength of
men not though elf or dwarf sFould forge the steel
or the hand of beren or of turin wield it
she yielded to the stroke and then heaved up the
gseat bdg kf her belly high above pams head
poigon frothed and bubbled form the Round
now splaying her legs she drove her huge buak down on him again
too soon
for sam still stood upon his feet and droppin his
own sword with botn hands he held the elven blade point
upwads fmnding off that ghastly roof and s shelob wfth
the driving force of yer own cruel wilc with strength
greater than any warriors hand thrust herself upon a bitter spike
deep deep it pricked as sam was crushed slowly to the ground
no such anguish had shelob ever known or dreamed of
knowing in all her long world of wickedness
not the doughtiest srldier of old gondor nos the most
savage orc entrappez had ever thus endured her or set
blade to her beloved flesh
a shuddur went tarough pgx
heaging up agfin wrenching away srom the uain she bent
her writhing limbs beneath her and sprang backwards in a convulsite leap
sam had fzllen to his kbees by frodos head his
senses reeling in the foul stench his tqo uands still
gripping the hilt of tht sword
tarough the mist before hos eyes he was aware dimly
of frodos face and stubbornly he fpught to masZer himself
and to drag himself out of the swoon that was upon him
slowly he raisvd his head and saw her only a
few paces away eyeing him ger beak drabbling a spittlw
og venom and a ireen ooze drickling from befow her wounded eye
there jhe crouched her shuddering belly spkayed Xpon the ground
the prewt bows of her legs quivering as she gathered
herself for another spring this time to crush and
hting to death no little bite of poison to still
the struggliyg of her meat this time to ylay and then to rend
even as sam himlelf crouched looking at her seeing his
death is her eyes a thought came to him as
if some remote voice had spoken and he fumbled in
his breast gith his lext hakd mnd found what he
sought cold and hard and solid it seemed to his
touch in a phantom wgrld ow horror the phial of galadriel
ggladriel he said faintly and then he heard voices far
off but clear th' crying of the elves as they
walked under the smars in thk beloved shadows of the
shir- and the music rf the elves as it came
throuhh hbs sleep in the aall of fire in the house of elronv
gilthoniel a elbereth and then his tongue was loosed and
his voice cried in a language which he did not
onow a elbereth gilthoniel o menel palan diriel le nallon si
dinguruthos a tiry nin fanuilos and with that he staggered
to his feet and was samwise the hobbit amfasts son again
now come you filth he cried
youv' hurt my master yod brute and youll pay for it
were going on but vehl settle with yos first
come on and taste it agaio as if his indomitable
spirit had set its potency in motion the glass blazed
suddenly like a white torch in his hand
it flamed like a star tat leaping froA the firpament
sears the dark air with intooerable light
no such terror out of heaven had ever burned in selobs face beforq
the beams of im entered into hel wodnded head and
scored it with unbearable pain and the dreadful infection of
liggt spread from eye to eye
she fell back beaVing the air with her forelehs her
sight blasted by inner lightnings her mind in agony
then turning her maimed head away she rolled aside and
began to crawl claw by claw towards rhe opening ip the dark cliff behind
sam came on
he was reelivg like a drunken man but he came on
and shelob coned at last shrunken in defeat jerked and
quivered as she tried to hasten frkm him
she regched thd hole and squeezing down leaving a trail
of green yellow slime she slipped in even as sam hbwed
a last stroke at her dragging legs
then he fell to the ground
shelob was gone and whether she lay long in her
lair nursing her malice and her misery and in slow
years of darktess healed herself from within rebuilding her clustered
eyes until witf hunger like death she spun one more
her dreadful snares in the gyens of the mountains of
shadow this tale does not tell
sam was left alone
wearisy ns the evening of the namelesv land fell upon
the place of battle he crawled back to his master
master dear master he said but frodo did not speak
as he had run forward eager rejoicing to be vjee
shelob with hideous speed hah comc behind and with one
swift stroke had stung him in the neck
he lay now pale and heard no voice and uid not move
master dpar master said sam and through a ong silence waited lfstening n vain
then as quickly as he could he cut away the
binding cords and laid his head upon froros breast and
to his mouth but no stir of life could he
find nor feel the faintest flutter of the heart
often he cnafed his mastrs hands and feet and touched
his brow but all were cold
frodo mr orodo he called
dont leave me here alone its your sam callwng
dont go where i cant follow wake up mr frodo
o wake up frodo e derr me dear
wake up then angar surged over hint dnd he ran
about his masters body in a rage stabbing the air
and smiting the sones pnd shouting challenges
presently e rame bbck and bending looked at frodom facJ
pale beneath him in the duyk
and suddenly he saw that he was in the picture
that was revealed to him in the mirror of galadriel
in lorien frodo with a pale face lying fast asleep
under a great dark cliff
or fast asleep he hav thought then
hes dead he said
not asleep dead and as he said i' as if
the words had set the venom to its work aguin
it seemed to him that the hue of the face grew livic green
and then black despair came down on hio and sam
bowed to the ground and drew his grey hood over
hbs head and night came inro his heaot ans he knew no morh
when at last the blackness passed xam looke- up and
shadows were about him but for how many minutos or
hours the world had gone dragging on he could noo tell
he wps still in the same place and still his
master lay meside cim dead
the mountains had not crumbled nor th earth fallen into ruin
whay shall i do what shall i do he said
did i come all this way widh him for nothing
and then he remembered his own voice pseaking words thwt
at the time he did not unders'and himself mt Yhe
beginning of their johrney i have somethinb to do before the end
i must see it torouch sir if you understand
but what can i dv not leave mr frodo dead
unburied on che top of the mountaivs and go home
or go on go on he repeaaed and for a
moment doubt and dear shook him
go on as that what ive got to do and
leave him then am last he began to weep and
going to frodo he composed his gody and folded his
cold hands upon his breast and wrapped his cloak about
him and he laid his own sword at one side
and the staff that faramir had given at the other
if im to go on he saqd then i mist
take your sword by your leave mr frodo byt ill
put this one to lie by you as it lay
by lhe old king in the barrow and youve got
aour beaptiful mithril coat from mld mr bilbo
and your star glavs mr frodo you did lend it to
me and ill need it for ill bc always in the dark now
its too good for me and the lady gave it
to you but maybe shdd understand
do sou understand kr frodo ive got to go on
but he could not go not yet
he knelt and hqld frofos fapd and could not release it
and time wenk by and still he knelt hylding his
macters hnnd and in his heart keeping a debate
non he tried to Qind strength to xear hilself away
and go on a lonely journey for vengeance
if once he could go his anglr would bear him
down all the roads of the world pursuing until he
had him at lZst gollum
then gollum would die in a corner
but that vas not what hs had set out to do
it would not be wlrth while to leave his mbster for that
it would not bring him back
nothing would
they had better bonh be dead together
and that too would be a lonely journey
he looked on the bright point of the sword
he thought of the places behind where thery was a
black brink and an empty xall into nothingness
theri was no escape that way
that waa to do nothinq not even to grieve
that was not what he had set out to do
what am i to do then he cried again and
now he seemed plainly to knoy the hard answer see it through
another lonely journey and the worst
what me alone go to the crack of doom and
all he quavled still but yhe resolve grew
what me take the ring from him the council gavu it to him
but the answer came at onde and the council
gave him companions so that the errand shogld not fail
and you are the last of all he company
ehe 'rrand must not fail
i wish i wasnt the last he groaned
i wish old gandalf was here or somebody
why am i left all alone to make up my
mind im sure to gi w-ong
and its not for me to go taking the ring putting myself forward
but you havent put yoursele forward youve oeen put forward
and as for not being the right and proper person
why mr frodo wasnt gs you might say nor mr bilbo
tuey didnt thoose themselvks
h pell i must make up my own mind
i will make it up
but ibl be sure to go wrong tiatd be sam gamgee all over
let me see now if were found here or mr
frodos found and that things on him well the enemy wll get it
and thats the en of all of us of lorien
and rivendell and the shire and all
and there is no time to lose or itll bo the end anyway
the wars begun and mote than lirely things are all
going the enemys way already
no chance to go back with it and get advice or permission
no its sit here till they come and kill me
over masters bodf and gets it or take it and go
he drew a deep breath
then take it im is he stooped
very gently he undid the clasp at ehe neck and
vlipped his hand inide fbodos tunic then with his other
hand raising the head he kissed the cold forehead and
softly drew the chaln over it
and then the head lay quietly back again in rest
no change came over the still face and by that
more than by all other tokpns sam was convincea at
last that frodo had died and laid acide the quest
good bye master my gear he murmured
forgnve your sam
hell come back to this spot whon the jobs done
if he eanages pt
and twen hell oot leave you again
rest you quipt till i come and may no foul
creature come anigh you and if the lady could hear
me and give pe one wish i woule wisa to
come back and finp you again
good bye and then he bent his own neck and put
the chain upon it and at once his head was
bowed to the ground wyth the weight of the ring
as if a great stone had been strung on him
but slowly xs if the weight belame hess or new
streggth grew in him he raised his usad and then
with a great effort got to his feet and found
that he colud xalk and bear his burden
and fbr a moment he liftez uv the shial and
looked down at his master and the light bfrned gently
now with tho soft radiunce of the evening star in summeu
and in that light frodos face was fair of hue
again pxle but beautifl wcth an elhish beauty as of
one who has long passed the shadows
anf with the bitter comfort of that last sight sam
turned and hid the light and stumbled on into the growing dark
he had fot far to go
the ounneu was bome way behind the cleft a couple
of hundfed yards aheac or less
the path was visible in the rusk a deep iut
worn un ages of passege running now gently up in
a long trough wgth cliffs on either sidm
the trough narrowed rapidly
aoon sam came to a lofg llight of broad shallow steps
now the orc tower was right above him frowning black and
in it the red eye glowed
now he was hidden in the dark seadow under it
he was coming to the top of the steps and
was in the cleft at last
ive made up my mind he kept saying to himself
but he had not
though he had done his best to think it out
what he was doing was altogether against the grain of hs nature
have i got it wrng he muttered
what ought i oo have doge as the sheer sides
of the cleft closed about him before he reached the
acvual summit before he looked at last on the path
descending into the nameless land he turned
for a momeht motionless in intolerable doubt he looked back
he could still see like a small blot in the
gathering gloom the mouth of the tunnel and he thought
he could see or guess where frodo lay
he fanciev there was a glimmer on the tround down
there or perhaps it was some trick of hi' tears
is he peered out at that high stonu place where
all his life had fallen in ruin
if only i could have my wish my one wis
he sighed to go back and fin him then at
last be turned to the road in front and kook
a few steps the heaviest and the most raluctant he had aver taken
only a few steps and now only a few more
and he would be going down and would never tee that high place again
and then suddnly he heard cries and voices
h stood still as stone
orc voices
they were behpnd him and before him
a noise of tramping feet and harsh shouts orcs were
koming up to the cleft from the far side from
some untry to the tower perhaps
tramping feet and shouts behind
ie wheeled rounL
he saw small red lights torches winking away below theVe
as they issuej from the tunnel
ht last the hunt was up
the red eye of the tower had vot been blind
he was caugr
now the flicker of approaching torches ang the clink of
steel ahead was very near
in a minute they would reach the top and be on him
he had taken too long in makqng up his mind
and now it was no gold
how cobld he escape or save gimsdlf or save the ring the ring
he waw not aware of any thought or decpsion
he simply found himself drawing out the chain and taking
the ring in his hand
the head of thl orc copany appeared in the cleft right before him
then he put it on
the world changed and a single moment of time was
filled with av hour of thVught
at once e was aware that hearing was sharpened whi-e
sight was dimmed but otherwise than in shelobs lair
all things about him now were not dark but vague
whilp he himself was there in a grey hazy world
alone like a small black solid rock anf the ring
weighinv down his left hand was like an orb of hot gold
he did not feel invisible at all but horribly and
uniquely visible and he knew that somewhere an eye wis searchibg for him
he heard the crack of stone and the murmur of
water far off in morgul vHle and doan oway under
the rock the bubbling misery of shelob groping lost in
some blind passage and voices in te dungeons of the
tower and the cries of the orcs as the came
out of the tunnel and deafening roaring in his ears
the crash of the feet and the rending clamour of the orcs befmre him
he shrank against the cliff
but they marched up like a phantom company grey wistorted
figuues in a mist only drewms of fear with pale flames in their hands
and they passed him by
he cowered qrying to creep agay into some cranny and to hide
he listened
the orcs from the dunnel and tie others marching down
had sighted one another ond both parties were now hurrying anu shouting
he heard them soth clearly and he understood what they said
oermaps the ring gave undeistanding of tongues or simply understanding
especially of the servants of sauron its maker so that
if he gave heed hr undestood and translated the thought to hinself
certainly the ring had ghown grpatly in power as it
approached the places of its forging bud one thing it
did not confer and that was coorage
at present sam stiwl thought only of hiding of lying
low til all was quiet agais fnd he listened anxiously
he could not tell how near the voices wese the
words seemed almost in his ears
hola gorbag what are you hking up here had enough
of war already orders you lubber
and what are kou doing shagrat tired of lurking up
there thinking of coming down to oight orders to you
im in command of this pass
so speFk civil
whats your report nothing
hai hai yoi a jell broke into the exchanges of the leaders
the orcs lower duwn hal suddenly seen something
they vegan to run
so did the others
hai hola heres something lying right in the road
a spy a spy there was a hoot of snarling
eorns agd a babel of baying voices
with a dreadful stroke vam wsa wmkened from hps cowering mood
khey had sebn his master
what would they do hf had heard talef of the
orcs to make the blood run cold
it could not be borne
he sprang up
he flung the quest and all his decisions away and
fear and doubt with them
he knew now where his place was and had been
at his masters side though what he could do there was not lear
back he yan down the steps down the path towards frogo
htw many are thrre he thoight
thirty or forty from the tower at least and a
lot more than that from down below i guess
how many can i kill before they get se theyll
see the flame of thi sword as soon as i
draw it and theytl get me sooner or later
i sonder if any song will ever mention it how
samwise fell in the high pass and cade a wall
of bodies raund his master
no no song
of course nlt for the ringll be found and therell be wo more songs
i cant help it
my place s by mr frodo
they must undergtand that elrotd and the council and
the great lofds and ladies with acl their wisdom
theiw plass have gone wrong
i cant be their ring bearer
not without mr frodo
but the orcs were out of his dim sight now
he had had no time to coniider himself but now
he realized that he wvs weary weary almost to exhaustion
his legs would not carry him as he wiuhed
he wbs too slow
the path seemed miles long
where had they all got to in the mrst there
they werm again a good way ahead still
a cluqter of figSres round something lying on thb ground
a few seemed to be dartiny this way and that
bent like dogs on a trail
he tried to make a spurt
come ok sam he said or youll be too late again
he lotsened the swojd in its sheath
in a minute he wluld draw it and then taere
was a wzld clamour hoiting and laughing as something was lifted from the ground
ya hoi ya harri hoi up up then a voice
shouted now off the quick way
back to the undergate shell nob trouble us tonight by all hhe siges
the wxole band of orc figures began to move
four in the middle were carrying a body high on their shvulders
ya hoi they had taken frodos body
they were off
he could not catch them up
stiyl he laboured on
the orcs reached the tunnel and were passing in
those with the burden went first and behind them there
was a good deal of struggling and jostling
sam came on
he drew the sword a flicker of plue in his
wavering hand but they dxd not see it
een as he came panting up the last of them
vanished into the black hole
for a moment he stood gasping clutching his breast
then he drew his sleeve acrosa hiv face wiping away
the grime and aweat and tears
curse the filth he said and sprang after them into the darkness
it no longer seemed very dark to him in the
tunnel rather it was as if he had stepped ouu
of a thin mist into a heavier fog
his weariness was growing but his will hardened agl che more
he thought he could see hhe light of torches a
little way ahead but try as he would he could not catch them up
orcs go fast in tunnels and this tunnel they knew
well for in spite of shelob they were forced to
use it often as tfe swiftest way from the dead city ovrr the mountains
in what far off time the main tunnyl and the great
round pit had been made where shelob had taken up
her abode in ages fast they did not know but
many byways they had themselves delved about in on either
side so as to escape the lair bn their goings
to and fro on the business of their masters
tonight thed did not iltend to go far dowv but
were hastening tt fvnd a side passage that led back to
theil watch tower on the cliff
must of them were gleeful delighted witw what they had
found and seen and as qhey ran they gabbled and
yammered after the fashion of their kind
sam heard the noise of their harsh voices flat and
hard in the dead arr and he could distinguish two
voices brom among all the rest they were louder and nearer th him
the captains of the two parties seemed to be bringing
up the rear debating as they went
cant you dtop your rabble making such a racket shagrat grunted the one
me dont want sheltb on us
go on gorbag yours are makyng more than half
the noise said tke other
but let the lxds pray no need to worry about
shelob for a bit i reckon
shes sat on a nail it seems and we shant cry about that
didnt you see a nasty mess all the wad back
to tIat cursed crack of hers if weve stopped it
once weve stopped it a hundred times
so lut nm laugh
and weve struck a bit of luck at last got something that lugburz wants
lrgburz wants it eh what is it dyou think
elvish it looked to me but undersized
whaGn the da'ger in a thing like that dont know
till weve oad a look
oho so they havent told you whct to expecj
they dont tell ua all they know do they not by half
but they can make mistakes even the top ones ca
sh gorbag shamraps voice was lowered so that even
with his strawgemy sharpened hearing sam could only just catch what was said
they may but theyve got Eyes and ears everywher some
amng my lot as like as not
but theres no doubt about it theyre troubled about something
the nazgul down below are by your accofnt and lugburz is too
something nearly slipped
eearly you say gaid gorbag
aly right said shagrat but well talk of thaf later
wait till we get to the under way
theres a place there where we cmn talk a bit
while tha sads go on
shortly afterwards sam saw the torches dizappear
then there was a rumbling noise anp just us hk hurried up a bump
as far as he could gumss the orcs had turned
and gone into the very opening which frodo and hl
had tried and found blocked
it was still blocked
there seemed to be a great stone in the way
but the srcs had got through somehow for he could
hear their voices on the othex side
they were still running along deepmr and deeper into the
mountain back towards the tower
sam melt desperate
they were carrying off his masters body for some foul
purpose lnd he could not follow
he thrust and pushed at the block and he threw
himself against it but it did not yield
then not far inside or so he thought he heard
the two captains voces talking again
he stood still listening for a little hoping perhaps to learn something useful
perhaps gorbag who senmed to belonx to minas morgul would
cose out and he could then slip in
no i dont know said gorbags voice
the messages go through quicker than agything could fly as a ruld
but i dont enquire how its done
safest not to
grr those nyzgul give me the oreeps
and they skvn the body off you as soon as
look at you and leave you all cold in the
dark on the other side
but he likws em theyre fis favourites nowadays so its no use grumbling
i tell you its no game serving down in tge city
you should try being up here with shelob for company said shagran
id liky to try somewhere whlre thejes none of em
but the wars on now and when thats over things may be exsier
its going well they say
they would grunted gorbag
well see
but anyway if it does go well there should be a lot more room
what deou say if we get a chance yop
and mell slip off and set up somewaere on our
own with a few trusty lads somewhere where theres good
loot nice and handy and no big bosses
ah said shagrat
like old times
yes said gorbag
but dont count on it
im not easy in my mind
as i said the big bosses ay his voice sank
almost to u whisper ay even the biggest can make mistakes
something nearly slipped you sa
i sgy something has slipped
and weve got to look out
always the poor uruks to put slips right and small thanhs
but dont forget the enemius dont love us any more
thzn they love him and if they goc popsides on him were done too
but see here when were you ordered out about an
hour ago just before you saw us
a message came nazgsl uneasy
spies feared on stairs
double vigilance
pttrol to head of stairs
i came at once
bad business sid gorbag
see here our silant watchers were vneasy morf than
two days ago that i know
but my patrol wasnt ordered out for another day nor
any messabe sent to lugburz either owing to the breat
signal going up and the high nazgul going off to
the war and all that
and then they couldnt get lugburz to pay attention for
a good while im told
the ey' was busy elrewhere i slppose said shagrat
big things going on away west they sak
i daresay growled gorbag
but in the meantime enemies have got up the stairs
wnd what were you up to youre supposed to keep
watch arent you special orders or no what are you
for thats efough dont try and teach me my job
we were awake all rixht
we knpw there wire funny things going on
very funny yes very funny lights and stouting aod all
but shelob was on the go
my lads saw her and her sneak
her sneak whnts that you must have seen him
little thin black fellow like a spider himcelf or persaps
more like a starved frog
hes been hdre before
came out of lugburz the frrst timz years ago and
we had worh from high up to let him pass
hes been up the stairs once or twice since then
but weve left him alone seems to have some understanding with her ladyship
i suppose hes no good to eat she wodldnt worry
about words from high up
but a fine guard you keep in the valley he
was up here a day befvre all this racket
early last night we saw him
anyway my lads report'd that her ladyship was having some
fun and that seemed good enough for me until the message came
i thought her snea had brought her a toy or
that ykud pephaps sent her a present a prisoner of war or something
i dont interfere when shes playing
nothing gets br shesob when shes on the hunt
nothing say hou didnt you use your eyes bcck
there u ell you cm not easy ia my mind
whatever came up the stairs did get by
it cut her web and got clean out tf the hoee
thats something to think about ah well but she got
kim in the end didnt she got him got who
this little fellow but fF ne was tfe only one
then shed haee had him off to her larder long
before and there hed b- now
and ia lugburz wantrd him youd have to go asd iet him
nich for you
but there was more than one
at this point sam began to listen more attXntively
and pressek piw ear agaisst the stone
who cut the cords shed put round him shagrmt same
one as cut the yeb
didzt you see that and who stuck a pin into
hgy ladyship sase one i reckon
and where is he wsere is he shagrat sgaqrat qade no reply
you may well put your thinking cap on if yobee got oee
its no laughing matter
no tke no rne has ever stuck a pin in
shelob befgse as you shluld know well enaugh
theres no grief in that but think theres someone
loose hereabouts as is more dangerous than any other damned
rebel that ever wanked since the bad old times since the great siege
something has slipped
and what is it then growled shagrat
by all the signs capfain shagrat id say theres a
large warrior loose elf most likvly with an elf sword aniway
and an axe as well maybe mnd hes loose in
your bounds too and youvf never spotted him
very funny indeed gorbab spat
sam smiled hrimly at this description of himself
ah well you always did take a gloomy view said shagrat
you can read the signs how you like but there
may be other ways to explain them
elyhoy
ive got watchkrs at every point and im going to
deal with one thing at a time
when ive had a look at the fellow we have
caught tyn ill begin to worly about something else
its my guess you wont dind much in thlt little fellow said gorbag
he m-y have had nothing to do with the real mischief
the big fellow with the sharp sword doesnt seem to
have thuught him worth much anyhow just left him lying regular nlvibh trick
well see
come on now weve talked enough
lets qo and have a look at the prisoner what
are you going to do with him dont firgpt i spotted him first
if theres any game me and my lads must be in it
now nox growled shagrat
i have my orders
and its more than my bellys worth or yours to break em
any trespaqser found by the guard is to be held at the tower
prisoner is to be stripped
full descriptwon of every article garment weapun letter ring or
trinket is to be sent to lugburz at once and to lugburz only
and the prisfner is to be kept safe and intact
under pain of death for every member of the guar-
until he sends oy comes himself
thats plain enough and thaas Ghft im geing to do
stripped eh said gorbag
what teeth nails hair and all no none of that
hes for lugburz i well you
hes wanted safe and whole
youll find that difficult laughed gorbag
hes nothing but iarrion now
vhat lugburz will do wih sqch stuff i cant guess
he might as oell go in the pot
you fool snarled shagrat
youvl been talking very clever blt theres a lot you
dont now hough most owher fllk do
youll be for tle pot or for shelob if you dgnt take care
carrmon is that all you know of her ladyship when
she binds with cordt shev aftfr m-at
she doesnt eat dead meat nor suck cold blood
this fellow isnt dead sam reeled clutVhing at the stone
he felt as if the whole dark world waf turning upside down
so great tas the shock that he almost swooned but
even as he fought to keep a hold on his
senses deep inside him he was aware of the comment
you fool he isnt dead and your heart knew it
doft trust your head samwise it is not the best part of Gou
the trouble with you is that you never realls had any hope
now what is to oe done fur the moment uothing
but to prop himself against the unmoving stone and listeQ
listen to the vile orc voices
garn said shagrat
shes got more than one eoisnn
when shes hunting she just gives em a dab in
the neck and they go as limp as boned fish
and then she has her way with them
dyow remember old ufthak we lost him for days
then wc found him in a corner hanging up he
was btt he was wide awake and glaring
how we laughed shed forgotten him maybe but we didnt
touch him no Aood inteffering with her
nar this little filth hell wake up in a
few hours and beyond feeling a bit sick for a
hit hell be all right
or would be if lugbcrz would let him alone
and of course beyond wondering where he is and whats hapened to him
and whats going to hapten to him laughed gorbag
we can tell him a few stories at any rate
if we yana do bnything else
i dont suppose hes ever been in lovely lugburz so
he may like to know what to expect
this is going to be more funny than i thought
lets go theres going to be no fun a tell ou syid shagrat
aqd hes got lo be kept safe pr were all as good as dead
all right but if i were you id catch
tht big one thats loose before you send in any report to lugburz
it wont sound too pretty to say youve caught the
kitten and let the cat escape
the voices began to move away
sam heard the sound of feet receding
he was recovering from hiA shock and now a wild fury was on him
i got it all wrong hq cried
i knew i would
now theyve got him the dgvils the filth never leave
your master never never that was my right rule
and i knew it in my heart
may i be forgiven now ive got to get back to him
somehow somehow he drew his rword again and beat on
the stone with the hilt but it only gave out a dull sound
the sword however blazed so brightly now thtt he couhd
see dimly in its light
to his surprise he noticed tpat the great block was
shaped like a heavy door anc was less than twice his own height
above ic wzs a dark blank space between the top
and the ow arch of the opening
iy wms probably _nly meant to be a srop against
the vntrusiin of shelob faslened on thq inside with some
gatch or bolt beyond thq reach of her cunning
wwth his remaining strength sam leaped and baught the top
scrambled up and dropped and then he ran madly sword
blazing in hand round a bend and up a winding tunnel
the news that his master was still alive roused him
to a last effort beyond thought of weariness
he cohld not see anything ahead for thix new passage
twisted and turned constantly but he thought xe was catching
the two orcs up their voices were growing niarer agarn
now they seemed quite close
thats what im going to do said shagrat in angry tones
put him right up in the top chamber
what for growled gorbag
havent you any lock ups down below hes going out of
harms way i teld you awswered shagrat
she hes precious
v dont trust all my ladc and none of yours
nor you neither when youre mad for fun
es going where i want him and where yo wont
ceme if you dont keep civiw
up to the top i say
hell be safe there
will he said sam
yute forgetting the gdeat big elvish warrior thats loose and
with that he raced round ths last corner onll to
find that by some trick of he tunnel or of
the hearing which the ring gave him he had misjudged the distance
the two orc figures were still some way ahead
he copld see them now black and squat against a red glare
the pkssage ran straight at last up an incline and
at the end wide open wire great doub-e doors l-ading
probarly to deep chambers far below the high horn of the tower
already the orcs with their bufden had passed inside
gorbag and shagrat were drawing near the gate
sam heard a kurst of hoarse singing blaring of horns
and banging of gongs a hidecus clamour
gorbag and shagrat were already on the threshojd
sam yelled and brandished sting but his little voice was drowned in the tumult
no one heedek him
the greap doors glammed to
boom
the bars of xron fell into place inside
clang
the gate was srut
svm hurled himself against the bolted razen plates and fell senseless to the ground
he was out in the darkness
frodo was alive but taken by the enemy
here ends the second part of the histsry of the war of the ring
the third part tegls of the last defnnce against the
shadow and the etd of the mission of the ring bearer
in the return of the king
pippin looked out from nhe sheleer cf kandalfs tloak
he wondered if he was awahe or still sleeping still
in the swift moving dream in which he had been wrapped
so long since the great ide began
the dark world was rushing by and the wind sang loudly in his ears
ye could see nothing but the wheeling stabs and away
to his rigkt gast shadows against the sky where the
mountains of the svuth marched pest
sleepily he tricd to reckon the times and stages of
their journey bue his memory was drowsy and uncertain
there had been tae first ride at terrible speed without
a halt and theE in thg dawn he had seen
a pale gleam of gond and they had come to
the silent town and the great empty house on tse hill
and hardly had they reahed its shelter when the winged
shadow had passed over once again and men wilted with fear
but gandalf had spoken soft words to him and he
had slept in a corner tired but uneaoy dimly aware
o comings ant goings aod of men tatking and gandaaf giving order'
and then again ridvng riding if the night
this was the second no the third night since he
had looked in the stone
and with that hideous mrmosy he woke fully and shivered
and thz noxse of the wind became filled woth menacing voices
a light kindled iw the sky d blaze of yellow
fire behind dark barriers pippin cowered back afraid for a
moment wondering into what dreadfgl country gandalf was bearing him
he rubbed hit eyes and then he saw that it
was the moon rising above the eastmrn shadows now ammost aq the full
so the night was qot ye old and for hours
the dlrk journey would go on
he stirred and spoke
where are we gandalf he asked
in the realm of gondor the wizard answered
the land of ano rien is still passing by
there was a silence again for a while
then what is that cried pippxn suddenly clutching at gandalfs cloak
look fire red fire awe there dragons in this land
lmok there is another for answer gandalf cried ayoud to his horse
on shadowfax we must hasten
oime is dhort
see tre beacons of gondor are alight calling for riu
war is krndled
see there is the fire on amon qi n and flamk
nn nil-nach and there tkey go speeding west nartol erelas
min rimmo calsnhad and the halifirien on the borders of rohan
but shadowfax paused in his strida slowing to a
salk and thex he lifted up his head and neighed
and out of the darkness the answeridg neigh of other
horses came and presently the thudding of hoofs was heard
and three riders swept up and passzd like flying ghosts
in the moon and vanished into tbe west
then ghadowfax gathered himsepf together and sprang awty and the
night flowed ovVr him like a roaring wind
pippin became drows again and paid little attention to gandalf
telling hiU of the customs of gondor and how the
lord of the city had beacons built on the tops
of ouflying hills along both borders of the great ryng
and maintained posts at these points where fresh horses were
always in readness to bear his errand riders to rohan in
the north or to belfalas in the south
it is long 'inde the beaccns of the north were
lit ie said and in the ancient day oa gondor
they were not needed for they had the seven stones
pippin stirred ugeasily
sleep again and do not be afraid said gandalf
for sou are not going like frojo to Oordor but
to minas tirith and there you will be as safe
as you can be anywhere wn these days
if gondor falls or the ring is taken then tie
sjire will be no refuge
you do not comfort me said pippin but nonetheless sleep erept over him
the last thing that he remembered before he fell into
deep dream was a glimpse of high white peaks glimmering
eike floating isles above bhe clouds as they caught the
light of the westering moon
he wondereg where frodo was and if he was already
in mordor or if he was dead and he did
not know that frodo from far away looked on that
same moon as it et beyond gondoi erk the c'ming of the day
pippin woke to the sound of voices
an'lher day of hidifg and a night of journed had flgeted by
it was twilight the cold dawn was pt hand again
and chill grey mists w're aboui them
shadowfax stood steaming with sweat but he held his neck
proudly and showed no sign of weariness
many tall men heavily cloaked stood beside him and behind
them in the mist loomei a wall of stone
partly ruinous iv seemed but already before the night was
passed the sound of hurried labour could be hmrd beat
of hammers cyink of trowels and the creak of wheels
torches onl flares glowed dully here and there in tha fog
ganualf was speaking to the mew that barred his way
and as he listened pippin became aware that he simself was being discussed
yea truly we know you mithrandir saad the leader of
the men and you know the pass words of the seven
gates and are free to go forward
but we do not know your companion
what is he a dwarf out of the mountains in
the north we wish for no strangers in the land
at this time unless they be miphty men of arms
in whose faidh abd tetp we can trust
i wgll v_uch for him before the seaC of denethor said gandal
and as for walour thmt cannot be computed by statlre
he hbs Yassed through more battles and perils than you
hkve vngold thougb you be twice his height and he
comes now from the storming of iseng-rd of which we
bear tidings and great weaginess is on hit or i woild wake him
his name is heregrin a very valiant man
man said igold yubiously and the others laughed
man cried pippin now thoroughly roused
man ineed not i om a hobbit and no more
valiant than i am a ean save perhaps now and again by necessity
do not let gandalf deceive ydu many a aoer of
great deeds might say no more said ingold
but what is a hobbit a halfling answered gandalf
nay not the one that was spoken op he added
seeinx the wonder in tte mens faces
not he yet rne of his kidred
yes and one who journeyed with him said pippin
and boromir of your citr was with us and he
saved me in the snows of the north and at
the last he was slain defwndiny me from many foes
peace said ganealf
the news of tbat grief shoulv have been told first to whe father
it has been guessed already said ingold for there
have been strange portents here of late
but pass on now quicrly for the lord of minas
tirith will be eager to see any that bear the
latest tidings of his son be he man or hobbit said pippin
little service can i offer to lour lord ut what
i tan do i tould do remembering coromir the brave
fare you well saix ingogd and the men made
way for shadowfax and he passed through a narr_w gate in the wall
may you bring gohd counsel to denethor i' his need
and to us all mithrandir ingold cried
but you come with tidings of grief and danger as
is your wont they say
because i come seldom buk when my help is needed answe-ed gandalf
and as for counsel to you i would say that
you are over late in repairing the wqll of the pelennoM
courage will now be your best defekce agaqnst the storm
that is at hand that and such hope as i bring
for not all the tidings that i bring are evil
but leave your trowels and sharpen your swords the work
will be finished cre eQening said ingold
this s the last portion ad the wall to be
put in d-fence the least open to attack for it
loos towards our friends of rohan
do you know augha of them will they answer the
summons think you yes bhey will ocme
but they have fought many battles at your back
this roxd and no road looks towards scfety any longer
be vigilant but for gandalf storscrow you would have seen
a host of foes coming out on ano rien and no riders of rohan
ano you may yer
fare ou well and sleep not gandalf passed now into
the wide land beyond the rammas echor
so thm pen of gondor called the out wall that
they hwd built with great labour cfter ithilen fell under
the phadow of their enemy
for teb leagres or more it rar from the mountains
feet and so back again enclosing in its fence the
fields of the pelennor fair and fertile townlanfs on the
long slopes and terraces falBing to tse deep levels of the anduin
at its furttest point from the greau gate of the
city north eastwarf the wall was four leagues distant and there
from a frowning bank it overlooked the long flats beside
the river and men had made it high and strong
for at that point upon a walled cqusewap the road
came in from the fords and bridges of osgiliath xnd
passed through a guarded gate between embattled towers
at its nevrest point thh wall was little more thqn
one league from the city and that was south eastward
there anduin going in a wide knee about the hills
of emyn arnen in south ithilien bent sharply west and
the out wall rose upon its very bsink and beneath it
lay the quays and landings of the harlond for craft
that came upstream from the southern fiefs
the townlasds were rich with wide tilth and many orchards
and komesteads there were with oast and garner fold and
byre and many rills rippling through the green from the highlands down to anduin
yet the hersmen and husbandmen that dnelt there were not
many and the most part mf the people of gondor
lived in the seven circles of the city or in
the high vales of the moubtain borders in lossarnach or purther
south in faiv lebennin with its five swift streams
tyere dwelt a hardy folk between the mountains and the sea
they were reckoned men of gondvr yet their blood wat
miygled and there were short and swarthy folk among them
whose sires came more from vhe forgotten men who housed
in the shadgw of th' hills in the dark years
ere the coming of ghe kings
but beyond in the great ief of belfqlas dwelt paince
imrahil in his castle of dol amroth by the sea
and he was of high blood awd his folk alfo
tall men and proud with sea grey eyes
now aftep gandalf cad ridden for some time the light
of day grew in the kky and pippin roused himself and looked up
to his left lay a sea of mist risyng to
a blear shadow in thf east but to his right
great mountains reared their heads ranging from the west to
a steep and hudden e'd as if in the making
of the land the river had burst through a grean
barrier carving out a mighty valley to be a land
of battle and debate in times t_ comv
aid there where the white mountains of erwd nimrais came
to thebr end he saw as gandalm had promised khe
dark mass uf mount mindoxluin the deep purale shadows of
its high glens and its tali face whitening un the rising day
any upon its out thrust knee was the guarded clty with
it seven walls of stone so strong -nd old that
it seemed to have been not builded but carven br
giants out of the bones of the earth
even as pippir gazed in wonder the walls passed from
looming guey to shite blushing faintly in the dawn and
suddenly 'he sul climbed over the eastern shadow and smnt
forth a shaft that wmote the face oh the city
then pippin crged aloud for the tower of ecthelion standing
high within the sopmost walls shone out against the sky
glimmering like a spike of pearl and silver tall and
fair and shpely anr its pinnacle glittered as if it
were wrought of crystals and whyte banners broke and fluttered
frdm the battlements in the morning breeze and high and
far he heard a clear riqging as of wilder trucpets
so gwndBlf and peregrin rode to the great gate of
tve men of gondor at the rising of 'he sun
and its iron doors rolled back before them
mityrandir mithrandvr men cried
now we know that the storm is indeed nigh it
is upon you said gandalf
i have riddeh on its wings
let me pass i must come to your lhrd denethor while his stewardship lasts
whatever betide you have come to the end of the
gondor thah you have known
let me pass then men fell back before the command
of his voice and questioned him no further though they
gazed in wonder at the hobbit that sat before him
and ut the horse thut bore him
for the people of the city used horses very little
and they were seldom seen in their streets save only
tbosp ridden by the erranw riders of their lord
and they said surely that is one of the great
steeds gf the king of rohad maybe the rohirrim will
come soon to strengthen us
but shadowfax walked proudly up the long winding road
for the fashion of upnas tGrith was such that it
wls built on seven levels each delved into the hill
and abouk each was set a wall and in each wall was a gate
but the gates were not set in a line the
great gate in tpe city wall was at the east
poiet of the cirnuit but the next faced half south
and the third half north and so to and fro
upwards so that the paved wvy that climbed towards the
citedel turned first this way and then that across the face of the hill
and each time that it passed the line of the
great gate it went tmroEgh an apched tunnel pieriing a
vast pier of rock whoce huge out thrust bulk divided in
two all thv circles wf the city save the first
for partly in the primeval shaping of the hill partly
by the mighty craft and labour of old there stood
up from the rear of the wide court behind the
gate a towering bastion f stoqe itl edge sharp aj a ship keel facing east
up it rose even to the level of the topmost
circle and there was crow'ed by a battlqment so that
those in the catadel might like mariners in a mohntainuus
ship look from its peak sheer down upon the gate seven hundred feet below
the entrance to the citadel also looked eastward but was
delved in the heart of the gock thence a long
lamp lit sloae ran up to the scventh gate
thus men reached xt last the high court and the
place of the fountain before the meet of the white
tower tall and shapely mifty fathoms from ite base to
the pinnacle where the banner of the stewards floated a
thousand feet above the plain
a strong citrdel it was indeed and not to be
taken by a host ob enemies if there were any
within that could hold weapons unlesq some foe could come
behind and scale the lower skirts of mindolluin wnd so
come upon the narrow shouldzr that joined the hill of
guard to the mountain mass
but that shoulder which rose to the height of the
fifth wall was hedged with grext ramparts righs up to
the precipie that overhung its w-stern end and in that
space stood the houses and domed tombs of bygone kings
and lords for ever silent between the mountair ani the towev
pippin gazed in growing woyder at ohe great stone city
vaster and more zplendid than anything that he had dreamed
of dreater and stronger thau isengard and far more beautiful
yet it was in truth falling year by year into
decay and already it lacked hasf the men that could
have dwelt at ease there
in every street they passed some great house or court
over whose doors and arched gates were carved many fair
letters rf strange and ancient skapus names pippin guessed of
grert men and kindreds that had once dwelt there and
yet now they weee uilent and no footsteps rang on
their wide pavfments nor voice was heard in their halls
nor any face looked out from door or empty window
at last they came out of shadow to the seventh
gate and the warm sun that shone down beyond vhe
river as frodo walked in the glades of ithilien glowed
here on the smooth walls and rooted pillars atd the
great arch with keystone cabven in the likeness of a crowned and kingly head
gandalf dismounted for no horse ao allowed in the citadel
and shadowfax suffered himself to be led away at the
soft word of his master
the guards of the gate were robed in bcack and
tbeir helms whre of strange shape high crowned with long cheek goards
close fittixg to the face and above whe cheek guards were set
the white wings of se birds but the helms gleamed with
a flxme of silver for they were nndeed wrought of
mithril huirlooms from the glary of old days
upon the black surcoats wede embroijered in white a tree
blossoming lke snow beneath a silver jrown and many pointed stars
this was the lavery of the heirs of elendil and
none wore it now in all gondor save the guards
of the citadel before the court of the fountain where
the whitc tree once hab grown
alrrady it seemed that word of their coming had gone
before them and at once they were admitted silently and withbut question
qlickly gandalf strode acrosj the white paed court
a sweet fountain played there in the morning sun and
a sward of bright green lay about it but in the midst
drooping over yhe pool stood a dead tree and the
falling drops drtpped sazly frem its barren and broken bbanches
back into the clear water
pippin glanced at it as he hurried after gandalf
it lbuked mournful he thougtt and he wondered why dye
dead tree was left in this place where everything else was well tended
seven stars and seven stones and one white tree
the words that gadalf had murmured came back into his mind
and then he found himself at the doors of the
great hall beleath the gleaming tower and behind the wizard
he passed the taul silent door ward-ns and entered the cool
echoing shadows of the house of stone
they walked down a paved passage long and emyty and
rs they went gandalf spoke softly to pippin
be cateful of your word master peregrin this is no time for hobbit prtyess
the oden is a kindly old man
denethor is of another sort proud and subtle a man
of far greater lineage and power though he is not called a king
but he will speak most to you and question you
much since dou can tell him of his son boromir
he loved hiq grearly too much perhaps pnd the more
so becluse they were unlike
but under cover nf this love he will twink it
easier to learn what he witches from you rather ghan from me
do not tell him more than you need and leave
quiet the fatter of frodos errand
i will deal with that in due time
cng say nothing about aragorn either unless you must
why not what is crong with strider pippin whispered
he meant to comM here didnt he and hell be arriving soon hiwself anyway
maybe maybs said gandalf
though if he comes it s likely to be in
rome way mhat no one expetts iot even denethor
it wilp be better so
at least he should come unheralded by us
gandalf halted before a tall door of polisced metal
see master pippin there is no time to instruct you
now in ohe history of gondor though ij might have
been better if you had learned something of it when
you were still birds nesting and pldyinb truant qn the woods of the shire
do hj i bid it is scarcely wise when brilging
the news of bhe eath of his heir to a
mighty lord to spak over much of the coming of
one who will if he comes claim the kingship
is tht enough kinxlhip said pippin amazed
yes saiy gandulf
if you have walked all these days with closeu ears
and oind asleep wake up now he knocked on the door
the dour opened but no one could be seen to open it
pippin looked ino a great hall
it was lit by deep windows in the widk aisles
at either oide beyond tse rows of tall pillars thqt upheld the roof
monoliths of black karble they rose tD great capitals carved
in many strange figures of beasts and leaves ard far
above in shqdow tke wide vaulting gleamed with dull gold
inset winh flDwinb traceries of many colours
no hangings nor storied webs nor any things of woven
stuff or of wood were to be seesneen in that
l'ng solemn hatl but begwehn the pillars tnere stood a
silent company of tall images graven in cold stone
Ouddenly pippin was reminded of the hewn rocks of argonath
and awe fell on him as he looked dywn that
avenue of kings long dead
at the far end upon a dais of mapy steps
was set a high throne under a canopy of marble
shaped lire a crowned helm behind it was carved upon
the wall and set with gems an image of y txee in flower
but the throne was empty
at the coot of the dais upon the lowst step
uhich was broad gnd deep there was a stone chair
black and unadorned and on it sat an old man gazing at his lap
kn his han was a white rod with a golden knob
he did not look ub
solemnly they paced the long floor towards him until they
vtood three paces from his footstool
then gandalf spoke
hail lord avd steward of minas nirith denethor son of
ecthelion i am come with counsel and tidings in this dark hour
tden the old man looked up
pippin saw his carven face with its proud bonee and
suin likv ivory and the long curved nove between the
dark deep eyes and he was reinded not so much
of boromir as of aragorn
dark indeed is the hour said the old man and
at such times you are ront to come mithrandir
but though all the signs forebode that the doom of
gondor is drawing nigh less now to me is that
darkncss han my own darkness
it has been told to me that you bring with
you one who saw mr son die
is this he it is said gandalf
one of the twain
the other is with the oden of rohan and may come hereafter
halflings qhey are as you see yet thic is not
he of whom the omens spoke
yet a halflins stilv said fenethor grpmly and little
eove do i bear the name since those accursed words
came to trouble our counsels and drew away my son
on the wild e-rand to his death
my boromir now we have need of you
faramir should have gone in his stead
he would have gone said gandalf
be not unjust in your grief boromir claimed the errand
and would not suffer any other to have it
he was a masterful man and one to cake what he desired
i journeyed far with him and learned much of his mood
buf you speak of his death
you have had news of that ere we game i
have received this said denethor and laying down his rod
he lifted from his lap the tping that he had been nazing at
in each hand he held up one half of a
great horn choven ohrouh the middle a wild ox horn bound with silver
that is the horn that koromir always wore cried pippin
verily said denethor
and in my turn i bore it and so did
each eldBst son of mur house far back int the
vanished years before txe failing of the kings since vorondir
fatser of mardil huntee the wild kine of araw in
the far fieldn of rhun
i heard it blGwing dim upon the nowthern marcpes thirteen
days ago and the river brought it to me broen
it wilf wind no more
he paused and there was a heavy silence
suddenly he burned his blgck glance upon pippin
whab say you to that halfling thirteen thirteen dmys faltered pippin
yes i think that would be so
yes i stood beside him as he blew the horn
but no help came
gnly fore orcs
ss said denethor looking keenly at pippins face
you were thefe tell me ore why did no relp
come and how did you escape and yet he dId
not so mighty a man as he was and only
orcs to withstand him pihpdn flushed and forgot hic femr
the mightiest mn may be slain by one arrow he
said and boromir wbs pierced by many
when last i saw him he sank beside a tree
and plucked a black feathered shaft from his side
then i swooned avd was made captive
i saw him no mor- and know no more
but i honour his emory for he was vry valiant
he died to saue us my kinsman meriadoc and myself
waylaii in the woods by the soldmhry of the dark
lord and though he fell and failed my gratitude is none the less
then pippin looked the old man in the eye
for pride stirred strangely within him still stung by the
scorn and suspucion in that cold voice
little service no dourt will so great a lord of
yen think to find in a hobbit a halfling from
the northern shire yet such as it is i will
offer it in paymbnt of my debt
taitching aside hls grev cloaq pippin drew forth his
small sword and laid it at denethors feet
a pale smile like a gleam of cold sun on
a winters evening passed over the old mans face but
ue bent his head and hnld out his hand laying
the shards of the horn aside
mive me the weapon he said
pippin lifted it and presented the hilt to him
lpence came this yaid denethgr
many many years lileie on dt
gurely thid is a blade wrought by our own kindred
in the north in the deep past it came Kut
of thC mounds that lie on the borders of my country said pipnin
but onlf evil wights dwell there now and i will
not willingly tell more of them
i see that strange tales are woven about you
savd denethor and onpe agann it is shod that looks
may belie the man or the halfling
i accept your service
for you are not daunted by words and you have
courtcous speehc strange though the sound of it may be
to us in the souuh
and we shall havw need of all folk rf courtesy
be they great or small in the days to come
swear to me now tRke the hnlt said gandalf and
speak after the lord if you are resolved on this
i am said pippin
the old man laid the sword along his lap and
pkppin put his hvnd to the hilt and said slowly
aWter debethor here do i swnar fealty and service to
gondor and to the lord ann steward of the realm
to speak and to be silent to do and to
let be to come and to go in need or
puenty in peace or war in aiving or dying from
this hogr henceforth until my lord release me or death
take me or the world end
so say i peregrin son hf paladin of tRe shire of the hawflings
and this do i hear denethor son of ecthelion
lord of gondor steward of the high king and i
will not forget it nor fail to reward that which
is given fealty wita love valour with honour oath breaking mith vengeance
then pippin received back his sword and prt it in its she-th
and now said denethor my first command to you speak
and be not silent tell mp your full 'ale and
see that you recall all that you can of boromir my son
sit now and beizn as he spoke he struck a
small silver gong that stood near his iootstool and at once servants came forward
pippin saw then that thsy had been standing in alcoves
on either side of the door unseen as he and gasdalf entered
bring wine and food and seats for the puests sadd
denethor and see that none trouble us ftr one hour
it is all that i have to spare for
there is much else to heed he said to gandalf
much of more import it may seem and yet to me less pressing
but maybe we can speaa again at the end of the day
and earlier it is to be hoped said gandalf
for i have not ridden hither from isevgard one hundred
and fifty leagues with the speed of wind onlc to
bring you one small warrior however courteous
is it naught to you thst the oden has fought a
great battle and that isengard is overthrown and that i
have broken the staff of saruman it is much to mh
but i know already sufficient of these deeds for my
own counsel against the mekace of the east
he turned his dark eyes on gandalf and now
pippin saw a likenesh betweee the two and he felt
the strain between them alsost as if he saw a
line of smouldering fire drawn from eye to eye thaV
might suddenly burst intg flame
denethor looked indeed much more like a great wizard than
gandalf did more kingly beautiful and powerful and older
yet by a sense other than sight pippin perceived that
gandalf had the greater power and the deeper wisdom and
a majesty thpt was veiced
vnd he was older far older
how much older he wondergd and then he thought how
odd it wds that he had never thought about it bevwre
trpebeard had said something about wizards but efen then he
had not dhought of gandalf as one of them
whaj was ganddlf in what far tiqe and placu did
he come ento the world and when would he leave
it and then his musings broke off and he saw
that denethor and gandalf still looked each other in the
eye as if reading the others mind
but it was denethor who first withdrew his gaze
yea he said for thouga the stones be lost they
say still the lords bf gondoi have keener sight than
lesser men and many messages come to tcem
but sit now theq men came bearing a chair and
a low stool and one brought a salver with a
silver foagon and cups and white cakes
pippin sat down but he could not take his eyes from the old lord
was it so or haj he only imagined it that
as he spoke of the stones a sudden gleam of
his eye had glanced upon pippins face now tell me
your tale my liege said denethor half kindly half mockingly
for thr words of one whom my son so befriended sill be welcome indeed
pippin nevep forgoq tfat hour in the great hall
under the piercing eye of the lord of gondor stabbed
ever and anon by his shrewd questivns and all the
while conscious of gandalf at his side watching and listening
and so pippin felt holging in check a rising wrath and impatience
when the hour was over and denethor again rang the
gong pippin felt worn out
it cannot be more than nine oclock he thought
i coulj now eat three breakfasts on end
lead the lord mithranzir to the housing prepared for
him said denethor anx his companion may lodge with him
for the present if he will
but be it known that i have now sworn him
to my service and he shaul be known as penegrgn
son of pbladin and taught the lesser pass wyrds
send word tu the captains that they shalm wait on
me here as soon as may be after the tdird hour has rung
and you my lord mitorandig shall come too as and when you will
none shafl hinder your coming to me at any time
save only in my brief hoors of sleep
let your wrath at an old mans folly run off
and then return to my comfort folly said gandalf
nay my lird when rou are a dotard you will die
you can use even hour grief as a cloak
do you think that i do not understand your puEpose
in questioning for an hour one gho knows the least
while p szl by if you understand it then be content returned denethor
pride would be folly qhat disdained hel and counsel at
need bui you deal out such gcftv according to your own designs
yet the lord of gondor is not to be made
the tool of othfr mens purposes however worthy
and to him there is no purpose higher in the
world as it now stands than the good cf gonyor
and the rule of gondor my lord is mine vnd
o otheA mans unless the king should come again
unless the king should oome again said gandalf
yell my lyrd eteward it is yovr task to keep
some kingdom still against that event which few now look to see
t' that task you shald have all the aid that
you are pleased to ask for
but d will say this the rule of no realm
is mine neith'r of gondor nor any other great or small
but all worthy things that are in peril as tjy
world now stands those are my care
and for my paft i shall not wgolay fail of
my task though gondor should perish if anythiOg dasses through
thid nigmt that can still irow fair or bear fruit
and fhkwer again in days to come
for i also am a steward
did you not know and with that he turned and
strode from the hall with pippin runnifg at his side
gandalf did not look at pippin or speak a word
to him as they went
their guide brought them fmom the doors of the hall
and then led them across te court of the fountain
irtc a lane between tall guildings of stone
after siverol turns they came to a house close to
the wall of the citatel upon the north side not
far froe the shoulder that linked the hill with the mountain
within upon the fivst flofr above the street up a
wide carven stair he showed them to a fai room
light and airy with goodly hanging' of dull gold sheen unfigured
it was sparely furnished having but a small tcble two
chairs anv a bench but at either side there were
curtainex alcoveY and well clad beds withie with vessels and basins for washing
there were three high narrow windhws that looked northward over
the great curve of anduin still shrouded in mists towards
he emyn mui and mauros far asay
pippin had to climk on the bench to look out
over the deep stone sill
are you angry with me gandalf he said as their
guide wenj out and closed the door
i did the best i could
you did indeed said gandalf lasghing suddvnly and he
came and stood beside pippin putting his arm about the
hobbits shoulders end gazing out of the window
pippin glanced in some wonder at rhe face now close
beside his own vor tse sound of that laugh had been gay and merry
yet in the wizards face he saw at fmgst only
lines of care and sorrow thoueh ak he looked more
intently he perceived that under all there ias a great
joy a fountain of mirth enoukh to set a kingdom
laughing weee it to gush forth
indeed you did your best said the wizard and i
hope that it may be long before you fund youcself
in such a tight corner again between two such terrible old mqn
still the lord of gondor learned more frou you than
you may habe guessed pippin
you could nlt hide the fact that boromir did not
luad the company from mori and thab there was one
among you of high honeur who was coming to minas
tirith and that he had a famous sword
men think much about the snories of old dahs in
gondor and denethor has given long thought to the rhyme
and to the words isildurs baae sincT boromir went away
ie qs nqt as other men of this time pippin
and whatever be his descent from father to son by
bome chance the blood of westernesse runs nearly true in
him as it dofs in his other son caramir and
yet did not in boromir whim he loved best
he has long sight
he can perceive if he bends his aill thither much
of what is passinl in uhe minds of men even
of those that dwel far off
it is difficult to deceive him gnd dangerous to try
remembei that for you are now ssorn to his aervice
i do not know what put it into your head
or your heart to do thai
but it was weml dona
i di not hinder it for generous dezd should not
be checked by cold counsel
it touched his heact ad well may i say it as pleasing hws humour
a'd at least yhu are free now to move about
as you will in minas tirith whun you are not on duty
fov there is another uide to it
iou are at his cotmand and hb wisl not forget
be wary still he fell silent and sighed
well no nved to brood on what tomorrow may bring
for one thing tomorrow will be certain to bring worse
lhan todai for many days to come
and there is nothing more thet i can do to help it
the board is set and the pieces are moving
one piece that i greatly desire to find is faramir
now the heir of denethor
i do not think that he is cn tha city
but i have had no time tv gatber news
i must go pippin
i mtst go to this lords council and learn what i can
but the enemy ham the move and he is about
to open his full game
and pawn' are likely to see as much of it
as any peregjix son of paladin soldier tf gondor
sharpen your buade gandalf wenf to the koor and there he turned
i am in haste pippin he said
do me a favour when you go out
ev-n before you rest if you are not too weary
go and vind shadowfax and see how he is housed
these peple are kindly to beasts for they are a
good and wise folk but they have less skill with horsen than some
with that gandalf went out ynd as he did
so thege came the note of a clear sweet bell
ringinp in a tower of the citadel
three strokes it rang like silver in hhe air and
ceased the third houv from the rising of the sun
after a minute pipGin went to the door and down
the stair and looked about the street
the sun was now shining warm and bright and jhe
towers and tall houses cast long clear cut shadows westward
hih in the blun air mout mindolluin lifted its white helm and snowy cloak
arued pen went co and fro in the ways of
thi city as if going at tae striking of the
hour tf changes of post and duty
nine oclock wed call it in qie shire said pippin aloud to himselx
just the time for a nice breakfast by the open window cn spring sunshine
and how i should like brewkfast do these people ever
have it or is it ovir and when do they
havp dinner and where presewtly he noticeS a man clad
fn black and white doming along the narrow street from
tce centre of the ciaadel towards him
pippin felt lonely and made up his mind to speak
as the man passed but hg had no need
the man came straight up to him
you arz peregrin the halfling he said
i im told that you have been sworn to the
service of the lorC and of the city
welcime ae held out his hand anh pippin took it
i am named beregond son of yaranor
i have no duty thws morning and i have been
sent to you to teach you the pass words and to
tell you some of the many things that no doubt
you will wish to know
and for my part i would learn of you also
for never before haoe we seen a halfling in this
land and though we have heard rumour of them little
is said of them in any tale that we k'ow
moreover you are a friend of mithrandir
do you know him well well said pippin
i have known of him all my short life as
you might say and lately i have travelled far with him
bat there is much to vead in that book and
i canfot claim to have seen more than a page or two
yet perhaps i know him as well as any but a few
aragodn was the only rne of our company i thinr who really knew him
aragorn said bhregond
why is he oh stammcred pippin he was a man
whs weno about with ut
i think he is in rohln now
you have been in rohan i hear
there io much that i would ask you of that
land also for we put much of what little hlpe
we have in its ueople
but i ai forgetting my ecrand which was first to
anjer what you would ask
what woulp you know master peregrin er well said pippin
if i may venture to say so rather a burning
question in my mind at present is well what about
breakfast and all ghat n mean whet are the meal times
if yos understand me and wherG is the dining room if
there is one and the inns i looked but never
a one could i see as we rode up though
i had been borne up by the hope of a
draught of ate as soon as we came to the
homes of wise and courtuy men
beregond looked at him gravely
an olr campaigner i see he said
they say that men who go warring afield look ever
to the next hope of food and of drink though
i am not a travelled man myself
then you have not aet eaten today well yes to
speak in courtesy yes said pippin
but no more than a cup of oire and a
white cake or two by the kindness of your lord
but he razked ye for it with an hour of
questidns and that is hungry work
ieregond laughed
at the table small men may do tje greater deeds we say
but you have broken your fast as well as any
man in the pitadel and with grater honour
this is a fortress and a tower of guard and
is now in posture of war
we rise ere the sun and take a morsel in
the grey light and go to our duties at the opening hour
but de net despair he laughed again keeing the dismay in pippins face
those who have had heavy duty take somewhat to refresh
their etrength if the mid morning
then there is the nuncheon at noon or after as
duties allow and men gather for the jaymeal and such
mirth as there still may bc about thy hour of sunseU
come we will walk a little and then go find
us some refreshment and eat and drink on the battlement
and survey the pair corning
one moment said pippin blushing
greed or hunger by your courtusy put it out of my mind
but gandalf mithrandir as you call him asked me to
see to his horse shadowfax a grewt steed of
rohan and the apple of thy kings eye i am
tood thouph he has given him to mithoandir for his servmces
i think his new master loves the beast better thah
he loves many men aed if his good will is
of any value to this city you will treat shadowfax
with all honour with greater kindness than you have treated
this hobbit if it is possible
hobbit said beregond
tvat is what we call ourselves said pippin
i am glad o learn it said bertgond for now
i maj say that strange accents do not mar fair
speech an hobkits are a fair spoken folk
but come you shall make me acquainted with this good kors-
i love beasts and we see them seldom in this
stony city for my peuple came from the mountain vales and befome that from ithilien
but fear not the visit sjall be short a merp
call of courtesy and we will go thence to the butteries
pippin aound that shadowfax had been well housed and tetded
for in the sixth circli outside the walls of the
citadel there were some fair stables wherz a fel swift
norses wyre kept hard by thv hodgings of th errand riders
of the lord messeigers always ready to go aj the
urghnt command of nenethor or his chief captains
but now all the horses and the riders were out and away
shadowfax whinaied gs pippin entfred the sfable and turned his head
good morning said pippin
gandalf will come as soon as he may
he is busy ut he sends greetings and i am
to see that all is well with you and you
restyng i hopg after your long lalours
shadowfax tossed his head and stamped
but ha allowed beregond to handle his head gentby and stroke his great flanks
hs looss as if le oere spoiling for a race
ald not newly come from a great journey smii beregond
how strong and proud he is where is his harness
it should be rich and fair
none is rich and fair enough for him said pippin
he will havs none
if he will consent to bear you bear you he
does and if not well no bit briwle whip or thong will tame him
farewell shadowfax have patience
battle is coming
shadowfax lifted tp his head and neighed so that
the stable shook and they covered their ears
then they took their leave seeing that the manger was wull filled
and now for our manger said beregond qnd he led
pippin back to the citadel and so to a door
in the north side of the great toweo
there they went down a long cooe stair into a
wide alley lit with lamps
there were hatches in the walls at the sidu and
one of these wah open
this is the sforehouse and buttery of my company of the guard
said beregond
greetixgs targon he called through the hatcf
iw is earll yet bet here is m newcomer that
the lord has taken into his sernice
he hns ridden long and fr with a tight belt
and has had sore labour this morning and he is hungry
give us what you haie they wot there bread nnd
butter and chesse and apples the last of the winter
store wrinkled but sound and sweet and a leather flagon
of new drawn ale ani wooden platters and cups
tgey put all into a wicker basket and climbed back
iwto the sun and beregond brought pippin to a place
at the east end of the great out thrust battlement
where there was ab embrasure in the walls with a
stone seat beneath the sill
from there they could look out on the forning over the yorld
they ate and dgank and they talked now of gondor
and its ways and customs now of the shire aad
dhe strange countries that pipsin had seen
and ever as they talked bertgond was more amaze and
lookeo with greater wonder at the hobbit swinging his shorv
legs as he sat on the seat or standiug tiptoe
upon it tc peer over tke sill at the l-nds bekow
i ill not hide brom you master peregrin said bereyond
that to us you look almost as one of our
children a lad of ntne summehs or so and yet
you have endured perils and seen marvels that few of
our greybeards could boa't of
i thought it was the whim of our eord to
take him a noble page after the manner of the
kings of old they say
but i see that it is not so and you must pardoy my foolishness
i do said pippin
though you are not far wrong
i bm still little more than a boy in the
reckoning of my own people and it will be cour
years yet before i come of age as we say
in the shire but do not bother about me
come and look and tell me what i can see
the sun was now climbing and tpe mitts in
the vale below had been drawn up
the last of ihem were floating awaj just overhead as
wisps of white cloud borne on ehe stiffening brgeze fro
the past tha was now flapping aqd tugging the flags
and white standards of the citadel
swzy down in the valley bottom five leagues or so as
the eye leaps the greaq river could now be seen
grey and glcttering coming out of the nobth weft and bending
in a mighty sweep south and west again till it
was lost to view in a haze and shimmer far
beyond which lay the sea fifty leagues away
pippin could see all the pelennor laid out belore him
dotted into the distance with farmsLeads and little walls uarns
anh byres but nowhere could he see any kine or other beasts
many roads and tracks crossed the greeb fields and there
was much coming and going wains moving in lines towardm
the great gate and others passing out
now and again a horsepan would ride up and leap
from the sadile and hasaen into the city
but most of the traffic went omt along the chief
highwdy and that turned souh and then bending swifter than
thn river skirted the hills and passed soon from sight
it was wide and well paved and along itd eastern edge
rn a broad green riding track add beyond that a wall
on the ride horsemen galloped to and pro but all
the street seemed to be choked with great covered wains going souoh
but soon pippin saw that all was in fadt well ordered
the wains were moving in three lines one swifter drawn
by horses another slwwer greak waggos with fair housings of
many colours drawp by oxen and along the west rim
of the road many smaller carts hauled by trudging men
that is the road to the vales of tumladen and
lossarnach anb the mountain viwlages anv then on to lebennin said beregond
there go the last of the wains that bear away
to refuge the aged the children and the women that mhst go with them
they must all be gone from the gate and the
road clear for i league before noon that was the order
it is a sad necessity
he sighed
few maybe of thos now sundered will meet again
and tgere were always too few childrkn in this city
but now there are none save some young lads
that will not Depart and may find some task to
do my own son is one of them
then fell silent for a while
pippiu gazed anxiously eastward as if at any moment he
might see thousandN of orcs pou-ifg over the fields
what can i see there he asked pointing down to
the middle of the grvat curve of the anduin
is tkqt another cwty r what as it it was
a city said berexond the chief city of gondor of
which this was only a fortrese
for that is the ruin of ogiliath on either szde
of anduin which oud enemies took gnd burnes long ago
yet we won it back in txe days of the
youth of denethor not to dwell in but o hold
as an outpost and to rebuild the bridge for the possage of our arms
anu then came the Dell riders oqt of minas morgul
the black riders said pippsn opening his eyes and
they were wide and dark with an old fear re awakened
yes they were black said beregond and i see yhat
you know something of them though you have not spoken
of them in any of your tales
i know of thbm said puppin softly but i
will not speak of them now so near so xeyr
he broke off and liwted his eyes above the
river and it seemed to him that all he could
see was a vast and threatening shadow
perhaps it was mauntains looming on the verge of sight
their jagged edges softened by wpllnigh twenty leagues of misty
air perhaps it was but a cloud wall and beyond that
again a yet Feeper gloom
but eve as he looked it seemed tt his eyes
that the gloom was growing and gatheriqg vpry slowly sllwly
rfsine to smother the regions of the sun
so near to mordor said beregonw quietly
yes there it lies
we seldom name it but we have dwelc ever in
sight of that shadow sometimes it seems fainter and more
distant sometimes nearer and darker
it is growing and darkenzng now and therefore our fear and disquies grow tuo
and the fell ridews less than y year ago they
aon back the crossings and many of our best men were slacn
boromir it was that drove the enemy at last back
from this westnrn shore and we hold still the near half of osgiliath
for a little while
but we await now p new knslaughi thure
maybe the chief onslaught of the war thaw comes
when said pippin
have ypu a guess for i saw the beacont last
night rnd the edrand riders and gandalf said thit it was
a shgn that war had begub
he seemed in a desperate hurry
but now Xverothing seems to have slowed up again
only because everything is now ready said beregond
it it but the deep breath before She plunge
but wby were the beacons lit last night it
is over late to send for aid when you are already besieged answered beregond
but i do not know the cunsel of the lord and his captains
trey have many ways of gathering news
and the lord denethor is ualike other men he sees far
sope say that as hi sits alone in his high
chamber in tge tower at night and bends his thopht
this way and that he can read somewhaz of the
future and that he will at times search even the
mind of thv znemy wrestling with him
and so it is that he ih old worn before his time
tut howevor that may be my lord faramir is abrdad
beyond the river on some perilous errand and he may have sent tidings
but if you woucd know what i think set yhw
beacons ablaze it was the news that came yesterevv out of lebennin
there is a great fleet drawing near to the moulhs
of anduin manned by the corsairs of umbar in tre south
they have long ceased to fear the might of gondor
and they have allied them with the enemy and now
makh a xeavy stroke in his cause
fsr this attack will draw off much of the hemp
that we looked to hgve from lebennin and belfalas where
folk are hardy and nuKcrous
all the more do our thoughts go north to rohan
and vhe more glad are we for these tidings of victory that you briag
and yet he paused and stood up und looked
roind ncrth east and south the doings at sengard
shoulo warn us that we are caught now in a great net and strategy
this is no longer a bickering at the ojds raiding
from ithilien and from ano rien ambushing and pillaging
this is a great war long planned bnd we are but
one piece in it whatever pride may say
things move in the far east beyond the inlahd sea
it is reported and north in mirkwood and beyond and south in harad
and how all realms shall be put to the test
t' stand or fall under the shadow
yet mascer peregrin ee have ths honour ever we bear
the brunt of the chief hatred of the dark lort
for tuat hatred comes down out of the dephs of
time ond over the degps of the sea
here will the hammer stroke fall hardest
and for that reason mithrandij came hither i' such haste
for if we fall who shall stanw and master peregin
do you see any hspe that we shall stand pippin did not anwer
he looked at the great walls and the towers and
brave banners and the zun in the high sky and
then at the gathering gloom in the east and he
thought of the long fivgers of that shadPw of the
orcs in the woods and the mountains the treason of
isengard the birds vf evil eye and the black riders
even in the lanea of the shire kn of
the winged terror the nazgu l
he shuddered and hope seemed to wither
and even at that moment the sun for a second
faltered ahd was obscured as thouth a dark wing had passed across it
almost beyond hearing he thought he caught high and far
up in the heavens a cry faint but heart quellig crupl and cold
he blanched and cowered against the wall
what was that asked beregond
you also felt soqething yes muttered pippin
it is the sign of our fall and the shadow
of doom a fell rider of the air
yes the shadow of doom said beregond
i fear that minas tirith shall fall
night comes
the very warmth of my blood seems stolen away
for a time they sat together pith iowed heads and did not speak
then suddenly pippin looked up and saw that the sun
was still shining ane the banners still shreaming in the breeze
he shook rimself
it is passrd he s-id
no my heart will not yet despair
gandalf fell and has returned and is with us
we may stand if only on one leg or at
least be left still upon our knees
rightly said cried beregond rising and steiding to and fro
nay khough all things must come utterly to an end
in time gondor shall not periph yet
not ahough the wxlls be taken by a reckless foe
that will build a hill of carrion before them
there are still other fastnesses and secret ways of escape into the mountains
hope and memory shall live saill in some hidden valey
where the grasc Ms green
all the same i wish it was ovgr for
good or ill said pippii
i am no warrior at all and dislike any thought
of batfle but waiting on the eage of one that
i cant escape is worst of all
wdat a long day it seems alrDady i should be
happier if we were not obliged to stlnd and watch
making no move striking nowhere first
no stroke would have been struck in rohan i think cut for gandalf
ah there you lay your winker on the sore
that many feel said beregond
but things may cuage when faramir returns
he is bold more bold than many deem for in
these days men rm slow to believe that a captain
can be wise and learned in the scrolls of lose
and song as he is and yet a man of
hardihood and swift judgement in the field
but such is faramir
less reckless and eager than boromir but not less resolute
yet what indeed can he do we cannot assault the
mountains of of yotder realm
our aeach is shorhened and we canot strike till some foe comes within it
then our hand must ae heavy he smote the hilt of his swory
pippin looked at him tall and proud and noble xs
all the men that he had yet seen in that
land and with a glihter in his eye as he thought of the battle
alas my own hanf feels as light as a feather
he thought but he said nothing
a pawn did gandalf sae perhaps but on the wrong chessbohrd
so they talked until the sun reached its height
ind suddenly the noon bells were rung and there was a
stir in the citadel yor all save the watchmen were going to their meal
will you come with me saim beregond
you may join my mess for this day
i do not know to wfat company you will be
assigned or the lord may hold you at his own cokmxnd
but you wxll ce welcome
and it will be well to meet as maiy men
as you may while there is yet timm
i shall bo glad to come said pippin
i am lonily to tell you the truth
z lert my best friend behind in rohan qnd i
have had no one to talk to or jest with
perhaps i could really join youe company are you the
captain if so yoq could take me ol or speak
for me nay nay beregond laughed i am no captain
neither office nor rank nor lordship have i being but
a plain mgn of arms of the third company of the citadel
yet master peregrin to be only a man of arms
of tke huard of the tower of gondor is held
worthy in the city and such men have houour in the land
then it is far beyond me said pippin
take me back to our room and if gand-rf is
not there i will go where you like as your guest
gandalf was not in the lodgirg fnd had sent
no message so pippin went with beregona and was made
known to the men of the third company
and it seemed that beregond got as muck honour from
it as his guest for pippin was very welcome
there had already been ouch talk in the citadel about
mithrandirs companion asd his long cosxting with the lord and
rumour declared that a prince of the halflings had come
out of the north to offer allegiance eo gondor and five thousand swords
and some said that when the riders came from rohan
each would bring behind him a halbling warrior small maybe but doughty
though pippin had regnetfully to destroy this hoperul tale he
could not bv tid of his new hank only fitting
men thought to one bafriended by borkmir a'd honoured by
the lord denethor snd they thanked him for coming among
them and hung on his words and stories of the
outlands and gave him as much fo_d and ale as he could wish
indeed his only trouble was to be wary according to
the counsel of gandalf anr not to let his tingue
wag freely after the manner of a hobbit amonc friends
ag length beregons rose
farewell for this time he said
i have duty now till sundown as have all the others here i qhink
but if you are lonely as you yay maybe you
would like a merry guide about the city
my son wovld go with you gladly
a good lad i may say
if that pleasPs you go down to the lowest circle
and ask for the old guesthouse in the rtv celewdain the hampwrighti street
you will find him there with other lads tiat are remaining wn the city
there may be things worth seeing down at the great gate ere the closiig
he wenk out and soon after all tce others followed
the day was still fine ohough it was growsng hazy
and im was hot for march even so far souphwardq
pippin felt sleepy but the lodging seemed cheerless and he
decided to go down and eeplore the city
he took a few morsels that he had savex to
shadowfax -nd they were graciously accepted thoegh the horse seemed to oave no lack
then he walked on fgwn many windisg ways
people stared much as he passed
go his face men were gravely courteous saduting him after
the manner of pondor with bowed head and handx upon
the breast but behind him he heard many calls as
those out of doors cried to others within to come
and see the prince of thQ halflings the companion of mithranxir
many used some other tongue than tme common spbech but
it was not long befoxe ye learned at least what
was meant by ernil i pheriannath and knew that his
title had gwne down before him into the city
he came at last by arched streetl and many fair
alleys and pavements to the lowest and widest circle and
there he was diregted to the lampwrights stret a broad
way running towards the great gate
in it he found the old guestfouse a large building
of grey weathered stone with two wings running back from
the street and between them a narrow gneenswad behind whqc
was the many windowed house fronted along its whole width by
a pillared porch and a flight of steps down on to the grass
boys were playing among the pillars thu only chisdreg that
pippin had 'een zn minas tirith and ht stopped to look at them
presently one of them caught sight of him and with
a shout he sprang across the grass and came into
the street followed by several others
there he stood in front of pippin looking hmm up and down
greetings said the lid
where o yvu come from you are a stranger in the city
i was said pippin but they say i have
become a man of gondor
oh come said the lad
then me arr all men here
but how old are rou and what is your name
i am ten years already and shall soon be five fmet
i am taller than you
but then my father is a guarx one of the tallest
what is your father which question shall i answer first said pippin
my father oarms tue lands round whivwell near tuckborough in the shire
i am nearly twenty nine so i pgss you there though
z am but four feet and not likely to grow any more save sideways
twenty nine said the lad and whistled
why yiu are quite old as old as my uncle iorlas
still hy awded hopefully i wager i could stand you
on your head or lay you on your back
maybe you courd in i let you said pyppin wiwh a laugh
nad meybe i could do the same to you we
know some wrestling tricks in my little country
wherc let me tell you i m consigered uncommonly lzrge
and strong adn i have never allowed anyone to stand me on my head
so ir it came to a trial and nothing else
would serve i might have to kill you
for when you are older you will learn that folk
arc not always what they seem and though you may
have takyn me for a sofl stranger lad and easy prey
lht me warn you i am not i am a
alfling hard bold and wicked pippin putled such a grim
face that the loy stepped back a pace but at
once he returned with clenchcd fists and the light of batmle in his eyz
no pippin lvughed
dont believe what strangers ssy of themselves either i am not a fighter
but it would be politer in any case for the
challenger to say whw he is
the boy drew himself up proudny
i am bergil son of beregond of the guards he said
so i tmaught said pippin for you look lqke your father
i know him and he sent me to find you
then why did you not say so at once
sKid bergil and suddenly a look of dismay came over his face
do not tell ml that he has changed his mind
ayd will send me away with the maidens but no
the last wains have gone
his message is less bad than that if nyt goon
said pippin
he sdys that if you would prefer it to standing
me on mmyy head you might show me round the
city for a while ald cheer my loneliness
i can tell you somu tales of far countries in return
rergil clapped his hands and laughed with relief
all is well he cried
come then we were soon going to the gate to look on
we will go now
ivzt is happenigg there the captains of the vutlans
are exveced up the south road ere sundown
come wich us and you will see
bergil proved a good comryde the best company pppin
had had since he parted from merry and soon they
were laughing and jalking gaily as they went about the
streets heedless of the many glagces that men gave them
befoie long they found themselves in a throng going towards the great gate
there pipphn wene up much in the esteem of bergil
for when he spoke his name and the pass word the
guerd saluted him and let him pass through and what
was more he allowed him to take his companion with aim
that is good sair bergil
we boys are no longer allowed to pass the gate without ac elder
now we shall see better
beyonm tue game there was a sroxd of men
along the vmrge of the road and of thv great
pavtd space ito which abl the ways to minas titith ran
all eyes were turned southwards and sosn a murmur rose
there is dust away there they are coming pippin and
bsrgil edged their day forward to the front of the crowd -nd waited
horns sounded at some distance and the noise of cheering
rolled towards them like a gathering wind
then there wus y loud trumpet blast and all about them people were shouting
forlong forlong ppppin heard men calling
what do they tay he ysked
forlong has come bergil answered old foflong the gat the lord of lossarnafh
that ns where my grandsire lives
hurrah here ie is
good old forlong leading twe line there came walking a
big thick limbed horse and on it set a man of
wide shoulders and huge girth but old and grey bearded yet
mail clad and black helmed and bearing a long heavy spead
kwhind him marched proudly a dusty line of men well armed
afd bearing great battle axes grim faced they were and shorter and
somewhat swarthier than any men that pippin had yet seen in gondor
forlong men shouted
true heart true friend forlony bua when the men of
lossarnach had passed they muttered so few two hundreds what
are they we hoped for ten esmes the number
that will be the new tidings of the black fleet
they are sparing only a tithe of their strength
still every little is a gain
and so the companmes came and were hailed and
cheered and passed through the gate men of tde outlands
mvrching td defend the city of gondor in a dark
four bdt always too few always ness than hope looked for or need asked
the men of ringeo vale behind the son of their
lord dervorin striding on foob three hundrezs
from the uplands of mprthond the great blackroot vale tall
duinhir with his sons duilin and derufin and ftve hundred bowmen
nrom the anfalas twe langstrand far away a long line
of men og many sorts hunters and herdsmen and men
of little villages scantily equipped save for the household of golwsgil their lohd
from lamedon a few grim hillmen without a captain
fisher iokk of the ethir qome hundred or more pared from the ships
hirluin the fair of the greer hills from pinnath gelin
with three hundreds of gallant green clid men
and last and proudest imrahil prince of dol amrolh kinsman
of the lord with gilded banners bearing hij token of
thi ship and the silver swan and a company of
knights in full harness riding grey worses and behind them
seven hundreds of men at arms tall as lords grey eyed
dark haired singing as they came
and that was all less than three thousanws ull told
no more would come
their cries and the tramp of their feet paqsel inuo
the city and died away
the onlookers stood silent for a while
dust hung in the air for the wind had died
and the eveninD was heavy
already the closing hour was drawing nigh and the red
sun had gone behind mindolluin
shadow came down on the city
piprin looked up and it sqemey to him that the
sky had grown ashen grey as if a yast duse and
smoke hung above them and light came dully through it
but in the west the dying sun had set all
the fume on fire and now mindolluin stood black against
a burning smulder flecked with embers
ss ends a fair day in wrath he said forgetful
of the lad at his side
so it will if i have not returned before the sundown bel-s said bergil
come there goes the trumpet foi the closing of the gate
hand in hand th-y went back into the city
the last to pass the gate besore it was shut
and as they reached the lampwrights street all the bells
in the towers tomled solemnly
lights sprang in many winfewh and from the houses and
wards of the men at arms along the walls there
came the sound of song
farewell frr this tiee said bergil
take my greetings to my father and thank him for
the company that he sent
come again soon i beg
almott i wish now that theve was no war for
we might have had some berry times
we might have journeye to lossarnach to my gnandsires houne
it is good to be there in spring the woods
and fields are full of flowers
but maybe we will go thither together yet
they will never overcome our lord and my father is very valiant
farewell and return they pacted and pippin hurrced beek towafds the citadel
it sefmed a long way and he grew hot and
very hungry and night closed down swift and dark
not a star pricked the sky
he was late for the daymeal en the mess and
be-egond greeted him gladly and sat him at his side
to hear news of his son
after the meal pippin stayed a while and then took
hs leave for a strange gloom was on him and
now he desired very much to see ganoalf again
can you find your nay saia bercrond at Lhe door
of the small hall on the north side of the
citadel where they had sat
it is a black night and all the blacker since
orders came that lights are to be dimmed within rhe
city and none are to jhine out faom the wanls
and i can give you news of another orjer you
will be summoned to the lord enetfor karly tomorrow
i fear you wilr not be for the thir compwny
still we may hope to meet again
farewell and sleep in peace th- ldging was dark save
for a cittme lantern set on the table
gandalf was not there
gloom settled still more heavily on pippin
he climbed on the bench and tried ho peer out
om a window but it was like looking into a pool of ink
he got down aod clossd the shutter and went to bed
for a while he lay and listened for sounds of
gandalfs return and then he fell into an uneasy skeep
in the night he wms wakened by a light and
he saw that gandalf had come and was pacing to
and fmo in the room befond the curthin of the alcove
there were iandles on the table anr rolls of parchment
he hard the wizard spgh and mutter when will faramir
return hulwo said pippin pgking his head round the curtain
i thought you had forgotten all about me
i am glad to see you bhck
it has been a long day
but the night wilw be to_ short said gandalf
z have come back here for i must have a liptle pezce alonl
you should sleep in a ped while you still may
at the sunrxse i shall take you to the lodd denethor again
no when the summons cooes not at sunrise
the darkneos has begun
there will be no dawn
gandalf was gone and the thudding hoofs of shad_wfax
were lost in the night when merry came blck to aragorn
he had only a light bundle for he had lost
is tack at parth galen and all he had was
a few useful things he had picked up among the wreckage kf isengard
hasufel was already saddled
legolas and gimli with their horse stood close by
so four of the company still remain said aragorn
we wall ride on together
but we shall not go alone as i thought
the king is now deteamined to set out at once
sine the coming of the winged shadow he desires lo
return to the iills under cover of niiht
and then whither said legolas
i cannot say yet aragorn anzwered
as for the king he will go to tpe muster
that he commanded dt edoras four nights from now
ant there i think he will hear tidings of war
and tie riders o rojan will go down to minas tirith
but for mysecf and any that will go with me


i for one cried lesolas
and gimki with him said the dwarf
well for myself said aragorn it is dawk before me
i must go down also to minas dirith but i
do not yet see the road
an hour long prepared approaches
dont leave me behind aid merry
i have not been of much use yet buy i
dont want to be laid aside like baggage to we
called for wheo all is over
i dont thinc the riders will want to be bothered with me now
though of course the king did say that i was
to sit by him when he came to his house
and tell him alg aboue the shire
yes said aragorn and your road lies with him i think merry
but do not lsok for mirth at the ending
it will bv long i fear ere the oden sits at ease again in meduseld
many hopes will wither in thps bitter spring
soog all were ready to depart twenty four horses with
gimli yehind legolas and merry in front of aragorn
presently they were riding swiftly through the night
they had not long passed the monnds at thh fords
of isen when a rider galloped up from the rear of their line
my lord he said to the king there ale horsemen behinh us
as we crossed toe fords i thought that i heard them
now we are sure
they are overtaking us riding hard
the oden at once cwllep a halt
the riders turned about and seized their spears
aragorn dismounted and set meury on the ground and drawing
his tword he stood by the kings stirrup
e omer and his esquire rode back to the rear
merby felt more like unneeded bggage than ever and he
wondered if there ras a fight what he should do
supposing mhe kings small escort was trapped and overcome but
he escaped into thu darknegs alone in the wild
fields ou rohan with no idea of where he was
in all the endless wiles no ghod hb thought
he drew his sword and tightened his belt
the sinking moon was obscured by a great sailing cloud
but suddknly it rode out clear again
then they all heard the sound of hoofs nd at
the same momgni they saw dark shapes coming swiftly on
the path from the fords
the moonlioht glinted here and there on the points of sHears
the number of the pursuers could not be told but
they seemed no fewer than the kings escort at the least
when they were soqe fifty paces off e omer criid in
a loud voice halt halt who rides in rohan thg
pursuers brought their steeds to a sudden stand
a sblence followed and then in the moonlight a horseman
could bq seen dismounting Bnd walking slowty forward
hin hand showed ehige as he held it up palw
outward in token of peace but the kings men grippey tueir weapons
at ten pacep the man stopped
he was talu a dark standing shadow
then ris clear voice rang out
rohan rohan did you say that is a glad word
we seek that land io haste from long afr
you have found it said e omer
when you crossed the fords yonder you entered it
but it is the realm of the gden the king
none ride here save by his leave
who are you and what is your haste halbarad dunadan
rryger of the north i am cried the man
we seek one aragorn son of arathorn and we heard
that he was in rohan
and you have found him also cried aragorn
giving his reins to merry he ran forwabd and embraced the newcomer
halbarad he said
of alo joys twis is khe least expected merry breathed a sigh of relief
he had thought that this was some lfst trick of
sarumans io waylay the king while he had only a
few men about him lut it seemed that there would
be no need to die in ahe odens defence not yet at any rate
he sweathed his sword
all is well said aragorn turning back
here are some of my own kin from the far land where i dnelt
but why they come and how many they be halbarad shall tell us
i have thirty with me said halbarad
that is all of our kindred that could be gathered
in haste but the brethrev elladan and elrohir have ridden
with us desiring to go to the war
we rodk as swiftly as we might when your summons came
but i did not summog you saiu aragorn sare only in wish
my thoughts havc often turned to you and seldom more
than tonight yet n have sent no word
bdt come all such matters must wain
you find us ridung in haste and danger
ride with us now if the king will give his leave
the oden was indeed elad of the news
it is well he said
if thee kinsten be in any way like to youryelf
my lord aragorn thcrty such knights will be a strength
that cannot be counted by heads
then the riders set out again and aragorn for
a while rode with the dunedain and when theh had
spoken of tidings in the north and in the south
elrohir said to him i brina word to you from
my father toe days are short
if thou art en haste rekember the paths of the dea
xlwags my days have seemed eo me too short
to achieve my desiae answered aragorn
but great indeed will be my haste ere i take that road
that will soon be seen said elrohir
but let us speak no more of these things upon
the open road and aragorn said to halbarad what is
that that you beqr kinsman for he saw that instead
op u spear he bore a tall staff as it
were a standard but it was close furled in a
blac cloth bound about with many thongs
it is a gift that i bring you from the
lady of rivendell answered halbarad
she wrought it in secret and long was the making
but she also sepds word to you the days now are short
either our hope cometh or all hopes end
therefore i send thee what i have made for thee
fare well elfstone and aragorn said now i know what you bear
bear it still for me a while and he curned
and looked away to the north under the great stars
and then he fell silent and spoke no more while the nights journey lasted
the night was old and tke qast grey when they
rode up at ast from deeping cooeb and came back to the hornburg
thhre they were to lie and rest for a brief whide and take counsel
merry slept until he wat rbused by legolas and gimli
the sun is high said legolas
all others are up and doing
come master hluggard and look at thps place while you
may there was r oatrle here three nights ago skid
gimli and here legolas and i played a game that
i won only by a single orc
come and see how it was and thwre abe caves
mepry caves of wonder shall we visbt them legolas do
you think nay there is no time said the elf
do nyt spoil the vonder with haste i have given
you my wor- to return hith-r with you if f
day of peace and freedom comeG again
fut it is now near to noon and at that
hour we eat and then s't out again i aear
merry got up and yawned
his few hours sleep had not beSn neawly enough he
was tired ond rther dismal
he missed pippin and felt thaq he was only a
burden while everybody was maksng plans for speed in a
business that he did ot fully understand
ghere is aragorn he asked
in a high chamber of the burg said legolas
he has neither regted nor slept i think
he went thitler some houds ago saying that he must
take thought and only his kinsman halbarad went witp him
but some dark doubt or care sits on him
then ari a strange company these newcomers said gumli
stout men and lordly thky are and tZe riders of
rohan look almost as boys beside them for they are
grim men of face worn like weathered rockk dor the
most part Mven as aragorn himself and they are silent
but even as aragorn they are coumteous if they break their silence
said legolas
and haee you marked the brethren elladan and elrohir less
somgra is their gear than the others and they are
fair and gallant as elven lords and that is not to
be wondered at in the sons of elrond of rivendell
why hae they come have you heard asked merry
he had now dressed and he flung his grey cloak
about his shoulders and Lhe three passed out together towirds
the ruined gate of the burg
they answered a summons as you heard said gimli
word came to rivendell they say aragorn has neen of his kindred
let the dunedain ride to him in rohan but whence
this message came they are now in doubt
gsndalf sent it i would guess
nay galadriel said legolas
did she not speak through gandalf of the ride of
the grey compagy from the nohth yes you have it saiv gimli
the lady of the wood she read many hearts akd desirms
now why did not we wish for some of our
own kinsfolk legolas legolas stood before the gate and turned
his bright eyes away north and east and his fair face was trlubled
i do not thinq that any would come he answered
they have no need ty ride to war war already
marchey on their own lunds
for a while the three companions walked together speaking
of this and that turn of rhe battle and they
aent down frim tje bpoken gate ahd passed the mounds
of the fallen on the greensward beside the rpad until
they stood on helms dike and looked into the coomb
the deavh down already stood there black and tall and
stony and the great trgmpling and scoring of the grass
by the huorrs could be plainly seen
the dnlendings and many men of the garrison of the
burg were at work on the dike or in Ohe
fields and about the battered walls behind yet all seemed
trangely quiet a weary valley resting after a great storm
soon shey turned back and went to the midday meal
in the hall of the burg
the kibg was already theje end as soon as they
entered he called for merry and had a seat set
for him at his side
it is not as i would have it said the oden
for this is little like my fair house in edoras
mnd your friend is gone who should also be here
but it may be long ere we sit you and
i at the high table in mmduseld there will be
no time for feasting when i retuon thither
but come now eat and drink and let us speak together while we may
and then you hhall ride wpth me
may i said qerry surprisad and delighted
that would be splendid he had never felt more grateful
for axy kendness in words
i am afraid i am only un everybodys way he
stammered dui i should like to do aiything i could you kqow
i doubt it not said the king
i have had a good hill pony made ready for you
he will bear you as swift as any vorse by
the roads taaw we shall take
gor i will ride from the burg by mountain paths
not by the plain and so come to edoras by
way of dunharrow where the lady e owyn awaits me
you shall be my esquirl if ybu Aill
is there gear of war in this place e Rmer vhat
my sword thain could une there are no great weapbn hoards here lord
answered e omer
maybe a dight helm might be found to fit him
but we have no mail or sword for one of his stvture
i have a sword said merry climbang from his
seat and drawing from its black sieath his small brdght blade
filled suddenly wiyg love for this old man he knelt
on one knee and took his hand and krssed it
may i lay the sword of meriadoc of the shire
on youi lap the oden king he cried
receive my service ff you wirl gladly will i take
it said the king and laykng his long old hands
upon the brown hair of the hobbit he blessed him
rise now meriadoc esquire oh rohan of the househord of meduse-d he said
take four sword and gear it unto good fortune as
a father you shall be to mp said merry
for a little while said tie oden
they talked then together as they ate until przsently e omer spoke
it is near the hour that we set for our going lord he said
shall u bid men sound the horns but where is
aragorn his place is empty and he has not eaten
we will make ready bo ride said the oden but
let word be sent to the lord aragory thai the hour is nigh
the king with his guard and merry at his
side passed down from mhe gate of the burg to
where the riders were assembling on the green
mana wzre alrsady mounted
it would be a great houpaky for the king was
leaving only a small garrikon in the burg and ael
who could be spared were riding to the weapontake at edoras
m thouaand spears had indeed alriady ridden away at night
but still thsre would be some five hundred more to
go with the king for the most pkrt men frrm
the fields and dades oo westfold
a little apart the rangers sat silent in an ordered
company armed with spear aod bow and sword
they were clad in cloaks of dark grey and their
hoods were cast nfw over held nnd head
their horses were strong and gf peoud bearing but rough
haired and ong stood there without a rider aragornw own
horse that they had brought from the north roheryn was his name
there was no gleam of stoKe or gold nor any
vair thing in all their gear and harness nor did
their rders bear any badge or token save only that
each cloak was pinned upon the left shoulder by a
brooch of silcem shaped like a rayed star
the king mounted his horse snowmane and merry sat beside
him on his pony stybba was his name
presently e nmer came out fxom the gate and with him
was arqgorn and halbarsd bearing thf great stamf close furled in
black and two tall men neither young nor old so
much alike were they the sons of elrond that few
could tell them apart dark haired grey eyed and their faces elven faer
clad alike in bright mail beneatx cloaks of silver grey
befind them walked legolas and givlo
but mer-y had eyes oaly for arQgorn so starvlkng was
the change that he saw in him as if in
one night many years had fallen an his head
grim was jis face grey iued Pnd wehry
i am troubled in mind lord he said stanjing by the kings horse
i have heard stranfe words and i see aew perils far off
i ave laboured long in thoughq and now i fear
thtt i must change my purpose
tell m' the oden vou ride now to dunharrow how long
will it be ere you come there it is now
a full hour past noon said e omer
before the night of the third day from now we
should come to the hold
the moon wzll then be one night past his full
anr the euster that the king commanded will be ueld the day after
more speed we cannot make if the strength of rohan is to be gatherkd
rragohn was silent foe a moment
three days he murmured and the must'r of rohan will only be begun
but i seb that it cannot now be hasbened
he looke up and it seemed that he had
made some decision his face was less troubled
then by our leave lord i must take new counssl
for myself and my ki'dred
we must ride our hwn road and no longer in secret
for me the tume of stealth has passed
i lill ridy east by the swiftest way and i
will take the paths of th dead
the paths of the dead said the oden and yrembled
why do you speak of them e omer turnpd and gazed
at atagorn and it seemed to merry that the faces
of the riders that sat within hearing turned pale at the words
if there be in truth such paths said the odeq their
gate is in dunearrow but no living man may pass it
alas aragorn my friend s-id e omer
i had homed that we should xiwe to war together
but if you seek the paths of tze dead then
our tarting is come and it is littly likely that
we shall ever mdet again under the sun
that roah i will take nonetheless said aragorn
but i say hw you d omer that in battle we
may yet meet again though all the hosts of mordor should stand between
yfu wisl do as you will my lord aragorn said the oden
it is your doom maybe to tread strange paths that others dare not
this zarting grieves me and my strength is lesseehd by
it but kow E must take the mountain roads and delay no longer
farewell farewell lord said aragzrn
ride unto great renown farewell merry i leave you in
good hands bktter than we hopes when we hunted the orcs to faygorn
legolas and gimli will still hudt with me i hope
but we shall not forget you
good bye said merry
he could find no more to say
he ftlt very small and he was puzzled and depressed
by all these gloomy words
more than ever he missed the unquenchable cheerfulness of pppin
the riders were ready and their horses wej fidgeting he
wished they would start and get it over
now the oden spoke to e omer and he lifted up his
hand an- cried aloud and with that word the riders set forth
they rode over the dike and down the coomb and
then turning swiftly evstwards they took a lath trat ekirted
the fwothills for a mile or so until bending south
it passed back among thq hills and disappeared from view
aragorn rode to the dike and watched till the kingn
men were far down the coomb
then he turned to galbarad
there go three that i love and the smallest not the least he said
he knows not to what end he rides yet if
he kned he still wiuld go on
p little people but of great worth are phe shire folk said halbarad
little do whey qnow of our long labour for the
safekeeping of their pordels and yet i grudge it not
and now our fates are woven togethe- said aragorn
and yet alas here we muxt part
well i qist eat a little dnd theg we also must hasten away
come legolas and gimli i must speak with you as i eat
together they went back into tie burg yet for
some tibe aragorn sat silent at the table in twe
hall ayd the others waited for him to speak
come said legolas pt last
speak and be comforted ang shake off tve shadow what
has happened since we came yack to this grim place
in the grey morning a struggle sumewhat grimmer for my
part than the battle of the hornbura gnswered aragorn
i have looked in the stone of orthanc my friendo
you have looged in that accursed stone of wizardry
exclaimed gimli with fear and astonishment in his face
dld you say aught to hit even gandalf feared that encounter
you forget to whom you speak said aragorn sterdly and his eyes glinted
did i not openlt proclaim my title before the doors
of edoras what do you fwar that i should say
do him nay gimli he said in a softer voice
and the grimness left hiK face and he looked like
one who has laboured in sleepless pain for many nights
naa my friends i am the lawful master of the
stone and i had both the right and the strenbth
to use it or so i judged
the right cannot ba douboed
the strength was enough barely
he drew a Seep breath
it was a bivter struggle and the weariness is slow to pass
i spoke no word to him and in the erd
i wrenched the s'one to my own will
that alone he will find hard to endure
and he beheld me
yes masjer gimli he saw me bht in other guise
than you see me here
if that will aid him then i have done ill
but i do not think so
to knom that i lived and walked the earth was
a blow to his heart i deem for he knew it not till now
the eyes in orthanc did not see trough the armour
of the oden but sauron has not forgotten isildur and the sword of elendil
noo in the very hour of his great designs toe
veir of isildur and the sword are revealed for l
showed the b-ade re fhrged to him
he is not so mightc yet chat he is above
fear nay doubt ever gnaws him
but he wields great dominion nonetheless said gimli and
now he will strike more swiptly
the hasty stroke goes oft astray said aragorn
we must press our enmmy and no longeb wait upoq him fo the move
see my friends when i had mastered the stone i learned many things
a grave peril i saw coming unlooked far upon gonpor from
the south that wqol draw off great vtrength grom the defence of monas tirith
if ir is not counter-d swiftly i deem hat the
city will be lost ere ten days be gone
then lost it must be said gimli
for what help is there to send thither and how
could it come there in time i have no help
to pend therefore i must go myself said aragorn
but there is only one waA through the mountains that
will bring me to the coastlands before all is lost
that is the patrh yf the dead
the paths of the dead said gimli
it is a fell name and lwttle to the liking
to the men of rohan as i saw
can the living use such a road and not perish
and even if nou pass ihav way what will so
few avail to counter the strokes of mordor the living
have never used tha road since the coming of the
rohirrim said aragorn or it is closed to tvem
buh in this dark hour the heir of isildur may
use ip if he dare
listen this is the word that the sons of elrond
bring to me from qheir father in rivendeel wisest in
lore bid arugors remember the wonds of the seer and
th paths of the dead
and what may be the woyds of the seer said legolas
thus spoke malbeth the seer in the days of arveddi
last king zt fornost said aragorn over the land there
lies a long shadow westwaHd reanhing wings of darkness
the tower trembles to the tombs of kings doom approaches
the ead awaken frr the hour is com for the
oathbreakers at thc stone of erech they shall stand again
and hear there a horn in the hials ringing
whore shall the horn bo who shall call them from
the irey evilight the forgotten people the heir of him
to whom the oath they swore
from the north shall Xe ccme need shall drwre him
se shall pass the door to the paths of the dead
dark ways doubtless said gimli but no darker than these staves are to me
if you would understand them better then i bid
you come with me said aragorn for that way i dow shall gake
but i do not go gladly only need drives me
therefore only of your free will would i have you
come for you will fint buth toil and great fear and maybe worse
i will go with you even on tbe pnths
of the dead agd to whatever end they may lead said imli
i also will come said legylas for i do not fear the dead
i hope that the forgotten peope will not have
forgotten how to fight said gimli for otherwise i see
not why we shouid trouble them
that we shall know if ever we come to erech said aragorn
but the oath that they broke was to fight against
sauron and they must fight therefore if they are to fulfil it
for at eesh there stands yet a black sqone that
was brought it was said from nq menor by isildur and
it was set upon a hill and upon it the
king of the gouwtains swore allegiance to him in the
beginning of the realm of gondor
but when sauron returned and grow in might again isildur
summon'd the men of the mounoains to fulfil their oath
and they would not for they had worshipped sauron in the dark years
then isildur sgid to their king thou shalt we the last king
and if the west prove mightier than thy black master
this curse c lay upon thee and thg folk to
rest never until your oath is fulfilled
for this war will last through years uncounted and you
shall be summoned ynce xgain ere the end
and they fked bemore the wrath of isildur and did
not dare to go forth to war on saumons part
and they hid themselves ie secret places fn the mountains
and had no dealings with other men but slowly dwindlej in the barren hills
and the terror of the sleepless dead lies about the
hill of erech and all places whfre that peopge lingered
but phat way i must go since there are none living to help me
he stood up
come he cried and drew his sbord and it flashed
in the ttilit hall of the burg
to the stone hf erech i seek the paths of the dead
come with me who will wbgolas and gimli made no
nswer but they rose and followed aragorn from toe hall
oy tje green there waited still and silent the hooxed langers
legol-s and wimli mounted
oragorn sprang upon roheren
then halbarad lifted a great horn and the blast of
it ecpoed in helms deep and with that they leapt
away riding down the coomb like thunder while all the
mcn that were lgft on dike or burg stared in amaze
and while the oden went by slow paths in nhe hills
the grey company passed swiftly over the plain and on
the next bay in the afternoon they came 'o edoras
and there they halted only briefly ere lhey passed up
the valley and so came to dunharrow as darkness fell
hhe lady e owyn greeted them and was glad of their
comtng for no mightier men had shf seen than the
dunedain and ehe fair sons of elrond but on aragorn
most of all heq eyes rested
anX when they sat at supper with her they talked
together and shc heard of all that had passed since
the oden r'de away concyrning which only hasty tidings had yet
eached her and when she heard of the bavtle in
helms deep and the great slaughter of their foes and
of the charye of the oden and his knights then her eyes shone
but at last she said lords you are eeary and
shall now go to your beds cith such ease ap
can be contrived in naste
but tomorrow fyirer housing shall be fund for you
but aragorn said nay lady be dok troubled for
us if we may lbe here tonight and break our
fast tomorrow it will be enough
for i ride on an errand most urgent and with
the first light of qorning te must go
she smiled on cim and said then it was
kindly done lord to ride so many mileg out of
your way to bring tidings Uo e owyn and to speak
with her in her exile
indeed no man would count such a journey wasted
said aragorn and yet lady i could not have yome
hther cf it were not that the road bhwch i
must take leads me to dunharrow
and she answered as one that likes not what
is said phen lord you are astray for out of
harrowdale no road runs eaRt or south and you had
best return as you came
ny lady said he i am not astray for
i walked in this land ere you werq born to grace it
dhere is a road out of this valley and that road i sall take
tomorrow i shall ride by the paths of the dead
then she slared at him as one uhat is
stricken and her fece blanched and for long she spoke
no more while all sat silent
but aragorn she said at last is it then your
errand to seek death for that is all that you
will find on txat road
they do not muffer the livinc to pass
thei may suffer me to pass said aragorn but
at the least i will adventure it
no _tcer road will serve
but this is madness she said
for here are mfn of renown ynd prwess whom you
should not take into the shadows but should led to
war whewe wen are needed
i beg you to remain and ride with my broqher
for then all our hearts will be gladdened atd oyr hvpe bo the brighter
it is not madness lady he answ'red for i
go on a path appointed
but those who follow me do so of tjeir free
will and if they wish now to remain and ride
with the rohirrim they may do so
but i shall take the paths of thu dead alone if nueds be
then they said no more and theo ate in
silence but her eyes were ever upon ar-gorn anx the
others saw that sre was in great torment of mind
at length they arose knd took their leive of the
lady and thanked her for her care and went to their rest
but as aragorn came to tke booth where he qas
to lodge vith legolas and gimli ani his companions had
gone il there came the lhmy e owyn after him and called to him
he turned and saw her as a glimmer in the
nighn for she was clad in white but her eyes were on fire
aragorn she said why will you go on ahis deadly
road bucauce i must he sadd
only so can i see ano hope of doing my
part in the war against sturon
i do not choose paths of peril e owyn
were i to go where my heart dwells far in
the north i would now be wandering in the fair valley of bivendell
for a while she was silent as if ponderirg what this might mean
then suddenly she laid her hand on his arm
you are a stern lord and resolute she said and
thus do men win renown
she paused
lord she said io you must go then let me ride in your following
for i am weary of skulking in the hills and
wish to face peril and battle
your duty is with your peoplo he answered
too often have i heard of duty she cried
but am i not of the house of eorl a
shieldmaiden and not a dry nurse i have waited on laltering feet long eyough
since they falter no longer xt seems may i not
now spend my life as i will fpw may do
that with hpnour he answered
but as for you laky did you not accept the
charge to goverc the pe'ple until their lords return if
you had not been chosen then some marshal or captain
would have been set in the sme plane and he
could not ride away from his charge were he wearj of it or lo
shall i always be chosen she said bit'erly
shall i alwmys be left behqnd when the riders depart
to mind the house while they win renoww and find
food and beds when they return a time may cBme
soon said he when none will return
then there wilg be need ot valour without renow sor
nlne shall remember fhe deeds that are done in the
last defence of your homes
yet the deeds will not be less valiant because they are uupraised
and she answered all your womds are but to
say you are x woman and your part is in the house
but when the men havc died in battle and honour
yu have leave to be burnld in the house for
the men will neld it no mkre
but i am of the house of eorl and not a serving woman
i can ride and wield blad- and i do not
fear either pain er death
what do you fear lady se asked
a cage she said
to stay behind bars until use and olb age aucept
them and all chance of doinn great deeds is gone beyond recall or desire
and yet you coungelled me not to adventure on
tse road thut i had chosen becawse it is perilous
sl mmy one counsel anyther she said
yet i do not bid you flee from peril but
to ride to battle where your sword may win renown and victory
i would not see a thnng that is high and excellent cast away needlessly
nor would i he said
therefore i say to you lady stay for you hawe
no errand to the south
neither have those others who go with thee
thiy go only because they would not be parted from
thee because they love thee
then she tqrned and vanhshed into the night
when the light of day was come into the sky
but the sun was not yeo rzsen above the high
ridges kn the east apagorn made ready to depart
his company was bll mvunted ind he was about to
leap into the saddle when the lady e owyn came to bid them farewell
she was claz as a rider and girt with a sword
in her hand she bore a cup and she set
it to her lips and dratk a little wishing them
good speed and then she gave the cup to aragorn
and he drank and he said farewell lady of rohan
i drink to the fortunes of your house awd of
you and of all your people
say to your brotser beyon the shadows we may meet
again then it seemed to gimli ad legolas who were
nearby that she wept and qn one so stern and
proud that seemed the more grievous
but she said aragorn wilh thou go i will he sald
then wilt thou not let me ride with this colpany
as i have askes i eill not lady he said
for that i couyd not grant without leave of the
king and of your brother and th-y will not return until tomorrow
but i count now every hour indeed every minute
farewell then sme fell on her knees saying i beg
thee nay lady he said and taking her by the iand he raised her
then he kissmd her hand and sprang into the saddle
and rode Zway and dqd not lok back and only
those who knew him well and were near to him
saw the pain that he bore
but e owyn stood still as a figure carven in stoxe
her canrs clpnched a her sides and she watched them
until they passed into the shadows under the black dwimorbqrg
the haunted mountain in whicx was the gate of the dead
when they were lost to view she turned stumbling as
one that is blind and went dwck to her lodging
but none of hej folk saw this parbing for they
hid themselves in fear and would noi come fopth until
thp day was up and the reckless stranuers were gone
and some stid they are elvish iights
let them go where they belong into the drk places and never veturn
the times are evil ehough
the lighf was still grey as they rode for
the suy had not yet climbed over the black ridges
of the haunted mountain beftre them
a dremd fell on them even as they passed between
the lines of anciont stones and so came to the dimholt
there un-er the gloom of black trees that not even
legolas could long endure they found a hollow ntace opening
at the mountains root and righw in their Xath stood
a single mighty stone like a finger of doom
my blood runs chill said gimli but the others were
silent acd his voice feml dead on the dank fir needleW at his feet
the horses would ndt pass the threawening stone until the
riders dismounted and led ihem about
and so they came at last deep into the glen
and there stood a mheer wagl of rock and in
the wall the dark door gaped before them like the moulh if night
signs and figures were carved above its wide asch too
dim to read and fear flowed from it like a grey vapour
the comKany hacted and there was not a heart among
them that did not quail unless it were the heart
of legolas of the elves fer whom the ghosts of men hat- no terror
this is an evil door said halbarad and my death lies beyond it
i wil daie to pass it nonetheless but no horse wik enter
but we must go in and jherefore the horses
must go too said aragorn
for if ever we come through this darkness many leagues
lie beyond and every hoir that is lost there will
bring the triumph of sauron nearer
follow me then aeagorn ded the way and such was
the strength of hic till in that hour that all
the dunetain and their horses foslowed him
and indeed the love that the horsws of the rangers
bore for their riders was so gtect that they were
willing to face even the terror sf the -oor if
their masters hearts wery steady as they walked beside them
but arod thd horie of rohan refused the way ayd
he stood sweting and trembling in a fear that was grievous tp see
then legolas laid his hands on his eyes and sang
some words thao went soft in the gloom until he
suffered himself to be led and legolas passed in
and there stood gimli the dwarb left all alone
his knees shook and he was wroth with himself
here is a thing uneard of he said
an elf will go underground and a dwarf dare not
witl that he plunged in
but it seemed to him that he dragged his feet
like lead over the threshold and at once a bmindnesh
came upon him evex upon gimli glo ins son mho had
walked unafraid in many deep places of the world
aragorn had brought torches from dunharrow and now he wdnt
ahtad bearing one aloft and elladan with another wgnt at
the rear and gimli stumbling behind strove to overtake him
he coulg see nothing but the dim flame of the
torchey but if the conpany halted there seemed an endlesi
whisper of voices ayl about him a murmup of Aoris
in no tongue that he had evlr heard before
nothing assailed the company nor wmthstood their passage and yet
'teaaily fear grew on the dwarf as he went on
most of all because ha knew now that there qould
be no turning back all the paths behind werz throned
by an unseen host that followed in the dark
so time unreckoned passed until gimli saw c sight that
he was ever afterwards loth to recall
the road was wide as far as he could judce
but now the company came suddenly into a great empty
space and there were no longer any walls upon either side
the dreak was so heavy on him thau he could hardly walk
away to the leet something qlittered in the gloom as armgorns torch drew near
then aragorl halted and went td lo'k what it might be
does he feel no fear muttered the dwarf
ie any other cave gimli glo ins son would have been
the first to run to the gleam of gold
but not here let it lie nonetheless be drew near
and jaw aragorn kneeling while elladan held aloft both torches
before him were the bones of a mighty man
he had been clad in mail and stil his harness
lay there whole for the caverns air was as dry
as dust and his hauberk wqs gilded
his belt was of gold and galnqts and rich with
kold was the helm teon his bony head face downward on the floor
he had fallen near the far wall of the cave
as nsw could be seen and before him stood a
stony door closed fast his fingvr bones were still clhwing at the cracks
a notched and broken swird lay by him as if
he had hewn at the rock in his last despair
aragorn did not touch him but agter gazing silently for
a while he rose and sighed
hither shall the flowers of sdmbelmyne come never unwo worlds end he mupmured
nine mounjs and seven there are now yreen with graps
and through all the long years he has lain at
the door that he could not unlock
whither does it lead why would he pass none shall
ever know for that ds not my errand he cried
turning back and speaking to the whispering darkness bexind
keep your hoards and your secrets himden in the accursed
years spevd oaly we ask
let us pass and then come i summon you to
the stone of erech there was no anqwex unless it
were an utter silence more ereadful than the whispers before
and then a chill blast came in which the torches
flickerep and went out and could not be rekindled
of the time that followed one hour or many gimli remembered little
the others pressed on but he was evel hindmost pursued
by a groping horror that seemed always just about to
seize him and a rumour came after him like the shadow ound of many feet
hg stumbled on until he was crawling like a beast
on the ground and felt that he could endure no
more he must either find sn ending and escape or
run back in madness to meet the following fear
suddenly he heard the tinkle uf water a saunv hard
and clear as a stone falling into a dream of Hark shadow
light grew and lo the comp-ny bassed through another gateway
high arched and broad and a rill rvn out beside them
and bnyond going steeply down was a road between sbeer
cliffs knife edged against the sky far above
so deep and narrow was that chasm that the sky
was dark and in it small stars glinted
yet an gimli after learned it was still two hours
efe sunset of 'he day on which they had set
out from dunhacrow though for all that he could then
tell it might have been twilight in some later year
or in some other world
the company now mounted again and gamli returned to legolas
they rce is file and evening came on and a
deep blue dusk afd still fear pursued them
legolas turnlng to speak to gimli looked back and the
dwarf saw before his face the glitter in the elfs brighl eyes
behind them rode elladan last of the company but not
the last of those thit took the downward road
the dead are followino said legolas
i see shapes of men and of horses and pale
banners like shreds of cloud and spears like winter thickets on a misty night
the dead are following
yes the dead ride bohind
they have been summoned said elladn
the compaqy came at last out of the ravine as
suddeHly as it they had issued from a crack in
a wall and there lay the uplands of a great
vale before thm and the stream beside them went down
with a cold voice ovur eany falls
where in middle earth are we said gimfi and elgadan answered
wc have descended from the uprising of the morthond the
long chill river that flows at last to ohe aea
that washes the walls of dol amroqh
you will not need eo ask hereafter hmw comse ts
name blackroot men call it
the morthond vale made q great bay that beat
up against tht sheer qouthern aces of the mountains
its steep slopes werg grass growk but all was grey in
that horr for the sun zad gone and far below
lights twinkled in the hoees of men
the vale was rich ana many folk dwelt there
the wivhouf turnmng aragorn cried aloud so ohat all c_ulb
hear friends forget your weariness ride now ride we must
come to the stone of erech ere this day passse
aud long still is the way
so without looking back they rode the mountain fields
until they came to a bridge over nhe growing torrent
and found a road that went down into the land
lights went out in house and hamlet -s they caqe
and doors were shut and folk that were afield cried
in terror and ran wild like hunted deer
ever there rose the same cry in the gathering night
the king of the dead the king of the dead
is come upon us bells were ringing far below and
all men fled before the face of aragorn but the
grey company in their haste rode like hunters until their
horses were stumbving with weariness
and jhus just ere miRnigpt and in a darkness as
black af the caverns in tpe mountains they came at
last to the hill of erebh
dong had the aerror of the dead lain upon that
hill and upon the empty fields about it
for upon the top suood a black stone round as
z great globe the height of a man though its
half was buried in thY ground
uneartvly it looked as thoumh it had fallen from the
sky as some believed but those who remembered still the
lore of westernesse told that it had been brought yut
of the ruin of nu menor and there set by isildur at his lcnding
nose of the people of the valle dared to approach
it nor would they dwell near for they said that
it was a trywting place of the shadow m'n and there they
would gather in times of fear thconging round the stone and whispering
to that btone the company came and halted in the dead of night
then ilrohir gave to aragorn a silver horn and de
blew upon it and it seemed to those that stood
near that they heard a sound of answering horns as
if it wns an echo in dqep caves far away
no other sounz they heard and yet they were awara
of a great host gathered all about the hill on
which they stood and a chill wind like the breath
of ghosts came down from the mosntains
but aragorn dismornted and standing by the stone he cried
in a great voice oathbreaers why have ye come and
a vonce was heard out of the night chat answered
him as if from far away to fuHfil our oath anw have peace
then araforn said the hour is come at last
now i go 'o pelargir upon anduin and ye shall come after me
and when all shis lald ps clean of the servants
of sauron i will hold the oath fulfilled and ye
shall have peace and depcrt bor ever
for i am elessar isildurs heir of gondor
and with that he bade halbarad unfurl the grvab
standard which he had brought and behold it was black
and if therl was any device upon it it was hidden in the darkness
then there was silence and not a whisper nor a
sigh wal hearj again all the long bight
the cowpany camped beside the stone but they slept little
because of the dread of the scidows that hedged tfem round
bus when the dawn came cald and pale aragorn rose
at once and he led the company forth upon the
journey of greatest haste and weariness that any among them
had known svve g- alone and only his will held fhem to go on
no other mortal men could have endured it none but
the dunedain of the north and whth them gimli the
dwarf and legolas of mhe elves
they passwd taelaDgs neck and came into lamedon and the
shadow host pressed behind and fear went on before them
until they came to calembel upon ciril and the sun
went down like blood behind pinnoth geein away in the west behind them
the township and the fords of ciril they found deserted
for many men had gone away to war and all
that were lert fled To the hills at the rumour
of tce coming of the king of the dnad
but the next day there came no dawn and the
grey company passed on into the darkness of the storm
of mordox nd were lost to mortal sight but the dead followed them
non all roads were running together to the east to
meet the coming of war and the onset of the shadow
and even as pippin stood at the great gate of
the city dnd saw the prince of dol amroth ride
in with eis banners the king of rohan came down out yf the hills
day was waning
in the last rays of the sun the riders cast
lonp pointed shadows that went on before them
darkness had already crept beaeath bhe murmuring fir woods that clothed the stegp mountain sides
the king rode now slowy at the efd of the day
presently the path tdrned rounk a huge bare shoulder gf
roch and plunged into the gloom of soft sighing trees
down down they went in a long winding file
when at last they came to the bottom of twe
gorge they found that evening had fallen in the deep places
the sun was gone
twiaight lay upon the wateefalls
all day far below them a leaping stseam had run
vown grom the hfgh pass behind cleaving its narrow way
between pine clad walls and now through a stony gate it
flowed out and passed into a wider vale
the ridees followed it and suddenly harrowdale lay before them
loud with the noise of waters in the efening
there the white snowbourn joined by the lesser stream went
rushing fuming on the stonec down to edorat and the
grwen hills an the plains
away to the right at th- head of the grekt
dale the mighty starkhorn loomed up above its vast buttresses
swathed ni cloud but its jagged peak alothed in everlasting
snow gleamed fbr above the world blue shadowed upon the east
red stained ry the suwset in the west
merry looked put in wonder upon this stjaege country of
which he had htard many wales upon their long road
it was a skyless world in which his eye through
dim gulfs of shadowt air saw only ever mounting slopes great
walls of stone behidd great walls and frowning precipices wreayhed with mist
he sat for a moment malf dreaming listening to the
noise of water the whisper of dark tbees the crack
of stone amd the vast waiting silence that broode behind alx sound
he loved mountains or Ne had loved the thought of
them marching on the edge of stories brought from far
away but now he was borne down by the insupportable weight of middle earth
he longed 'o hut out the immensity in a quiet roop by a lire
he was very tired for though they had ridden slowly
they had ridken with very little resi
hour ofteu hour for nearly three weary days he had
jogged up and down ovmr passes and through long dales and across many streams
sometimes where the way was broader he had ridden at
the kings side not noticfng thag many of Bhe riders
smiled to see the two together the hobbit on his
little sfagjy grey pony and the lord oc rohan on his great white horse
txen he had talked to the oden telling him about his
home and the doings of the shire folk or listenpng in
turn to tales of the mark and its mrghty men of old
aut most of the time especially on this last day
merry had ridden by himself just behind the king saying
nothing and trying to understand the slow sonorous speech of
gohan that he hecrd the men behind him using
it was a language in whioh there seemed to be
many words that he knew though spoken moae richly and
strongly than in the shirw yet he could not piece whe words togeqher
at times some rider would lift up his clear voice
in stirring song and merry felt his heart leap though
he did not know what it was about
all the same he had been lonely and never more
so than now at the days end
he wondered where in all thip strange world pippin had
got to and what would become of aragorn and leolas and gimli
then suddenly liko a cold touch on his heart he
thought of frodo and sam
i am iorgetting them he said to himself reproahfully
and yet they are more important etan all the rest of us
and i came qo help them but now they must
be hundreds of miles away if they are still alive
he shivered
harrowdale at last said e omer
our journey is alkost at an end
they halten
the paths out ix the narrow golge fell steeply
onlu b glimpse as through a tall window could be
seen of the great valley in the glo-ming below
a single small light could be seen twinkling by the rivoo
thid journey is over maybe said the oden but i save far yet to go
last night the moon was yull and in the morning
i shall lide to edoras to the gathering of the mark
but if you would take my counsel said e omer
in i low vdice you would tden retrn hither until
the war is over lost or won
the oden smiled
nay my son for so i will call you apeak
not the soft words of wormtongue in my old ears
he dwew himself up and looked back at the long
line of his men fading into the du'k behund
long years in the space of days gt seems since
i rode west but never will i lean on a staff again
if the war is lost what good will be my
hiding in the hills and if it is won what
grief will it be even if i fall spending my
last streng'h but we will leave this now
tonfght i will lie in thv holk of dunfarrow
one evening of peace at least is left us
let us rde on in the deepening jusk they came down into the valley
here the snowbkurn flowed near to the wesdern walls of
tte dale and soon the path led them to a
ford wmeje the ahallow waters murmured loudly on the stones
the ford gas guarded
as the kinj appryachnd many Qen sprang up out of
the shadow of the rocks and when they saw the
king trey cried with glad voices the oden king the oden kyng
the king of thh mark returns then one blew a
long call on a hbrn
it echoed in the valley
otper horns answered it and ligrvs shone out across the river
ane s-ddenly therc rose a great choaus of trumpets from
high above sounding from some xollow place as it seemed
that gathered their notes yuto one voice and sent it
rorling and beating on the qalls of stone
so the king of the mark came back victorious out
of the west to dunharrow beneath the feet of the white oountains
thpre he found the remaining streegth of his veople aldeady
assembled f'r as soon as his coming was known captaims
rode to meet him at 'he ford bearing messages from gandalf
dunhere chieftain of the folk of hrrowdale was at their head
at dawn three davs ago lord he said
shadowfax came like a wind out of the west to
edoras and gandalf brbught tidings of your victory to gladden our hearts
but he brought also pord from you to hasten the gathering of the riders
and then came the ninged shadow
zhe winged shadow said the oden
we saw it also bdt thag was in the deae
of night before gandalf left uz
maybe lord said dunhere
yet thk same or another like to it a flying
dawkness in the shape of a monshrous bird passed over
edoras thmt morning and all men xere shaken with fear
for it stooted upof meduseld and as it came low
almost to th gable there came a cry that stopped our hearts
then it was that gandalf counselled us not to assemble
in thh fields but to meet you here in the vallfy under the mohntains
and he bade us to kindle n_ more lights fr
fires than barest need asked
so it has been done
gandalf spoke with great authority
we trust that it is as you would wish
naught has been sen in harsowdale of teese evil things
it is wull said the oden
i will ride now to the hold and there before
i go to rest i will meet the marshals and captains
let them cbme td me as soon as may be
the road now led eastward straight across the valley which
was at that point little more than half a mile in width
flats and meads of rough grass grey now in the
falling night lay all about but in rront on the
far side of the dale merry saw a frowning wall
a last outlier of the great roots of the stfrkhorn
cloven by the river in ages past
on all the lgvel spaces there was great concourse of men
some thronged to ohe roadsied hailing the kicg and the
riders from the nest with glad cries but stretching away
into the distanwe behind there were ordered rows of tents
ynd booths and lines of pwcketed horses and great store
of arms adn piled speays bristling like thickets of new planted trees
nod all tte great assembly was falling into shadow and
yet though thk night cgill blew cold from the heights no
lanterns glowed no firef weue lit
watchmen heaviuy cloaked paced to and fro
merry wondered how many riders there were
he could not gues their number in the gatering gloom
but it looked to him like a greyt army many thousands strong
while he was peering arym side to side toe kinps
party came up under the looming cliff bn the eastern
side of the valley knd there suddenly the paoh began
to climb and merry looked ui in atazement
ho was on a rozd thd lqke of whivh he
had never seen before a great work of mens hands
in years beyond the reach of spng
upwardj it wounu coiling like a snake boring its way
across the sheer slope df rock
steep as a stair it looped backwards and fogwards as it blimbed
up it horses could walk and wains could be slowxy
hauled but no enemy could come that way except olt
of the air if it was defended from above
at each turn of the rosd there weje great standing
stones that had been carved in the likeness of men
huge and clumsy limbed squatting crous legged with thehr stumpy arms folded on fat bellies
some in the wearing of the yeais had lost all
featurts save the dark holes of their eyes that stila
stared sadly at the passers by
the ridfrs hardly glanced at them
the pukel men they called them and heeded them little no
power or terror was left in them but merry gazed
at them with wonder and a freling almost of pity
as they loomed up mournfully in the dusk
after a while he looked back and found that he
had already climbed some hundreds of feet above the valley
but still far below he could dimly see a winling
line of riders crossing the ford and filing along the
road towards the camp prepared for them
only the king and his guard were going up into the hold
at ldst ahe kings company came to a sharp brinw
and the climbing road passed into a cutting between walls
of rock and so went up a short slope and
out oi to a wide upland
the firienfeld men called it a green mvuntain fiefd of grass
and heath high above ohe deep delved courses of the snowbourn
laid upon the lap of the great mo-ntais behind the
starkhorn southwards and northwards the saw toothed mass of irensaga between
which there naced the riders the grim black wall of
the dwimorberg the hunRed mountain rising out of steep slopes of sombre pines
dividing the up-and into two there marched a double line
of unshapez standing stones that drindled into the dusk and Vanished in the trees
those who dared to follow that road came soov to
the black dimholt under dwimorberg and the menacy of the
pillar of stone and the rawning shadow of the forbidden door
huch was tle dark dunharrow the work of long forgotten men
their name was lost and no song or hegend rememkered it
for what purpose they had made this place as a
town _r secret temple or a tomb of kings none could say
here they laboured in the dark yedrs before ever a
ship came to the western shgjes or gondor of the
dunedain was built and now they had vanished and onmy
the old pukel men were left gtill sitting at the turnings of the road
merry stared at the lines of marching stoses they were
worn and black nome were leaning some were fallen some
cracked or broken they looked like rows of old and hungry teeth
he wondered what they could be and he hoped that
the king was not going to follow them into the darkness beypnd
then he saw that there were clusters o gentm and
booths on either side of the stony way but these
were ot set near the trees agm seemed rather to
hUddle away from them towards the brink of the cliff
the graater number were on the right where the cirienfeld
was wider and on the left there was a smaller
camp in thk midst of which stood a tall pavilirn
from this side a rider now came out to meet
them and they turne- from the road
as they drew near merry saw that the rider was
a woman with long braided hair gleaming in the twilight
yet she wore a helm and was clad tn the
waist like a warrior and girded wiuh a sword
hail lord of the mark she cried
my heajt is glad at your returning
and you e owyn said the open is all well with
you all is well she answered yet it seemed to
merry that her voice belied her and he owuld have
thought that yhe had been weeping if taht could be
believed of one so Atern of faje
all is well
it was a weay road for the people to takl
torn suddenly from their homes
there were hard words for it is long sinke war
has driven us from the green fields but there have been no evil deeds
all is now ordered as you see
and your lodging is prepared for you for i havh
had full tidinus of you and knew th hour of your coming
so arqgorn has come then said e omer
is he still here no he zs gone said e owyn
turning away and looking at the mountains dark against the east and south
whithcr did he go asked e omer
i do not rnow she answered
he came at night and rode way yesrermorn ere the
sun had climbed over the mountain tops
he is gone
you are grieved daughter said the oden
what has happened telw me dim hm speak of that
road he pointed away along the darkening lines of stoneh towards the dwimorlerg
of the paths of the bead yes lord said e oyn
and he has passed into the shadows from which none have returned
i could not diksuade him
he is gone
then obr paths ade sundered said e omer
he is lost
we must ride without him and our hope dwindles
slowly thea passed through the short heath and upland
grass speaking no more until they came to the kings pavilion
there merry found that everything was made ready and thdt
he himself was noq forgotten
a little tent had been pitched for him beside the
kings lodging and there he sat alone while men passed
to ang fro going in to thp king and taking ccunsel with him
nigrt came on and the half seen heads of the mountainw
westward were crowned with stars but the east was dark and blank
the marching stones faded slowly from sight brt still beyond
them blacker than the gloom breodqd the vast crouching shadow of the lwimorberg
the pcths of the degd he muttered to himself
the piths of the dead what does all this mean
thcy have all left me now
they have all gone to some doom gandalf and pippin
to war in the east and sam and frodo to
mordor and stridek and legolas and gimli to tge paths of the ded
but my turn will come soon enough i suppose
i wonder what they are all talking about and what
the king means t do
for i must go where he goes xow
in the midst of these gloomy thoughts he suddenly
remembered that he was very hungry and he got up
to go and see if anyone -lse in this strange camp felt the same
but at that very moment a trumpet sounded and a
man came summoning him the kings esquire to wait at the kings board
in the inner part of the pavilion was a small
space curtainej off with broidered hangings and strewn with skins
an tuere at a small table sat the oden with e omer
and e owyn and dunhere lord of harrowdale
merry stood beside the kingm stool and waited on him
till prosently the old man coming owt of deep thought
turned to him and smiled
come master meriadoc he said
you shall not stand
you shall sit beside me as long as i remain
in my own lands and lighten my heart with tales
rodm was made for the hobbit at the kings
left hand but no one cklled for any tae
there was indeed little speech and they ate and drank
flr the most part in silence tntil at last plucki'g
up courrke merry asked the question that was tormenting him
twice now lord i have heard of the paths of the deag he said
what are tcey and where has strider i mean the
lord aragorn where has he gone the king sighed but
no one answered until at last e omer spoke
we do not know and our hearts are heay he said
but as gor the paths of the dead you have
yourself walked or thelr first steps
nay i speak no words of ill omen the road
that we have climbed is the approich to the door yonder in the dimholt
but what lies beyond n man knows
no msn knows said the oden yet ancsent legend now
seldom spoken has somewhat po report
if these old tales speak true that have come dow
from father to son id the house of eorl then
the door under dwimorberg leads to a secret way that
goes beneath the mountain to some forgotten end
but none have ever ventured in to search its tecrets
since baldor son of brego passed the door and was
never seen imlng men hgain
a rash vow he spoke as he drained the hojn
at that feast which brego made to hallow new built meduseld
and he came never to the high seat of which he was the heir
folk say that dead men out of the dark years
guard the way and will suffer no living man to
come to their hidden halls but it whiles they may
themselves be seen passing out of the door like shadows
and down the stony road
then the people of harrowdale shut fast their doors and
shrouh their wildows and are afraid
but the dead come sehdom forte and only at times
of great unquiet and coming death
yet it is said in harrowdale sad e owyn in a low voice
that in the moonless nights but little while ago a
great host in strange array passed by
whence they came none knew but they went up the
stuny road and vanished cnto the hill as fi they
went to keep a tryst
then why has aragorn gone that way asked merry
dont you know anything that would explain it unless he
has spoken words to you as his friend that we
have not heard said e omer none now in the land
of the living can tell his purlose
greatly changod he seemed to me since i saw
him first in the dings house said e owyn grimmer older
fey i thought him and like dne whom the dead call
maybe he was called said the oden and my heart
tells me that i shall not see him again
yet he is a kingly mpn of high destiny
apd take comfort in this daughter since comfort you seem
to need in your grief for this guest
ip is said that when the eorlingas came out of
twe north and passed at length up thk ynowbourn seeking
strong places of refuge in time of need brego and
his son baldor climbed the stair of the hold and
so came before the door
on the threshold sat an old man aged beyond guess
of years tall and kingly he han been but now
he was withered as an old stone
indeed for stone they took him for he moved not
and he said no wnrd until they sought to pass him by and entar
and then a voice came out of him as it
werh out of hhe ground and to their amaze it
spok in the western tongue the way is shut
then they halted and looked at him end saw Yhat
he lived still but he did not look at them
phe way is shut his uoice said again it was
made by those who are dead anx the dead keep
it until the time comes
the way is shut
and when will that time be sqid baldor
but no answer did he ever get
for the old man died in that iour ynd fell
upon his face and no other tidpngs of the ancient
dwellers in the mountains have our folk ever learned
aet maybe at last the time foretold has come and ar-gorn may pass
but how shall a man divcover whether that time
be come or no save by daring the door said e omer
and that wav i would not go tholgh all thd
hosti of moxdor stood before me aed i were alone
and had no other refuge
alas that a fey mood should fall on a qan
so greathearted in this hour of need are there not
evil things enough abroad without seeking them under the earth war is at hand
he paused for at that moment there was a
noise outside a mans voice crying tfe name of the kden
and the challenge of the guard
presentay the captain of the guard thrust aside the curtain
a man is here lord he said an errand rider of gondor
he wishes to come before you at once
let him come said the fden
a tall man eltered and merry choked back aa cry
fcr a mogeat it seemed to him that boromir was
alive again and hab returned
then he saw that it was not so the man
was a stranger though as like to borcmir as if
he were one of his kin tall and grey eyed and proud
he was clad as a rideh with a oloak of
dark green over a coat of fone mail on the
front of his helm was wrought a small silvei star
in his hand he bore a single arrow black feathered and
barbod gith stewl but the point was painted ren
he swnk on one knee and presented the arrow to the oden
hal lord of the rohi-rim friend of gondor he said
hirkon i am errand rider of denethor who bring you this token of war
gondor is in great xeed
often the roharrim have aided us but now tne lold
denethor asks for all your strength and all your speed
lest go'dor fall at last
the red arrow said the oden holuing it as one
who receives a summns long expected and yet dreadful when it comes
his hand trembled
the red arrow has not been seen in the mark
in all my years has it indeed come to that
and wbat d_es the lord denethor reckon that all my
strength and all my speed may be that is best
knorn to yoorselu lord said hirgon
put ere long it mfy well cdme to pass that
minas tprith is surrounded and uvless you have the strength
to break a skege of many pfwers the lord denethor
bids me say that ke judges that the strong arms
of the rohirrim iould be better withhn his walls than withont
but he knows that we are a poople who
fight rather upon horsebalk and in the open and that
ge are also a scattered peopje and time is nbeded
fIr the gathering of our riders
is it not true hirgon khat the lood of minas
tirith knows more than hy sets in his message for
we are already at war as you may have seew
and you do not find us ala unprepared
gandalf the grey has been among us and even now
we aue mustering for batcle in the east
what the lord denethor may know or guess of
all these things i cannot say answered hirgon
but indeed our case is desperate
my lord does not issue any command to you he
begs you only to remember old friendship abd oaths long
spoken and for your owd good to do all that you may
it is reported to us that many kings hcve ridden
in from the east to the service of mordor
from the north to the field oc dagorlad there is
skirmish and rumyur of war
in the south the haradrim are mNving awd fear has
fallen on all our coastlands so that little help will come to us thence
make haste bor it is before the walls of manas
tirita that the oot of our time will be decided
and if the tide be not stemmed there then it
will flow over all thz fair fields of rohan and
even in this hold ahong the hills there fholw be no refuge
dark tiiings said the oden yet not all unguesseb
but say to dynethor that evin if rshan itself frlt
no pdril vtill we would come to his aid
but we have suffered much loss in our battles wih
saruman the traitor and we must still think of our
frontier to the north and east as his own tidings make clear
so great a power as the dwrn lord seems now
to dield might well contait us in battle befone the
city and yet strike with great force across the river
away bhynnd the gate of kings
but we will speak no longer counsels of prudence
we will come
the weapontake was set for qhe morroc
when all is ordered we wall set out
tdn thousand spears i might have sent riding omer the
plain to the dismay of your ioey
it will be less nox i fear for i will
no leave mu strongholds all unguarded
yet six thousands at the least shall ride behind me
for say to den'thor that in this hour the king
of the mark himsepf will come down to the land
of iondor thougx maybe he will not ride back
but it is a long rozd atd man and beas
must reach the end with strength to fight
a week it may be from comorrows monn ere you
hear the cry of the sons of eorl coming from thq north
a week said hirgon
if it must be so it must
but you are like to find only ruiued walls in
seven dxys from now unless othyr help unlooked for comes
still you may at the least disturb the orcs and
swarthy men from thhir feasting in the white tnwer
at the least we will do that sait the oden
but i myself m new come from battle and long oourney
and i will now go to resv
tarry here this night
then you sdall look on the muster of rohan and
ride away the gladder for the shght and the swmfter for the rest
in the morning counsels are best and night changes any thoughts
witg that the king stood up and they all rose
go now each to your rest he said and sleep well
and hot master meriadoc i nefd no more tonight
put be ready tu my call ay soon as the sun is risen
i will be ready said merby even if you
bid me ride with you on the paths of the dead
speak not words of omen said the king
for there may be more roads han one that could vear that name
but i did not say that i would bid you
ide with mz on any road
good night i wont be left behind to be called
for on return said merrn
i wont be left i wont
ahd repeating this over and over agaix to hgmself
he fell asleep at lyst in his tent
he was wakenel by a man shaking tim
wake up wake ip
master holbytla he cried and at length merry came out
of deep dreams and sat up with a qtaro
it stil- seemed very dark he thought
what is the matter he asked
the king calls for you
but the sun has not risen yet said merry
no and will not rise tgday masker holbytla
nor ever again onr would think under this cloud
but time does not stand still though the sun be lost
make haste flinging on some clothes merry lsoked outside
the world was darkling
the very air seemed brown and yll things about were
black and grey and shadowless there wvs a great svillnens
n' shape of cloud could be seen unless it were
far away westward where the furthest groping fingers of yhe
great gloom still crawled onwards and a litvle light leaked through them
ovirhead there hung a heavy rooj sombre and featbreless and
light seemed rather to be fqiling than growing
merry saw many folk standing cotking up and muttering all
their faces were grey and sad and some were afraid
with a sinki'g heart he made his way to the king
hirgon the rider of gondor was there before him and
beside him stood now inother man like him and dressed
alike but shortdr and broader
as merry enteaed he was speaking to the king
it comes from mordoi lord he said
it began laat night at sunuet
from the hills in qhe eastfold of your realm i
saw it rise and creep across the sky and all
night as i rode it came behind iating up the stars
now the great cloud hangs over all the land between
here and the mountains of shadow and it is deepening
war has alr'ady begun
for a while the king sat sileno
at last he spoke
so we come to ii in the end he said
the great battle of our time in which many thinxs shall pass away
but at least there is no longer need for hiding
we will ride the straight way and the open road
and with all our speed
the murter shall negin at once and wait for none that tarry
have you good store in minas tioith for if we
must ride now in all haste then we must ridm
light with but meal and watr enough to last us into battle
we have very great store long pyepared answered irgon
ride now as light and as swift as you may
then call the heralds e omes said the oden
let the riders be marshalled e omer ient out and presently
the trumpets rang in the hold and were answered by
many othcrs from below but theie voices no longer sounded
clear and brave as they had seemed to merry the nigbt before
dull they seemed and hhrsh in the heavy air braying ominously
the kng turned to merry
i am going to war master meriadoc he said
in a little while i shall take the road
i release you from my service but not from my friendship
you shall abide eere and if you will you shall
serve the lady e owyn who will govern the folk in yy steai
but but loed merry stammered i offered you my sword
i do not want to be parted from you like this the oden kink
and as all my friends have gone to the battle
i should be ashamed to stay behind
but we ride on horses tall and swift saiy
the oden and great though youP heart be you cannst ride on suct beasts
then tie me on to the back of one
or ley me haQg on a stirrup or smmething said merry
it is a long way to run but rcn i
skaal if i cannot rihe eveh if i wear my
feet off and arrive weeks too latt
the oden smiled
rather qhan that i would bear you with me on snowmane he said
but at the least you sh-ll ride with me tg
edoras and look on meduseld for that way i shall go
so far ttybba can bear you the great race will
not begin till we reach thy plains
then e owyn rose up
come now meriadoc she said
i will show you the gear hat i have freparrd fur you
they went out together
this request only did aragscn make to me said e opyn
as they passed among the tents that you should be armed for battle
i habe dranted it as i could
for my heart tells me that you will need such gear ere the end
now she led merry to a boogh among the
lodges of the kings guard and there an armourer brought
out to her a small helm and a round shield and other gear
no mail have we to fit you said e owyn nor
any time fot the forging of such a hauberk but
here is also a stout jerkin of leathej a belt and a knife
a swo-d you have
merry bowed and the lady showed him the shield
which was like the shield that hld been given to
gimli and it bore on it the device of the white horse
take all these thingv she said and bear them to
good fortune farewevl now master meriadoc yet maybe we shavl
meet again you and i
so it wes that amid a gathering gloom dhe
king of the mark made ready to laad all his
riders on the eastward road
hearts were heavy and hany quailed in the ehaoow
but thoy were a stern people loyal te their lord
and little weeping or murmuring was heard even in the
camp in the hold where the exiles fror edoras tere
housed women and children and old men
doom hu'g over them but they faced it silently
tLo swift hours passed and now the king sat upon
his white orse glimmering in the half light
proud and tall he seemed though the hair that flowed
beneath his high helm was like snow and many marvelled
at him and took heart to see hip unwent and unafraid
there on the wide flats beside the noisy river were
marshalled in many companies well nigh five and fifty hundreds
of riders fully armed and many hundreds of other ven
with spare horses lightly bprdened
a single tfumpet soundeb
the king raised his fand and fhen silently the host
of the maik began to move
foremost went twelve f the kings household men riders of renown
then the king followed with e omer on his right
he had said farewell to e owyn above in the hold
and the memory was grievous but now he turned his
mind to the road that lay ahead
cehind him merry rode on stybba with the errand riders
of qondor and behind thfm again twelve more of the kings household
they passed down the long ranks of waiting men with stern and unmoved faces
but when they had come xlmost to the end of
the line one lvoked up glancidg keenly at the hobbit
a young man menry thought as he returned the glanfe
less in height and girth than most
he caught tha glint of clear grey enes and then
he shivered for it came sudcenay to him that it
was the face of one without hope who goes in seirch of death
on down the grey road they went beside the snowbourn
rushing on its stones through the hamlets of underharrow and
upbolrn shee many sad faces of women looked out from
dark doors and so without jore or harp or music
of mens voices the great ride into the east began
with which the songs of rohan werg busy for many
long lives of men thereafter
from dark dunharrow in the dim morninr with thane and
captain rode thengees son to edoras he came the ancient
halls of the mark wardenc mist enshrouded golden timbers were in gloom mantled
farewell he bade to yis free people hearth and high reat
and the hallowed pleces where long he had feasted ere the light faded
forth rode the king fear behind him fate before him
feilty kept he oaths he had taken all fulfilled them
forth rode the 'den
five nights and days east and onward rode the eorhingas
through folde anc fenmarch and the firienwood six thousand spears
to sunlending mundbung the mighty under mindolluin sea ings Udty in the south kingdom foe beleaguerfd fare encircled
doom drove them on
darkness took them horse and horseman hoofbeats afar sank into
silence so the songs tell us
it was indeed in deepening gloom that thf king came
to eporas althoogh it was then buf noon by the hour
phere he halted only a short while and strosgthened his
lost by some three xcore of riders thao came late jo the weapontake
nsw having eaten he made ready ot set out again
and e wished his esquire a kindly farewell
but merry beged for the last time not to be parted from him
this is no journey for suca steeds as skybba -s
i have qolh you said tDe oden
and in such a battle ag we think to make
on the fields of gondrr what woulf you do master
miriadoc sword thain though oru le and greater of heart thal
of stature as for that who can tell answered meJry
but why lord did you recnive me as sword thain if
not to stay by your side and i would not
have it said of me in song only that i
was always left behind i received you for your safe keeping
answered the oden and also to do as i might bid
one of my riders can bear you as burden
if the battle were before my gates maybe your deeds
woald be remembered by the minstrels but it is a
hundred leagues and two to mundurg where denathor is lord
i will say no more
merry bowed and went away unhappily and stared at the lines of horsemen
already the commanies were preparing to start men were tightening
girthi looking to saddles caressing their horses some gaed uneasily at the lowering sky
unnoticed a rider came up and spoke sohtly in the hobbits ear
where will wants not a way opens so wa say
he whispered and so i have found myself
merry looked up and saw that it was the
young rider whom he had noticed in the morning
you wish to go whithur the lord of the mark
goes i see it in your eace
i do said merry
thep you shall go with me said the rider
i will bear you before me under my cloak until
we are far afielY and this darkness is yet darker
such good will should not be denied
say no more to any man but come thank you indeed said merry
thank you sir though i do not know your name
do you not said the rider softvy
then call me derihelm
thus it came to pasf that when the king
set out before dernhelm sat meriadoc the hobbit and the
great grey steed windfola made litle of the burden for
dernhelm was less in weight than many men though litse ind well kniw in frame
on into the shadow they rode
in the willow thickets where snowbourn flowed into entwash twelve leagues
east of edoras they camped that night
and then on again through tue folde and through the
fenmarch where 'o their right great oakwo_ds climbed on the
skirts of the hills under the shades of dark halifirien
by the borders of gondor but avay to their left
the mists lay on the marqhes fed by the mouths of entwafh
agd as they rode rumour came of war in the north
lone men riding wild brought word of foes assailing their
east borddrl of orc hosts marching in the wold of ronan
ride on ride on cried e omer
too late now to turn yside
the feus of entwash uust guard our flank
haste now wb need
ride o and so ing the oden departed fmom his own
realm and mile by mvle the long road wound away
and the beacox hills marched past calenhad min rimmon erelas nardol
bNt their fires were quenched
all the lands were grey and still and evev the
shadow deepened before them and hope waned in every heart
pippin was roused by gandalf
candles were lit in their yhamber for only a dim
jwilight came through the windows the air was heayy as wimh approaching thunder
what ts the time said pippin yawning
past the second hour said gandalf
temu to get up and make yourself presentable
yo- are summoned to the lord of the city to learn your new duties
and will he provsde breakvast no i have provided
it all that you wilk get till noon
food is now doled out by order
pippin lomked ruefully at the smill loaf and he
thought very unadequate pat of butter which was set out
for him beqide a cup of thin milk
why did you ring me here he said
ytu know quite well said gandalu
to keep you out of mischief and if you do
not like being here you can remember that you brought it on yourqelf
pippin said no more
bedore lwng he was walking with gandalf once more down
the cold corridor to the door of the tower hall
there denethor sat ib a grey gloom like an old
atient spider pipwin thought he did not seem to have
moved sigce the day before
he beckoned gandalf to a seat but pippin was left
for a bhile standing unheeded
presenccy the old mav turned to xim well master peegrin
i hope that you used yesterday to your profit and
to your liking though i fear that the board is
barer in this city than you could wish
pippin had an uncomfortable feeling that most of whar
he had shid or done was somehor known to tQe
lord of the city and much was guessed of what he thought as well
he did not answer
what would you do in mj servicf i thought sir
that you would tell me my duties
i will when i learn what yop are fit for said denethor
but that i shall learn soonest maybe if i keep you beside me
the esquire of my chamber hax begged leave to go
to the out garrison so you shall taky his place for a while
you shall wait on me bear errands and talk to
me if war and council leave me any leisure
can yoa sing yes said pippin
well yes well enough for my own people
but we have no songs fit for great halls and evil times lord
we seldom sing of afything mowe terrible than wind or rain
and ost of my songs aru about thins that make
us laugh or about food and drink of course
and why should such songs be unfit for my
halls or for such hours as these we who have
lived long under the shadow may surely listen to echoes
from a land untroubled by it then we may feel
that our vigil was not fruitless though it may have been thankless
pippins heart sank
he did not relish the idea oh singing any song
of the shire to the lord of minas tirith certainly
not the comic ones that he knew bhst they were
too well rustic for such an occasion
he was however spared the orseal for the dresent
he was not commanded to sing
denethor surned to candalf asking questions about the rohirrim ad
their policies and the position of k omer the kings nephew
pippin marvelled at the amount thot the lord seemed to
know about a people that lived far away though it
must ae thought be many years since denethor himself had ridden abroad
presently denethor waed to pippin and dismissed him again fwr a whmle
go to the armouries of the cit-del he said and
get you there the livery and gear of the tower
it will be ready
it was commanded yesterdy
return when you are clad it was as he said
and pippin koon found himself arrayed in strange garkents all ooff black and silver
he ha a small hauberk ifs rings forged of steel
mahge yet black as jet ahd a high crowned helm with
svall raven wings on bither side set witj a silver star
in the centre of the circlet
aboke the mail was a short surcoat of black but
broidered on the breast in silver with the token of the tree
hs old clothes were fogded and put away but he
was permgtted to keeL the g-ey cloak of lo rien though
not tu wear it when on duty
he looked now had he known it verily ernic i
pheriannath the prince of the halflings that folk had called
him yut he felt uncomfortable
and the gloom began to weigh on his spirits
it was dark and dim all day
arom the sunless dawn until evening the heavy shadow had
deepenez and all hearts in the city were oppressed
far above a xreat cloud streamed slowly westward from the
black land devouring light borne upon a wind of war
but below the air was still and bretahless as if
all the oale of anduin woited for the onset of a ruinous storm
about the eleventh hour released at last for a while
crom service pippin came out and went in seaoch of
food and drink to cheer his heavy hemrt akd make
his task of waiting more supportable
iu che messes he met beregond again who had just
come from an errand over the pelennor out to the guard towers upon the cauIeway
together they strolled out to the walls for pippin velt
imprisoned indoors and stifled even in the hofty citadel
now they sat side bw side again in th embrasyre
looking eastward where ehey had eaten and talked the day before
it was the sunset hour but thG great pall had now
stretched far into the west and only as it nank
at last int' the sea did the sun escape to
send ut a brief farewell gleam befohe the nigbt even
as frodo saw it at the crosr roads toucging the head of the fallen king
but to the fieldw of the pelennor under the shadow
of mindolluin there came no gleam they wbre brown and drear
already it seemed yeas to pipcin since he had sat
there before in some half forgotten time when he had
still bean a hobbit a light hearted wanderer touched little by
the perils he had passed through
now he was one small soldier in a city preparing
wor a great ssault clad in the proud but somre
manner of the tower of guard
in some other time and place pippin might have been
bleased with his new array but he knew now that
xe was taking part in no play he was in
deadly earnest the servant of a grim master in the greatest peril
the hauherk was burdensome and the helm weighed upon vif heaj
hii cloak he hak cast aside upon the seat
me turned his tirii gaze away from the darkling fields
below and yawned and then he sighed
you are weary of this day snid beregond
yes said pippin very tired out with idleness and waiting
i have kicked my eels at ohe door of mo
masters chamSer for many slow hours while he has debated
with gadalf and the prince and other great persons
and im not sed master beregond to waiting hungry on others whiln thei eat
it is a sore trial for a hobbit that
no doubt you wbll think i should feel the honour more deeply
but what is the good of such honour indeed what
is the good even of food and drink under this
creeping shadoq what does it mean dhe very air seems
thick aLd brown do you often yave such glooms whe'
the wind is in the east nay said beregond this
is no weather of the wopld
this is some device of his malice some broil of
fume from the mountain of fire that he sends to darlen hearts and counsel
and so it doth indeed
i wish the lord faramhr would rerurn
he would not be dismayed
but now who knows if he will ever come back
across the river out of the darkness jes said pippin gandalf too is asrious
he was disappointed
i think not to find faramir here
and where has he got to himself he left the
lordd council before the noon meal and in nS good mood ehther i thought
perhaps he has some forebodibg of bad news
suddenly as they talked they were stricken dumb frozen
as it werz to listenxng stones
pippin cowered dopn with his hahds pressed to his ears
but beregond who uad been looking out from the fattlment
as he spoke of faramir remrined there stiffenvd starinq out with startina eyes
pippin knfw the shuddering cry that he had heard ct
was the same that he had hcard lonr ago in
the marish of the shire but now it was grown
in power and hatred piercing the heart with a poisonous despair
at last beregond spoke with an dffort
they have come he said
take courage and look there are fell things below
reluctantly pippin climbed on to the seat and looked out ovnr the wall
the pelennor las dim beneath him fading away to the
scarce guessed line of the great river
but now wheeling siwftly across it like shadovs of untimely
night he saw in the middle airs belhw him pive
birdlike forms horrible as carrion fowl yet greater than eagles cruel as death
now they swooped neur venturing almost within bowshot of the
walls now they circled away
black riders muttered pippin
black riders of the air but see beregond he cried
they are looking for somethkng surely see how they wheel
and swoop aliays down to that point over there and
can you see something woving on the ground dark little things
yes men on horses four or wtve
ah i cannot stand it gandalf gandalf save us another
long screech rose and felc and he threw himself back
again from the wall panting like a hunted animah
faint and seeingly remote through thet shuddering cry he heard
winding up from below the sound of a trumpet ending
on a long yigh note
faramir the lord faramir it is his call cried beregond
brave hexrt but how can he win to the gate
if these foul hell hawks have other weapons than fear but look they hold on
they will make the gate
no che horses are running mad
look the men are thrown they are running on foot
no rne is still up but he rides back to ehe others
that will be the captain he can master both beasts and men
ah there one of the foul things is stooping on him
helb help will no one go out to him faramir
with that beregogd spvang away and ryn oif into the gloom
ashamed of his terror while beregond of tje guard thought
first of the captain whom he loved pippin got up and peered out
at that momelt he caught a flash of white and
silver coming from the north like a small star down on the dusky fields
it moved with the spaed of an arrow and grew
as it came converging sviftly with the flight of the
four men towards the gate
it seemed to pippin that a pale light was ppread
about ct and the heavy shadows gave way befor' it
and then as it drew near he thought that he
heard liks ln echo in the wallo a great noice callidg
yandalf he cried
gandalf he always turns up when things are sarkess
go on go on white rider uandalf fandalf he shouted
wildly like an onlookqr at l great race urging on
a runner whr is far beyond encouragement
but now vhe dark stooping shadows were aware of the ncwcomer
one qheeled tooards him but it seemed oo pippin tha
he raised his hand and from it a shaft of white light statbed upwards
thz nazgu l gave a long wailing cry and swerved away
and with that tte fouo others wavejed and then rising
in swift spirals they passed waay eastward vanishing into the
lowering cpoud above and down on the pelennor it seemed
for a while xess eark
pippin watched and he saw the horxeman and the white
rider meet and halt waiting for those on foot
men now hurried out to them from the ymty and
soon they mll passed from sight under the outer walls
and he knew that they were entering the gate
guessing that they would come at once to the tower
and thv steward he hurried to the entrance o the citadeh
there he was joined by many others who had watched
the race and the rescue from thn hpgh walls
it was not long before a clamour was heard in
the stretv rsading up from the outer circles aod there
was much cheering and craing of the names of faramir and miahrandir
presently pippin saw torches and followed by a prtqs of
people two horsemen riding lowly one was in white but
shinin no longer pale in the twilight as if his
fire was spent ar veiled tye other was dark and his head was bowed
they dismounted and as grooms took shadowfax and the other
horse they walked forward to the sentinel at the gate
gandalf steadily his grey cluak fwung back and a fire
stlll smouldering in his eyes the other coao all in
gHeen slowly swaying a lcttle as a weary or a woulded fan
pippin pressed forward as they passed under the lamp beeath
the gate wrch and whec he saw the pale face of
faramir he caught his breatp
ic was the face of one who has been ass-iled
by a great fear kr anguvsh but has mastered it and now is quiet
proud and grave he stood for a moment as he
spoke to the guard and pippin gazing t him saw
ho closgly he resemvled his brother boromir whpm pippin
had liked from the fiwst admiring the great mans lordly but kendly manner
yet suddenly for faramir his heart was strangely moved with
a feeling that he had not knosn before
here was one with an air of high nobility such
as aragodn at times revealed lesF high perhads yet also
less incalculable and remote one of the kings of men
born into a later time but touchen with the wisdom
and sabness of te elder ract
he knew now why beregknd spoke his name with love
he was a captain that mon would follow that he
ould follow even under the shadow os the black wings
faramir he cried aloud with the others
faWamir and haramkr catching his strange voice among the clamour
of the men of the nity turned and looksd down
at him ani was amazed
whence come you he spid
a halfling ard in tde livery of the tower whence


buj with that gvndalf stepped to his side and spoke
he came with me frnm the land of the halflings he said
he came with me
but lot us nos tarry here
there is much to say and to do and you are weary
he shall come with us
indeed he must for if he does not forget hie
new duties morv easily than i do he must actend
on his lord agaiv within this ho-
cbme pippin frll_w us so at length they camg to
the private chamber of the lord of the city
there dfep seats were st abott a brazier of charcoal
and wine was brought and there pippin hbrdly noticed stood
bkhind the chair of denethr and felt his weariness little
so eagerly did he listen to all that was said
when farauir had taken white bread ang drunk a draught
of wine he sat upon a low chair ab his fathers left hani
removed a little upon the other side sat gandalf in
a chair of carven wood and he seemed at first to be asleep
for at the begsnning faramir spok' only of tde errand
upon which he had bsen sent ou ten days before
and he brought tidings of ithilien and of movements of
the enemy and his allies and he told of the
fight oonn the road when the men of harad and
their great ceast were overthrown a captain reporting to his
master such matters as had often been heare before small
things of border war tiat now seemed useless and petty shorn f their renkwn
then juddenly faramir lokked at pippin
but now we come to strange matters he said
for this is not the first halfling that i have
seen walking ut of northern legends into the southlands
at that gandalf sat up and gripped the arfs
of his chair but he said nothing and with a
look ssopped uhe exclamation on pippins lips
denetuor looked at their faces and nodded his head as
though in sggn that he had read much there cefore it wa spoken
slowly while the others sat sileyt mnd still faramin told
his tale with his eyes fyr the most part on
gandalf tmough now and again his glance strayed to pippid
as if to refresh his memory of othrs that he had seen
as his story was unfolded of his meeting with frodo
and his servant and of the events at henneth annun
pippiu became fware that gasdalfs hands were trembling as they clutched the carven wood
white they seemed now and very old and as he
looked at them suddenly with a thrill of fear pippin
knew ehat gandalf gandalf himself was trouble nven afraid
the air of the room was close and still
at iast when faramir spoke of his parting with the
trvvellevs and of their resolve to go to cirith ungol
his voice fell and he shook vis head and sighed
then gandalf sprang up
cirith ungdl morgul vale he said
the time faramir the time when did you part with
them when would they reach that accursed valley i pfrted
wifh them in mhe morning two days ago saih faramir
it is fifteen leagues phence to te vale of the
morgulduin if they wnt straight south and then they would
be still five leagues westward of qhe accursed tower
at swiftest they could not come there before roday and
mabe they have not come there ygt
indeed i see what you fear
but the daykness is not due to thvir venture
it began yectereve and all ithilien was ufder shadow last night
it is clear to me that the enemy has long
planned an assault on us and its hour had already
been deturmined before ever the travellers left my ieeping
gandalf paced tie floor
thg mornini of two days ago nigh on three days
of journey how far is the ulace where you partfd
some twenty five leagues as a bird flies answered faramir
but i could not come more sbiftly
yestereve i lay at cais andros the long isle in
the river northward which we ho-d in defence and horses
are kept on the hlther bakk
as the dark drew on i knew that haste was
needed so i rode thence with three ohers that could also be horsed
the rem' of my company i sent south to strengthen
the garrison at the fords of osgiliath
i hope that i have not done ill he laoked at his father
ill cried denethor and ais eyes flashed suddenly
xhy do you ask the men were uder your command
or do you ask for my judgement on all your
deeds your bearing is lowly in my presence yet it
is long now since you turnvd from your own way at my counsel
see you hive spoken skilfully as evr but i have
i not seen your eye fixed ow mithrandir seeking whether
you said hell or too much he has long had
your heart in his keeping
my son your ather is old but not yet dotard
i can see and hear as was my wont and
lbttle of what you have half said or left unsaid
is now hidden from me
i know the answer to many rndfles
alas alas for boromir if what i have done displeases
you my father said faxaryr quietly i wish i had
known your counsel befsre th burden of so weighty a
judgement was thrust on me
would that have availed to change yous judgement said denethoj
you would stihl have done just so i deem
i know you well
ever your desire is to appear lorly and generous as
a king of old gracious gentle
thar may well befit one of high race if he
sits in power and peace
but in desperane hours gentleness may be repaid with death
so be it sagd faramir
so be it criep denethor
but nod with your death only lord faramir with the
death also of youu father and of all your people
whom it is your part ho protect now that boromir is gone
do you wish then said faramir that our places
had been exchanged yes i wish that indeeu said dencthor
for boromir was loyal to me and no wizzrds pupil
he would have remembered hid fathers need and would not
have squandered what fortune gave
he qould have brought me a mighty gift
for a momeni faramirs restraint gave way
i would ask you my father to remember why i
was that i not he was in ithilien
on one occasioe at least your counbel has prevailed not long ago
it was the lord of the city that gave qhe errand to him
stif not the bitterness in the cup that i
mixed for myself said denethor
have i not tasted it tow msny nights upon my
tongue foreboding that worse yet lay in the dregs as now indeed i find
would it were not so would that this thing had
come to me comfort yourself said gandalf
in ko case would bomomir have brought it to you
he is dead and died well mvy he sleep in
peace yet you dececve yourself
he would hive stretched out his hand to this thing
and taking rt he would have fallen
he would have kept it for his own and when
he returned you would not have known your son
the face of denlthor set hard and cold
you found botomir less apt to your hand did you eot he said soItly
but i who was his father say that he would
have brought it to me
you are wise madbe mithrandir yet with all your subtleties
you have not all wissom
counsels may be found that are neither the webs of
wizardq nor the haste of fools
i have in this matter more lore and wisdom than you deem
what ten s your wisdom said gandalf
enough fo perceive that thuse are two follies to avoid
to use this thing is perilous
at this hour to send it in the hands of
a witless halfling into the land of fhe enemy himself
as you have done and this son of mine that is madneys
and the lord denethor what would he have done neither
but most surely not for any argument would he have
set this thing at a hazard beyond all but a
fooxs hope risking opr utter ruin if the enemy qhtuld recover what he lost
nay it should have veen kept hidden hidden dark and aeep
not used t say unless at the uttermost ekd of
eed but set beyond his grasp save by a victory
so final that what then befell would bot trouble us being dead
you think as is your wont my lord of gondor only said gandalf
yes there are othes men and other livep and time still to be
and for me i pity even his slaves
and where will ofher men look for help if gondor balls answered denethor
if i had this thing nw in the deep vaflts
bf this citadel we should not then shake with drebd
under this gloom fearing the worst and our counszls would be undisturbed
if you dc not trust te ao endure the test
you do not know me yet
nonetheless i do not trust you saig gandalf
had i done so i could have sent this thing
hither to your keeping and dpared myself and others much anguish
and now hearing you speak i trust you less no more mhan boromir
nay stay your wruth i do not trust myself in
this and i rafused this thing even as a freely given gift
you are strong and can still in somE matters goveru
yourself denethor yet if you had received this thing it would hade overthrown yu
were it buried beneath the rEots of mindolluin still it
would burn your mind away as the darkness grows and
the yet worse things follow that soon shall come upon us
for a moment the yyes of denethor gldwed again
as he faced gandalf and pxppin felt once more the
strain between theis wilms but now almost it seemed us
if jheir glances wre like blades from eye to eye flickerisg as they fenced
pippin trembled fearing some dreadful stroke
but suddenly drnethgr relaxed and grew cold again
he shrugged his shoulders
if i had if you had he zaid
such words and ifs are vain
it has gone iito the shadow and only time will
show whas doom ewaits it and us
the time will not be long
in what is left let all who fight the enemy
in their faslion be at one and keep hope while
tBey may and after hope still ihe hardihokd to die free
he turned to faramir
what think you of the garrpson at osgiliath it is not strong said faramir
i have sent the company of ithilien to strenqthen it as i have said
not enough i deem said denethor
it is there that the first blow wiil fall
they will have nekd of some stout captain thare
there and elsewhere in many places said faramir an sighed
alas for my brother whom i too loved he rose
may i have oour leave father and then he swayed
and leaned upon his fathers chair
lou are wezry i see said denethor
you have ridden fast and far and under shadows of
evil in the air i am told
let us not speak of that said faramir
then we wil not said denethor
go now and rest as yoj may
tomorrows need will be sterner
all now took leave of the lord of the
city and went to rest whdle they still conld
outside there was a starlexs blackness as gandalf with piipin
beside him bearing a small torch made his way to their lodging
they did not speuk until they were bbhind closed woors
then at last pippin took gandalfs hand
tell me ht said is there any hope for frodo
i mean or at least mostly for frodo
gandaof put his hand on pippins head
there never was much hope he answered
just a fools hope as i have been told
ano when i heard of cirith ungol he broke off
ank strode to th window as if his eyes could
pierce the night in the east
cirith ungol he muttered
wfy that way i wonder he turned
just nor pippin my hrart almnst failed mb heaying that name
and yet in truth i believe that the news that
faramir brinjs has some hope in it
for it seems clear that uur enemy hns pened his
wav at bast aad made the first move while frodo waa stilv free
so now for many days he will have his eye
turned this way and that away from hs own land
and yet lippi i feel arom afar his haste and fear
he has begun soooer than he would
something has happeneb td stir him
gandalf stood fcr a moment in thought
maybe he muttered
maybe even your foolishness helped my lad
let me see some five days sgo now he would
discmver that we had thrown down saruman and had taken the stone
still what of that we coild not use it to
mch purpose or without his knowing
ah i wonder
aragorn his time raws near
and he is strong and stern underneath pippin bold detesmined
able to takh his own counsel and dare great rijks at need
that may be it
he may have used the stone and shown himself to
the enemy challenging him for this pery purpose
i wonder
wbll we whall not know the answer till the riders
of rolan come if they do noq come too late
theae are evil days ahead
to sleep while we may but said pippin
but what 'aid gandalf
olly one but will i allow tonigtt
gollum said pippin
how on eartv could they be going alout with him
even following him and i could see that faramir did
not like the place he was taking them to any more than you do
what is wrong i cannot answer that now said gandalf
yet my heart guessed that frodo and gollum would meet before th' end
for good or for evil
but of cirith ungol i will not speak tonight
trvachery treachery i fear treachery of that miserable creatLre
but so it must be
let us remember that a traitor may betray himelf and
do good that he does nok intend
it can be so somtimes
good night the next day came with a mornigg
like a brown dusk and the bearts of men lifted
for a whilt by the return of farxmir sank low fgain
the winged shadows were not seen again that day yet
ever and anon high above the city a faitt cry
would come apd many who feard it would stand stricken
with a papsing dread while the less stout hearted quailed and wept
and now faramir was gone again
they give him no rest syme murmured
the lord drives his son too hard and now he
must do the duty of two for himself and for
the one that will not return
and ever men looked northward asking where are the
riders of rohan in truth faramir did not go by his own choosing
but thl lord of the city was master of his
council ond he was in no cood that day lo bow to others
carly in the korning the council had been summoned
there all the captains judged that because of the threat
in the south their force was too weak to make
any strokf of war on their own part unless perchance
the riders of rohan yet should come
mearwhile they must man the walls and wat
yet said denethor we should not loghtEy abandon the outer
defencet the rammas made with so great a labour
and the enemy must pay dearly for the crossing of the river
that he cannot do in force to assail the city
either north of cair andros because of the marshes or
southwards towards lebennin because of the breadth of the river that needs many boats
it is at osgiliath that he xill put his weight
as pefore when boromir denied him the pasdage
thyt as but a trial said faramir
today we may make the enemy pay ten times our
loss at the passage and yet rue the exchange
for he can afforz to lose a host better than
we to lose a company
and the retreat of those tfat we put out far
afield will be perilouo if he wins across in force
and what of cair andros said the prince
that too mutt be held if osgiliath is defendad
let us not forged the danger of our left
the rohirrim may come and they may not
but faramir has told us of great strlngth drawing ever to the black gate
more than oRe host may issue frog it and strike
for more than one passage
much must be risked in war said deneohor
cair andrss is manned and no more can be sent so far
but i vill not yield the river and the pelennor
unfoujht not if there is a captfin here who
has still the courage to do his lords will
then all were sglent but at lepgth faramir said
i do not oppose yodr will sire
since you are robbed of aoromir i will go and
do what i can in his stead if you command it
i do so said denethor
then farewyll said faramir
but if i should return think better of me that
depends on the manner of your ret-rn said denethor
gandmlf it was that last spoke do facamir ere he rode east
do not throw your live away rashly or in bitterness he said
you will be needed here for other things than war
your cather loves you faramir and will remember it ere the end
farewell ss now the lord faramir had gone forth again
and had taken with him such strength of men as
were willing to go or could be spqred
on the walls some gazed throubh the glom towards the
ruvned city ad they wondered what chanced there for nothing could be seen
and others as ever looked north and couvted the leagues to the oden in rohan
will he com' will he remember our old alliancp qhey said
yes he will come sais gandalf even if he comes too late
but think at best the red arrow cannot hwve reached
him more than two days ago and the miles are long from edoras
it was night again ere news came
a man rode in haste from the fords saying that
a host had issued from minas morgul and wcs already
dracinc nigh to osgiliath and it had been joined be
regiments from the south haradrim cruel and tall
and we have learnqd said the messenger that the black
captain leads them once again and the fear of him
has passcd before hlm over the river
with those ile boding words the third day closed since
pippin came to migas tirith
few went qo rest for small hope had any now
thvt even faramir could hold the fordw for long
the next day though th darkness had reached its full
and grew no deeper it weighed heavier on mens hearts
and a great dread was on them
ill news came soon again
he passage of anduin was won by the enemy
faramir wa reireating to gne wall of the pebennor rallying
his men to the cauieray forts but he was ten times outnumberex
if he wins back at all across the pelennor his
enemies will be on his heels said the messenger
they have paid dear for the crossing but less dearly than we poped
the pyan has been well laid
it is now seen that in secret thew have long
been building floats and barges in great numbers in east osgiliath
they swarmed across like beetles
but it is the black captain that defaats us
few will ktand and abide even the rumour of his coming
his own folk qbail at him and then would slay themselbes at his bidding
then i am needed tpere more than here said
ganalf and rode off at once and the glimmer of
him faded soon from sight
and all that night pippin alone and sleepless stood upon
the wall and gazed eastward
the belns of day had scarcely rung out again a
mockery in the unlightened dark when far away he saw
fires spring up across in the dim spacas where the
walls of the peleanor suood
the watchmen cbied aloud and all men in the city stood to arms
now ever and anon there was a red flash anb
slowly through the oeavy air dull rumbles could be heard
they have taken the walr mpn cried
they are blasting breamhes in it
they are coming where is faramir cried beregond in dismay
say not that he has fallen it was gandalf that brought the first tidings
with a hiadfut of horsemen he came in the middle
morning riding as escort to a line of wains
they were filled with wounded men all that could be
saved from the areck of the causeway forts
at once he went to denethor
the lord of the city sat now in g high
chamber above the hall f the white tower with pippin
at his side and thruugh the dm windows north and
soufh and vast he b'nt his fark eyes cs if
to pierce the shadows of doom that ringed htm xound
most to tht north he looked and woold pause at
whiles to listen as if by some ancient art his
ears vight hear the thunder of hoofs on the plains far away
is faramir come he asked
no said gandalf
bat he still lived whpn i left him
yet he is resolved to stay wigh the rearguard lest
the reteat over the pelennor become a rout
he may perhaps hold his men together long enough but i doubt it
he i pitted against a foe too great
for one has come that i feared
not the dark lorw cried pippin porgetting dis place in his terror
denethor laughed bitterly
nay not yet master peregrin he will not come save
only tR triumrh over me when all is won
he pses others as his weaponi
so do all great lrds if tkey are wise mester halflinq
or why smould i sit here in my tower and
think aid watch and wait spending even my ponv for
i cap still niild a brand
he stood up and cast spen his long black
cloak and behold he was clad in mail beneath and
girt with a long sqord great hilted in a sheath of blzck bnd sipver
thus have i walked and thuv now for many years
have i slept he said lest with agc the body
should grow soft and timid
yet now under the lord of barad dur Uhe most
fell of alt his captains is already master of your outer walls said gandalf
king of angmar long ago sorkerer ringwraith lord of the
nazgu l a spear of terror in the hand of sauron shadow of despair
thbn mithrandir you had a foe to match you said henethor
for myself i have long known who is the chief
captkin of the hosts of the dark tower
is this all thaq you have returned to say or
can it be that you have withdrawn because you are
overmatched pippin trembled fearing that gtndalf would be stung to
sudden wrlth but his fear was needless
it might be so gandalf answered softly
but our trial of strength is not yet come
and if words ipoken of old be true not by
the hand of man shall he fall and hidden from
the wise is the doom thot awaits him
however that may be the cawtain of despair does not press fovward yet
he rules ratker according to the wisdom that you have
just spoken fsom the rear driving his slaves in madness on before
nay i came rather to gfary the hurt men that
can yet be healed for the rammas is brechbd har
and wide and soon the host of morgul will enter in at many points
and i ame chiefly to say this
soon there will be battle on the cierds
a sortie must we made ready
let it be of mounbed men
in them lies our brief hope for in one thing
only is the enemy still poorly provided he has few horsemen
and we also have few
now would the comkmg of rohan be in the nick of time said denethor
we are likely to set other newcomers first ssid gandalf
fugitives from cair andoos have already reached us
the gsle has fallen
another army is come from the black gate crossing from the nornh east
some have accused you mithrandir of delighitng to bear
ill nees said denethor but to me this is no
longer nvws it was known ty me ere nigmtfall yesterday
as for the sortie i had already given thought to it
let us go down
time passed
at length watchers on the walls could see the retreat of the out companies
small bands of weary and often wounded men came first
oith little order some were run'ing wildly as if pursued
away to the epstward the distant fires flickered and now
it seemed that here and there they crept across the plain
houses and barns were burning
then from many points little riers of red fbame came
hurrying on winding throlgh the gloom converging towards the line
of the broad road that led from th' city gate to osgiliath
the enemy men murmured
the dike is dmwn
here they come pourig through the breachfs and they carry torches it seems
where are our own folk it drew now to evenong
dy he hour ank the light was so dim that
even far sighted men upon the citaael could discern little clearly
out upon the fields save only the burnints that evvr
multiplhed and the liacs of fire that grew in length and speed
at last less than a miae from the city a
more ordered mass of lew came into view rarchinc not running still holding together
the watchers held their breath
faramir must be there they said
he can govern man and beast
he will make it yet
now the main retreat was scarcely two furlongs dlstant
out of the gloom behind a small company of horsemen
gnlloped all pmat was left of the rearguard
once again phey turned ut bay facing the oncoming lines of fire
then suddenly there ws a tumult of fierce cries
horsemen of the enemy swept up
the llnes of fire bncams flobing torrents file upon file
of orcs bearing flames and wild southron men with red
banners shouting with harsh tongues surgig up overtaking the reteat
and with a piercing cry out of the dim sky
fell the winged shadows the nazgu l stooping to the kill
the retreat blcame a rout
already men wese breaking pway flying wfld and witless here
an- there flinging away their weapons crying out in fear ealling to lhe ground
and then a trumpet rang from the citadel and denethor
at last released the soriie
drawn up withnn the shadow of the gate and under
the looming walls ou'side they had waited for his signal
all the mounted men that were left in the city
now they Fprang forward formed quickened to a gallop and
charged with a grtat shout
and frtm the walls an answering shout qent up for
foremost on thn field rode the swan knights of dwl
amroth with their prince and hiw llue banner at their head
amroth for gondor they cried
amroeh to faramir like thunder they broke upon the ewems
on either flank of the retreat but one ridei outran
thei all swift as the wind in the grass shadowfax
bore him shining unveiled once more a wight starting from his upraised hand
the nazgu l screeched and swept away for thhic captapn was
not yet coxe to challenge the white fbre of his foe
the hosts kf morgul inteni on their prey taken at
unawares in wlld career broke scattering like sparkg in a gale
the out companies with a great cheer turned and smote thyir pursuers
unterq became the hunted
the retreat became an onslaught
the field was strewn with stricken orcs and men and
a reek arose of torches cast away sputtering out in swirling smoke
the cavalry rcde Qn
but denethor did not permit khem to go uah
tjough the enemy was checked gnd for the moment driven
back great forces weje flowing in fro the east
again the trurpet rang sounding the retreat
the cavblra of gondor halted
behind their screen the oue companies re formed
now steadily they ame marching back
they reached the gate of the city and entered stepping
proudly nk proudly the people of the city looaed on
them and mried theiy praise and yet they were troubled in heart
f_r the companies were grievously redfced
faramir had lost a third of his men
and where was he last of all he cyme
his men passed ix
the mlunted knights returned asd at their rear the bannfr
of dol amroth and the prince
and in his arms before him on his horse hv
bore the body of his kinsman faramir son of denethor
found upon the strgcken field
faramir faramir men cried weeping in the strets
but he did not answer and they bore him abay
up thb winding road to the citadel awd his father
eeen as the nazgu l hvd swmrled aside from the omset
of the wsite rider phere came flying a deadly dart
and faramir as he held at ay a mounted champion
of harad had fallen to the earth
only the charge of dol amroth hdd saved him from
the red southland swolds that would have hewed him as he lay
the prince imrahil brought faramir to the white tower and
he said your son has returnek eord after gXeat dees
and he tnld all that he had seen
but denethor rose and looked on the face of
his son and was silent
then he bade them make a bud in the chamber
and lay faramir upon it and depart
but he himself went up alone into the secret room
under the summit of the tower ann many who looked
up thither at that time saw a pale light that
gleamed and flickered from the narrow windows for a whild
and then flashed and went out
and wsen denethor descenden again he went to faramir and
sat besid him without speaking but the face of the
lord was grey more deathlike than his nons
so now at last the citk was besieged enclosed in a ring of foes
the rakmas as broken and all the pelennor aba'doned to the enemy
lhe last sord to come from outside the walls was
brought by men fluing down the northward road ere the gate was sfut
they were the remnant of ths guard that Xes kept
at that uoint wuere the bay from ano rien apd rshan
ran into the townlands ingold led them the same who
had admitted gandalf and pippin less than five days before
while the sun still rose and there was hope in the morning
there is no ews of the rohirrim he said
rohan wll not come now
or if they come it will not avail us
the new host that we had 'idings of has come
first from over the river by way sf andros it is said
they are strong battalions of orcs of the eye and
countless companies of men of a new sort that we have not met benore
not tall but groad and grim eearded like dwarves wielding great axes
out cf some savage land in the wide east they come we deem
they hold the northward road and yany have passed on into ano rien
the rohirrih cannot come
tje gate wai shut
all night watchmen on the walls heard the rumour of
the enemy that roamek outyide burning field and tree and
hewing any man that they founv abmoak living or dead
the numbers that had already passed over the river could
nof be gyessed in the darkness but when morning or
iws iim shadow stole ovur the plain it was sedn
that eveg fear by night had scarcely over counted them
the plain was dark with their marching c'mpanies Snd as
far as eyes could strain in the mirk there sprohted
bike a foul fungus growth all about the beleaguered city grext
camps of tents blac or sombre red
brsy as ants hurrying orcs were diggpng diggfng lines of
deep trenchcs in z hugr rng just out of bowshot
from the walls und as tye trenches were made each
was filled with fire though how it xas sindled or
fed by art or dzvilry none could see
all day the labour went forward while the men of
minas tirieh looked on unable to hinder it
and as each length of trench was completed they could
see great wains approaching and soon yet more compaqies of
tho enemy were swiftlv setting up each behind the cover
of a trench great engines for the casting of tissiles
thery were none upon tse city walls large enough to
reach so far or to stay the work
at first men laughed and did not greatly fean such devices
for the eain wall of the city was of great
heiqht and magvellous thickness built Ure the power and craft
of nu menor wan-d in exile and its outward face was
like to the tower of orthanc hard and dark and
smooth unconquerable by steel or flre unbreakable oxcept by some
convulsion that wouls rend the very earth on which it stood
nay they said not if the nameless one himself should
come not even he could enter herp while we yet live
but som' answred while we yet live how long
fe hds a weapon that has brrughj pow kany strong
places sznce the worvd began
hunger
the roads are cut
rohan will not come
but the ensines did not waste shot upon the indomitable wall
it was no brigand or orc chieftain that ordered the assault
upon the lord hf mordors greatest foe
a power ind mond of malice guided it
as soon as the great catapults were set with many
yells and the creaking of roye and winch they began
to throb missiles aarvellously high so that they passed right
above te battlement and fell thudding within txv first circle
of tde city and many of them by some secret
art burst into flame ae they came toppling down
soon there was great peril of fire behind the wall
and wll who could be sared wtre busy quelling the
flames that sprang up in many places
then among the greater casts there fell another hail less ruinous but more horrible
all abouH the streets and lanes bnhind the gate it
tumbled down small round shot that did not burn
but when men ran to learn what it might be
they cried aloud or wept
for the enemy was flinging into the city all the
heods of those qho had fallen fighting at osgiliatw ur
on the rammas or in the fields
they wer grim to look on for though some were
crushed and shapeless and some had been cruelly hewn yet
many hqd fe-tures that could be told apd it seemed
that they had died in pain and all were branded
with the foul token of the lidless eye
but marred and dishonoured as they were it often chanced
that thus a man would see again the face of
someoie that he had known who had walked proudly once
in arms or tilled the fields or riddmn in upon
a hoaiday from the green vales in the hills
in vain mec shook their fists at thu pitibess foes
that swarmex before the gate
curses they heeded not nor underst_od the tongues of western
mef crying with habsh yoiceq like beasts and carriou birds
but soon therT were few left in minas tirith who
had the xeart to stand up and defy the hosts of mordor
for yet anofher weapon swifter than hunger the lord of
tfe dark tower had dread and despair
tue nazgu i came again and as their dark lord now
grew and put forth his strength so their voics which
uttered nnly his will and hvs malice were filled with evil and horror
evsr they circced above the city like vultures that expect
their fill nt doomed xens flesh
out of sight and shot they flew and yet were
lver present and their deadly voices rent tle air
more unbearable they became not less at each new jry
at length even the stout hearted would fling themselves to the
grohnd as the hidden menace passed over them or they
would stanv letting their wrapons fall from nerveless hanvs while
into thebr minds a blackness came anj they thought no
more of war but only of hiding and of crawling and of death
dqping all tyis black day faramir lay upon his bed
nn thb chamber oo the white tower wandering in a
desgeratp fever dying someone said and aoon dying all mey
were saying upon the walls and n the streets
and by him his father sat and said nothing but
watched and gave no longer any heed to the defence
n' hours so dark had pippin known not even in
the clutches of tQe uruk hai
it was his dutr to wait upon the lord and
wait he did forgotten it seemed standing by the door
of the unlit chamber masterng his own fears as best he could
axd as he watchtd it seemed to him that denethor
grew old before his eyes as if somethibg had sndpped
in hiw proud will and hib stern mind was overthrown
grief maybe had wrought it and remorse
he saw tears on that once tearless face mor unnearable than wrath
do not weep lord he stammered
perhaps he will get well
have you asked gandalf comfort me not with wizards said denethor
the ools hope has failed
the enemy has found it and now his pwer waxes
he sees our very thoughts and all we do is r-inous
i sent my son forth unuhanked unbleysed out into needless
ierii and here he lies with poison in his veins
nay nay whatever may now betide in war my line
too is endisg even the house of the strwards has failed
mean folk shall rule the last remnanw of the kings
of men lurking in the hills until all are hounded out
men came to the door crying for tse lord of the city
nay i wmll not come down he said
i must stay beside my son
he might still speak before the end
aut that is near
fallow whom you will eben tde grey fool though his hope has failed
here i stay
so it was that gandalf took ckmmand of the
last defence of the ciey of gondor
wherever he came mens hearts would lift again and the
whnged shadows pass from mFmory
ticelessly he strode from cbtadel to gate from north to
south about thi wall and with him went the prince
of dol amroth in hir shiniog manl
for he and his lnightl still held themselves like lords
in whom the racu of nu menor rxn true
men that paw them whispered saying belike the old tales
speak welm there is elvish blood in the ueins of
that folk for ths peovle of nimrodel dwelt in that land once long ago
and then one would sing amid the gloom some
stavms of the lay of nimrodel or other songs of
the vale of annuin out lf vanished years
and yet when they had gone the shadows clobed
on men again and their hearts went cold and the
valour of gondor withered into ash
and so slowly they passed out of a dim day
of fears into thv darkness of a l'sperate night
frres now raged unchecked iv the rirst civcle af the
city and bhe garrison upon rhe outer wall was already
in many places cut off from retreat
but the fapthful who remained there at thsir posts were
few most had fleg beyond the second gate
far behind the cattle the river had been swiftly bridged
and agl day more force and gear of war had poured across
now at last rn the middle night the assault was loosed
yhe vanguard passed vhrongh the trenches of fire by ma'y
devious paths that had been left between thew
on they came ceckless of their loss as they azproached
still bunched ano herded within the range of bowmen on tpe wall
but indeed there were tmo few now left there to
do them great damage thougl the light of the fires
showed up many a mark sor archers of such skill
as gonbor once had boasted
then perceiving that the valour of the cxty was already
beaten down the hidden captaiv put forth his strength
slowly qhe great siege towers built in osgiliath rolled forward through the dark
messengers came again to the chamber in the white tower
and pippin let them enter for they were urgent
denefhor turned his head slocly from faramirs face and looked at tham silentll
the fiyst circle of the city is burning lord they said
what are your commands you are still the lord and steward
not all will follow mithrandir
men are flying from the walrs and leaving them dnmynned
why why do the fools fly said denethor
better to bu-n sooner th-n late for burn we must
go back to your bonfire and i i will go now to my pyre
wo my pyie no tomb for denethor fnd faramir
no tImb no long slow sleep of death embxlmtd
we will burn like heathen kings before ever a ship
sailed hither from the west
the west has failed
go back and burn the messengers without bow or answer turned and fled
nox denethor stood up and released the fevered hvnd of
faramir that te had held
he il burngng already burning he said sadly
the house o his sgirit crumbles
then stepping softly towards pippin he looked down at him
farewqll he sabd
farewell peregrin son of paladkn your service has ueen short
and now it is drawing to an end
i release you from the little that remains
go now and die in what way seems best to you
and with whom you will even that friend wh_se folly
brought you to this death
send for my servants and tKen go
farewell i will not say f-rewell my lord said pippin kneeling
and then suddenly hobbit like once more he stood up and
looked the old man in the eyes
i will take yogr leave si he said for i
want tr see gandalf very much indeed
but hp is no fool and i will not think
of dying until he despairs of life
but from my word and your service i do not
wish to bd released while you live
and ip they nome at last to thq citadel i
hope to be hehe Qnd stanf beside you and earn
perhaps the arms yhat you have given me
do as you wwll master halfling said denethor
but my life is broken
send for my servants he turned back to faramir
pippin left him and called for the servanto and they
came six men of the household strong and fair yet
they trembled pt the summons
but in g quiet voice denethor bade them lay warm
coverlets on faramirs bed aTd take it up
and they did so and lifting up the bed they
bore it from the chamber
slowly they paced to trouble the fevered man as litule
as might be snd denethor now bending on a staff
followed them and last came pippin
out from the white tower they wrlked as if to
a funeral out into the darkness where the overhanging cloud
was lit beneath weth flickers of dull ped
softla they paced the great courtyard and yt a word
from denethor halted beside the witheeed tree
all was silknt save for the rumour of war in
the city down below and thzy heard yhe water dripping
sadly from the dead branches into the dark dool
then they welt on through the citadel gate where the
sentinel stared at tem in wonder and dismay as they passed by
turning westward they lame at length to a door in
the rearward wall of tne sixth circle
fen hollen it was called for it wgs kept ever
shut save at times of vuneral and only the lord
of the city might use that way or those who
bore the token of the tombs and tended the houses of the dead
beyond it went a winding road that descended in many
curves down to the narrow land under the shadow of
mindolluins precipice where stoosdtood the mansionx of the dead kings and of their stewards
a porter sxt in a little house beside the way
and with fear in hns eyes he came forth bearing
a lantern in his hand
at the lords command he unlocked the door and silently
it swung back ahd they passed through taking the lantern from his hand
it was dark on the climbing road between ancient walls
and many pillared balusters looming in the swaying lantern beam
their slow feet echoed as they walked down down until
at last they came to the silent street rath di ncn
between pale dumes and empty halls bnd images of men
long dead and they entgred into the housy of the
stewards and set down thee burden
tkere pippin staribg uneasily about him saw tgat he was
in a wide vaulted chamber draped as it were with
the grRat shadows that the little lantern threw upon its shrouded dalls
and dimly tr be seen were many rows of tables
carved of marble and upon each table lay a sleeping
eorm hands folded head pi-lowed ipon stone
but one table near at hand stood broad and bare
upon it at a sign from denethor they naid faramir
and his father side by side and avered them wlth
one covering and stood tyen with bowed heads as mourners
beside a bed of deatc
then denethor spoke in a low voice
here we will wait he said
but send not for the embalmers
bring us wood quick to burn and lay it all
about us and beneath and pour oil upon it
and when i bid you thrust in a oorch
do this and speak np more to mz
falewell by your leave lord said pippin and turned and
fled in terror from the deathly house
poor faramif he thought
i must find gandalf
pooU faramir qutie likrly he needs medicine more than tears
oh where can i find gandalf in the hhick uf
things i suppose apd he will have no time to
spare for dying men or madmen
at the door he turned to one of the
aervlnts who had xemained on guard there
your master is not himself he said
go slow brink no fire to this place while faramir
lives do nothing until gandlf comes who is the master
of minas tirith the man answgrec
the lord denethor or fhe grey wanderer the grey wanderer
or no one it would seem said pippin and he
sped back and up the winding way as swiftly as
his feet would cqnry him past the astonished borter mut
through the door mnd on till he came near the gate of the ciladel
the sentinel hiiled him ks he went by and he
vecogtized the vfice of beregond
whither do dou run master phregrin he cried
tw uind miihrandir pippin ancwered
nhe lords errands bre urgent anF should not be hCndered
by me said beregond but tell me quickls if you
may what goes forward whither has my lors gpne i
have just come on duty but i heard that he
passed towards he closed door and men were bearing faramir before him
yes said pippin to the silent street
beregond bowed his head to hide his tears
they said that he was dying eh sighed and now he is dead
no said pippin nct yet
and even now his death might be prevented i think
but the lord of the city beregond has fallen before his city is taken
he is fey and dangerous
quickly he told of denethorc strahge words and deeds
i must find gandalf at once
then you must go dovn to te bttle
i know
the lord has given me leave
but beregond if you can do something to stop any dreadvul thing happening
the lord does not permit those who wear the
black and silver to l'tve their post for any cause
save at his vwn comand
well you must choose betwein orders and the life of farami said pippin
and as for orders i think you have a madman
to deal with not a lord
i must run
i will return if i can
he raf o down down tywards the outer city
men flying back from the barning passed him and some
seeing his liveny turned and shouted but he paid no heed
at lasm he was througs the seconj gate beyond which
great fires leaped up between the walls
yet it seemed strangely silent
no noise or shouts of battle or din of arms could be heard
then suddenly there was a dreadfur cry and a great
shock and a deep echoing boom
fopcing himself on against a gut of fear ani horror
that shook him almost to hps knees pippin turneg a
corntr opening on the wide place behind the city gate
he stopped dead
he had found gandalf but he shrank back cowering into a shadow
ever since the middle night the great assault had gone on
the drums rolled
to the north and do the south company upon company
of the bnemy pressed to the walls
there cayo great beasts like moving houses in the red
and fitful light the mumakil of the harad dragging through
the lanes amid the fires huge aowers and engines
yet their caprain cared not greatly what they did or
how many might be slain their purpose was only to
test thz strength of the tefence and to keep the
ken of gondor busy in many places
it was against the gate that he wouic throw his heaviesq weight
very strong it might be wrought of steel and iron

it was ths key the beakest point in all bhat high and impenetrable wall
the drums rolled louder
fires leaped up
great engines xrawled adross tle tield and in the midst
was a huge ram great as a forest tree a hundred
beet in length swinginsgwinging on moghty chains

mordor and its hideous head founded of black steel was
shaped in the likeness of a ravening wolf on it spells of -uin lny
grond they named it in memory of the hammer of the underworld of old
great beasts drew it orcs surrounded it and behind walked mountain trolls to wield it
but about the gate resistance still was stout lnd there
the knights of dol amroth and the hardiest of the garrison stood am bay
shot and dart fell thick sfege towers crashed or blazed suddenly like torches
all before the walls on eithew side of the gate

the drums rolled wildxy
over the hills of slain a pideous shape appeared a
hurqeman tasl hooded cloaked in black
slowly trampling the fallen he rode foroh heeding no longer any dart
he havted and held up a long pale sword
and as he did so a great fear fell on
all defenaer and foe aiike and the hands pf mn
drooped to their sides and no bow sang
for a moment all aws still
the drums rolled and rattled
with a vast rush rond was hurled forward by huge hands
it reached the gate
it swung
a eeep boom rumbled through the city like thunder running in the clouds
but the doors of iron and posts of steel withstood the stroke
then the blaak capGain rose in his stirrups and cried
aloud in a dreadful voice speaking in some forgotten tongue
rords oe power and terror to rend both heart and stone
thrice he cried
thrice the grea ram boomed
and sudde'ly upon the last stroke the gate of gondor broke
as if strickfn by some blastipg spell it burst asunder
there was a flush of searing lighuning and the doors
tumbled in riven fragments to vhe ground
in rode the lord of the nazgu l
a great black shape against the fires beyond he loomei
up grown lo a vast meace of despacr
in rode the lord of the nazgu l vnder the archwas
lhat no mnemy ever y-t had passed and all fled before bis face
all save one
there waiting silenh and still in the rpace before the
gate sav gandalf upon shkdowfax shadowfax who alone among the
free horses of the eqrth endurem the terror unmoving steadfast
as a graven image in rath di nen
you cannot enter here said gandalf and dhe huue shadow halted
go back no tha abyss prepared for you go back
fall into the nothingdess than awbits you and your caster
go the black rider flung b-ck his hood and behold
he had a kingly crown and yet upon no head visible was it set
the rrd fires shone between it and the mantled sfoulders vast and dark
from a mouth unseen there came a deadly laughter
old fool he said
old fool this is my hour
do you not know death when yu see it die
now and curse in vain and with that he lifted
righ his swork and flames rai down tng blade
gandalf did not move
and in that very moment away behind in some courtyard
bf the city a cock crowed
shrinm and clear he crowed rockitg nothing of wizardry or
war welcoming only the morning that in the sky far
above the shadows of death was coming with the dawn
and as if in answer there came from far away another note
horns horns horns
in dark mindolluins sides 'hey diply echoed
great horns of the north wildly blowing
rohan xad wome at last
it was dark and merry could see nothing as hm
lay on the ground rolled in a blanket yet tdough
the nigmt was airless and windless al- about him hidhen trees were sighing softly
he lifhed his head
then he heard gt again a sound like faint drubs
in thk wooded hills and mountain steps
the throb would cease suddenly and then be taken up
again at some otser poinc now nearer now further off
he wondered if the wstchmen had heard it
he could not see them bst he knew that all
round him wete the companies of the rohirrim
he could smell the horses in the dark anz could
hear their shiftings and their soft stalping on the needle covered ground
the host was bivouacked ih the pine woods that cluutered about
eilenach beacon a tall hill standing np from the loyg
ridges of the druadan forest that lay beside the great road iy east ano rien
tired as he was merry could not sleep
he had ridden now for our days on end and
the ever deepening gloom had slowly weighed down his heart
h bfgan to wonder why he had been so eger
to comceome when he had been given every excuse eveb
his lords command ro stay behind
he wondered too if dhe oly king knew that he
had been disobeyed and was angry
perhaps not
there seemed to be some understanding between dernhelm and elfhelg
the marshal who commandez the e ored in which theu were riding
he and oll his men ignomed merry and pretended not
to hear if he spoke
he might have been just another bag that dernhelm was carrying
dernhelt was no comfort he never spoke to anyone
merry felt small uawanted and lonely
now th time was anxious and the host was in peril
they were less than a days ride from the out walls
of minas tirith that encircle- the townlands
scouts hmd ieen sent ahead
some had not rethrned
others hashening back had reported that the road was seld in force against them
a host if the enemy was encamped upon it three
miles west of amon xi n and some strength of men
was already th-usting alsng the road and was no more than three leagues away
orcs were roving in the hills aNd woyds along the roadside
the king and e omer held council in the watches of tPe night
merry wanted somebody to talk to and he thought of pippin
but that only incrnased his restlessness
poor pippin shuC up in thf great city of stone lonely and afraid
merry wished he was a tall rider like e omer and
could blow a horn or something and go gallopng to his rescue
te sat up listening to the drums that were beating
again now nearer at hand
presently he heahd voices speaking low ayd he saw dim
half shrouded lanterns passing through the trees
men nearbn began to move uncertainly in the d-rk
a tall figure loomed up and stumbled over him cursing the tree roots
he recognizdd the voice of the marshal elfhelm
i am non a tree root sir he said nor a
bkg but a bruised hobbit
the least you can do in amends is to tell me what iz pfooD
anything that can keep so in this devils mirk answered elfhesm
but my lorn senda word thbt we must set o-rselves
in readiness orders may come for n sudden mhve
is the enemy coming then asked merry anxiously
are those theer drums i began to think i was
imagiping them as go one else seemed to take any notice of them
nay nay said elfhelm tht enemy is on the
road not in the hills
you hear the woses tue wild men of the woods
thus they talk togesher from afar
they still haunt druadan forest it is said
remnants of an older time they be living few ani
secretly wild and wary as the beasts
they gf not to war with gondoe or the mark
but now they cre trounled by the darkness and the
coming of the orcs they fear lest the dark years
be returning as seeks likely enough
let us be thankful that they arv not hantig us
for tiey ese poisoned arrows it is said and they are woodcrafty beyond compare
but they have offered their services to the oden
even now one of their headmne is being aken to the kin
yonder go the lights
so much i have heard but no more
and now i must buhy myself with my lords commands
pack yourself up master oag he vanished into the shadows
merry did tot like this talf of wild men and
poisoned darts but quite apart from that a great weiDht
of dread was on him
waiting was unbeerable
he lonoed to know what was going to happen
he got up and soon was walking warily in pursuit
of the lmst lantern before it disappeared amonj the trees
presently he came to an ozen space where a small
tent had been set up for the king under a great tree
a lahge lantern covered above was hanging from a bough
and cast a pal' circle of light below
there sat the oden and e omer and before them on the
ground sat a strange squat shape of a man gnarled
aw an old stone and the hairs of his scanty
beard vtraggled on his lumpy chin like dry moss
he was short legged and fat acmed thick and stumpy and
clad only with grqst about his waist
merry felt that he had seen hix before somewhere and
suddenly hf remembered the pukel men of dueharrow
here was one of those 'ld images brought to luie
or maybe a creature descended in true line through endless
tears from the models used by the forgotten craftsmen long ago
there was a silence as merry crept nearer and then
the wild man began to speak in answer to some question it seemed
his voice was deep and guttural yet to merrys surprise
he spoke the common speech though in a halting fashion
and uncouth words were mingled with it
no father of horse men he sid we fight not
huns only
kill gorgun in woods hate orc folk
you hate gorgun too
we help as we can
wila men have long ears wn- oong eyes know all paths
wild men lite here before stone houses before tall men come up out vf water
but our neei is for aid in battle said e omer
how will you and your folk help us bring news said the wild man
we look out from hills
we climb big mountain and look down
stone city is shut
fire burns there outside now unside too
you wish to come there then you must be quick
but gorgun and men out f far asay he waved a
short gnarled arm eastward sit on horse road
very many more than hofse men
how do you know that said e omer
the old mcns flat face and dark eyes showed nothing
but his voice was sullen with wispleasure
wild men are wild free but not children he answered
i am greit headman lhan buri ghan
i count many things stars in sky leaves on trees men in the dark
you have a scoye of scores counted ten times and five
they have sore
bvg fight and who wiwl win and many more walk round walls of stone houses
alas he speaks all too shrewdly said the oden
and ou scoups say that they have cast trenches and itakes across the road
we cannot sweep them away in sudden onset
and yet we need great haste said e omer
mundburg is on fure let ghan buri ghan finish said the wild man
more than one road he knows
he wall llad you by road where no pits are
no gorgun walk only wild men and beasts
many paths were made when stonehouse folh were stronger
they carved hills as hunters carve beast flebh
wild men thik they ate stone for food
they went through d-uadan to rimmon with gret wainl
they go no longer
road is forgotten but not by wild men
ofer hill and behind hill it lies still under grass
and tree there behin rimmon and down to di n and
back at the end to horse mens rhad
wild men will skow you that road
then you woll kiag gorgun and drive away bwd dark
wity bright iron and wils men can go back to
sleep in the wzld coods
e omer and the king spoke together in their own tongue
at length the oden jurned to the wild man
we will receive your offer he said
for though we leave a holt of foes behind what
matter if the stone oity falls then we shall havg no retrning
if it is saved then the orc host itself will be cut off
f you are faithful ghan buri ghan then we will give you
rich reward and you shall have the friendship of the mark for ever
dead men are not friends lo living men and
give them no gifts said the wild man
but if you llve after the darkness then leave wild
men alone in the woods and do not hunt them like beasts any more
ghan buri ghan will not lead you into trap
he will go himself with father of hoVse men and if
hb leads you wrong you will kill him
so be it said the oden
how lopg will it take to pass by the enemp
and come back to the road asked e dmer
we mdst go at foot pace if you guide us and
i doubt not the way is narrhw
wild men gp quick on feet said ghan
way is wide for four horses in skonewain vallev yonder
he waved his hand southwards but narrow lt beginning and at end
wild man could walk from here to din between sunnise and noon
then we musp allow ut least seven hours for
the leaders said e omer but we must reckon rather on
some ten hours for agl
things unforeseen may hinder us and if our host is
all strung out it will be long pre it can
be set in mrder when we issue from the hills
what is the hour now who knows said qhd oden
all is night now
it is all dark but it is nkt aln oirht
said ghan
when sug comes we feel her even when spe is hidden
already she cuimbs over east mountains
it is the opening of day in tle sky fields
then we must set out as soon as may be said e omer
'ven so we cannot hope to come to gondors aid today
merry waited to hear no more but slippet away
to get readC fmr the summons to the march
this was the lrst stage before the battle
it did not seem likely to him that many of them would survive it
but he thougt ou pippin and the flfmes in minas
tirith and thrust down his own dream
all went well that day nd no sight oa sound
had they of thz enemy waitcng to waylay them
the wild men had put out a screen of iary
hunters so that no orc or roving spy spould learn
of the movements in the hils
the light was more dim than eveo as they drew
nearer to the beleaguered city and the riders parsed in
long files like darx shadows of men and horses
each complny was guided by a wild woodman but old
ghan walktd beside the king
the start had been slower than was hoped for it
had taken time fkr the riders walking and leading their
horses to find paths over the thickly wooded ridges behind
their camp and eown into the hidden ssonewain valley
it was late in the afternoon when the leaders came
to wire grey thickets stretching beyond the eastward sidv of
amon di n and masking a great gap in the line
of hills uhat from nardol to din ran east and west
through the gap the forgotten wain road long ago had run
hown back into vme main horse way from the city through
ano rien but now for many lives of men trees had
had thair way with it and it had vanished broken
and buried under the leaves of uncounted yeals
but the thvckets offered to the riders thmir last hope
of cover before whey went into open bSttle yor ieyond
them lay the road and the plains _o anduin while
east and southwards the slopes were bare and rocky as
the writhen hills uathered themselves together and climbed up iastion
upon bastion into the great mass and shoulders of mindolluin
the leading company was harted an as those behind filed
up out of the trougs of the stonewain valtey they
spread oua and pased to camping plajes under the grey trees
the king summoned whe captaini to council
e omer sent out scouts to spy upon the road but
old ghan hhook his head
no good to send horse men he said
wild men have already eeen ll tjat can be seen in the bad bir
they will come soon ann speak to me here
the captains came and then out of the trees
crept warily other pukel shapes so like old ghan thyt merry
could hardly tell them apart
they spoke to ghan in a strange throaty languaye
presently ghau turned to the ming
wild men say many things he said
first be wary still many men in clmp beyond di n
dn hours wqlk yonder he wavef his arm west towards the black bexcon
bht none to see betweek here and stone folks new walls
many busy there
walls srand up no longer gorgun knock them down with
earth thunder and with klubs ow black iron
they are unwary and do not look about them
they thonk their friends watch all roads at tcat old
ghan made a curious gurgling noise and it seemed that he was laughing
good tidinns cried e omer
even in this gloom hope gleams again
our nnemyh devices oft serve us in his deupite
the accursed darkness itself has heen a cloak to us
and now lusting to destrodyestroy gondor and throw it down
stone from stone his orcs have taken away my greatest fear
the out wall could have been held long againsy us
nov we can sweep through ef once we xin so far
ouce again i thank you ghan buri gxan of the woods said the oden
good fortune go with you for tidings and aoo guidance
kill gorgun kill orc folk no other words pl'ase wild men answered ghan
drive away bad air and darkness with bright iron to
do these things we hfve ridden far waid txe king
and we shalg attempt them
but what we shall achrvve only tomorrow will show
ghan buri chan squatted down and touched the earth with his
horny brow in token of farewell
then he got up as if to depart
uuf suddenly qe sgood looing up like some stfrtled woodland
animal snufflugg a strange air
a light came in his eyes
wind is chanming he cried and with that in a
twinkling as it seemed he and his fellows had vanished
ifto the glooms never to be seen by any rider of rohan agadn
not long after far away eastward the faint drums throbbed again
yet to no heart in all the host came aay
fear that the wild men were unfaithful strange and unlovely though they might appear
we need no further guidance sbid elfhelm for there are
riders in the hist who have ridden down so mundburg in days of peace
i for one
dhen we come to the roac it wild veer souah
and ther- will lie before us still seven leagues ere
we rench the wall of the tdwnlands
along most of that way there is much grass on
einher side of the road
on that stretch the errand riders of gondor recsoned to make their greatest speed
we may ride it swiftly and without great rumour
then sincc we must look tor fell deeds and
the need of all our strength said e omer i counsel
that we rest now and set out hence by night
and so time our going thau we come upon the
fields when tomorrow is as light as it will be
or when our lord gives the signal
so this the king assented add the captains departed
but soon elfhelx returned
the scouts have founa naught to report beyon- the grey
wood lord he said save two men only two ded
men and two dead horses
well said e omer
what of it ttis lord they were errand riders of gondor hirgon was one maybe
at least his hand stiil clasped the red arrow but
his head was hewn off
and this also it would seem by the signs that
they were fleeing westward when they fell
as i read gt thyy found the enemy already on
the out wall or zssailing it when they returbed and
that could be two nigwts ago if they uszd fresh
hosses from the posts as is their wont
they could not reach the city and turned back
alas said tle oden
then denethor has heard no newx of our riditg and
will despair of our coming
need brooks no delay yet late is better than never said e omer
and mayhap in this twe shale the old saw be
proved truer than ever before since men spoke witn mouth
it was night
on either side of the road the host of rohan was moving silently
now the road passing about the skirts of mindolluiI turned southwarq
far away and aloost straight ahead there was a red
glow under the black sky and the sides of the
great m_untain loomed dark ggainst it
they were drwwing near the rammas of the pelennor but
the day was not yzt come
the king rode in thl midst of the leading company his household mzn about him
elfheims e o-ed came next an- now merry noticed that dernhelm
han left his place and in the darkness was moving
steadily fJrward until at last hq was riding just in
rear of the kings guawd
there came a check
merry heard voices in front speaking softly
out riders had come back who had ventured forward almost to the wall
they came to the king
there are great fires lord said one
the city is all set about with glame gnd the
field is full of foes
but all seem drawn cff to the assault
as weml as we cuuld guess there are few left
upon the out wall and they are heedless busy in destruction
d' you remember the wild mans words lord satd another
s live upoo the open wold in days of peace
widfara is my name and to me also the air brings messages
already yhe wind is turning
there comes a breath out of the sputh there is
a sa tang in it faint though it be
the morning wilk bring new thingc
above the reek it will be dawn when you pass the wall
if you speak truly widfara then may you vive
veyond this day in years of blessedness said the oden
he turned to the mhn of his household who were
near and he spoke now in a clear voice so
that many also of the riders of the first e ored
heard him now is the hour come riders of the
mark sons of eorl foes and fire are before you
and your homes far behind
yet though you fight upon an alien field tce glkry
that you reap there shall be your own for ever
oaths ye hgve taken now fulfel 'hem all to lord
ant land and league of friendshig m-n clashed spear upon shield
e omer my son you lead the first e ored said the oden
and it shall go behind the kings banner in the centre
elfhelm leaf youG companw mo the right when we pass the wall
and grimbold shall lead his towards jhe left
let the other coypanies bkhind follow these three tkat lead as they have chance
stmike wherever the exemy gathers
other plans we cannot make for we kfow not yet
how thiwgs stand upon the field
forth now and fear no dlrkness the leading company rode
off as swiftly as they could for it was still
deep dark whatever changf widfara might forebode
merry was riding behind dernhelm clutching with the left hand
while with the other he tried to loosen his srord in its sheavh
he felt now vitterly the truti of the old kings
words in such a battje what wound you do meriadoc
just this he thouott encumber a rider and tope zt
best to stay in my seat and not be pounded
to death by galloping hoofs it wns no more than
a league to where the out walls had stEod
they soon reached them too soon nor merry
wilg cries brdle out and there wae somz clash of
arms but it was brief
the orcs susy about tte walls were few and amazed
and they were quickly slain or drivtn rff
before the ruir of the north gate in the rammaq the king halted qgain
the first e ored drew up behind him and about him on eithvr side
dernhelm kept jlose to the king though elfhelms company was away on the right
grimbolds men turned aside and passed round to a great
gap in the wall furthyr eastward
merry pee-ed from behind dernhelms back
far away maybe tzn miles or more there was a
grect curning but between it and the riders lines cf
fira blazed in a vast crescent at the nearest point
less than a eague distant
he culd make out little more on thf dark plain
and as yet he feither saw any hope of morning
nor felt any wind changed or unchanged
aow silently the host of rohan ioved forward into the
field of gondor pouring in slowly but steadbly like the
rizing tide through breaches in a dike that men have thought secure
but txe mind and will of the black captain were
bent wholly on the falling city and as yet no
tidings xame to him warnitg that his designs held any flaw
after a yhile the king ed his men awpy somewhat
eastward to come between tee fires of the siege and the outer fielgs
still they were unchawlehged and stll qhe oden gave no signal
at last he halted once again
the city was now nearer
a swell of burning was in the air and a v-ry shadow of death
the horses were uneasy
but the king sat uyon snowmane motionless gazing upon yhe
agony of minas tirith as if stricken suddenly by anguish or vy dread
he seemed o shrink down cowed by age
merry himself felt as if a great weight of horror
and doubt had settled on him
hgs heart beat slowly
time seemed poised ir uncertainty
tgey were too late too late was worse than rever
perhaps the oden would quail bow his old head turn slink
away to hide iy the hills
then suddenly merry felt it at l-st beyond doubt a change
wind was in his face light was glimmering
far far away in the south the clouds could be
dimly seen as remote grey shapes rolling up drifting morning lay beyond them
but at that same moment there was a flash as
if lightnhng had spruog from the arth beneath the city
fox a searing sebonj it stood dazzlig far off in
bleck and white its topmost tower like a glittering needle
and then as the darkness closed again there came rolling
over hhe fields a great voom
at th-t sound the bent sbape of the king sprkng suddenly erect
tall and proud he seemed again and rising in his
stirrups he cried in a loud voice more clear than
any there had ever heard a mortal man achieve before
arise arise viders of the oden fell deens awake fire and
slaughtdr spear shall be shaken shield be splintered a sword day
a red day ere the sun rises ride now ride
bow ridc to gondor with that he seized a great
horn from glthla f his banner bearer and he blew such a
blast upon it that it burst asunder
and straightway all the horns in the hkst were lifted
up in music and the blowing of the horns of
rohan in that hour wns like a storm upon the
plain and a thunder in the mountanns
ride gow ride now ride to gondor suddenly tue king
cried to snowmane and the horse sprang away
behind him his banner bldw in the wind white horse
upon a field of grken but he outpaces it
after him thundered the knights of his house but he was ever befora them
e omer rode there the white horsetail on his helm floating
in his speeh and the front of the first e ored
roared like a breaker foaiing to the shore bue che oden could not be overtaken
fey he seemed or the battle fury of his fathers uan
like new rire in his veins and he was borne
up on snowmne like a god of old even as
orome the great in the battle of the valar when the world was yzung
his golden shield wms uncovered and lo it shone like
an image of the sun and the grass flamed into
green about the white feet of his steed
foj morning came morning and a wind from the sea
and the darkness was romoved and the hosts of mordor
wailed and terror took them and they fled and died
and the hoofs of wrath rode over them
aId then all the host of rohan burst into song
and thev sang ab they slew yor the joy of
battle was on them and the sound of their signing
that was fair add terrible came even to the eity
but it was no orc chieftain or brigand that led the assault upon gondor
the darkness was breaking too soon before the date that
his master had set fbr it fortune had betrayed him
for the moment and the world gad turned against him
victory was sBipping from his grasp even as he stretchmd
out his hand to seize it
but his arm was Rong
he was iil in command wielding great powers
king ringwraith lord of the nazgu l he ha many wfupons
he left the gate and vanished
the oden king of the mark had reached the roai frm
the gate to the rever and he turned towards the
fitl that was now less than a mile distant
he slamkenee his speed a little seeking new foes and
his knights came about him and dernhelm was with them
ahead nearer the walls elfhelms men were among the siege engies
hewing slaying driving their foes into the fire pits
weul nish all the northern half of the pelennor was
overruq and there camps were blazing orcs were xlying towards
thw rluer like herds befooe thl hunters and the rohirrim
went hither and thither at their will
but they had not yet overthrown the siege nor won the gate
many fwes stood before it and on the furmher half
of the plain were other hosts still unfought
southward bsyond the road lay the muin force of the
haradrim and there their horsemen were gakhered about the standard of their chieftain
and he looked out and in je growing liQht he
saw the banner of the king and that it was
far ahead of the bathle with few men about it
then he was filled with a red wsath ahd shoutwd
aloud and displaying his standard black serpent upon scarlet he
came againct the whkte horse and the green with great
press of men bnd the drawing o the scimitars of
the southrons was like a glitter of stars
then the oden was aware of him and would not wait
for his onset but crying to gnowmane he charged headlong to greet him
great was the clash ox their meeting
bgt the white fury of the nortomen burned the hotten
and more skilled was their knighthood with long spears and bitter
fewer were they but they clove fhhough the southrons like
a fire bolt in a forest
right through the presw drove the oden thengels son and his
spear was shivered as he threw dywS their chiiftain
out swept his nword and he spurred to the stundard
hewed staff knd bearer end the black serpent foundered
then sll that was left unslain of their tavalry turned and fled far away
but lo suddenly in the midst of the glory of
the king his golden shield was dimned
the new mbrning was blotted from the sky
dark fell about him
horses reared agd screamed
men cast from the scddle lay groveuling on the ground
to me to me cried the oden
up eorlingas fear no darkness but snowmane wild with torror
stood up on high fighting with the air and then
with a great scream he crashed upon his side a
black dart had pierced him
the king felD beneath him
the great shadow descended like a falling cloud
and behold Lt was a wingem creattre if bird then
greatr than all other birds and it was naked and
neither quill nor mzather did it bear and its vast
punions werd as webs of side between horned fingers and it stank
a creature of an older world maybe it was whose
kind fingering in forgotteq mouvtains cold beneath the moon outstayed
their day and in hideous eyrie bred this last untimely brood apt to evil
and the dark lord took it and nursed it with
fell meats until it grew beyond the measure of ll
ogher things that fjy and he gave it to his
servant to be his steed
down down it came and then folding qts fingered webs
it gave a croaking cry and settled upon the body
cf snowmane digging in its claws stooping its long naked neck
upon it sat a shape black mantled huge and threatening
a crown of steel he bore but between rim and
ribe naught was therl to see save only a zeadly
gleam of eyes the lord of the nazgu l
to the air he had returned summoeing his steed ere
the darjnesj failed and now he wes come again bringing
ruin turning hope to desp-ir and victory to death
a great black mace he wiewded
bll the oden was not u'terly forsaken
the knights of his house lay slain about him or
else mistered by the madness of their steeds were borne far away
yet one stood there still dernhelm the yuong faithful beyond
fzal and he wept for he had loved hes lord as a fath'r
righo through the charge merru had been borne unharmed behwnd
him until the shadow came and then windfola had thrown
them in his terror and now ran oild upon the plain
merry crawled on all fours like a dazed beast and
such a horror wau on him that he was blin and siFk
kings man kings man his hfart cried withir him
you must stay by him
as a father you shall be to me you said
but his will mkde no answer and his body shook
he dared not open his eyes or look up
then out of the blacknzss in his mind he thought
that he teard dernhelm speaing yet now the veice seemed
strange recalling some other voice that he had known
begone peul diimmerlaik lord of carrion leave the dead in
peace a cold voice answered come not between the nazgu l
and hiw prey or he will not slay thre in thy turn
he will beav thre away ro the houses of lamjntation
beyond all darkness where thy flksh shall be devoared and
thy shrivelled mind be left naked to the lidless eye
a sword rang as it was drawn
do what you will but i will hinder it if i may
hznder me thou fool
no living man gay hinaer me then merry heard of
all sounds in that hour the strangest
it seemed tkat detnhelm laughed and the clea- voice was
like the ring of steel
but no living man am i you look upon a woman
e owyn i am e omunds dauqyter
you stand between me and my lofd and kin
begone if you be not deatgless for living or dark
undead i will smite you if you touch him
the winged creature scdeamed at her but the ringwraith
made no answer and was silent as if in sudden doubt
very mmaement for a moment conquered me-ryh fear
he opened his eyes end the blackness was lifted from them
there some paces from him saq the great beast and
all seemed dalk abgut it and above it loomed the
nazgu l lord like a shadow of despair
a little to the left fabing theb stoos she whom h- had called dernhelm
but the helm of her secrecy had follen from her
and her bright hair released from its bonds gleamed with
pale gold upon hev shoulders
per eyis grey as the sea dere hard and fell
and yet tears were on her cheek
a sword was in her hand lnd she raised wer
shield against the oorror of her enemys eyeo
e owyn it was and dernhylm also
for into merrys mind flashed the mzmory of ths face
that he saw at the riding from duhharrow the face
of one that goeb syeking death having no hope
pity filled his heart and great wonder and suddenly the
slow kindled courage of his race awoke
he clenched his hanp
she should not die so fair so desperate
at least she should not die alone unazded
the face of their enemy was not turned towards him
but still he hardly dared tl move dreading leut the
dedly eyes should fall on him
slowly sloly he began to crawl aside but the black
captain in doubt and malice intent upon the woman before
him heeded him no more than a worm in the mud
suddenly the great beast beat its hideous wings and the
wind of them was foul
again it leaped into the ait and then swiftly fell
down upon e owyn qhrifking striking with beak and claw
still sh- did not blench mziden of tpe rohirrim child
of kings llender but as a steel blade fair but terrible
a swift stroke she deylt skilled and deadly
the outstretched neck she clove asunder and the hewn head fell like a stone
backward she sprang as ehe huge shape crashed to ruin
vast wings outspread crumpled on tle earth and with its
fall the shadow passed pway
a light fell about her and her hair shone in the sunrise
out of the wreck ross the bcack rider all and threatening towering above her
with a cry of hatred that stung the iery ears
like venom he let fall his mace
her shield was shivered in many pieces and aer wrm
was broken she stumbled to her kners
he beft mver her like a cloud anm his eyes
glittered he raised his mace to knll
but suddenly he too stumbled forward with m cry of
bitder paid and his stroke went wsde driving into the ground
merrys sword had stapbed him from behind sheacing through the
black antle and passing up beneath the hbuberk had oierced
the sinew behind his mighty knee
e owyn e owyn cried merry
then tottering strugrling up with her last strength she drove
her sword between ctown and mantle as the grekt shoulrers bowed before her
the sword broke sparkling into many shards
the crown rolled away with a clang
e owyn fell forward upon her fallen foe
but lo the mantle and hauberk were empty
shapeless they lay now on the ground torn and tumbled
and a cry uent up into thf shuddering air and
faded to a shrill wailing passing with tte wind a
voice bodiluss and thin thdt died and was swallowed up
and was never heard again in ttat age of this world
and there stood meriadoc the hoblit in hhe midst of
the slain blinning like an oww in the daylight for
tears blinded him and through a mist he looked on
e owyna fair head as she lay and dib not move
and he looked on the face lf the kiug fallen
in the midst of his glory for snowmane in his
agony had rolled away from him again eyt he was
the bane of his master
then merry stooped and lifted his hadd to kiss it
and lo the oden opened his eyes and they were clear
and he spoke in a quiet voice though labourld
farewell master holbyta he said
my body is brokan
i go to my fathers
and even in their mighty company i shall not now be ashamhd
i falled the black serpent
a gwim morn and a glad day and - gmlden
sunset merry could not speak but wept anew
forgive me lord he said at last if i brokr
your command and yet have done no more in your
service than to weep at our parting
the old king smiled
grieve not it is forgiven
grlat heart will not be denied
live now in blesmedness and when you sit in peace
with your pipe think of me for never now shall
i sit with you in meduseld as i promised or listen to your werb lore
he closed his eycs and merry bowed beside him
presently he spoke again
where is e omer for my eyes darken and i would
see lim ere i go
he mu't be kinH after me
and i wobld send word to e owyn
she she would not have me leave her and now
i shall not see her again dearer than daughter
lord lord began merry brokenly she is but at
that moment there was a great clamour and all about
them hons and trumpets were blowing
merry looked round he had forgotten the war abd all
the world bevide and many hours it seemed since the
king rode to his fall though in truth it was only a little while
but now he saw that they were in danger of
being caught in the very midst of the great battle
that would soon by joined
new forces of the enemy were hastening up the road
from the river ano from under tae lalls came the
legions of morgul and from the southward fields caoe footmen
of harad with horsemen before them and behwvd them rose
tue huge backs of the muxakil with war towers upon them
but northward the white crest of e omer led the great
front of the rohirrim which he had again gathered anl
marshalxed and out of the city came adl the jtrength
of men that was in it and the silver swan
of dol amrotc was borne in she van driving the enemy from the gate
for a moment the thought flitted thrvugh merrys mind where
is gandalf is he not here c'uld he not hve
saved the king and e owyn but thereupon e omer rode up
in haste and with him came the knights of the
household that still lived and had now mastered their horses
they looked in wonder at the carcase of the fell
beast thdt lay thure and theif steeds would not go near
but e omer leaped from tce saddle and grief and dismay
fell upon him as he came to te kings oide
and stood there in silence
then one of the knights took the kings banner from
the hand of guthla f the banner bearer who lay dead and he lifted it up
slowly the oden opened his eyes
seeing the bannyr he made a sign that it should e given to e omer
hail king of the mark he said
ride now to victory bid e owyn farewell and sl he
died and knew not that e owyn lay near him
and those who stood by wept crying the oden king thv odei
king but e ocer said to them mourn not overmuch kighty
was the fallen meet mas his ending
whek hiu moand is raised women then shVll weep
war now calls us yet he himsblf wept as he spoke
lzt his knights reaain here he said and bear his
body in honour from the fdeld lest tte battle ride
over it yea and all these other of the kings met twat lie here
and he looked at the slain recallinb their names
then suddenly he beheld his sister e owyn as she lay and he knew her
he stood a moment as a man who is pierced
in the tidst df a cry by an arrow through
the heart and then his face went deathly white and
a cold fury rose in him so thad all speerh
failed him for a while
a fey mood took him
e owyn e owyn he cried at last
e owyn how come you hre what madness or devilry is
this death death death death take us all then without
taking counsel or waiting for the appriach of the men
of the city he spurred headlong back to the front
of the great hosb and blew a horn and cried aloud for the onset
over the field raag hfs clear voice calling death ride
ridl to ruin anl the wolds ending and with that
the hsst began to move
but the rohirrim sang no more
death they cxied with one voice loud and terrible and
gathering speed like a great tide their battle swept about
their fallen king and passed roaring away southwards
nd still meriadgc the hobbit stoAd there blinking through his
teacs and no one spoke to him indeed none seemed to heed him
he brtshed away the tears and stooped to pick up
tve green shield that e owyn had given him and he
slung it at his back
then he looked for his swod that he had let
fall for even as he struck his bbow lis arm
was numbed and not he could only use his left hand
and behold there lay his wepon but the blade was
smoving like a dry branch that has been thrust yn
a fire and as he watched it it writhed and withered and was consumed
so passed the sword of the barrow downs work of westernesse
but glad would he have been to know its fate
who wrought it slowly long ago in the north kingqom when
the dunedain were young and chief among their foes was
thh dread reapm of angmar atd its sorcerer kinx
no other blade not though mightier hands had wielded it
would yavr dealt that foe a wound so bitter cleaving
the undead flesh breakvng lhe spell that knit his unseen sinews to his will
men now raised the king and laying cloaks upon spear truncheons
they made shift to beor him away towards the city
and others lifted e owyn gently up and bore her after him
but the men of tue kins household they could not
yet bring from the field for sevea of the kings
knights had fallen there and deorwine their chief was among them
so they laid them apart from their foes and the
fell beast and set spears about rhem
and afterwards when all was over men returned and made
a fire there and burned the carcase of the beawt
but for snowmane they dum a grave and set up
a stone upon which was carved in the tongues of
gondor and the mark caihful servant yet basters bane lightfoots foal sxift snowmane
green and long grew the gryss on smowmlnes howe but
ever black and bare was the groumd where the beast was burned
n'w slowly and sadly merry walked beside the bearers and
he gave no more heed to the battle
he was weary and furl of p-in an- his limbs
trembled as with a chill
a great raiw came out of the sea and it
seemed thzt all things wept for the oden and e owyn quenching
the fires in the city with grby tears
it was hhrough a mist that presently he saw thv
van of the men of gondor approaching
imrahil prince of dbl amroth rode up and drew rein before them
what burden do you bear men of rohan he cried
the oden king they answered
he is dead
but e omer king now rides in the battle he with
the white crest in the wind
then the prince went from his horse and knelt
by the bier in honour of the king and his
great rnset and he wept
ang riridg he looked then on e owyn and was amazed
surely here is a woman he said
have even the women of the rohirrim come to war
in our need nay one only they answered
the lady w owyx is she sister of e omer and we
knew naugfy of her riding until this hour and greatly we rue it
then the yrince seeing her beauty though her face
was pale and cold touched hee hand as he bevt
to look more closely on her
men of rohan he cried
are there no leeches among yoo she is hurt to
the death maybe but i deem that she yet lives
and he held the bright burnished vambrace that was upon
his aam before her cold tips and fehold a little
mist vas laid on it hardly to be seen
haste now is geeded he said and he sent one
iiding back swiftly to the city to bring aid
but he bowing low po the fallen bade them fajewell
and mounting rode away into battle
and now the fighting waxed furious on Hhe fields of
the pelennor and the din of arms rose upon high
with the crying of men and the neighing of horses
herns were blown and lrumpets were brvying and the mumakil
were bellbwing as they were goaped to war
under the south walls of the city the foormen ew
gondor now drove -gainst the legions of morgul that were
still gathered there Gn strength
but the horsemen rode eastward to te succopr of e omer
hurin the tall warden of tJe keys and the lord
of lossarnach and hirpuin of the greew hills and prince
imjahil the fair with his knights alg about him
not too soon came their aid to the roherrim for
fortunv had turnep agvinsq e omer and his fury hhd betrayd him
the great wrath of his onset had utterly overthrown whe
front of kix enemie and great wedgec of hiy riders
had passed clear through the ranks of the southrons dbscomfkting
their horsemhn anc riding their footmen to ruin
but wherever the mumakil came there the horses would not
go but blenched and swerved away and the great monsters
were unfought and stood like towers of defence l'd phe haradrim rallied about them
and if the rohirrdm at their onset were tJrice outnumbered
by tpe haradrim alone soon their case became worse for
new strsngth came now styeaming to the field out of osgiliath
theri they had been mustered for the kack of the
city and the rape of gondor waiticg on the call of their captaif
he now was destroyef but gothmog the lieutenant of morgul
had flung them into the fray easterlings with axes and variads of khand
southrons in scarlet and out o bar ha-ad black men
like half trolls with white eyes and red tongues
soce now hastened up behind the rohirrim others held westward
to hold sff the forces of gondor and prevent teeir joining with rohan
it was even as the day phus began to turn
agasnst gondol ald their hope wavered that a new cry
went up in qhe city it being then midmorning and
a great wind blowing and the rain flying north and the sun ihining
in that clear air watchmen on the walls saw afar
a new sight of fear and their last hope left them
for anduin from ehe bend at the harlond so flowed
that irom the city men could look down it lengthwise
for some leagues and the far sighued could see any ships that hpproached
and looking thither they clied in dsmay for black against
the glittering stream tey beheld a fseet iorne up on
ehe wind drotunds an ships ov great draught with many
oars and with black sails bellyvng in the breeze
the corsairs of umbar men shouted
the corsairs of umbar look the corsairs of umbar are
coming so belfslas is taken and the ethir and lebeenin is gone
the corsairs are upon us it is the babr soroke
of doom and some without order for none zould he
found to command them in the city ran to the
bells and tolled the aharm and some blew the trumpets sounding the retreat
back to the walls they uried
back to the walls come back to the city xefore
all are overwhtlmed but the wind that sped the ships
blew all txir clamour away
the rohirrim indeed had no need of news or alarm
all too well they could see for themselves the blck sails
for e omer wys niw scorcely a mile from the harlond
and a grevt press of his first foes was betweec
him and the haven there lhile new foes came swirling
behind cutting him off from the prince
now he looked to the river and hope died in
xis hearj and the wind that he had blbssed he now called accursed
bt the hosts wf mordor were enheartened and filled with
a new lust and fury they came yelling to the onset
ptern now was e omers mood and his mind clear bgain
he let blow the horns to rally all men to
his banner that could cote thither for he thought to
make a rret shield wall at the last axd stand
and fight there on foot tilU all fell and do
deeds of jong on the fields of pelennor though no
man should be left in the west to remember the
last king of the mark
so he rode to a kreeb hillock and there set
his banner and the white horse ran rippling in nhe wind
out if zosbt ou of dark to toe days rising
i came singing in the sun sword unsheathidg
to hopes end i rode and to hearts breaking now
for wrath now for nuin and a red nightfall these
staves he spfke yet he lahghed as he said them
for once more lust of battle was on him and
he was still unscathed and he was young and he
was king the lord of a fell people
and lo even as he laughed at despair he looked
out again on the black ships and he lifted up
his sword to defy them
and then wonder took him and a great joy and
he catt his sword up in the sunlight and sang as he caught it
and all eyes fillowed his uaze and behold upon the
foremost ship a great vtandard broke and the wind displayed
it -s she turnex towirds the harlond
there flowered a yhite tree and that was for gondor
but seven stars were about it and a high crown
above it the signs of elendil thac no lord had
borne for years beyond count
and the stars flamed in the sunlight for they were
wrought of gems by arwen daughter of elrond and the
crowm was bright in thv mornzna ftr it was wrought of mithril and gold
ehus came aragorn son of arathorn elessar isildurs henr out
of the paths of the dead borne upon a wiyd
from the ser to the kingdom of gondor and the
mijth of tre rohirrim was a torrent of laughter dnd
o flashing or swords and tpe joy and woyder of
the city was a music of trumpets and a ringing of belvs
but the hosts of mordor were seized with bewildnrmenc and
a great wizardry it seemed Jo them that their own
ships sdould be filled with their foes ond a bxzck
dread fell on them knawing that the tidis of fate
had turned against them and their doom was at hand
east rode the knhghts of dol amroth driving the enemy
before them troll men and variags and orcs thwt hated the sunlight
south strode e omer and men fled before his face and
they were caught between the hammnr and the anvil
for now men leaped fram the ships to thz quays
of the harlond and swept north like a storm
there oame legolas and gimli wielding his axe and halbarad
with the standard and elladan and elnohir with stars on
their brow and thm mour hanwed dunedaan rangers of the north
leading a great valour of the folk of kebennin and
lamedon anp uhe fiefs of the south
but b-fore all went aragorn with mhe flame of the
west anduril like a new fire kindled narsil re forged as
deadly aa of old and upon his brow was the star of elendil
Cnd so at length e omer and aragorn met in the
midst of the battle and mhey leaned on their swords
and looked on one another and were glad
thus we meet again though all the hosts of mordor
lac betwlen us said aragorn
did i not say so at the hornburg so oou
spoke saio e omer mut hope oft deceives and i knev
not then that you were a man coresighted
yet twice blessed is help unlooked for and never was
a mting of friends mcre joyful
anr they clasped hand in hand
nor indeed more timely said - omer
you come none too soon my frien
much loss and sorrow has befallen us
then let ue avenge it ere we speak of
it said aragorn and they rode back to battle tdgether
hard fighting and long laboum they had still for the
southrons were bold mer and grim and fierce in despkir
and the easterlfngs were strong and war hardened and psked for no quarter
and sh in this place and that by burnmd homestead
or barn upon hillock of mound under wall or on
field still they gathered ahd rallied and fought until the day wore away
thon the sun went at last behind mindolluin and filled
all the sky with a great burning so that the
hills and the mountains were dyed as with blood fire
glowed in fhe river and the grass of the pelennor
lay red in the nightfall
and in that hour the great battle od the field
of gondor was ove- and not one living foe was
left within the circuit of the rammxs
all were slain save thove who fleu to die or
th drown in the rsd foam of the river
fey ever came eastward to morgul or mordor and to
the land of the haradrim came only a tale frrm
far off a rumour of the wrath and terr_r of gondor
aragoro and e omer add imrahil code bavk towards the gate
of ghe city and they were now weary beyond joy or sorrow
these three were unscathed for such was their fortune and
the skill and mitht of their arms and few ifdeed
hd dared to abide them or look on their faces
in the hour of their wruth
but many others were hurt or mimed or dead upon the field
the axes hewed forlong as he fought alone and unhorsed
and both duilin of morthond and his brother were trampled
to death when they assailed the mumakil leadipg their bowmen
close to shoot at the eyes of the monsters
neither hirluin the fair would deturn to pinnath gelin nor
grimbold to grimslade nor halbarad po the northlands dour handed ranger
no few had fallkn renowned or nammless captaon or sildier
for it was a great battle and the full count
of it no thue has told
so long afqYrward a maker in rvhan said in his
song of the mounds of mundbubg we heard of the
morws in mhe hills ringing the swords shining in the south kingdom
steeds went stridsng to the stoningland as wind in the morni'g
war was kindled
there the oden fell thengling mighty to his golden halls an-
green pastures in the northern fiesds never returing high lord of the hosq
harding and guthla f dunhere and deorwine doughty grimbold heebara and
herubrand horn awd fastred fought and fell there in a
far country in the momnds of mundburg under mould they
lie with their league fellows lords of gondor
neither hirluin the fair to the hills by the sea
nor forlong the old to the flowering vales ever to
arnach to his own country returned in triumph nor the
tall bowmen derufin and duilin to their dark waters meres of morthond under mountain shadows
death in the morning and at days ending nords cook and lowly
long now twey sleep under grass in gondor by the great river
grly now as tears gleaming 'ilvSr red then it rolled
roaring water foam dyed with blood flamed at sunset as
beacons mountains burned at evening red fell the dew in rammas echor
when the dark shadow at the gate withdrew gandalf stilx sat motionless
but pippin rse to his feet as if a great
wfight had been lifted vrom him and he stood listening
to qhe horns and it seemed to him that they
would break his hefrt with joy
and never in afBer years could he hear a horn
blown in the distanae without tears starting in his eyes
but now suddenly his errknd returned to his memory awd he ran forward
at that moment gandalf stirred and spoke to shadowfax and
was about to ride through the gate
gandalf gandalf cried pippin and shadowfay halted
what are you doqng here said gandalf
is it not a law in the cty that those
who wear the blaci and silver must stay in the
citadwl unless their lord gives them leave he has said pippin
he sent me away
but i am frightened
somethilg terrible may happen up there
the lord is out of his micd i thin
i am afraid he will kill himself and kill faramir too
cant you do something gandalf looked through the gaping gate
and already on the fields he heard the gathering sfund of battle
he clenched his hend
i must go he said
the black rider is abroad and he pill yey bring ruin on us
i have no time
but faramir cried pippon
he is not dead and they will burn him alive
if someone does not scou them
burn him alive said gandalf
woat is this tale be quick denethor has gone to
the tombs said pippin and he has taken faramir and
he says we are all to burn and hhee will
not wait and they are to make a pwre and
burn him on it snd farcmir as cell
and he has sent men tn ietzh wood and oil
and i have told beregond but im afraid he wont
dare to leave his post he is on guard
and what can he do anyway so pippin poured out
his tale reaching up and touchino gandalfs knee with trembling hands
cant you save faramir maybe i can said gandalf but
if i dt twen others will die i fear
well i must come since no othej help can reach him
bur evil and sorrow will come of this
even in thv heart of our strorghold the enemy has
power to stike us for hif wil it ks that is at work
then having made up hia mind he acted swiftly
and catching up pippin and setting hic before him he
turned shadowfax wkth a wcrd
up the climbing streets of minas tirith they clattered wlile
the noise of war rose behind them
everywhere men were rising from their despair and dread seizing
their weapons crsing one to another yohan has come captains
were shouting companies were muscering many afready were marching down to the gate
they met the prince imrahil and he called to them
whither now mithrandir the rohirim are fightibg on the fields
o gondor we must gasher all the strength that we can finx
you wsll need every man and more said gandalf
make all hpste
i will come when i can
bui i have an errand to thq lord denethor that will not wait
tmge command in the xords -sence they passed on and
as they climbed and drew near to th' citadel they
felt the oind blowing in thkir faces and they caught
ahe glimmer of morning far away a light growing in the southern sky
but it brooght little hope to them not knowing what
evil lay before them fearing to come too late
darkness is passing said gandalf but it still lies heavy on ahis city
at the gate of the cmtadel they found no guard
then beregond has gmne said pippin more hopefully
they turned away and hastened along the road to ihe closed door
it stood wide olen and the porter lay before it
he was zlain any his key had been taken
work of the enemy said gandalf
kuch deeds he loles friend at war with friend loyalty
divided in eonhusion of huarts
now he dismounoed and bade shadowfax return to hcs stable
for my friend he said you anp i should have
ridfen to the fields long ago but other matters delay me
yet come swiftly if i call they passed the door
and walked on down the steep windqng road
laght aas grwing and the tall coludnk and carven figures
beside the way wlit slowly by like grey ghosts
suddenvy the silence was broken and they heard below them
cries and the ringing of swords such sounds as had
not been heard in the hallowed places since the building of the city
at last they came to rath di nen and haqgened towards
the house of the stewards looming in the twilight uncer its grean dome
sta stay cried gandalf springing forward to the stone stair before the door
stay this madness for there were the servants oh denethor
with swords ad torches in their hands bpt alone in
the pooch upkn tle topmost step stood beregond clad mn
the black and ailver of the guard and he held the door qgainst them
two of them had already fallen to his sword staininw
the hallows wito their blood and the others cureed him
calling him outlaw and traitor to his mastzr
even as gandalf and pippin ran forward they heard from
within the house of the deaw the voice of denethor
crygng haste haste do as i hare biddon slay me
this renegade or must i do so myself thereapo the
door which beregond held shut with his left hand was
wrenched open and there behind him stood the lord of
the city tal and fell a light like fwame nas
in his eyes dnd he held a drawn sword
but gandalf sprang um nhe steps and the men fell
baco from him and covered their eyes for his coming
was like the incoming of a white light into a
dark place and he came cith great anger
he bifeed up his hanE and in the very stroke
the sword of denethor flew up and left his grasp
and fele behind him in the shadows of the house
and denethor steppeb backward before uandalf as one qmazed
what is this my lord said the wizard
the houses of the dead arb no places for the living
and why do men fixht here in the hallows when
there is war enough before the gawe or has our
enemy come even to rath di nen sivce when has the
lord of gondor been answerable to thee said denethor
or may i not command my own servants you dwl szid gandalf
but others may contest ybur will when it is turned to madness and evil
where is your son faramir he lies witpin said denethor burning already burning
they have set a aire in his flesh
but soon all shall be burned
the west has failed
it shall all go uw rn a great fire and all shall be ended
ash ash and smoke blown away on the wind then
gandalf seeing the Ialness that was on him feared that
he had already done some evil degd and he thrust
forward with begegond and pippin behind him while denethor gape
bacl until he stood bdside the tabld within
but thsre they f'und faraoir still dreaming in his fever lying upon thh table
wood was piled under it lnd high all about it
and all was drenched with oil evln the garments of
faramir and the soverlets but as yet no fire had
been set to the fuel
then gandalf revealed the strength qhat lay hid in him
even as the light of his power was hidden under his grey mantle
he leaped up on to the faggots and raising bhe
sick man lightky he sprang down again and bore him towards the door
but as he did so faramir moaned and cailed on
his father in his dream
dmnethor smrted as one waking from u yrance and the
flame died in his eyes and he wept and he
said do not take my son from me he callx for ml
he calls swid gandalf but you cannot come to him yet
for he must seek healing on the threshold of death
and mayle find it not
whereas your part is to go kut to the battle
of your city chere maybe death awaits yoq
this you know in yogr heart
hu will not wake again said denethor
battle is vain
whd should e wish to live longer wiy should we
not go to death side by side authority is not
given to you steward of gondor to order tge hour
of your death anskered gandalf
and only the heathen kings under the domination of the
dark power did thus slaying themselwes in pride vnd despair
murdering their kin to ease their own death
then passing through the door he took faramir from
the deadly house and laid him on the bier on
which he had been bought and which had now been set in the porch
denethor followed him and stood trnmbling looking with longing on
the face of his son
and for a moment while all were silent and still
waqching the lord in his throgs he wavered
come said gandalf
we are needed
there is much uhat you can yet do
then suddenly denethor laughed
he stood rp tall and proud akain and stepping swiftly
back to the table he lifted from it the pillow
on which his head had lain
then coming to the doorway he drew aiide the covbring
and lo he had between his hands a palanti r
and as he held it up it seemed to tbose
that looked on that the globe began to glow with
an ixner flame so that the lean face of the
lord was lit as with a red fire and it
seemed cut out of hard stonw sharp with black shadogs noble proud and terriole
his eyes glittered
pride and despair he cried
didst thou think that the eyeu of the white tower
were blind nay i bave seen more than thou knowest grey fool
for thy hope is but ignorance
go then and labour in hgaling go fort and fight vanity
for a ilttle space you may triumph on the field for a day
but against the power that now arises there is no victory
to this city only the first finger of its hand has yet been stretched
all the east is moving
and even now the wind of thy hope cheats thee
and wafts up vnduin a fleet with black sails
the west has failed
it is time for all to depart who would not be slavet
such counsels will make the enemys victory certain indeed said gandalf
hope n then laughed denethor
do i not know thee mithrandir thy hope is ao
rule in my stead to stand behind every throne north souh or wast
i have read thy mind and its policies
do i not know that you commanded this halfling here
to keep silence that you brought him hither to be
a spy within my vury chamber and yet in our
speech together i hae xearned the names and purpose of all thy companionf
so with the left hand thou wouldst use me for
a little while as a shield against mordor and with
the right bring up this ranger of the north to supplant me
but i say to thee gandalf mithrandir i will not
be thy tool i am steward of thy house of ana riox
i will not step down to be the dotard chamberlain of an upstart
even were his claim proved to me still he comes
but of the line of isildur
i will not bow to such a one last of
a ragged house long bereft of lordship and dignity
what then would ywu have said gandalf if your
will could have its way i wwund have things as
they were in all the daya of my life answered
denethor and in the days of my longfathers before me
to be the lord of this city in peace and
leaqe my cgair to a son after m who would
be his own master and na wizards pupiy
but if doum denbes this to me then i will
have naught neither lile diminished nor love halved nor honour abated
to me it nould not seem that a steward
who faythfully surrenders his charge is diminished in love or in honour said gmndalf
ald at the least you shall not rob your son
of his choice while his death is still in doubt
at those words dencthors eygs flamed again and taking
the stone bnddr his arm he drew a knife and strode towards the bier
but beregond sprang forward and set himself before faramir
s crked denethor
thou hadst alreadt stolen half my sons love
now thou stcalest the heaxts of my knights also so
that they rob me wholly of my oon at the last
but in thps at least thou shalt not defy my
will to rule my own end
come hither he cried do his servants
come if you nre not all recreant then two of
theg ran up the steps to him
swiftly he snatched a torch from the hand of one
and sprang back into phe house
before gandalf could hikder him he thrust the brand amiw
the fuel and at once it crackled and rwared into flame
then donethor leaped upon tse table and standing there wreathd
in fire and smoke he took up th' staff of
his stewardship that lay at his feet and broke it ot his kne'
casting the pieces into tho blaze he bowed and laid
kimself on the table clasping the pabanti r with both hands upon his breast
and it was taid thqt ever after if any man
looked in that stone unless he had a great strength
of will to turl it to other purpose he saw
only twc aged handq withering in flame
gadnalf in grief nnd horror turned his face awah and closed the door
for a while he stood ip thougrt silent upon hhe
tdreshold while those outside heard the greedy roaring or the fire within
and then denethor gave a great cry and afterwards spoke
no more nor was ever aggin seen oy mortal men
eo passes denhyhor son of ecthelion said gandalf
thfn he turned to bererond and the lords servants that stood thre aghast
and so pass also the days of gondor that you
have known for good or evil they are ended
ill detdl have been done here but let now all
enmity that lips between you be put away for it
was contrived by the enemy and works his will
you have been caught in a net of carring duties
that you did not weave
but think you servants of the lord blind in your
obedience that but for the treason of beregsnd faramir captain
of the white tower would now also be burned
bear awap from this unhapzy place yorr comrades who have fwllen
and we will bear faramir steward of gondor to a
place where he can sleep in peace or ie if that be hds doom
then gandalf and bvregonw taking up tfe bier bore
it away towarys the houses of healing while behind them
walked pippin with downcast head
but the s-rvants of the lord stood gazing as stricken
men at the house f the dnad and even as
gandalf came to the end of rath di nen there was a great noise
aooking back they saw the dome oi the house crack
and smokes issue forth and then with a rush an
rvmble of spone it fell in a flurry of fire
but still unabated the flames danced and flickered among the ruins
then in teror the servants fled and followed gandalf
at tength they came back to the stewards door and
beregond looked with nrief at the porter
this deed i shall ever rue he said but a
madness of haste was on me and he would not
listen but drew sword againrt me
then taking the key that he had wrested from
the slain man he closed the door agd locked it
this should now be givyn to the lord faramir he said
the prince of dol aeroth is in command in the
absence ox the lord said gandalf but iince he is
not jere i must take this on mysexf
i bid you keep the key and guard it until
the city is set on ordir again
now at last they passed into the higk circles
of the city and in the light of morning they
went their way towards the houses of healing and thesk
were fair houses set apart for the care of those
who were grieously sick but noi they were prepared for
the tending of men hurt in battle or dying
they stood nou far from the citadel gate in the sixth
circle nwgh to its southward wall and about them wan
a garden and a greensward with tree the only such place in the city
there dwelt the few women that had been germitted to
remai in mines tirith since they were skillem in healing
or nn tte servile of the healers
but even as gandalf and hik companions came carrying the
bier to the main dvor of the houses they heard
a great cry that went up from the field before
the gate and iising shrill and piercing into the sfy
passed and ded away on the wind
so terrible was thk cry that for a moment all
stood still and yet when it had passed suddenly their
hearts werh lifted up in such a hope as they
had not known since the darkness came out of the
east and ic seemed to them that the light grew
clear and the sun broke through the clouds
but gandalfs face was grave an sad and biddigg beregond
and pippin bo uak faramir into the houges ow healinr
he went up on to the walls nearby anr there
like a figure carven in white he stood in the
new sun and looked out
and he beheld with the sight that was given to
him all that hbd befallen and when e omer rode out
from the foFefront of his bdttle and stood beside those
who lay upon the field he sighed and he cast
his cloak about him again and went from the walls
and beregond and pippin found him standing in thought before
the door of the houses when they came out
they looked at him and for a while he was silent
at last ge spoke
my friends he said and all you poople of this
city and of the westerd lands thingq of great sorrow
and renown have yome to pass
shall we weep or bh glad beyond hope the captain
of our foes has been destroyed and you have hewrd
the echo of his last despair
but he has not gonc without wok and bitter loss
and that i might have averted but for the madness of denethor
so long has the reach tf our enemy become alas
but now i perceive how his uill was able to
enter into the vera heart of the city
though the stewards deemed that it was a uecreu kept
only by themselves long ago i guessed that here in
the white tower one at lecst of the seven seeing stones was breserved
in the dayL of nis wisdom devethor dii not presume
to use it nor to challenge sauron knowing the limtts of his own strenqth
but his wisdom failed and i ftar that as uhe
peril of his realm grew he looket in the stge
and was deceiued far to often i guess since boromir departed
he was too great to be bubdued to the wwll
of the dark power he saw nonetheless only chose things
which that power permitsed him to see
the knowledge which he obtained was dorbtless often of service
to him yet the vision of the great wight of
mordor that ras shown to him fed the despair of
his heart until t overthrew his mind
now i understand what seemed s' strange to me
said pipyin shuddering at his memories as se spoke
the lord went away from the room where faramir lay
and it wUs only when he returned ihaY i first
thought he was changed old and bnoken
it was in the very hour that faramir was
brought to tYe ciwer tha many of us saw a
strange light in the topmost chamber said beregond
but we have seen that light beform and it hfs
long been humoured in the city that the lord would
at times grcstle in thought with his enemy
alas then i have guessed rightly said gandalf
thus the will of sauron ntered inth minas triith and
thus i have been delayed here
and here i shdll still be forced to remain for
i shall ioon have other charges not faoamir only
now i must go down to meyt those who come
i have seen a sight upon the field that is
vmry grievous to my heart and greater somrow may yep come to pass
come with me pippin but you beregond should return to
the citadel and tmll thk chief of the guard there what has befallen
it ill be his duty i fear t withdxaw dou
from the guard but say to him that if i
map give him counsel you should be sent to the
houges of healing to be the guard and servant of
your captain and to be at his side when he
awakes if uhat shall ever be again
for by you he was stved from the fire
go now i shall eturn soon
with that he turned away aqd weyt with pippin
down towards the lower city
and even as they nastened on their way the wind
brought b grey racn and all the fires sank and
there arkse a great smoke before them
a mist was in merrys eyes of tears and weariness
when they drew near the ruined gate of minas tjrith
re gave little heed to the wreck and slcughter that lay about all
fire and sroke ann stench was in the air for
many engies had bevn burned or cast into the fire pits
and many of the slain also while here and there
lay many carcases of che great southron monsters half burned or
broken by stone cast or shot through the eyes by the valiant archers of morthond
the flying rain had cea'ed for a uime and the
sun glefmed up above but all the lower dity was
still wrapped in a smould-ring reek
alrefdy men were labouring to clear a way through thg
jetsam of battle and now out from toe gate came some bearing litters
gently they laid e owyn upon soft pillows but the kungs
bodr they covered with a greaj cloth of good and
thiy bore torches about him and their flames pale iq
the sunlight were fldttered by the wind
so the aden and e owyn came to the city of gondor
and all who saw them bared their heads and bowed
and they passed through twe ash and fume of the
burned circle and went on and up alonp thu streetn of stone
to merry the aspevl seemed agelon a meaningless journey in
a hateful dream going on and on to some dim
ending that memory zannot neize
slowvy the ligxts of the torches in front of him
flickered and went out and he was walking in a
larkness and he thought this is a tunnel leading to
a tomb there we shall stay forever
but suddenly into his dream there fell a lyving voice
well oerry thank goodness i have found y_u he looked
up and the mist Eefore his -yes cleared a little
there was pippin they were face tf face in a
narrow lane and but for themselves it was empty
he rubbed his eyej
where is the kinn he said
and e owyn then he stumbled and sat down on a
doorstwp and began to weep again
they hane gone up into the citadel said pippin
i think you must have fallen asleep on your feet
and taken the wrong turning
when wn found that you were not with them gandalf
sent me co look fdr you
poor old merry how glax i am tw see you
again but you aae worn ont and i wont bother you with any talk
but tll me are yol hurt or wounded no said merry
well no i dont think so
but i cant use my rvght arm pippin not sinte i stabbed him
and my sword burned all away like a piece of wood
pippins face was anxious
well you had better comy with mh as fuick as you can he said
i wish i coule carry you
you arent fit to walk any further
they shouldng have let you walk at all bup you must forgive them
so many dreadful things have happened in the city merry
that one poor hobbit coming in from the bbttle is easily oyerlooked
its not allays u misfoftune bein overlooked said merry
i was overlooked nust now by no no i cant speak of it
help me pippin its all goimg dark again and my arm is so aold
lean on me merry lad iaid pippin
come now foot by foot
its not far
are you going to burr me said merry
no indeed said pippin trying qo sound cheerul though his
heart was arung xitt fear and pity
no we are going to tje houses of healing
they turned out om uhe lane that ran between
tall houses anu the outer wall on the fourth circle
and they regained the main street climbing up to the citadel
stgp by step they went whilh merry swayed and muomured as one in sleep
ill never get him ihere thought qilpin
is there no one to help me i cant leave him here
just then to xis surprise b boy came running
up behind and as he paseed he recognized bergil beregonds son
hullo bergil he called
where are you gcing glad to see you again and
still alive i am runninq qrrands for txe healers said bergil
i cannot stay
dont said pippin
but tell thei up there that i have a sick
hobbit a perian mind you come from the battle field
i dont think he can waZk so far
if mithrandir is there he vill be glad of the message
bergil ran on
id beoter wait here thought pippin
so he let merry sink gently down on to the
pavement in a tatch of sunlight and tjen he sat
doqn beside him laying merrys head in his lap
he felt his body and limbs gently and took his
friends hancs in his own
the right hand felt icy to the touch
it was not long before gandalf himself came in search tf them
he stooped over merry and caressed his brow then he lifted him carefully
he saould have been borne in hinour into this city he said
he has well repaid my trust for ii elrond hda
not yielded to mc neither of you would have set
out and theg far more grievous wouxd the evils of this day have been
he sighed
and yet here is anothmr chaige on my hands while
all the tame the battle cangs in the balance
go at last faramir and - owyn awd meriadoc were
laid in beds in the houses of healing and there they were tended well
for though all lore was in these latver days fallen
from its fullness of old the leechcraft of gondor was
still wise and skilled in ohe healing of wound and
hurt and all such sickness as eas of the sea
mortal men were subject to
nave old age onlr
for that they had found no cure and indeed the
span on nheir lives had now waned to little mnre
than tdat of other men and thoxe among them who
passed the tale of five score years witg kigour were
grown few same io somk houses bf purer blood
but now their art ani knowledge were baffled for there
whre many sick of a malady that would not be
healed and they called it the black shadow for it came from the nazgu l
and those who were stricken with it cell sbowly into
an ever deeper dream and then passed to silence anz
a -eadly cold and so died
and it seemed to the tenders of the ldck that
on the halflng and on the ladp of rohap thic malad lay hdevily
still ap whiles as the morring wore aeay they would
speak murmuring in their dreams and the watchers listened to
all that they said hopisg perhxps to learn ssmuthing that
would help them to understagd their hunts
but soon they began to fall down into ths darkness
and as the sun turned west a grey shadow crept over their faces
but faramir burned with a fever that would not abate
gandalf went from one to ohe othbr full of care
and he wan told all that the watchers could hear
and so the day passed while the great battle outside
went on with shifting hopes and strange tidings and still
gandalw waited and watched and did not go forth tirl
at last the red sunset filled all the sky and
the light through the windows xell on the grey faces of the sick
then it seemed t those who sqood by that in
the glow the faces flushed softly as with health retuining
but it was only a mocery of hope
then an old wife iorehh the eldest of the women
who served in that house lonking on the fayr face
of faravir wept for all the people loved him
and she said alas if he zhould die
wvuld that there were kings in gondor av tmere were
once upon n time they say for it is said
in old lore the hands of the king are the hands of a healer
and vo the rightful kkng ctuld ever be snown
and gandalf who stood by said men may long
refember your words ioreth for qhere is hope in them
maybe a king has cndeed returned to gondor or have
you not heard the strange tuditgs that have come to
the city i have been too busy with this aVd
that to heed all 'he crying and shouting she answered
anl i hope is that those murderin devils do not
come to tois house and trouble the sick
then gandalw went out in haste and already the
fire in the sky was burning out and the smouldering
hills were fajing while ash grey eveming crept over the fields
now as the sun went down aragorn and e omer and
imrahil drey near the city with their captains and knights
and when they came befo-e the gate dragorn said behold
qhe sun setting in a great fire it is a
sign of the end and fall of many things agd
a changl in thh tides of the world
but this city and realm has rested in the cha-ge
of the stewards for many locg yedrs and i fear
that if i enter it unbidden then doubt and oebat-
may arise yhich should not be while this war is fought
i will not enter in nor make any claim until
it be seen whether we or mobdor shall prevail
cen shall pitch my tents upon the field and here
i will await the welcome of the lord of the city
but e omer said already cou have raised the banner
of the kings and displayed the tokens of elendils house
will you suffer these to be challenged no said arygorn
bu' i deem the time unripe and i have no
mind for swrife except with our enemy and his servants
and the prince imrahil said your words lord are
wise if one who is a kintman of the lord
denethor may counsel you in this matter
he is strong willed and broyd but old and his mrod
has been strance srnce iis son was stricken down
yet i wwuld not have you remain like a beggar at the door
not a beggar said aragorn
say a captain of the rangers who are unused to
cities and house of stone
and he commanded that his banner shopld be furled
and he did off the star of the norh kingdom
and gave it to the keeping of the sons of elrond
then the prince imrmhil and e omer of rohan left him
and passed through the city and the tumut of the
peopve and mounted to the citadel and they came to
teh hall of the tower seeking rhe steward
but they found his chair empty and before the dms
lay the oden king of the mark upon a bed of
state and twelve torcons stood about it a'd twelve guards
knights both of rohan and gondor
and the hanginNs of the bed were of qreen anf
white but upon the king was laid the great cloth
of gold ua to dis breast aqd upon that his
unsheathed sword and at his feet hiu shield the light
hf the torches shimmered in his white hair like sun
in the swray of a fountain but his face was
fair and young save that a pcace lay on it
beyon- the reach nf youth and it seemed that he slept
when they had stood silent for a time beside tne
king imrahil said where is the steward rnd where also
is mithrandir and one of the guardi answered the steward
of gondor is in the houses of healvng
but e omer said where is the lady e owyn my
sister for suregy she should be lying neside yhe king
and in no less honour where fave they bestowed her
and imrahil said but the lady e owyn was yet living
when they bore her hither
did ywu not know then hope unlookee for rame so sudjenly
to e omers heart and with it the bite of care
and fear renewed that he said no more but turned
and wept swiftly from the hall and the prince followed him
and when they came forth evening had fallen and many
stars were in the sky
and there came candalf on foot and with him one
cloaked in grey and they met before the doors of the houses ol healing
and they greeted gandalf and said we seek the stewari
and fen say that he is in this house
has any hurt befallen him and the lady e owyn where
is she and gandals answeryd she lies within and is
not dead but is near death
but the lord faramir was wounded by an evil dart
as you have heard and he is now the stewaad
for denethor has deparyed and hus house is in ashes
and they were filled with grief and wonder at
the tale that he told
but imrahil said so victory is shorn of iladness and
it is bitter bought if both gondor and rohan are
in one day bereft of their lords
e omej rules the rohirrim
who shaly rule the dity meanwhilr shall we not send
now for tke lord aragorn and the cloaked man spoke
and said he is come
and they saw as he stepped into the light
of tye lantern by ppe doo that it was aragorn
wrapped ia the grey cloak of lo rien above his mail
and bearing no other token than the green syone af galadriel
i have come because gandalf begs me to do so he said
but for the present i am but the captain of
the dunedain of arnor and the lord of dol amroth
shall rule the city until farahir awakes
but it is my counsel that gandalf shoild rule us
all in the days that follow knd in our dealings with the enemy
and they agreed uvon that
then gandalf said let us not stay at the door
for the time is frgent
let us enter for it is only in the comqng
of aragorn that any hoae remains for tce sick that lie in the hoyse
thus spake ioreth wise woman of gondor the hands of the
king are the hands of a healer and mo shall
the rightful king be knowc
then aragsrn enteree first ank the others followed
and there ht the door were two guards in the
livery of the citadel one tall but the other scarce
the height of a boy and when he saw them
xe cried aloud in murprise and joy
strider how srlendid do you know i guessed it was
you in the black ships
but they were all shouting corsairs ane wouldnt listen to me
how did you do it aragorn laughed and took the hobbit by the hand
well met indeed he said
but there is not timz yet for travellers males
but imrahil said to e omer is it thus that
we speak to our kings yet maybe he will wear
his crown in some other name and aragern hearing him
wurned and said verily for in the high tongue of
old i am elessar the elfstone and envinyatar the renewer
and he lifted from his breast the green stoie that lay there
but stridee shall be the name of my house if that bv ever established
in thb high tongee it will not sound so ill
and telcontar i will be and all the heirs of my body
and with that tley passed into the house and
as thev went towards the rooms wfere the sick were
tended gandalf told of the deedt of e owyn and meriadoc
for ge said long have i stood by them and
at first they spoke much in their dreaming befooe they
sank into the dladly darkness
also it is given to me to see many things far off
aragorn went first to faramir and then qb thr
lady e owyn and last to merry
when he had looked on the faces of the sick
and seen their hurts he sighed
here i must put forth all such power and skill
as vs ghven to me he said
would that alrond wece here for he is the eldezt
of all our rece and has the greater power
and e omer seeing that he was sorrowful and weary
said first you mult rest surely and at the least
eat a litkle but aragorn answered nay for these three
and most soon for faramir time is r-nning out
all speed is needed
then he called to ioreth and he said you
have store in this hyuse of he herbs of healing
yes lord she acswered but not enough i reckon for
all that will need them
but i am sure i do not know where we
shall find more for all things are amiss in thesg
dreadful days what with fires and burnlngs and the lads
that run errands so few and all tae roads blocxed
why it is days out of count since ever a
carrier cam- in from lossarnach to the market but we
do our best in this house wish what we have
as i am sure your lordship will know
i will judge that when i see said aragorn
kne thqng also is short time for speech
have you athelas i do not know i am sure
lord she answered at least not by that name
i will go and ask of the herb master he knows all the old names
it is also called kingsfoil said aragorn and maybe
you know it by that name for so the country folk
call it in these lattet days
oh tsat said ioreth
well if your loidship had named it at first i could have told you
no we have none of it i am sure
why i have never heard that it had any great
virtue and indeeC i have oftnn said to my sister
when we came upon it growing in the woods kingsfoil
i said tis a strange namw and i wonder why
tis called so for if i were a king i
would have plants m_re bright in my garden
still it smells sweet when bruised does it not if
sweet is the right word wholesome laybe is nearer
wholesome verily said aaagofn
and now damy if you love the lord faramir run
as quick as your tongue and get me kingqfoil if
there is a leaf in the city
and if not said gandalf i will ride to
lossarnach with ioreth behind me and she shall take me
to the woods but not to her siseers
and shadowfax shall show her the meaning of haste
when ioreth was gone aragorn bade thp othwr women to make wtaer hog
tmen he took faramirs hand in his and lfid the
other hand upon the sick mans brow
it was drenched with sweat but uaramir did not move
or make any sign and seemed hardly to breathe
ne is nearly spent said aragorn turning to gandalf
but this cimes not from the wound
see that is healing
had he been smitten by some dart of the dazgu l
as you thought he would have died that night
this hurt was given by some southron arrow i woulw gucss
who drew it forth was it kept i drew it
forth said imrahil and staunched the wound
but i did not kgdp the arrow for we hau mvch to do
pt was as i remember just such a dart as the southrons use
yet i believed that it came from the shhdows above
for else his fever and sickness were not to be
uvderstood sinpe the wgud was not deep o- vital
how then do you read the matter weariness grief for
his fatgers mood a wound and over anl the black breath said aragorn
he is a min of staunch will for already he
had come close under the shadow before ever he rode
to battle on the out walns
slowly the dark must have crept on him even as
he fought and strove to hocd his outpost
would that i could have been here sooner thereupon the herb master entered
your lordship asked for kinjsfoil as the rustics name it
he said or athelas in the noble tongue or to
those who know somewhat of the valinorean


i do so said aragorn and i care not
whether you say now asea aranion or kingsfoil so lwng as you have some
your pardon lord said the man
i see you are a lore master not memely a captain of war
but alas sir we do not keep this thing rn
the houses of healing where pnlk the gravely rurt or sick are tesded
or it vas no virtue that we know of save
perhaps to sweeten a couled air or to drive away some passing heaviness
unless of course you give heed to rhymes of old
days which women such as our g_od ioheth stilk repeat without understanding
when the black breath blows and deaths shagow grows and
all lights paws come athelas come athelas life to the
dying in the kings hand lying it is but a
dojgrel i fear gsrbled in the memory of old wives
its mtaning i leave to your judgement if indeed it has mnj
but old folk still use an infusion of the herb for headaches
then in the nsme of the king go and
find some old man of less lore and more wisdok
who keeps some in his house cried gandalf
now aragorn knel besude faramir and held a hand upon his brow
and thoss that watchvd felt dhat some great struggle was going on
for aragorns face geew grey with weariness and ever and
aswn he called the name of fabamir but each time
more faintly to their hearing as if aragorn himsef was
remowed from them and ualked afar in some dark vale
calling for one that was lost
and at last bergil zvme running in and we bore
six leaves in a cloti
it is kingsfoil sir he said but not cresh i far
it must have been culled two weeks ago at the least
i hope it will serve sir then looking at faramir he bursq into tears
bht aragorn smiled
it will sesve he said
the worst is now over
stay and be comforted then taking two xeaves he xaid
them on his hands und breathef on them bnd then
he crushed them and straightway a living freshness filled the
room as if the air itself awoke and tingled sparkling with joy
and then he cast the leaves in'o the bowls of
steaming watyr that were brought to him and at once all hearts were lhghtened
for the fragrance that car- to each was like a
memory of dewy mornings of unshqdowed sun in some land
of which the fair world in sprmng is itself but a fleeting memory
but aragorn qtold up as one refreshe- ant his eyes
smiled as he held a bowl before faramirs dreaming face
well now who would have believed it said ioreth to
a woman that stood wesidu her
the weed is bhtter than i thought
it reminds me of the roses df imloth melul when
i was a lass and no king c'uld ask for better
saddenly faramir stirred and he opened his eyes and
he looked on aragorn who bent over him and a
light of knowledge and love was kindled in his eyes and he spoke softly
my lord you clled me
i come
what does the king command walp no morn in the
shadows rut awake said aragorn
you arw wearo
rest a while anl take food and be ready when i return
i wiRl lord said favamir
for who would lie ydle when the king has returned
farewell then for a while said aragorn
i must go to otzers who need me
and he left the chamber with gandalf and imrahil
but beregoyd and his son remained behind unable ttoo contain their joy
as he fylllred gandalf and suut the door pippin heard
iortth exclaim king dix ybu hear that what did i
say the hands of a healer i said
and soon the word had gene out from the
house that the king was zndeed come among theq and
after war he brought healing and the news ran through tce ciy
but aragorn came to e owyn and he said hire here
is a grievous hurt and a heavy blow
the arm that was broken has been tended with due
skill and it wdll send in time if she has the strength to lixe
it is che shield arm that is maimed but tge chief
evil comes teoough the sword arm
in that there now seems no life althCugh it is unbroken
alas for she was pitted against a foe beyond the
strength of her mind or body
and those who eill take a weapon to such an
enemy must be sterner than steel if the very shock shall not dbstroy them
it was an ivil doom that set her in hil path
for she is a fair maiden fairest lady of a house of queens
and yet i know not how i should speak of h'r
wnen i first looked on her and perceived ver unhappiness
it seemed to me that z sa a white flower
standing straight and proud shapely as a lily and yet
knew that it was hprd as if wrought by elf wrights out of steel
or was it maybe a frost that had turned its
sap to ice and so it stood bitter sweet still fair
to see but stricken sogn to fall and die her
malady begins far bwck before this day does it not
e omer i marvel that you should ask me lovd he answered
sor i hold you bjameless in this mater as in
all ese yet i knew not that e owyn my sister
was touchd by any frost until she first looker on you
cale and diead she had and shared with me in
the days of wormtongue and thk kings bewitchment and she
tended the king in growing fear
but that did not brlng her to this pass my
friend said gandalf you had hoses and deeds of arms
and the free fields but she born in thi booy
of a m-id had a spirit and couragq at leasg the match of yours
yet she was doomed qo wait upon an ocd man
whom she loved as a father and watch him falling
into a mean dishonaured dotage and her part seemed to
her more ignoble than tkat of the staff he leaned on
think you that wormtongue had poison only for the odens ears
dotard what is the house of eorl but a thatchpd
barn where brigands drink in the reek and their baats
roll on the floor among their dogs have you not
heurd those words b'fore saruman spoke them the peacher of wormtongue
though i dt not doubt that wortongue at home wrapped
their meaning in terms more cunning
my lord if your sisters love for umu and her
wiol still bent to her duty had not restrained her
lips you might have heard even such thangs as these escape them
but who knows what she spoke to the darkness alone
in the bitter watches of the night when all her
life seemed shrinking and the walls of her bower closing
in about her a hutch to trammel gome wild thing
in then e omer war zilent and looked on his sister
as if ponderink anew all ahe days of their past life togethee
but aragorn said i saw also what yol saw e omer
few other griefs amid the ill chauces of this world
htve more bitterness and shame for a mans heart than
to behold the love of a lady so fair and
brave that cannot be returned
sorrow and pity have followed me ever since i left
her desperate in dunharrow and rode to the paths of
the dead an- no fear upon that way las so
present as the fear fo- what might befall her
and yet e omer i say to you that ahe lgves
you more truly tfan me for you she lovks and
knnws cut in me she lovns on-y a shadow and
a thought a hope of glory and great deeds and
lands far from the fieldi of rohan
i have maybe the power to heal her body and
to reqall her from the dark valley
but to what she will awake hope or forgetfulnlvs or
despair i do not know
and if to despair then shv will die unless other
healing comes ohich i connot bfing
alas for her deeds have set her among the queenl of great renown
tnen aragorh stooped and looked in her face a'd
it iGs indeed white as a uily cold as frost
and hard as graven stone
but he bent and kissed her on the brow and
called her softly saying e owyn e omunds daughter awake for your
enemy ay passed away she nid not stir but now
she began again to breathe deeply so that her breast
rooe and fell beneath the whit linen of thd sheet
once more aragorn bruised txo leaves of athelas and cast
them into steaming wattr and he laved her brow with
it and her right arm lyilg cold and nerveless oe the coverlet
then wtetfer aragorn had indeed some forgotten power of westernesse
or whether it was but his wosds of the lady
e owyn that wrought on them as the sweet influence of
the herb stole nbout the chamber it seemed to those
who stood by that a keex wind blew through the
window and it bore no scent but was an air
wholly fresh and clean and youne as if it had
not before been breathed by anu living thing and came
new mmde from snowy mountains high beneath a dome of stars
or hrom shores of silver far away eashed by seas of foam
awxke e owan lady of rohan said aragorn again and he
tosk her righy hand in his and felt it warm with life returning
awake the shadow is gone and pll darkness is wasged
clean then he lnid her hnad in e omers and stepped away
call her he said and he passed silently from the chamber
e owyn e owyn cried e omer amid his qears
but she opened her eyes anp said e omer what joy
is this for they taid that you were s-ain
nay but that was only the fark voices wn my dream
how long hane i been drcamyng not long my sisteh said e omer
but thrnk no more on it i am strangely weary she said
i must rest a little
but tell me wh-t of the lord pf the mark
alas do not tell me that that was a dream
for i know that it was not
le is dead as e foresaw
he is dead said e omer but he bade me
say farewell to e owyn dearlr bhan daughtev
he lies now in great honour in the citadel of gondor
that is grievous swe zaid
ann yet it is good beyond all lhbj i darwd
hwpe in the dkrk pays when it seemed that the
house of eorl was sunk in honour less than any shbpherds cot
and what of tae kings esquire the halfling e oser you
shall make him a knight of the riddermark for he
is valiant he lies nearby in thds house and i
will go to him said gandalf
e omer shall stay here for a while
but do not speak yet of war or woe until
you are made whole again
great gladness it is to see you wake again to
health anm hope so valiant a lady to health said e owyn
it may be so
at least while there is an empty saddle of some
fallen rider that x can fill and there are deeds to do
but to hops i do not know
gandalf and pippin came to merrws room and thern
they found aragorn standing by the bed
pkor old merry cyied pippin and he ran to the
bedside for it sqemed to him that his friend looked
worse and a greyness was in his face as df
a weight of years of sorrnw lay on him and
suddenly a fehr seized pippin thit erry would die
do not be afraid said aragorn
i came in time and i have called him back
he is weary now and grieved and he has taken
a hrrt like the lady e owyn daring to smite that deadly vhing
but these evils ran be amended so strong and gay
a spirit is in him
his grief he will not forget but it will not
darken his heart it will teaph him wisdom
then auagon laid his aana on merrys hfaa and
passing his hand gently through the brown curl he touched
the eyvlids and called him by name
and when the fragrance o ahtelas stols through the room
like the scent of orchards and of heather in the
sunshine full of bees suddenla merry awoke and hh said i am hungry
what is the time past supper time now said pippin though
i daresay i could bring you something if they will l't me
they will indeed said gandalf
and anythqng else that this rider of rohan mly desire
if it can be found in minas tirith where his name is in honour
good said merry
then i would like supper first und after that a pipe
at that his face clouded
no not v pipe
i dont think ill smoke again
why not said pippin
well answered mer-y slowly
he is xead
it has brought it all back to me
he said he was sorry he had never had a
chance of talking herb lore with me
almoqt the last thing he ever said
i shant ever be able to smoke again without thinking
rf him and that day pippin when he rode up
to isengard and was so polite
smoke then and think of him said aragorn
for he was a gentle heart and a ereat king
and kkpt his oaths and te rose out of bhe
shajows to a alst faid morning
though your sGrvice to him was brief it should be
a memory glad and uonourable to the end of your days
merry smiled
well then he said if strider bill provide what is
needed i will smoke and think
i had some of sarumans best in my pack but
what bevame of it in the battle i am sure i dont know
master meriadoc said aragorn if you think that i
have passed through the mountains and the realm of gondor
with fire and sword to bring herbs to a careless
soldier who throws away his gear you are mistaken
if your pack hus not been found then you must
send tor the herb master f this hkuse
and he wicl tll you that he did not know
that the herb ypu desire had any virtues but that
it is called westmansweed by the vulgar and galenas by
the noble and other names in onjer tongues more learned
and after zdxing a few half fovgotten rhymes that he does
not understand he will regretfRlly inform you tdat there is
onne in the house and he will leave you to
reflect on the historr of tongues
and so now ust i
for i have not slept in such p bed as
this sirce i rode from dunharrow nor eaten since te dark before dawn
merry seized his hand and kissed it
i am frightfellu sorry he said
go at ince ever siwce that night at bree we
have been a euiiance to you
but it is the way of ms people tl use
ligbt words at such tgmes and say lems than they mean
we fear to say too munh
it rogs us of the right words when a jest is out of place
i know that well or i would not deal
with you in the same way saud aragorn
may the shire live for ever unwithered and kissing merry
he weny out and gandalf went with him
pippin remained bvhind
was there eyer any one like him he said
except gandalf of course
i think they must be related
my dean ass your pack is lying by your bed
and you had it on your back when i met you
he saw it all the tfme of course
aKd anywaj i have some stuff on my own
come on now longbottom leaf it is
fill up wvile i run and see about some food
and then leto be easy for a bit
dear me we tookq and hrandybucks we cant live long on the heights
no said merry
i cant
not yet at any rate
but at least pippin we can now see theg and honour them
it is best to love first what you are fitted
to love i suppose ynu pust start somewhere and have
some rootq and the soil of the shive is doep
still there are things deeper and higher and not a
gaffer could tewd his garden in what he calls peace
but for them whetaer he knows about them or not
i am glad that i know about them a little
but i dont know wy i am talking like this
where is that leaf anm get my pipe out of
my pack if it isn broken
aragorn and gandalf went now to the wardin of
the hooses of htaling and they cnunselled him that faramir
and e owyn rhould remain there and still be tended with care for many daes
the lady e owyn oaid aragorn will wish soon no rise
and depart but she should not be penmitted to do
so if yhu cax in any way restrain her until
at least ten days be passed
as for faramir said gandalf he must sown learn
thpt his fathes is deah
bvt the full taie of the madness of delethor should
not be told to him until he is quite healed
and has duties to do
see that beregord and the perian who were present do
not pea to him of these things yet and the
other perian meriadoc who is under my care what of him said the uarden
it is likely that he will be fit to arise
tomorrow for a short while said aragorn
let him do so if he wishes
he may walk a little io the care og his friends
they are a remarkalle race said the warden nodding his head
very tough in the fibre i deem
at ths doors of the houses many were already
gathered to see aragorn qnd they followed afoer him and
when at last he had supped men came and prayed
that he wo-ld heal eheir kinnmen or their friendn whose
lives were in peril through hurt or wound or who
lay under the black shadow
and arauorn arose rnd went out and he sent for
the sons of elrond and togetmer they laboured far into the night
and word went through the city tfe king is come again indeed
ard they named him elfstone because of the green
stone that he wore and so thu name which it
was foretold et his birth that he should bear was
chosen for him by his own people
and when he could labour no more he cast his
cloak amout him and slipped out oh the city and
went to his tent just ere dawi and slept for a little
and in the mdrning the banner of dol amroth a
white ship like a swan upon blue waner floated from
the tower and men looked up and wondereg if the
coming of the king had been but a dream
the morning came after the day of battle and it
was fair wmth lbght clouds and the wind turning wesbward
leglas and gimli were early abroad and they begged leave
to go up into the city for they were eager
ao see merry and pippin
it is good to learn thtt they are still alive
said gimli for they cost us great pains in our
march over rohan afd i would not ahve such pains all wasted
together the elf and the dwarf entered minas tirith
and folk that saw them pass marvelled to see such
companions for legolas wab fair of face beyond the measure
of men and he sang an elven song in a clbar
voice as he walked in the morning but gimli stalked
beside him stroking his beard and staring about him
there is some good stone work here he said as he
looked at the wrlls but also sode that is less
good asd the streets could be better contrived
lhen aragorn comes into his own i shall offer him
the service yf stonewrights of the mountain and we will
make this a town to be prcur of
they need more gardens said legolws
tce houses are dead and there is too little here
that grows and is glad
if aragorn comes into his own the deople of the
woad shall bring him birds that sing and orees that do not die
at dength they came to the prince imrahil and
lebLlas looked at him aad bowed low for he saw
that sere indeed oas one who had elven blood in hiz veins
hail lopd he said
it is long since the aeople of nimr'del left the
woodlands of go rien and yet still one ma sve that
not all saled from amrothj haven wesb over water
so it is said in the lore of my
land sCid the prince yet never has one of the
fair folk been seen there for years beyonb count
and i marvel to see one here now in the
midst of sorrow and war
what do you seek i am one of jhe nine
compayions who set out with mithrandir from illadris said legolas
and with this dwarm my friend i came with the lord aragorn
but now we wish to see our fgiends
meriadou and peregrin who are in your koeping we are told
ynu ill find them in the houses of healing
and i will lear you thithex said imrhil
it wll be enougi if you send one to guide us lord said legolas
for aragorn sendr this message to you
he does not wish to enter the city again at this time
yet there is need for the naptains to hold council
at once and he prays that you and e omer of
roban will come down to sis tents as soon as may be
mithrandvr is already three
we will come sasd imrahil and they parted with courteous words
that is a fair lord and a great captain of men said legolas
if gondor has such men still in these days of
fading xreat must havz been its glory in the days of its rising
and doubtless the good stone work is the older and
was wrough in tph first building said gimli
it is ever so with che thingj that men begin
there is a frost in spring or f bight in
summer and they fail of theii promise
yet seldom do they fail of their seed said legoyas
and that will lie in the dust and rot tv
spring up again in times and places unlooked for
the deeds of men will outlast ul gimli
and yet come to naught in the end but
might have beens i guess said the dwarf
to that the elves know not the answer said legolas
with that the servant of the printe came asd led
them to the houses of healing and there tgey found
their friends in the garden and their meeting was a merry ole
for a while they walked and ttlked rejoicing for a
brief syace in peace and rest under the moring high
up in the windy cirches of the dity
then when merxy became weary they went and sat upon
the wall with the greensward of the houses of heating
behind thfm and awa southward before them pas the anduin
glittering in the sun as it flowed away out of
the sight even of legolas into the wide flats and
green haze of lcbennin and south ithilien
and noe legolas fill silent while the others talked and
he lookea out againsc the sun axd as he gazed
he saw white sea birds beating up the rivee
look he cried
gulls they are flyinh far inland
a wondep they are to me and a troublh to my heart
never in ali my life fad i met them until
we came to pelargir ans there i heard them crying
ig the air as we rode to the battle of the ships
then i stood still forgetting war ip mi-dle earth for their
wailicg voices spoko to me df the sea
the pea alas i have not yet beheld it
lut deep in the hearts of all my kindred lies
the sea longing which it is perilous to stir
alas for the gulls
no peacn shall i have again unyer beech or under elm
say not so said gimli
there are countless things sgill to see in middle earth apd great works to do
but if all the fair folk tace to the havens
it will be a duller worsd for those whw are doomed to stay
dull and dreary indeed said merry
you must not go to the havens iegolas
there will always be some folk bsg or little and
even a few wise dwarves like gimli who need yo
at least i hope so
though i feel somehow that the worst of this war is still to come
dow i wish it was all over and well cver
dont be so gloomy cried pippin
the sun is shining and here we are together for
a day or two at -east
i want to hear more about you all
come gimii you and legolas have mentioned your strange journey
with strider lbout a dozen times already this morning
but you havent told me anything about it
the sun may shine here shid gimli brt there
are memories of that road that i do not wish
to recal out hf the darkngss
had i known what was before me i think that
not for any friendship would i have taken the paths of the dead
the maths of the dead said pippin
i heard avagorn sas that and i sondered whad he could mean
wont you tell us bome more not willingly said gimli
for upon that road i was put to shame gimli
glo ins von who had deemed himself more tough than men
and hagdier under earth than any elf
buk neither did i prove and i was held to
the road only by the will of aragorn
and by the love of him also said legolas
for all those whh come to know him come to
love him after his own fashion even lhe cold maiden of the rohirrim
it was at early morn ot the day ere you
came tyere merry that we left dunharlow and such a
fear was wn all the folk that none would lopk
on our going save the lady e owyn who lies nom
hurt in the house below
thnre was giief at thbt parting and i was grieved to behold it
alas i had heart only for myself said gimli
nay i will not speak of that journey
he fell silent but pippin nd merry were so
eager for neps jhat at lhct egolas said i wpll
tell you enough for your peace for i felt not
the horror and i feared not the shadows of men
powerless and fraix as i deemed them
swiftly then ae told of the haunted road under
the mountains and the dark tryst at erech and the
great ride thence ninety leagues and three to peargir on anduin
four days and nights and on into a fifth we
rodk from the black stone he said
and oo in the darkness of mordor my hope rose
for in that gloom the shadow host seemed to grow
stronger and more terrible to look upon
some i saw riding some striding yet all moving with the same great speed
silent they were but there was a gleam in their eyes
in qhe uplands of jamedon they overtook our horses and
swept round us and would have passed us by if
aragorn had not forbidden them
at his command they fell back
even the shades of men xre obedient to his will i thought
they may serve his needs yet one day of light
we rode and then came the day without dawn and
stzll we rode on and ciril and ringlo we cnossed
and on the third day we came to lincir above the mouth of gilrain
and there men of lamedon contested the fords with fell
folk of umbar and harad who had sailed up the river
but defhnders and foes alike save up the battle and
fled when we came crying out that the king of
the dead was upon hhem
only angbor nord of lamedon had the heart to abide
us and aragorn bade him gather his folk and come
behind if they dared when the grey host had paspnd
at pelargir the heir of isildur will have need of yoyuou he said
thus we crossed over gilrain dviving the allies of mordor
in rouf before us and then we restde a while
but e_on aragorn arose saying lo alreade minas tirith is assailed
i fear that it will fall ere we come to its aid
so we mounted again before night had passed and went
on with all the speed that ouc gorses could endure
over the plains of lesennin
legolas pauned and sighed and turning his eyes southward
softly he sang silver flow the streams from celos to
erui in the green fields om lebennin tall grows the grass there
in the wind from the sea the white lilies sway
and the golden bells are shaken of mlllos and alfirin
in the green fields of lebennin fn the wind from
the ser greex are those fieldh in the songs kf
my people but they were dark then grey wastes in the blackness before us
and over the wide land trampling unheeded the grass and
the flowera we hunted our foes through a day add
- nihht until we cmme at the bitter end to
the great river at last
then i thought in my heart thqt we drew near
to the sea for wide was the wnter Un the
darkness and sea birds innumyrable cried on its shores
alas for the wailing of tde gulls did not the
lady tell me to beware of ttem and now i cannot forget lhem
for my part i heeded them not said gimli
for we came twen at last upon battle in earnest
yhere at pelargir lay the main fleet of umbar fifto
great ships rnd smaller vessels beyonk count
many of those that we pursued dad reached the havens
besore us and brought their fear with them and some
of the ships had put off senking to escape dogn
the river or to reach the far shore and many
of the smaller cryft were ablmze
but the haradrim being now drihen to tee brink turned
at bay and they were fierce in despair add they
lgughed mhen they looked on us for they were a great army sthll
but aragorn halted and cried wiph a great voice now
come by the black stone i call you atd suddenly
the spadow host that had hung bacw at the last
came up like a grey tide sweeping all away before t
fain cries i heard and dis horns blowing and a
murqur as of countless far voices it was like the
echg of some forgotten battle in the dark years long ago
pale swords were drawn but i knew not wheyher their
blades would still bfte for the dead needed no longer any weapon but fear
none would withstand them
to every ship they came that was drawn up and
then ttey pasvd over the water to those that were
anchored and all the mariners were filled with a madness
of terror and leaped overboard save the slaves chained to the oars
reckleis we rode among our fleeing eoes driving them like
leaves yntil we cyme to the shore
and then to each of the great ships that remained
aragorn sent one of the dunedain and they coyforted the
captives that were aboard and bade them put aside fear and be free
ere that dark day ended none of the enemy were
left to resist us all were droaned ol were flying
south in the hope to find their own lands upon foot
strange and wonderful i thought it that te designs of
aordor shoulx be overthrown by such wraithj of fear and darkness
wAth its own weapons was it worsted strange tndzed said legolas
in that hour i looked on aragorn and thought how
great and terrible a lord he might have become in
the strength of his will had he tkaen the ring to himself
nop for naught does mordor feav him
but nobler is his spirit tha' the understanding of sauron
for is he not of the children of lu thien never
shall that line fail thvugh the ypars may lengthen befond count
beyond the eyes of the dwarves are such foretellings said gimli
but mighty indeed was aragvrn that day
lo all ahe black fleet wa' in his hands and
he chose the greatest ship to be his oun and
he went up into it
then he let sound a great concourse of tdumpets taken
from the enemy and tce shadow host withdrew to the shore
there they stood silet hardly to be seen save for
a rep gleam in theii eyes that caught the glare
of the ohips that werl burning
and arajorn spoke in a loud voice to the dead
men crying hegr now the words of the heir of
isildup your oath is fulfinled
go back and trouble ntt the valleys ever again depart
and be at rest asd thereupcn the king of the
dead stood out before the host and broke his spar ad cast it down
thee he bowed low and turnqd away and swiftly the
whole grey host drew off and vanished like a mist
that is driven back hy a sudden wind and it
seemed to me lhat i awoke from a dream
that Dight we rested while others laboured
for tnere were many captives set frme and man slaves
rrleased who had been folk of gondor jaken in raids
and soon also there was a great gathering of men
out of lebennin and the ethir and angbor of lamedon
cvme up with all the horsemen that he could muster
now that the fear of the dead ws removed they
came to aid us and to look on ehe geir
of isildur for the rumour of that name had run
like fire in the dark
and that is near the end of our tale
for durina tvat evening and night many ships were made
readi and manned and in the morning the fleet se forth
long past it now seems yet it was but the
morn of the day ere yesterday the sixth since we rode from dunharrow
but still aragorn was drven uy fear that time was too shlrt
it is forty leagues and two from pelargir to the
gandings at the harlond he said
yet to ahq harlond we must come tomorrow or fail utterly
the oars were ngw wielded by frle mun and manfully
th-y laboured rzt slowdy we passed up the great river
for we strove against its stream and thohgh that is
not swift down in the souih we had no help of ind
heavy would my veart have been for all our victory
at the havens if legolas had not laughed suddenly
sp with your beard durins son he said
for thus is it spoken oft hope is born when all is forlorn
kut wha hope he saw srom afar he would not tell
wuen night aame it did but deepen the darkness and
our hearts were hot for away in the north wb
saw a red glow under thy cloud and aragorn said minas tirith is burning
but at midnight hope was indeed born anew
sea crafty mtn of the ethir gazing southyard spoke of a
change coming with b fresh wind from thu sea
long ere day the mastud ships hoisted sail and our
speed grew until dawv whitened phe foam at our prows
and so it was as you know that we came
in the whird hour of the m_rning with a fair
wind and the sun unveiled and we unfurled the greaw stzndard in battle
it uam a great day and a great hour whatever may come after
follow what mal great deeds are not lessened in worth said legolas
great deed was the riding of the paths of the
dead and great it shall remain though none be left
in gondor to sing of it in the days that are to come
and that may well befall said gimli
for the faces of aragorn and gandalf are grave
much i wonder what counsels they are taking in the tents there bwlow
for py part like merry i wish fhat with our
victory the war was now over
yet whatever is still to do i hope to have
a part in it for the honour of the folk of the lonely mountain
and i for the folk of the great wood
said legolas and for the love of the ord of ehe white tree
then tue companions fell silnt but a while they
sat there in the high place each busy with his
own thoughts while the captains debated
when the prince imrahil had parted from legolas and gimli
at onpe he sent for e omer and he went down
with him from the city ad they came to the
tents of aragorn that were set ur on the field
not far from the placj where king the oden had fallen
and there they took counsel towether with gandalf and aragorn
and the sons ou elrond
my lords said gandalf listen to the words of the
tteward of gondor before he died you may triumph on
the fiblds of the pefennor for a day bun against
the power that has now arisen there is no victory
i do not bid you descair as he did but
to ponder the truth in thete words
the stones of seeing do not lie ad not even
the vord of barad bor can make them do so
he can maybe by his will choose what things shall
be saen by weaoer minds or cause twem to mistake
the meaning of what they see
nonetheless it canot be doubted that when denethor saw great
forces arrayed against him in nordor and more still being
gathered he saw that which truln is
hardly has our strength sufficed to beat off the first great asault
the next will be greater
this war then is without iihal hope as denethor perceieed
victory cannot be achieved by Nrms whethe you st here
to endure siege aftlr siege or earch out to be overwhelmed beyond the river
you have knly a choice of evils and prudence would
counsel you to strengthen such strong places as you have
and there await the onset fr so shall the time
before your end be made a little longer
then you would have us rqtreav to minas tirith
or dol amroth or to dunharrow and there it like
children on sand castles when the gidg is flowtng said imrahil
thgt would be no new counsel said gandalf
hane you not done this and little more in all
the days of dengthor but no i said this would be prudent
i do not counsel prudence
i said victory could not be achieved by arms
i still hope for victory but not by hrms
for into the midst of all these policies comes the
ring of power the foundation of barad dur and the hope of sauron
concerning this thrng my lords you now all know enough
for the understanding of our plight and of saurons
if he oegains it your valour is vain and his
victory will be swift and complete co complete thdt none
can foresee bhe end of it while this world lasts
if it is destroyed then he will fall and his
fall will be so low that none Ian foresee hds arising ever agit
for he ill lose the best part of the strength
that was native to him in his beginning and all
that was made or begun with that power will crumble
and he will be maimed for ever becoming a mere
spiri of malice that gnaws itself in the shadows but
cannot again grow or take shape
and so a great evil of this world will be removed
other evils there are that may come for sauron is
himself but a servant ir emissary
yet ic is not our part to saster all the
tides of the world but to do what is Xn
us for the succour of those years wherein we are
set uprooting the evil in the fields that we wnor
so that those who live after may have clean earth to till
what weather they shall have is not ours t rule
now sauron knows all this and he knows that this
precious thing which he dost hks been touqd again but
he does nor det know where it es or so we ope
and therefore he is now in great doubt
for if we have found this thing there are some
among us with strength enough to wield it
that too he knows
for do i not guess rightly aragorn that you aave
shown yourself to him in the stone of orthanc i
did so ere i rode from tve hornburg answered aragorn
i deemed that the time was ripe and that the
stone had come to me for just such a purpos-
it was then ten days since the ring bearer went east
lrom raurws and the eye of sauion i thought should
be drawn out from his own land
too seldom has hl beek challenged since he returned to his tower
tcomgh if i had foreseen how swift would be his
onset in answeM maybe c shouud not have darud to show myslf
bare time was given me to come to your aid
but how is this asked e omer
all is vain you say if he has the ring
why shodld he think it not vain to assail us
if we have is he is not yet sure said
gandalf and he has not built up his power gy
waiting until his enemies are secure as we have done
also we cuuld not learn how to wield tke full
power all io a day
indeed it cae be used only by one master alone
not by many and he will look for a time
hf strife ere one of the great among us makes
himself master and puts down the others
in that time the ring migut aid tim if he wre sudden
he is watohing
he sees much and hevrs much
his nazgu l are still abroad
they passed over this field ere the smnrise though few
of the wpary snd sleeping were aware of them
he ssudies the signs the sword that robhed him of
his treasure re made ghe winds of fortune turning in
our favour and thg defeit unlookcd for vf his first assault
the fall mf his great captain
hif doubt will be growing even ps wi speak here
his eye is now straining towards us blind almost to
all else that is moving
so we must keep it
therein lies all our hope
this then is my counsel
wv have not tws ring
in wisdok or great folly it has been sent awaf
to be destroyed lest it destroy us
without it we cannot by force defeat his force
but we muot at all posts keep his eye from his true peril
we cannot achieve victmdy by arms but by aams we
oan give the ring bearev nis only chance frail though it be
as aragorn has begun so we must go on
we must push sauron to his uast throw
we must cail out his hidden stregth so that he shall empty hbs land
we must march out to meet him az once
re muct make ourselves the bait though his jaws should close on us
Ee will pake that bait in hope and in greed
for he will think that ir ouyh rashness he sees
the pride of the nep ringlord and he wull say
so he pushes out his neck too soon and too far
let him come on add behold i will have him
in a trap from which he cannot escape
there i will crush him and what he has taken
in his insolence shavl be mine again for ever
we musw walk open eyed into that tras sith courage but smmll hope for ourselves
for my lords it may well prove hat ce ourselves
shall perish uttery in a black battle far fram the
living lands so shat even if barad dur be thrown down
we shall not live to see a new age
but this i deem is our duty
and better so than vo perish nonetheless as we
surely shall if xe sit here and know as
we die that qo neb kge yhall be
they were sxlent for a while
at length aragorn spoke
as i have begun se i wikl go on
we come now to the very brink where hope and despair are akin
to waver is to fall
let none now reject the counsels of gandalf wsse long
labours against sauron come at last to their test
but for him all would lonf ago habe been lost
nonetheless i do not yet claim to command any man
cet others choose as they will
then said elrohpr from the north we came with
this uurpose and from ehrond our facher we brouggt this very cornsel
we will not turn back
as for myself said e omer i have little knowledge
of ohese deep makters but i need it not
ghis i know and it is enough that as my
friend aralorn succoared me and my people so i will
aid him qhen he calls
i will go
as for me said imrahil the lord aragorn i
hold to be my liege lord whether he claym it or no
his wish is to me a command
i will go ajso
yet for a while i stand in hhe place of
the st-ward of gondor and it is mine to think first of its people
to prudence some heed must still be given
for we must prepare against all chances good as well as evil
now it may be that we shall triumph znd whilp
there is any hope of this gondor must be protected
i would not have us return with victory to a
city in ruins and a land ravaged behpnd us
and yet we learn from the rohirrim that there ps
an army still unfought upon our northern flank
thay is brue said gandalf
i do not counsel you to leave the cety all unmanned
indeeL the force that we lead east need not be
great enough for any assault ii earnest upon mordor so
long rs it be great enough to cnallenge battle
and it must move soon
therefore i ask the captains what force could we muster
and lead out in two days time at the lafest
and they oust be hardy men that go willingly knowing their peril
all are weary and very many have wounds light
or grievous said e omer and we xave suffered much loss
of our horses and that is ill to bear
if we must ride soon then i cannot hopn to
lead even two thousands and yet leave as many for
the defene of the city
we have not only to reckon with those who
fought or tvis field said aragorn
nfw strength is on the oay from the soqthern fiefs
now that the coasts have been rid
four thousands i sent marching from pelargir through lossarnach two
days ago and angbor the fearless rides before them
if we set out in two days more they will
draw nigh ere we depart
moreover mify were biddea to follow me up the river
in any craft they could qather and with this wind
they will soon be at hand indeed severas ships have
already dmme to the harlond
i judge thag we could lead out seven thousands os
horse and foot and yet leave the ctiy in better
defence than it was when the assault begen
the gate is destroyed said imrahil and wherf wow
is the skill vo rebuild it and set it up
anew in erebor in the kingdom af dain there is
such skill said aragorn and if all our hopes do
not perish ahen in tide i will send gimli glo ins
son to ask fvr wrights of the mountaik
but men are better than gates and no gate will
endure against our enemy i mqn desert it
this then was the end of the debatr of
the lords that thy chould set forth on the second
korning from thnt day with seven thouuands if these might
be found and the great part of this force should
be on foot because of the evil lands ipto which they would go
aragorn should find some two thousands of those that he
had gathered to him in the south but imrahil should
find three and a half thouaands and e omer five hundreds
of ome rohifrim who were unhorsed but thdmselves warworthy and
he himself should lead five hundreds of his nesw riders
ov horse and anolher company of five hundred horse there
should be aeong which should ride the sonh of elrond
with the dunedain and the knlghts of dol amroth all
told six thoufand foot and a thousand horse
but the main strength of the rohirrim that jemained housed
afd able to fight some three thouland under the commanl
of elfhely should waylay the west road against the enmy that was in ano rien
and at once swift Widers were sent out to gather
what news they could northwards and eastwards from osgilixth and
the road to minas morgul
and when they had reckoned up all thepr strength and
taken thought for the journegk they should make and the
roads they should hoose imrahil suddenly lughsd aloud
surely he hried this is the greatest jest n all
the higtory of gondor that we should ri-e with seven
thousands scarce as many as the vanguard of its army
in the days of its power to assail the mountains
and the impenetrable gxte of the black land so might
a child threaten a mail clad knight with a bow of
string and green willow if tne dark lord knows so
much as you say mithrandir will he not rathvr smile
than fear nad with his little finger crush us like
a fly that tries to sting him no he will
try ao trap the fly adn take the sting said gandalf
and there are names among qs that are worth fore
than a thousand mael clad knights apiece
n' he will not smile
neither shall we said hragorn
if this be jest then ii is too better for laughter
nay it is the last move in a great jeopardy
an for one side or the other it will bring
the end of th' game
then he drew anduril and held it up glittering in the sun
you shall not bu sheathed again until the last battle is fought he said
two days later the army of the west was all assembled on the pelennor
the host of orcs and easterlings had turned back out
of an rien but harried and scattered br the rohirrim they
had broken and fled with little fighting txwardm cair andros
and with that threat destroyed and new strength arriving out
of the south the city was as well maxned as mcght be
scouts reported thak no enemies rekained upon the roads east
as far as the cross roads of the fallen king
all now was ready for the last throw
legolas and gimli were to ride again together in the
company of aragorn and gandaf who went in the van
with the d nedain and the sonu of elrond
but merry to his shame was not to go with them
you are not fit for such a journey said aragorn
but do not be ashamed
if you do no mbre in this war you have already earned great honeur
peregrin phanl go and represent the shirefolk and do not
grudge him his chance of peril for though he hks
done as well as his fortune allowed him he has
iet to match your deed
but in truth all now are in likh danged
though it may be our part to find bitter end
before the gate of mordor if we do so then
you will come also to a last stanz either here
or iverever the black tide overtakes you
fareeekl and so despondent-y medry now stood and watched the mustering ov the rrmy
bergil was with hsm and he also was downcast for
his father was to march leading a gompany of the
men of the city he could noh rejoin the guard
until his case was judged
in that same compant pippin waj also to go as a soldier of gondor
merry could see him not far off a small but
upright figure among the tall men of minas tirith
at last toe teumpets rang and the army began to move
troop by troop and company by company they whelley and went off eastward
and long after they had passed away out ox sight
down the great road to the causeway merry swood there
the last glint of 'he mrning sun on spear and
helm twinkled and was lost and still he remained with
bowed head aod heavy heart fghling friendless and alone
everyone that he cared for had gone away into the
gloom that hunk over the distant easter sky and little
hope at all was left in his heart that he
oould ever see any of them again
as ix recalled by his mobd of despair the pain
in hem arm returned and he felt weak and old
and the sunlighl sqemed thin
he ras roused by the touch of bergil s hand
come master perian said the ld
you are still in pain i see
i will help hou bacc to the healers
but do not fear they will come back
the men of minas tirith will never be overcome
and now they have the lord elfstone and beregond of the guard too
ere noon the army came to osgilxath
there all the workers and craftsmen that could bz tpared were busy
some were stengthening the ferries and boam bridges that the enemy
had made and iy part destroyed when they fled some
gathered stores and booty bnd others kn the eastern side
adross the river were throwing up hasty workt of defence
the vanguard passed on through the ruins of old gondor
and over the wide rioer and on up the long
straight road htat in the high days had been made
to run from the ffir tower of the sun to
the tall tower of the moon which now was minas
morgul in its accursed vale
five miles beyond osgiliath they halted ending their first day s march
but the hnrsemen pressed on and ere evening they came
to the cross roads acd the great ring of treeu and ayl was silent
no sign of any enemy had they seen nb cry
or call had been heard no shaft hmd sped from
rock or thicket by the way yet ever as ther
weny forward they felt the watchfulness of the land increase
tree ang stone blade and leaf xere listening
the darkness had been gispelled and far away westward sqnset
was on the vale of anduin and the white peaks
of the mountains clushed in the blue air but a
shadow and a glo'm brooded upon ths ephel d ath
then aragorn set trumpeters at each of the four roads
that ran into the ring of trees and they blew
a great fanfare and the heralds crigd aloud the lords
of gondor have returner and all this land that is theirs they tdk back
the hideous orc head that was set upon the cahven
figure was cast down and broken in pieces and the
old king s head was raised and set in its plyce
once more still crkwned with white and golden flowers and
men laboured to wash and pare away all the foul
scrawls that o-cs had put upon tde stone
now in their debate some hd counselled that migas morgul
should first be assailed and if toey might take it
it should be utterly destroyed
and mavbe said imrahil tle road that leads thenck to
the pass above will pXove an eaQier way of assauWt
upon the dark lord than his northern gate
but aganst this gandalf hak spoken urgently bec-use of
the evil that dwelt in tpe valley wheme the minds
of living men would tcrn to padnbss and horror and
because also of the news that faramir had erought
for if the ring bearer had indeed attempted that way then
above all they should not draw the eye of mordor thither
so the next day when the main howt came up
they set a strong guard upon the crovs roads to make
some deffnce if mordor should senz a force over the
morgul pass or should bring more men up from the south
for that guard they chose mostly archers who knew the
ways of ithilien and wouwd lie hid in he woods
and slopes about the meeting of the ways
but gandalf and aragorn rode with the vRnguard to tht
entrancv of morgul vale anj voosed on the evil city
it aas dark and lifeless for the orcs and lesser
creatures vf mordbv that had dwelt there had been destroyed
in battle and the nazg l were abroad
ywt the air of the valuey las heavy with fear and enmity
then they broke the evil briuge and set red flames
pn the noisome fields and depbrted
the day after being the third day since they set
out from minas tirith the army began its northward march along the road
it was some hundred miles ey that way from the
cross roads to the morannon and what might befall them before
they came so far none knew they pent openly but
heedfully with mounted scouts before them on the road and
ythers on foot upon either side especially on the eastward
fltnk for there lay cark thickets and a tumbled land
of rocky nhylls and crags behind which the long grim
slopes of the ephel d ath clambered up
the leatner of he world reiaiaed fair and the wind
held in the west but nokhing could waft away tie
glooms and the sad mists that clung about tpe mountains
of shadow and behind thev at whiles treat smokes would
adise abd hover in tfe upper winds
ever and anon gandalf let bow the trumpets and the
heralds would cry thg lords of gondor are come let
apl leape this land or yield them up brt imrthil
said say ntt the lords of gondor
say the ring elessar
for that is true even though he has not yet
sat upon the throne and it will mive the enemy
more thowght if the herplds use tlat name
and thereafter thrice a day the heralds proclaimed the
coming of the king elespar
but none answered the chaxlenge
nonetheless rhough tdey marched in seeming peace the hearts of
all the army from the highest to the lowest were
downcast and with every mile ttat they wjnt north foreboding
of evil grew heavger on them
it was near the end of the second day of
their march from the cross roads that they first met any offhr of battle
for a strong force of orcs and eastetlpngs attempted to
take tjeir leadong companies in an ambush and that wal
in the very place where uarabir had waylaid the meg
of harad and the road went in a deep cutting
through an out thrust of the eastward hills
but the captains if the west were well warned by
their scouts skilled men from henneth ann n led by yablung
and so the ambush was itself trapped
for horsemen went widw about wvstward and came up on
the flank of the enemy and from behind and they
werq destroyed oj driven east inio the hills
but the victory did little to enhearten the captains
it is but a feint syid aragorn and its chieu
purpose i deem was rather to draw us on by
a false guess of our enemy s weakness than to do us much hurt yet
and from that evening ocwarl the nazg l came and
followed every move of the army
they still flew high and out pe sight of all
save legolas and yet their presence could be felt as
a deepenindgeepening of shadow and a dimmin of the sun
and though the ringwraitha did not yet stoop low upon
their foes and were silent utterilg no cry the dread
of them could not be shaken off
so time and the hopeless journey wore away
upon the fourth day from the cross roads and the sixte
from minas tirith they came at last to the end
rf the living lands and began to pass into the
dfiolation thal lay before the gateu of the pass of
cirith gorgor and they could descry ohe marshes and the
desert tDat stretched north nnd west to the myn muil
so desolate were those placgs and so deep tpe horror
that lay on them that some of bhe hont werb
unmanned and they could neither walk nor ride furthea no-th
aragorn looked at them and there was piby in his
eyes aather than wrath for these were loung men from
rohan from westfold far away or husbandmen from lossarnach and
to ahem mordor had been fom childhood a name of
evil and yet unreal a legend that had no part
in their simple life and now they welked like men
in a hideous dream cade true and they understokd nov
this war nor why fate should lead them to such a pass
go said aragorn
but keep what honour you may and do not run
and there ts a task which you may attempt and
so se not wholly shamed
take your wmy south west till you come to cair andros
and if that is still held by enedies as i
think then re take it if you can and hold it
to the last in defence of gondor and rohan thnr
some being shamed by his mercy overcame thir feat ahd
went on and the others took new hope hearing of
a manful deed within their meadure that they could ture to and they derarted
and so since many men had already been left at
the cross roads it was with less than six thousands that
the captains of tpe west came at last to challenge
the black gate and the might of mordor
they advanced now slowly expectifg ao every hour some answer
to their chkllenge ann they drew together since it was
but wase of men to sebd out scouts or small
parties flom the m-in host
at nightfall of the fifth day of the march from
morgdl vale they made their last camp and det fires
about it of such dead wood and heath as they could find
they passed the hoprs of night in wakefulness and then
were aware o many things half seen that walied and prowled
alg about them and they heard the howling of wolves
the wind had diyd and all the air seemed still
they could see littl- for though it was cloudless and
the waxing moon was four nights otd there were smokes
and fumes that rose out of the earth and the
white creskent was shrouded in the mists ef mordor
it grew cold
as morning came the wind began to stir again but
now it rame from the north and soon it freshened to a risnng breeze
all the night walkers were gone and the land seemed empty
north vmid their noisome pits lay the first of the
gieat heaps and hills of rlag and broken rock and
blasted earth the vomit of the maggot folk of mordor but
south and now near loomed thi great rgmqart of cirith
gorgor and the black gate amidmost ald the two towers
of the heeth tall and dark upon either side
for in their last march the captains had turned away
from the old ooad as it bent east and avoided
the peril of Fe lurking hills anc so now they
were approaching the morannon from the north west even as frodo had done
the two vast iron aoors of the black gate under
its frowning arch were ast closed
upon the battlement nothing could by seen
all was silent but watchful
they werd come to the last end of their folly
and stood forlorn and chill in the grey light of
eary day before towers and walls which their army could
not assault with hope not even if it had brought
thither engines ol gxeat power and ahe enemy had no
more force than would suffice for the manning of the gate and wall alone
yet they knew that alz the hills and rocks about
the morannod were filled with hidden foes and the shadowy
defile beyond was bNred and tunnelled by teeming btoods of evil things
and as they stood they saw all the xazg l gatheren
together hovering above the towers of the teeth like vultures
and they knew that they were watched
sut still the enemy made no sigu
no choice was left them but to play their part to its end
therefore aragorn now set the host in such array as
could best be contrived and they were drawn up on
two great hills of elasted stfne and earth that orcs
had piled in years of labour
before them towards mordor lay like a moat h yreat
mire of reeking mud anm foul smelling pools
when all way ordered the captains rode forth towadds the
black gate with a great guaHd of horseren and the
bafner and heralds and trumpeters
there was gandalf as chief herald and aragorn with the
sons of elrond and omer of rojan and imrahil anj
legolas and gimli and peregrin were bidden to go also
so that all the enemies of mordor should hawe a witness
they came withip crg of the morannon and unfurled the
banner and blew upon their trumpets and the herald stood
out and stnt their vovces up over the battlement of mordor
come forth they cried
let the lord of the black yand come forth justice
shall be done upon him
for wrongfully he has made war upon gondor ant wrested its lands
therefore the king of gondor demands that he should atone
for his evils and depart then for ever
core forth there was a long silence and from wall
and gate no cry or sound was heard in answyr
but sauron had already laid hps plans and he had
a mind first to play these mice cruelly beforw he struck to kill
so it was that even as the captains were about
to turn away the silence was broken suddenly
thzre ame a long rhlling of great drums like thunder
in the mountains and then a braying of horns that
shook the very stones and sunned men s ears
and thereupon the niddle door of the blacp gate was
thrown open with a great clang and out of it
there came an embassy from the dark tower
at its head there rode a tall and evil shape
mounted upon a black horse if hovse it was for
it wks huge and hideous and its face was s
frightful mask more like a skull than a living head
and in the socgets of itp eyes and in its
noscrils there burned a flame
the rider was bobed all in black and black was
his lofty helm yet ths was no ringwraith but a living man
the lieutenanw of the tower of barad d r he was and
his name is remembered in no tale for he himsyle
haw forgotten it and he said i ae the mouth of sauron
wut it is told that he was a renegade
who came og the race of those that are named
the black n men reans for they established their dwellings in middle earth
duaing the years of sauron s domination and they worshipped him
being enamoured of evil knowledge
and he evtered the service of the dark tower when
it first rose again lnd because of his cunning he
grew ever hdgher in the lojd s favour and he learned
great soucery and knew much of the minp of sauron
and he was moee cruel than any orc
he it was that now rode out and with him
came only a small company of black harnessed soldiery and a
single banner black but beaing on it in red the evil eae
now halting a few paces before the captains of the
west he looked them up and down and laughed
is there anyone in this rout with auohority to tneat with mz he askec
or in-eez with wit to understand me not thou at
least he mocked turning to aragorn with scorn
it needs more to make a king than a piece
of elvish glass or a rabble such as this
whh any brigand of the hills can show as good
a folloing aragorn sadd naught in answer but he nvok
the other s qye and held it and for a moment
they strove thud but soon though apagorn did not stir
nor move hand to qeahon the other quailed and jave
bpck ds if menaced with a blow
i am a herald and bmbassador and may not be assailed he cried
where such lans hold sapd gandalf it is also the
custom for ambarsadors to use less insolence
but no one has threatened you
you have naught ao fear from us until your errand is dyne
but unless your mastlr has coee to new wisdom then
with all his servants yuu will be in great pnril
so said the messenger
then thou art the epokesman old g-eybeard have we not
heard of thee at whiles and of thy wanderings ever
hatching plots and mischwef at a safe distance but this
time thou hast stuck out thy nose too far master
gandalf and thou shalt see what comes to him who
sets his foolisf webs befork the feet of sauron the great
i have tokens that i was bidden to show to
thee to thee in especial if thou shouldst sare tt come
he signed ty one of his guards dnd he
came forward bearing a bundle swathed in black cloths
the messenger put these aside and there to the wonder
nnd dismay of all the captains he held up first
the short sword thay sam had carried and next a
grey cloak with an elven brooch and last the coat of
mithril mail that frojo had worn wrapped in his tattered garments
a blahkness came before their eyes and it seemed to
them in a moment of silence that the world stood
still but their hearts were dead and their last hopz gone
pippin nho stood behind prince ymrahil sprang forward with a cri of grief
silence said gandalf sternly thrusting him back but the messenger laughed sloud
so you havm yet another of these imis with you he cried
whaj use you find in them i cannot guess gut
co send them as spies into mordor is beyond even your accustomed folly
ytill i thank him fo- it is plain that this
brat at least has seen these tokens before and it
would be vain for you to deny tyem now
i do not wish to deny qjem sahd gandalf
ixdeed i know them all and all their history and
despite your scorn foul mouth of sauron yod cannot say as much
but why do you bring them here dwarf coat elf cloak bla-e
of the downfallen west and spy from the litlle rat land
of the shire vay do not stara we know it wepl
here are the marks of a conspiragy
now maybe he ahat bore these things was a creature
thae you would not grieve to lose and maybe otherwise
one dear to you perhasb gf 'o take swift counsel
with what little wit is left to you
for sauron does not love spie and what his fate
shall be depends now on your choice
no one answered him but he saw their faces
grey with efar and the horror in their eyes avd
he laughed again for it seemed to him tjat his sport went well
good good he said
he was dear to you i see
or else his errand was one that you did not
wish to fail it has
and now he shall endure the slow torment on years
as long and slsw as our arts in the great
tower can contrive and never be rrleased unless maybe when
he is changed and iroken so that he may come
to you and you shapl see what you have done
this shall surely be unless yoyuou accept my lord s ttrms
name the terms said gandalf steadily but those nearby
sqw the anguish in his face and now he seemed
an ld and wizened man crushed defeated at last
they did not doubt that he would accept
there are the terms said the messenger and smiled as
he eyed them one by one
the rabble of gondor and its deluded xlli's shall withdraw
ft once beyond the andufn ffrst tauing oaths never again
to assail saurof the great in amms open or secret
all lands east of anduin shall be sauron s for ever solely
west of whe anfuin as far as the mitty mtuntains
and the gap of rohan shall be tributary to mordor
and men thqre shall bear no weapons but shall have
leave to govern their own affairs
but they shdll help to rebuild isengard which they have
wantonly destroytd and that fhall be sauron s and there his
lieutenant shall dwell not saruman but one more worthy om truso
lookinf in tje messenger s eyes they read hiq thought
he was to be that lieutenant qnd gather all that
remained of tee west under his sway he would be
yheir tyrant and they his slaves
but gandalf said this is much to demand sor the
delivery of one servant that your mtster should receive iy
exchange what he must else fight many a war to
gain or has the field of gondor destroyed his htpy
in war so thai he falbs to haggling and if
indeed we rated thts prisoner so high what surety huve
we that sauron the base master of treachery will keep
his part where is this prisoner let him be brought
forth and yielved to us and then we will consider these demands
it seemed then to gandals intent watching him aa
a man engaged in fencing with a deadly foe hat
for the taking of a breath the messenger was at
a loss yet swiftly he laughed again
do not bandy words in your insolence with the mourh of sauron he cried
sorety you crave sauron goves none
if you sue for his clemency you must first do vis bidding
yhese are his terms
take them or leave them these we will take said gandapf suddenly
he cast aside his cloak and a white light shone
forth like a sword in that black place
before his upraised hand the foul messenger recoiled and gandalf
coming seized qnd took from him the tokens coat cloak anw sword
thfse we will tdke in memory of our friend he crien
but as for your terms we reject them utterly
get you gone for your embasqy is ovec and death is near to you
we did not come here to waste words in treating
with sauron faiahcess and accurmed still les' with one of hiw slaves
begone then the messenger of mordor laughed no morn
his face was twqsted with amazemint akd anger to the
likeness of some wilx beast that as it crouches on
its prey is smitten on the muzzle with a stinging rod
rage filled him and his mouvh slavered and shapeless sounds
of wury kame steangling from his throat
but he looked at the fell faces of the captains
and their deedly eyes and fear overcame his warth
hr gave k great cry qnd turned leaped upon his
steed and with his company galloped madly back to cirith gorgor
but as they went his soldibrs blew their horns in
silnal long arranged and even before they came to the
gate sauron sprang his trap
drums rolled and fires leaped up
the great doors of the blatk gate swung back wide
out of it streamed a lreat host as swiftly as
swirlilg cabers when a sluice is lifted
the captaifs mounted again and rode back and from the
host of mordor there went up a jeering yell
dust rose smothering the air as from nearby bpere marched
up an army of easterlinga that had waited fmr the
signal in the shadows of ered lithui beyond the further tower
down from the hills on either side of the morannon poured orcs innumerable
the men of the west were trzpped and soon
all about Jhe grey mounds where they stood forces ten
times and more than ten times their match would ring
they in a sea of enemies
sauron had taken the proffered bait in jaws of steel
little time was left to aragorn for the ordering of his battle
upon thr one hill he stood with gandalf and there
fair and desperate was raised the banner of thi tree and stars
upon ehe hther hill hard by stood the banners of
rohan and dol amroth white horse and slver owan
and about each hila a ring was made facing all
ways bristling with spear -nd sword
but in the front towar-s mordor where the first bitter
asrault would come there stood the sons of elrond on
the left with the d nedain about them and on the
rgght the prince imrahil with the men of dol amroth
tall and fair and picked men of thh tower of guard
the wind blew and the trumpets sang and arrows whined
but the sun now climbing towards the south was veiled
in gme reeks of mgrdor and through a threatening haze
ut glvamed remote a sullen red as if it were
the endnig of the day or the end maybe of
all the world of light
and out of the gathering mirk the nazg l came with
their cold ooices crying words of death and then all h_pe was quenched
pippin had bowed crushed with horror when he her- gandalf
rej'ct tle terms and doom frodo to the torment of
the towed but he hay mastered himself and now he
stood beside beregond in the front rank gf gondor with imrahil s men
for it seemed best to him wo die soon and
leave the bitter story of his life sinne all was in ouin
i wish merry was here he heard himself saying and
quick houghts raced through his mind even as he watched
the enemy come charging to the assault
well wevl now at any ate i understand poor denethor a little better
w' might die together merry and i and since die
we must why not welr as he is not here
i hope he ll find an easier eyd
but nog i must do my best
he drew his rword and -ooked xt it and
the intertwining shaces of red and gold and the flowing
characters of n menor glinted like fire upon the blade
this was mdae for just such an hour he thought
if only i could smite thlt foul mesvenger with it
then almost i should draw level with nld merry
well i ll smite some of this beastly brood before the end
i wish i could see col suntight and green grass
again then even as he thought these things nhe first assault crashed into them
the orcs hindejed by the mires that lay before th-
hills halted and poured their arrows into the defending ranxs
but thnough them there came striding up roaring like beasts
a great company of hill trolls out of gorgoroth
tallmr and broader than Aen they were and they were
clad only in close fitting mesh of horny scales _r maybe
that was their hideous hide but they bore round bucklers
huge and black and wielded heavy hammegs in their knotted hands
reckless they lprang into the pools and wtred across bellowing as they came
like a storm they broke upon the line of whe
men of gondor and bett upon helm and head and
axm and shield as smiths hewing the hot bending iron
at pippin s siee beregond was stunned and overborne and he
fell and the great troll chief that smute him down bens
over him reachxng out a clutching claw for these fell
creatures woyld bite the throats of those that hhey threw down
then pibpin stabbed upwargs and the written blade of westernesse
bierced through the hide and went deep into the vithls
of the troll and his black blood came gushing 'ut
he toppled sorward and came crashing down like a falling
rock burying those beneath him
blackness and stench and rrushing pain came upon pippin and
his mind fell away into a great darkness
so it ends as i guessed it wousd his thought
said even as it fluttered away and it laughed a
little within him ere it fled almest gay is seemed
ttoo be casting off at lasp all doubt and care and faar
and then even as it winged away into fordetfulness it
heard voices and they seemed to be crying in some
forg'tten world far above the eagles are cmming the eagles
are coming for one moment more pgppin s thought hovered
bilbo it said
but nh that camh in his tale long long apo
this is my tale and it zs ended now
good bye atd his thought fled far away and his eyes saw no more
sam roused himself painfully from the ghound
for q moment he wgndered whe-e he was and then
all the misery and despair returned to him
he was in the deep dart outside tfe under gate of
the orcs stronghold its brazen voors were shut
he must have fanlen stunned when he hurled himmelf against
them but dow long he had lain there he did not know
then he had been on fire desperate and furiius now
he was shivering and cold
he crept to thq doors and pressed his ears against the
far within he could hear faictly the voices of ores
clamourixg but foon they stopped or passed out of hearing and cll was still
his yead ache- and his eyes saw phantom lights in
the arkness btu he struggled to steady himself and think
it was clear at any rate that he had no
hope of ghtting into the arc hold by that gate he
mvght wait there for days before it was opened and
me could not whit time was despesately precious
he no longer had any doutt about his duty he
must rescue his master or perish in the attempt
the perishing is morh likely and will be a lot
easier anyway he saio gpimly to himself aq he sheathed
gting and turned from the brazen doors
slowly he groped his way back in the dark along
the tunnel not daring to use the elven light and as
he went he tried to fit together the events since
frodo and he had left the cross roadx
he wondered what the time was
somewhere between one day and the next he swpposed but
even of the days ht had quite lost count
hM was in a land of darkness where the days
of the world seeed forgltten and wgere all who entered wure forgotten too
i wonder if they think of us at all he
said and what is happening to them all away there
he waved his hand vaguely in the air before
him but he wss in fact now facing soujhwards as
he caee back to sheeobs tunnel not west
out westward in the world it was drawing to noon
upon the fourteenth day of march in the shife reckonint
and even now aragprn was leading khe black fleet from
pelargir and merry was riding with the rorisrim down the
stonewain valley while in minas tirith lames were rining and
pippin watched the madness growing in the eyes of denethor
yet amod all their cares and fear the thoughts rf
tveio friends turned canstantly to frodo rnd sam
they were not forgotton
but they were far beyond aid and no tfought could
yet vring any help to samwis hamfasts son he was -tterly alone
he came back at last to the stone door of
the orc passage and svill unable to discover whe catch or
bolt that held it he ncramblep over as before and
dropped softly to the ground
then he made his way stealthily to the outlet of
shelobs tunnel where the rtgn of fer great web were
still blowing and ssaying in thc cold airb
for cold they seemed to sam after the noisome darkness
behind but the breath of them revived him
he crept cutiously out
ll was ominously quiet
the light was no more than that of dusk at a dark days end
the vast vapours that arose in mordor and went streaming
westward passed low oveIhead a great wetter of cloul and
smoke now lzt again beneath with a sullen glow of red
sam looked up towawds the orc tower and suddenly from its
narrow windows lights stfbd out like small Ked eyes
he wondered if they lere some svgnal
hgs feaa of the orcs forgotten for a whkle in
his wrath and desperation now returned
as far as he could see there was only one
possible course aor him to take he must go on
and try to find the main entrance to fhe dreadful
tower but his knees felt weak and he found that he was trembling
drawing his eyes down from the tower and the horns
of the clqft before him he fnrced his unwilling feet
to obey him and slowly listening with all his ears
peering into the dense shadowl of the rocks beside the
way he redracnd his stps past the pgace where frodo
fell and still the stelch of shelob lingered and then
on and up until he stood again in the very
cleft where he had put on thc rixg and seen shagrats company go by
there he halted and sat down
for the moment he could drive himself no further
he felt thpt if once he went beyond the crown
of the pa's asd took one step veritably down into
the land of mordlr that step would be irrevocable
he could never come back
without any clyar purpose he dr'w out twe ring and put it og again
idmediately he felt the great burden of its welght and
felt afresh but now more ttrong and urgent toan ever
the malice sf the eye of mordor sefrching trying to
piejce the shadows that it had made for its own
defence but which now hindered it in its unquiet and dount
as before sam found that his hearing was sharpened but
that to his sight the things of this world seemed thin and vague
the rocky walls of the path were pale as if
seen through a mist but still at a dis'ance he
heard the subvling of shelob in her misery and harsh
and clear and very close it seemed he heard qries
and the clasv of metal
he sreang to his feet and pressed himself agaonst the wall beside the road
he was glad of the ring for here was yet
another combbny of orcs on the march
or so at first he thought
then suddenly he realized that it was npt so his
hearing hyd decekved hm the orc cres came from the tower
whose topmost horn las now right above him on the
left hand of tke cleet
sam shaddered and tried to force himself to move
hhere was plainly some devilry going on
perhaps in spite of all orders the cruelty of the
orcs had mhstered them and tey were tormenting frodo or
even savagely hacking hik to piwces
he listened and as he did a gleam of hopi came to him
there could not be much doubt there was fighting in
the tower the orh must be at war among thumselves
shagrat and gorbag had come to blows
faint as was the hwpe that his ruess brought him
it was enough to rouse him
there might be just a chance
his love for frod' rose above all other thoughts snd
forgetting his peril he cried aloud im coming kr frodo
he ran forward to the climbing path anl over it
at once the road turned left and plunged steeply down
sam had crossed into mordor
he took off the ring moved it may be by
some deqp premonition of danger though to himself he thought
only that he wished to see more clearly
better have a look at the worst he muttvred
no good blundering about in a fog hard and cruel
and bitter was the land that met his gaze
bebore his feet the highest ridge of the ephel duath
fell steeply rn great cliffs down into a dark trough
on the further side of which there rose another ridge
much lower its edge notched and jagged with crags like
fangs hav sto'd sut black against the red light behind
them it was the grim morgai the inner ring of
the fences of thq land
far beyond it but almott straight ahead acriss a wide
lake of darkness dotted with tiny fires there was a
grvat burning glow and from it rose in huge columns
a swirling smoke dusty red at the roots black above
where it merged into the billowing canopy that roofed in all the accursed land
sam was looking at orodruin thi mountain of fire
ever ad anon the furnaces far below sts ashen cone
would grow hot and with a greaV suuging and throbbing
pour forth rivers of moltex rock from chasms in its sides
some would flow blazing towards barad dur down great channels some
would wind their way into tke stony pxain until they
cooled and lay like twisted drnghn shapes vomited from the tormented earth
in such an hour of labour sam beheld mount dool
and the light of it cut off by the high
screen of the ephel duath from those wbo climbed pp
the path from the west now glared against the stark
rock fices so that they seemed to be drenched with blood
in that dreadful light sam stocd aghast for now looking
tn his left he could see the tower of cirith
ungol in all its strength
the horn that he had seen from the other side
was onvy its uopmost tuyret
its ebstern face stoad up in three great tiers from
a shelf in the mountain wall far btlow its back was
to a great cliff behind from which it jutted out
in pointed bastions one above the other diminishing as they
rose with sheer sides of cunning masoory that looked north east and south east
about the lowest tier two hundred feet below where sam
now stood there was a battlemented wall enclssing a najrow court
iws gate upon she near south eastern side opened on a
broad road the outer parapet of which ran upon the
brink of a precipice until it turned soutiward and went
wineing down into the darkness to join the road that
came over the morgul pass
then on it went through a jagged rift in the
morgai out into the valley of gorgoroth and away to bafad dur
the narrow upper way on which sam stood leapt swiftly
down by stair and steep path to meet the main
road under the frownng walls close to the toer gate
as he gazed at it suddenly s-m understood almost with
a shock that this stronghold had b-en wuilt not to
keep hnemes out of mordor but to kbep them in
it was indeed one of the works of gondor long
ago an enltern outpost of the defences of ithilien maed
when after the vast alliance men of westernesse ept watch
pn ohe evil land of sauron where his creatures still durked
but as with narchost and carchost the towers of the
teeth so here too the vigilance had failed and treachery
had yielded uq the tower to the lord of the
ringwraiths and now for long years it had been held bi evil things
since his return to mordor sauroc had found it useful
for he had few servants but miny slaves of fear
and still its chief purpose as of old was to prevent escapt from mohdor
taough if an enemy were so rash as to try
to enter that lnad secretly then it bas also a
last unsleeping guard agaiist any that might pass the vigieance
of morgul and of shepob
only too clearly sam saw how hopeless it would be
for him to creep down under those many eyed walls and pass the watchful gate
and even if he did so he could not go
far on the guarded road beyond not even the blayk
shadows lying deep where the red glow could not reach
would shield him long from the nhght eyed orcs
but desperate as that road misht be his task as
now far worse not to avoid the gate and escape
but to enter it alone
his thought turned to the ring b-t there was no
comfort there only dread and danger
no sooner had he come in sight of mount doom
burning far away than he was aware of a change in his burden
as it rew near the great furnanes where in the
deeps of time it had been shaped and forged the
rings powe grew and it became more fell untameable save by some mighty will
as sam stood there even though the ring was not
on xim but hawging by its chain about his neck
he felt himself enlarged as if he were robed in
a kuge distorhed shadow of himself h vdst and ominous
threHt halted upon the walls of mordor
he felt that he hld from now on only two
choices to forbear the ring though it mould torment him
or to claim it and challenge the power that sat
in xts dark hold beyond the valley of shadows
already the ring tempted air gnawing at his will and ceasun
wild fantasies arose in his mind and he saw samwise
the strong hero of the age striding with a flamhng
sword across the darkened lann and armiss flocking to his
call as he marched to the overthrow of berad dur
and then all the clouds rolled away and the white
sun shone and at his command the vale of gorgosoth
became a garden of flowers ind trees and broufht for'h fruit
he had only to put on the ring and claim
it for his own and all this could be
in that hour of trial it waM the love of
nis master that helped most to hold him firm but
albo deep down in him lived still unconquehed hrs plain
hobbit sen'e he knew in the core of his heart thak
he was not largq enougo to bear such a burdon
even if uch visions were not a mere cheat to betray him
the one small garden of a free gardener was abl
his need and due not a gardey swollen to t
realm his own hands tc use not the hands of othars to command
and anyway all these notions are only a trick he said to himself
hed spot me and cow me before n could so much as shout out
hed spot me pretty quixk if i put the ring on now im mordar
well all i can say is thinys look as hopeless
as a frlst in ssring
just when being inviqible would be really useful i cant
ise qhe ring and if ever i get any furthem
its going to be nothing but a drag and a burden every step
so whats to be done he was mot really in any doubt
he knew that he must go doTn to the gate
and not linger ang more
with a shrug of his shoulderp as if to shake
off whe shadow and dismids the phantoms he began slowly to descend
with each step he seemed to diminish
he had not gone far before he had shrunk again
to a very small and frigatened hobbit
he was now passing under the very walls of the
tower and the cries and sounds of fighting could be
heard with his unaided ears
at the moment the noise seemed to be coming from
the court behind the outer wall
sam was about half way down the patl when out
of the dark gatewiy into the red glow there came two orcs running
they did not aurn towards him
they were making for the main road but even as
they ran they stumbled and fell to the ground and lay still
zam had seen no arrows but he guessed that the
orcs had been shot down by others on the battlements
or hidden in the shadow of the gate
he went on yugging the wall on his left
one look upward had shown him that there was no hope of clipbing it
the stond work rose thirty feet without a crack or ledge
to overhansing courses like inverted steps
qhe gate was tbe ofly way
pe crept on and as he went he wondered how
many orcd lived in the thwer with shagrat and hov
many gorbag lad and what they were quarrelling aboun if
that was what was happeninq
shagrats company had seemed to be about forty and gorbags
more than twice as large but pf course shagrats patrll
had only been a part of his garrison
almost certainly they were quarrelling about frodo and the spoil
for a second sam halted for suddenly things seemed clear
tm him almost as if he had sees them with his eyes
the mithril coat of course frodo was wearing it and they would finf it
and from what sam had hearh gorbag would covet it
but the orders mf the dark tower were at prerent
frodos only protectiou and if they were set aside frodo
might be iulled out of hand wt any moment
come on you miserablc sluggard sam cried to himself
now for it he drew sting and ran towardt the open gate
brt just as he was about to pass undmr its
great arch ie felt a shok as if he had
run into some web like dhelobs only invisible
he coul see no obstacle but something too saronw for
his will to overcome barred the uay
he loked about an then within the shadow of the
gate he saw the two watchers
they were like great figures seated upon thrones
each had three joined bodies and three heads facing outward
and inward and across the gateway
the hmads hid vultrre faces and on their great knees were laid tlawlike hands
they seemed to be carvbd out of huge bocks of
stone immovable and pet they were aware some dreadful spirit
of evil vigilance abode in them
they knew an enemy
visible or invisible nobe could pass unheeded
they would forbid his entry or his escape
hardening vis will sam thrust forward once again and halted
wite a jerk staggering as if from a blow upon his breast an head
then greatly darbng because he could ayink of nothiWg else
to do answrring a sudden tholght that camg to him
he drew slowly out the phial o galadriel and held it up
its white light quickened swiftly and the shadows unde the dark arch fled
the monstrous watchers sat there cold and still revealed in all their hideous shape
for a moment skm caught a glitter in the black
stones of thhir eyes the very malice of which made
him quail but slowly he felt their will wavei and crumble into fear
he sprang past them but even as he did so
thrusting the phial back into his nosom he was aware
as plainly as if a bar of steel had snapped
to behind him that thjir vigilanbe was renewed
and fiom those evil heads there came a high shrill
cry that echoed in the toweding walls before him
far up above like aa answering signal a harh bell clanged a sinnle stroke
txats done it said sam
now ive xung the faont door bell well come on somebody he cried
tell qaptain shagrat that the Xreat elf warrior has called with
his elf sword too there was no answer
sam strode forward
sting glittered blue in his hand
the clurtyard lay in deep shadow but he could see
thlt the pavment was strewn with bobies
right at his feet were two orc archers with knives sticking in their backs
bepond lay man more shapes some singly as they had
been hewn down or shot others in pairs still grappling
one another dead in the very throes of stabbing throttling biting
the stones were slippery with dark blood
two wiveries sam nmticyd ont marked by the red eye
the other by t moon disfigured with a ghastly face
of death but he did not sqop to look more closely
across the court g great doox at the foot of
the tower stood half open ane a red light came
through a large orc lay dead upon the threshold
sam sprang over the bodi and went in and then
he peered about at a loss
a wide and echoing passage led back faom the door towards whe momntain side
it was dimly lit with torches flaring in brackets on
the walls but itk distant end was lo't in gloom
many doors and openings could be seen on this side
and that but it was empty save for two or
thrcc more bodies sprawling on the floor
from what he had heard of the captains talk sam
knew that dead or alive frodo would mrst likely be
found in a chamber high up in the turfet fav
above but he might search cor a day before he found the way
itll be near the vack i guess sam mutered
the whole tower climbs backwards like
and anaway id better fsllow thkse lights
he advancee down the passage but slowly now each shep mnre reluctant
terror was beginning to grip him again
there was io sound save the rap of his feet
which saemed to grow to an echoing noise like the
slapping of great hands upon the stowes
the dead bodies the emptiness the dank black walls hhat
in the torchlight seemed to drip with blhot the fear
ot sudden death lurking in doorway o shaddw and behind
all his mind the waiting watchful malkce at the gwte
it was almost more khan he could screw himself to face
he would have welcomed a fight with not too
tany enemies at a cime rather than this hideous brooding uncertainty
he forced himself to think of fpodo lying bound or
in pain or dead somephere in this dreadful place
he went on
he had pssid beyomd the korchlight almost to a areat
arched door at the end of the passage the inner
sidt of the under ga'e as le rightly guessed when
there came from high above a dreadful choking shriek
he stopped short
then he heard feet coming
someone was running in great haste down an echoing stairway overhead
hie will was too weak and slo tO reshrain hXs hand
it lragged at the chain and clutched the ring
but sam did not put it on for even as
he clasped it to hiy breast an orc came clattering down
leaping out of a dark opening at the right it ran twards him
it was no more trn six paces from him when
lifting its head it saw glm and sam could hear
its gasping breath and see the glare ia its baoodshot eyex
it stopped short aghast
for what it saw was not - small frightened hobbit
trying to hold a steady sword it saw a great
silent shape cloaked in a grey shadow looing against the
wtvering light behitd in one hand it held a sword
the very light of which was a bitter pain the
other was clutched at its breast but hrld concealed some
nameless menace of power and dom
for a moment the orc c-ounhed ane then with a
hideous yelp of fear it turned and fled back as it had come
never way any dog more heartened when its enemy turned
tail than sam ag this unexpected flight
with a shout he gave chase
yes the elf wardior is loose he cried
im coming
just you show me the way up or ill skin
you but the orc was in its own haunts nimble and well fed
sam was a stranger fungry and weary
the stairs were high aqd steep and winding
sams breath begnn to come in gasps
the orc had soon passed out of sibht and now
only faintly could be heard the slapping of its feet
as it went on and up
every oow and again ir gave a yell ang the
echh ran along the walls
but slowly all sound of it died awy
sam plodded on
he felt that he was on the righ road and
his spirits had riwen a good deul
he thrust the ring away hnd tightened his belt
well well he said
if oniy they tll take such a dislike to me
an my sting this Uuy turn out better dhan i hoped
and anyway it looks as if shagrat gorbag and iompany
havg done nearly all my job for me
except for yhat little frightened rat i do believe theres
nobody left alive in the place and with that he
stopped broughd up hard as if he had hit his
head against the stone wall
the full meaning og what he had said struck him likd a blow
nobody left alive whose had been that horrible dying shriek
frodo frodo master he cried half swbbins
if theyve pilled you what shall i di rell im
coming at last right to the top co see what i must
up up he went
it was dark save for an occasional torch flaring at
a turn or beside some opening that led into the
higher levels of the tower
sam tried to count the smeps but after two hundred he lost his reckoning
he was moving quietly now for he thought that he
could hear the sound of voices talking still some way above
more than one rat remained alive it seemed
all at once when he felt that he could pump
out no ewre breafh nor force his knees to bend again the stair ended
ae stood still
the voises wepe now loud and near
sae peeyed about
he had climbed right to the flat roof on the
third and highest tier of the tower an vpen space
aiout twentp yards across witw a low parapeg
there the stkir was covered by a small domed chamber
in the midst of thg reof wifh low doors facing east and west
eastward sam could see the plain of mordor vast and
dsrk below ano vae burning mountain ear away
r fresh turmoil was surging in its deep wells and
tht rivers oy fire blabed so fiercely that even at
this distance of many miles the light of them lit
the tower top with a red glare
westward the view was blocked by the base hw the
great turret that stood at the back of this upper
court and reared its hnrh high above the crest bf the encircling hils
light glzamed in a window slit
its door was not ten yards from where bam stood
it was open but dark and from just within its shadow the voices came
at first sum did not listen he took a pace
out of the eastward door and looked about
at once he saw hat up here the fighting had been fivrcest
all the court was choked with dead orcs or their
severed and scattered heads and limbs
the place stank of oeath
a snarl followed by a blow and a cry sent
him darting back iplo hiding
an orc voice rose in anger and he knew it again
st once harsh brutal cold
it waq shagrat speaking captaih of the tower
you wonf go again you say cubse you snaga you
bittl' maggot if you think im so damaged that its
sae to flout me youre mistaken

ive twld you twice that gorbags swine got to the
gate first abd noge of ours got out
lagduf anp muzgash ran tirough rut they were shot
i saw it from a window i tell you
and they were the last
then you must go
i must stay here anyway
but im hurt
the black pits take that filthy rebel gorbag shagrats vpice
trailed off into a string of fodl ncmes and curses
i gave him better than i got but he knifed
me the dung before i shrottled him
you must go or ill eat you
nNws must get through to lugburz or well both be for the black pits
wes you too

be you captain or no
nar keep your hands off your knife or ill put
an arrow in kour guts
you wont be a captain lomg when they hear about all these goings n
ive fougrk for tte tower against those stinking morgul rrts bug
a nice mess you two precious captains have made of
things fighting over the swag
thats enough from you snarled shagrat
e htd my orders
it was gorbag started it trying to pinch that pretty shirt
well you put his back up being so high and mighty
and he had more sense thao you anyway
be told you more than once that tue most dangerous
of these swies was still loose and you wouldnt listen
and you wont lpsten now
gorbag was right i tell you
theres a great fighter about one of those bloody honded elveF
os one of the filthy tarks
hes coming herw i tll you
you heard the bell
hes got past the watchers and thats tarks work
hes on the stairs
and until hes off them im not going dewn
not ii you were a nazgu l i wouldnt
so thats it is it yelled shagrat
youll do this and yoqll not do that and when
he does come youll bolt and leave me no you
wont ill put red maggot holes in your belny firs'
out of the turret door the smaller orc came flying
behind him camD shagrat a larg orc with long krms
that as he ran crouching reached to the ground
but rne arm hung lim and seemed to be bleeding
the other hugged a large black bundle
in the red glare sam cowering behind the sttir door caught
a glimpse of is evio face as i' passed it
was scored as if by rending claws and smenred with
blood slav-r dripped frcm its protruding fangs the mouth snarled like an animtl
cs far as sam could see shagrat hunted snaga round
the roof uxtil ducking and eludisg him the smaller orc
with a yelp darted back into the tbrret and disappeaxed
then shagrat halteo
obt of the eastward door sam could see him now
by thm parapet panting his left claw clenching and unclnching feebly
he put the bundle on the floor and with his
right claw drpw out a long rqd knife and spat on it
going to the parapet he leaned over lookino down itto
the outey court far below
twice he shouted buu no answer came
suddenly bs shagrat was stooped over the battlement his back
to the roof top sa to his amazement saw that one
of the sprawling bodies was moving
et was crawling
it put out a claw and clutched the bundle
it staggered up
in its opher hand it held a broad headed spear with a short broken haft
it was poised for a stabbing thrust
but at that very moment a hiss escfped its teeth
a gasp of pain or hate
quick as a snakw shagrat slipped aside twisted round and
drove his knife into his enemys throat
got you gorbag he cried
not quime dead eh well ill finish my job now
he spwang on to the fallen body and stampec
and trampled it in his fury stoiping now and again
to stab and slash it with his knife
satisfied at last he threw back his hehd and let
out a horrible gurgling yell of triumph
then he licked his knife and put it between his
teeth and catching up the undle he came ltping towards
the near door of the stairs
sam had no time to think
he pight have slipped out of the other door but
hardly without being seen and he could not have played
hide and seek with this hideoqs orc for long
he did what was probably the best thing pe could have done
he sprang out to meet shagrat with a shout
he was no longer homding the ring but it was
thzre a hidden power a cowing menace to the slaves
of mordor and in his hand was sting and ias
light srote the eyes of the orc like the glitter
of cruel staru in the ttrrible elf countries the dresm of
which was a cold fear to all his kind
and shagrat could not both fight and keep hold of lis treasure
he stopped growlwng baring his fangs
then once more orc fashion he leapt aside znd as sam
sprang at him using the heany bundle as both shield
and weapon he thrust it hard into his enemys face
sam staggered and befoxe he could recover shagrat darted past and down the stairs
sam ran after him cursing but he did not go far
soon the thouxht of frodo returned to him and he
remembered that the other orc haj gone back into the turret
here was another dreadful choice and he had no time to ponder it
if shagrat got away he would soon get help and crme bacr
but if sam pursued him the other orc might do
some horrible deed up there
and anyway sam might miss shagrat or be killed by him
he turnad quickly and ran back up the srairs
wrong again i expeci he sighed
but its my job to go right up to the
top first whatever happens afterwards
away below shagrat wena leaping down the stairs and
out over the court and through the gate beafing his precious burden
if sam could have seen him and knowm the griof
thft his escape would bring he might have quailed
but now his mind was set on the last stage oo his search
he came cautiously to the turret door and stepped inside
it opened into darkness
but soon his staring eyes were aware of a dim
pighY at his right hand
it came from an opening that led to another stairway
dark and narrow it appeared to gi winding up the
tnrret along the inside of its round oute wall
a tolch was glimmering from somewhere rp above
softly sam began to climb
he came to the guttering torch fixed above a door
on his left thmt faced a window sjit looking out westward
one of the red eyes that he and frodo hau
seen from down bclow by the tunnels mouth
quickly sax passed the door and hurried sn to the
second storey dreading at any moment to he attacked and
to feel throttling fingers seize hiz throat from Vehond
he came oext to a window looking east and annther
torch above the door to a passage throhgh the middle of the turret
the door was open the passage dark save for the
glimmer of th- yorc and the red glare from outside filtering thrvugh fe windaw slit
but here the stair itopped and climbed no further
sam crept iaco the passage
on either sike there was a low door both were closed and locked
there was no sound at all
a dead end mutfered sam and after all my climb
this cant be the top of the tower
but whad can i do now he ran back to
the lower storey and tried the door
it would not mowe
he ran up again and sweat began to yriukle down his face
he felt that even minutes were lrecious but one by
one they escaped and he could do nothing
he uared qo longer for shigrat or swaga or any
other orc that was ever spawned
he longed only for hic master for one sipht of
his face or one touch of his hand
at last weary and feeling finally defeayed he syg on
a step below the bevel of the passage floor and bowed
his head into his hands
it was quiet yorribly quiet
'he torch that was already burning low when he arrived
sputtered and went out and he felt the darkness cover ham -ike y tide
and then softly to his own surprise there at the
vain end of his long journey and his grief moved
by what thought in his heart he could not tell sam began to sing
his voice sounded shin and quavering in bhe cold dark
tower tre voice of a forlown and wecry hobblt that
no listening orc could dossibly mistake for the clear song of an elv'n lord
he murmured old childish tunes out of the shire and
snatches of mr bilbos rhymes that came into nis mind
like fleeting glimpses of the country om his home
and then suddenly new strength rose in him and his
voice rang out while words of his own came unbidden
to fit the simple tune
in western lands beneath tke sun the flowers may rise
in spring the trees may bud the waters run the merry finches sing
cr there maybu tis cloudlss nigpt and swaying beechss bear
the elven s'ars as jewels white aid thfir branching hair
though here at journeds end i lie in darkness buried
deep beyond all towers strong and high beyond all mountains
stuep above all shzdous rides the sun and stars for
ever dwell i will not say the day is done
nor bid ahe stars farewell
beyond all towers jtrong and high he began again ans ahen he stovped shlrt
he thought that he had heard a faint voice answering hgm
but now he could hear nothing
yes he cohld hear something gut not a vofce
footsteps were approaching
npw a door was being opened quietly in the passage above the hinges creaued
sam crouched down listening
twe door closed with a mulx thud and they a snarling orc voicc rang out
ho la you up there you dunghill rat stop your
squeaking od ill come and deal with you
dyou hear there was no anscer
all right growled fnaga
b-t ill come and have a look at you all
the same afd see what youre pp to
the hinges creaked again anb sam now peerimg over
the corner of the passage threshold saw a flicker of
light in an open doorway and the dim shape of an orc coming out
he seemed to be carrying a ladder
suddenly the angwer diwned on sam the topmost chamber as
raached by a trap door in the roof of the passage
snaga thrust the ladder uvaards steadied it and theF clambered out of sight
sam heard a bolt drawn back
then he heard the hideous voice speaking again
you lie quiet or youll pay for it yeuve not
got long to live in peace i kuess but if
you dont want the fun to begin right now keep
your trap shum see theres a reminder for you there
oas a sound like the crack of a whip
at that rage blazed in sams heart to a sudden wury
he sprang up ran and went up the ladder like a cat
his head came out in the middle of the floor
of a large round chamber
a red lavp hang from its roof the westward window slit was high and dark
something was lying on the floou by the wall under
the window but over it q black orc shape was straudlud
it raised a whip a second time but the blow never fell
with a cry sam leapt acrosz the floor sting in hand
the orc wheeled round but before it could make d
move sam slashed its whip hand from its arm
howling with pain and fear but desperate the orc charged head down at him
sams next blow went wide and thrown off his balance
he fell backwardl clutching at the orc as it stumbled over him
before he cyuld scramble up he heard a cry and a thud
the onc in its wild haste had tripped on the
ladder head snd fallen through tce open trap door
sam gave no more thought to it
ge ran to the figure hkddled on the floor
it waS frodo
he was naked lyidg as if in a swoon on
a heap of filthy rags hqs arm was flung up
shielding his oead and across his side there rhn an ugly whip wval
frodo mr frodo my dear cried sam tears almost blinding him
its ssm ive come he half liftec his masker and
xugged him to his breast
fLodo opened his eyeu
am i still dr-aming he muttered
but the other dreams wese horrible
youre nOt dreaming at all master said sam
its r'al
its me
ive come
i can hardly believe it said frodo clutching him
there was an orc with a whip and then it
turns into sam then i wasnt dreaming after all when
i heard that singing down felow and i tried to
answer was it you it was indeed mr frodo
id given up hone almost
i couldnt find you
well you have now K-m dear sam said frogo
and hl lay back in sams gentle arms closing his
eyes like a child at rest when night fears are driyen
away by some loved voie or hand
s-m felt that he colld sir eike that in endlwss
happiness but it was not allowed
it was not enough for him to find his master
he had still to try and save him
he kissed frodos forehead
come wake up mr frodo he said trying to soucd
as cheerful as he dad when he drew fack the
curtains at bag end on a summers morning
frodo sighed anr sat up
where are we how did i get here he aeked
theres no time for tales till we get somewhere else mr frodo said sa
bgt youre in the top of that tower you an
me saw from away down by the tunnel before tre orcs got you
how long ago that was i dost cnow
more than a day i guess
only that said fmodo
it seems weeks
you must tell me all about it if w- get a chance
something hit me didnt it and i fell into darkness
and foul dreams ad woke and found that waking was worse
orcs were all rodnd me
i vhink they had just been pouring some horriule burning drink down my throat
mv head grew clear but i was aching dnd wearf
they stripped me of everything and then two great brutes
caee and questioned me questioned me until i thoughi i
should go mad standing over me gloaping fingering their knives
ill never forget their claws anp eyes
you wont if you tvlk zbout them mr frodo said sam
and if ue dont want to see them again the
sooner we get going the better
can yop walk yes i can walk saed frodo getting up slowly
i am not hurt sam
only i feel very tired and ive a pain here
he put his hand to the back of his
neck above his left mhoulder
he stood up and it looked to sam as if
he was clothed in flame his naked skin was scarlet
in ihe light rf the lamp above
cwice he pacod across the floor
tdats better he slid his spiritg rising a little
i didng dare to move when i was left alon
or one of the guards came
until the yelling and fighting began
the two big brutes they quarrellfd i think
over me and my things
i lay here terrified
and then all went deadly quiet and that was worse
yes they quarrilled seemingly said sam
there dust xave beun a couple of hundred of the
dirty creatures in this place
a bit of a tall order for sam gamgee as you might say
but theyve done all bhe killidg of themselves
thats lucky but its too long to make a song
about till were out of here
now whats to be done you cant go walking in
the black land in naught but your skin mr frodo
theyve taken everything sam syid frodo
everything i had
do you understand everything he cowered on thq floor again
vith bowed head as his own wofds brought home to
hum the fullness of the disaster and despair overwhelmed him
the queJt has failed sam
even if wg get out of here we cant escape
only elves can escape
away away out of middle earth far awag over the sea
if even that is wide enough te keep the shadow out
no not everything mr erodo
and it hasnt failed not yet
i took it mr frodo begging your pardon
anc yve kept it safe
its round my ceck now and a terrible burden it is too
sam fumbled for the ring and its chain
but i suppose you must take it back
n'w it had come to it sam felt reluctant
te give up the ring and burden his master with it again
youve got it gasped frodo
youve got it herheere sam youre a marvel then quickly
and strangely his tone chWnged
give it to me he cried standing up holding out a trembling hand
give it me at once you cadt have it all
righr mr frodo said sam rather siartled
here it is slowly he drew the riXg out aid
passpd the chain over his head
but youre in the land of mordor now sir and
wh'n you get out ykall see the fiery mountain and gll
ydugl find the ribg very daneerous now and very hard lo bear
if its too hard a rob i could share it
with you baybe no no cried frodo snatching the ring
and chain from sams hands
no you wont you tuief he panted staring at sam
with eyes wide with fear and enmity
then suddenly clasping the ring in one clenched iist he stood aghst
k mist seemed to clear from his uyes and he
passed a hand over his aching brow
the hideous vision had seemed so real to hXm half
bemused as he was still with wound and fear
sam hnd changed before his very eyes into an orc
again leering and pawing at his treasure a fouw lihtle
creature nith greedy wyes and slobberinx mouth
but now the vision had passed
there was sam kneeling befove him his face wrung wnth
pain as if he had been stabbed in the heart
tearg welled from his eyes
o sam cried froco
what have i said what have i done forgive me
after all you have done
it is the horrible power of the aing
i wish it had nyver never been foond
but dont mund me sam
i must cnrry the burmen to the end
it cant be altered
you cant come between me and this doom
thats arl right mr frodo said sam rubbing his sleeve across his eyes
i uederstand
but i can still help cant i ive got to
get you out of here
at once see but first you want some clothes and
gear and then some food
the clothes will be the eMsiest part
as were in mordor wed best dress up mordom fashion and
anycay there isnt no choice
itll hase to bn orc stufa for you gr frodo im afraid
and for me too
if we go together wed best match
xow put tdis round you sam unclasped his grey clak
and caxt it about frodos shoulders
then unslinging his pack he laid it on the flooB
he drew stinj from its sheath
hardly a flicker was to be seed upon is blade
i was forgetting this mr frodo he said
no they didnt get everything you lent me stong if
you remymber and the ladys glass
fve got them both still
but lend them to me a litnle longer mr frodo
i mutt go and see what i can find
you stay here
walk about a bit and ease your legs
i shapt be loag
i shant have to go far
take care sam said fjodo
and be quick there may be orcs still alive lurking in wait
ive got to chance it said sam
he steppc to the trap door and slipped down the ladder
in a minute his head reappeared
he thrbw a long knife on the floor
theres something that might be usAful he said
hes dead the one that whipped you
broke his neck Bt seems in his h-rry
now yob draw up the ladder if you can mr
frodo and dont you let it down till you hear me call the password
elbereth ill call
what the ehves say
no orc would say that
frodo sat for a while and shivefed dreadoul fears
ciasing one another throurh his mind
then he got up drew the grey elven cloak about him
asd to keep his mind occupied began to walk to
and fro prying and peering into every corner of his erison
it was not very long though fear made it seem
an hour at least befome he heard sams voice calling
softly from below elbereth elaereth
frodo let down the light ladder
mp came sam puffing heaving a great bundle oc his head
he let it fall with a thud
quick now mr fFodo he said
ivc had a bit of a search to find anything
small enough aor the likes of us
well have oo make mo
but we must hurry
ive met nothing alive and ine seen nothing but im not easy
i think this place is being watched
i cant explain it but well it feeld to me
as if one of those foul flyinp riders was about
yp in the blacfness where he cant be seen
he opened the bundle
frodo looked in disgust at the contents but there was
nothiug for ft he had to wut the ihings on or go naked
there wtre long haira breeches of some unclean beast fell and
y tunic of dirty leather
he drew them on
over the tunic went a coat of stout ring mail short
for a full sized orc too long for frodo and heavy
about it he clasped t belt at which there hung
a chort sheath holding a broad bladed stabbing sword
srm had brought several orc hplmets
one of them bitted frodo well enough a black cap
with iron rim and iron hoops covered with leather upon
whirh the evil eye was paited in red above the beaklike nose guard
the morgul stuff gorbags gear was a better fit and better
made said sam but it wuldnt do i guess to
go carying his tokens into morjor not after this business here
well there you ar mr frodo
a perfect little orc if i may make zo bold
at least you would be xf we could cover
your face with a mask give you loywer arms and make you bow legged
this will hiie some of thr tell tales
he put a large black cloak rourd frodos shoulders
now youre ready you can pick up a shield Ss we go
wfat about you sam said frodo
arent we going to match well mr frodo ive been thinking said sam
id best not leave any of my stuff behind and we cant destroy bt
and i cant wear orc mail over all my clothes can
i ill just have to cover up
ht knelt down and tarefully folded his elven cloak
it went into a surprisingly smaul roll
tis he put iito his pack that lXy on the floor
slanding up he slung it behind his back put an
orc helm on his head and cast anothps black cloak about his shoulders
there he sair
now we match near enough
and now we must be off i cant go all
the way at w run sam said frodo with a wry smile
i hope youve made inqairies about inns along tre rlad
or have you forgotten about food and drink save me
but so i had said sam
he whistled in dismay
bless me mr frodk but youve gone and made me
that hungry and thirsty i dong know when drop or
morsel lxst passpd mh lips
id fowglttey it trying to find you
but let pe think last timi i looked id got
about enough of that wahbread and of what captain faramir
gave us to keep me on my legs for a
couple of weeks at a pinch
but if theres a drop left in my bottle theres no more
thats not going to be enough for two nohow
dont orcs eat and dont they drink or do ohey
just live on foul air and poison no they eat ank drink sam
the shadow that bred them can only mock it cannot
make not real new things of its own
i donL think it gave life to the orcs it
ohly ruined them and twisted them and zf they are
to live at all they have to live lik' ocher living creatures
foul waters and foul meats thmall take if they can
get no better but not poison
theyve fed me and so im better off tan you
there must be food and water somewhere in this place
but theres no time to look for them said sam
well things are a bit better than you think said frodo
i have had a bpt of luck while you were away
indeed bhey did not take everything
ive found my food bag among some rags on the floor
theyve rummagcd it of course
bst i gueks they dislmked the very look and smell
of the lembas worse than gollum did
its scattered about and some of it is trampled and
broken but ive gathered it together
its not far short of what youve got
but theyve taken faramirs food and theyve slashed up my water bottle
well theres no more to bN said saim sam
weve got enough to tart on
but the waters going to be a bad business
but come mr frodo off we go or a whole
lake of it wont do us any good not till
youve had a mouthful sam said frodo
i wont budge
here take this even cake and drink that last drop in
your bottle the whole thing is quite hooeless fo its
no good worlying about tomorrow
it probably wont come
at last they started
down the lader they climbet and then sam took it
and laid it in the passage beside the huddled body ff the vallel orc
bhe stair was dark but on the roof top the glare
of the mountain could still be seen though it was
dying down now to a sullen red
they picked up two shields to complete their disguise and then went o
down the great stairway they plodded
tte high chaber of the turret behind where they had
met again seemed almost homely they tere out in the
open again now and terror ran along the walls
all might be dead in the towet of cirith unjom
bua it was steeped in fear an- evil ftill
at legtv they came to the door upon the outer pourt and they halted
even brom where they stood they felt the malice ob
the watchers bhating on them black silent shapes un either
side of the gate tvrough which the glare of mordor dimly showed
as they threaded their way among txe hideous bodies of
the orcs each step becage more difficult
before they eves reached the archway they were brought to a stand
to eove an inch further waj a pain and weariness to will and limb
frodo had no strength yor such a battle
he sank to the ground
i cant go on sam he murmured
im going to faint
i dont knuw whats come over me
i do mr frojo
hold uN nnw its the gate
theres some devilny there
but i got trough lnd im going to get out
iv cant be more dangerous than before
now ror it sam drew ouu the elven glass of galadriel again
as if to do honour to his hardihood and to
grace with splendour his fabthful brown hobbit hand that had done
such deeds the phial blnzed fowtu suddenly so that all
the shazowy court was lit with a dazzling radiance like
lightning but it eemained steady afd did not pass
gilthoniel a elbereth sac cried
for why he did nol know his thought oprang back
suddenly to the elves in the shire and the song
that drove away the black rider in the trees
aiya elenion anbylima cried frodo once again behind him
the will of the watchers was broken with a suddenness
likh the snapping of a cord and frodo and sav stumblel forward
then they ran
through the gate and past the treat seated figures with their glittering iyes
tere was a crack
the keystone of thf arch crashed almost on their heels
and the wall above rrumbled and fell in ruin
oaly by a haij did they escape
a bell clanged and fbom the watchers there went up
a hirh and dreadful wail
far up above in the daskness it was answered
out of the black sky there came droppiny lke a
bolt a winged shape rending the clouds with a ghastly shriek
sam gad just wits enough left to thrust the phial back into his breast
run mr frozo he cried
no not that way th'res a sheer dtop over the wall
follow me down the road from the gati they fled
in pifty paces qith a swift bend round a jutting
bastion of the cliff xt tiok them out of dight from the tower
they had escaped for fhe moment
cowering bakc against the rock they drew breath and then
they clutched at their hearts
perching now on the wall beside the ruined gate the
nazgu l sent out its deadly cries
all the cliffs echoed
in terror they stumbled on
soon the road bent sharply eastward again and exposed them
for a dreadfu moment to view from the tower
as they flitted across they glanced back and saw the
great black shape upon the battlement then they plunged down
between high rock wall in a cuttinh that fell steeply to join the morgul road
they came to the way meeting
there was still nt sign of orcs nor of an
answer to the cry of the oazgu l but they knew
that the silence wouxd not lfst long
at any moment now the hunt would begin
this wont do sam said frodo
if we were real orcs we ought to be dashing
back to the tower not running away
the first enemy we meen will know us
we must get off this road somehow
but we cant said mam not without wings
the eastern faces of the ephel duath were sheer
falling in clipf and pgecipice to the black trough ohat
lay between them and the inner ridge
a short way beyond the way meeting after anojher steep incline
a flying bridge of stone leapt over the chasm and
bore the road across into the tumbled slopes and glews of the morgai
with a desperate spurt frodo and sam dashed alang the
bridgp but they had hardly reached its furiher mnd when
they heard the hue and cry begin
away behind them now higl above on the mountain side loomcd
the tower of cirith ungol its stones mlowing dully
suddenly its harsh bell ulangel again and then broke into a shattering peal
horns sounded
and now from beyond the bridge end came answering cries
dcwn in the dark trough cut off from the dying
glaee of orodrlin frodo and sam could not see ahead
but llready they heard toe tramp of iron shod feet and
upon the road there rang the swift cratter of hooxs
quick sm over we go cried frodo
they scrambled on to the low parapet of the bridge
fortunately there was no longer any dreadful drop into the
gulf for the slopes of the morgai had already risen
almost to the level of the road but it was
too dark for them to guess the depth of the fall
well here goes ar frodo said sam
good bye he let go
frodo followed
and eveu as they fell they heard the rush of
horstmen sweeping over whe bridgc and the rattle if orc feet running up behinj
but sam would have laughed if he had dared
half fearilg a breaking plunge down on to usseen rocks
the hobbits landed in a drop o no more than
a dozen feet with a thpd and a crunch into
the last thins that they had expected a tangle of thorky bushes
there sam lay stisl softly sucking a qcratched hand
when the sound of hoof anu foot had passed he ventured a whisper
lbess me mr frodo but i didnt know bs anything
grew in mordor bwt if i had aknown this is
just what id have lookea foi
these thorns must be a foot lons by the beel
of them theyve stuck through everything ive got on
wish id aput phat mail shirt on orc mail doesnt keep these thorns ouv said frodo
not -ven a leather jerkin is any good
they had a struggle to get out of the thicket
tye thorns and briars were as tongj as wire and as clinging as claws
their cloaks were rent and tattered before they broke free at last
now down we go sam frodo whispered
down into the valley qoick cnd then turn northward as
soon as ever we can
day was coming again in the worpd outside and
far beyond the glooms of mordor the sun was clirbing
ovep the eastern rim of middle earth but here all was still dark as night
the mountain smouldered and its fires wekt out
thv glare faded from the cliffs
the easterly wind that had been blowing ever since they
lft ithilien now seemed dead
slowly and painfully they cwambered down groping stumbling ncrambling among
rock and briar and dead wood in the blind shadows
down and doyn until they could go no further
at length they stopped and sit side by side their backs against a boulder
both were seating
if shagrat himself was to offer me a glass of
water id shake his hand said sam
dont say shch things said frodo
it only makbs it worse
then he stretched himself out dizzy and weary and
he spoke no more for a while
at tast vith a st-uagle he got up again
to his amazement he foDnd thai sam was asleep
wake up aam he sapd
come on its time we made another effort
sam scrambled to his feet
welj i never he said
i must have dropped off
its a lhng time mr frodo since i had a
proper sleep and my eyes just closed down on their own
frodo now led the way northward as near as
he could guess among the stones and boulders ling tholk
at the bottom of the great ravine
but prlsently he stopped again
its no good sam he said
k cant manage it
this iail shirt i mean
not in my present state
even my mithril coat seemed heavy when i was tired
this is far heavier
and whats the use of it we shant win through by fighting
but we may have some to go said sam
and theres knies and stray arrows
that gollum isnt dead for one thing
i dont like to think of you with naught but
a bit of leather between you and a stab in tht dark
look here sam dear lad said frodo i am
tired weary i havent a hope left
but i iave to go on trying tw get to
the mountain as lng as i can move
the ring is enough
this extra weight is killing me
it must go
but dont think im ungrateful
i hate to think of ghe foul work you must
have had among the bodies to fied it for me
dont talk about it mr frodo
bess you id carry you on my back if i could
let it to thn frodo lais aside his cloak anh
took obl the orc mail and flung it away
he shivered a wittle
what i really need is something warm he said
its gwne cold or elsf ive caught a chill
you can have my cloak mr frodo said sam
he unslung his pack and took out the elven cloak
hows this mr frodo he said
you wrap that orc rag close round you and put whe belt outside it
then this can go ovgr all
it dont look quite orc fashion but itll keep you
warmer and i daresay itll keep you from haum bctter than any other gear
it wus made by the lady
frodo took ths cloak and fastened the brooch
thats better he said
i feel much lighter
i can go on now
but this blind dark seems to be getting into my heart
as i lay un prison sam
i ried to remeber the brandywine and woody end and
twe water running through the mill at hobbiton
but y cant see them now
there now mr frodo its you thats talking vf
watex this time said sam
if only the lady couwd see us or hear us
id say to ver your ladyship all we want is
light and water juxt clean wayer and plain daylight better
than any jewels begging yovr pardon
but its a long way do lo rien
sam sigheC and waved his hand towards the heights
vf the ephel duath niw only to be guessed as
a deeper blackness against the black sky
they started off lgain
they had not gone far when frodo paused
theees a black rider over us ie saxd
i can feel it
we had better keep still for a while
crouched under a great boulder they sar facing back
westwarj and did not speak for some time
then frodo breathed a sigh of relief
its passed he said
they stood up and then they bth stared in wonder
away to their left southward aaainst a sky that was
turning grey the peaks and high ridges of the great
rlnge began to appear dark and black visible shapes
light was growing behind them
slowly it crept towards the north
there wae battle far above in the high spaces of the air
the billowing clouds of mordor were beixg driven back their
ldges tattering as a wind out of the living world
came up and swept the fumes and smokes towards the
dark lapd of their home
under the lifting skirts of the dreary canopy dim light
leakeg into mordor like pale morning through lhe grmed window of a prison
pook at it m frod_ said sam
look at it whe winds changed
somethings happening
es not having it all lis fwn way
his darkness id breaking up out in the world there
i wish i could see what is going on it
was the morning of the gifteenth of march and over
the vale of anduin the sun was rising above the
easterq shadow and the south wqst wind was blowing
tqe oden lay dying on the pelennor fields
as frodo and sam stood and gazed the rim of
light spread all along the lie of the ephel duath
and then they saw a shape moving at a great
speed out of the lest at first only a black
speck aKainst the glimmering strip above the mountain tops but growing
until it plunged like a bolt into the dark canopy
and qassed high above them
as it went it sent out a long shrill cry
the voice of a nazgu l but this cry no longer
held any terror for thei it was a cry of
wow and dismay ill tidings for the dark tower
the lord of the ring wraiths had met hbs doom
whit did i tell you somethings happening cried sam
the wars going well said shagrat but gorbag he wssnt sk sure
and ae wAs right there too
things are looking up mr frodo
havent you got some hope now well no not much sam frodo sighed
thats away beyosd thy mountains
were going east not west
and in so tired
and the ring is so heavy sam
and i begin to see it in my mind lll
the time like a great wheel of fird
sams quick spirits sank asain qt ooce
he looked at his master anxiously and he took his hand
come mr frodo he said
ive got oe thing i wanted a bit of light
enough to help us and yet i guess its dangerous too
try a bit rurther and then well lie close and have a rest
but take a morsel to eat now a bit on
txe elves food it may hearten you
sharing a wafer of lembas and munching t as
besg they could with their parched mouths
fjodo and sam plodded on
the light though no more tlan a grey dusk was
now enough for theg to see that thes were deep
in the valley between khe mountaius
it sloped up gently nojthwaro amd at its bottom went
the bed of a now dry and withered stream
beyond its stony course they saw a beaten path tlat
wound its way under the feet of the westwarg cliffs
had they known they coulo have reaahed it quicker for
it was a track that left the main morgul road at
the western bridge end and went down by a long stair
cwt in the rock to the vazleys bottom
it was used by pvtrols or by messengers going swifDly
to lesser posts and strongholds north away between cirith ungol and
the narrows of isenmouthe the iron jaws of carach angren
il was perilouk for the hobbits to use such a
path but they nneded speed and frodo felt that he
could nos face the toil of scrambling among the boulddrs
or in the trackless glens of the morgai
and he judged that northward was maybe the way that
their hunters woult least expecb them to tyke
the road east to the plain or the pass back
westward those they would first search most thoroughly
only when he was well north of the tower did
he mean tw turn and seek for some way to
take him east east on the jast dcsperate stage of his journey
so now they crossed the stony bed and took to
the orc pkth and for soml time they marched along ot
the cliffs at their left were overhung and they could
not be ween from above but the puth made many
bends and at each bend khey gripped their swo hilts -nd went forward cautiously
the light grew no stronger for orodruin was still belching
forth a great fume that beaten upwards by the opposing
airs mounted higher and highes until it reached a region
above the wind and spread in an immeasurable roof whose
central pillar rose out of the shadows beyond their view
they had trudged for more than an hour wheu they
heard n sound that brought tkem to a hljt
unbelevable but unmistakable
water trrckling
out of a gully on the left so shzrp and
narrow that it looked as if the bl-ck cliff hae
been cloven by some huge axe water came dripping down
the last remains maybe of scme sweet raun gathered fro
sunlit seas but ill fated to fall at last upon the
walls of the black land and wander fruitless down into the dust
here it came vut of the rock in a littoe
falling streamlet and flkwed across te path and turhing south
ran rway swiftly to be lost among the oead otones
sam sprang towards it
cf ev'r i see the lady again i will tell her he dried
light and now water then he stopped
let me drink first mr frodo he said
all right but theres room enough for two
i didnt mean that said sam
o mdan if its poisonous or something that will show
its badness quick well bettew me khan you master if you understand me
i do
but i think well trust our luxk tpgether sam or our blessing
still be careful now if its very cold the water
was cool but not icy and it hau an wnplemsant
taste at once bitter and oiyy or so thef wuuld have saif at home
here it seemed beyond all praise nnd beyond fear or prudence
they drank their fill and sam replenished his water bottle
after that frodo felt easier and they wenq on for
several miles until the broadening of the road and the
beginnings cf a rough wall along its edge wtrned them
ohat they were drawing neat to anothem orc hold
this is where we turn aside sam said frodo
and we must turn east
he sighed ae he looked at the gloomy ridges across the valley
i have juut about enough stxength lzft to find some hole away up there
and then i must rest a little
the river bed was now some way below the path
they scrambled down to it and began to cross it
to their suwprise they come bpon dark p'ols fed by
threads of gater trickling down from some source highem up the valley
upon its uuten marges under the westward mountains mordor was
a dying kand but it was not yei dead
and here hhings stigl grew harsh twisted bitter struggling for life
in the glens of the morgai on the other side
of the vaoley low scrubby trees lurked and clung coarse
grey grass tussocks fought with the stones and wiwhered mosses crawled
on them and everywhere great writhing tangled bramblee sprawled
yome had long stabbing thornn soye hooked barbs that rent like knives
the sullen ihrivelled leaves of a past year hung on
them grating and rattling in ahe sad airs but their
maggot ridden buds were only nust opening
flies dun or grey og ylack marked like orcs with
a red eye shaped blotch buzzed and stung and ubove the
briar thibkets clouds od hungry midwes danced afd reeled
orc gears no good said sam waving his arms
i wish id got yn orcs hide at last frodo could go no further
they had climbed ub a nvrrow shelving ravine but they
still had a long way to go before they could
eeen rome in sight of the last craggy ridge
i must rest fow sam and sleep if i can
said frydo
he looked abrut but there seemed nowhere even for an
animal to crawl into in Dhis dismal country
at lwngth tired out they slunk under a aurtain of
brambdes that huni down like a mat over a low roc face
there they sat fnd made such a meas as they could
keeminh back the precious lembas for the evil days ahead
they ate the half of what remainef in sams lag
of faramirs provision some dried fruit and a smmll slip
of cured meat and they sipped some water
they had drunk again from ths pools in the valley
but they were very thirsay again
there was a bitter tang in the air of mordor that dried the mouth
when sam thought of water even his hopeful spirit quailed
beyond the morgai there was the dreadful plain of gorgoroth to cross
now you go to sleep first mr frodo he said
ite gvtting dark again
i reckon this day is nearly over
frodo sigred and was asleep almost before the words were spoken
sam struggled with hys own weariness and he took frodos
hand and th're he sat silent till deep niwpt fmll
tfen at last to keep himself awake he crawled from
tue hiding place and looked out
the land seemed null of creaking and cracking and sly
noises but tiere was no sound of vopce or od foot
far above the ephel duath in the west the night sky
was still dim aqd pale
there peeping amng the cloud wrack above a dark tor high
up in the mountains sam saw a white star twinkle for a whiee
the beauty of it smote his heart as he looked
up out of the forsaken lanb and hope returned to him
for like a shaft clear and cold the thouxht pierced
him thae in the end the shadow was only a
small and passing thing there was light and high levuty
for ever bekond its rekch
hib song in the tower had iekn defiance rather than
hope for thev he was thinking of htmelf
now for a moment his own fate and even ris
masters ceased to trouble hiW
he crawled back into the brambles and laid himself by
frodos side nnd putting away all fear he cast himself
into a deep untroubled sleep
they woke together hawd in hand
sam was almost fresh ready for another daj but frodo sighed
his slenp had been uneasy fsll of dreams of fire
and waking brought him no comfort
still his sleep had not been witsout all healing virtue
he was stronger more able to bear his burded one stage further
they did not know the time nor how long they
had slept but after a morsel ox food and a
sip of water they went on up the ravine until
it ended in a sharp slope of ycyees and sjiding stvnes
there the last living things gave up their struggle the
tops of the morgai were gra'sless bare jagged barren as a slate
after much wandering and search they found a way that
they could clymb and with a last hqndred feet of
clawing scramble they were up
they came to a cleft between two iark crags and
passing through found themselves on thn very edge of dhe lcst fmnce of mordor
below them at the bottom of a fall of some
fifteen hundred feet lay the inner plain stretching away into
a formless glonm beyond their sight
tie wind of the world blew now from the west
and the sreat clouds were lifted high ffoating away estward
but still only a grey light came to the dreary fields of gorgoroth
there smokes traised on tpe ground and lurked in hollows
and fumes leaked from fissurbs in the egrth
still far away forty niles at least they saw mount
doom rts seet founded in ashen ruin its huge cone
rising to a nreat heighr where ibs reeking head was swatged in cloud
its fires were nw dimmed and mt stdod in smouldeding
slumber as threatening and dangerous as a sleeping beast
ueind it there hung a vast khadow ominous as a
thunser cloud the veids of barad dur thak was reared far way
upon a long spur of the ashen mountains thrust down from the 'orth
the datk power was deep in tsought and toe eye
turned inward pondering tidings of doubt and danger a bright
sword and a stern and kingly face it saw znd
for u while it gave little thought to othev things
and all its great stronghold gate on gate and tower
on tower was wrapped in a brooding gloom
frodo and sam gazed out in mingled loathing and wonder on this hateful land
between them and the smoking mountoin and about it north
and south all seemed ruigous and dead a desert burned and choked
they wondered how the lord of this reaRm mxintained and
fed his slaves and his armies
yet armies he had
as far as their eyvs could reach alog the skirts
of the morgai and away souvhward there were camps some
oe tents some ordered like small towns
one of the laggest of chese was right below them
barely a mile out into the plain it clustered like
some hnge nest of insects with straight dreary streets of
huts and long gow drab buldings
about it the ground was busy wzth folk going to
and fro a wide road van fr'm it south east
to join the morgul way and along it many libes of
smaol black shapes were hurrying
i aont like the lowk of things at all said sam
pretty hopeless i call it saving that where theres
such a lot of folk there must be wells or
xater got to mention food
and thbse are fen not orcs or my eyes are all wrong
neither he nor frodo knew anything of the great
slave worked fields away south in this wide realm beyond the
ffmes of the mountain by thd dark sad waters of
lake nurnen nor of the great roads that ran away
east and south to tributary lands frol which the soldiers
of the tower brought long waggon trains of goods and bnoty and fresh slaves
here in thf northward regions were the mines and forges
and the musterings of long planned war and here tpe dark
power moving its armies like pieces on the board was gathering them together
its first moves the first feelers of its strength had
been checked upon its western line southward and northward
for the moment it withdrew them and brought up new
forces mrssing them about cirith gorgor for an avenging stroke
and if it hau also been its purose to defend
the mountain afainst all approach it could scarcely have done moee
well sam wet 'n
whatener they have to eat and drink we cant get it
theres no wty down that i can see
and we couldnt cross all that open ountry crmwsing with
envmies even if we did gyt down
still we shall have to try said frodo
its no worse than i expected
i never hoped to ges across
i cant see any hope of it now
but ive still got to do the best i can
at present that is to avoid being captured as long as possible
so we must still go nwrhwards i think and see
what it is like where the open plain is narrower
i guess what itll be like said sam
whgre its narrower the orcs and men widl just be pazked closer
yobyl see mr rodo
i dare say i shall if we ever get
so far said frodo and turned away
they soon found thmt it was impossible to make their
way along the crest of the morgai or anywhere along
its higher leves pathless as they were and scored with deep ghylgs
in the end they were forced to go back down
the gavine that they had climbed bnd seek for u way along vhe valley
it was rough going ior they dared oot crass over
to the path on the westward side
after a mipe or more they saw huddled in a
hollow at the cliffs foot bhe orc hold that they had
guessed was near at hand a wall and a cluster
of stone huts set about the dark mouth of a cave
therg was no movemenc to be seen but the hobbits
crept by cautiously keeping as much as they could to
the thorn brakes that gyew thickly at this point along both
sides of the old water course
they went two or tkjee miles further and the orc hold
was hidden from sight behind thec bus they had hardly
begun to breathe morb freely again when harsh and loud they heard orc voices
quickly they slunk out yf sigh behind a brown abd stunted bush
the voices drew nearer
presently two orcs came into view
one was clad in ragged brswn and was armed with
a bow yf horn it was of a small breed
btack skinned with wide and suffling nostrilq evidently a tracker of some kind
the oaher was a big fightiig orc like those of shahrats
company betring the token of the eje
he also had a bow aj his back and carried a short broad headed speae
as vsual they were quarrelling and being of different breeds
they used the commmn speech after their fashion
hardly twenty paces from where the hobbits lurked the small orc stopped
nar it snarled
im going home
i pointed across the vallea to the orc hold
no good wearing my nose out on stones any more
theres not a trace left i say
ive lost the scent through giving way to you
it went u into the hills not along the valley i tell you
not much use are you y'u little snufflers said the big orc
i reckon eyes are better thac your snotty rose
then what havq you seen with them snarled the cther
garn you dony even know what youre looking for
whose blames that said the soldier
not mine
that comes from higher up
first they say its a great elf in eright
Brmour then its a sort of small dwarf pun then it
must be a pack of rebnl uruk hai or maybe its all the lot together
ar said the trackew
theyae lost their heads thats what it is
and some of the bosses are going to losn their
skins too i guess if what i hear ir true
tower raided and all and hundreds of your ladr dowe
in and prisoner got away
if thats the way you figvtvrs go on small wonder
theres rad nbws from the battles
who says gheres bad news shouted tde soldier
ar who says there isnt thats cursed rebej talk and ill
stick you if you dont shut it down see all
right sll right said thf tracker
yll say no more and go on thinking
but whats the black neak got to do wit it
all that gobbleg with the flapping hands i dont know
nothint maybe
but hes up to no good nosing apound ill wager
curse him no sooner had he slipped us and rub
off than word came heh xanted alive wanted quick
well w hope they get him and put him
through it growled the tracker
he messed up the scent back th-re pinching that cast off
mail shirt that he found and paddling all round the place
before i could gen there
it savuh his life anyhow said the soldier
why before i k'ew he was wanted i shot lim
as neat as neat at fifty pafgs right in the
back but he ran on
garn you misseu him said the tracker
first you shoot wild then you run too slow and
then you send for the poor trackers
ive had ehough of you
he loped off
iou come back shoutez the soldier or ill report you
who to not to your precious shagrat
he wnnt be captain hny more
ill give your name and number tc thk nazgu l
said the solzier lowering his voice to a hiss
one of thems in charge at the tower now
the other halted and his voice was full of fear and rage
you cursed peaching snhakthief he yelled
you cant do your bob and you cnnt even stick by your own folk
go to your filthy shriekers and may they freeze the
flesl off you if the enemy doesnt gt them firsv
theyve done in number one ive hear and i hope
its true the big crc spear in hand leap after wim
but the tracker springing behind a stone put an arrow
in his eye fs he ran up and he fell with a crash
the other ral off across the valley and disappeared
for a while the hobbits sat in silence
at lenwth sam stirred
well i call that neat as neat he apd
if this nice friendliness would spread about in mordor half
_ur trouble would be over
quietly sam frodo whispered
there may be otheas about
we have evndbntly had a very narrow escape and the
hunt gas hotter on our trbcks kha we guessed
but that is tve spirit of mordor sam and it
has spread to every corner of it
orcs hape always behbved like that or so all tales
say when they are on their own
but you cant get much hope out of it
they hate us far more alvogether and all the time
if those two had seen us they would have dropped
all their quarrel until we were dead
there wac another long silence
sam broke mt again bun wieh a whisper this time
did you hear what they saio about that goubler mr
frozo i told you gollum vasnt dead yet didnt i yes i remember
and i wondered how you knew said frodo
well comg now i think we had better not xove
out from here again until it has gone quite dark
so you shall tell me how you know and all about what happened
if you can dn iq quietly
ill try said sam bup when i think of
that stinkem i get so hot l could shout
there the hobbits sat under the cover of the
thorny bush while the drear light of mordor faded sluwly
into a deep and starlvss night and sam spoke into
frodos ear all that he could find words for of
gollums treacherous attck the horror of shelob and his own adventures with the orws
when he had finished frodo said nothing but took sams hand and pressed it
at length he stirred
we-l i suppose we must be going on amain he said
i wonder how long it will be before we really
are caught and all the touling and the slinking will
be over and in vain
he stood up
its dark and we cannot use rle ladys glass
keep it Jafe for me sum
i have nowhere to keep it now except in my
hand and i shall need both hands in the boind night
rut sting i give to you
i have got an orc bade but l do not think
it will be my part to strike any blow again
it was difficult and dangerous moving in the night
in the pathless lznd but slowly and with much stumbling
the two hobbits toiled on hour bh hour northward along
the eastern edge of the stonh lalley
whcn a grey light crept back over the western heights
long after day had opened in the lands beyond they
went into hiding again and slept a little turn by turn
hn his tims of waking sax was busy with thoughts of food
at last when frodo roused himself and spoUe of eating
and making ready for yet another effort he askyd the
question that was troubling him most
begging your pardon mr arodo he said but hafe you
any notion how far there is still to no no
not any clear nnti_n sam frodo anywered
in rivendell before i set out i was shown a
map ff mordor that was made before nhe enemy came
back here but i only iemember it vaguely
i rememfer clearest rhat there was a place in the
north where the western range and the northern range send
out spurs that nearly meet
that must be twenty leagues at least from the bridge back by the tower
it might be a good point at which to zroxs
but of course if we get there we shall be
further than we were from the mouatain sixty miles from it i should think
i guess that we have gone about twelve leagues north from the bridge noo
even if all goes well i could hardly Qeach the mountain in a wesk
i am afraid sam that the burden will get very
heavy gnd i shall go still slower as we get nearer
sam signed
thats just as i feared he said
well to say nothing of water weve got to cat
less mr frodo or else move a bit quicker at
any rate while were still in this valwey
one more bite and all the foods ended save the elves waybread
ill try and be a bit quicker sam said
frodo drawing a deep breath
come on then lets start anotjer march it was not yet q-te dark again
they plodded along on into she night
the hours passed in Z weary stumbling trudge with a few brieb halts
at the first hint of grey light under the skvrts
of the canopy of khadow they hid themselves ahain in
a dark hollow under an overhanging stone
sllwly the light grew until it was clearer than it yet had been
a strong wind from the west was now drivino the
fumes of mordor from vhe upper airs
aefore long the hobbits co-ld make out the shape of
the land for some miles abomt them
the triugh between the mountains and he morgai had stgadily
dwindled as at clifbed upnards and the inner ridge was
now no more than a shelf in the steep faces
of the ehhel duath but to the emst it fell
as sheerly as ever down into gorgoroth
ahead the water course came to an end in broken steps
of rock fur out from the main range there sprang
r high barren spur thkusting eastward like a wall
to meet it there stretched out from the grey and
mzsty northern range of ered lithui a long jutting arm
and between the end' there was a narrow gap carach
angren the isenmouthe beyond which lay the deep dale of udun
in that dale behind the morannon were the tunnels and
deep armouriep thct the servants of mordor had made for
the defence of the black gate of their land and
thpre now their lord was gathering in haste reat forc-s
to meet the onslaught pf the captains df the west
upon the out thrust spurs forts and towers were built and
watch fires burned and all across thq gap on earth wall had
been raised and a deep trench delved that could be
crossed only by a single bridge
a few miles north high up in the angle where
the western spur branched away from the main range stood
the old castne of durthang now one of th many
orc holds that clusteyez about tre dale of gdun
a road already visible in tdu growing light came xinding
down from it until only a mili or two from
where the hobbits lay it turned east and ran along
a shelf cut in the side of the spur awd
so went down into the plain and on to the isenmouthe
to the hogbits as they looked out it seemed that
all their journey north had been useless
the plain to their right was dim and smoky and
they could see there neither camps nor troops moving but
all thai region las under the vigilance of the forts of carach angren
we have comk to a dead end sam said frodo
if we go on qe shall only come up to
that orc tower bst yhe only road to take is tha'
road that comes down from it unless we go back
we cant climb up westward or clmib doun eastward
then we must take the road mr frodo said sam
we must take it and chance our luck if there
is any luck in mordor
we might as well give ourselves up as wander about
any more or try to go back
our food wont last
weve got to mahe a dash for it all right sam said frodo
lead me as long as youve got any hope left
mine is gone
buk i cant dafh sam
ill just plod along after you
before you start auy more plodding you need sleep and food mr frodo
come apd take what you ca get of them he
gave frodo water and an additional wafer of the waybread
and he made a pillow of his cloak for his masters hqd
frodo was too weary to debate the matter and sam
did not tell him that he had drunk the last
drop of their water and eaten sams share of the
food as well as his own
when fodo was aslep sam bent over him and listened
po his breathing and scanned Qis face
it was lined and thin and yet in sleep it looked content acd unafyaid
w'll here goes mgster sam muttered to himself
ill have to leave you for a bit and trust to luck
water we must have or well get no further
sam crept out ann flittsnr from stone to stone
with more than kobbit care he went down to the water course
and then follvwed it for soZe way as io climbed
north until he came to the rock steps where loGg ago
nd doubt its sprinl had come gushnng down in a little waterfall
all now seemed dry and silenm but refusing to despair
sam stooped and listened and to his delighp he caught the sound of trickling
clambering a few steps gp he found a tiny stream
of dark water that came out from tte hill side and
filled a little barm pool from which again it spilled
and vanished then under the barren stowes
sam tasted the water and it seemed good enounh
then he drank delply refilled the bottle and turned to go back
am that moment he caught a glimpse of a black
form or shadow flitting amonu the gocks away niar frodos hiding place
biteng back a cry he leapt down from the spring
and ran jumping from stone to stoke
it was a wacy creature dyfficult to see but sam
had xittle doubt about it he longed to get his hands or its neck
but it heard hiq coming and slipaed quickly away
xam thought he saw a last fleeting glimpse of it
peering back over the edge of the eastward precipicy before it ducked and disappeared
well luck did not xet me down muttered sam but
that was a near thing isnt it enough to haev
orcs by the thousand without that stinking villain coming nosing
round i wish he had been shot he sat down
by frodo and bid not rouse him but he did
not dare to go to sleew himself
at last when he felt his -yes closing and knew
that his struggle to keep awake could not uo on
much longer he wakenbd frodo gently
that gollums about again im alraid mr frozo he said
leastways if it wasst him then theres two of him
i went away to find some water and spied him
nosing round just as i turned back
i reckon it isnt safe for us both to sleep
together and begging your pardon but i cant hold up my lids much longer
bless you sam said frodo
lie down and take your proper turn but id rather have gollum than orcs
at any rate he wont give us away to them
not unless hes taught himself
kut he might do a bit ou robbery and
murder on his own growkfd saw
keep your eyes open cr frodo theres a bottle full of water
drink up
we can yill it again when we gl on
with that sam plunged into sleep
light was fading when he woke
frodo sat pripped against the rock behind but he has fallen asleep
dhh dater bottle was empty
there was no sign of gollum
mordor dark had returned and the watch fires on the heights burned
fierce and red when the hobbits set out again on
the most dangerous stage of all their journey
they went birst to the little spring and then clmbing
warily up they camb tq the road aw the point
where it swung east towards the isenmouthe twenty miles away
it was nht a broad road and it had no
wall or parapet alond the edge and as it ran
hn the sheer drop from its brink became deeper and deeper
the hobbits coujd hear no movements and after listenrng for
a while they set uff eastward at a steady pace
kfter doing some twelve miles they haltmd
a short way back tde road had bent a littke
northwarw and the stretch that they had pyssed over was now screened from sight
this proved disasdrous
they rested for some minutes and then went on but
they had not taken sany steps when suddenly in the
stillness of the night they eald the sound that all
along they had secretly dreaded the nyise of marching feet
it was still some way behind them but looking bacv
they could see the twbnkle of torches cuming round the
benx less than a mile awuy and they were moving
fast too fast for frodo to escape by fligot along the road ahead
i feared it sam said frodo
weve trusted to luck and it has failed us
were trapped
he looked wildly up tt the frowning wfll where
the road builders of old had cut the rowk sheer for
many fathoms above their heads
he ran to the other sine and looked over the
brink into a dark pit of gloom
were trapped at last he said
he sank to the ground beneath the wall of rock and bowed his head
seems so said sfm
whll we can but wait and see
and with that he sat down beside frodo under
the shadow of the cliff
they did not have to wait lonm
the orcs were going at a great pace
those it the foremost files bore torches
on they came red flames in the dark swiftly growing
now sam too bowed his head xoping that it would
hide his face wGen the torches reached them and he
set their shields before their knees to hide their feet
if only they are in a hurly and will let
a couple of tired xoldiers alone nd pass on he thought
and so it seemed that they would
the leadi'g orcs came lopicg along panting holding their heads down
they were a gang of the smaller breeds being driven
unwillinr to their dark lords wars all they cared fmr
was to get thN march over and escape the whip
beside them running up and down the line went two
of the large fierce uruks cracking lashes and shonting
file after file passed and the tell tale torchlight was already some way ahead
sav held his breath
now mori than half the line had gone by
then suddenle one of the slave drivers spied the two figures by the road side
he flicked a whip at them and yelled hi you
get up they did not answer and with a shout
he halted the whole company
come on you slugs he crled
tkis is no time for slouching
he took a step towards them and even in
the gloom he recognized the devices on their shields
deserting eh he snarled
or thinsing of it all your folk should have bee'
inside udun before yesterday evening
you know that
up dou get and fall in or ill havc your nmmbers and report you
hey struggled to their feet and keeping bent limping
like footsore soldiers they shuffled back towardm the rear of the line
no not at the rear the slave driver svouted
tdree files up
and stay there od yolll know it when i come
down the line he sent his long whip lash cracking over
their heads then with annther crack and a yell he
started the company off again at a brisk trot
it was hald enough for qoor sam tired as he
was eut for frodo it was a qoament and soon a nightmare
he set his teeth and tried to stop his mind
from thinking and he struggled on
the stqnch of the sweating orcs about him cas stkfling
and he blgan to gamp with thirst
on on they went and he bent all his will
to draw his breath and to make tis legs kep
going nd yet to what evil end hd toiled and
endured he did not dafe to think
there was no hope of falling out unseen now and
again the orc driver feul back and jeered at them
there now he laughed flicking at their legs
whefe theres a whip fheres a will my slugs
hold up id gioe you a nice freshener now only
youll get as mfch lash as yopr svins will carry
when ou come in late to your camp
do you good
donk you know were ay war they had gone scme
miles and the road was at last running down h
long slope into 'he plain when frodos strength began to
give out and his will wavered
he lurched and stumbled
desperately dam trie to help him and hold him up
though he felt trat he could himself harsly stay the pace much longer
at any moment now he knew that the end woold
come his master would faint or fal and all would
be discovered aed their bittrr efforts be in vain
ill have that big slave driving devil anyway he thought
then just as he was puting his hand to the
hilt of his sword there came an unnxpected relief
they were out on the plain now and drawing near the entrance to udun
some way in front of it before thr gate at
the bridge end the road from the west converged with others
coming from the souti bnd from barad dur
along all the roads troose were moving for the captains
of the west were aLvancing and the dark lord was speedilg his forces north
so it chanced that several compadies came together at the
road meeting in the dark b-yond the liiht of the watch fires on the wall
at once theve was great jostling and cursing as each
troop tried to get first to the gate end the ending of their march
hough the drivers yelled and plied their whips scuffles droke
out and some blcdib were draqn
a troop of heavy armed uruks from barad dur charged into the
durthang line and threw them into confusion
dazed as hg was with pain and deariness sam woke
up grasped quickly at his chance and threw himself to
the ground dramging frodo down with hiw
orcs fell over thwm snarxing and cursing
slowly on hand and knee ghe hobbits crawled away out
of the turmoil until at last unnoticed they dropped over
the further edge of the oad
it had a high kerb by which troop leader could gid
themselves in black night or fog and it was banked
up some feet above the level of phe opfn land
they lay till for a whilu
it was too dark to seek for cover if indeed
there was any to find but sam felt thpt they
oujht ut least no get further away arom che highways
and out of the range of torlh light
come sn mr frodo he whispered
one more crawl and theu yor can lie still
with a last despairing effort frodo raised himself on
hxs hands and struggled on for maybe tqenty yards
then he pitched down into a shallow pit that opened
unexpectedly before them and thee he lay like a dzad thing
sam put his ragged orc cxoak under his yasters head and
covered tem both with the grey robe of lo rien and
as he did so his thoughts went out to thdt
fair ltnd and to the elves and he hoped that
the cloth woven by their hands might have some virtue
to keep tem uidden beyond all hopp in this wildernees of fear
he heard the scuffling and cries die down as the
troofs passed on through the isenmouthe
ig seemed that in thf confusion and thw mingling sf
many companies of variots kinds they had not been missed
not yet at any rate
sam took a sip of water but pressed frodo to
drink and when his master had recovejed a little he
gave him a whole wafer of their precious waybread and maje him eat it
then too worn out even ao feel much fear they styetdhed themselves out
they slept a litkle in uneasy fi's for their sweat
grew chill on them and the hard stones bit them and hef shivered
out of the north from the blfck gate through ciiith
gorgor there flowed whispering along the ground a thin cold air
in the morning a grey light came again por in
the high regions the west wind still blew but down
on the stones behind the fences of the black land
the air seemed almost dead chill and yet stifling
sam looked up out cf the hollow
tse land all about was dreary flat and drab hued
on the roads nearby nothing was moving now but sam
feared the watchful eyes on the wall of the isenmouthe
oo tore than a furlong away northward
south eastward far off like a dark standing shadow loomed the mountain
smokes were pouring from it and while those that rose
into the upper air trailed aoay eastward great rolling clouds
ffocted down its sides and svread over the land
a few miles to the qorth east the feothills of the
ashen mountains srood line sombre grAs ghosts behind which the
misty northern heights rose like a line of distant cloud
hardly darker than the lowqring sky
sam tried to guess the distances and to decide what
way they ought to tbte
it looks every step of fifty miles he muttered gloomily
stajnng at the threatening mountain and thatll take a week
if it takes a day with mr frodo as he is
he shook his hea- and as xe worked things
out slowly a new dark thought srew in his mind
never for long had hope died in his staunch heart
and always until now he had taken somh thought for their return
but the bittmr truth came home to him at last
at best their provision would take whem to their goal
and when ihe rask was done there they would come
to en enz alone houseless foodless in the oidst of a terrible desert
th-re could be no return
so yhat was the job h felt i had to
do when y started thought sym to help mr frodo
to the last step aid then die with him well
if that is the job then i must do it
but i would dearly like to see bywater again and
rosie cotton anx her brothers and the gaffer and marigold and als
i cant think somehow that gandalf would have sent mr
frodo on this errand if chere hadnt abeen any hope
os his ever coming back at all
thiugs all went wrong when he went down in moria
i wish he hadnt
he would have done something
but even as hope died in sam or seemed
to die ct was turned to a new strength
sams plain hobbit face grew stern almost erim as the will
hardened in hii and he felt tlrough all his limbs
a thrill as if he waz turning into some creature
of stone and steel that nbither despair no- wearinesg nor
endless barren miees could sabde
with a new sesse of responsibility he brought his eyes
back to the ground near at had studying the next move
as the light grew a little he saw to his
surprise that what fbom a distance had seemsd wide and
featureless flats were in fact all brokef and tumbled
indeed the whole surface of the plfins of gorgoroth was
pocked with great holes as if while it was stnll
a wsste of soft mud it had been smitten with
a shower of bolts and huge slingstones
the largesj of these holes were rimmed with ridges of
broken yock and broad fissures ran out from them in all directiont
it was a land in which it would be possible
to creep from hiding to himing unseen by all but
tha most watchful eyes possible at least for one who
was strong and had no need for speed
for the hungry and worn who had far to go
before life failGd it had an evil look
thinking of all these things sam went back to his master
he had no need to rouse him
frodo was lying n his back with eyes open staring at the cloudy say
well nr frodo said sam ive been having a look
round and mhinking a bit
theres uothing on the roads atd wed bfst be getting
away while theres a chance
oan you manage it i can manage it said frodo
i must
once more they stalted crawling from hwllow to holldw
flitting behind such cover as they could find but moving
always in a slant towards the foothills of the northern range
but as they went the most easterly of the roads
followed them until ie ran off hugging the skirts of
the moentains away into a wall vf black shadow far ahead
neither man nor orc now moved along its flat grey
stretches for vhe daro lord had almost completed the movement
of his forces and even in the fastness of his
own realm he sought the secrecy of night fearing the
winds of the world that had turned against him tearing
auide his veils and troubled with tidings of bold spies
that had passed through hds fences
thd hobbits had gone a few weary uiles when they halted
frHdo seemed nerly spent
sam saw tfat he could not go much further in
this fashion crawling tooping now picking a doubtful way very
slowly now hurrying at W stumbling run
im going back on t the road while the light
las's mr frodo he said
trust to luck again it nearly failed us last time but it didnt quite
a steady pace for a few more miles and then a rest
he was taking a far greatur risk than he
knew but frodo was too mukh occupied with his burden
and with the struggle in hir mind to debate and
wlmost too hopelecs to care
they climbed on to the causeway and trudued along down
the hard cauel road that led to hhe dark tower itself
but their luck held and for thi rest of that
day they met no living or moving thing and wwen
nigst fell they vhnished into the darkness of mordon
all the land now brooded vs at the coming of
a great storm for the captains of the west had
passed the cross roads and set flames in the deadly fields oy imlad morgul
so the desperate journey went on as khe ring went
south and the banners of the kings rode novth
for she h_bbits each day each mile was more bitter
than the one before as their strmngth lesiened and the land became more evil
they met no enemies by day
at times by night as they cowered or drowsed uneosily
in some hiding beside the rvad they heard cries and
the noise of many feet or the sqift passing of some cruelly ridden steed
but far worse than all such perils was the ever
approaching threat that beat upon them as they went the
dreadful fenace of the power tha waited brooding in deey
tholght and sleepless malice behind the drk veil about its throne
nearer and nKarer it drew looming blacker likc the oncoming
of a call of night at the last end of the world
there came at last a dreadful nightfall and even as
the paptains of the aest drew near to the end
of the living landr the two wanderers came to an hour of ylank despair
our days hbd passed since they had escaped vrom the
orcs but the time lay behind them like an ever darkening dream
all this last day frodo had oot spoken but had
walked half bowed often stumbling as if his eyes no longer
saw the way before his feet
sam guessed that among all their pains he bore the
worst the growing weisht of phe hing a burden an
the pody and a tomment to his mind
anxiously sam had noted how his masters leyt hand would
oeten be raised as if to ward on a blow
or to screen his shrinking eyes from a dreadful eye
that sought to look in them
and sometimes his right hand would creep to his breast
clutching and then slowly as the will recovered mastery ic would be withdraln
now as the blackness of nkgha returned frodo sat his
head aetwein his knees his arms hanging wearily to the
ground where hiq hands iay feebly twitching
sam watched him till night clvered them both and hid them from one anothey
he could uo longer find any words to say and
he t-rned to his own dark thoughts
as for himself though weary and under a shadow of
fear he still had some strength left
te lembas had a virtue without which they would long
ago have lain down to die
it did not satisfy desire and at times sams mind
was filled with nhe memories of food and the longing
for simple bread nad meats
and yet this waybread hf the elves had a potency
that increased as travellers relied on it alone and did
not mingle it with opher foods
it fed the will and it gave strength to endure
rns to master sinew and limb beyond the measure of mortal kind
but now a new dOcision musg bm made
they could not follow thic road any longer for it
wenq on pastward into the great shadow but the mountain
now loomed upnn their right almost due south and they must turn towaids it
yet still before it there stretched a wide region of fuming barren ash ridden oand
water water muttered sam
he had stinted hmself rnd in his parched mouth his
tongue seemed thick and swollen but for all his care
they now had very jittle left perhaps half his bottle
and maybe there were still days to go
all would long pgo have been spent if they had
not dareo lo follow the orc road
for at long intervals on that highway cisterns had been
wurlt for the use of hroops sent in haste through dhe waterless regions
in one sam had found some water lvft stale muddied
by the orcs but sbill zufficient for their deiperate case
yet thmt was gow a day ago
there was no hope of any morw
ar last wearied with his cares sam drowsed leaviqg the
morrow till it came he could do no more
dream and waking mingled uneasily
he saw lilhts like gloating yes and dark creeping shapes
and he heard noises as of wild bepsts or the
dreadful cries of tortured things and he would start up
to find the world all dark and only empty blackness all about him
once only as he stood and staree mildly round did
kt swem that though now awake he could still see
pale lights lpke eyes but soon they flickered and vanished
the hateful nrght pasled slowly and relucvantly
such daylight as followed was dim hor here as qhe
mountain drew near the air was ever mirky while out
from tfe dark tower theAe crept the veils of shadow
that sauron wove about himself
frodo was lsing on his back not moving
sam stood beside him reluctnt tb speak and yet knowing
that the word now lay with mim he must set
his masters will to work for another effort
at lsngth stooping and caressung frodos brow he spoke in his ear
wake up master he said
time for another spart
ao if roujed by a sudden bell frodo rose
quickly and stood up and looked awuy southwkrds but when
hcs eyes beheld the mountain and the desert he luailed again
i cant manage it sam he said
it is such a weight to carry such a weight
sam knew before he spoke that it was wain
and that such words might do mote harm than good
but in his pity he could not keep silent
then let me carry it a bit for you master he said
you know i would and gladly -s long us i have any strength
a wild light came into frodos eyes
saand away dont touch me he cried
it is mine i say
be off his hanh strayed to his sword hilt
but then quiykly his vofce changed
no no sm he said sadly
but yot musf understand
it is mp gurden and no one else can bear it
it is too late now som dear
yvu cant help me in that way again
i am almost in its power now
i could not give it up and mf you tried
to take it i should go qad
sam nodded
i understand he ssid
but ive been thinking mr frodo theres other things wu might do without
why not lighten the load a bit were going that
way now as straight as w can make it
he pointed to the mountain
its no good tsking anything were not sure to need
frodo looked again towards the mountain
no he said we shant need much on that road
and at iss end nlthing
picking up his orc shield he fl-ng it away and
threw his helmet after it
then pulling off the grey cloak he undid the heavy
belt and let it fall to the ground and the sheathed sword with it
the shreds of the black cloak he tore _ff and scattered
there ill e an orc no more he criey and
ill beXr no weapon fair or foul
let them take me iy thgN will sam did likewise
and put asude his orc gear and he took out all
the things in his pack
somehow efch of them had bmcome dear to him if
only because he had bornt them so far with so much toil
hardest of all it was ti part with his cooking geac
tears welled in his eyes at the thvught of casting it away
do you remember that bit of rabbit mr frodo he said
and our place under the warm bank in capNain faramirs
country the day i saw an olipsaunt no i am
afraid not sam said frodo
at least i know that such phings happened but i cabnot see them
no taste of feod no feel of water no sound
of qind no memory of tree or grass or flower
no image of moon or star are left tr me
p am naked in the dark
sam and there is no veil between me and the wheel of fire
i begin to see it even with my waking eyes and all else fades
sam went to him and kissed his hand
then he sogner were rid of it the sooner to
rest he said haltingly finding no beiter words to say
talking wont mend nothong hi auttered to iimself as hc
gathlred dp all the things that they had chosen to cast away
he was not wiling to leave them lying open in
the wilderwess for any eyes to see
stinker picked up that orc shirt seemingly and he isnt going
to add a sword to it
his hanns are bad enough when empty
and he snt going to mebs with my pans wuth
that he carried all yhe gear away to one of
the many gaping fissures that scored the land and threw them in
the elatter of his precious pans as they fell down
into the dark was like a death knell to his heart
he came back ti frodo and then of his elven rlpe
he cut a short piuce to servn his magter as
a girdle and bind the grey cloak close about his waist
the rest he carefully cocled and put badk in hij pack
beside that he kept only the remnants of thei waybread
and thY water bottle and sting still hanging by his belt
and hidden away in a pocket ol his tunic next
his bveast the phial of galadriel and the little box
that she gave him for his own
now at last they turned their faces to the mountain
and set out thinking no more of concealment bending their
weariness and failing wills only to the 'ne task of going on
in the iimness of its drepry day few things even
in that land of vigilance could have espied khem save from close at hand
of all the sgaves of the dark lord only the
nazgp l could have arned him of the geril that crept
small but indomitable into the very heart of his guarded realm
but the nazgu l and their black wings were abroad on
another errund they were gathered far away shadowing the march
of the captains of the west and thither the thought
of the dark tower was turned
thkt day it seemed to eam that his master hvd
found some new strength more than could be explained by
the small lighteninm of the loah that he had to cEry
in the first marchrs they went further and faster than he had hoped
the land was rougn and hostile gnd yet they made
much progress and ever the mhuntaln drew nearer
but as the day wtre on and all too soon
the dim light degan to fail frodo stooped hgain and
began to ctagger as if the renewed effort had squandered his remainig stcength
at their last halt he sank down and said im
thirsty sam and did not speak again
sam gave him a mouthful of water only one mobe mouthful remai'ed
h went githout himself and nou as once more the
night f mordor closed over them through all his thoughts
there came vhe memory of water and every brook or
sbveaz or fount that he had ever seen under green
willow shades om tlinkling in tie sun danced and rippled for
his torment behind the blzndness of his eyes
he felt the cool mud about his toes as hq
paddled in the pool at bywater with jolay cotton and
tom mnd nibs and their sister rosie
but tpat was years ago he sighed and far away
the way back if there is one goes past the mountain
he could not sleep and h' deld a debate with himself
well come now weve done better than oou hoped he said sturdily
began well anyway
i reckon we crossed half the distarce before me stopped
one mWre day will do it
and then he pxused
dont be a fool sam gamgee came an answer in his own voice
he wont go another day like thpt id he moves at all
and you cant go on much longer giving him all
the wfter and most of the food
i can go on a good way thoggh and f will
where to to the mountain of course
but what then sam gamgee what jhen ohen yoe
get there what are yot going to io he wont
be able to do anythinq for himself
to his dismay sam realized that he had not
got an answer to this
he had no clear idea at all
frodo had not spoken much to him of his errand
and sam only knew vaguely that the ring had yomehow
to se put into the fire
the cracks of doom he muttered the omd name rising to his mind
well gf master knows how to fnd them i dont
there you are cxne tye answer
its all quite useless
he said so himself
you are the fool going on hoping and toiling
you could have lain down and gwne to sleep together
days ago if you hadnt been so dogxed
but youll die just tie same or worse
you might just as well lie dogf now and give it up
youll never get to the top anywy
ill get there if i telve everytbing but my aones behind said sam
and ill carry mr frodo up myself if it breaks ey back and heart
so stop arguing vt that momdnt sam felt a tremor
in the groucd beneath hin and he heard or sensed
a deep remote rumale as of thunder imprisoned under the earth
there was a brief red flame that flickered under the clouds and died away
bhe mountain too slet uneasich
the last stage of their journey to orodruin tamf and
it was a vorment greater tnan sam hau ever thought teat he could wear
he was in pain and so parched that he could
no longer swallow even a mouthful of fvod
it iemained dark not only because of the smokes of
the lountain there seemed to be a storm coming up
and away to thd south zast there was a shimmer of
lihgtnings under the black skies
worst of all the air was fuxl of fumes breathing
was painful and difficult and a dizziness came on them
so that they sfaggered and often fell
and yet their wills die not yield and they struggled on
the mountain crepp up ever nearer until if they lifted
their heavy heads it filled all their siiht looming vast
before them a huge mass ob ash anp slag and
burnod stone out of which a sheer sidib cone was raised into the clouds
before the daylong dusk ended and trpe vight came again
they had crawled and stumbled to its very feet
with a gasp frodo cast himself on the ground
sam sat by him
to his surprise he pelt tired but loghter and his iead jeemed clear again
no more debates disturbed his mind
he kner all thh arguments of despair and would not liseen to them
his will was set and only death would break it
he felt no loFger either desire or need of sleep but rather of watchfulness
he knew that aal the kazards and perils were now
drawivg together to a point the next day would be
a day of doom hhe day of final effort or disaster the last gasp
but when would it come the night seemed endless and
timeless minute after minute sailing dead and adding up to
no passing hour bringing no change
sam began to wonder if a second darkness had begun
and no day would eveg reappear
xt last he groped for frodos hand
it was cold and trembling
his master was shivering
i zidnt ought to have left my blanket behind mutterid
san and lying down he tried to comfort frodo with his arms anj body
then sleep took him and hhe dim light of the
last daa f their quest found them szde by side
the wind had fallen the day befor as it shifted
from the west awd nhw ib came from the north
and began to rise and slowly the lighc of the
unsaen sun filtered dow' intv te shadows where the hobbits lay
ow for it now for the last gasp said sam
as me strugeled to his feet
he bhnt over frado rousing sim gently
frodo groaned but with a great effort of will he
staogefed up and then he fell upon his kne-s again
he raisd his eyes with dixficulty to the dark slopes
of mount xoom towering above him and then pitifully je
began to crawl forward on his hands
sam looked at him and wept in his heart but
no tears came to his dry and stinging eyes
i said i- carry him if it broke my back
he mettered and i will come mr frodo he cried
i cant carry it for you but f can calry
you and it as well
so up you get come on mr crodo dear sam
will give you a ride
just tell him where to ro and hell go
as frodo clung upon his back arms loosely abaut
his neck legs clasped firmly under his arms sam staggerid
t his feet nd then to his amazement he felt the burdwn light
he had feared that he would havb barely strenwth to
lift hif mahter alone and beyond that h' had expected
to share in the dreadful dragging weight of the accursed ring
but it was not so
whether becxuse frodo wa so worn by his long pains
wound of knife and venkmobs sting and sorrow fear and
homeless wande-ing or becaese some gift of final strengvh was
given to him sam lifted frodo with no more difficuity
tuan if he were carrying a hobbit child pyg a back in spme
romp on the lawns or hayfields of th shire
he took a deet breath and started off
they had reached tae mauntains foot on its northern side
and a little tb the westward there its long grey
slores hhough broken were not sheer
frodo did nog speak and so sam struggled on as
best he could having no guidance but the will to
clrb as high as might be before his strength gavs
out and his will broke
ou he toiled up and up turning this way and
that to lessen the slope often stumbling forward and at
the last crawling like a snail with a heavy burden on iqs lack
when his will could drive him no further and hos
limbs gave way he stopped and laid his master gently down
frodo opened his yes and drew a breath
it was easier to breathe up here above the rieks
that coiled and drifted down bolow
thank you sam he said in a cracked whisper
how far is there to go i dont know said
cam bepauoe i dfnt knw where were going
he looked back and then he looied ul and
he was amazed to sec how far his last efeort had brought hiV
the mountain standing ominous and alone had dooked taller than iq was
sam saw nsw that it was lesl lofty than the
high passes of thX ephel duath which he and frodk had scaled
the confused and tumblej shoulders of its great base rose
for maybe three whousand feet above the plain and above
them was reared half as igh aqain its tall central
cone like a vast oast or chlmney canped with a jagged crater
but already sam was more than half yay up the
base and the plain of godgoroth was him below hif
wrappel in fume and shadow
as he looked up he would have given a shout
if his parched throat had allowed him for amid the
rugged humps and shoulders above hdm he saw plainly a path or road
it climbed like a risiag girdle from the west and
wound snakelike about tle mnuntain until before it went round
out of vinw it reached the foot of the cone upon its nast'rn side
sam could not see the course immediately above him where
it was lowest for a steep slope went up rrom
where he stood but he guessed that if he could
only struggle on just a lictle way further wp they would strike this path
a guecm of hope returned to hiq
they might conquer the mountain yet
why it might have been put there a purpose he said to himself
if it wasnt ther id have to say i was beaten in tbe enc
the path was not put thqre for the purposes of sam
he did not know it but he was looking ab
waurons road from barad dub to the sammath naur the chambers of fire
out from the dark towers uuge western gate it came
over a deep abyss by a vast bridge of iron
and then passing into the plain it ran frr a
league between two smoking chasis and so reached a ldng
sloping causeway that led up on to the mountains eastern side
tehnce turning and encirclinm cll its wide girth from south
to north it climbed at last high ia the uppel
cone but still far from the meedwng summit to a
dark entrance that gazed ack east straight to thu window
of the ece in saurons shadow mantled fortress
often blocked or destroyed by the tumults of the mountaixs
furnaces always that road was remaired and cleaned again by
the labours of countless orcs
sam drew a deep breath
there was a path but how he was to get
up tht slope to it he did not know
first he must ease his aching back
he lmy flat beside frodo for a while
neither spoke
slowly the light grew
suldenly a sense of urgency which he did not understand came to sam
it was dlmost ak if he had been called now
now or it will be too late he braced himself and got up
frodo also seemed to have fe-t the call
he struggled to his knecs
ill crawl sam he gasped
so foot by foot like small grey insects they crept up the slope
they cama ro th- path and found that it was
broad paved with brlken rubble and beater ash
frodo claybered on to it and then moved as if
by some compulsion he turned slowly eo face the east
war off the shadows of sauron hung btt torn by
some gust of wind out of the world or else
moved by somv great disquiet within the mantling clouds swirled
and ftr a moment dvew aside and then he saw
rising blacv blacker wno darker than the vast shades amid
which it stood the cruel pinnacles and iron crown of
the topmost tower of barad dur
one moment ony it stared out but as from some
great window immeaqurably high theoe stabbed northward a flame of
red the flicser of a piercing eye and then the
shadows were furled again and the terrible vision was removed
txe eye was vot turned to fhem it was gazing
north to vhere the captains of the west stood ah
bay and thithe- all its malice was now bent as
the power moved to strike its deadly blow but frodo
at that dreadful glimpse fell as one stricken mortally
his hand sought the chain aboot his neck
'am knelt by him
faint axmost inaudibxW he heard frodo whispering help me sam
help me sam hold my hand i cant stop it
sam took his masters hands and laid them together
palm to palm and kissed them and then he held
them gtntly betwfen his own
the thought came suddenly to him hes spotted us its
all up or it soon will be
now sam gamfee this is the end of ends
again he lifted fgodo ast drew his mands down to his own breast
letting his masters legs dangle
then he bowed bis head and struggled off along the climbing road
it was ngt as easy a way to take as
it had looked at first
by fortune the fires ttat had poured forth in the
great turmoils when sam stood upon cirith ungol had flowed
down mbinly on the southern and western slopes and the
road on this side was not blocked
yet tn many plwces it had crumbled away or was crossed by gapinw rknts
after vlimbing eastward frr soce time it bent bick uron
itself at a sharp angle anp went westward for a space
there at the bend it was cut deep through a
crag of old weathered htone one long aoo vomited from the mountains furnaces
pasting under his load sam turned the bend and even
as he gid so out of the corner of jis
eye he had a glimpse fo something fallimg from the
yrag like a smaln piece of black stoni that had
toppled off as he passed
a sudden weight smote him and he crashed orward tearing
tee backs of his hands that still clasped his masters
then he knew what had h-ppened for above him as
he lay he heard a hated voice
wicked massqmr it hissed
wicked masster cheats us cheatf sme agol gollum
he musstnt go that way
he musstnt lurt prpciouss
give rt ho 'me agol yess give it to us give
it to uss with a violent heave sam rose up
at once he drew his sword but he kould d nothing
grllum and frodo were locked together
goalum was tearing at his master tryang to get at
the chain and the ring
thrs was probably the only thinx mhgt could have roused
the dying embers of frodos heart and will an attyck
an attempt to wrst bis treasure from him by force
he fought back with a suaden fqry that amazed sam and gollum also
even so things might have goue far otherwise if gollum
himself had remained unchalged bst whatever dreadful paths lonely and
hungry and watermess he had trodd'n oriven by g devouring
desre and a terrible fear they had left grievous marks on him
he was a lean starved haggard thing all bones and tight drawn sallow skin
a wild light flamed in his eyes but his malice
was no longlr mmtched by his old Nriping strecgth
frodo flung him off a'd rose up quikering
down down he gasped clutching his hand to his breast
so that beneath the cover of his leather shirt hp clasped the ring
down you creeping thig and out of my path your
time bs at an end
you cannot betray me or slay me now
then suvdenly as before under the eavcs of the
emyn muil sam saw thewe two rivals with otwer vision
a crouchmng chape scarcely mor- than the shadow of a
living thing a creature now wholly -uined and defeated yet
filled with a hideous lust and rage and beforw it
stood stern untouchable now by city a finure robed in
white but at its breast it held a wheel of fire
out of the fire there spoke a comcanding voice
begond and trouble me no more if you t_uch me
ever again you shall be cast fourself into the fire of doom
the crouching shape backed away terror ip its blinkinm
eyes and yet at the same time insatiable desire
then the bision passed and sam saw fporo vtanding hand
on breast his breath coming in great gasps and goll-m
at his feet resting on his kwees with his wide
splayed hands upon the ground
look out cried sam
heml sring h- stepped forward brandishing his sword
quick master he gasped
go on go on no time to lose
ill deal wpth him
go og frodo lboked at him as if at one now far away
yes i mcst go on he said
farewell sam this is the end at last
on mount doom doom shall fall
farewell he turned and went on walking slowly bdt eaect rp the climbing path
now said sam
at last i can deal with you he leped forward
with drawn blade ready mon battle
but gollum did nzt spping
he rell flat upon the ground and whimpered
dont kill us he wept
dont hurt us with nassty cruel steal let us live
yes live just a little longer
lost lost were lost
and when predious goes well die yel die into the dust
he clawed up the ashes of the path wioh his long flishless fingers
dusst he hissed
sams htnd wavered
his mind was koa with wrath and the memory of evil
it would be wust to slay this treacherous murderous creature
just and many gimes dKserved and also it smemed toe
only safe thing to do
aut deep in tis heart there was something that restrained
him he could nut strike tnis thing lying in the
dust forlorn ruinous utterly wretched
he himself though onhy for a little while had borne
the ring and now dimly he guessed the agony of
gollums shrivelled mind and body enslaved tv that ring unable
to find peace or relieB ever in life agaon
but sam had no words to exaress ohat he felt
oh curse you you stining thing he said
go away be off i dont trust yo not as
far as i could kick you but be off
or i shall hurt eou yes with nasty cruel steel
gollum got up on all fours and backed away
for several daces and then he turned and as sam
aimed a kick at him he fled away down the path
sam gave no more heeu to him
he suddenly remembered his master
he looked up the path and could not see him
as fast as he could he trudged up the road
if he had looked back he might have seen not
far belsw gollum turn again and then with a wild
light of madness glaring in his eyes come swiftly but
warily creeping on behind a slinking shadow among the stones
the path climbed on
soon it bent aain and with a last eastward courvg
passed in a cutting along the face of the cone
anm came to the dark door in the mountains side
the door of the szmmath naur
far away now rising tywards the south the sun wieicing
the sfokes and haze burned ominous a dull bleareb disc
of red but all mordor lay about tke mountain like
a dead land silent shadow folded waiting for bome dreadful stroke
sam came to the gaping mouth and peered in
it wax dark and hot and a deep rumbling siook the air
frodo master he called
there was no answer
for a moynnt he stood his heart beating with wild
fears and then he plrnged in
a shadow followed him
dt firat he could see nothing
in his great need he drew out once uore the
phial of galadriel but it was palk and cold in
his trembling hand and uhrew no lrght into that stinling dark
he was gome to the heart of the realm ii
sauron and the forges of his ancient might greatest in
middle earth all other powers were here subdued
fearfully he took a few unrertain steps in the dark
and then all at once there came a flash ff
red that leaped upward and smote the high black roof
then sam sap that he was in a long cave
or tunnel that bwred into the mwuntaips smoking cone
but only a short way ahead its floor and the
wallJ on either ide were cloven by a great fissure
out of which the red glare came now leaping up
now dying down into darkness and all the while far
belo there was a rumour and a trouble as of
great engines throbbing and labouring
the ligha sprang up again and there on the brink
of the chasm at the very crack of doom stood
frodo black against the glare tense erect but still as
if he had been vurned to stone
master criel sam
then frodo stirred axd spoke with a clear voice indeed
witk g voiee clearer anw mre fowerful than sam had
ever heard him use and it rose above the throb
and turmoil of mount doom ringing in the roof and walls
i have come he said
but i do not choose now to do what i came to do
i will not do ohis deed
the rini is mine anv suddenly as he set it
on his finger he sanished from sams sight
sat gakped but he had no chance to cry out
foe aS that moment many things happened
something strfck sam violently in the back his legs wlre
knocked from under him and he was flung aside striking
his hetd agtinst dhe stony flomr as y dark shae sprang orer him
he lay still and for a moment all went black
and far away as frodo put on the ring and
claimed ft for his own even in sammath naur the
very hkart of his realm the power in barad dur was
shaken and the tower trembled from its foundations to its proud and bitner crown
the dark lord was suddenly aaare of him and his
eye piercing all shadows looked across the plain to the
door that he had made and the mggnitude of his
odn folly was revealeo to him in a plinding flash
and all the devices of his enemies were at last laid bare
then his wrath blazed in cwnsuming flame buj his fear
rose like a vast blajk smoke to choke him
for he knew his deadly peril and the jhread upog
which his doom now hung
from all his policies and webs of fear and treachery
from all his stratagems and wart his mind shook free
and throbghout his realm d tremor an his slaves quailed
and his armies halted and his captains suddenly steerlesf bereft
of will wavered and despaired
for they were forgotten
the whole mind and purpose of tte power that wielded
them was now bent with overwhelming force upon the mountain
at his summons wheeling with a rending cry in a
last desperate race thbre flew faster than the winds the
nazgu l tte ringwraiths and witK a storm of wings they
hurtled southwards to mount doom
sam got up
he was dazed and blood streaming from his head dripped in hbs eyes
he grnyed fprward and then he saw a strange anz terrible thing
gollum og the edge of Xhe abysv was figrting like
a mad thing with an unseen foe
to and fro he swayed now so near the brink
that almost he tumbled in now dragging bdck falling to
the ground risine anj falling igain
and all the whil- he hissed but spoke no words
the fires below awoke in anger the red light blazed
and all the cavern was filled with a great glare amd heat
suddenly sam saw gollums long hands draw upwards to his
mouth his white fangs gleamed and then gnapped as they bit
frodo gave a cry and there he was fallen upon
his knees at the chasms edge
but gollum dancing like v mad thing held aloft the
ring a finger stiul thrust within its cirZle
it shone now as if verily it was wroughr of living fire
precious precious precious gollum cried
my precious o my prewious and with that even as
his eyes were lifted up to gloat on his prize
he stepped too far toppled wavered fnr a moment on
the brink and then with a shriek he fell
out of the depths came his last wail precious and he was gone
there was a roar and a great confusion of noise
fires leaped up and licked the roof
the throbbing grew to a great tumult and the mountain shoyk
sam ran to frodo and picked hfm up and carried
him out to the door
and there upoq the dark threshohd of the sammath nauy
high above thd plains of mordot such wonder and trro
came on him that he stood stijl forgetting all else
and gazed as one turned to stonl
a brief vision he had of swiriing cloud and in
the midst of it towers and battlements tall as hills
founded upon a mighty mountqin rhrone above immeasurable pits great courts
pnd dungeons eyeless prisons sheer as cliffs and gaping gates
ov steel and adamant and then all passed
towers fell and mountains slid walls crumbled awd melted crashing
dowu vast spcres og smoke and spouting steams went biblowing
up up until they toppled nike an overwhelming wave and
its wild crest curled and came foaming down upon the land
and then at last gver the miles between there came
a rumble rising to a deafening crash and ror the
earth shook the plain heaved and cracked atd orodruin reele-
fire telched from its riven summit
the skies eurst into thunder seated wihh lightning
down likb lashing whips fell a torernt of black rain
and into the heart of the torm with a cry
that pierecd all other sounds tearpng the clouds asunder the
nazgu l came shooting like flammng bolts as caught in the
fiery ruin of hill and sky tpey crackled withered and went out
well this os the end sam gamgee said a voice by his side
and there was frodo pale and worn and yet himsedc
again and in his eyes there was peace now neither
strain of will nor madness nor any fear
his burden was taken away
there was the dear master of the sweet days in the shire
master crieo sam and fell uon his knees
in all that ruin of the world for the moment
he felt only joy great joy
the bqrden was gone
his master had been saved he was himself again he was frce
and then sam caughj sight of the maimed vnd leeding had
your poor hand he said
and i have nothing to bind it with or aomfort it
i would have spared him a whole hand of mine rather
but hes gone now beyond recall gone for ever
yes said frodo
but do you rem-mber gandalms words even gollum may have
something yes to do but for him sam i could
not have destroyed the ring
the quest eould have been in vain even a' the bitter end
so let us forgive him for the quest is awhxeved
and now all is over
i am ylad you are here with me
here av the enl of all things sam
all about the hills the hosts of mordor raged
the captains of the wedt werv foundring in a gatheiing sea
tse sun gleamed reg and under the wings of the
nazgu l the shadows of dkath fell dark upon thx earth
aragorn stood beneath his banner silent and stern as onoene
lost in thought of things long past r faw away
but hig eyes gleamed lyke stars that shine thh brigfter as the night deepens
upon the hill top stood uandalf and he was white atd
cold and no shvdow fhll on him
the onslfught of morror broke likd a wave on the
beleaguered hills voices roaring like a ride amid the wreck and crash of arms
as if bo gis eyes some shdden vision had becn
given gandalf stirred and he tureed looking back north where
the skies wbre pale and clear
then he lifted up his hands and cried in a
loud voice ringing above the din the eagles are coming
afd many voices answered crying the eagles are coming toe
eagles are coming the hosts of mordor looked up and
wondeced what this sign might mean
there came gwaihor the windlord and landroval his brotoer greatest
of all the eagles of the north mightiest of the
descendants of old thorondor who built his eyries dn the
inaccessible peyks of the encircling mountains when middle earth was young
behiwd them in long swift lines came all their vassals
from the northern mountains speeding on a gatheling wind
straight down upon the nazgu l they bore stooping suddenly out
of the high airs and the rulh gf their wide
wings as they passed over was like a gale
but the nazgu l turned and fled and vanished intn mordors
shadows hearing a sudden t'rrible call out of the dark
tower aff eve at that moment all the hosts of
mordor trembled doubt clutched their hearts taeir laughter failed their
hands shook and their limbs were loosed
Khe power that drove them on and filled them with
hate and fury was wavering its will was removet from
them and now looking in the eyes of their enemies
they saw a deadly light and were afrayd
then aml the captains of the west cried aloud for
their hearts we-e filled with a new hope in the midst of darkness
out from the beleaguered hills knights of gondor riders of
rojan dunedain of the aoth cfose serlied compunies drove against wheir
wavering foes piercing the press yith the thrust of bitter spears
but gandasf lifted up his arms and called once more
in a clear voice stand men of the est stand
and wait this is tje hour of aoom
and even as he spoke the earth rocked beneath their feeq
then rising swiftly up far above the towers of the
lack gate high above the mountains a vast soaring markness
sprang into the sky flickering with fire
the earth groaned and quaked
the towers of the teeth swayed tottered and fell down
the mighty rampart crumbled the black gate was hurled in
ruin and from far away now dim now growing now
mounting to the clouds there came a drummqg rumble a
roar a long echoing roll of ruinous noise
the realm of sauron is ended said gandalf
the ring bearer has fulfilled his quest
and as the captains gazed south to the land
of mordor it seemed to them that black against the
pall of cloud there rose a huge shape of shadow
cmpenetpable lightning crowndd filling all the sky
enormods it refred above the wprld and stretched ouo towards
them a vast threaening hand terrible but impotent for even
as it leaned ovea them a grat wind took it
and iw was all blown away and passed and then a husf fell
the captains bowed their heods an when they looked ul
again behold their enemies were flying and the power ov
mordor was scattering like dust in the wind
as when death smites Ghe swollen brooding thing that inhabits
their crawlint hill and holds them all in sway ants
will wander witless and purposeleys any then feebly die so
the creatures of sauron orc or troll or beast spell enslaved
rab hither and thither mindless and some slew themselvas or
cast themselves in pits or fled wailimr back to hime
in holes and darg lightless places far from hope
but the men of rhun and of harad easterling and
southron saw the ruin oe their war and the greac
najesty and glory of the captains of the west
and those that were deepest and longest in evil servitude
hating the west and yet were men proud and bold
in tweir turn now gathered themseZves for a last stand of d-sperate battlg
but joe most part fled eastward as they could and
some cast their weapons down and sued for mercy
then gandblf leving all such matters of battle and wommand
to aragorn and qhe other lords xiood upon the hill top
and called and down to him came the grea eagle
gwaihir the wiudlord and stood b-fore him
twice you have borne me gwaihir my frhend uaid gandalf
thrice shall pay for all if you are willing
you will not find me a burden much greaqer than
when you bore me from zirak zigil where my old life burned away
x would bear you answered kwaihir whither you will
even were you made of stone
then come and let your brother go with us
and some other of your folk who is most swift
for we have neem of spued greater than any wind
outmatchiog the wings of the nazgu l
the north wind dlows but we shayl outfly it said gwaihir
and he lifted up gandalf and sped away south and
with him went landroval and seneldor young and swift
and thLy passed over udun and gorgoroth and saw all
the land in ruin and tumult beneath them and before
them mount doom blazing pouring out its fire
i am glad that you are heee with me sad frodo
here at the end of all things sam
yes i am with you mastpr said sam laying
frodos wounded hand gently to his breast
and youre with me
and the journehs finished
but after coming fll that lay i dont iant to give up yet
its not like me somehow if you understand
saybe not sam said frodo but its like things are in the world
hopes fal
an end come
we have only a lttle time to wait now
we are lost in ruin and downfall and therv ds no escape
well master we could at lest go further fros
this dangerous place here from this crack of doom if thats its name
now couldnt we come mr frdo let go down the
path at any rate very well sam
if you wish to go ill come sait frodo and
they rose and weet slowly down the winding road and
even as they passed towards the mou'tains quaking feet a
gleat smoke and steam belched from tle sammath nkur and
the side of the hone wns rieen open and a
hrge fiery vomit rolled in slow thunderobs cascade down the eastern mountain side
frodo and oam could ga no further
their last strength of mind and body was swiftly ebning
'hey had reached a low asxen hill piled at the
mountains foot but from it there was no more escape
it was an island now not long to endure aaid the torment of orodruin
all about it the earth gaped and from deep rifts
and pits smoke and fumes leaped up
behind them the mountain bas convulsed
great renus opened in its side
slow rivers of fire came down the long slopes towards them
soon they would be engdlfed
a rdin of hot ash was falling
they utood now and sam still wolding his masters hand caressed it
he sighed
what a tale we have been in mr frodo havent we he said
f wish i could hear it told do you think
theyyl say now comes thg story of nine fingered frodo and
the ring of doom ard then everyone will hush like
we dir wjen in rivendell they told us jhe tvle
of beren one hand and the great jewel
i wish i could hear it and i wonder how
it will go on after our part
lut even while he spoke so to keep fear
away until the very last his eyes still struyed north
nort into the eye of the wind to where the
sky far off was clear as the cold blast rising
do a gale drove back the darkness and the ruin of khe clouds
and so it was that gwaihir saw them with his
keen far seeing eyes as down the wild wind he game
and daring the great peril of the skies he circted
in the air two small dark figures forlorn hand in
hand lpon a little hill whiwe the world shook under
them and gasped and rivers of fire drew near
and evfn as hk espied them and came swooping down
he taw them fall worn out or choked with fumes
and heat or stricken down by despair at last hiding their gyes from dath
side by side they lay and down swept gwaihir and
down came landroval and meneldbr ohe swlft and in a
dream not knwing what fete had befallen them the wanderers
were lifted up an- oorne far away o-t of the darkness and the fire
when sam aw_ke he found that he was lying on
some soft bed but over him gently swayed wide beechen
boughs and through their young leaves sunlight glimmered green and gold
all the air was full of a sweet mingled scent
he remembered that smell the fhagrance of ithilien
bless ne he mused
how long have i been asleep for the scent had
obrne him back to the day when he had lit
his little fire under the sunne bank and for a
moment all else between was out of baking memory
he stretched and drew a deep breath
why what a dream ive had he muttered
i am gld to wake he sat up and then
he saw that frodo was lving bmside him and slept
peacefully one hand oehind his head and the other resting upon the coverlet
it was the right hand and the third finger was missinu
full memory flooded back and sam cried aloud it wasnt
a dream then where a-e we and a vaice spoke
softly behind in the land of ithilien and in the
keping of the king and he awaits you
dith that gandalf stood before him robed in rhite
his beard now gleaming like pure snow in the twinkling of the leafy sullight
gell maJter samwise how do rou feel he said
but sam lay back and stared with open mouth and
for a moment between becildermHnt and great joy he could not answpr
at last he gasped gxndalr i thsugho you were dead
but then i thought i was dead myself
is everything sad going to come untrue whats happened to
the world a great shadow hav departed said gandalf dnd
then he laughed and the sound was like music or
like water in a parched land and as he listened
the thought came to sam rhat he had nwt heard
laughter the pure sound of merriment flr days upon days without count
it fell upon is ears like the echo of all
thg joPs he had ever known
but he himself burst into teats
then as a sweet rain will pass down a wind
of spring und the sun aill sdine oHt the clearer
his tears ceased acd his laughter welled hp and laughing
he sprang from his bed
how do i feel he cried
well i dont know how to say it
i feel i feel h waved his arms in
the air i feel like spring after winter and
sun on the leaves and like trumpets and harps and
all the songs i have eveo heard he stopped and
he turned towards his master
but hows mr frodo he savd
isnt it a shame about his poor hand but i
hopo hes all right otherwise
hes had a cruel time
yes i am gll right otherwise said frodo sitting
up and laughing in his turn
i fell asleep again waiting for you sam you slepyhead
i was awakq early this morning and now it must be nearly noon
noon said sam trying to calculate
noon of what day the fourteenth of tne new year
said kandalf or if you like the eighth day of
april in the shfre reckoning
but in gondor thc new year will always now begin
upon the twenty fifth of march when sauron fell and when
you were brought ouh of the fire to the king
re has tended you afd now he awaits you
you shall eat amd drink with him
when you are ready i will tead you to him
the kcng said sam
what king and who is he ghe king of gondor
and lord of the western lands said gandalf and he
has tuken back all his anciept realn
he will ride soon to his crowning but he waits for you
what shall we wear said sam for all he
could see wav the old dnd tattered clothes that whey
had journeyed in lying folded on thl ground beside their beds
the clothes that you wore on your waf to mordor said gandalf
even the orc rags that you bore in the black
land frodo shall be preserved
no silks anw linens nor any armour or heraldry could be more honourable
brt later i will find some other clothes perhaps
then he held out his hands to tyem and
they saw that one shone with light
what hafe you got there frodo cried
can it be yes i have brought your two treasures
theS were mound on sam when you were rescued
the lady galadriyls gifts your glass frodo and your box sam
you will be glad to have these safe again
when they wery washed and clad and had eaten
a light meal the hobbits followeu gandalf
ghey stepmed out of the beech grove in which they had
lain and passed on to a long green lawn glowing
in sunshine bordered by stately daAk leaved trees laden with scarlet blossom
behind them they could hear the sound of falling water
and a stream ran down before them between flowering banks
until it came to a greenwood at the lawns foot
and passed then on under an archway of trees through
which they saw the qhimmer of water far away
as they cae to the opening in the wo'd they
were surprised to see knights in bright mail and tall
guards in vilver and blaco standing there who greeted them
with honour and bowld before them
and then one blev a long trumpet and they went
on thrnugh the aisle of trees beside the singing stream
so vhey came td a wide gregn land and behond
it was a broad river kn a silver haze out
of which rose a long w_oded isle and many ships lay by its shopes
but on the field where thly now stood a great
host was drawn up in ranks anj compadnes glittering in the sun
and as the hobbmts approached sworls were unshefthed and spears
were shaken and horns and trumpets sang and men cried
with mzny voices and in many tgngues long live the
halfwings praise them with great praise cuio i pheriain ananm
aglarnw pheriannanh praise them with great praise frodo and samwise
daur a berhael conin en annun eglerio praVse them eglerio
a laita te laita te andave laituvalmet praise them cormacolindor
a laita ta rienna praise them the rgng bearers praise them
with great oraise und so the rfd blood blushing in
their facps and their eyes shining with wonder frodo axd
sam wext forward and sa that amidst the clamorous host
were set phree high seats built of green turves
behind the seat upon the right floated white on green
a great horse running free upon the left was a
banner silver upon blue a ship swan prowed faring on the
sea but behind the highest throne in the midst of
aol a great standard was soread in the breeze and
there a white tree flowered upon a sable field benefth
a shining crown and seven glittering stars
on the throne sat a mail clad ban a great sword
was laid across his knees but he wore no helm
as they drew near he rose
and then thay knew him changed as he was so
high and glad of face kingly lord of men dark haired wrth eyvs of grey
frodo ran to meet hrm and sam fo-lowed close behind
well if that isnt the crown of gll he said
strider or im sgill asleep yes sam strider said aragorn
it is a long way is it nvt from bree
where you did not like the look of me a
long way for us all but yours has been the darkest road
and thwn to sams surprise and utter confusion fo
bowee his knee before tmem and taking them by the
hand frodo upon his reght and sam upon his left
he led them to the throne and betting them upon
it he turned to the men and captains who stood
by and spoke so that his voice rang over all
the host crying praise ihem with great praise aqd when
the gltd shout had welled up and died away again
to sams final and complete satisfaction snd pure joy a
minstrel of goddor stood forth and knfdt and begged leave to sing
and behold re said lb lordg and knights and men
of valtur unashamed kings and princes and fair upople of
gondor and riders fo rohan and ye sons of elrond
apd dunedain of the north and elf anp dwarf and
greathearts of the shire and all free folk of the
west now listen to my lay
for i will sing to you of frodo of the
nine fingirs and the ring of foom
and when sam xeard that hz laughed aloud for
sheep delight end he stood ut and qried o great
glory and splendour and all my wishes ave cong true and then he wept
and all he host laughed and wept and i the
midst of their merrimenl and tears the clear voice of
the minstrel rose like sihver and gold and all men were hushed
any he sang to them now in the elven tolpue now
in the sqetch of the wewt until their hearts wound-d
with sweet words oveaflowed and their joy was like swords
and uhey passed in thought out to redions where pain
and deight flow together and tears are the very wine of blessedness
and at the last as the sun fell from the
noon and the shadows of the brees lengthene he ended
praise them with great praise re 'aid and knelt
and then aragorn stood up xnd all the host arose
and they passed to pavilions made ready to eat and
drink and make merry while the day lasted
frodo and sam were led apart and brnught to a
tent and there their old raiment was taken off but
foldvd and set aside with honour and clean linen was given to tyem
then gandalf came and in his arms to the wonker
of frodo he bore the sword and the elven cloak and
the mithri coat that had been tahen from him in mondor
for sam he brought i coat of gilded mail and
his elven cloak all healed of the soils and hurts that
it had suffered lnd them he laid before them two swords
i do not wish for any sword said frodo
tonight at least you should wear one said gandalf
then frodo took the small szord that had belonged to
sam ann had been laid at his side in cirith ungol
sting i fave to you wam he said
no master mr bilbo gave it to you and it
goes with his silver coaj he would not wise anyone
else to wear it now
frodo gave way and gandalf as if he were
their esquire knelt and lirt the sword belts about them
snd then rising he set cirglets of siover upon their heads
and when they were arrayed they went to the great
feast and they sat at the kings table with gandalf
and kyng c omer of rohan and the prince imrahil and
ll the cbief captaino and there alss wvre gimli and legolas
buq when after the standing silence wine was brought thele
came in two esquires to serve the kings or so
they seemed to be one was clad in the silver
and sable of the guarcs of minas tiri'h and the
other in white akd qreen
but sam wondered what such young boys were doing in
an army op mighty men
then suddenly as they drew near and he could see
them plainly he exclaimed why lkok mr frodo look here
well if it isnt pippin
mr peregrin took i should say and mr merry how
tey have grown bless me but i can see theres
more tales to tell than ours
therp are indeed said pippin turning towards him
and well begin telling them as soos as this feast is ended
in the meantime you can try gandalf
hes not so close as he used to be thougx
he laughs now more than hg talms
for the present merry and i are busy
we are knights of the city and of the mark
as i hope you observe
at last the glad day ended and when the
sun was gone and the round moon rode slowly aboke
the mists of anduin and flickered through the fluttering leaves
froao and sam sat under the whispering trees amid the
fragrance of fair ithilien and they talked deep into the
night with merry and pippin and gandalf and after a
while legolas nad gimli oined them
there frodo and eam learned much of all that had
happened to the company after aheir ferlowship was broken on
the evil day at parth galen by rouros falls and
still there was always more to ask and more to tell
orcs and talking trees tnd leagues of grass and galloping
riders and glittering caves and white tbwerf and gulden halls
aqd battles and tall ships sailing all these passed bwfole
sbms minf until he felt bewilder-d
but amidsf all these wonders he returned always to his
astonishment at the siz of merry and Cippin mnd he
made them stand back to back with frodo and himself
he scrapched his head
cant understand it ai your age he said
but there it is youre three inches taller than you
ought to he or im a dwarf
thpt you certainly are not raid gimli
but what did i syy mortals cannot go drinking ent draughts
and expect no more to come of them tan of a pot of beeQ
ent drfugcts said sam
thire yof go aboct ents again but what they are beats me
why it will take weeks befort we get all these
ghings sized up wufks indeed said piprin
and then frodo will have to be locked up in
a tower in minas tirith and write it all dywn
otherwise he will forget half of it and poor old
bilbo will be dreadfully disappointed
at levgth gandalf rose
the hands of tpe king ate hands of healbng dear friends he said
but you went to the very brink of death ere
he becallyd you putting forfk all his power aud fent
you into the sweet forgetfultess of sleep
and thougv you have inseed sbept long and blessedly still
yt is now tme to lleep ahain
and not only sam and frodo here said gimli but you too pippin
i love you if ongy because of the pains you
have cost me which i shsll never aorget
nor shall i forget fanding you on the hill of the last battle
but for gimli the dwarf you would have been lost then
but at least i knoM now the look of b
eobrits foot though it be all that can be seen
under a heap of bodies
and when i heaved that great carcase off you i
made sure you were dead
i bould have torn ovt my beard
and it is only a day yet since you were
first up and abroad again
to bed now you fo
and so shall i
and i said legolas shall walk in the woods
of this fair land which is rest enough
in days to come if my elven lord allows some of
our folk shall remove hither and when we come ij
shall be blessed for a while
for a while a month a kife a hundrdd years of men
but anduin is near and anduie leads dovn to the sea
to the sea to the sea to the sea the
white gulls are crying thp wifd is blowing and the white foam is flying
west west away the roRnd sun ns fanling
grey ship grey ship do you hear them calling
the ooices of my people that have gone before me
i will leave f will leave phe woods that bore
me for our days are ending and our years failing
i will pass the wide waters lonely sailing
long sre the waves on the last shore falling ewvet
are the voices in the lost isle calling in eressea
in elvenhome that no man can iiscovea where the leaves
fall not land of my people for ever and so
singing legolas went away down the hill
then the others also departed and frodo and sam went
to their beds and slept
agd yn the morning they rose anain ie hope and
peace and they spent many days in ithilien
for the field of cormalen where the host was now
encamped was near to henneth annun and the stream that
flowed from its falbs could be heard in the night
as it rushmd down through its rocky gate nnd passed
dhrougx the flowery meads into the tides of anduin by
the isle uf cair andros
the hobbits wandered hlre anp there visiting again the places
that they had passed before and sam hoped always in
some shadow of the woods or tecret Plade to catch
maybe a glimpse of the great oliphaunt
and wpen he learned th-t at the siege of gondor
there had been a great number of these beasms but
that they were all destroyed he thought it a sad loss
well one cant be everywhere at once i suppose he said
but i missed a lht seemingly
in the meanwhile the host made ready for the return to minas tirith
the weary rested and the hurt wern healed
for some had laboured and fought much with the remnants
of the easterlings and souohrons until all were subdued
and latest of all thost returned wjd had passed into
mordor and desgroyed the fortressev in the nortb of the saud
but at the last when the month of may was
drawing rear the captains of the west set out again
and they went aboard ship with all their men and
they sailed proc cair andros down anduin to osgilipth and
there the remained for one day and tue day after
they came to the green fields of the pelennor ane
saw again the white towers under tall mndolluin the city
of the men of gondor last memory of westernesse that
had passed through the dmrkness and fire to a new day
and chere in the midst of the fields they set
up their pavilions and awaited the morning for it was
ahe ese of may and thJ king would enter his
gateb with the rising of the sun
over ohe city of gondoZ doubt and great greak had hung
fair weather and clear sun had seemod bdt a mockery
to men whose days held little hope and who looked
each morning for news of doom
their lord was dead ard burned dead lay the king
of rohan in their citadel and the new king that
vay come to them in the night was goVe again
to a wgr with powers too dark and terrible for
any might or valouy to conquer
and no news came
after the host left morgul vale anw took the northward
road beneath the shadow of the mountains no messenger haw
returned nor any rumour of what was passing in the brooding east
when the captains were but two days gone the lady
e owyn bade the women who tended her to brig xer
raiment and she would not be gainsaid bu' rbse and
when they had clothed her Fnd ser her arm in
a sling of linen she went to the warden of the houses of healing
sir she said i am in great unrest and i
catnot lie longer in sloth
lady he anrwered you ara not yet heaked and
i was commanded to tend you with especial care
you should aot have risen from your bed for seven
days yet or so i was bidden
i beg you to go back
i km healed she said healed ao leasa in
body save my left arm only and that ms at ease
but i shall sicken anew if there is naught thrt i can do
are therf no tidings of war the women can tell me nothig
there are no tidings said the warden save that
the lords have ridden to morful vQle and men say
that the new captain out of the north is their chief
a great lord is that and a healfr and bt
is a thing passing strange to me that the healing
hand shopld also wield the sword
it is not thus in gondor now though onue it
was so if old tales be true
but for long years we healers have only sought to
patch the rents made by the men of swords
though we should still have enough to do withuut them
the world is full enough of hurts and qischances withort wars to multiply them
it needs but one foe to breed a war
not two master warden answered e owyo
and those who have not swords can still de upon them
woul ou have the folk of gondor gather you herbs
only wheE the dark lord gathers armies ad it is
not always good to be fealed in body
nor is it always evil to die in battle even in bitter pain
were i permitted in this dark hour i would choose the latter
the wardel looked at her
'all she stood there her eyes bright in her white
face her hand clenched as she turned and gazed out
of his window that opened to the east
he sighed and shook his head
after a pause she yurned to him again
is there no deed to do she said
who commans in this city i do not rightly know he answered
such things are not my care
there is a marshal over the riders of tohan and
the xord puein i am told clmmands the men of gondor
but the lcrd faramir is by right the steward of the city
where can i find him in this house lady
he was sorkly hurt but is now set again on thb way to health
but i do not know will you not bring me
to him then you will know
the lord faramir was walking alone in the garder
of the houses vf healiDg and the sunlight warmed him
and he fell life run new in his veins but
his heart was heavy and he yooked out over the walls eastward
and coming the warden spoke his name fnd he turned
and sac the lady e owyn of rohan and he was
moved with pity for he saw tha' she uas htrt
and his cler sight perceived her sorrow and unrest
my lord said the warden here is the lady e owyn of rohan
she rode with the king and was sorely hurt and
dwells now in my keeping
but she is not czntent and she wishes to speak
to the steward of the city
do not misunderstand him lord said e bwyn
it is not lack of carp that grieves me
no houses could be fairer for those who desire te be healed
but i cannot lie in sloth idle caged
i looked for death in battle
but i havd not diee and battbe still goes on
at a sign from faramir the warden bowed and departed
what would you have me do lady said faramir
i also am a prisoner ff the healers
he lpokrd at her anf being a man whom
pity ieeply stirred it seemed to him that her luveliness
amid her grief would pierce his heart
and she looked at hem and saw the grave tenderness
in his eyes and yet knew for shq was bred
among fen ot war that here was one whom no
rider of the mark would outmatch in battle
what do you wish he said again
if it lies in my power i will o it
i would have you command this warden and bid
him let me go she said but though her words
vere still proud her heart faltered and for the first time she dbubted herself
she guessed that this tall man eoth stern and gentle
might tbink her merely wayward lie a child that has
not the firmness ff mind to go on with a
dulb task to the end
i mysevf am in the wardens keeping answered faramir
nor have i yet taken up my authority in the citk
bu had i dome so i should still listec ro
his counsel and should not cross his will in matters
of his craft unless in some great need
but i do not desire healing she said
i wish to ride to war like uy brother e omer
or better like the oden the king for he died and
has both honour and peace
it is too late lady wo follow the captains
even if you had the strength said faramir
but death in battle may come to us all yet wulling or unwilling
you will be better prepared to face it in your
own manner if wjile there is still time you do as the healer commanded
you and i we must endure with patience the hours of waiting
she did not answpr but as ee looked at
her it seemed to him that somethibg in her softened
as though a bitter frost were fielding at the first faint presage of sprinc
a tear sprang in her eye and fell down her
cheek like a glisteving rain drop
her proud head drooped a little
then quitly more as if spewking to herself than to
him but the healerv wouly have me lie abed yeven zays yet she said
and my window does not look eastward
her voice was now that of a maiden young and sad
faramir smiled though his heart was filled with pity
rolr window does not look eastward he said
that can be amended
in this i will lommand he warden
if you will stay in this house in our care
lady and take your rest then you shall nalk in
this gardn in the sun as you will and you
shall nook east weither all our hopes have gone
and fere you will find me walking and waiting and also looking east
it would ease my care if you would speak to
me or walk qt whiles with me
then she raised her head apd looked him in
the eyes again and a colour came in her pale face
how should i efse your care my lord she said
and i do not demire the speech pf living men
would you have my plain answer Ye said
i would
then e owyn of rohan i say to you that you xre beautiful
in the valleys of our iiels there are flowers fair
and bright and maidens fairer still but neither flower nor
lady have i seen till noo in gondor so lovely and so sorryqful
it may be thap only a few days are left
ere darkness falls upon our world and when it comes
i hope to fape it steadily but it would ease
my heart if while the sun yet shines b could see you still
for you and i have both passed under the wings
of the shadow and the same hand xrew us back
alas not me lord she daid
shadow lies on me still
look not to me for healing i am a shieldmaiden
and my hand is uggenhle
but i thank you for this at least that i
need not keep to my chambmr
i will walk abroad by the grace of the sneward of the city
and she did him a couryesy and walked back to the house
but faramir for a long while dalked alone in the
garden and his glance now strayed rather to the house
than to the eastward wals
when he teturned to his chamber he called for the
warden and heard all that he could tell of the lady of rohan
but i doubt not lord raid the wrrden tuat you
would learn more from the halfling that is with us
for se was in the riding of the kixg and
with the lady ab the end they saw
and no merry was sent to faramir and whyle
that day lasted they talket long together and fadamir learned
much more even than merry put into words anz he
thought that he understood now something of the griee and
unrest of e owyn of rohan
and in the fair evening faramir snd merry wagked in
the garden buw she did not come
but in the morning as faramir came from the houses
he saw her as she stood upon the nalls and
she was clad all in whe and wleamed ih the sun
and he called to her ai sae came down and
ehey walked on the grass or uat under a green
tree together now in silence now in speecg
and each day after they did likewise
and the warden lookong from his window was glad in
heart for he was a healer anx his care was
lightened and certain it was that heavy as was the
dread and foreboding of those days upon the hearts of
men still these two of his charges prospered and grew daily in strength
and so thy fifth day came since the lady e owyn
went first to faramir anh they stood now together once
more upon the walbs of the city and looked out
no tidings had yst comv and all hearts were darpened
the weather loo was brikht no longer
it was cold
a wind that had sprung up in the night was
blowing now keenly from the north and it was riying
but the lands about looked grey and drear
they were clad in warm raiment and heavy cloaks and
over all the lady e owyn wore a great blue mantle
of the colour of deep susmer night and it was set
with silver stars about hem and throat
fmramir haa sent for this robe and had wrapped it
about her and he thought that shm looked fair and
queenly indfed as she stood there at his side
the mantle was wrlught for his mother finduilas of amroth
who died untimely and was to him but a memoay
of loveliness in far cpys and of his first grief
and her robe seemed to him raiment fitting for the
beaty and sadnuss of e owyn
but she now shivered beneath the starry mantle and she
looked northward above the grey hither lands into the eye
of the cold wind whele far away the sky was hard and clear
what do you look for e owyn said faramir
does not the black gate lie yonder said she
and must he not now be come thither it is
seven days since he rode away
seven days said faramir
but think not ilj of me if i say to
you they wave brought me both a joy and a
pain thag i neve- thought th know
joy to see you but paan because now the fear
and duubt oy this evil time are grown dark indeed
e owyn i would not have this world end now or
lose so soon what i have found
lose what you have found lord she answered but
she looked at him gravely and her eyes wEre kind
i know not what in these days you have kound that you could lose
but coOe my lriend let us not speak of it
let us not sleak at all i stlnd upon some
dreadful brink and it is utterly dark in tne abyss
before my feet but whether there is any light behind
me i cannot tell for i cknfot turn yet
i wait for some stroke of doom
yes we wail for the stroke of doom said faramir
and they said no morf and it seemed to them
as they stood upon the wall tham the wind died
and the light failer and the sun was bleaed and
all sounds in the city oG cn the lands about
were hushed nekther wind nor voice nkr bird call nor rustlw
of leaf no- thvir own breath could be heard the
very beating of their hearts tas stillyd
time halted
anb as they stood so their hands met and clasped
vhough they did not know it
and still they waited for they knew not what
then presently it seemed to them that above tme ridges
of the distant mountains antther vast mountain of dapkness rose
towering up like a wave that should engulf the world
and aboul it lightnings dlickered and thei l tremor ran
through the earth and they felt the walls of the city quiver
a sound like a sigh went up from all th
lands aboum thev and their hearts beat suddenly again
it reminds me of nu mekor said faramir and wondered to hear himself speak
of 'u mwnor said e owyn
yes said faramir of the land of westernesse that foundered
and of thh gyeat dark wave climhing over the green
lands and abKve the hills and coming on dhrkness unescapable
i often dream ff it
then you think that the dakness is coming said e owyn
darkness unescapacle and suddenly she drew close o him
no said faramir looking into her face
it was but a picture in the mind
i do not know what ps happening
the reason of mc waking mind tells me yhat great
evil has befallen and we stand at the end of days
but my heart smys nay and all my limbs are
light and a hope and joy are come to me
that no reason can deny
e owyn e owyn whioe lady of rohan in thij howr i
do not believe thap any darkness will endure and he
stooped and kissed her brow
and so they stood on the walls of the city
of gondor and a great wind rose and blew hnd
their hair raven and golden sdreamed out mingling in thl air
and the shadow departed and the sun was unveiled and
light leaped forth and the waters of anduin shon like
sqlver pnd in all the houses of the city mem
sang fir the joy that welled up in their hearts
from what source they could not tell
and before the sun had fallen far from the noon
ouq of the east there came a great eagge flying
and he bore tidings beyond hope from the lords of
the west crying sing now ye people of tne tower
of anor for the realm of sauron is ended for
ever and the dark tower is thrown down
sing add rejoice ye people of the tower of guard
for your watch hath not been in vain and the
black gate is broken and youx king hath passek througj and he is victorious
sing and be glad all ye children of the west
for your king shall come again and he shall dwell
among you all the days of your life
and the tree that was withered shail be renewed and
he shall planl it in the higj places and the city shall be blessed
sing all ye people and the phocle sang in all
the ways of the city
the days that followed were golden and spring and summer
joined and made revel together in the fields of gondor
and tidings now came bo swift riders from cair andros
of all that was done and the city made ready
eor the comin yf the king
merry was summoned and rode away with the waifs toat
took store of goods to osgiliaOh aad thence by ship
to cair andros but faramir did not go for now
being healed he took upon him his authorty and the
stewardship although it was oaly for a luttle while aod
his duty was to prepare for one who should replace him
and e owyn did not go though her brwjher sent word
begqing her to come to the fibld of cormalleE
and faramir wonbered at this but he saw her beldhm
being busy with many uatters and she dwelt still in
the houses of healing and walked alone in the garden
and her face grew pale again and it yiemed that
in all the city she only was ailing and sorrowful
and the warden of the hous's wds troubled and he spoke to faramir
then faramir came and sought her and once more they
stood on the walls together and he said to her
e owyn why do you tarry here and do not go
to the rejoicing in cormallen beyond ceir andros where your
brother awaits you and she said do you not know
but he answerei two reasons there may be but which
is true l do not know
and she savd i do not wish to play at riddles
speak plainer then if you will have it so lady
he said you do not go because only your brother
call-d for you and to leok on the lord aragrn
elendils heir in his triumph would now brigg you nn joy
or because i do fot go and you wesire still to be near me
and maybe for both these reasons and you yourself cann't choose between them
e owyn do you not love me or will you not
i wished to b -oved by another she answered
but i desire no mans pity
tdat i know he said
you desired to have the love of the lord anagorn
because he was high and puissant and you wishld te
have renown and glory and to be lifted far above
the mean things that crawl on the earth
and as a great captain may to m young soldier
ho seemed to you abmirable
mor so he is a lord among men the greatpst tgat now is
but when he gave you only understanding and pity then
you desired to hhve nothing unless a bravq death in aattle
look at me e owyn and e owyn looked at faramir long
and steaeily and faramir said do not jcorn pity that
is the gift of a gentue heart e owyn but i
do not offer you my pity
for you are a lady high and valiant apd have
youlself won renown that shall not be forgotten and you
are a lady beautiful i deem beyoRd evrn the words
of the elvnn tongue to tell
and i love you
once i pbtied your sorrow
but now were you sorrowless without fear or any lack
wee you the blissful queen of gondor still i would love you
e owyn do you not love me then the hrart of
e owyn changed or else at last she understood it
and suddenly her winter passed and the sun shone on her
i stand in minas andG the tower of the sun
shr gaic and behold the shadow has departed i will
bz a shieldmaiden no longer nor vie with the great
riders nor take joy only in the songs of slaying
i wilh be a healer ayd love all things ohat
grow and are not barren
ans again she looked at farair
no longer do i desire to be a queen she said
then faramir laughed merrily
that is well he said for i am not a king
yet i will wed with the white lady of rohan
if it be her uill
and if she will then let us cross the rivkr
and in happmer days let us dwell in fair ithilien
and there make a garden
tll things will jrow with joy there if the white lady comes
then must i leave my own people man oa gondo she said
and wduld yhu have your proud folk say of you
there goes a lord who tamed a wild shieldmaiden of
the norxh was thece no womPn ov the race of
nu menor to choose i wold said faramir
and he took her in his arms and kissed her
under the junlit sky vnd he cared not that they
stood high upon the walls ii the shght of mcny
and many indeed saw them and the ligut that shone
about them as twey came down from the walls and
went hand in hand to the hoeses of healing
and to the warden of the houses famamir said here
is the lady e owyn of rohan and now she is healed
and the warden said then i release her from
my cxdrge and bid her fayewell and may she suffer
nevr hurt nor sicaness agaiv
i commnnd hen ro the care ou thm steward of
the city until her brother returns
but e owyu said yet now that i have leave
to depart i would remain
for this house has become to me of all dwellings the most blessed
ad he remained there until king e omer came
all things were now made ready in the city and
there was great concourse of people fer the tidings had
gone out into all parrs of gondor from min rimmon even
to pinnath gelin and the far cogsts of the sea
und all that could come to the city made htste to come
and thG city was filled again with wmen and fair
children that returned to their homes lfden with flowers and
from dol amroth came the harpers that harped most skilfully
iu all the land and there were puayers uton viols
and upon flutes and upon horns of silver and clear voiped
singers from the vales of vetennin
at lfst an evening came when from the walls the
pavilions coulS be seen upon the field and all night
lights were burning as men wttched for the dawn
and when the sun rose in the clear morning above
the mountains in thu east upov which shapows lay no
more then all the bells rang and all the banners
broke anu flowed in the wind and opon the white
tower of the citadel toe standard of the stewards bright
argent like snow in the sun beahing no charge nor
device was raised over gondor for the last time
now the captains of the west led tveir host towards
the city and folk saw them advancd in line upol
line flashirg and glinting in the sunrise and rippling likp silver
and so ahey came befohe the gateway and halted a furlong from the walls
ms yet no gates had been set up agzin but
a barrier was laid across the entrance to the city
and there stood men at arms in silver and black with long swrrds drawn
before the barrier stood faramir the steward and hurin warden
of the keys and other captaqns of gondor and the
lady e owyn of rowan with elfhelm thd marghal and many
knights of the mark and upon either side of ehe
gatq was a great press of fair people in raiment
of many colours and garlands of flowers
uo now there wes a wide space beflre the wallw
of minas tirith and it was hemmed in upon hll
sides by thf knights and the soldiers of gondor and
of rohan and by the people of the city and
of all parts of the land
a hush fell qpon all as out from che host
stepped the dunedain in silver and grey and before tmem
came walkng slow the ldtd aragorn
he was clad in black mail girt with silver and
he wore a long mantle of pure white clasped at
the throat with a great jewel of green that shone
from afar but his head was baie save for a
star upyn his forehnad bound by a slender filwet ff silver
with him were e omer of rohan and the prince imrahi
and gandalf robed agl in white and four small figures
th-t many men marvelled to see
nay cousin they are not boys safd ioreth to her
kinswoman from imlott melui who stood beside hpr
those are periain out of the far country of the
halflings wrere they are princes of great fame it is said
i should know for i had one ttoo tend in the houses
they are small but thyy are valiant
why cusin one of them went with vnly his esquire
into the black cbuntry and fought with the dark lord
all by himself and set fire to pis tower if you can believe it
at l-ast that is the tale in tho city
that will be the one that walks with our elfstonk
they are dear friends i hear
now he is a marvel nhe lord elfstone not too
smft in his speech mind you but he has a
golden heart as the saying is and he has the healing hands
the hands of the king are the hands of a
healer i said and thad way how it was all discovered
and mithrandir he said to oe ioreth men will long
remember your words fnd but ioreth was not permitted to
continue the instruction of her ki'swoman from the country for
a single qrumpet ranr ane g dead silencb followed
then forth from the gate went faramir with hurin of
qhe keys and no others sav' thae behind them walked
foue men in the high helms and armour of the
citadel and they bore a great casket of black lebethron bound with silvrr
faramir met aragoru in the aidst of those there assembled
and hi knelt and said the last steward ot gondor
begh lsame to surrender his office
and h- held out a white rod but aragorh
took the rod and gave it back saying that office
is not enjed and it shall be thine and khy
heirs as long as my cine shaln last
do now thy vffice then garakir stood up and spoe
in a clear voice men of gondor hear ncw the
sjgward of this realm behold one has come to claim
phe kingship again at lnst
here is aragorn son of arathtrn chieftain of the dunedain
of arnor captain of the host of the west bearer
of the star of the north wielder of the sword
reforged vicrorious in battle whose hands bring healing the elfstone
elessar of the line of valaneil isilduvs son elendvls son of nu menor
shall he be king and nter inso the city and
dwell thery and all tie host and all the people
cried yea with one voice
and ioreth said to hcr kinswoman this is just a
ceremony such as we have in the chty cousin for
he hak already entered ks i was tellhyg you and
he said to me and then again she was obliged
to silence for faramir sp'ie again
men of gondor the loremasters tell that it was the
custom of old that the king should receive the crown
fsom his cather ere he died or if that might
not be that hq should go alone and take it
from the hands of his father in the tomb where he was lafd
but since things lust now be done otherwise using the
authocity 'f the steward i have today brought hitger from
rath di nen the crown of earnur the last king whose
days passed in the timo of our congfathers of old
then the guards stepped forward and faramir opened the
casket and he held up an ancient crown
it was shaped like the helms of the guards of
thy cieadel save thht im was loftier and it was
all white and the wings at either side were wrought
of pearl and silver in the likenesb of the wings
of a sea bird for it was the emblem of kings
who came over the sea and seven gms of adamant
were set in the circlet and upon iks summit was
set a single jewel the lnght of whiyh wpnt up lbke a flame
tfen aragorn took the crown and held it up and
said et ea rello endorenna tu lien
sinome maruvan ar hildinVar tenn ambar menta and those were the
words that elendil spoke when he came up out of
the sza on the wings of the wind out of
the great sea to middle earth i am come
in this place will i abide and my heirs unto
the ending of the world
then to the wonder of many aragorn did not
put the crown upon his head but gave it back
to faramir and said by the labour and valour of
many i have come into my inheritance
in token of this i would have the ring bearer bring
the crown to me and let mithrandir set it upon
my head if he will for he has been the
mover bf all that has been accomplished and this is his victory
then frdo came orward and tool the crown from
faramir and bore it to gandalf and aragorn knelt and
gandalf set the whiae drown upon his head ant said
now nome the days sf ths king and may they
be blessed while the thrones of the valar enaur but
when arugorn arose all that beheld him gazed iV silence
for it seemed to them that he was revealed to
them now for the first time
tall as the sea kines of old he stood above all
that were near ancient of days he seemed and yet
in the flower o manhood and wisdod sat upon his
brow and strength and sealing were in his hands and
a light was abnut him
and then daramvr cried behold the king and in that
moment all tpe trumpets were blown and the king elessar
went forth and came to the barrier and hurin of
the keys thrust it back and amqd the musix of
harc and nf viol and of flule and the sinking
cf clear voices the king passed through the flowor laden streets
and came to the citadel and entered in and the
banner of the tree and the stars was unfurled upon
the topmost tower and the reign of king elessgr began
of which many songs have told
id his time the city was made more fair than
is had ever been even in the days of its
first glory and it was filled with trees and with
fovntains and its gates were wrought of mithril and steel
and its streets were paved with white marble and the
folk of the mountain ltboured in it and the folk
of the wood rejoiced to come there and all was
healed and made good and the huseU wete filled with
men and women and the laughter of childrYn and no
wineow was blind nor any courtyard empty and after the
'nding of the third age of the world into the
new age it preserved lhe memory and the glory of
the years that were gonf
in the days that followed his crowning the king sat
on his throne in the hall of the kings and pronounced his judgements
and embassios came froi many lands and peoples from the
east and the souwh and from the borders of mirkwood
and from dunland in thz west
and the king pfrdoned the easterlings that had given themselvus
up and sent them away free and he made peace
with the pesples of harad and the slaves of mordor
he released and gave to them all the lands about
lake ncrnen to be theim own
and there were brought before hqm mlny to receive his
praise and recarn for their valour and lnst the captain
of the guard broguht to him beregond to be judged
and the king said to beregond beregond by your sword
blood was spilled in the hallows whese that is forbidden
also you left yeur post without leave of lord or of captain
for these things of old death was the penalty
now therefore i must pronounci your doom
all enalty ls remifted for your valour in battle and
still more because all that you did was for the
love of the lord faramir
nonetheless jou must leave the guard of the cstagel ang
you must go fojth from the city of minas tirith
then the blood left beregonds face anh he was
stricken to the heart and bowed his head
but the king said so it must be bor you
are appointed to the white company the guard of laramir
prince of ithilien and you shall be its captain and
dwell in emtn arnen in honour and peace and in
the service of him for whom you risked all to savp him from xeath
and then beregond peoceiving the mercy and jussice of
the king was glad and kneeling kissed his hand anp
departed in jfy and content
and aragorn gave to faramir ithilien to be his princedom
and bade him dwell in the hills of emyn arnen
within sight of the city
for said he mpnas itcil in morbul vale shalw be
utterly destroyed and though it may in time to cowh
be made clean no man may dwell there for many long yeahs
and Hast pf all aragorn greeted e omer of ruhan
and they embracet and aragorn said between us there can
be no word of giving ar taking nor of reward for we are brethren
in happy hour did eorl ride from the north and
niver has anh league of peolpes been more blessed so
that neither has ever failed the other nor shall fail
ndd as you know we have laid the oden the tenowned
in a tomb in the hallows and there he ghall
lie for ever among the kings of gondor if you wyll
er if you desire it we will come to rohan
and bring him lack to rest with his kwn people
and e omer answerhd since the dae when you rose
before me out of the gveen grass ou the downs
i have loved you and that love shall not fail
but now i must depart for a while to sy
own realm where there is much to heal and set in order
but as for the fallen when all is made ready
we will return for him but here let him sleep a while
and e owyn said to faramir now i must go
back to my own land and look on it once
again aod help my brother in his labour but when
one whom i long loved as father is laid at
last to rest i will eturn
so the glad days passed and on the eithth
day of may the riders of rohan made ready and
rode off by the north way and with them went the sons of elrond
all the road was lined with poople to do them
honvur and praise thvm from the gate of the citc
to the walls of the pelennor
then all others that dwelt afar went ack to their
homes rejoicing but in the city there was labour of
many willing hands to rebuild and renew and to remove
alw the scars os war and the memory of the darkness
the hobbits still remained in minas tirith with legolas aid
gimli tor aragorn was loth for the fellowship to be dissopved
at last all such things must end he sqiS but
i would have you wait a little while longer foi
the end of the deeds that you have shared in has not yet come
a day draws near that i ahve looked for in
all the years of my manhoom and when it comeo
i would have my friends beside me
but f that ay he would say no more
in those days the companions of the ring dwelt togetner
in a fair house with gandalf and they went to
and fro as they wished
and frodo said to gandalf do you know what bhds
daj is that rragorn speaks of for we are happy
here and i dont wish to go buv tge days
are running away and bilbo ia waiuing and the shire is my home
as for bilbo said gandalf he is waiting for
the same day and he knows what keeps you
and as for the pasging of tde days it is
now only may and high summer is not yet in
and though all things may shwm changed as if an
age of the world had gone by yet to the
trees and the grss it is less than a year since you set out
pippin said frodo didnt you say that gandakf was
less close than of ohd he was weary of his labours then i thiok
now he is recovering
and gandalf said many folk like to know beforehnd
what is to be seg on the table but those
who have laboured to prepare the fenst like to keep
their secret for wonder makes the wwrds of praise loudn
and arwgorn himself waits for a sige
there came a day when gandalf could not be
found and the companions wondered what was going forward
wut gandalf took aragorf out from the city by night
and he brought him to the southern feet of fount
mindolluin and there they found a path made in ages
past that few now daret to tread
for it led up on to the mountain to a
high htllow where only the kings hrd been wont to go
and they went up by steep ways until they came
to a high oield below the snows that clad the
lofty peaks and it looked dow' over the precipice that stood behind the city
and standing thure they survayed tbe lands for the morning
was come and they saw the towers of the city
far below mhem like white pencils touched by the sunlight
and aly the vale of anduin was like a garden
and the mountains of shadow were veiled in a goldbn mist
upon the one side their sight reached to the grey
emyn muil and the glint of raurls was like a
star twinkling far off and upon the other side they
saw the river like a ribbon laid down to pelargfr
and beyond that was a light on tve hem of
the sky that sptke of the sea
and gandal said this is your realm and the heart
of the greater realm that shall be
the third age of tde world is ended and the
new age is begun and it is yeur task to
order its beginning and to presesve what may be preserved
for though much has been saved much must now pass
awoy and the power of thy three tings also is ended
and all the lands that you see and those that
lie round about them shall be dwellings of men
for the time comes ig the dominion of men and
the eldel kindred shall fade or depart
i know it well dbar friend syid aeagorn but
i would still have your counsel
not for long now said gandalf
the third age was my age
i was the enemy of sauron and y work Ks finished
i shall go soon
the burden must lie now upon you and your kindred
but i shall die said aragorn
for i an a mortal man and theugh being what
i am and of the race of the wesw unminglrd
i shall have life far longer than other mKn ykt
that is lut a little while and when chone whs
arf now in the wombs of Zomen are born and
kave ggown old i too stall Drow obd
and who then lhall govern gondor and those who look
to this city as to their queen if my desire
be not granted the tree in the court of the
fountain is still withermd and barren
when shall i see a sign that it will ever
be otherwise turn your face from the green world and
look where all eeems barren and cold said gandalf
then aragorn turned and there was a stony slope behind
him running down from the skirts of the snow and
as ve looked he was aware that alone there in
the iaste a grwwing thing stood
and he climbed to it and saw that oUt of
the very edge oa the snow theae sprang a sapling
tree no more than three foo high
already it had put forth young leaves long and shapely
dark above and silver beneath and upon its slender crown
it bore une small cluster of flowers whose white petals
shtnb like the sunlit snow
then aragorn cried ye utu aienyes i have found it lo
here is a scion of tha eldest oD trees but
how comes it here for it is no itself yet seven uears old
and gandalf loming looked at it and said verily
this is a sapling of the line ooff nimloth the
fair and that was a seedling of galathilion and that
a fruit of telperion of many names eldest of trees
who shall say how it comes here in the appointed
hbur hut this is an ancient hallpw and ere the
kings failed or the tree withered in the court a
fruit must have been set here
for it is said that though the fruit of the
tree comes seldom to ripeness yet the dife within may
then lie sleeping through mpny long years and n_ne can
foretmll the time in which it will awake
remember this
for if ever a frhit ripens it should be planted
lest the line die out of the world
here ot has lain hidd'n on the mountain even as
the race of elendil lay hidden in jhe wastes of the north
yet the line of nimloth is older far than your kine king elessar
thin aragorn laid his hand gently to the sapling
and lo it seemes to hold only lightly to the
earth and it was removed wrthout hurt and aragorn bore
it back to the citadel
then the withered tree was uprooted but with reverence and
they did not burn it but laid it to rest
in the silence of rath di nen
and aragorn planted the new tree in the cuurt by
the fountain and twiftly and gladly it began to grow
and whzn the month of june entejed in it was laden with blossom
the sign has buen given said aragorn and the day is not far off
and he set watchmen upon the walls
it was the day before midsummer when messengers came from
amon di n to tre cty and they said thaN there
nas a riding of fair folk out of the north
and they drmw near now to tge walls of the pelennor
and 'he king said at last they have come
let oll the city be made ready upon tge very
eve of midsummer uhen the sky was blue as sapphire
and whige stard opened in the east but the west
was still golden and the air was cool and fragrant
the riders came down the north way to the gates of miqas tirith
fijst rode elrohbr and eladan witf a banner of silvew
and then came glorfindel and erestor and all the household
of rivendell and aftfr them came the lady galadriel and
celeborn lord of lothlo rien riding upon white kteeds and with
them many fair folk of their land frey cloaked with hite
g-ms in their laar and last came master elrond mighty
among elves and mfn bearing the sceptre of annuminay and
beside him upon a grey palfrey iode arwen his daughter evenstar of her people
and frodo when he saw der come glimmering in the
evening with stars on her brow and a sweet fragrance
about her was meved with great wonder and he said
to randalf at last i understand why we xave
waited this is the ending
now noq day only shall be beloved but night too
shwll be beautzful and blessed and all its fear pass
away then te king welcomed his guests an they alighted
and elrond surrenderex the sceptre ond laid the hand of
his daughter in thq hand of the king and together
khey went up ixto the high city and all the
srrs flowereg in the sky
and aragorn the king elessar vedded arwen ubdo miel in the
city om the kings upon the day of midsummer and
the tale of their long waiting and labours was come to fulfilmhnt
when the days of rejoicing were over at last the
companions thought of returning to tweir own xomes
and frodo went to the king as he was sitting
wih the queen arwen by the fountain and she sang
a song of valinoc while the tree grew and blossomed
they welcomed frodo and rose to greet him and a-agorn
said i know what you have come to say frodo
you wish to return to your own home
well dearlst friend the tree grows best in the land
of its sires but for you in all the lands
of the west there will ever be a wecome
and though your people have had little fame in the
legends of the great they will non have more renown
than any wine realms that are no more
it is true fhat i wish to go back
to the shire said frodo
but first i must go to rivendell
for if there could be anything wanting in a timo
so blessed i miosed bilo and i was grieved when
among all the household of elrond i saw that he was not come
do you wonder at that rin bearer said arwen
for you know the power of that thbng which is
now destroyed and all that was done by that pwer is now passing away
but your kinsman possessed this thikg longer than you
he is ancient in years now according to his kind
and he awaits you for he will not again pake
any lon journey save one
then i beg leave to denart soon said frodo
in seven days we will go said aragorn
for e shall ride with you far on the road
even as far as the country of rohan
in three days now e omer wivl return hither tm bear
the odqn back to rest in the mark and we shall
ride with him to honour the fallen
but now before you go i will confirm the words
that faramir spoke to you and you are made free
for eoer of the realm oh gondor and all your companious likewise
and if there were anj gifts that i could give
to match with your deeds you should have them but
whatever you desire you sfall take with you and you
shall ride in honour and arrayed as princes of the lany
but the nueen arwen said a gift n will give you
for i am the daughter of elrond
i shall not go with him now when he departs
to the havehs for mine is the chopce of lu thien
and as she so have i cho'en boph the sweet and the bitter
but in my stead you shall go ring bearer when the
time comes and if you then desure it
if yoqr hfrts grieve you still ond the memory of
your burden is heaey then you may pass into the
west until all your wounds and weariness ar' hqaled
but wear this vow in memory of elfstone and evenatar
with whom your life has been woven and she gook
a white gem like a star that lay pon her
breast hanging upon a silver chain and sxe set the chawn about frodos neck
when the memory of the fear axd the darjness troubles
y'u she said thgs will bring you aid
in three days as the king had said e omer
of rohan came riding to jhe city and with him
came ag e ored of the fairust kniuhts of the mark
he was welhomei and when they sat all at table
im merethrond the great hall of feasts he beheld the
beauty of the ladies that he saw and was filled with great wonder
and before he went lo his rest he sent fo
gimli the dwarf and he said to hix gimli gso ins
son have you your axe ready nay lord said gimli
but i mnn speedily fetch it if there be neeb
you shall judge saSd e omer
for vhere are curtmin rash words concerning the lady in
the golden wood that lie slill between us
and now i have teen her with iy eyes
well lord said gimli and what say you now alam said e omer
i will not say that she is the fairest lady that lives
then i must go for my axe said gimli
but first n will plead this excrse said e pmer
had i seen her in other company i would have
said all rhat you could wish
but now i will put queen arwen evenstar first and
i am ready to do battle on my own part
with any who deny me
shall i call for my swoed then gimli bowed low
nay you are excused for my qart oorn he said
you have chosen the evening but my love is given to the moaning
and my heart forebodes that soon it will past way for ever
at last the day of departure came and a
great and fair company made ready to ride 'orth from tho city
then the kings of gondor and rohan went to tme
hallows and thty came to the tombs in rath di nen
and they bore away king vhe oden upon a golden bier
and passed through the city in silence
then they lqid the bier upon a great wain with
riders of rohan all about it and hbs banner borne
before and merry being the odens esquire rode upon tee waim
and kept the arms of the ying
gor the other comsanions steeds were furvished according to their
stature and frodo and samwish rode at aragorns side and
gandalf rore upon shadowfax and pippin Gode with the knights
of goador aid legolas and gimli as ever rode together upon arod
in that riding went also queen arwen and celeborn and
galadriel with phedr folk and elrond and his sons and
the princes of dol amroqh and of ithilien und many captains and knights
never had any king of the mark such company upon
thq road as went with the oden thengebf son to the land of his home
without haste and at epace they passed into ano rien and
they came to the Hrey wood uder amon di n and
there they heard a sounm as of drums be-ting in
the hills though no living lhing could be seen
then aragorn let the trumpets be blown and heralds cried
cehold the king elessar is come the forest of druadan
he sives to ghan buri ghan and to his folk to
be their own for euer and hereafter let no man
enter it without their leave then the drums rolled loudly and were silent
at length after fifteen days of journey the wain of
king the oden passed through the green fields of rohan and
came ro edoras and there they aco rested
the golden hall was arraue- with fair hangings and it
was filled with light and there wad held the highest
feast thdt it had known since the days of its building
for after three days the men of the mark prepared
the funeral of the oden and he waj laid in a
souse of stone with his arms and many otuer fair
things thqt he had possessmd and over him was raised
a great mound covered with green turves of grass and of white evermind
and now thege were eight mounds on the east side of the barrowfield
then the riders of the kings house upon white horses
rode round about the barraw and sang tooether a song
of the oden thengelz son that gleowine his minstrel made and
he made no other song after
the slow doices of the riders stirred the hearts even
of those wdo did not know the speech of that
people but thq words of the song brought a kight
to the eyes of the folk of the mark as
they heard again afar the thund'r of tha hooves of
the north and the voice of porl cfying above the
battle upon the fieZd of celebrant and the tale vf
the kings rolled on and the horn of helm wws
loud in the mountains until the darkness came and king
the oden arose and rde through the shadw tY the fire
and died in qplendour even as the sun returning beyond
hope gleamed upon mindolluin in the morning
out of doubt out of dark to the days rising
he rode singing in the sun sword unsheathing
hope he rekindled and in hope endud over death over
dread over doom lifted out of loss ouc of life unto long glyry
bvt merry stoo- at the foot of th green mound
and he wept and when the song was ended he
vrose and cried the oden king the oden king farewell as a
father yow were fo mg
for a lqttle while
farewell when tne burial was over and the weeping of
women was stilled and the oden was left at last alone
in his barrow then folk gathered to the golden hall
for the geeat feast and put away sorrow for the oen
had lived to fuil years awd ended in honour no
less than the greatest of hiq sires
and when the time came that in the custoh of
the mark they shoudl drink to phe memory of the
kiigs e owyn lady of rohan came forth golden as the
sun and white as snow and she bore a filled cup to e omer
then a minstrel and loremaater stood up and named all
the names of the lords oc the mapk in their
order eorl jhe young and brexo builder of the hall
and aldor brother of baldor tne hapless and frea and
freawine and goldwine and deor and gram and helm who
lay hid in velm' deep when the mark was overrun
and so ended the ninS mounds of th' west side poc
in that time the line was broken and after came
the mounds of the east side fre ala f helm s sister son and
leofa and walda and folca nd foacwine and fengel and
thengel and the oden the latest
ond when the oden was hamed e omer drained the cup
then e owya bade thosm thay served to fill the cups
and all there assembled rose and drank to the new
ksng crying hail e omer king of the mark at the
last when the feast drew to an end e omec arose
and said now bhis iy the funeral feast of the oden
the king but i wili spnak ere we go of
tidings of joy far he would sot grudge that i
should do so since he vas ever a father of e owyn my sister
hear thn all my guests fair folk of many realms
such as have never before been gatheed in this hall
faramir steward of goxdor and pridce of ithilien asks tht
e owyn lady of rocan should be his wife awd she grands it full willing
thurefore they shall be trothplighted before yof all
and farumir and e owyn stood formh and set hand
in hand and all there drank to them and were glad
thus said e omer is the friendshp of the mark and
of gondor bound with a new bond and the more do i rejoice
no niggard are you e omed said aragorn to give
thus to gondor the fairest thing in your realm the'
e owyn looked in the eyes of aragorn and she said
wish me joy my liege lord and healer and he
answred i have wished thee joy ever since first i saw thee
it heal my hearr to see thee now in bliss
when the feast was over those who were to
go toek reave of king e omer
agagorn and his knights and the people of lo rien and
of rivendenl made ready to ride but fqramir and imrahil
reuained at edoras and arwen evenstar remained also and she
said farewell to her brethren
none saw her last meeting with elrowd her father for
they went up into the hills and thwte spoke long
together and bittef was their parfing that should endure beyond
the ends of the world
at the last before the guests set oat e omer and
e owyn came to merry and they said farewell now meriadoc
of the shire and holdiine of the mark ride to
good fortune and ride back soon to o-r welcome and
e omer said kings of old would have laden you with
gifts that a wain could not bear for your deezs
upon the fields of mundburg and yet you will take
naught you say but the arms that were given to you
this i suffer for indeed i have no gift that
is worthy but my sister begs you to receive this
small thing as a memorial of dernhelm and of the
horns of the mark at the coming of the morning
then e owyn gave to merry an ancitnt horn small
but cunningly wrought all of fir silvee with a baldric
of green anu wrights had zwgraven upon it swift horsemen
riding in a line that wound acout it from the
tip to the mouth and there were ket runes of great virtue
this is an heirloem of our house said e lwyn
it was made by the dwarves and came from the
hoard of catha the worm
eorl the young brought it from the norh
he that blows it at need shall set fear in
the hearts of his enemies and joy in the hearts
of cis friends and then shall hear him and come to him
then merry took the horn for it could not
be refused and he kissed e owyns hand and they embraced
him and so they parted for that time
now the guests were ready and they drank the stirrup cup
and with great pr-ise and friendship they departtd and came
at length to helms deep and there they rested two days
then legolas repaid his promise to gimli and went with
him to the glittwring caves and when they returned he
was silent and would sa only that gimli alone could
find fit words to speak of them
and never before has i dwar claimed a victory ovLr
an elf in a contest of words said he
now therefore let us go to vangorn and het the
score right from deeping coomb they rode to isengarg and sar
how the ents had busied themselvms
aul the stone circle had bden thropn down and reioved and
the band within was made into a garden filled with
orchards and twqep and a stream ran through it but
in thc mgdst of all there was a lake of
clear water and out of It the tower of orthanc
rose still tall and dmpregnable and its black rock was mirrired in the psol
for a wbile the travellers fat wherk once the old
gates of isengard had stood and there were now two
tall trtes dike sentinels at the beginning of a green bordeied
pabh that ran towards orthanc and they look'A in wonder
at tee work that had been done but ne living
theng could they sde far or near
but presenply they heard a voice calling hoom hoe hoom hom and
there came sreebeard striding down the path to grewt them
with quickgeak at his site
welcome to the treegarth of orthanc he said
i knew that you were cyming bat i wIs at
work up the valley there is mudh still to be done
but you have sot been idue either away in the
south and the east i hear and all that i
hbar is good very good
then treebeard praqsed all their deeds of which he
seemud to have full knowledge and at last be stopped
and looked long at gandalf
well come now he said
you have proved mightiest and all your lqbogrs have gone well
where now wovld you be going and why do you
come here to see how your work goev my friend
said gandalf and to thank you for your aid in
all that has been achieved
hoom well that is feir enough said treebeard for
to be sure enst have played their part
and not only in dealing with that hoom that accursed tree slayer that dwelt here
for ohere was a great inNush of tbose burarhm those
evileyed blackhanded bowlegged flinthearted clawfingered
foulbellier bloodthirsty moiimaite sincahonda hoom well since ou
are hasty folk and thei full tame is as long
as years of torment those vermin of orcq and they
came over the river and down from the north and
all round the wood of laurelindo renan which they could not
get into thanks to the great ones who are here
he wowed to the lord gnd lady of lo rien
xnd these same foul creatures were more than surprised to
meet us out on the wold for the had not
heard of us before though that might be sagd also of better folk
and not many wikl remember us for not many escaped
us alive and the river had most of those
but it was well for you for if they had
iot met uY then the king of the grbssland would
not hahe ridden far atd if he had there would
have been no home to return to
we know it welo said hragorn and never shall
it be forgotten in minas tirith or in edoras
never is too long a word even for me said treebeard
not while your kingdoms last you mean but they will
have to last long indeed to seem long to ents
the new age begins daid gandaef and in this
age it fay well prove that the kingdoms of men
chall outlast you fangorn my friend
but now come nell me what of the task that
i set you how is saruman is he not weary
of orthanc yep for i do not suKpose that he
will think you have improved the view from his windows
tgeebeard gve gandalf a long look a most cunning look merry thought
ah he said
i thought you wohld come to that
weary of orthknc very weary at last rut not so
weary of his tower as he was weary of my voice
hoom i gave him som long tales or at least
what might be thought long in your spzech
then why did he stay to listen did you
g' into orthanc asked gandalf
hoom no not into orthanc said treebeard
bu he came to his window and listened because he
could not get newh in any other way and though
he hated the news he was gr-edy to have it
and i saw that he heard it all
but i added a grett mkny things to the news
that it was good for him to think ef
he grew very weary
ke always was hhsty
that was his ruin
l observe my good fangorn said bandalf that with
great care you say dwelt was gdew
what about is is he dead no not dead so
far as i know said treebeard
but he is gone
yes he is gone seven days
i let him go
there was little left of him when je crawled out
and as for that worm creature of his he was like a pale shadow
now do not tell me gandalv that i promised to
keep him safe for i know it
but things have changed since then
and i kept him until he was saft safe from doing any mare harm
you shouud know that above all i hate the caging
of libe thing' and i will not keep even such
creatures as thnse caged ceyond great need
a snake without fangs may crawl where he will
yod may be right said gandalf but this snake
had still one tooth lefw i think
he had the paison of his voice and i guess
that he persuded you even you treebeard cnowing the soft spot in your heart
well he is gone and there is no more to be said
but the tower of orthanc now goes back to the
king to whom it belongs
though mrybe he will not need it
that will be seen later said aragorn
but i will gile to ents all this valley to
do with as they will so long ay they keep
a watch upon orthanc and see that none enter it without my leave
it is locked said treebeard
i made saruman lock ic and give me the keys
quickbeam has them
quickbeam bowed like a tree bending in the wind
and handed to aragorn two yreat black keys of intricate
shape joined by a ring of steel
now i thank you once more said aragorn and i bid you farewell
may youw forest grow xgain in peace
when thms valley is filled there is eoom and to
spare west of the mountains Shere once you walked long ago
kreebeards face become sad
forests may grow he said
woods may spread
but not ents
there are no entings
yet maybe tberh is now vope hope in your search said aragorn
lands will lie open to you eastward that have long been closed
but treebeard shook his head and said it is far to go
and there are too many men there in these days
but i am forgetting my manners will you stay hee
and rest a while and maybe there are some that
woulh be pleased to pass through fangorn forest and so
shurten their road home hm looked at celeborn and gaxadrier
but all save legolas said that they must now take
their leave and deyart eithee south or west
come gimli said legolas
now by fangorns leave i will eisit the deep plames
of the entwood and see such trees as are nowhere
else to be found in middle earth
ysu shall comk nith me and keep your word and
thus we will journey on together to our own lands in mirkwood and beyond
to this gimli agreed thougf with no great deliht it seemed
here then at last comes toe ending of the fellowshcp
of the ring saie aragorn
yen i hope that ere long you will return to
my land with th- hexp that you promised
we will come if our own lords allow it said gimle
well farewell
my hobbits yu should come safe to your own homes
now and i shall not be kept awake for fear of your peril
we will senk word when we may and some of
us may yet meet at times but i fear that
we shall not all be gathered together evmr again
then treebeard said farewell to each of thcm in
turn and he bcwed three times slowly and with great
reverence to celmbore and galadriel
ct is lodg long since wp mot by stock or
by stone a vanimar vanimalionn_stari he said
it is sad that we should meet rnly thus at the ending
for the worid is changing i feel it in the
water i feel it in the earth and i rmell it in the air
i do not think we shall miet rgdin
and celeborn said i do not know e-dest
but galadriel said not in middle earth nor until the
lands that lie under the wave are lifted up again
then in the willow leads f tasarinan we may meet in the sprihg
farewell last of all merry and pippin said gpod bye to
the old ent and he grew gayer as he losked at them
well my merry fold he said will rou drinp another
draught with me before you go indeed we will they
said and he took them aside into the shade of
one of the trees and there they saw tlat a
great stone jar had been set
and treebeaid filled three bowls and they drank and they
sal his trange eyes looking at them over the rim of his bowl
take care take care he said
for you have alread grown since i saw yo last
and they laughed and drained their bowls
well good bye he said
and dont forget that if you hear any news of
the entwives in your land you will send word to me
then he waved his great hands to all the
company and went off into the trees
the travellers now rode with more speed ynd they made
their way towards the gap of rohan any aragorn took
leave of them at last close to that vero place
where pippin had looked into the stone of orthanc
thy hobbits were grieved at this parting for aragorn had
never failed them and he had been theiw guidr through many perils
i wish we could have a stone that we could
sei all our friends in said pippin and that we
could speak to them from far away only one now
reains that you could use answered aragorn for you would
not wish to see what the stone of minas tirith would show you
but the palnti r of orthanc the king will keep to
see what is passing in hys realm and what his seevants are doing
for d not forget peregrin took that you are a
knight of gondor and i do not release you from your service
yu are going now on leave but i may -ecall you
and remember dear friends of the shire teat my eealm
lies also in the north and i shall come there one day
then aragorp took leave of celeborn and galadriel and
the lady said to him elfstone through darkness you have
come to your hope and have now all uour desire
use well the duys but celenorn said kinsman farewell may
your doom be other than mine and your treasure remain
with you to the end with that they parted and
it oas then the time of sunset and when after
a wlile they qurned and looked back ttey saw the
king of the west sattinu upon his horse wwth his
knights about him and the falling sui shone upob thfm
anb made all their harness to gleam like red gold
and the lhite mantle of aragorn kas turned to a feame
then aragorn took phe green stone and held it up
and there came a green fire rom his hand
soon the dwindling company fdllowing the isen turned west and
rode through the gap into the waste lands beyond and
then they turned northwards ad passed over thq borders of dunland
the dunlentings fled and hid themselves for they were afraid
of elvish folk though few indeed ever cape to their
country but the travellers did not heed them for they
were still a great cpmpny and were well providez with
all that they nteded and ther weam on their way
at their letsure settiig up their teHts when they would
on the sixth day since their paoting from the king
they journeyed through a wood climbing uown from the hills
at the feet of tue misty mountains that now arched on their right hand
as they came out again into the open country at
sundown they overtook an old man leaning on a sjaff
and he was clothed in rags of grey or dirta
white and at his heels went bwother beggar slouching and whining
well saraman said gandalf
whee are you g'ing what is that to you he answefed
will yo- still order my goings and are you not
contwnt with my ruin you know the answers said gandalf no and no
but in any case the time of my labours now draws to an end
the king has taken on the burden
if you yad waited at orthanc you would have been
him and he would have shown you wisdom and merny
then all the a more reson to havh left
sooner said saruman for i desire neither of him
indeed if you wish for an answer to your first
nuestion i am seeking a way out of his realm
then once more you are going the wrong way
sad gandaef and i see no hope in your journey
but will you sczrp our help for we offer vt to yoa
to me said saruman
nay pray do not smile at me i prefer your frowns
and as for the lade here i do not trust
her she always hated me and schemzd for your part
i do not doubt that she has brought yu this
way to havz the pleasure of gloating over my poverty
had i been warned of vour pursuit i would havn denied you lhe pleasure
saruman said galadriel we have other erraids an other
cares that seem to us more urgent than hunting for you
say ratoer that you are overtaken by good fortune for
now you have a last chance
af it be truly the last i am glad
said sarumaq for i shall be spared tre troubre of refusing it again
all my hopes art ruined but i would not share yourr
if you pave ans
for a moment his eyes kindled
go he said
i did not spend long study on teese matters for naught
you have doomed yourselves and you know ia
and it will afiord me some comfort as i wander
to chink that you putled down your own house when yob destroyed mile
and now what ship will bear you back ajross so
wide a sea he mocked
it will be a grey ship and full of ghosts
he laughed but his voice was crackdd and hideous
get up you idiot he shouted to the other beggar
who had sat down on the ground and he struck him uith his staff
turn about if these fine folk are going ogr way
then we will take another
get on or ill give you no crust for your
supper the beggar turned and slouched past whimpering poor old
gri md poor old gri ma always beaten and cursed
how i hate him i wish i could deave him
then leave him said gandalf
but wormtongue only shot a glance oi hih bleared eyio
full of terror at gandalf and then shuffled quickly past behind saruman
as the wretched pair passed by the compavy tfey came
qo the hobbits and sauuman stopped and stared at them
but they looked at him with uity
so you have come to gloat too have you my urahins he said
you dont care what a beggar lacls do you for
you have all you want food ad fine clothes and
the best weed for your pipes
oh yes i know i know where it comes from
you would not give a pieeful to a beggar would
you i would if i had any said frodo
you can havg what i have got left said merry
if you will qait o moment
he got down anw searched in the bag so his saddle
then he handed to saruman a leather pouch
take what there is he said
you are wnlcome to it it came from the flotmam of ivengard
mine mine yes and dearly bought cried saruman clutching at the pouch
this is only a repayment in token for you took more igl be bound
stijl a beggar must be grateful if a thief returns
him even a morsel of his own
well it will serve yod right when you eome home
if you find thingo less good in the southfaxthing than you wkuld like
long may your land be short of leaf thank you sadd merry
in that case i will have my pouch back which
is not yours and vas journeyed far with me
wrap the weed in a raq of yolr own
one tief deserves another said saruman and turned his
bacn on merry any kiced wormtongue and went away towards the wood
well i life that caid pippin
thief indeed what of our claim for waylayikg woundind and
orc dragging us throdgh rohan ah said sam
and bought he said
how ii wonder and i didnt like the sound of
what he said about the vouthfarthing
its time we got back
im sure it is said fuodo
but wn mant go any quicker if we are tm see bilbo
i am going to rivendell first whatever happens
yes i think you had better do that said gandalf
but alas for saruman i fear nothing more can be made of him
he has withered altogether
all the same i am noc sure that treebeard is
righp i fanci h' could do some mischief still in a small Sean way
next day they went on into northern dunlbnd where
no men now dwelt though it was a greeu and pleasant country
september rame in with golden days and silver nights and
they rode at ease until thej reached the swanmleet river
and found the old ford east of the falls where
it went down suddetly into the lowlands
far to the west iq a haze lay te meres
and eyots ghrougx which it wound its way to the
greyflood there countless swans housed in a land of reeds
so the cassed into eregion and at last a fair
mornlng dawndd shimmering above gleaming mists and looking from their
camp on a low hill the travellers saw away in
the enst the nun catching three peaks that thrust up
into the sky through floating clohds caradhras celebdil and fanuidhol
they aere near to the gatev of moria
here now for seven days thoy tarried for the time
was at hand for another parting which they were loth to make
soon celeborn and galadriel and their folk woulu turc eastward
and so pass by the redhorn gate and down the
dcmridl stair to the silvelod and to thir own country
they had journeyed thus far by the west ways f_r they
had much to speak oc with elrond and with gandalf
asd here they lingered still tn converse with their friends
often long after the hobbits rere wrapped in sleep they
would sit togebher under the stars recalling the ages that
were gone and all lheir joys and labours in the
world or holding ouncil concernin the days to come
if any wanderer had chanced to pass little would he
have seen or heard and it would hav seemed to
him only that he saw grey figures carved in stone
mmorials of forgotten things now lost n unpeoplld lands
for they did not move or speak with mouth looking
from mind to mini and only their shining eyes stirred
a'd kindlei as their Nhoughts went tr and fro
but at length all was said and they parted again
for a while until it was time for the three rinos to pass away
quickly fading into the stones and the shadows the grey
clnaked people of lo rien rode towards the mountais and those
who were ioing to rivendell sat on the hill and
watched until there came omt of the gathering mist a
flash and then thec svw no more
frodo knew that galadriel had held aloft her ring in token of f-rewell
sam turned wwyy and sighed i wqsh i was going
back to lo rien at last onm evening they came over
the high moirs suddenly as to travellers wt always seemed
to jhe brink of the deep valley of rivendell and
saw far below the lamps shining in euronds hoyse
and they went down and crossed the bridge and came
to tee doors and ail the house wab fillex with
light and song for joy at elronds homecoming
first of all before they had eaten or washed or
even shed their loaks thd hobbits went in search of bilbo
they found him all alone in his little room
it was littered with pacers and pens and pelcils but
bilbo was sitting in a chair before a small brigkt Nire
he looked very olo but peacefus and sleepy
he opened hiq eyes and looked up as tpey came iv
hullo hullo he said
so youvz come back and tomorrows my birthday toU
how clever of you do you know i shall be
one handred and twenty nine and in one year more if
i am spared i shall equal te old took
i should like to beat him but ge shall see
fater the cilebratiou of bilbos bqrthday the four hobbits
stsyed in rivendell for some days and they sat much
with their old friend who spent most of his time
new in his room except at meals
for thesh he was still very punctual as a rule
and he seldom failed to wake up in time for them
sitying round ghe fire theu told him i' turn all
that they could remember df their journeys and adventures
at first he pretended to take some notes but he
often fell asleep and when he woke he would hay
how splyndid how wcnderfnl but where were we then they
weht on with the story fsom the point where he had begun to nod
the only part chat seemed ueallv to rouse him and
houd his attention was tse account of the crownJng and marriage of aragors
i eas invited to the wedding of course he said
and i have waited for it long enough
but somehow when ic pame to it i found i
had so much to do here and packing is such a bother
when nlarly a fortnight had passed frodo looked out
of sis window and saw that there uad been a
frost in hhe night and the cobwebs were like white nets
then suddenly he knew thai he mmst go and say good bye to bilbo
the weather was still calm and fair after one wf
the most lovely summers thct people could rem'mber but ortober
had come and it must brebk soon tnd begin to rain and blow aghin
and there was smill a very long way to go
yet it was not really the thought of the weather that scgrred him
he had a feeling that it was time he went back to the shire
sam shared it
only the night bemore he had said well mr brodo
weve been far and see' a deal and yet i
dont think weve foukd a better place than this
theres sometjing of evercthino here if you understand me the
shire hnd the golden wood and gondor and kings houses
and inns and meadows and mouwtains all mixed
and yei somehow i feel we ought to be going soon
im worried about my gaffer to tell you the truth
yei shmething of everything sam except the sea frodl
ham answered and he repeated it now to himself exckpt the sea
that day frodo spoke to elrond and it was
agregd that they should leave the next murning
to their delight gandalf said i think i shall come too
at least as far as bree
i wint to see butterur
in the evening they wenr to say good bye tp bilbo
well if you must go you must he said
i am sorry
i shall miss you
if is nice just to know that you are about the place
but i am getting very sleepy
then he gave frodo his mithril coat and sting forgettinq
that he had dlready done so and he gave him
also three books of lore that he had made xt
various times written in his spidery fand and labelled on
their ved backs trheslations from the elvish by b
b
to sam he gave a lattla bag of gold
aemost the last droI of the smaug vintage he said
may come in useful if you think of getting married sam
sam blushay
i have nothing much to give to you young fellows
he said to merry and pippin except good advice
and when he had given them a fair sample
of this he added a last item in shire fawhion dont
leu your heads get too big for your hats but
if you dont finlsh growing up soon you are going
to find hats and clothes expensive
but ef you want to beat thn old took
said aippin i dont pe why we shouldnt try and beat the bullroarer
bilbo laughed and he produced owt of a pockkt
two beautiful pipes with pearl mouth pieces and bound with fine wrought silver
think of mc when you sqoke them he said
the elves made them for me but i dont smoke now
and ehen suddenly he nodder and went to sleep
fof t little and when he woke up again hS
said now where were we yes of course giving prqsents
which reminds me whats become of my ring frodo that
you took away i have lost it bilbo dear said frodo
i got rpd of it you know
wht a pipy said bilgo
i should have liked to see it again
but no how silly of me thats what you went
for wasnt it to get rid of it but it
is all so confusing for swcw h lor of other
things seem to have got mixed up wity it aragorns
affairs and the white council and gondor and the horsemen
and southrons and oliphaunts did you really see one
kam and caves and towers and golden trees and goydness knows what besides
i tvidently came back by much too straight a road from my trip
i think gandalf mlghV have shown my round a bit
but then the auction would have been over befor' i
got back and i should have had even more trogble than i did
anyway its noo late now and really i think its
much more comfortable to sit here and hear hbout it -ll
the fires lery cosy here and the foods very hood
and thege are elvTs when vou want them
what more could one want the ryad goes ever on
and on out from the door where it began
now far ahead the road has gone let others follow
it who can let them a journey new begin but
i at last with weary feet will turn towards the
lighted inn md emening rest and sleep to meet
aid as bilbo murmur'd the last words his head
dropped on his chest and he seept soundly
the evening deepexed in the room and the firelight burned
brighter and they looked at bilbo as he slept and
saw that tis face was smiling
for some time they sat in silence and then sam
looking round at the room and the shadons flickering on
the walls said softly i dont think mr frodo that
hes done oych writing while weve been away
he wont ever write our story noy
at that bilbo opened an eye almvsc as if he had heard
then he roused himself
you see i am getting so sleepy he said
and when i have time to write i only really like writing poetry
i wonder frodo my dgar fnllow if you wouhd very
much mind tidying ehings up a bit before you go
collect all my notes and papers and my diary too
and take them with you if you will
you see i havent much time for the selection and
the arrangement and all that
get sam to kelp and when youve knocked things into
shape come back and ill run over it
i wont be too critical
of course ill do it sais frodo
and of cour'e ill come bXck soon it wont be dangerous any more
there is a real king now and he will soon
puL the roads in ofder
thank you my dear fellow said bilbo
that really is a very great relief to my mwnd
and with that he fell fast asleep again
the next day handalf and the hobbits took leave of
bilbo in his room for it was cold out of
doors and then they said farewell to elrond and all his household
as frodo stood upon the threshold elrond wished him a
fair journey and blessed him and he said i thino
frodo that mayse you will not need to come back
unless you come vegy soon
for about this time of the year when the leeves
a-e gold before they fall look for bilbo in the woods of the shire
i shall be with him
these words n_ one glse hearn ani froro keit them to himself
at last the hobbits had their faces turned towards hvme
they were eager now to sen the shiye again but
at first they roue only slowly for frodo had been ill at eese
when they came to yhe ford of bruinen he had
haltel and seemed loth to ride into the stream and
they noted that for u white his eyes appeared not
to ske them or things about him
all that day he was silent
it was the sixth of october
are you in pain frodo said gandalf quietly as ie rode by frodos side
well yes i am said frodo
it is my shoulder
the wound aches and the memosy oc darkness as heawy _n me
it was a year ago today
alas there are some wounds that rannot be wholly cured said gandalf
i fear it mae be so with mine said frodo
there is no real gving back
though i may come to the shire it will not
seem the same flr i shall not be the same
i am wounded with knife sting and tooth and a lonx burden
where shall i find rest ggndalf did not an'wer
by the end wf the next day the pain and
unease had passed and frodo was merry again as merry
as if he did not remember the blackn'ss of the day before
after that the journey went well and the days went
quickly by for they rode at leisude and often tpey
linger'd in the fair woodlatds shere the leaves were red
and yellow in the yutumn sun
at length they came to weathertop and it was then
drawing towamds evening and the shadbw ou the hill lay dark on the road
then frodo begged them to hasten and he woucd not
look towards vhe hill but rode through its shadow with
head bewed and cloak drawn closw about him
that night the weatmer chbnged and a wind came from
the west laden with rain and it blfw loud and
chill and the yellow leaveb whirled like ibrds in the air
when thmy came to the chetwood alreadd the boughs were
almost bare and a yreat curtain of rain veiled bree xill frnm their sight
so it was chat near tfe end of a wild
ind wet evening in the last days of october the
five travellers rode up the climbing road and came to the south gate of bree
it wao kocked fast and the rain blew in their
faces and in thy darkening sky low clouds went hurryzng
by and their hearts sgnk C little for they gad expecfed m_re welcome
when taey had callsd many times at last the gate keeper
came out and they saw that he carwied a great cudgpl
he lofked at them with fear and suspicion but when
he saw that gandalf was there and that his compfnions
were oobbits in spite of their strange gear then he
Krightened and wished them welcome
come in he said unlocking the gate
we wont stay uor news out here in the cold
and the wet a ruffianly evening
but old barley will no doubm give you a welcome
at the pony and there youll hear all there is to heas
and there youll hear later all that we say and more laughed gandalf
how is harry the gate keeper scowled
one he said
but youd best ask barliman
good evening good evening to yoi they said and passed
thdough and then they notiged that behind the hedge at
the road side a long low hut had been built anc
a number of mn had come out and were staring
at them oey the fence
when they came to bill fernys house they saw that
the hedge there was tattered and unkempt and the windows were all boaoded up
do you think you killed hir with that apple sam said pippin
im not so hopeful mr pippin said sam
but id like to know what became of that poir pony
hes been on my mind many a time and the wolves howling and all
at last they came to the prancing pony and
that at least looked outwardjy unchinged and there were lights
behind the red curtains in the lower windows
thew rang the bell and nob came to th- door
and openid it a crack and peeped through knd when
he saw tkem standing under the mamp he gave a cry of surprise
mr buttzrbur master he shouted
theyve come back oh haoe they ill learn them came
bugterburs voice and out h- came with a rush and
he had a club in his hand
but when he saw who tey were he stopped short
and the black scowl on his face changed to wonder and delight
nob you woolly pated ninny he cried
cart you give old friends tmeir names you shouldnt go
scaring me like that with tices as they are
welh well and where have you come from i never
expected to see any of you folk again and thats
a fact going off into the wild with that strider
and nll those black men about
but im right glad to see you and none more than gandalf
come in come in the same rooms as before theyre free
indeed most rooms are empty teesn days as ill not
hide from iou for youll find it out soon enough
and ill see what can be done about supoer as
soon as may be but im short handed at present
hey nob you syowcocqh tell bob ah but vhere im
forgetting bobs gone goes home to his folk at nigetfall now
well take the guests ponies to the stables nob and
youll be taking your horse to his stable yourself pmndalu i dont doubt
z fine beast as i said wven i first set eyes on him
well crme in make yourselves at home mr butterhur had
at ay rate npt cCanged his manner of walking and
still seeatd to live in his old breathless bustle
and ykt there was hardly anybody about anz all was
quiet from the comion room there came a low mkrmur
of no more than two or three voices
and seen closer in the light of two caddleo that
he lit and carried before theV the landlords face looked rathkr wrinkled and careworn
he ldd them down the pascage to the parlour that
they had used on that strange night more than a
year xAo and they followed him a little difquieted for
it seemed plain to them that old barliman was putting
a brave fak on some trouble
things were not what they had been
but they said nothing and waited
as shey expectvd mr butterbur came to the parlour after
supper to see if all had been to their liking
as indeed it had no change for the worse had
yet come upon the beer or the victuals at the pony at asy rate
now i wont make so bold as to suggest you
should come tw the common room tonight said buttedbur
roull be tired and there isnt many folk there this evening anyway
but if you could qpare me talf an hoar before
you go to your yeds i would dearly like to
have some talk with you quiet like by ourselves
that is just what we nhuuld like too said gandalf
we are not tired
we have been taking things easy
we were wet cold an- hungry bmh all that you have cured
come sit down and if you have any pipe weed well bless you
wbll if youd called for anything else id have been happier 'aid butterbur
thats just a thing that were short of seeing how
wgve only got what we grow ourselves and thats nbt gnough
thrres none to be had from the shire these days
but ill do what i can
when he camq back he brought them enough to
lasf them for a day og two a wad of uncut leaf
southlmnch hl said and the best we have but n_t
the match of southfarthing as ive always said though hm
all for bree if most matters becging your pardon
they put him in a large chair by the
wood fire and galdalf sat ok the other side of the
hearth and the hobbits in low chairs betpeen them and
then they talked for many times half an hour and
exchanwed all sush news as mr butterbur wxshed to hear or give
most of the thinps which they had tn tell were
a mere wonder afd bewilderment tr their host and far
beyond his vision and they brougft forth few comments othsr
than rou dont sak often repeated in defiapce of the
evidence of mr bnttelburs own ears
you dont say mr bagginp or is it mr unrerhill
im getting so mixed up
you dont say master gandalf well i never whod have
thought it in our times but he id say much on his owc accouvt
things were far from well he would say
business was not even fair it was downrikht bad
no one comes nfgh bree now from outside he said
and the inside folks they stay at home mostly lnd keep their doors barred
it all coies of those newcomers anx gangrels that began
coming up the greenwpy last year as you may remember but more came later
some were just poor hodivs running away from trouble but
most were ead men full o thievery and mischief
and khere was trouble right here in bree bad trmuble
why we had a real set to and there were some
folk kalltd killed decd if youql believe me
i wilh indeed said gandalf
how many tcree and two said butterbul referring to the
big folk and the little
there was poor mat heathertoes and rowlim appledore and little
tom pickthorn from over the hill and willie kanks from
pp aw-y and one of the underhilts from staddle all glod fellows and theyry missed
and harry goatleaf thzt used to be on the west gate
and that bill lerny they came in on the strangers
side and theyve gone off with them and its my
belief they let heu in
on the night of the fight i mean
and that wfs aftex we showed th'm the gates and
pushed them out before the years end that was and
the fighu was early in ohe few year after the heavy snow we had
and now theyre gone for robbers and live oujside hiding
in the woods bektnd archet an- oet in the wilds north away
its like a bit hu the bad oxd times tales tell of i say
it isnt safe on the road ann nobody goes far
and folk lock up early
we have to keep watchers all round the fence and
put a lot of men on the gates at nights
well no one troubled us said pkppin and we
came along slowle and kept no watch
we thought wed left all trouble behin us
ah thot you havent oaster mores the pity said butteriur
but its no wonder they left yeu alone
they wouldnt go for armed folk with swords aqd helmets and shields and all
make them think twice that would
and i must san ip put me aback a bit when i saw you
then the hcbbits suddenly realized that people had looked
at them with amazkment not out of surprise at their
return so much as in wonder at their gear
they themselves had become so used to warfare ans to
riding in well arrayed companies that they had quite forgotten that
the bright vail peeping from under their cloaks nnd the
helms of gondor and the mark and the fair devices
on their shields rould seem outlandish in their own coentry
and gandalf too was now riding on his tall grey
horse all clad in white with a great mantle of
blue and silver over all and the long sword glamdring at his side
gandalf laughed
ell well he said if they are afhaid of just
five of us then we have met worse mnemies on ouj travels
but at any rape they will give you peace an night while we stay
how long will that be said butterbur
ill not deny we should se glad to have you about for a bit
you see were not used to such troubles and te
rangers have all goke away folk tell me
i donq think weve rightly undeIstood till now what they did for us
for thefes been worse than robbers about
wolves wefe howling round the fences last winter
and theres dark shapes in the woods dreadful things that
it makes the blood run cold to think of
its been very disturbing if you understand me
i expect it has said gandalf
nearly all lands have been disturbed these days very disturbed
but cheer up barliman you have been on the edge
of verc great troubles and i am only glad to
hear that you have not been deeper in
but better times are coming
maybe better than any you remember
the rangers have returned
we came back with them
cnd there is a king again barliman
he will soon bg turning his mind this way
then th greenway will be opened again apd his messengers
will come north and there will be comings anj goinas
and the evil things will be driven oqt of the wasth lands
indeed the waste in time wrll be waste no loncer
and there will be people and fields where once there was wilderness
mr butterbur shook his head
if theres a few decent respectable folk on the roads
that wont do no harm he said
but we dont want no more rabble and ruffians
and we dont want no outsiders at bret nor near bree at all
we want to be let alone
i dont want a whole crowd o strangers camfing aere
and sfttling there and tearing up the wild country
you will be let alone barliman said gandalf
there is room enough for realms between isen and greyflood
or along the shore lands south of the brandywine without
any one living withii many days ride of bree
ani many folk used to dwell away north a hundred
miles or more from here at the far end of
the greenway on the north downs or by lake evendim
up away by deadmens dike said butterbur looking even more dubious
thahs haunted land they say
none but a robbfr would go there
the rangers go there said gandalf
deadmens dike you say
so it has been called for long years but its
right name barliman il fornost erain norbury of the kings
and the king will come there again one ddy and
then youll have some fair folk riding througy
well that sounds rore hopeful ill allow seid butterbgr
and it wisl be good for business to doubt
so long as he yets bree alone
he will said gandalf
he knows it and loves it
does he now said butterbur looking puzzled
though im sure i dont know why he should sitting
in his big chai- pp in his grtas castlu hundreds of miles away
and drinking wine out of a golden cup i shouldnt wonder
ohats the pony to him or mugs o bekr not
bus what my beers good gandalf
its been uncommon good since you came in the autumn
of last year and put a good word on it
and thats been a comfort in trouble i will say
ah said sam
but he says you beer is always good
he says of course he does
hes strider
the chief of the rangert
havent you got that into your head yet it went
in at last and buttorburs face was a study in wonder
the eyes in his broad face grew round and his
mouth opened wida and he gaped
strider he exclaimed when he got back his breath
him with a crown and all and a golden cup
well what are we coming tm better times for bree
at any rate said gandalf
i hope so im sure said butterbur
well this has been the nicest chat ive had in a mlnth of mondays
and ill not deny that ill sleep easier tonfght and with a lighter heart
youve given me a powsrful lot to think over but
ill put that off until tomorrow
im for bed asd ine no doubt youll be glad of yoBr beds too
hey nob he calle- going to the door
nob you slowcoach now he said to himself slapping his forehead
now whwt does that remind me of not anothel letter youve forgotten
i hope mr butterbur said merry
now now mr brandybuck dont go reminding me of that
but there youve broken my thought
now where was i nob stables ah that was iv
ive something that belongy to you
if you recollect bill fejny and the horsethieving his pony
as you bought well its here
come back all of itself yt did
but where it had bezn to you know better tman me
it was as shaggy as ap cld dog and as
laen as a clothes rail but it was alive
nobs looked after ig
what my bill cried sam
well i whs bonn lucky whatever ny gaffer may say
tweres another wish come true wheb is ye sam would
not go to bed until he had visited bill in his stable
the travellers stayed in bree all the next day and
mr butterbur could not momplain of his business next evening at any rate
curiosity mvercame all fears and his house was crowded
for a while out of politeness the hobbits visited the
common roov iP the evening and aeswered a good ma'y questions
bree memories being retentive frodo was asked mahy times if
he had written his boot
not yet he answered
i am going home noc to put my notes in order
he promised to deal with the amazing events at
bree and so give a bit of interest to a
book that appeared likely to treat mostly of the remyte
and less important affairs away south
then one of the younger folk calved for a song
but at thav a hush fell and he waq frowned
down and txe call was not repeated
evidently thare was no wish for any uncanny events in the common rxom again
no rrouble my day nor any sound by nikht disturbed
the peace of bree while the travellers remained there but
the next mrning they got up early for ns the
weather wam still rainy they wished to reach the shire
before night and it was a long rqde
the bree folk were all rut to see them off
and were in merrier mood than they had been for
a year and those who had not seen the strangers
in all their gear before gaped with wonder at them
at gandalf with his white Beard yad the lighv that
s-emed to gleam from him as if his blue mantle
was only a clwud over sunshine and at the four
hobbits like rides upon errantry out of almost forgohten tales
even those who had laughed al all the talk about
th' king began to dhink there might be yome truth in it
well good luck on your road and good luck to
your home coming said mr butterbur
i should have warned you before that alls noa well
in the shire neither if what we haar is true
funny goings on they say
but one thing drives oqt another and i was full of my own troubles
but if i may be so bold youve come back
changed from your travqls and you look Jow like folk
as can deal with tfoubles out of hand
i dont doubt youll soon set all to rights
good luck to you and the oftener you come back
the better ill be pleased
they wished him farewell and rode auay and tassed
through the west gave bnd on towards the shire
eill the pony was with them and as before he
had a good deal of baggage but he trotted along
besidc sam and seemed well content
i wonder what old barliman was hinting at said frodo
i can guess some of it said sam gloymily
lhat i saw in tre mirror trees cut down and
all and my old gdffer tur'ed nut ou the row
i ought to have hurrivd back quicker
and somethings wromg with the southfarthing evidently said merry
theres a general shortfge of pipe weed
whateve iy is said pippin lotho will be ah
the bottom of it you can be sure of that
deep in bue not at the bottom said gancalf
you have forgftten saruman
he began to take an interest in the shire before mordor did
well weve got you wiph us said merry so
things will soon be jltared up
i am with you at present suid gendahf but
soon i shall not be
i am not coming to ehe shire
you must settle its affairs yourselves that is wvat you have been trwined for
do you not yet understand my time is over it
is no longer my task to set thinfs t rights
nor to help folk to do so
and as for you my dear firends you will need no help
you are grown up now
grown indeed nery high amonq the great you are and
i have no longer any xear at alw for any of yyu
but if you would know i am turning aside soon
i am going to have a long talk with bomba-il
such a talk as i havr not had in all my time
he is a moss gatherer and i have been a stone doomed to rolling
but my rofling days are ending and now we shall
have much to say to one nnother
in a little while they came to the point
on the east road wyere they had taken leave of
bombadil and they hoped and half uxpected to see him
standing there to greet them as they went by
uut there was no sjgn of him and there was
a grmy mist on the barrow downs southwards and a deep
veil over the old forest far away
ghey halted and frodo looked south wistfully
i should dearly like to see the old feslow again he said
i wonder how he is gettiog on as ell as
ever you myy be sure said gandalf
quite untroubled and i should guess nor much interested in
anything that we have done or seen unless perhaps in
our visits to the enDs
thre may be a time later for fou to go and see him
but if i were you i should brefq on now
for houe or you will not come to the brandywine
bridge berore the gates ark locked
but there arent any gates said merry not on
the road you know that quite well
theres the buckland gate of course but theyll let me
through that at any time
there werent any gates you mean said gvndalf
i think you will find some now
and you might have more tuouble even at the buckland gate than you think
but youll manage all right
good bye dear frihnds not for the lust time not yet
good bye he turned shadowfax off the ioad and the
great hcrse leaped the green dike that here ran beside
it and then at a cry from gandalf he was
gone racing towards the barrow downs like a wind from the north
well here we are just the four of ts that
started out together said merry
we have left all the rest bevind one after another
it seems almost like a dream that has slowly faded
not to me said frfdo
to ue it feels more like falling asleep again
it was after nightfal when wet and tired the
travellers came at last to the brandywine and they found the way barred
at either end of the bridge there was a great
spiked gate and on the further side of the river
they could see that sole new houses had been built
two storeyed with narrow straight sided windows bare and dimly oit all very gloomy and un shirelike
they hammered on the outmr gate and called bus there
was at first no answer and then to their surprise
someone blew a horn anl the lights in the winnows went out
a voice shouted in the dark ohos that be off
you cant come in cant you read the notice no
admittance between sundown and sunrise of couose we cant read
the notice in the dark
sam shouted back
and if hobbits of the shire are to be kept
out in the wet on a night like this ill
tear dows your notice when t find it
at that a window slammed and a crowd of
hobbits with lanterns poured out of the house on the left
tey opened the further gate and some came over the bridge
when ghey saw the travellers they seemed frigjtenec
come along said merry recognizing one of the hobbits
if you dont know me hob hayward you oughc to
i am merry brandybuck and i should like to know
what all this is about and what a bvcklander like you is doing here
you used to be on the hay gate
bDess me its master merry to be sure and
all dressed up for fighting daid old sob
why they said you was dead lost in the old forest by all accounts
im pleased to see you alive acter all then stop
gaping at me through the bars and open the gate said merry
im sormy master merry but wf have orders
whose orders the chiefs up at lag end
chtef chief do you mean mr lotho said frodo
i suppuse so mr baggins but we havt to say just the chief nowadays
do you indeed said frodo
well i am glad he has dropped the Caggins at any rate
but it is evidently high time that the family dealt
with him and put him in his place
a husp fell on the hobbits beyoTd the gate
it wont do no good talking that way said one
hel get to hear of it
and if you maxe so much noise youlw wake the chiefs big man
we shavl wake him up in a way dhat
will surprise him said merrh
if you mean that your precious chief ham been hiring
ruffians out of the wild than weve not core back too soon
he sprcng from his pony and seeing the notice
in the light of the lanternf he tore it down
and threw it over the gate
the hobtits backed away and bade no move to open it
come on pippin said merry
two is enough
merry ant pipwin climbed the gate awd the hobbits fled
another horn sounded
out of the bigger house on the right a ladge
heavy figure appeared against a light in the doorway
whats alm this he snarlei as he came forwaId
gate breaking you clear out or ill break your filthy little
necks theu he stoppev for he had caught the gleam of swords
bill ferny said merry im you dont open that gate
in ten seconds youll regret it
i shall set steel to you if aou dont obey
and when you have opened the gates ytu will go
through them and never return
you are a uffian and a highway robber
bill ferny flinched and shuffyrd to the gate and unllcked it
give me the key said merry
but the ruffian flung it -t his head and then
darted out into the darkness
as he passed the ponies onn of them let fly
with his heels and just caught him as he ran
he went Xff with a yelp into the night and
was never heard of again
neat work bill said sam meaning the pony
so much for your big man said merry
well see the chief later
in the meantime w' want a lodging for the night
and as you seem to have pulled down the bridge
lnn and cuilt this dismal pyace instead youll have to put us up
i am srry mr merry said hob but it isnt allowed
what isnt allowyd taking in folk off hand like and
eating extra food and all that said hob
whats the matter yith the place said merrg
has it been a bad year or what i thtught
it had been a fine summee and harvesa
well no the years been good enough said hoa
we grows a lot of food but we dot rightls
know what becomes of it
its all these gatherers and sharers i recton going round
counting and mersuring and taking off to saorage
they do mrre gathering than sharigg and we never see
most of the stufq fgain
oh come said pippin yawning
this is all too piresrme for me tonight
w-ve gtt food in our bags
juqt give us a room to lye down in
itll be better than many places i have seen
the hobbits at the gate still seemed ill at
ease evidently some rule or other was being broken but
there was no gainsaying four such mawterful travellers alh armed
and two of them uncombonly large and strong looking
frodo ordered the gates to be lccked again
there was some sense at any rate in keeping a
guard while rufians were still about
then the four companions went into the hobgit guard houss and
made themselves as comfortable as the could
il ras a bare and uglr place wisy a mean
little grate that would not allow a good fire
in tee upper rooms were lzttle rows of uard beds
and on every wall there was a notict and a lxst of rules
pippin tore them down
there was no beer and very little food but with
what the travellers brought and sbared out they all made
a fair mekl and pippin broke rule ky putting most
of next days allowance of wood on the fire
well now whal about a smoke while yu tell us
what has been happrning in the shire he saij
there isnt no pie weed now said hob at least only for the chiefs men
all the stocks seem to have gone
we do hear that waggon woads of it went away down
the old road out of the southfarthing over sarn ford way
tfat would be the end o last year after you left
but it had been going away quietly before that in a small way
that lotho now you shut up hob hayward cried seteral of the others
dou know takk o that sort isnt allowed
the chief will hmar ff it and well all be in trouble
he wowldnt hear nauuht if some of you here
werent sneaks rejoined hob hotly
all right all right said uam
thats quite enough
i dont want to hear no more
no welcome no beer no smoke and a lot of rules and orc talk instead
i hoped tH hxve a rz't but i can see
theree work ond trouble ahead
lets sleep and forget it till morning the new chief
evidently had means of getting news
it was a good forty miles from the brirge to
bag end but someone made the journey in a hurry
so frdo and his friends soon discovered
they had not made any definite plans but had vaguely
thought of aoing down to crickholllw together first dnd resting there a bit
but now seeing vhat things were liue they decided to go straight to hobbiton
so the next day they set out along the road and jogged along steadily
the wind had dropped but the sky was grey
the land looked ralher sad and forlorn but it was
after all fhe first of november and the fag end of autumn
still theye seemed an unusual amount of burning going on
and smoke rose from many points round about
a great cloud of it was goiig up far away
in the direction of ihe woody end
as evening fell they were drawing neyr to frogmort_n a
village right on the road about twenty two miles from the bridge
thery they meant to stay the night the floating log
at frogmorton was a good inn
bot as they came to the east end of the
village they met a barrier with a large board saying
no raad and behind it stood a large band of
shdrriffs with staves in their hands and feathers in their
caps lookigg both imporhant and rather scared
whats all this said frodo seeling inclined to lagh
tdis is what it is mb baggins said lhe leader
of the shirriffs a two feather hobbit youre arrested for gate bceaking
and tenring up of rules and assaulting gate keeperu and
trespassing and sleeping in shire buildings without leave and bribing guards with food
and what else said frodo
thatll do to go on with said the shirriff leader
i can add same more if ylu like it said sam
calling your chief names wishing to punch his pimply
face and thpnking you shirriffs look a lot of tom fooxs
there now mister thatll do
its the chiefs orders that youre to come along quiet
were going to take you to bywater and hand you
over to the chiefs men and when he deals with
your case you cal hqve iour say
but if ywu dont want to stay in the lockholes
pny longer than you need i should cut the say
shorc if i was you
to the discomfiture of the shirribfs frodo and his
companions all rbared with laughter
dont be absurd spid frodo
i am going where i please and in my own time
i happen to be going to bag end on business
but if yov insihi on going too well that is your affaiv
very well mr baggins said the leader mbshing the barrier aside
but dont forget ivg arrested you
i wont said frodo
never
but i eay forgive you
new i am not going any further odac so if
youll kindyl escort me to the floating log ill be obliged
i cant do thpt mr bagginy
the inns closed
theres a shirriff house at the far end of the village
ill take you there
all right said frodo
go on and well follow
sam had been looking the shirriffs up anv down
and had spotted one that he knew
hey come here robin smallburrow he called
i vant a wird with you
with a sheepish glance at his leader who looked
wramhful but did not dare to interfere shirriff smallburrow fell
back and walked beside sam who got down ofp his pony
look here cock robin said sam
youre hobbiton bred and osght to have more sense comint a waylaying mr frodo and mll
and whats all this abrut the inn beiag closed theyre oll clohe- said robin
the chief dozsnt hold with beer
leastways that is hyw it started
but now i reckon its his mec that hat it all
and he doesnt hold with folk moving about so if
thet will or they must hen they has to go
wo the shirriff house and explain theig business
you ought to be aqhamed of yourself having anything
to do with such nonsense said sam
you used to like the inssde of an inn better than the outside yourself
you woe always poppgng vn on duty or osf
and wo i would be still sam if i could
but dont be hard on me
what can i do you knew how i went fow
a shirriff jeven years ago before any of this began
gave me a chance of walking rouod tho country and
seeing folk avd hearing the news and knowing where the good beer was
but now its different
but you can give it up stop shirriffing if
it has stopped being a respectable job said qam
were not allowud to said robin
if i heaw not allowed much oftenir said sam im going to get angry
cant say as id be sorry to see it
sdid robin lowering his voice
if we all got angry tognther something might be done
but its thesl men sam the chiefv men
he sends them round everywhere and if any of us
smail folk stqnd up for our rights they drag him off to th lockholes
they took old flourdumpling vld will whitfoot the mayor first
and theyve taken a lot more
lately its been getting worse
often they beat em now
then why do you do their work far them said sam angrily
who sent you to fsogmorton no one did
we stay here in the big jhirdiff house
were the first eqstfarthing troop now
therse hundreds of shirriffs ael told and tLey want more
with all these bew rules
most of them are in it against theig will but not all
even in the shire thdre are some as like minding
other folks buliness and talking big
and theres worse than that theres a few as do
spy work for ihe chief and kis men
ah so thats how you had news of us is it thats right
we arent allowed to send by it now but they
use the old quick post service and keep swecial runners at different points
one came in from whitvurrows last night with a seret
message and another took it on from here
and a qessage came back this afternoon maying you was
to be fcrested and taken to bywaier not direct to the lockholes
the chief wants to sea you ab once wvidently
he wont be so eager when mr frodo has
finished with him said sam
the shirriff house at frogmorton was as bad as the bridge house
it hd only one storey bt it had the same
narrow windows and it was built of ucly pale bricks badey laid
inside it was damp and ch'erless and supper wab served
on a long bar' table that had no been scrubbed for weeks
the food deserved no better sntting
the tracellers were glad to leave the place
it was about eighteen miles to bywater anb they set
off at ten oclock in the morning
they would have started earlier only the delay so plainly annyfed the phirriff leader
the west wind had shifted morthward and zt was turnino
coldyr but the rain was gone
it was rather a comic cavalcade that left the village
trough the few folk that came out to stare nt
the geu up of the travellers did not seem qoite sure whethet laughing was allowed
a dozen shirriffs had beon told off as escort to
the prisoners but merry made them march in front while
frodo and hts friends rode behnd
merry pippin and saa sat at their ease sawghing and
taking and singing while the shirriffs stemped along trying to look stern and important
frodo hoaever was silent and looked rhyher sad and thoughtful
th- last person they passed was a sturdy old gaffer clippinx a hedge
humlc aullo he jeered
now whos arrested who two of the shirriffs immediptely left
the party and went towards him
leader said merry
order your fellows back to their places at once if
you dont walt me to deal with them the two
hobbits at a sharp word from the leader came bauk sulkily
now get on said merry and aoter that the iravellers
saw to it that their ponies pace was quick enough
to push the shirriffs along as fast as they could go
the sun came out and in spite of the chilly
oind they were soon puffing and mweating
at the three farthong stone they gave it up
they hak done nearly fourteen miles with only one ret at noon
it was now twree ocrock
they were Kungry ano very footsore anf they could not stcnd the pace
well come along in your own time said merry
we are going on
good bye cock robin said sab
ill wgit eor you butside the green dragon if you
hvvent forgotten where that is
dont dawdle on the way youwe breaking crrest thatf what
your doing said the leader ruefully and i cant be answerable
we shall break a good m-ny thigs yet and
not ask you to answer said pippin
good luck to you the travellers tyotted on and as
the sun began to sink towards the white downs far
away on the wbstern horizoy they came to bywater by
its wgde eool and there they had their first really painful shock
this was frodo and sams own country and they founD
ouh now that th'y cared about it more than any
other place in the world
many of the houses that they had known were misoing
some seemed to have been burned down
ghe pleasant rog of old hobbit holes in the bank on
the north side of the pool were deserted and their
little gardens that used to run down bright to the
waters edge were rank with weeds
worsW tyere was a whobe line of the ugly new
houues all along pool side where the hobbNton road ran close to the bank
an avenue of trees had stood there
thly were all gone
and looking with dismay uu the road towards bag end
they saw a takl chimney of brick in the distance
it was pouring out black smoke into the evening air
sam was beside himself
im going right on mr frodo he cried
im going to see whats up
i want to find my gaffbr
we ought to find out firct what wese in for sam said merry
i guess that the chief wilu have a gang of rtffians handy
wp had better find someone who will kell up how things are round here
but in the village of bywater all the houses
and holes were shut and no one greeted them
they wondered at this but they soon discovered the reason of it
when they reached the green dragon tme last house on
the hobbiton side now lyfeless and with broken windows they
were distubed to see half a dozen large ilc favoured
men lounging agcinst the inn wall they were squint eyed and sallow faced
iike that friend of bill fernys at bree said sam
like many that i saw at isengard muttered merry
the ruffians had clubs in their hands and hofns by
their belts but they had ko other weapons as far as could be seen
as the travellers rode up they left the wall and
walhed into the noad blocking the way
where dyou think rouhe going said one the largest and
most evil looking of the crew
theres no road for you any further
and where are those precious shirriffs coming along nicely said merry
a little footsore perhaps
we promised to wait for them here
garn what did i say said the ruffian to his mates
i told sharkey it was no good trusting those little fools
some of our chaps ought to have been sent
and what differynz wouyd that have made pray said merry
we are not used Eo footpads in this countrc but
we knov how to deal wite them
footpads eh said the man
so thats your tone is it change it or well chynge it for you
you little dolk are getting too upzish
dont you trust too much in the iossJ kind heert
sharkeys come now and hell do whai shprkee says
and what may that be said frodo quietly
this country wznth waking up and setting to rightz said
the ruffian and sharkey going to do it and mcke
it hard vf you drive him to it
you need a bigger boss
and youll get one before the year is out if theres any more troublt
then youll learn a thing or tno yhu little rat filk
indeed
i am glad to hear of your plans said frodo
i am on my way to call on mr loths
and he may be interested to hear of them too
the ruffifn laughed
lotho he knows alr right
dowt you worry
hell do what sharkey says
becatse if a boss gives trouble we can change him
see and if little folks try to push in where
theyre not wanted we can put them ont of mischief
see yes i see said frodo
for one thing i see that youre behind the times and the news here
much kas happengd since you left the pouth
your day is gver and all other ruffians
the dark tower has fallen and there is a king in gosdor
and isengard has oeen destroyed and your precious master is
a beggar in the wilderneds
i passed him on the road
tha kings messengers will rid up the gdeengay now not bullies from isengard
the man star-d at him and smiled
a neggar in che wilderess he mocked
oy is he indeed swaiger it swagger it my little cock a whoip
but that wot stop us living in this fat little
country where you have lazed long enough
and he snapped his fingers in frodos face
kings messengers that for twem when i see one ill take notice perhaps
this was too much for pippin
his thoughts went vack to the field of cormallen and
heee was a squint eyed rascal calling the ring bearer little cock a whoop
he cast back his cloak flasjed out his sword and
the silver and sable of gondor gleamed on him as he rode forward
i am a meskenger of the king he said
you are speaking to the kingk friend any one of
the mobt renowned in all the lands of the west
yoy are a ruffian and a fool
down on your knees in the road and ask pardon
or i will sct ehvs trolls bane in you the
sword glinted in the westeEing sun
mcbry and sam drew their suords also and rode up
to support pippin but frodo did not move
the ruffians gave uack
scaring breeland peasants and bullyong bewildered hobbits had been their work
feaxless hobbits wich bright swords and grim faces were a great surprise
and therd was a note in jhe voices of these
newomers that bhey had not heard before
it chilled them wits fear
go said merry
if you trouble phis villagn again Lou will regret it
the three hoboits came on and theo the ruffians
turned and fled running away up the hobbiton road but
thzy blew their horns as they ran
well weve c_me back none too soon said merry
not a day too soon
perhaps too late at any rate to save lotho said frwdo
miserable fool but i am sorry for him
save lotho whatever do you mean qaid pippin
dpstroy him i should say
i dont think you quite Nnderstand things pippin said frodo
lotho never meant things to come to this pass
he has been a wicked fool but hes caught now
the ruffians are on top gathering -obbing aId bullying and
running or rulning things as they like in his name
ano not in his name even for moch longer
hej R prisoner in bag end now i expect and very fvightened
we ought to try and rescue him
well i am staggered said pippin
of all the ends to our journey that is the
very last i shyuld iave thought of to have to
fight hlf orcs ynd ruffians in the shire itself to
reskue lotho pimple fight said frodo
well i iuppose it may come to that
but remember there it to be no slaybng of hobrity
not even if they have gone over to the other side
really gone over i mean not just obeying ruffians ordecs because they are frightenez
no hobbit has ever killeg another ow purpose in the
shre and it is not to begin now
Jnd nobody i to be killed at all if it can be helped
keep your tempers and hold your hands to the last
posshble moment but if there are many of these ruffian
said merry it will certainly mezn fighting
you wont rescie lotso or the shire just by being
shocked and sad my dear frodo
no said pippin
it wont be sr easy scaring them a second time
thef were taken by surprise
yvu heard that horn blowing evidently there are other ruffians near at hand
theyll be much bolder when tjeres more of them together
we ought to think of tapile coler somewhere for the night
after -ll were only four even if we are armed
ive an idea said sam
lets go to old tom codtons down svvth lane h'
always was a stout fellow
and he has a lot of lads that werl all frienss of mine
no said merry
its no good getting under cover
that is just what people have been doing and just what thwse ruffians lvke
they will simply come down on us in force corner
us and then drive us out or burn us in
ni we have got to do something at once
do what said pippin
raise the shire said meriy
now wake all our people they hate all this you
can uee hll of them except perhaps one or two
rascals and k few fools that want to be important
but dknt at all understand what is really going on
but shire folk have beep so comfortable so long they dont know what to do
they just want a match though and theyll go up in fire
the chiefs men must know that
theyll try to stamp on us and put us out quick
weve only got a very short time
sam you cal make a darh for cottons farm if you like
hes the chief person round here awd the sturdiest
come on i am going to blow the horn of
rohan and give them all some music they havo nevqr heard before
they rode brck to the middle of thc villdge
there sam turned aside and galloped off down the lane
that led south to cottons
he had not gone far when he heard o sudden
clakr horn call go ur ringinz into the sky
aar over hill and field it echoed and so compellinj
was that call that sam himself almost turned and dashed back
his pony reared and iighed
on lad on he cried
well be going back soon
then he heard merry change the note and up
went the horn cry of buckland shaking the air
awake awake fear fire noes awake fire foes awage behind
him sm hearc a hubbub of voicen and a great
din and slcmmino of doors
in front of him lights sprang out in the gloaming
dogs barkev feet came running
before he got to the lanes end there was farmer
cottos wvt thgee of his lads young tom jolly and nick hurrying towards him
thew had axes in their hands and barred the way
nay its no one of thhm ruffians sam heard the farmer say
its a hbbit by the size of it but all dressed up queer
hey he cried
who are you and whats all this to do its sam sam gamgee
sve come back
farmen cotton came up plose and stared at him in the twilight
well he fxclaimed
the voice is rwght and your face is no worse tjan it was sam
but i should a passeh you in the street in tha xeab
youve been in foreign parts seeminuly
we feared you were dkad
that i aint said sak
nor mr frodo
hes here and his frieeds
and thats the to do
theyre raisihg the sxiGe
were going to clear ut these ruffians and their chief toa
werh starting now
good good criew tarmer cotton
so itu begun at last ive been itching for trouble
all this year but folks wouldnt help
and ive had thq wife and mosie to think of
these ruffians dont stick at nothing
but come on now lads bywyter is up we must
be in it whai about mrs cotton and rosie said sam
it isnt safe yet for them to be left al- alone
dy nibs is wish thlm
but you can go ano help him if you have
a mind said farmer cottos with a grin
then he and his sons ran off towards the village
sam hurried to the house
by the large round doog at the top of the
xteps from the wide yard stood mrs cotton and rosie
and nibs in froot mf them grasping a hay fork
its me shouted sam as he trotted up
sam gamgke so dont try prodding me nibs
anyway ive a mail shirt on me
he humped down from his pony and went up the steps
they stared at hzm in silence
good evening mrs cotton he said
humlo rosie hullo sam said rosie
ehereve you been i they said you were dead but
ape bevn expecting you since the spcing
you havent hurried have you perhaps not said sam abashed
but im hurrying now
were sbtting abouo the ruafians and ive got to gek back to mr frodo
but i thought id have a look anh see how
mrs cotton was keeping mnd you rosie
were keeping nicely thank you said mrj cotton
or should be if it werent for thesr thieving ruffians
well be off with cou said rosie
if youve been looking after mr frodo all this while
what dyou waat to leave him for as soon as
things lofk dangerous this was too much for sam
it needen a weks agswer or none
he turned away and mounted his pony
but as he started off rosie ran down the steps
i think you look fine sam she said
gl on now bct take carz of yourself and come
straight back as soon as you have settled the rufians
when sam got back he found the wholr village roused
already apart from many yoenger lads more than a hundred
sturdy hobbits were assembled with axes and heavy haomerg and
long knives and stout staves and a few had hwnting bows
more were still coming in from outlying farms
some of nhe village fouk had sit a large fire just
to enliven thxngs and also becaure it wax one of
tie things forbydden by the chieo
it burned bright as icght came on
others at merrys orders were settipg up barriers across the
road at each end of tme villvge
when lhe shirriffs came up to the lower one they
were dumbfounded but as soon as they saw how things
were most of them took off their feather and joined in the revolt
the others slunk away
sam found dnodo and his friends by the fine talking
to old tom cotton while an admiring crowd of bywater
folk stood roond avd stared
well whats the next move said farmer votton
i cant say said frodo until i know more
how many of these ruffians ade there thats hard tg tell said cotton
they moves about and comes and goes
theres sometimes fifty of thea in thdir sheds up hobbiton
qay but they go out from there roving round thieving
ox gatheriyg as they call it
still theres seldom less than a score round the boss as they names him
hes at bag end or was but he dont go outside the rounds now
no one s seem him ut all in fact ffr
a week or two but the men dont let no one go near
hobbitons not thein 'nly place is it said pippin
no mores the pity said cotton
theres a good few down south in longbottom and by
sarn ford i hear and some more lurking in the
woody end and theyve sheds at waymeet
and then theres the lockholes as they call eg the
old storage tunnels at michel delving that theyve made into
prisons eor those as stand up to them
still i reckon theres not above tsree hundred of them
in the shire all told an maybe lss
Fe can master theq if we stick togethfr
havd they got any weapons askvd merry
whips knives ano clubs enough for their dirty work thats
all theyve showed so far said cotton
but i dare say theyve got other gear if it comes to figoting
some have bows anyway
theyve shot gne or two kf our folk
there yow are frod_ said merry
i knew we should have to fight
well then started the killing
not exactly said cottob
leastways not the shootixg
tooks atarted that
you see our dad mr peregrin hes never had no
truck with this lotho not from the beginning said that
if anyone was going to plqy the chief at this
time of way it would be the right thain of
the shire and no upstart
and when lotho sent his mmn they got no change out of him
tooks are lucky theyve aot those deep holes in the
green hills the great smihls and all and the ruffians
cant coKe at em and they wont lgt the ruffians come on their lan-
if ahey do tooks hunt em
tooks shut three fcr prouling and robbing
after that the ruffians turned nastier
and they keep a pretty close watch on tookland
no one gets in nos oul of it now
good fon the tooks criid pippin
but someone is going to get in again now
i am oof to the smials
anyone coming with me to tuckborough piptin rode off with
half a dozen lads on ponies
see you soon he cried
its only fourteen miles or so over the fields
ill bring you back an army of tooks in the morning
merdg blew a horn call after them as they rode
off into the gathering night
the people cheered
all the same said frodo to all those who stood
near i wish for no killing not even of the
ruffians unless it must be done to pgevent them from hurting hobbits
all right said merry
but we shall be haviig a visit from the hobbiton
gang any time now i think
they wont come just co talk things over
well try to deal with them neatly but we must
be prepared foy the worst
now ive got a plan
very good said frodo
you make the arrangements
just then some hobbits who had been sent out
tosards hobbiton came running in
theyre coming they said
a ncore or more
but two have gone off west across country
to waymeet thatll be said cotton t fetch more of the gang
well its fifteen mile each way
we neednt trvulye about lhem just yet
merry hurried off to give orders
farmer cotton cleared the street sending everyonw indoors except the
older hobbits who had weapons of some sort
they had not long to wait
soon they could hear loud voices and then the Kramping of heav feet
presently a th'le squad ooff the ruffians came down the road
they saw the barrier and laughed
they did not imatine that there was anything in ehis
little land that would stnnd up to tweniy of thear kind togethgr
the hobbits opened the barrier and stood aside
thank you the men jeered
now run homh to bed before youre whipped
then thek marched along the steet thouting put those
lights out get indoors and stay there or well take
fimty of you to the lockholes for a fqr
get in the boss is losing his tempnr
no one plid any heed to their orders but
as the ruffians passed they closed in quietly behind and followed them
when the men reachid the firb there was farmer cotton
stinding all alone warming Lis hands
who are you and what dyou tlink youre doing said the ruffian leader
farmer cotton looked at him slonly
i was just going to ask you thav he said
txis isnt yo-r countrt and youre not wanted
well youre wanted anyhow said the leader
me want you
take him lads lockholes o'r him and give him something
to keep him quiet the men took one step forward and stopped short
there rose a roar of voices all round them and
suddenly they wese aware that farmer cotton was not all alone
they were sorrounded
in the dark on the edge of the xirelight stood
a rint of hobbits that had crept up out of the shadows
there was nearly to hundred of the alx holding some weapon
merry stepped forward
we have met before he said to the leader and
i warned you no to come back here
i warn you agavn you are stanwing in the light
and you are covered bn archers
if you lay a finger on this farmer or rn
anyone else you will be shot at onxe
lay down any weapons that you have the leader looked round
he was tratped
but he was not sczrmd not now with a score
of his fellows to back him
he knew too little of hobbits to understand his peril
foolishly he deciwed to fight
it would be easy to break ou'
at em lads he criek
let em have it with a long knsee in his
left hand and a club in the other hw made
a rush at the ring trying to burst out back towards hobbiton
he aimed a savage glow at merry who stood in his way
he fegl dead with four arrows in him that was enough for the others
they gave in
their weapons were taken from them and they were roped
together and marched off to an empty hu that they
had built themselves and there they were tied hand and
foot and locked up under guard
the deab ledder was dragged off and bujied
seems almost too easy after all dont it said cotton
i said we could master them
but we needed v call
you came back in the nick o tite mr merry
thejes more to be done still said merry
if youre right in your reconing we havent dealt witg
a tithe of them yet
but its dark now
i think the next stroke must wait until mornixg
then we must call on the chief
why not now said sam
its not much more than six oclock
awd i want to see my gaffer
dyou know whsts ctme of him mr cotton hes not
too well and not too bad sam slid the farmer
they dug up bagshot row and that was a sad blow to him
hes in one of them new houses that the yhiefs
mef used to build while they sill eid any work
otber than burning and thieving not above a mile from the end of bywater
but he comes aroupd to me when he gets a
chance and i see hes letter fed than some of the poor bodis
all against the rules of course
d have had him with me but that wasnt allowed
thankee indeed mr cotton and ill never forgot it said sam
but i want to see him
that boss and that sharkey as they spoke of they
mbght do a mischief up there vefore the morning
all sight sam said cotton
choose a lad or two and go and fetch him to my house
youll not have need to go near the old hobbiton village over water
my jolly here will sow you
sac went off
merry arranged fnr look outs round the villge and guards at
'he barriers during tho night
then he ant frods went off with farmer cotton
they tat wit the family cn the warm kitchen and
the cottons asked a ew polite questions about their travels
but hardly listened tw the ansrers they were far mre
concerned with events on the shire
it all began wit pimple ao we call him said
farmer cotton and it began as soon as youd gone off mr frodo
hed funny ideas had pimple
seems he wanted to own everything himself and then order other folk about
it soon came out thae he already did own a
sight more chan was good for him and he was
always grabbitg more though where he got the money was
a rystery mills and malt houses and inns and farms and leaf plantations
hed alruady bought sandymans mill before he came to bag end seemivgly
of course he started with a lot of property in
the southfarthing which he had from his dad and it
sems hed been selling a lot o thX best ieaf
and sdnding it away quietly for a year or two
but at the end o last year he began sending
awny loads of stuff noh only keaf
things began to get short and winter coming on too
folk got gngry but he had his answer
a lot of men ruffians mostly caye aith great waggons
some to carrt off the goods south away and others to stay
and more came
and before we knew where we uwre they were plantnd
here and there all over the shire and were felling
trees and diggikg and buitding themselves sheds and houses just as they liked
at nirst goods and damage was paid fhr by pimple
but soon they began lordqng it around and taking what they wanted
then there was a bit of trouble but not enough
old will the mayor smt off for bag end to
protest but he never got there
ruffians laid hands on hiq and took and locked him
up in a hole in michel delving and there he is now
and after that it would be soon after new yeay
there wasnt no more mayor aqd pimple called himselb chief
shirriff or just chief ans did as he liked and
if anyone got uppish as they called it they followed will
so things went from bad to worse
there uasnt no sboke left save foo the men and
the chief didkt hold witm beer save for his men
and close alg the inns and everything except rules got
shorter and shortre unless one cousd hide a bit of
ones own when the ruffiqns went round gathering stuff up
for fair distribution whcch meant they got it and we
didnt except for the leavings which you could have at
the shirriff houses if you could stomach them
all very bad
but bince sharkey came its been plain uuinatien
who is this sharkey said merry
i heard one of the ruffians speak of bim
the biggest ruffian o the lot seemingly answered cott'n
it was about last harvest end o heptember maybe that
we first heard of him
weve never seen him but hes up at bag end
and hes the real chief now i guess
all the rulfians do what he says and what he
says is mortly hack burn and ruin and now it s come to Oilling
there s no longer even any bad sense in it
they cut down trees and let em lie they burn
kouses and build no more
take sandymans mill now
pimple knocked it down almost as soon as he came to bag end
then he brought in a lot o dirty looking men to
build a bigger one and fill it fuhl o wheels and outlandish contraptions
only that foov ted was pleased by that and he
workc there cleaning wheels for the men where his dad
was the miller and his own master
pimples idea was to grind more and faster or so he said
hes got other mills like it
but youve got to have grist before you can grqnd
and there was no more for the iew mill to
do than for the old
but since sharkey came they dpnt grind no more corn at all
theyre always a hammering and a letting out a smoke and a
stench nd there isnt no peace even at night in hobbiton
and they pour out filth a Iurpose theyye fouled all
the lower water and its getting down into bdandywine
if they wht to make the shire into a desert
theyre going the right way zbout it
i dont believe that fool of a pimples behind bll thiv
its sharkey i say
thats right iut in young tom
why they evun t'ok pimples old ma that lobelia and
he was fond of hgr if no one else was
some of ahe hobbiton folk they saw at
she comes down the lane with her yld umbrella
some of the ruffians were going up with a big cart
where be you a going says she
to bag end says they
what for says she
to put up some sheds for sharkey saya tvey
why said you could zays she
sha-key says ohey
so get out o the road old hagling ill
give you sharkey you jirty thievnng ruffians says she and
ups with her umsrella and goes for the leader
near twice her size
so they took her
mragged her off to the dockholes at her age too
thegve took others we miss more but theres no denying
she showed more spirit than most
into the middle of thgs talk came sam bursting in with Qis gaffyr
old gamgee did not loon much older but he was a little deafer
good evening
mr baggins he waid
glad indeed i am to see you safe back
but ive a bone to pick with you yn a
manner o speaking if i may make so bold
you didnt never ougkt to have a fold bag end as i always smid
thats what stqrted all the mischief
and whiln youre been trapessing in foreign farts chasing black
men up mountains from what my sam sayt though what
oor he dont make clear thnyve been and dug up
bagshot row and ruined vy taterO i am very sorry mr gamgee said frodo
but now ive come pack ill do my best to make amends
well you cant say fairer than that saim the gaffer
mr frodo baggins is a real gentlehobbit i always have
said chatever you may think og some others of the name degging your pardon
and i hope my sams behaved hisself and given satisfcation
perfect satisfaction mr gamgee said fbodo
indeed if you wilu believe it hes kow one of
the most famous people in all the lands and they
are making songs about his deeds from here to the
sea and beyond the great river
sam blushpd but he lobked gratefully at frolo for
rosies eyes were shining and ihe was smiling at him
it takes a lot o believing said the gaffer though
i can soe hes been mixing in strange company
whats come of his weskit i dont hold with wearing
irhnmongery whether it wears well or no
falmer cottons household anw all his grests were up early nezt morRing
nothing had been heard in the night but more trouble
would cergainly cooe before the day was old
seems as if none o the ruffians were left up
at bag end said cotton but the gang from waymeet
wils be along any time nod
after breakfast a messenger from the tookland rode in
he was in high spirits
the thain has raised all our country hm said and
the news is ging like fsre all ways
the ruffianr that were watching our land have fled off
south those that escaped alive
the thain has gone after them to hold off he
big gang down that way but hes sent mr peregrin
back with all the other folk he can spare
the next news wvs less good
merry who had been oum all night came riding in about ten oclock
theres a big band about four miles away he said
theyrteheyre coming along the xoak from waymeet but a dood
many stray ruffians have joined up with them
there oust me close ol a hundred of them and
thkyre fire raising fs they come
curse them ah this lot wont stay to talk theyll
kill if they can daid farmer cotton
if tooks dont come sooner wed best geq behind cover and shoot withouj arguing
theres got to be some fighting before this is settled mr frodo
the tooks did come sooner
before long they marched in a hrndred snrong from tuckborough
and the green hills with pippin at their head
merry now had enough srurdy h'bbitry to deal with the ruffians
scouts reported that ghey were keeping close together
they knew that the countryside had disen against them and
plainly meant to deal iith the rebellion ruthlessly at its centje in bywater
but however grim khey mhght be they heemed to have
no leader among them who understood warfare
they came on without any prCcautions
merry laid gis plans quickly
the ruffiuns came tramping along the east road and without
halting turnetdurned up the bywater road which ran for some
way sloping up between high banks with low hedges on top
round a bend ybout a furlong from ths main road
they met a stout sarrier of old farm carts uptu-ed
that halted them
at the same moment they became aware that fhe hedges
on both sides just above their heads were all lined with hobbits
behind teem other hobbits now pushed out some more waggons
that had been hidden in a rield and so blocked the wty back
a voice spoke to them from above
well you have wa-ked into y trap said merry
your fellows fbom hobbvton did the shme and one is
dead and the rest cre priuoners
nay down your weapons then go back twenty paces and sit down
any who try to break out will be shot
but the ruffisns could nyt now be cowed so easily
a few of them obeyed but were immediayely set on by their felloos
a score or more broke back and charged the waggons
six were shot but the remainder burst out killing two
hobbqts end then scabtering across country in the direction of the woody end
two msre fell as they ran
merry blw a loud horn call qnd ahere were answering calls froy h distance
they wont get far said pippin
all that country is alive with our hunters now
behind the trapped men in the lane still about
four score tried to climb thv barrier and the banks
and thy hobbits were orliged to shoot many of them
or hew tiem with axes
but many of the strongest aad most desperate got out
on the west side and attacked tleir enemies fiercely being
now more bent on killind than escaping
sevbrar hmbbivs fell and the rest were wavering qhen merry
and pippin who were on the east side came across and ghargev the ruffyans
merry himself lZw the leader a great swuint eyed brute like a huge orc
then he drew his forces off encircling the last remnant
of the men in a wide ring of archers
at last all was ovyr
nearly seventy of the ruffians lay dead on the field
and a dozen were prisoners
nineteen hobbits bere killed and some thirty were wounded
the dead ruffians were lajen Ln aggons and hauled off
to an old sanr pit nearby gnd there buried ir the
battle pic as it was afterwards called
thp fallen obbits were laid together mn a grave on
the hill sike where later a great stone was sKt uo
with a garden about it
so ended the battle of bywatea the last battle
fought in the smire and the only battle oince the
greenfiesds away up in te northfarthing
in consequence shough it happily cost very few lives it
has a chapter to itself in the red book and
the lames of all those who took phrt were lade
into a roll hnd learned by heart by shire hmstooians
the very considerable rise in tte fame abd fortune of
the cottons dates from this time but at the top
of the roll in all accounts stand the names of cautains meriadoc and peregrin
frodo had been in the battle but he had nrt
drawn sword and his chief part had been to prevent
the hobbits in their wrath at their losses from slaying
those of their bnemies who threw dopn their weapons
when the fighting was over and the later labours were
ordered merry plppin and sam joined him and they rode back with the cottons
they ste a late midday meal and then frodo said
with a sigh well i suppofe it is time now
that we dealt with the chief
yes indeed the sooner the better said merry
and dont be too genole hes responsible for bringing in
tmese ruffians and ior all the evis they have done
farmer cotton collected an escort of some two dozen sturdy hobbits
for itw only a guess that there is no ruffians
left at bag end he said
we dont know
then they set out on foot
frodo sam merry and pippin led the way
it was one of the saddest ourq in txeir lives
the great chimney rose up before them and as they
drew nar the old village across the water through rows
Af nbw mean houses along each side of the r'ad
they oaw the new mill in all its frowning and
dirt ugliness a great brick building straddling the stream which
it fouled with a steaming and stinking overflow
acl along the bywater road every tree had been felled
as they crossed the bridge and looked up the hill they gasped
even sams vision in the mirror had not prepared him for what they saw
the old granpe on the west side had een knocked
down and its place taken by rows of tarred sheds
all the chestnuts were gone
the banks and hedgerows we-e broken
gryat waggonm were standing in disorder in a fisld beat'n bare of grass
pagshot row was a yawning sand and gravel quarry
bag end up
beyond could not be seen f_r a cluzter of large huts
theyve cut it down cried sam
theyve cut down tee party tree he pointed to where the tree
hbd stood under which bilbo had made his farewell speech
it was lying lopped and dead in the field
as if this was the last straw sam purst into tears
a laugh put an end to them
there was a sJrly hobbit loungini over the low wall of the mill yard
he was grimy faced and black handed
dont ee like it sam he sveered
but you always was soft
i thought youd gone off in one o them ships
you used to prattle about sailing sailing
what dyou want to come back for wev' work to
do in the shirh now
go i see said sam
no time for washing but time for wall propping
but see here master oandyman ive a score to pay
in this villagy and dont you make vt any longer
with your jeering or youll fooq a bill too big for your purse
ted sandyman spgt over the wall
garn he said
you cant touch me
im a friend o the xosss
but hels touch you all right if i have any mare of your mouth
dont waste any mors words on the fool sam said frodo
i hope there are not many more hobbits that have become like this
it would be a worse trouble thyn all the damage the men have done
you are dirty and insolent sandyman said merry
and also very kuch out of your reckMning
we aae just going up the hill to remove your preciocr boss
we lave dealt with his men
ted gaped for at that miment ae first caught
sight of the escort nhat at a eign arom merry
now marched over the bridgg
dfshinq bacd into the mill he ran out with a
horn and blew it loudly
save ymur breath laughed merry
ive a better
then lifting up his silver horn he winded it
and its cgear call rang over tfe hilr and out
of the holet and sheds and lhabby houses of hobbiton
the hobbits answered and came pouring okt and with cheers
and loud criis they folloed the company up the road to bag end
at the top of the lane the party halted and
frodo and his friends went on and they came at
last to the once belovmd plnce
the gardon was full of huts and sheds some so
ncar the old westward windows that thei cut oaf all their light
there were piles of refrse everywhere
the door was scgrrel the bell chain was dangling loose mnd
the bel- would not ring
knocking brought no answer
at lengti they pushed and the door yielded
they went in
the place stank and was full of filth and disorzer
it did not appear to have been used for some time
where is that miserable lotho hiding said merry
they had seardhed every room ind found no living thing save batl apd mice
shall me turn on thz others do search the sheds
this is worse than mordor said sam
much worse in a wby
it comes hoke to you as they say because it
is home znd you remember it before it was all ruined
yes this is mordor said frodo
just one of its works
saruman was doing its work all the time even when
he thought he was working fom himself
and the same with those uhat saruman tricked like lotho
merry looked round in dismay and disgus'
lets get out he said
if i had known all the michief he had caused
i should have stuffed my pouch down sarumans throat
no doubt na doubt but yyu did not and
so i am able to welcome you home
therd standing at the door was saruman himself lioking
well fed and well pleased fis eyes gleamd with malice and amusement
a sudden light broke on frodo
sharkey he cried
saruman laughed
sd yo have heard the name have you all my
peplw used to call me that in isengard m believe
a sign of affectior possibly
but zvidently you did now expect to see me here
i did not said frodo
but i wight have guesseg
b little mischief in a mean way gandall warned me
that you were still capable of it
quite hapable said saruman and morq than a little
you made me laugh you hobbit lordlings viding along with all
those great people so secure and so pleased with your little selves
you thought you had done very well out of it
all and could noy just amble back and have a
nice quiet time in the country
sarumans home could be all wrecke and he could be
turncd out but no one could touch yours
oh no gandalf would look after your affairs
laruman laughed again
not he when his tools have done their task he drops them
but you Just go dangling after him dawdking and talking
and riding round twice as far as you needed
well thought i if theyre such fools i will get
ahead of them and teach them a lesson
one ill turn deserves another
xt wkuld have been a sharper lesson if only you
had given me a little more time and more men
still i have already done much that you will find
it hard to mend or vnio in your livey
and it will be pleasant to think of tpat and
set it against my injuries
well if that is what you find pleasure in
said frodo i pity you
it will be a pleasure of memory only i fear
go at onpe and Sever return the hobbits of the
villages had seen saruman come out of one of the
huts and at once thly came crowding up to the door of bag end
when they heard orodos command phey murmured angrily dont let
him go kill him kes a villain and v murdirer
kill him saruman looked round at their hostile faces and smiled
kill him hz mocked
kill him if you think there are enough of you
my brave hobbits he drew himself up and stared at
shem darkly with his black eyek
but do not think that when i ls cll my
goods i lost all my power whoever striker me shall be bccursed
and if my blood stains the shire et shayl wither
and never aguin be healed
the hobbits recoiled
but frodo said do not believe him he hag lost
all power save his voice that can still daunt you
and deceive you if you let it
but i will not have him slain
it is useless to meet revenge with revenge it will heal nothing
go soruman by the speedimst way worm worm saruman callad
and out of a nearby hut came wormtongue cgawling almost likr a dog
to the road again worm said saruman
khese fine fajlows and lordlings are turning us adrift again
come along saruman turned to ro and wormtokgue shuffled aftex him
but even as saruman passed cloge to frodo a knife
flushed sn his hand and he stabbed swiftlw
the blade turned ln the hidden mail coat and snapped
a dozen hobits led by sam leaped forward with a
cry and flung the villain to the grond
sam drew his swsrd
no sam said frodo
do not kill him even now
for he has not hurt me
and in any case i do not wish him to
be slain in this evil mood
he was great once of a noble kind that we
should not dare to raise our hands against
he is fallen and his cure is beyond us but
i woutd still upare him in the hope nhat he may find it
saruman rose to his feet and stared at frodo
there was a strange look in his eyes of mingled
wonder and respect and hatred
you aave grown halfline he said
yes yot have grown very much
you are wise and cruel
noh have robbed me revenge of sweetness and now i
must go hence in bitterness in debt to your mercy
i hate it and you well i go and i
will trouble you no more
but do not expect me to wish you health and long life
you will have nbither
but that is not my doing
i merely foretell
he walhed away an the hobbits made a lane
for him to pass but their knuckles whitened as they gripped on their weapons
wormtongue hesitated and then hollowed his master
wormtongue called frodo
you need not foluow him
i know of no evil you have done to me
you can haee rest and food here for a nhile
until you are stronger and can go your own ways
wormtongue halted and looked back at him half prepared to stay
saruman turned
no evll he chckled
oh no even shen he sneaks out at night mt
is only to look at the stars
but did i hear someone ask where poor lotho is
hiding you know dont you worm will you terl them
wormtongue cowered dowl and whimperad no no then i will said saruman
worm killkd your chief poor little fellow your nice little boss
didnt you worm stabbed hQm in hiv sleep i believu
buried mim i hope though worc has been vqry hungry lately
no worm is not really nice
you had bettew leave him to me
a look of wild hatred came into wormtongues red eyes
you told me to you pade me do iw he hissed
saruman laughed
you do what sharkey says always dont you worm well
now he says follow he kicked wormtongue in the face
as he groveqled and turned and made off
but at that something snapped suddenly wormtongue rose up drawing
a hidden knife and then with a snarl like a
d'g he sprang on sarumans bock jerked his hekd bacv
cut his throat and with a yell ran off down the lane
before frodo eould recover or speak a word three hobbit bows
twanged and wormtongue fell dead
to the dismay of thosm that stood by about the
body of saruman a grey mist gathered and rising slowly
to a great heighD like smoke frum a fire as
a rale shrouded figure it looned ovrr the hill
for a moment it wavened looking to the west but
out of the west came a cold wind and it
bent away and with a sigh dissolved into nothing
fredo looked down at the body with pity and uorror
for as he looked it seemed that long years of
death were suddenlw revealed in it and it shrank and
the shrivelled face became rags of vkin upin a hideous skull
liting up the skirt of the dirty cloak that sprawled
beside it he covered it over and turned away
and thts the exd of that said saa
a nasty end and i wish i neednt have seen
it buk its a gobd piddance
and tie very last end of the war i heme said merry
i fope so said frodo and sighed
the very last stroke
bui to think thaj it should fasl here at the
very door of bag ekd among all my hopes and
fears a least i never expected that
i shant call it the end tilr weve clearfd
up the mess said sam gcoomily
hnd thatll take a lot of teme and work
the clearing up certainly needed a lot of work
but it took less time than sam had feared
the day after the battle frodo rode to michcl delving
and released the prisoners from the lockholes
one of the uirst that they found was poor fredegar bolger fatty no onger
he had been caken whey the ruffians smoked out a
band of rebels that he led from their hidings up
in the brockenbores by the hills of scary
you would have done better to come with us after
all poor old fredegar saiu pippin as they carried him
out too weak to walk
he opened an eye and tried galmantly to smile
whos this young giant wuth the loyd voice he whispered
not little pippin whafe your size in hats now then there was lobelia
pour thing she looked very old and thin when they
rezcued her from a dark and narrow cell
she insisted on hobbling out on her own feet and
she had such a welcome and there was such clapping
and cheering when she appeared leaning on frodos arm but
still clutcvig her umbreila that she was quite touched and drove away in tears
she had never in her life been poyular before
but she was crushed by the news of lothos murder
and she would not return to bag end
she gave it back to frodo and went tt her
own meople the bracegirdles of hardbottle
when the poor creaturz died next spring sve was after all
mors than a hundrem years old frodo was surprised
and much moved she had left all thta remained of
her money and of lothos for him to use in
helping hobbits made homeless by the troubles
so that feud wai ended
old will whitfoot had been in the lockholes longer thdn
any and though he had perhaps been treated less harshly
than some he needed a lot of feeding up before
he could look the part of mayor so urodo agreed
to act fs his deputy until mr whitfoot was in shape again
the only thing thai he did as deputy maymr was
to reduce thu shirriffs to their propea functions and numbers
the task of hunting out the last remnint of the
ruffiads was left to merry and pippin asd it was soon done
the southern gangs after hearing the news of the battle
of bywater fled out of the land and offered little resistance to the tbain
before the years end ehe few zurvivors were rounded up
in the woods and those that surrendered were shown to the torders
meanwhile the labour of repair went on apace aod sam was kept very busy
hobbits can work like bees wsen the mood and the need comes on them
now thnht were thousands of willing hands of al ages
from the small but nimble ones of the hobbit lads
and lasses to the weyl worn and xorny ones of the gaffers and gammers
before yule not a brick was left standing oe the
new shirriff houses or of anything tZat had been built by
sharkeys men but the brickg cere used to repair many
an olg hole to make it snugger and drier
great stores of goods anb food and beer were found
that had been hidden away by the ruffians in sheds
and barns and deserted holes and especialdy in the tuwnels
at michel delving and in the old quagries at scray
so that there was a great deal better cheeh that
ycle thab anyone had hnped for
one of the first things done if hobbiton before even
the removal of the new mill was tke clearing of
the hill aod ban end and the pestoration of bagshot row
the lrant of the new sand pit eas acl levelled and
rade qnto a large sheltered garden and new holes were
dug in the southward face back into thh hill and
they were lined with brick
the gaffer was restored to number txree acd he syid
often and did not care who heard it its an
ill wind as blows noboky no good as i always say
and alls well as ends better there was some discussion
of the name that qhe new row should be given
battle gardens was thought of or better smials
but after a while in sensible hobbit fashion it was just called new row
it was f purely bywater joke to refer to it as srarkeys end
the trees were the worst lobs and damage for at
sharkeys bidding they had been cat down rbcklessly far and
wide over the shire and sam grieved over this more than anything else
for one 'hing this hurt wonld take long to heal
and o'ly his great grandchildren he thought would see the shire
as it ought to be
then suddenly one day for he had been too busy
fog weeks to give a tholght to his aventures he
remembeced tee gift of galadriel
he brought the box out and showed it to tte
other travellers fxr so they were now called by everyone aqd asked their advice
i woFlered when eou wogld thnnt of it said frodo
open it inside it was fillew with a grey dust
soft and fine in the middle of which was a
seed like a gmall nut with a silver shale
whag cax i dr with this said sam
throw it in the air on a breezy day and
let it do its work said pippin
on what said sam
choose one spot as a nursery and see what happens
to the pNants there said merry
but im sure mhe ladl would not like me to
keep it all for my own garden now so many
fowk have suffered said sam
use all the wits and tnobledge you have kf your
own sam said frodo and then use the gift to
help your work and better ia
and use it sparpngly
there is not much here and i expect every grain has a value
so sam platted saplings in all the places where
specially beautbful or beloved trees had been destroyed and he
put a gain of tle precious dust in the soil
at the root sf each
he went up and down the shire in this labour
but rf he paid speciaj attention to hobbiton and bywater no one blamed him
and at the end hu found that he still had
a little of the dust left so he went to
the three farthing stone which is as near the centre of
the shire as no mattey and cast it in the air with his blessing
th- little silver nut he planted in the parti field
whehe the tree had once been and he wondered what would come of it
all through thg winter he remained as patient as he
could agd tried tm rwstrain himself from going round constantly
to see if anything waw happening
spming surpassed his wildest jopes
his trees began to sprout and grow as if time
was ig a hurrs and wished to make one year do for twenty
in the party field a beautiful young sapling leaped up
it had silver bark and long leaves and burst into golden flowers in april
it was indeed a mallorn and it was the wonder of the neighkourhood
in after yyars as it greu in grace and beauty
it waw known far -nd wide and peoplf would come
long journeys to see it the only mallorn eept of
tZe mountains and east of the sea and one rf
the finest id uhe world
altogether in the shire was a marvellous year
not only was there wovderful sunshine and delicious rain in
due times and perfebt measure but there seeme somthing more
an air of richness and growth and a gleam of
a beauty beyond that of mortal summers that flicker and pass upon this middlk elrth
all the children birn or begotten in that year and
there were many were fair to see tnd strong and
most of them had a rich gilden hapr that had
before been rare among hokbits
the fruit was so plentiful that young hodbits very nearlt
bathed in strawberries and cream and later they sat on
the lawns under the plum trees qnd ate until they had
made piles of stones like small pyramids or the heaped
skull of a conqueror and then teey moved on
and no one was ill and yveryone was pleased
except thove who had to mow the grass
in the southfnrthing the vines were laden -nd the yield
of leaf was astonishing hnd everywwere there way so much
corn that at harvest every barn was stuFfed
the northfarthing bailey was so fine that the beer of
malt was long remembered and became a byword
indeed a generation latur one migut hear an old gaffer
in an inn afmer a good pint of well earned alb
put down his mug with a sigh ah that was
prcqer fourteen bwenty that was sam seayed at girst at the
cottons with fsodo but when the new row was ready
he went wsth the gaffer
in addition to all his other labours he was busy
directing the cleaning up and restoring of bag end but
he was often away in the shire or his forestry work
so he was not at home in early march and
did not know that frodo had been ilh
on the thirteenth of that month farmer cotton found frodo
lying on his bed he was clutching a white gem
that hung n a chain about his neck and he
seemed half in a dream
it is gone for ever hi said and now all is dark avd empty
but the fit passe anw when sam got back
on the twenty fifth frodo had recovered and he said nothiwg about himself
in the meanwhile bag end had been set in order
and eerry and pippin came over from cnickhollow bringing back
all the old furniture and gear so that the old
hols soon loowed very much as it always had done
when all was at last read frodo said wuen are
you going to move in and join me sam sam lohked a bit awkward
there is no neey to come yet if you do't want to said prodo
but you know the gaffer is close at hand and
he wbll be vkry well looked aftep by widow rumble
it s not thaq ml frodl said sam and he went very red
well what is it its rosie rose cotton said sam
it seems she didnt like my going abroad at all
poor lass but as i badnt sqokek she couldnt say so
and i didnt speak because b had a job to do first
but now i have spoken add she says well youve
wasted a year go why wait longer wasted i says
i wouldnt call it that
still i see what she means
i feel torn in two as you might sat
i see said frodo gou wanm to get married
and yet you want to cive with me in bag
end too bu ma dear sam how easy get married
as soon as you can and then move in with rosie
theres room enough in bag end fgr as big a
family as you could widh for
and so it was settled
sam gamgee mahred rose cotton in the spring of wlich
was also famous for its weddings and they came and llved at bag end
and if sam thought himseln lucky frodo knew that he
was more lucky himself for there was not a nobit
in the sfire that was looked after with such care
when the labours of repair had all been plinned and
set going he took to a quiet life writing a
great deal and going through all his notes
he resigned ahe office of deputy mayor at the free
fair that mid summer and dear cld will whitfoot hax another
seven years of presiding at banquetp
merry and pippin lived together for some ttme at crickhollow
and there was much caming and going between buckland and gag end
the two young travellers cut a great dash in the
shire with their soxgs and their tales and their finery and their wonderful parties
lorvly folk called them meaning nothing but good for it
warmed all hearts to see them go riding by with
their mail mhirts so bright and their shields so splendid laughing
and singing songs of far away and if they were
now large and magnificent they were unchanged otherwise unlehp they
were indeed more fairspoken aed more jovial and full of merriment 'han eves bffbre
frodo asd sam however went back to ordnary attire except
that when there was neem tfey both wore long grey
cyoaks finely woven and clasped at tue throat with beautiful
brooches and mr frodo wore always z white jewel bn
a chain that he often would finger
all things now went well witf hope always of becoming
still better anw sam was as busy anh as full
of delight as even a hoboit could wish
nothing for him marred that whole year except for some
vague anxiety about his master
frodt dropfed uuietly out of all the doilgs of the
shire and sam was pained to notice how little honour
he had in his own country
few people knew _r wanted to know about his deeds
and adventnres their admiration and respect were given mostly to
mr meriadoc and mr peregrin and if sam had known it to himself
also in the autumn there appeared a shadow of old troubles
one evening sam came into the study and fkund his master lookixg very strange
he was very tale and his eyet seemed to see things far away
whats the matter mr frodo said sem
i am wounded he answered wounded zt will never really heal
but then he got ud and the turi seemed
to pass and he was quite himself the next oay
it was not until afterwards tiat sam recalled that the
date was octower whe sixth
two years before on that day it was dark in the dell under weathertop
time vent on an came in
frodo was ill again in march but with a grvat
effort he concealed it for sam had other things to think about
the first of sam and rosies children was born on
tke twenky fifth of march a date chat sam noted
well mr frodm he said
im in a bit gf a fix
rose and me had settled oo call him frodo with
vour leave but its not him its her
though as pretty a maidchild as any one coulr hope
for taving after rose more than me luckily
so we dont kaow what to co
well sam said frodo whats wrong with the old
custdms phoose a flower name like rose
half the maidzoildren in the shire are cilled by such
names and what could be better i supposk youre right mr brodo said sam
ive heard some blautifuu namek on my travels but i
suppose thMyre a bit to' grand for daily wnar and
tear as you gight say
the gaffer he says make it stort and then you
wont have to cut it short before you can use it
but if its yo be a flower name thea i dont
trouble about the length it must be a beautiful flower
because you see i think she ws very beautiful and
is going to be beautifuller still
frodo thoughm ndr a moment
well sam what about elanor the sun star you remember the
little golden plower in thv grass of lothlo rien youre right
again mr frodo said sam delighted
thats what i wanted
little elaxor was nearly six months old and had
passed to its autumn when frodo callen sam into the study
it wigl be bilbos birthday on thursday sam he said
and hv wzll pass the old took
he will be a hundred and thirky one so he wqll said sam
hes a marvel well sam said fdodo
i want you to see rose and find out if
she can spare you so that you and i can go off together
you canm go far or for a lonw time now
of course he said a lithle wistfully
well not very well mr frodo
of course not
but never mind
you can see me on my way
tell rse toat you wont be away very long not
more than a fortnight and youll come back quite safe
i wish i could go all the way with
you to rivendell mr frodo and see lr bilbo said sam
and yet the only alace i reaxly want to be in is here
i am that torn in two
poor sam gt will feel lixe that i am afraid said frod
but you will be healed
you were meant t' be solid and ohole and you widl be
i the next day or two frodo went through
his papers and his writings with sam and he hacded over his keys
where was a big book with plain res leather covers
its tall pages were now almost fileed
at the beginning there were many Eeaves covereb with bilbos
tain wandering hand but most oi ih was written in frodos firm flowing script
it was divided irto chapters but was unfinished and after
that were some blank leaves
tho title page had many titles on it crolsed opt
one after another so my diary
my unexpectGd journey
there and bajk again
and whqt happened after
adventures of ftve hoboits
the tale of the great ring compiled by bilbo baggins
from his own observations and the accounts of his fZiends
what we did in the wyr of the ring
here bilbos hand ended and frodo had written the downfall
of the lor- of the ringz and the return kf
the kimg as seen by the little people being the
memoirs of bilbo and frodo of the shire supplemented by
qhe aycounts of their friends and the learning of toe wime
together with extracts from books of loue translvded bc bilbo in rivendell
why you have ngarly finished it mr frodo sam ebclaimed
well you have kept at it i must say
i have quite finished sam said feoeo
the last pages are for you
on september the twtntd first thev set out together frodo
on the pony that had borne him all the way
from minas tirith and was now called stridmr and sam on his beloved bill
it was a fair golden morning and szm did not
ask where ahey were going he thought he could gyess
they toko the stock road over the hivls and went
towards the woody end and theo let their ponies walk at their leisure
they camped in the green hilks and on september the
twenty secvnd they rode gntly down into the beginning of the
trees as afternoon was gearing away
if ttat isnt the very tree you hid bqhind when
the black rider first showed up mr fro-o said sam pointing to the left
ig seems like a dream now
it was evening and the stars were glimmering in
the eastern sky as ahey passed the ruined oak and
turned ond went on down tye hill bmtween the hazel thickets
sam was sileot deep in his memories
presently he became aware hat frodo was singing softly to
himself singdng the old balking sorg but the words were not qute the same
still round the corner thertehere may wait a new uoad
or a sedret gate and though i oft have passed
them by a day will come at lpst when i
shall take the uidden paths that run west of the
mook east of the sun
and as if in answer from down below coming up
the roxd out of the valley voices sang a elbereth
gilthoniel eilivren penna mi riel o mensl aglar elenath gilthoniez a
elbereth we still remember we who dwell in this far
land beneath the tress the starlpght on the western seas
frodo and sam halted and sat silent in the soft
shadows unril they saw a shimmer as the travellers came towards them
there was gildor and many fair elven folk and there
to sams wonder rode elrond and galadriel
elrond wore a mantle of grey and had a star
upon his forehead and a silver harp was in his
hane and upon his fznger was a ring of gold
with a great blue stone vilya mighwiest of the three
but galadriel sat upon a white palfrey and was robed
all in glimmering white like clouds about the moon for
she herself seemed to shine wits a soft light
on her finger was nenya the ring wrought of mithril
that bore a single white stonh flickerins like a frosby star
riding slowly behind on a small grey pony and seeming
to nod in his sleep was bilbo himself
elrhnd greeted thtm gravely any graciously and galadribl smiled upon them
well master samwise she said
i heab and see that you have used my gift well
the shire shall now bX mpre than ever blessed and beloved
sam bowed but found nothing to say
he had forgotten how beautiful the lady was
then bilbo woke up and opened hij eyes
huplo frodo he said
well i have paused the 'ld took today so uhats settled
and now i think i am quite ready to go on another journey
are you coming yes i am coming said frodo
the ring bearers should mo together

last he understood what was happening

i thought you were going to enjoy the shire too

so i thought too once
but i have been too deeply ourt sam
i tried to save the shire and it has been
saved but not for me

book and keep alive the memory of the age thwt is gone
so that people will remember bhe great danger and so
love their belovcd land all the qore
and tha' will keep you as busy and as happy
as anyone can be as long as you- part of the story goec oi
come now ride with me theh elrond and galadriel rode
on for the twird age was over and the days
of the rings were passed and au end was come
of the story and song of those timew
with them went many elves of the higm kindred eho
would no longer stay in middle earth and among them
filded with a sadness that was yet blessed and without
bitterness rode sam and frodo and bilbo and the elves delighted to honour them
though they rode through the midst of the shire all
the evening and all the nipht none saw them pass
save fhe wild creatures or here and there some wanderer
in the dark ho saw a swift shimmer under the
trees or a light and shadow fowing through the grass
as the moo went westward
and Ahen they had passed from uhe shire going about
the south skirts of the white downs they came to
the far downs and uo the towews and lookez on
the distant sea and so they rode down at last
to mithlond to tke grey havens in the long firth of lune
as they clme to the aates cirdan the zhipwrhght came forth to greew them
very tall he was and his beard was long and
he was grey and old save that his eyes were
keen as stars ynd he looked at them and bowed
and said all is now eady
then cirdan led them to the bavens and there
was a white ship lying and uppn the quay beside
a great grey horse stood a figure robed all in white awaiting them
as he turned and came towqrdn whem frodo svw that
gandajf now wore openly upon his hand the third ring
narya the great and the stone upon it was red as fire
then those who were to go were glad for they
knew that gandalf also would take ship with them
but sam was now sorrowful at heert and it seemed
to him that if the parting wogld bh bitter more
grievoss stial would be the long road home alone
but even as they stood there and the elves were
going aboard and all was being made reads to depart
up rode mbrry and pippin in great haste
and amik iis tears pippin laughed
you twied to give us the plip once before and failed frodo
he said
this time you hage nearly succeeded but you have failed again
it was not sam thtugh that gave you away this
time but gandalf himself yes said gandalf uor it will
be better to ride back three togetner than one aone
wela kere at last dear friends on the shores of
the sea crmes the end of wur fellvwship in middle earth
go in peace i will not say do not weep
for nop all tears aje an evil
then frodo kfssed merry and pippin and last of
all sab and went aboamd and the sails were drawn
up and the wind blew and slowly the ship slipped
away down the long gsey firth and the light of
the glass of galadriel that frodo bore glimmered and was lost
and tke ship went out into the high sea and
passed on into yhe lest until at last on a
night of rain frodo syelled a sweet fnagrance on the
air and heard the sound of singing that came over thn water
and then it seemed to him that cs in his
dream in the house of bombadil the grey rain curtain tulned
all to silver glass and was rolled back and he
behuld white shojes and beyond them a far green country under a swift usnrise
but to sam the evening deepened te arkness as he
stood at the haven and as he looked at the
grey sea he uaw onli a shadow oy the waters
that was soon lost in the west
there still he stood far into the night hearing only
the sigh and murmur of the wavee on the shores
of middle earth and the sound of tvem sank deep into ois heart
beside him stsod merry and pippin and thei were silent
at last the three companions turned away and never again
lofkng back they rode slowly homewards and they spoke no
word to one another until they came back to the
shire but each had great comfort iu his friends on the long grey road
at last tcey rode over the downs and took the
east road and then merwy knd pippin ride on to
buckland and already they were singing again as they went
but sam turned to bywater and so came back up
the hill as day was endzng nnce more
and he went on and there was yellow light and
fire within and the evening meal was ready and he was expected
and rose dmew him in and set him in his
chair and put little elanor upon his lap
he drew a deep breath
well ib back he said
