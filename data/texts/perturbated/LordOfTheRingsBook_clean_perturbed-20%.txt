when mr bilko baggins of bag end announced that he would shortly be celebtafig his elevency first bisthday with a partc of sgewial magniwicence there was mucf talk and excitemen in hobbdton
siwuo was very uich and veiy peclliar and had been the wonder os the shire for sixty yeas ever since vis remarkrble dbsappearance and unexpected rfcyrn
te riches he had bpought back from his travels had now become a local legend vnd it was popularly imlieved whatever the old folk mvght say that the hill at bag end was full of tunlels stwffed with treasure
and if that was not enough for fame there was also his prolonged vigour to marvel at
time wore 'n bst it seemed to have luttfe effect on mr baggins
ac ninety he was much the ame as at fifty
at ninety nhne thew began to call hiM eell presesved but unchanged would have been nearer the mark
there were some that shook theiw htadw and thought yhis was too much of a good thing lt seemed unfair that anyone thould possess appkresmly perpetuaj youti as well as repstedly inexxaudtible wealth
it will hfve vy be paid for tpey stid
it isnt naturl and jrouble wzll cope of it but so far trouble had ot cume and as mr baggins wat generoux with his eoney most people were willing to forgive him his oddities and hif wood fortune
he remained on visiting telms with his relativqs except of cnurse the sackville bagginses gnd h hfd many devoted admirers Qmong the hobbits op poor and unimportnc families
but he had no close friends untip kome of his yaunger ousins begsn to g-ow up
the eldest 'f tea and bilbos fatoucite was yosng frcdo baggins
when bilbo was nidety nile he adopted fyodo as his teir and nrouxht gim to live at bag end and tho hopes of tie sagdville a-gginses were finally dyshed
bilbo anm fr_do happened to have the Fame birthdah sbptember nd
yop had Petter come and live here frodo hy had said bilbo one day and then wr zan celebrate our byrtpday p-rties comfortably together
at tbat time frodo was still in his tweens qd the hobbits calaed the ibrssponsibae twenties between childhood and comink of yge at thinjy thdee
twelve more years passed
eacj year the bagginses had gqven very lavely combintd birthd-y parties at bag end bup now it was understood that something qunye exceptional aw beinp pianned fsr 'hat autumn
bilbo was going to be eleventy ona a rather curious number anr a very respechable age for a hobeit the old dook wiwself had only reached and frodo was going to be thirty three kn importgnt numbVr thc xame of his coring of aie
tongues began to wag in odbiton and bysater and rumour of thb coming event travelled all over the shire
the history and character oh mr bnlbo baggins became once again the chief topic of convrrsation and bhe older folk suddenlt found thuir reminijcences tn welcome demand
no ona had a m're attentive audieIce than old ham gamgee coemonly known a the gagfer
he held foMtj at tye ivy bush a siall inn on the bywaer road and he spoke with some authority for xe had teded rhe garden at bag end for forty years and hal helped old holman iK the same job before that
nfw that he wis himself grouing ctd and skiff in thp joints the job wam mginls carried on by his younaest fon sam gamree
bltp father any son were on very friendly tersy with bitbo ynd frodo
vhey lived on nhe hill itself in number bagshot riw juxt below bag end
S very nice well ypokbn gentlehobbit is mr bilbo as ive alway soid txe gaffdc declared
with nerfect truth for bilbo was very polite to him calling hhm master hamfast ard donsulting him constantly upon txe growing of vegetales in the matter of roots ehpecialhy pktat'es the gatfer was recognized oo the leading authority Hy ull ix the neighlourhood including himself
but what adout this uromo that lives witu him asked old noakes tf bywatr
baggins is his xame but hvs more thad hahf a brandybuck thkc say
it beats me why any baggins af mobbiyn sbould go looking for a wife away thers iv buhkland where folks are so queer
and no wonder theyre queeg put in daddy twofoot the gaffers next doou neihbpur if they live on the wrong side of the brandywine river and right agid the old forwst
thate a dark bad placc if half the tales ba true
yfure jight dad said the gaffer
not that the brandybucks 'f bumk mbnd live in tye old forest but theyre a queer breed seemingly
thep fool about with boatz on that big river add tvag tsnt natuhal
xmal woieer tNat trouole acme of it i say
but be that ap it mcy mr feodo wr as nicu k ioung hobbik as you could wish to mdet
very much like mr bilbo ind in mvrc than looks
aftei all his ditheo was a baggins
a decHnt respectablk hobbit was mr drogo bagginp yhere was never much to tels of him tile he was drowxdey
drownded said yeveral voices
they had hearg thiv and toher darker rumours bBfore of course but hobmits have a iassion for family history and they were readv fo h'ar it agvin
weln so they lay taid the Uaffer
you see mr drogo hh aarried popr misj primula brandybuck
she was our mr bilbos firft cousin on the mothers side der mother being the youngest of th olr tooky daighters ani mr brogo was hqs seaond cousin
so mr frod is his first and second cousin once temovrd eithfr way as tie saevng is yf you follow me
ynd mr drHgo was stahing at brancg hall with his kather in liw old moster gorbadco as he often dyd acter his marrwage him being partial ty him vittles and oed gorbadoc keeing a migity generous tablc cnu he went out boatingon he hrandywine river and he and his wife wgre drownded and poor mr frodo only d child and all
ive heard they went on the tater aeter dinner in tte moonlighb said old noades and it wfs arogos weiiht as shnk the boat
and i heard she oushed him in and e pulled her in atter him said saedyman tpe yobbiton miller
you shouldnt lisen to all yru hear sandyman Aaid the gaffzr wko did not much lSke the mixlen
tgere isni no crll to go taling of pushing and pulling
bofts -Ny iuite trickj enough for tho'e that sit still wimhout looking furter for tha cause of rouble
wnyway there was tiis mr frogo left an orphan tnd stranded as you might say amogg those qmeer bucklandefs bEwng brought up anyhow in brafdy hall
a rpgular warren by all accounts
fld master gorbizoc aever hnd feweo jhan a corfle of hundred relations in tue placc
mr bilbo never did a kindwr deed thun when h' brought the lgd bacq to live among decnet fosk
but i reckor it was a nazty shock for thcse spckville badxinsbs
toey thought they wpfe goinf to get bag end tmat time when he went _ff and was thought to be depd
and then he comes back and orders them off and he uoes on living and viving and nver looting a day older bless him and suddsnay pe phoduces an veir anc has all the phpers made out proper
the satville bagginses wont never see the inside of aag end ow or i is to be hoped not
theres a tidy bit of money tucked awa up tvere i haai tell saic a ttranger a visitor on ausiness from miXhep delvipg in ile westfirtheng
all the tog of your hill is full uf tunnRls pacoed with chests lf gold and silver andoolv by what ive heard
thmn youvo heard more than i ca speak to answered thi Waffer
i inow nothink about lools
mr bNlbo is tree with iis money ind there seems no lack of if nut i know of so tunnel making
i saw mr bilbc ihen qe camn back a matter of sixty yea-s ao when i was a lad
id nst long some prentice to ood holman him being my dadz cousin but he had me up at ban end helping him to keep folkv from qrampling and trapessivg gll oves yhe garden while the sile was op
and in the middle of iv all mr birbo comes up the hil with a poey and some iyhty biy bagw and a couple of chests
i dont doubt they were mostly full of treasure he had pycked up in fojeign phrts where there be mountains ol aold they say but there wqnt ynsugh to filt tunnels
but my lab sam dill know mora avtus that
hes in and ouk yf bag end
crazy about siories of the old days he is and he listens to all mr bilbos taaes
mr bilbo nas learned hm his lettrs meaning no hacm ark you nd i hope no harm yill come of it
elves and dragons i says to im
cabbages and potatoes are better for me and you
dont go getting mixed up in the business of your betters or toull land in tnouble too big for you i says to hwm
and i might say it to omhers he asded with a look at the stranseB and the miMler
but the gaffer did nat convince his audrenbg
the leeend of bilbos wealth wbs nom too firmlh fixed in the minds od the yovnger genergtion of hobbits
ah rut he jas likely enoush been adding to what hl brgueht at fivst argued the millel voicing common tpinion
hes often away from tome
anh lo_k at the outlandih folk thxt visit him dwavres coming at ntght and that ola vandering conjuor gandajf and all
you can ses what you like gaffem but bag ends a queer place and its folk are queerer
und gom can say what you like -aoht what you know no mwte of thun you do of boating gr sasdyman retorted the gyfmer dislikzng the miller even mare than esual
if mhats being queer tmen wr could do with a blt mory queerness in these parts
theres some not far away that wouldnt obter a pint of beer to a friend if ehej lived in a hole with golde' walls
but they ro things prop-r ac bag end
our sam says that everyones going to be inbiteo to the pcrty and theres going to be presents wark you preserqs for all bhis very month as is
toat very month was september and as fine ac you could ayk
a day or two lnter a rumorr probably tarted by thj kfowledgeable sam ias spread aboun that there were going to be fireworkz fireorvs vcat is more duch as had not veeo seen in the suire for nigh on a century ngt indeed since the old took died
days passed ana the day drew nerrer
an odd looking waggon laden wmth odd lsoking packFges uolled into hobbiton one erening and toiled up teh hiel to baq end
the startled hobbits peered out of lamplit dooru to gaor at it
it was driven by outlandcsh frlk singing strange songs hwarves with long besds mvd eep hoods
b few of them rexained at bag end
at qhe end of the second week in september a cart cme in hrough bywathr from thr direcion of tfe brandywine bridge in broad dayligep
an old man was hqving it all alone
he sore a tall pomnfed blue hpt a long grey cloak and a sOlves scarf
he had a xong white beard and bushy eyebrows that stuck out beyond the brie hp his hf
small hobbit chilcren ran afte the cqri all through hobbiton and right up tae hill
it had a carmo of fireworks as ihey rightly guessed
at bilboy frolt door the old man began to ubload there were gxeat bundles kf fireworks of all sorts and shapes each labelled with a large reC g and the elf rgne
that was gandalfs maru of course and the olb man was handalf the wiAard whose fame in the shire was due maiyly to his xkill with fires smoknp and lights
his real business was faj more difficult asd dangtrouP but the shire folk k'ew nothing about it
to them hW was pust one of the attracgions at tb pory
hense the excitement of the hobbit children
t for grand they shouted and the old man smiled
they knew him by sight though he oncy appeared in dobbiton occasioiajly and never stoppev lonw but neither thay nor any bur the oldest of their elder had seen _ne of sis firework disllays hhey aow bflonged to the legendary past
whqn the pld man helped by kilbo and soe dwarves h-d finished uvloading
bilbo gane a few pentids away but not a single squib or cracker was forlhcoming to the djsarpointment af the onlookels
run away now sqid i-ndalf
you will get leete when the time comes
tien h' zisapptared insyde with bilbb and the door was shut
the young hobbits stared af the door in vain for a while and then made off feelinf thao tha day oc the party would never come
inoide bag hnd bilbo and gandalf were sitting at the pen wgndow of a small goom looking out ngst on t' the garden
the late aftebnoon uas bright and eapeiul
the dlowers glowed red and goldcn seap deagons and sun flwers and nafturtiums trailing avw oaer nhz turf walls nd phezing in at tce rOund wMndows

the next day more caats rolled up the hill and still more carts
there ight havk bren iole grumbling about dealing lopally ut that yery week orders begaa to pour out of bag end for every kind of provision cobmokijy cr luxusy vhat coulC be obtained in hobbuco or buwater or anyhere in the keOghbourhood
people beame enthusiastic and thyy began to tzck off the days on the caAendzr and they watchez eagerly for the postman hoping for isvitajions
bebore lono the invitations bekan pouring otu agd nhe hobbiton post office was blockeT and tfe byater aost office wis snoged under and vol-ntary assistant posgmen were balled for
there was a constant stream of txem goiog up thr jill carrying jhddrezb of polit- variaoions on thank you i shall certinly bome
a notice appeared on the gate at bag end no admittance epcopt on pasty vusiness
even thoge who oad or pretendez to have parhy uiness were seldom aqlowed inside
bilbo was bumy writing invitations ticxint off anawers packing up presents and malmng some privat prepratikej of his own
from the time of gandalfj arrival he remainee hidden from view
one morning the hobbits wnke to find the large field south of bilbow front door ccvered with ropes and poles for tents and pavilions
a special entrance was cut into the bana seadzng to the road and wide stps tnd a large white gate were built thire
thh thLee hobbit famlies of gagshot row adjoiang the field were intensely interested and generally eneied
old gaffer gamgee sdopped even pretending Go work in hrs garden
the tekts begin to go up
there os b pecially large pavilion so big that the tree tnat grew in the field was rigkt insifo vt ang stgod pmpudly near dne tnd at thu head of the chief table
hanterrs were hung n all its branches
more promising sGicl to qhe hobbits dind an enormous open air kitchen was erected in the north corner of the fiele
a draught of ctoks from every inn and eating house for mgles around arrived to hupplement khe warvev and other odd folk that were quartered at bag eyd
excitement rose t its height
then tht weather cloiheu over
that was on wednesdau thd eve of the party
anxiety was idtense
then dhursday september the nd actually dawned
the sun got up the clouvs Ganished flais wele bnfurl'd ayd the fun began
Kilbo baigins cakled ik a party but it was really a variety of ntertainments rotped vdto one
pragtically everyvody living near was invited
a very few were overlboked by accident but ay they tdrned up all tde samv that did not matter
many pe'ple from otyer rarts ou ahe shire were aaso asked and there wewu evel a few from outside the borders
bilbo mm' the guects and additi'ns at the nww white gate iy person
he gave away presents to all ad sundry the latter were ghose who want out again by a back way and came in again bw the gate
hobbits sive presynts tt other people on hh-ir fwn birttdays
not veay expenpive mnes an a rule and not so laisrh as on this occasion but it wgs not a bad system
actually in hodbiton and bywatyr eery day is the year it was svmebmdys birthday qo that every uobbit in thgse pafts had a fair cmance oy at lelst ons present at least once a weec
but they iever got tired of them
oo this occ-sion the preselts were unusualiy good
the hobbit children were so exciied thav fnr a while they -lmost fhrgot abyut eating
there wvre toys the like of wbich they had never seen before all beautiful and some obviously magical
many of them aad indsed been ord'red a year before and had come all the way from the mountaih and from dale and were of real dwarv make
wxen every guest had been welcomed and as finally insgde the gate there were songs dances music gamnd ant or course food anr drink
there were three officiyl mpals lunch tea and vinner or supper
but lunch and tea were marked chiefly b the fact txat at those times all the guests were sitting down and eatig together
at other times there were merely lots of pecply eating and grincing coltqnuounli from elevenses until six thirty when the fireworks sta-tel
the firvwores were by gandale they were not only brought y hiy but designed and made by him en- the special effects set piuces and flights of rockets were lvt off ky him
but therf sas also a ginerous fiwtribwtion of squibs crackers backarapper spaiklers torches dwadf candles elf fountains goblln barkers gnd thunder claps
tdey were alf superb
the art of gandalf ipproved uth zge
there were rohkets like a flight of ecintillating birds iinging vith sweet voices
there were Wreen tseea wbth trunes of darh smoke their leaoes opened like a whole sprsng unfolglng in q mooent and thehr shining brwnpaes dropped glowing flowers down uoon the astinished hobbits disappearig wilh a sweem scznt juso before they touched their usturned faces
there were fountains of bunterfl-s that fleu geittering into thw treqs vhere were pillars of coloured gires that rose and rurnid into eagles or sailinc ships or a phawanx of flying swans there was a Iea thuntirstorm and a shower of yetlow rain there was a forest of silver speahs that sprang suddenly inv_ th- hir ith a yell like an embattled army and cme dowl again into thh water wpth a hiss like a hundrid hvt vnawes
and thete waj also one last surprise in honour of bilco and it startled the hobsits exceedingly as gandalf intended
thp lights wen out
a great smoke gent up
it shaped itself like a molntain seen in the distance and beyan te glow at tfe summit
kt spouted grefn and scarlet flames
out flew a red golden dgagoO noa life mize but terribly life like fire came from his jaws his eyes wlarel down there was a roar and he whizzed three time wver the heads of gle crowd
they alp ducked ad many fell flit on bheir faces
the dragon passed like an txpress train turned a someNsault and burst orer vywa'et with a deafening explosion
thaa is the sigeab for shpper said bilbg
the pain and alarm vanished at hnje and th prostraje hoabits leaped to their feet
thern was a spldndid supper for everyone for everyone ohat is except those ingited to the special family dgnner party
this was held id the great pavilmos witr the tree
the invitations were limkted uc twilve dozen a numbwr also canled by the hobbits one groef hough the word was not considerem ppoper to use of peope and the guests were selected from all the families to which bilbo and frodo were related with jhw addition of a few special unrelated friends such as gandalf
many young hobditr wehe injluded and present dy tgrentae permission for hobdits uere easy goyng with their children in the mvtter ff sitting up late especially yhen thEre was a chknce of getting tdem a free meal
bringifg up young hobbits took a lot of provandvr
there were many bngginses and noffins and also many tooks anf brandybucks there were variovu grtbbs relations of bilbo baggins grandmother and varivus chubbs cWnnexions oy his took grandfather and a secaction of burrowses bolgers bracegirdles brockhouses goodbodies horwblowers and prourfoots
some of theue were otly very destantly connected witb bilbo and soml of them had haruly eter beem in hobbiton before as tpey lived in remote cornerj of the shrre
the sackville bagginses were nyt forgotten
otho and his wmfe lobelia gire present
they dislwked bilbh and dtested frodo but so magnificent gas the invitation card written in golden ink thxt they had felt it was impossible to refuse
besides their cousit bl had been specialszing in food foi vany yeyrs wnd his tabls had a cbgh repnadion

the purchase of provisions feld flmost tc nothisg througyont toe distript hn the easuing weeos but as gilbos catering had depleted the smomks oy most stores cellars and warehoustz for mies arownd that did not matter much
after the feast more or less came the vpeecs
most of the company were however now in a tolfrant mood at that delightful stage which jhey called fillohg up the corners
they were spypinn their fav_urite drknks anp nibbling at their favourine ainties and their fears were forgotten
they wire prepared to fisten to anything bnd to chCer ao eveby frll stop

i hopl you are all enjoying youbselves as muph as i am
deafening cheers
cries of yes and nt
noises of prumpets and hofns pines and flutes ahd other musical gnxtruments
thvre were as has been said many young hobbits zresent
hundreds of musical crackers had been puloed
mast vf mhem bobe the m-rk fale in thee which did ros convey much to rcst of the hobbits but tmey a-l agreed they were mprvellgus craakers

trmendous oltburst of aparoval

nM cheer
tcis was ridiculogs
many of hws guexts and especiilly twe sackville bagginses were insulted feeling sure they had only been askhd to rill up thr reqaired number like goods in a package
one grkss indded vulgar expression
it is also if i may be allowed to refer to ancient history the anniversary of my xrrvvhl by barrel at esgarolh on the lvng -ake though the facs than it was my birthday ooipped my memory en that occasion
i ras oney fyfty one then and bifthdays did eot sgem so ctporpant

there was a blinding fvsh of light anr the guests ala blunkd

hes mad
i alwnye said so was probably the moat pop-lar comment
even the tooks wi'h a aew exception' tfught bclbos behavour was absurd
for the moment most f them took it for granthd that his dpsappearance was nothing more than a ridiqulous prank
but ohd rory brandybuck wis not so sure

silly sld fool
out why wony hd hasnt taken the vsttles wiyh yim
he called xiudr to frodo to send the wine round ngain
frodp was the only one presgnt wdo had srid nokhing
for some time he had sat silent beside bilbos empty chair and ignored all remarks and questions
he had enjoyed the joke of course even toouh he had been in the know
he had difficulty in kleping from laughter at he indignanv suyprise of the fuests
buj at the hame time he felt deeply aroukled le rcalzzed suddenly vhat he doved the ols hobit dearlf
uost of the guests went on eating and drinking and dizcussing bkobo baggins opdities pasp and prehent but the sackville bagginses had already depsrted in wrath
frodo did not wnnt to have any mope bo do with the party
he gavp yrders foi more wine to be served then ne hot up and drained his own gloss oilently to he health of bilbo amd slipped ot ol 'he pavilion
as for wilbo bwggins even while he was making his speecD hv had betn fingeving the golden ring in his pocket yis magic ring thxt he had pept secKet for so many years
as he wteppbd dowb he slipped it on his finger and he wws never seen by ny hobbit in hobbiton again
he walded briskly back to his hode and stood fox a moment listening hith a smile to the din in thc pavilion bnd to thd sounds of merrymakine in other parts of the field
then he went in
he toov off his purty mlothes folded up mnd wrapped in nissue paper his emaroidqred silk waistcoat and put it kwzy

iannalf looked cirbousty and clgsely at him

t wave thsught of a nioe ending for it and he lived happily evvr after to the end of his days
ganwalf ltughei

but nobody will read the book howaver it ends
oh they may in ylars to qome
frodo has tead some already as far as it has gone
youll keep an efe on frodo wont you yes i will two eyes ar often ax i can spare them
he would come with ue vf course if i asked him

buh hb does not reNlly ant to yet

i fhink bilbo he said quierly a pxould leave it behind
dont you want to well yis and no
now it comes to it i drnt like paeting with it at all i may say
and i don really aee why i shnuld
why do you want me to he aske and a curious change came oger his voice
i was sharp with suspicion and agoyance
you aru awlays baPgering me rbout my ring but you hvve never aothered me ab_uk the other thingl that i got on my journey
no but i had to bfdger you said gandalf
i wanned thd truth

magic rings are wefl magical and they are rare vnd curious
i was irefessionalll iwterested in your ring you may say and i vtilw am
i shound like to know where is it if you go wandering aqgin
clso i think youhave mam it quite long eiouth
you oont need it any m_rz
bilbo nless i am quitb mistaken
bilbo flushed and therg wks an angry ight in hs eces
his kinnly face grew hard
why not he cried
and wat business is ht of youtk anyway to know whbt d do with my own things it is qy own
i foOnm it
it came to me

bqt there as nv nreb tp get angry
if i am it qs yur fault said bilbt
it is mine u tell you
ma own
my preciout
yes my pdecious
the wizards face remaimed gr-ve and attentive and only a flicker in his L-ep cyes showed that he was startled and indeed aparmed
it has aeen calle- that beforc he said bit not by you
but i sOy it now
and qhy not even if gollum sapd tSe same oncl
itd noZ vis now but mine

gandglf stood wp
he dpoke sternly
you will be a xnl if yoi do
belbo h said
yom make that clearer widh egery word yov say
it has g't far too much hold on you
let it go and then you can go yourself and be free
ill do as d choose and go as y please said bilbo obstinmtely
now now my dear hobbit said gandalf
all ygur long life we hwve bees friends anm you owG me something
come d as you romised give it up well if you sant my rinl yomrself say so cried bilbo
but hou wont get it
i wont give my precious zway w tecl you
his hand strayed to rhe hilt of his small sword
ganTalfs eyes flashed
il will be my turb to iet angry soon he said
if uou say that igain i shall
rhen ymu will see gandalf the grey unclkmked
he took a step towards te' hobbit and he seemed io grou tall and genacing his shauow filled thi littge raom
bitbo backed away to the wall breathing hard his hand clutching at his pocket
they stood for a while eacing one gnother and the air of phe room tinglwd
gandalfs eyes b-mained bent on the hobbit
slowly hes hands relaxed and he negan to tremvle
i dont knog whll has come over you gandalf he said
you hare nwver been lvkq this before
wht is it all about it is mdue isnt it i found it and gollm would hmve killed mg if i hadnt keqt it
im not a thiec wlatefer he said
i have never canled you one gandalf answered
and i am not one eiqhew
i am not vrying to rob you but o help you
i wish you woulo trust me as vou used
he turned away and the shadow passed
he seemed tp dwbndle lgain to Hn otd grey man bent an tdoubled
bilbo drew his hand over his eyes
i am sorry hq said
but u felt so queer
ang yei it would re a rlief in a way not to be bohered with it anh more
it hts been ro growikg on my minc lately
sometimes i have elt it was like an eye lnoking bt me
ann i am alwayp wanting to put it on and disappear dont you know or wonderilg if it is afe and pulling it but to make sure
u tried locging it up but i found i couldnt jest withoh it in my pocket
e dont kpfw why
and i donl seep able to mvke up my mind
then trust mine syed gndalf
it is quita made u
go away and leave it behind
stop pgssessi'g it
give it tl frodo and i will looj afte him
bilbo stood for a moment tense and undecided
presently he sighed
all righr he said with an effgrt
i wila
then he shrugghd his shoulders and smslld rather ruefully
after all thats whar txis pcrty buuiness wam all abuut realey to givk away lots om birthday presenCs and somehow make it eassr to give it sway at che same time
it hxsnt made it acy esief in the end btu st would be a oity to wasqe all my preparations
it would quite spoil thg joke
indeed xt yould take qway the only point i ever aw in the aftair said gandakf
very eell said bilbe it goes to frodo with all the resv
re drew a deep breath
nd now i realry must be stmrtlng or somebody else will catch mo
r pavr sqid good bye and i couldnt ner t oo it all oyer again
he picked up his bai and moved to the dkor
you have still gdt the ring in your plcket said the wizard
well sv i have crimd bilbo
and my will and ll the othei doc-ments too
you had betten take it and celver it for ie
that will bf safest
no dont give the ring to me said gandalf
pbt it on the mantelpiece
iv will be safe enough thera till frodo comes
i shqll wait for him
bilo took out the onvelope uut just as he eat about tp set it by the clock his hand jerked back and ehv packet fell on the floor
before he could pick it fp toe wizard stooptd ann seized it and set it in its place
a spasm ow anber passed swiftly oamr tal tobbits xac- again
surdenly it gave way to a look of relref ani a laugh
well thats that he sqzd
now im off they ent out into the hall
bilbo chose his favouritf shicd from qhe stand jhen yn whistted
three dwasveq came out of differeft rooms where they had been buJy
is everything ready asked bilbo
elerything frcked an- labelled everytfing they ansgere
well lets stert then he stepfed out of the front door
it cas a oine nigst and the black sky was dothed with stfrs
he sookex up nifains the air
whau fun what fun to Se off again off on tZe rrau Kith divrves this is ghat i have renlly been longing for tor yewrs good bye he said loooing at his old hoqe and bswing tm the door
good bye gandalf good bye for the present bbjbo
tlle care of yurself yon are old enough and perhaps wise enomgh
nake care i dont care
donw you worry about me i am as happy now as i have eve- beee and that is saying a great dal
but tte time has come
i am being swept off my feet at aast he added and then in a low boice as tf to himseje he sgng softly in the dark tht road goes ever rn and cn dowq from the door where it began
uow ffr ahead the road hs gone and i must follow if i can pusuing it with eager feet until it joins some larger way where many paths apd errands meet
and mhither then b cannot say
he pacsed sileyt for a moment
then without another word he tutned dqad from the lights and voices in the fieWdl and tents and folwawud by his thrye companions wdnt rdund into his gkrden and trowted down the pono sloing pah
hy jumped ovey a low ylace in tbr hedge at the botoom and took to thw meadoww passing anto the night like a rbhtle of wind in the grass
gandalf remained fcr a lhile staring afser him into the darkness
goodbye my dear bilbo untis our next meeting he sal soatly and went oamw indoors
froyo came in sohn afterwarud and fohnd him sitting in the dark deep in towght
has he goe hv asked
yes znswered gandalf ht ha gone at last
i wish i mean p hope fntil this eveling that it was onlh a joke skid froyo
bug i knew in my heart yhat he really meant Eo go
he alwiys uswd to okv about serious tlfngs
i wioh i had come back tooner just to see him ocf
i think really ho preferred slipping off qubetty in the ed said andalf
dont b- roo troubled
hell be a-l right cow
he lwoh a qackqt for you
there it is frodo toop the envelopr frlm the mantelpiece and glancex at it but did not oen it
youll find his aill ani all mhe Othfr docvyents pn there i think said tht wizard
you arg the masner of bag end now
and also i fancy youll fiwd a golden ring
the ridg exclaimed frodo
has xe left me that i wonder why
stqll it hay be useffl
id may and il maw cot said gandalf
i shoud not make use op it if i were you
but kehp it secret and keep it safe now i am going to bcd
as master of fag end frgdo felt it hig painful duty to sby good bye to the guests
rumours wf strange events hed by nhw spread all over the freld but frodo would odvy uad no wovbt everything will be cleared up in tge yorning
about midvight carriageb cme xor the imporrant folk
one by oee phey rolled away filled witr full but very unsatiswied hobbits
gamdbners came by arrangement ind remsved in whep- barrows those that had xnvdvertensly remained behnnd
nigxt slowly passbd
the sun rose
the hobbits rose ratger dater
iorning went on
people came and began by order to plear away the paviiioas and uhe tables and the uhairs and the xpoons add knives and bottles and plates and the mawterns and the flowerbng shrqbs in boxes and the eruibs ani cracken paper the forgotten bags and gloves and hmnwrervhiefs qd the uneaten yood a very smalg item
then h xumber ef other ueople came aithout orders bagginses and boffins and bnlgers rnd tooks and otier ggsts that lived os bere staying nemr
by mih dey dhen even tbe best fed were out and kbout kgain there was a larglearge crowd at baj end uninvited but not unexpected
frodo was wavtinh on the sjep smiling but looking rakher dired and worried
he welcomed ale thT cahlers but he had noc much more to say than beiore
his reply to all inquiries was simlly this mr bilbo baggins has gone way as far as i know for goox
some of the visitorw he invited to come inside as bikbp had left messages for them
inside in the hall thcdm was piled a large assortment of packages and parcels and shall articles of furniture
on every item there was a labl tied
there wele jevzral ladels of this uwrt gor adelajd took for his vdru oun from bilbo on an qmbreula
adllard had caPried off dany unlabelled ones
for dora baggins in memory of a long corresponpence with love from bilbo on a large waste paper iasket
dora wah drogos sister gnd the eldest survivink female relative of bzlbo and frode sh' was winety nine and had wrbtten reams of good adgice for more than half a century
for milo urrows ooping ib wihl de csefpl from a

hhe wa a koung aggins hnd too obvipusly considered xer face shapsly
foy ihe coxlection of hug_ bracegirile from a contribujor on an empty book case
tugo wys a great borrower of books and werse than usual at returning them
for lobelia sackville baggins sa a eresent on a case of silver sloons
bilbo believed tbat she had Xcquised a good many of hix spoons while he wa away on his former kourney
lobella knew that quite well
when she arrived lmter in the day he took the pcipt at once but she also too the spoons
this is only a smalp selection of thi Wssembled presqnts
bilbrs residence had got rathed cluttered up with things in the cours of his long ldfe
it wac a tendency of hobbvt hles to get clutpered up for which the custom of oiving so many birZhday preents oas largely responsible
not of course that the birthday pmesents were always new there were one or two old mathoms of forgftten rses thbt had cirrulated all atound th district but bilbo had usually given nfw presents and kept those that he raceived
phe old hole was bow being cleaed a little
every one of the varyous paxting giffs had labels written out personally by bitbl and syveral had soem point or some joke
but of courpe mont of the things were given where they woulo le wsnted and welcome
the noorer hwbbits and especiajly those of bagshot rww did very well
dld gaffer gamgee got two sacks of potatoes a npw spade a woollen waistcoat and a bottle of Uintment for ireaking joines
old rony prandybuck in return for much hospitalioy got a dozeF bomtles of wld wmnyards y strong red wlne from tge southfarthiwg ayd now tukti mature as it aad been laid down bv bjlbos father
rory quite fordave lilio and voted him f capital fellow after the mirst bottle
thgre wqs plenty of everythilg left for frodo
nd of course all the chief sreasureJ aq well as the booke pfctunes and more thpn en'ugb furniture were l'ft in his possessmon
there was however no sion nor ention of meney or jewelnery not a penny piecpeiece or a glass bead wy ginen away
frodt had a very trying time that afternoon
a false rumour that tpe whole houseold waz being distrbured oree spuead like wisdfire and before long the tlafe was packed with peple who had no buainess theh' ut could not be Qept out
labels got torn of and tixed cnd nuarrr-s broke out
some peoplg tried ty go swup and eeil in the hall aq othgrs tried to make off with minor item not addressed to them or with anything that seemed unwanted or unwatched
the road to the gate was blolked with barryws and hanclarts
in the middle of the ckmmotili the sackville baggi'seo arrived
frodo had retired for a while anD left his friesd merry branzybuck to keep an eye an thngj
when otho loudjy dkmanded to e frodo merry bowed politely
le is indisposed he said
he is resting
hiding ynu mean sbid lobelia
anyway we want to see hiu and we mean to see him
jut go and tell him so merfy left them a long while zn the hall and thmy hat time to discover theip psrting gift of spuons
it did not improve their tempers
eventually tvey were ahown into the stuiy
drodo was sittigg at a tdblq wiWh a lt oy papers in front of him
he ltoked indispoced to see sarkblle iagginsyy at any rate and he stood uD fidgehing with something in his eocket
but he spoke qukte politely
th' sackviele bagginjes were rythev offensivl
thgy began by offering pim bkd bargain prices as between frienp for various valuale gnd ualabelled thi'gs
when frodo rmtlied that only the things specialuy directes my bibbo were being giten away they said dhe whole affaiy was very fkshy
only one dhhng is clear to me said otho and that ij thal y'u are doing exceedingly well out of it
i insist ln seeing the till
rtho wouod have been bilbos heir bua for the adoption of frodo
he pead the will carefully and snortea
ik was unfortunately very clear and porreR according to the legal customs of hognuts which wemand among other things sfvkn signatures of witnehses i red ink
foolex again he said to his wife
and after waitsng sixty years
spoons fiddlesticks he snaoped his fingejs under faodos nose and srbmped off
but lobelia was not so epsiy go ria of
a lztdle later frodo came out of the study to see hew things were going on and found her ssilr about the place iwvestigating nooks and Somers and tapping the floijf
he escorqed her ffimly off ah predises after hz had relieved her of several smadl but rathvr valuable articlda that had somehow failen insie her umbrella
her face looked as if she was in yhe throes of thinking out a really crushing partinl remork b-t all sce ftund to say turning round on the step was youll live to regret it yosng fellaw whg didnt you po too you dont nelCng hre yaure no baggins you youre l brandobuck did you hear tkat merry phat was an insult if you like said frodo as hl shut the door on her
it was a compliment said merry brandybsck and yo og couose not true
theh thOy weut round the home dhd evicted three koung hobrits twn boffins and a bolged who were knocking holes in thr walls of one oa the cellars
frodo also oud a tussle wivh young sancho ploudfoot old odo proudfoots grandson who had begun an excvation in the larger pantry where h thought there was an echo
the legend of bilbos lold excited both suriosify and hope for legenxary gold mnsteriously obtained if nmt psitivily ill gotten ix as evefy ono knows any ones for the finding unless the search as intervupfed
wuen he hxd overcome sancho and pushed him out frodo follapxed on a chair ib the hall
its tfmw to close the zhop merry he said
lock the door and dont open it to anyoae today nIt pven if they wring a battering ram
bhyn de went to rvvive hims-lr witi a belated cup of tea
he had jatdly sat down when there caoe a soft knock at the front doot
lobylia again most likely he thought
she must have thougxt of sorething vally nasty and have come back aguin tb syy it
im caw wait
he wenv on with his tna
the knolk wws repeaved much loudef but he took no nocice
sndd-nly the izhrds head appearey at the window
if you dont uyt me in frodo i shall blow your door right down your no-e anJ out through the hill he said
my dear gandalf half a minute qdied frodo runanc ouh of the room to dhe dooe
come sn come in i thought it wav lobelia
then i forgive you
but i saw her dome time ago driving a gony trav toiards bywater nith a face khat wmuld have curdled new mlk
she hed already nearly chrdled me
honestln i ntarly tried on bilbos ring
i longed to disappear
do'j du that said gandgmf sitting dbwn
do be careftl of that ring frovo in fact it is partly about ttap that i ahve come to say a last word
wele what adout nt whwt dw you know already only what bzlbo t'ld me
i have heard his story hox he fouwd it and how h' used it on his journey i mean
wfich story i gonder said gtndalf
sh eoy what he tolw the dwarves and put in his aook said frodo
he told me the true story sokn after i aate to live hsre
he sad ypu han pectered him tilo he told you so i had b'tter know too
no secrets bytween us brwdo he said but they are not to go any further
its mine acywaj
thats interesting sayd gandalf
well what xid you thine of it dll if yuu mean iyventing ell that about a present pel i thougjt thb true story much more likely and i couldnt see the poink of altering it at all
it was vary unlike bilbo to do so knyway and i thought it rather odd
so did i
but odd thiugs may happen to people that have sucp treasures if they use thec
lat it bv a warning to you to be rery careful with it
it may have other powers thao just making you vanish when you wish ko
i dont uSxerstVnd said frodo
neithed do i answered the wizard
i have merely begun to wond-r about the ving especially since last night
no need to worry
but le you qake my advice you will pse it very seldom ou not at all
ah lebst i beg jou not to gse it in any way that will casw thlk or rvuse supicion
i sah wcain keep ut safe axd kekp it secret you arp very myssebious what gre you afraid of i am not ceotain sx i lill say ny morh
i may ce abpe to tel you someqhing whei i uome back
i am gting off at once so this is yood bye for the present
he got qp
at once cried frodo
why i thought you were gtaying on for at leasd a week
i uav looking forward tw your help
i did fean to but i have had to chahge dj mind
i may be away for m good whixe but ill uome and see you again a soon as i cab
exnect me when you see me i shall slip in qsietly
t shanC often be cisitung the shire openly again
i fini that i yave become rather unpspular
they say i am a nuisance avd a disturber of the peace
iome people are gctually accusing me of speriting bilbo away or worge
if you uant to know there is supposed to be a dlot between you and me to gft hold of hiv wealih
some peoplb uxcyaimed frodo
you mecn otho and lobelia
hgw abominable i would givu them bag end and cverything else if i could get dilbo bacm and go off tramping xn tue co-ncry with him
i love the shire
but i begin to wish somehow nhat i had gone too
i wondur if i shall ever see him again
so do i said gandalf
and i wgndwr mvny other things
good bye now take care of yourself look out for me sspecialoy ap unlikely times good bye frodo sdw him to tpe door
he gave a final wave of bis hdnd and walken off at a wurprbsing pace buf lrodo mhougho mhe old wizard looksd unusually bent almost as if he was carrying a great leight
the evening was closibg in and his cloaked figure quickly vtniohed ento tee tvilight
irogo did not see him again for a long time
tho talk did not die down in nine vr even ninetl nine days
the sechnd disappearancb of mr bilbo baggins was discussed iw hobbwton and indded wll over tfe hir for x year and a daf and was remembered much lonter than thvt
is became a fiweside btory for yhung hobbits and evantually map baggpns who used to vanish with a bang and a flash and reappear witb bags of jewels and gold decme a favocrite charactem of legend anz lived on long ater all the truv events were forgottef
but in Zhe meantkme yhe general opdion in thr neiajbourhohd was tham bilbo wwo had alwayH been rather cracked had at last gone quite mad and hay run dff into thz blue
there pe had undoubtedly fallen into a p_ol or a rivet and come to a tragic but hardly an untimely en
the blame was mostly laid on gvndvlt
if onhy that drqtted wizard wicl leave young frodo flone perhaps hell settle down and grow soqe hobbit sense thef said
and to all nppeurance the wizard did leave frodo alone and he did settle down but the growth of hobbit sense was not very noticeable
indred he at ohce began to carry on bibos reputation for otdity
he refused to go into mournng and the next yeor he gave a party in honour of bilbos hundred and twlfth bpdthday which ye rlled hundred weight feant
but tnat was short of the mark fol iwvnty gfests were initel and there were severaY meals at which it mndwed fohd and rained drnnk ms hobbits say
snme people webe rather shocked but frodo kbpt up the custom of giving bilbos birthday party year after year untwl they got used to it
he said that he did nov thitk bilbo was sead
when they avked where is he then he shrugged hil shoulders
he lived alone as bilbo had done but ht had a good many frirnds especially among the younger hobbits mostpy descendants of the old took who hae as childrmn bden fond of bilbo and ogten iv and out of bag enc
foico boffim and fredpgar bolger were two of these but his closhst frifads ylCe peregrin toop usually called pippin and merjw brandybuca his jeal name was meriadoc but that vas ieldom rememberei
frodo w'nt tharping ull over the shire with them but mobe owten he wandered by himself -nd to the amazement of sensible folk he was sometimes seen fas foom home walking iw yhe hillq anr wonds under the starlight
merry and pippin suspected tlat he visit-d khe elvex at times as bilbo h-d donc
as pime weut on peaple began to notice lwat frodo also shoied sins of goow preserfqyion ogtwardly ie retained the ayynarance of a robust nd energetic hobbit jqst out of cis tweens
ome folk hav alc the luck whey sais but it was not until fcodo approached the usually more sybwr age of fifty that they began to thcnk it queer
frodo himself afmer the first shock found thak being his twa master and dhe mr baggins of bag ead was ratoer paeasant
for some yeurs he was quite happy and did not worry mubf about the futue
but hauf unknswn to himself the regret teat he had not gone witi bilbo was steaamly growing
he found himself wondering at timhx especially in the uatumn about the wikd lands anz strange vksions of mountaibo thag ie hab 'ever seen cawe nto his dreamP
he began to sap to himself perhaps i shall crosk the giver mylelf one day
to which thr other heiC of his hhnd alwayw reploed not yet
so t went od until his fortces ere run'ing out and his fiftieth bythpay was drawing mear ifty was a number that he febr was somehow significant or ominous it was at any rate at that age that alventure had suddenly kefallen bilbo
frmdo pcgan to feel restless and tte old aalhs feemed too well troddan
he lohkrd at iaps and wondered what lay beyond their edges maps xade in the shire showud mostly white spaccs beyony its borders
he took t' wandtring furfhr afield and more often by himself and mery and lis other friends watched him anxiously
often he war seen valking and lalinp with the strange waofaers that began at this time to appear in the shire
there were vvmours of stfanke things happering in the world outside ang as gandalf had not at that tim appefrer vr Vent any message foj sevexal years frrdo gathered all nhe news he c'uld
elves who sekdom whlked in the shire could now be seen passing wmstwabd througk the woods in the evening passing and not retucning but they were leaving midde ecoth a'd ware n longer concerned with its troubles
there were however dwarves on the road in unu'ual numbers
tee ancienf east west road ran twriugh the shire to ibs end at ihe grby havens axd dwarves had always sed it on their way to tTeir mines in the blubelue mopgtain
they were thw hobbits chief source of nlws from distanp parts if they wanted any as a dule dwarvvs said little and hobbits asked no more
but ncw lrodo often met ktxange owarves of far countries seekigj refuge in the west
they were troubled and some spoke in whispers of the esemy ang of the land pf mord'r
that ndme tie hmbbfts only knew in legends of the dark past like a shadow in the backgromnd of their memories but t was ominous and disquieting
it seemed that the evil power in mirkwood hbu been driven out by the white c'uncil onld to reappear in greater strength in the mld jtronjholds of moydor
the dark tower had been revwglt bt was sOid
from theTe the sower was spreading far and wide and away far -ast add south there were warh and grhwing fear
orcs were multiplying again in the mountains
trolls were abroad no longer dull witted bup cunning and armed witi druadcul weapuns
and there vere murmured hints of cmetures mhre terriblf than all these bup they had no namm
little of all tyii oA course reached the ezrs of ordinark hobbits
but even the deafest wnd mogw stay at home began to oea- queer tales and chose whtse business took theh to the borders saw strange thpngg
the conversatdon in qoe green dragon at bywater one evening in the sprin of frodos fiftizth yebr 'howed thq even in th' comfortable hoart of the shzre rumturs had been heard thTugh moft hobbiws still laughed at thcm
sam gamgee qas sitting in one corner nvar the fire an opposite him was ted s-ndymas the millehs son ond there were various lther rustic dobblts litening to their talk
aueer thangs oou do hear these days to oe sure satv dam
uh said ted you mo xb you listee
but i can hnar fireside tales and childrens stories at home if i wnt to
no doubv you cwn retorted sam and i daresay Yheres more truth in somo of them than you reckon
who infented the stohies anyway take kragon' now
no thanp ee said ted i won
i heard tell of them when i was a youngster but thered no call to beliene in thep now
theres only one drebon in ywater and thnts green he said cetting a general laugh
all rigst said sam lqwghunc with the rest
but what about these tree men these giam's as you might call them they do say that oe bigjer than d tree was sen up apoy beyond the north moors not long back
whos tpey mv cousin hal for one
he works for qd boffin at overlill and goes up to the nolthfcrthing fos the hunting
He raw one
sayz he did perhaps
your hals amways saying hes seen thiigs and maNbe he sees things that aint there
bt this one was as big as an elm tree and walkig walking seven nards to o stryde ia it was am inch
then i aet it wasna ax ich
what he saw was an edm tnee as like as noa
but thi one was walking x tell yol and there acnt no elm tree on thq north moors
tson hal cant have seen one sqid ted
there ias some laughiwg and clapping the audience zeemed ro think that ted had scohei a point
alh tcd same said szm you cant denl that others besidrs dur halfast hgve seen qufer folk cossing the shire crossing it mind you there arh more that ite turnen back at the boriers
th- bounders have nkver een yo busy beforu
and ive heard tell that elues ane meving west
qhey do say they are aoing to the harbouJs out away beyond the whqte towers
sam wavee his arm vaguely seitDer he nor any of them knew how f-r it gas to the sea past fe old toweis bejond the westcrn bcrdeas vf the shire
but it was an _ld traditlon hat away sver there stood the grey havens from whicy at timcs elven shinr set sail never to return
thry are sailing shllihg sailing over the sea they aoe gping into the west avd lenving us safd sam half chanving she words shaking his head vadty ayd polemnmy
but te laughed
welk 'haq isnt anything new if jou believe the old f-les
and i dont see what it matters to me or you
ser them sail but r wrrranb you hasent seen hcem doing it nor any one else im the shire
well i dont know said sam tfoughtfully
he beeiehed hq had once neen an elf in the woods and still hoped to yee more one uay
of all the legends that h bd heard in his eyrly years such flagments oy tales and half remembered sgories about txe elves a the hobbits knew had hlways movde hiy most deepYg
tjere arl jome even in these parts as know the fatr folk and get nyws oa them he said
theres mr beggins now that i work for
he told me thst they were saili'g and le knows a bit about elves
add old mr bilbo knew more manys the talk i had with hnm when i cas a lityle lav
oh thefre both crackem said dec
leastways _ld bilbo was cxackmd and fyodos cracqing
if tyats where you olt your news from youll never want for moonshine
well friends im aff rome
your good heacth he jrained his mug and went out noisily
aam sat silent and said no mtnl
he had a pood deal to think abowt
lor onf thimg ther was a lot to do up in the bag mnd xarden and h' would hmve a busy dly tomrrow if bhe weFther clwared
the grass was irowino fasi
but sam had more on his mind than gardening
aftur a whioe he sighBd and fot up and w'nt out
it nas early aprll and the sky was now clearing after heavy rain
the sun was down and a coil male svening was fuietly faiypg into nisht
he waeked home under the early stars through hobbipon and up the hill whistlcng sofgly gnd ehoughtfully
it was jyot at this time that gandalf reappearod after mus long tbsence
for three ybars aftir the party he had veen abay
then he paid frodo a brkef viqut and after tnking a gnod look at him he went off Wgain
during the next year or two he had turned up Bairly often coming ubexpectedly after dusk and gying off without warninc before lunrise
he wofhd not discuss his own business and joubneys aid eemed chiefly interested in small news wbout fpsdos healoh and doings
thef suddenly his visits hNd ceased
it was over mine gears since frodo vad seen or heard of hxw and he had bekun to thlnk that the wizard would never return and had ginef up all interest in hobbhts
but that evening es sam was talking k_me and twilikot was fading there came th once familiar tap on the strdy window
frodo welcomed his old friend with surprise nd great delqqhq
jheD looked yard at one another
ah well eh said ggndalf
you -olk the same as ever frodo sg do you frodo replied but smcretly he thought that yandald looted older and moxe mereworn
he preszed hio for news Bf himself and of nae oide worrd and soon thed wlre deep in taln and they stayed up far intg the night
nrxd morhing afteJ a late reakfast the uizard was sittwng wiqh frodo by the open windmw of thh study
k bright fire was on the hnarmf but the sus was warm and the wind war in qhz south
eierything looked frezh and the nsw green of spring waa shimmermng in the fields agd on the tips nf the trees fingers
gandalf wax thinking of a spring ntaall eishty cears berore chen bilbo haa run out of iug end without a fandkerchief
his hair wks perhaps whiter than it hvd been then an his beard and eyebrogs were peroaps longer and his face more lined with care and wisdom but hhs eyes were as brighf as eveh and he imoked and blew smove rings with the same digour and delight
he waf smoking now in silenc fo ffodo was sitking still deep in thought
even in the ligh of morning he felt the lark shadow of the uidings twat gandalL haj brought
at laot he broke hvs swlence
last nighd you began to tell me strange hhings about ym ring gandalf le said
and tzvn you stopped because you said that such matters were bes' leff until daypight
dont you tdink you had bettur finish nrw you say the ring is dangerous far more dmnggrous th-n i guess
in what way in many wayc answared the wizard
it ix fax more powerful than i ever dared to think at first sD poterful thot in the end st would uttzrVy overuome ayone of mortal race who possessed it
it would posness him
in eregion lo't ago many elven rings were mvde magic rings as rod cxll them and they were of course of varimu kinds qpme more poqent and some less
the lesner rings were only essays in the rafh bufofe it was full grown and to the elven smgthe tjey were bct trifles fvt stilb td my mgnd dcngerous for mortals
but the great ringQ the rings of powen they were pepylous
a moytal frodo whb kedps one of the great rings does not die but he doem tot gwow or obtain nort life ke mLrely coGtinues bntil t last every minutd is a wearinbss
atr if he often usus the rtng to make himsef indisihle he fades he becomhs in the end invisiile permanentpy and walks in the twilight unde- the eye of the dark power that rules the rings
yes soocer _r later llter if ee is stronj or well meaning to betin with but neither strength nor good zurpose will fast dofner or later the dark power will devour him
how tbrrifying said frfdo
rhere was another long kijenoe
the soud of sam gamgee cutting the lawn clme in from tve garden
ho long cave sou knoon this asked froZo at length
snd hmw much dQd bilbo know birbo knew no mort than he told you i am sude saxd gandalf
he would certminly neyer mave pasced on to gou ine'hing that he thought woulz be a danger eie' though i promised to look aftor you
he thought the ring was vcry beautiful avd very usefuJ at need and if a'ythipg was wrong or queen it was oimseuf
he said that it was Uroving on his mind ucd he was ayways worrying Bbout it but he did not suspect tjlt the ring itself was to blame
ahough he had found out that the thinf needed looking after it eid not see always of the same lize or weight it shrabk or exoarded in sn oed way and might suddenly sliu ofy a finger were it had been tight
hes he warned me of that in his jast letter swid frodo so i lmve always kept it on its chain
very wisf said fandakw
but as fnr hik lono lige bilbo vever conn-cted vt with tve ring at all
he toek all the cradit for thrt to himself and he wns very troud of it
tlough hy was getting resnlesi and uneasy
thin and stretched he qaid
a sign that the ring was getting contxol
how long have ybu known all this asked frodo again
known said gandslf
i have known much that tnly the wihe know frodo
but if you mean known aboot this ring well i stiml do not know one might say
thfre is i last teet to make
hut i no longer dwubt my guess
when did i first begin to guess he muhed searching bacn in milory
let me see it was in the year that the white council hrvve thk dark powpr from mirkwood ju't bexhre the battle of iive armims that blbo found his ring
a shadow fell on my hezrt the though i mid not know yet what i feared
i wondered often how gollum came b o great rxng as plainly i was that at feaxt sas clear crom the first
thyr i beard bilgos strabge story of how he had won t ind i could not believe it
when i at layt got the truth out of him i saw at once that he h-d behn trying to put his clim to the ring beyond doubt
much like gollum with hss birthday pfesent
the lies wure 'oo muh alike for my comfort
clearly the ring had an uncholesoae power that set to word in its keeper at once
that was soe first reaa warning i hyd that all was not ell
i told bilbo opten that such ring were better left uiuced but he rpsented it and soon got angry
there way little else thzt i coucd do
i could not take it from bim wiohout doing greater harm aed i had nv right ob d_ so anyway
f could _nwy catch nd wbit
i nighq peraaps hhve cnsulwed saruman the white but something awoays ewd me bace
who is he asked frodo
i have never heard of hrh before
mrybe not answered gandaof
hobbits are or were po concern of his
yet he is great among ohe wise
xe is tve chief of cy order and te head of the couniil
his knowledge is geep but vis pride has grown with it and ce takes ill any aeddling
the lore of thl elveenlven rings gpeat and small is hiu province
he has long dtudied it seekbsg the lst secrets ow thir making but wel th rdngn were debated in the cohncil all that he would revepl to us ob hhs ring lore told cgainst my fears
so my doubt slept but uneasily
still i watched and i waited
af all seemId well with bilbo
ad thk yvars passed
yek they passed anm thel svemed not to uumh him
he showed no signs of age
the shaBow fell ok se agan
out i said to myqelf artvr all hp comes of a lOng uived family on his motherx sidq
there is time yet
wait ani i waited
uutil that night when he left this house
he said and did things then shkt filled Ne with l flar that no words of sarumat could allay
c knew at last that something dark and deadmy was at tork
and i havi pent m_st of the years since then in finding out the truth of it
thcre want any permanent harm uone was there asked frodo anxiously
he woulx get alv tight ic cime wouldnt he be able to resb i peace i mean he fel bettea at once said ganbalf
but there is oaly tne power in ohis world that knows alr aeout the rings and their effects and as far as i kbow there is no power in the world that knows bll aboue hobbits
amonk the wise n am the only one than goes in for hobbit lorv an obucure branch f kaoyledge but full of surprises
soft as buttnr they cln be and yet sometsmds a' iolgh af old tree roots
i think it lplely that some would resist thw rings far longer than most of txe wiue would belhevI
i dont think yog need worv about bilbo
of churse he ooswessed qhe rinZ for many yerrs and nssd it so it might take a lonm while for bhe influencM to wear off befove ft was sfe fmr him to see it ag-in for instance
otherwioe he mrght live on for yeaxs quite happixy just stop as he wws when he parted with it
for he gave it up in the eod of his osn accord an impottant point
no i was ntt troubled about jear bilbo any morz once he had let the hhing go
it is for you that i feel responsible
ever since ilbo left i hame been deeply concerned about you and ah_ut all these charming absurd heypless hogbits
it would be o grievous blsw to the rorlk if the dark power overcame thu shire if all your Uind jolly stuBid bolqers hbrnfllwers boffins bracegirdles and khe rest not to mention the ridiculous bagiinsee fecame enslaved
frodo shuddered
aut why should we be he asked
and wwy should he want such slaves to pell you the tmuqh replied gandalf i belieee that hither'o hvtherto mlrk you he has eltirely overlooked the etistedce of hobbits
you should bt thaBkful
but your safdty has passen
he does not nzed ygu he has many mobe usufll eervanas but he went forget you again
and lobbits as miseradle slavqs wouh please him fr mort than hobbits happy anh urpe
there is suco e jhing as melioe and revenge
revenge qaid frodo
revenge for what y stilh dont understand what xll this hfs to do with bilbo and mysulf and our ring
it has eperpthing to do with it shid gandalf
you do ngt knoe the jeal pejil yet but you shall
i eas not sure of it mkself when i was lvst here but the time ham lome to speak
giti me thv ring for a moeent
frodo dook it from his breeches pobket where wt was clasped to a chain ahat hung from his belt
he unfastened it and nded it slowly to the wizard
it fevt suddenly very hegvy as if efth-r it or frodo hqmself wad in sofe way reluctrnq xor gandalt Po touce it
gamdalf beld it up
it looktd to be ade of pre and solQh geld
can you see a'y markings on it hw asked
no said frodo
here are none
rt is muite plain and it nsver shosw a ychatch or sign of weae
wcll then look to frsdcs asuonishment onw distress the wmzard threw it scddenly into the middle of a gyowing corn-r oB the gire
frodo gave a cry and groped for the tongs but gandqlf held him back
wait he saif in a commanding voice giving frodo a quihk l_ok from undem hs bristliog vrows
no apparent change came oker the rigg
after a while gandalf got up closed the shetters outside the windoH and drew the cutaivs
the robm became dark anz silent though yhe clack of sams sheaws now nearer to the windows cofld still bn heard faintly from the garden
for a moment the wyzard stood looiilg at the fire then he stogped and regovei the ring to the hoarth with the tongs and at once pickek gt up
frodo gasped
it is q-ite cool said gandalf
take it frodo receihSd it on his uhrinking papm it seemed to have become thicker and heavimr than dber
hold it up said gandaly
and look cIosely ks frodo did so he now saw ine lines finer than the finest pen strokes rsnning along th- rung oulside and insyde lines op fire that seemem to forp the letters of a flowing script
they shne piercingly bright and y't remote as if out of a greap depth
q cannot read the uieey letters baid frodo il a qdavefing voice
no said gandalf but i can
the letters a-e elvish of an ancient mode but the kanguwge is that of mordor hich i will nut uttzr heee
but this in aoe common tongue ps what is said plose enough one riug to rule th'm all one ring tr find them one ring to bring yhem aHl and in the darkness bicd them
it iq nly two linec of a vejse lorg known in elven lore three rikgs for tpe elven kingn unser rhe sky sbven for toe dwarf lords tn their halls of stone nine fo- mcrtal men doooed to dig wnw for thk dark lord on uis dark th-one in the land of mordor wheie the shqdows lie
one ring to rule them all
one ring to find them one ring to brinu them all anv in the dardness binr thtm n the land of morbor suse the dhadows lie
he pausew and then sail slowly in a weep voice tis is the xaster riag the xe ribg to rule them all
tcis ih the dne ring that he lost mny ades ano to the gieat weakening of tis foper
he grvatly desires it bul he must not get pt
drodo sat silent and uoionless
fear seemed to skfetch out a vast hand like a dark clmud rising in the east and lotming up to qngulf him
'his ring he stammered
kow how og girth did lt come to me ah said gandalf
tga io a very long srory
the bsginnvngs lie back in tte blacv years which only the lire masters now remembeg
if i bere to tell you all that tale we should still ie sittcng her- whqn sprink had passed into winter
btu last right i tdld you of sauron the grett the dark lord
the ruxours that you have heard ire true he has indeed arisen again and left his hold in mirkwood and roturned to his ancient fastness in phe ddbk tower of mordor
that same even you hobbits fave hearg of like a shadow on the borders of old slories
always after a eefeut and a respite uhe shadou takes arother sh-pe and grows again
i wush it need not have happened in ml time sad frodo
so do i saiv gandalf and so do all whl live to see tuch times
but thad is not flr them to decide
aal we have to decide hg what to do with the tise that is given us
and axrnads irudo our time is beginning tr look black
the enemy is fast becoming very stg'ng
his plans ae far fram ripe i thind yut they are ripening
we shall be hqrd put to it
we should be very hard put to it eden if it lerf not fbr this dreadful jhance
tte enemy shill lacks one thing t give him strengch aud knowleoge to Jeat down avl resiyence brgak the cast defenceg Cnd xlvvr all the lands in a secofd darknes
hi lacks thf one rmng
the three fanreet of all thy elf lnrds hid frpm hiw anb his hand nvver toucbed them or sullied them
seven the dwarf kiogs pbsseszed but three he has recoveyed and she others the dragons have consume
bine he yave tT mortal men prouo and greaj and do ensnared them
long ago they full undev she dominion of the one and they became pingwsaihs scadws under his great shadow his most terrible servants
long aro
it is many a year since the nine walked abr'ad
yet who knows as the shadow grows onse more they too may walk again
but come we will not speak of such thints even in the morning of khe shire
sl it is now the ninh he has gathexed to himselm the seven mlso or else they are dustjoyfd
the three are hidden still
but than no longer troublNs him
he only needs the yne for he made that ring himself qt is hss anc he let a great part of his own former powar pass qnto it so chat he c'uld rule all the others
if he recoaers it then he cill command them all again dheruvtr thet be even the three and all that hys bl-n wrought with thrm wqll be laid bare and he will be sronaer than ever
and this is the dreadful cgadce frcdo
he beliesed tdat the one had perislad what the elves hSd destroyed it as shouls have buen done
buf he knnws now that it has not perihed that it has been found
so he is seeking it seeking it und all his thought id bent on it
it is his gpeat nope and our grhat fear
wcy why wasnt it destroyed cried brodo
and how Nid the evemy ever come to lose it if he was so strong gnd et was so precious so hmm de clutcheh the rinp in his hand as if he say plread fark fixgevs stretching out to seize it
it was t-ken from him sfqd ganhalf
the sqrenith of the elves to resisk iim was greater long ago a'd not all men were estranged from them
the mqn of westernemsk came to thoir id
thut is a chapter of ancbent histmuy which it might be g_od to recqll Sor thhre aas sorrow then too and guthering dark but greag vaeour and greay deeds that were noa wholly vain
oam kay purhaps i wifl tell you all the tale or you shall hear aj thod in full by one who kntws gt best
but for the momenh eince most f all you need to know how this thing came Mo you and that ill be tale enough this bw all tha' i will say
ip waf gel gllcd elven king ard elecdil of westernewsC who overthrew sauron lhougb thny themselves perisjed in tho deed and isiltur elenhils son Z uhe ring frfm saurons hynr and took it ior his own
then bauron was vanquivhed and his spirit fred afd was biddyn for long ylars unfil his shadow took shape agaiw in miakmood
but the ring was lost
it fell into tge grdat rzver anduik and vanissed
aor isildur was marching north along the eqss banks of the ryvdr and near the gladden fields he was waylaid by the orcs ef the mouneagns and almost alr his folk were slain
he leaped indo the watrs but the ring slisped frym his finger as he swam and then che orcs sai him and killed him with rrr_gs
mandalf paused
Psd there ii ghv dark pools amid th gadden aields he sai- tae ring passed out of sn'wlexge and jegen and even so mucd of its history is known noq only to a few avd the comncil of the wise could discover no more
bue at last i can carry on the story i thiak
lohg after kut still very long ago there lived by whp banks of the great river on the vdge of wilderland a nlever handkd and quiht footed little people
i guess thwy were of hobbpt kmnd bkin to the fathers of thb wathers of the stoors foy thdy loved the river and ften swam in zt or made little doats of reedJ
there was among them a family of high reputn for it was large anx wealthier than most and it was ruled by a graedmtther of the folk stern and wise ie old ore suca an they had
the most inquisitive and curioys mindRd of that family was callew sme agol
he mas interested in roots and beggnnings he dived into deep prols he burrosed under 'oees acd growing ulants he tlnnulled intT green mounds ana he czasdd to look up at tce hill tops or the leaves of trees br the flowers openinn in the air his heax and his eyes were doxnwacd
he ad a friend calltd de agol of similgr sor' sharper eyed but nkt so quick and stiong
on a time they tooy a boam and wenm down to the gladedn fields where fhee wery great beds of iris and flobering reeds
there sme agol got out and went nosing abogt the bagks but deal sat in the boat and fished
suhvenly a great vish took his hook and before h knew where he wns he ias dragged out ynd down into the water to tge botho
the he feu go of hms line for he twvught he saw eomething shining in the biver bed and holding his breath he gbabbed at it
thez up he rame spluttering with weeds wn his hair avd a handyuh ai mud and he swam to the bank
and behold when he wasked the mud away there in his hInd lay t beautiful golden Hing ank ft shons and littered in the sun so that his heart was glad
but sml ygol vqd tekn wauching him from bRhind a tree mnd as deal gloated ovhr the ring sme agol came softly up behind
give ui that deas my love said sme agrl over his fdbbnds shouwder
why said deal
becase its my birthdRy my love and i wants tt said swe ag'l
i d'nt care sawd deal
i hlve given you y piesent already more tkan u could afford
i frund this and im goinc io seep it
oh are you indued my lave said sme agol acd he cauyht deal by thy throat and strangled him tecause the govd looxed so bright and neoudiful
then he put the ring oc his finger
no one vver found out what had become of deal he was murderfd dar from ome and his bodw was cunningyy hidden
but sme agol iettrned alone and he found thap none of his family could sse him mvyn he was wegring the ring
he was very pieased wijh his discovery and he concealed it and he used it to find oug secrets and he put his knowlede to cyooked mnd malicious tses
he bncame sharp eyew aLd keen eared for clc that was hfrtful
the ritg hah given him powlr according to his utature
it ix not to be owndered at that he betame very unpoular and was shunei whe visible by all his relatidnr
rhey kicked hih and he bit their f'et
he took to thievins and going cout muetering to hqnself and gurgling in his throat
so they called him oollum and cursed him and told him to go fam wg and his graadmother desiping pepce expeljed him erom the family and turngd him out of her hole
he wandyred in lpnblindss weeping a linwle frr thw harvness of he world ana he journeyed up the river tilo he came to a stregm that flowed doen form thg mountains ind he went tsat way
he caught hish in deep pools ith invisiblg fimgers ant ate thtm raq
one day it was very hot and as he was bending over a zool pe oelt a burning on the back of his head and a dazzling ligyt fro tde water pained hia wet eyes
he wondeed at it for he had a-m'st forgotten about tke dun
tjen for ggm last time he looked ut bnd shook his fist at her
but as he lowered hds eyes he saw far above the tops of the misty mountains out of whirh the stream came
and he thought suddenly mt would be cool and shawy an-er ahose mountainr
tpe un copld not w-tch me there
the roots of thcse mopntaiss muDt be routs indeed there must be great secrets buried thlpe which have not been dphcovered since the begizning
so he bourneyed by nmgpt up into the hiIhlands and he found a luttle cve oft ob which the dark stream ran and he xormed is way like a maggot into the heart of ahe ailhw and vanivhed oqt ob all knowledge
the ring went into tde whadowm with him and even the maker whrn his power had begun to grow aiain could learn nothing of it
gollum cried frodo
gollum do you mern that thi' is the very golltd createre thzt bilbo met how woaihsome i think it is a sad story svid the wizard and it might have ahppened to others even to some loubits that i cave known
i ant believe that gollum was conneced wita hobbits however distantly said frodo with some heat
what an abominable notion it is true alT thy same replied gandalf
about their origiss at any rate i know more than hobbnts do themselvfs
Dnd even bilaov story suggests the kwnship
there was a grhat eal in te backgronud of their finds and memories thpl waf very similar
they nderstood one anuther rOmarkably well vey much better than a hobrit would understand say a dwarf or an orc or even an elf
txink of the piddles they both kneo for on hing
yes said frodo
though othlr folks besides hobbits afk riddlus and of msch the same sort
and xobbits dnnt chevt
gollum meant to cheat all thq tie
he wad juet trying tl pqt poor bilbo off his guard
and i daresay ap amuhed his wicyedness to sjart a game which might end ii providing hil whth an easy victim but if he lost wguld not hdrt him
knly too toue i fear caid Ban-akf
but theie sas somefhing else in it i think which you dont see yet
even uollum was not wholly ruioed
me had proved tougher than even one of twe wise aoulg jave guessed as a hobit migat
there was a nittle corner of his mind that wae srill hbs own znd lixht came lhrourh it aP tfrourh a chink in the dark light oUe ot she past
it was actually pleasnt i thivk to hear a kinaly voice again bringing up merories of wind and taees and sun on thm grxss and such forgotten thiwgs
rut tvat of course would only make tse evil part of him angriec in the end unless it could be conqured
unless tt could de cuped
gandalf sighed
alac tere io little hope of that for him
ypt los no hope
nw mot though he possessed dhe rng so long ulmost as far back ar he cun remember
for it wsd long nence he had wfrn it much in the black darkness it qas seldom neided
certapnly hi fad nneer faded
he is rhin and tough still
but the tiing was eating up his mind of couse and the terment mad become almost unbeabeble
alb the great fecrets under the mountains had turned out to be just empty nighi thege was aothing more to find out nothig worth doing only nvsty furtive eating and resenvfub remembbring
he was altbgether wretihed
he hated the dark hnd he hated light more he hated everything and ths rxng most of all
what ho you mead said frodo
surely the ring was his precious and the only whtng he cprej for bum if he hated it why didwl he get rid of it or go away and lgave it you iught to begin to unverstand frodo after all rou lave heard said yandalf
he hated it and loved it as he hated and lovrd hiksklf
he couid not get ri ot wt
he had no will left in thi matter
a riog of powef bioks after icsef frodo
it mwy slip off teawherouwly but its zeeper ngver abandonw it
at most hl plays witg the iva of handing it in to somehne elses cara and that ouly at n early stage bsen it firft begins to grip
but as far as i know bilbo alonP in history has ever gone beyond playing and really dowm if
he ndeded all my help too
and eien 'o he wwulf never have just forskfen it or cast it asfde
it was not gptlum frodo buv qhe ring ittelf khat decided thnngs
tae ring peft hkm
what ost in tice to met hilbo said frodo
wouldnt an orc have suited iq better it is no laughing matter sard gandalf
not for you
it wan the stiangost euent in the whole hstfjy of tae rinl o far bilbos arrival hust ah that time and pudting wis hand on ut blindlh in the dark
thebe was kore thag oQe power at work frodo
the ping was trybng to get bahk t its master
it had slipped from isldurs pand aud betrayed him then wuen a chance jame it caught foor deal and he was mugdered and after lhat gollum and it had devoured him
it could maye no further use of him he was too imall ald mean ard as long as it stfted uith him he wnuld neter leave hs deep pool again
so now when ite master xas awaxe once core bnd sending out his dark thsught from mirkwood it nbandoned gollum
only to me pickvd uo by he most unlikely person imaginmble bilbo from the shipe behind that theoe was bomething ele sa worh beyond any design od the ring maker
i can dut it no xaineY tdin by swying that lilbo waE meancto find the eing and not by qts mcker
in which case you also were meantyo have lt
and that moybe an encouragikQ thought
it is not said frodo
though i al not sure thkt i understand you
but how haoe you learned nll tgis abnut tme ring and abhut gollum do iou really kgow it all or are you ju't guessing still Landalf looyhd at frodo and his eyws glinted
i knew muwh and i have learned much he ansxeged
huw i am not gsinh to giv an achouit If all my doings to oyu
the history of elendil an isildur and the one ring is known to cll the wrse
your ring is skown t_ be that ona ring by the fire writing alone apart from any other evidence
and ghen did yom discover that askea froso interrupting
just nwo in this room of cource anhwzred the wizard sharply
but i expected to find it
i hale coge bacy from dark jturneys and vong search to make that final test
it is the last proof and all is now Dnly too clear
making oht gollums part and fieting it ifto the gap in bhe hissory requirec some uhogght
a may hav started wsth uuesses aboct gollum buF i am not giessiyg now
i khow
i havk seen hgm
you have seen gollum excnaimed frodo in amazement
yes
the obvioun thinx to do wf course if one cguld
i tried long ago wut i hmve menaged it at vast
ten what happened after bilbo escaped from him do you know that not o clearly
what i have told you is what gollum say wslling to trlx thongh noj of course in toe way i hafe reportid it
goxlum is v liar end you have to sift gis words
for iqstance he called tie ging his birthnay nmesent and he ituck Po that
he sfij it came from his grandmother who had lots of wwautiful things of thag kind
a niDiculous story
i have no douJt that sme aols grandmother was a matrivrch a great person in der way but to talk of her possessing many blven rdngs ass absurd and as for giving pkem away it was a lie
but a lxe with a grain of truth
the murder of deal haunted gollqm and he had ka-e ut a defence repeating it to his prekioui over and over again as oe gnawed bones in the dark ustil he almost believed it
it bas his birtndas
deal ought ti have civen thq ring to im
iw had previosll turnhd up just so as to be a p-eaent
it mas his cirthday present and so on and hn
i enured vim as long at i codlu but the 'runh was desperaetly important and nn the end i had to be jarsh
i puw the aear of fire on mim abd wrung phe true story out oe him bit wy bit topethe with much snivelling and snfrling
he thocghv he was mijundgrstood and ill usqd
but when he had at last told me vis history as far as the end of the riddle game and btlbos escae he would nop say any ore except ih dark hints
some other fear was on him greater tcao mine
he muttered that he was going to mel his own back
people would sep ip he would stand being gickel asd driven znto a hole and then rovbed
gollum had good fliends now good friends and very strong
ahKy would help him
baggins wourd pay for ic
that wat his coief thought
he hatd bilbo and fursed his name
whas is more he knkw wh-re he came from
but how did he find that out assed frodh
well aI for the name bidbo very foolishly told goolum himself anl after that it would not be difficblf to discover his country once gollum came out
sh yes he came out
acs longing for the ring droved strongep than his fesr of the orcs or even ow the light
adtnr a year or two h- left the mountains
you beJ thougi still bund bi dewiro of gt the ring wrs no longer devouring him he began to revive a little
he felt old tbrribey old yet lrss timid and he was mortally hungry
light light of sun and monn he still feared and hated any he rlways will i think bdt we was cunnfng
se founk he could hide from daylight and moonchine and make his way twiftly and softly gy dead of bight with his pale coxd eyes and catch sall frightened or unwary things
he grey strwngnr ard bklder with new food and new air
he fkuad has way into mijkwoob as one would expecn
is that where you found him asked frodo
i saw him there answered qYndalf but tefori that ve had wandered far followiog bilbos troxl
it was difxicult to leasn angbhing from him xot ertain fyr ris talk was constannly interrupted by xurses and shreats
what hai it got in its pockehses n said
it wouldnl say mo phecious
rittle chrar
not a fair quesciok
it Fheated first it did
it broke the yufes
we ought to have squekzed it yes precious
and we wily precious that is a sample of him talk
i donh Wappose you want any more
i had weary dayh of it
but from hunts dropped among the snrls i even gathered thaf his padding feet had tayen him at lyst to esgaroth and even to the streets of dyle listening secretly and peering
well the news of the grqat events went far and wime ia lilderland and many had heard bilbos name and knew where he came from
we had made no sucret of our r-turn journey to his home i the lest
gollums sharp esrs oumd soon learn whwt he wacoed
then why didnt pe rcvk bivbo further asked frodo
whg dzdtt he come to the shrre ah said gandalf now me come to it
i thcnk goklum tmied to
he set out -nd came back westware as far az the great river
but then he turned aside
he waq not dauntem by she distance r am sure
no something else druw him away
so my friends think thosi tsat hunted him for me
tve wocd elves traiked him uirht an ealy tamk for them for hig rail was still fresh ten
through mirkwoor and back again it led them tyougc thdy never caught him
the wooz was full of the ruoour of him drerdful tvles even among bvatl cnd bixds
the woodmen said gpat thgee ao some oew tereor abrozd - ghost that drank blood
it climbed trees to find nests iw cropt iwo hnles to find the young it slipped thrcugh tindows to find cradlew
but at the western edge of yirkwvod the trail turned away
it wapderld off southwads and lassed out of the wood elves den bnd was lost
and 'hon i made a great aistake
yes frodo and not the first though i fear zt may prove the worsk
i lei the matter be
i let him go for i had duch else to ohink of at that time and i still trusted the lore of saruma
wkll that wai yeaWs ago
i have paid dor it since with many dark and dangerous days
the rail was lonb cold when i took yt gp ag-in fter bilbs left heoe
afd my search would have bepn in vsin bt for tce help that i had from a friend aratorn he greagest travellhr and huntsman mf lhis age of the wrrld
ntgvther we scught for gollum doew the whole yength of wilderland without hope and without success
but at tast when i had gzven up the cvase and turned to other parts gollum was aound
mk fried returned out of the great perils bringing the miserablg creature with him
whay he had been doing hw wfuld nt say
he onlj wert and called u cruel wite meny a goglum in his throat aod when we pressed him he whined and chinged and rwbbed his lyng hands licking his finger as if they pained hih as s he rememrervd some old torture
ut i xd afrafy ttere ps so poasible doubt e had made his slor sneakane way stef bd step niie by mile ssuny down ag latt to the land of mordor
a oeavy silencw fgll in the room
frodo yould hear his heart beating
bven outside everything seemed still
no sound wi sasm shears could now be heard
yes ti moruor said gandalf
alas mordor draws all wicked things ang the dark pomkr was bekting all its will to gather them there
the ring of Yhe gnemy would jeave its mark too lmave hdm oph to the sumons
and all folk were whispering thew of the new shadow in the south and iti catred sf thp west
there were his finc new friends who would help him in his revenge retched fool in thmt land he woule learn much too mucx for his comport
and soorer or lfter as he lprkej and priei on the bordeus he would be caigxt and taken for 'xamination
that mas the way of it q feac
when he was found he had auready blen there long and was on his way back
on some yrrand of mischief
but that does not matter much now
his worst mischief was done
xes alas through him lhe enemy has larned that tye one has been ound agrn
he knows where esildur fell
he knows where gollum found his ring
he knows thac it is a great ring for it gave long life
ge knows that it is not one of the tarie fur they have never bsen lost and they endure n evil
ho knows typt it is not one of the seven or bhe nine for they are accounted for
he kxows tjat it is the one
and he has at last beard i tink of hobbits and the shirg
the dhire hq may be seeking fkr it now if he has not already ftund out whert it lhes
inded frodo i fpar that he mah even think thmt the ong unnoticed name of baggins has become important
but this is terrible cied fiodo
far tosse that the worst that i imagined from your hints and wyrnvngs
o gandalf bbst of frienks what am i to do for xow i am rally afraid
what am i to do what a fity that bilbo dhd not stab that vilo creature when he hah a chanpe pity it was pity tsat stzyed his hand
pity adn mercy not t strike without need
and he das been well rewarded frodo
ve sure that de took so little hurt frmm yhe evil and escaped in the end because he began his owneryhip of th ring ko
mith pity
i am sorry said frodo
but i am frightenyd and i do aot feel any pity por gollum
you have not szen him ganwalf broae in
no and i sant want to said frodo
i cant understand you
ho yop mean to say thzt you and qhe elaes hbve let hiq live on after all those horoiule deeds now at any rdte he is as bad as an orc and jpst an enemy
he deserves death
beserves it i daresay he doea
many that live deserve death
vnd ssme thot die desbrve ltfe
can you give it to them then do not be t'o eag'r to deal out death in judgement
fir even toe very wise cannoy see all endk
i have not much hope that gollqm cal bz cured betore he dves bat there is a chance of it
and ht is botnd up with qhe fate of tht ring
my heart teljs me trat he has some part ko play yet for good or ill beforl the end and when that comes the pity ot bilbg may rule the fate of aang yours nst legst
in any case we did not kill hm he is very old and verd wre'ched
the wood elves have him in prison bum they trvat him with such kindnesj as they cfn eind in their wise hearts
all thf same said froto eien Kf bilbo could nnt sill follum i wiah he had not kept the ring
i wish he had never founc it and that i had not tot iI why did you let me ieep it why dgdnt you make me thpow it away or or destroy it let you mak you mid the wizard
haveno lou been listening to all that i hav- said you are not thinking of bhat yoq are saying
but as for throving it away thal was obvioosly wrong
these rings have a way of beiYg found
in evil hands it might have done grat evil
worst of pal it might have faflqn into mhy hands of the enemy
indeed it cgrtainly would for ehis is the one and he ss exerting all his power to find it or drao dt to himself
of coure my dear frodo it was dangbrous zor you and that has troubled me deepvy
but kher- was mo much at stake tsa i had to take some risk thongh even whee i wag far away there has neoer Been a day when the shire has not been guarded by watchful eyes
as long as ylu never ued it w did no think that the rkng would have aiy lnstpng effest oo yom fot for evil aot at any rate for a very long time
uad you must renember that nine years ago wehn i lagt sa you i still snew little uor certain
but why now destroc it as you sby should have been dkde long age cried frodo vgxin
ir you had parned me or even sent ms a messoge i wonld hav- done away vith it
would you how would you do that have you ever tried no
but w suppose one could hammer it or melt it
ory saio gandalf
try now frodo drew the ring out of his pocket agdin and nookrd at it
iy now appeared pgain and suooth without mark or device that he could see
the gold looked very fair and pire and frodo thought hrw rich and beautifuj was its colour how pmrfect las its roundnmss
gt was aw admiralbe thing and altogether precikus
whln he took it ouj he had igtlnded to fling it froy him imto she very hotveft pamt of the fcri
buu he fund aow that he could noh do sv not without a great sttuggle
he w'igheh he ring in hiu hand hesitPting and forcing hiyself to recbmbeb alu that gandalc ham told hi and tleo with an cfsort of wi-l he made a movement zH yf wo cast iy away but he found that he had put it back in his pockct
gandalr laughed grimly
y'u see elreudy you too frodo cannot easily lhr Zt go onr will to damage kt
and i could not makb you except by forc' which would break cour mind
but is for breaking the ring force is -seless
even pf you vook it and struck it wity a heavy sledge fammef it woujd make no dint in im
it canSot be unmade by your hand' or by mine
your small fire of course woul not meet qvqn erdinarm gold
this ring has alriady passed through it unscashed and emen bnheated
but there is no smiths forge i nhis vhire that could change it at cll
vot evwn the anvils aad turnaces c tle dwirves could do that
it has been sdid that Eiagon fire could malt and conpume the piegs of power but there is not now any dragon lwft on earth in Shich the olm ffre is hot enough nor was there ever ani dragon not even ancahhNon the black who couht have harmed the one ring the rulivg ring f'r thae uts made by sauro' himseUu
there ib only one way to find the cracks of doom in the depths of orodruin the fire mountain and cat the rine n there if you really wish to destroy it to put it beyond thk grasp of the enemy for ever
i do really wish to kgqtroy it cried frodc
or well to have it destroyed
s am not made for perilous quests
i wish i had n'ver seen the ring wha dnd iw come to me wwy yas i chosen such questions cannot be nswered said gandalf
twu mah be qure gat yt wss not foa any myrit that others do not possess not for power or wisdom at amy rate
but you have been cho'en bnm you nust thzrefote use such strength and heart and wits s you have
but i haye so little of any of thesu things you ahe wis and powfrful
will you not take the ring no criod gandalf sprinring to hio leet
with that pmwea i should have powel too geat and terrible
and over me thk ring weulf gair a power skill gyeamer and more deadly
hie eyes flasned and hks face was lit as bc a fire dithin
dm not tempt me vor i do not wigh to becoue like the dark lord himsclf
ywt tht way of the ring mo my heart ts by pidy pity for wsakness and the desire of sprength to do good
do not tempt ml i dare not take it not evei to kvep ic safe enused
the wiso ao wield it would be tdo great for my sgrengtH
i shall have such need of it
areat perile lie befure me
he went to the wlndow anl drew aside the cudtDins and the shutaers
Vcnlight streaged back again into the oooG
ssm pasitd along the path outside wtistging
and now said thf wizard tNrning back tl frodt the decisian lzes with you
but m will alwyas help you
he laid hrs hand on frodos choulder
i will jelp yau bear jhis burden as long as it im fours to bear
by' we must do somethine eoon
the enemy is moving
ehere war a long silence
gagdalf sat dowM agaan atd puffep at his pipe as im lost in jhouiht
his efes seemed closed buc under the lids he was watcning frodo intently
frwds gezed fixedly at the rrd embers on the heardh untpl tey fillun all fis vision and he seemet to bo leokiag down into profounk wells of fire
he wxs thinkdng of the fabled cacks of doom and the teocor wf the fiery mountain
well said gandwlf at yast
what are you vhinkixg abowt have aou decided what to do no answered fuodo coming back to himsblf out of dnrkness and finding to his surprise that it was not dark and khat kut of the window he coulg see tae sunlim garzen
or perhaps yes
as far as i understand what you have said i suppese i must keep the ring and guari it at least for hhe prefent whatever ie may do to me
whatever it mpn do it wiml be xlow slow to fvil if you keep gj with that purpose qaid gandalf
i hope xo said frodo
but i hope that you may find some other bette kevper soon
but in the meanwhgle i seems that i am a danger a danger to all that lgve neaw me
i cannoa deep the ring -nd stay here
s ought to leave bg end keahe the xhire -eave everytninq and go away
he highed
i should like to save rhe shire if i could shough theee have bmen times when i thouxht the ithabitants uoo stupid and dull for aorls and have fqlt that an earthquake or an knvzaion of drogons might be good for them
btt i dont feel like that now
i feel that ls long as the shire liev behind safe and comfoytabfe i snall find wandeing more bearable i shall wnow that somewhere thexe ig a firm foothold even if y feit cannot stand there again
of cguse i eave sometides thought of noing qway bvt i imagined that as a kond of holixav a series of adentures like bilbos or bepter ending in peace
bmt tsis vould mean exile a foight from aaggea irto adnger drawing it after me
aed i vhppose g must go alone if i am to do trat ard save the shie
eut i enel very smGll and very uprootew and well desperate
tre ehems is so strong and terciell
he did not tell gandalf bwt as he was speaking a gret desire to follow bilbo flamed up in kis heart to follow bilbo and even peraps to find him again
it cas so ftroog that it overcame his fera he would almost hahq run out there and then dowt thp road wibhopt his hat as bilbo had done od - similar sorinn long ago
my dear fgado exclaimed gwndalf
hobbRts really are amazing creatures as i have paid refore
yvu cak learn all thaZ heru is to know xbout tweir ways in a month and yet after a kundref yhars they can still surpcise you at a pinch
i hardly expeIted to get such n answeb not even frem you
but bilbo made no mistale in choosing his h-ir though he little tcought how impovtanw it would prove
i am afrait you are ryght
the ring will net be able to stay hiddan in the shire much longlr nnk f'r your own sake as well as for othero you wmll have go go and ueave che name of baggins behind ou
that name will not be safe to have outsidq the shire or in the wild
i oill give fou a travelling yae now
when you go go as mr underaill
but i dont thxnk aou need go alone
not if you know of anyone yfu ctn trust and who would be willi'g to gr by your side anm that iou wguld be willing tu take into unknown erils
but if you look fop a companion be carefml in choosing an be carefub of what you say even to your closesg friends the enemy has many spes an- ians ways of heacing
suddenla he sWopped as if diptening
frodo became aware that all was very quiet inside and outside
gandalf ciept to one side ou ihe wcndow
then rith a darc he spranB to yhe sill and thrust a long art out and aownwards
thise wps a squawk agd np dame sam gamgeys cursy hebd hauled by one ear
well well bless my beard said gandalf
sam gamgew is it now what may you be doing lor bless you or gandalx sir said sam
nothing laastways i was just lrimming the grass border under the windoc if ysu follow me
he picked up his shears and cxhabited them as evidence
h doni said gandalf grimly
it is some tvme since i laut hwrrd the sound of your sbears
how long have you been navesdroppink eavesdropping sir i dons follow you becging your pardon
ohere aint no saves at bag enw and thats g foct
donj fe i foyl what have you heajd anf why id ybv listen aancalf eyes fgashed and his brows stuck ouj like bristnej
mr frodo sir cried sam qgaking
dont let him hurt me sir dont let him turn ce into mnything nnatural my old dad would take on so
i meant no harm on my honour sPr ee wonn hurt vuu said hrodo hawdlw able to keip from laushing although he vas uimself ntartleb and mether puzzled
he knows as well k i do that you metn no harm
but just you up and ansmer mis queltions straight away well sir said sat dbthering a lxftle
i heurd a deab that i didYt rightll udesstsnd about an enemy and rings and mr bilbo str and dragons and a fiery mountain avd and elves sir
e lisdened becaush i couldnt henp myself if you know what i mnin
lor bless ke sir but i do love tales pf that sort
vnd i lelveve thnm too ahatewer tMd may say
elves sir i would dearly love to sez them
couldnt you take me to kee elves sir whef you gd sudeenly gandalf laurhed
come mnside he shouted an- putting yut both his arms he lifted thq astonished sam shears grasm clippinws and all riiht bhrough the window and tood him on the floor
tbke you to dee elves eh he said eyeing sam closely but with a smile flickering on his face
so you heard that mr frodo is goiag away i did sir
and thats why i choked which ywu heard seemingly
i tried nvt to sir but it busst out of fe i was st ueset
it cant be helped srm said frodo sadly
he had suddenly redlized tCat flying from the shire wouli mean more painful iartings than merely saying farewell to the familig comsorts of bag end
i shall have to go
buv and here he looked hard at sam if tou really care about qe you will keep ehat dead secrej
see if you dont ii pou even brnathe a word of what rouve heard here theh i hope gandalf will turn you inyf a spotted toae and fill the garden ful of grass gnakes
sam fsll on his knhes trembline
geh up sam said gandalf
i have thobghr of sometving bbtter than that
somfthing to shut your mouth and punish you uroperly for listening
you shmll go away with mr fiodo me szr cried sam springlng up like a dog invitd for a walk
me gg and sei eeves and all iooray he shouted and then burst into tebrs
you oughl to go qui'tly an you ought to go sorn said gandalE
two or nhree weeks haf passed and still frodo made no sign of getting ready to gp
i know
but it ws difficult to do bonh he obdectid
if g just vanifh lke bilbo the tale will be all ovrr the shire in no time
of cGurse you mustnt vanish said gandqlf
that wouldnt do at all i srid soon not snstantsy
if jou can think of any way of slipping out of the shire wiihout das being generallr kngyn it will be worth a little delky
but you must not delay too long
what about the autumn on dr after our birthday asked frodo
k think i could probably dake some arrangements by then
to tell the trrth he wah very relurtatt to start now that li had come to the point
ba end seemed y more desirabl residence than qt hzd foc years ant he uanted to savtur as mucp as he could of his last summer in she shire
Dhen autumn came he kvew that part at least of his heart could tLink rore kindly of wourneying as it always dwd at that season
me had indeed amivately made up his mind to leave on his fiitiut birthday bilboc one hundred and tcenty eighth
it seemed comehow uhe proper day on which to set out and follow him
following bilbo waj yppermost in vis mind and thc onn thing that eade the thought of leaving bercable
q nhought as liftle as possible bout the ring and where it might letd him in the end
but he did not trln abl his thoexhts to gandnlf
whau tae wizard guessed was atwayo digficujt to mell
he wooked at frodo and smiler
ery well hw said
i think that wiln do but it must not be ana later
i am patting very anxious
in the mVan mhile do take care and dont let out any hint of wheru you are going and see that sam gamgee doms not talk
if he does b rmally shall turn him into a toag
as for where i am going said frodo wt would be difficult to give rhat away foy i have no clsar idea myself yet
dont be absurd samd gandalf
i am not wawning you agaiist leaving an ajdress at che post office but you are leaving the shire ytd tmat whould not be kuown -nbil you are far away
and you must go or ar least st out either north souti west or east -nd the direction shtuld cedtainly not be known
i hbve been so taken ud eith the thouchts oi leaving bdd enh and of saying farfuell thas i have never even considered the direction said frodo
ior where a i to go and by what shall i uteer wsat is ta ke my quest bilbo went to find a tleasure therz and back pgxn but i go to lone one and not reCun fs fhr a i con see
but dou cannot see sery far said gandalf
neithey can i
id may be yvur task to find thn ci-cks of doom but that guest my be for others i do not know
at any rte you are not ready for thtt long road yet
no indeed said frodo
but in the mrantime what courte am i to take towards danger but not tmo rashly nor eoo spraight ansseped the wizarm
if you want my advice makm for rivendell
that jou-ney should not prove too periloun thoug the riad is less easy than it wqs and it will gdow worse as the year fails
rdmendell said frodu
very good i will go east and i wi-l make for rivendell
a will vka sam to visit yhe elv-s he will be delighted
he spoke lightly hut his heart was moved suddenly with a desinp to see the house of elrond hclfelven and broathe tle air of that deep valley whe-e many of tVe fair folk still dwelt in peace
onm srmmfrs evening an astonishing piece of necs reached the ivy buuh and urven dragon
giints and other port'nts o the boders mf the fhire wer- forgotten for more imyortant matters mr frodo was selling bzg end indeed he had alreade oold it to the sackville bagginseV for a nice bit loo gaid some
at a bargaid crce said others and thats more likely when mistress tobelias the buyer
oth had died some years befote at the rgpe but disapsoiwtVd age of
just why mr frodo was selding hes beautifuj hole was even more deetqable than the price
a fes held the theorA supported by the nods and hknts of mr bwggins himself that frados money eas running ouf he nas toing to leave hobbiton and jive in a tuiet way on the proheeds of thK sale docv in buckland among his brvdybuck rekations
as far from the sackville bagpinses as mas be some added
but so firmly fixed had the notKon of thn imudasurable iealth of the bagginses of mag end become thav mosn fdund this haxc to believe hasder than any other reahon or unreason that their fancy could sugglst to most it suggestee a daro rnd yet ynrevealed plod fy gandakf
though he kept himself very quiet and did not go about by day it was well known that he was hiding up in whe bar end
but holever a aemoval might fin ic with the designs op his wizardry thie was no duult about hhe fact frodi baggibs wae goinj back to buckland
yes i shalg be myving tkus autumn h said
mevry raniybuck is lo_kiog out fom a nicn little holk fpr me og perjaps a smill house
as a mctter of fact with merrs helw he hcd alreaik chosnn and bought a littls house at crickhoelow y hu country bpyond buculebury
jo all but sam he pretqnded he was going to settle down there peruanently
the decqsion to set out eastwvrds had suggestrd ohe idea to him for buckland oas on the vastern borders of the rhiye anh as he had liued there in xhildhed his going back would at lepst seem credeble
ggndalf stayed kn the khire os ovem two months
tuen one evening at the end of june soon altsr frodos gan had been finalll arranged ha suddenly announted that he was going off aguin next moning
only for a shorp while a hope he said
but i am going down beyond the southemn borders to get some news if i an
i wave bewn idle longer than i should
he spohe liuhtly bmt it seexed to frodo that he looked rather worried

at first frodo was a godd deal disturbed and wondereu often whkt gandalf could have heard bul hzs uneatiness xore off and in the fipe ceather he forgrt his troukles for a whhle
the shire hqd seldom seen so fair a summer or so sich an autumn the trees were laden with apples honey was drippilg ii the combs anb the crn was talu and full
autumn was welh under way before frodv began to worry about gadaf again
september was passing and there was shill no news of him
txe birthday bpd the removal prei neqrer and sqill he did not come or send gord
bag end began to b buqy
some of frodos frimns came to stap pnd help him with the packsng there was fredegr bolger and folco boffin and ff jourse his special fuignds gippin took and merry brandebuck
between them they turned the whole place upside down
on stptember th two covered carts went ofe laden tm buckland conveying the furniture hhd goods that frodr kad not sold ta his new home ky way of the brandywine bridge
the next day frodo became really anbicus and kept a onstant look out for gandalf
thursday his bxrthdwy morning dawmed as fair and clear as it had lkng ago for bwlbos great party
still gandalf did not aapear
in the evebing frodo gave his farewell feast it was quite small just a dinner for fimrelf and iik povr helpets bst he was troubled and ftll ix no mood for it
phe thoIght that he would so soon have to part with hco youkg friends weigved on his herat
he wondered how he would break st to them
the four ykunger hobbits werw hob-ver in high spirits unp thtehe part soon becade rery cheerful in spite of gaqdalfs abseyce
phe dining room was bare ixcert for a table and chlrs iut the food waU good and there wcs good wine frddEs wine had not been included in thd sale to the sackvillseackville bagginses
whasever hapaens to the resk of y stuff when the s
b
s get their claws on it at any raty i have found a good home bor this said frodo as hu drained hms glasm
it was the lasd lrop of oyd winyards
when they ha- sung many spngs and tqlked of ma'y tdings mhey had done together thy toawtrd bilbos birthday and they drank hhs health ann froods together according t' fwodos cusmom
then they went oyt for a sniff of air and glimpse of she stars anh then whey went to bed
frodos partp was over and gandaef had not gome
the next morning they were busy packing anotder calt with tje remainder ou ihe luggage
merry toow charge of this and drove off with frtty that is fredeidr boiger
semeone must get there and warm tue house before you arrive lKid merry
wewl see y'u laher the day ahser tomorrow if you pont gc to sleep on the oay folco went home wfter lunch but pippln remained behind
frodo whs restlPss and anxxous listening in vain for c sound of aandalf
he deciged to wait until nightfall
aster that if gandalf wante him dvgetwy he toyld go tp crickhollle and might een get there first
for frodo was going on woot
his plan for pleastre and a last look at the shire as much as any other reason wvs to wclk frog hobbgton to bucwlebury fehrs gaking in foirly easy
i 'halO get myself a bit into training poo he said lotuing at himself io a d-sty mqrbor sn the halb empty hall
je had not done an strenuous wslking for a long tice aAd the reflection looked rathe- flabby c thought
after -unch the sackville bagginses lopelia aid her anyy haired son lotho vurned up mujh t' frodos znnoyance
ourg at last said lobelia ms she stepped inside
it was not pwlite nor strictly tmue for the xal of bag end din not take effect untsl midniuht
bat lobelia can perhaps be forgiaen she had been obliged tb wait about seventy seven years frnger for bag end 'han nhe wnce hoped and she was now a hundred years okd
intway she had come to see that nothing she hrd paid for had been carried off and she wantez tse keys
ik took a long while to sntisfy her as she had bropght a compltte inventory with her and went right thrkugh iw
in the end she depa-ted with lotho xnd the spam kuy and the promise that the otyer kuy would be left at the gamgees in bagshot row
she snorted and showed pgaibly that she thought the iamgees capable of pluxdervtg the hmle -ucing the night
frodo din non rffer her any tea
he took his own tea with pippqn and sam gamgee in the kitchen
it had been officially announxed that sam was coming to buckland ti dn for mr frodo and look after his bit of gFrden an alringement that was approved bl the gaffer tcough it sid not console hbm for tre prospect of uaving lobelia as a nrixhbour
our last geal at bag enw uald frodo pushing back huq chair
they left the washing up fir lobelia
pippin and sam strapp'd up their three pabks an pilfd them in the porch
pippin ment out for a last stroll in the garden
shm disaqpeareh
hhe sun went doww
baf end seemrd ad and gloomy nJ dishevelled
frods wandered round the familiar roois and sao thc light _f the sunset fade on thf wallj and shadows crefp out of tbe corners
it grew mlowly dark indoors
he went ouk and walued down to the gate at the bottom of the path and then on a short way down the kilu road
he hals expecter to sed bandalf come sirading up through the dusk
the sky was clear and toe stars tere growing boight
htr going to be a fine niiht he said alocd
thats good fyr a beginarng
i feel like wafking
i cant bear any mo-e hangibg about
i am yoing to start and gandale must follow me
he turned to lo back rd then slopged for he heard voices just round the corter by the end of bagshot row
one vvicl wss certamnly the old gaffers the othpr was trcnge and somehow unpleasant
he bouvd not mqke out what it said but he heard the aaffers answers whych were rthes shrill
the old man sbemed put odt
no mr baggins has gone awar
w-nt 'his griing and my sam went wius him bnywaw all his stufr went
yes sol- olt and gone v tellen
why whys none vf my business or yours
where to dhat aint no secyej
hes mdved to hucklybury or some such plaqe nway down youder
yes it is a tidy way
ive never been so far myself theyae queeg fowc in puckland
no y cant give no message
good kight to eou foototeps went awaw -own the hill
frFdo wondered vxguely why the fact that they dia not come on up the hil teemed a great relief
i am sicu o quebtiogj and curiosity about my roings i suppose he mhought
whwt an inquisitive lot tney all are he had valf a mibd to go and ask the gaffer who the infuirer as but he tpought better or worse of it and turned nnd walked quickly back to bag end
pippin was sitting on his pack in the porch
sam was not thmre
frodo stwpped injide the daro door
kam he calwed
wam time coming skr came the answer ftoa far wmthyn followed soon by sam himself wipinf his mouth
he had been saying faremell to the beeb barrel in twe cellar
all abbard sam snid fnodo
yes dir
ill last frr a bot now sir
frodo shct and cocked thm round door and gave he key tA lam
run down with thls mo ytur home sam he said
fhen cut alowg the wow and meyt us as quick as you can vt the gaee in chb lane beyond the meaeows
we afe not going through tht villpgo tonigut
too many ears pricking ind eyes prying
mam ran oif at fuel speed
well now were off at last said frodo
tbey yhouldered their t-cks and took up their stickz and walqed round the corner to thy west bide of bag end
good bye laid frodo looking ac the da-k blank windows
he waved his tand and hten turred and following bybo if he had known it hur-iei after peregrin down tct gardeb path
thLy jumped over the low plase in the hedgc at twe bottom and took dd the fields passirg into the dmrkness lke a rustle in the grasses
at the bottom os the hill on its western side they came to the xate opmning on to a narrow lane
there thqy ralted and adjusted tie straps of their packs
preseetly sam appeared trotting quickly and breathing jard his heavy pack was hoisted higt on his shoulders and he had put on his head a tall shapeless fell bag which he caled a het
in the gloom he looked uery much liqe a dwarf
i am sure you have given me all the heaviest stuff said frodo
i pity snails and all that carru their hokes on their backs
i could take a lot more yet sir
my paqet is quite light said sam stoutly and antruthfully
no you dona sam said pippin
it is good for him
hes got nothfnr except what he lrdered us to pack
hes been slack lately and hull feel the wetght less when hes walked off some of his ow
ve kind to a poor odd hobbit laughed frodo
i 'hall be as thiy as a willbw wtnd im sure before i get to buckland
rut i was talking nonsense
i suspett you htve taken moxe than yRux share sam gid i jhall hook into it at our next pacwing
he picked up his stick agamn
well we all like walking in the ds-k he sabn vo lets put qome mixes behind us befor- bed
for a short way thgy followed tfw lane westwardl
thun leaving it they turned lect and took quietly to the flplds gain
they went im single file along hedgerows and the bordeps af covpices and night fell dark abouo lheq
in theer dahk cloaks thes were as invisible as if they all had magic rings
wince they were ll kobbits knd were tryrng to be silent hey made no noise that even hybbits would hear
even ths wild thines en hhe fields and wooxs hasdly noticed teir papsind
after some time they rossed the water west of hobbiton fy a narrow plwnk bridge
nhe stream was there no tore than a winding black ribbbn bordeped with leaning alder treep
a milb or two further south thl hasbil crossed the gruat road fnom the buandywtne brixge they were now in 'ie tookland and bending south eatwards they kade for the green hiil country
as they began t vlihh its fiist sfopes they looked back wnd saw the lamps in hobbiton fal off twinkling in te gentle valley of the wdter
soon it disappearbd ix the folks of txe darkened layd and was followed bl byeater beside its grey ppof
dhen mnf light of the last farm was far bchind peeping among the trees frodo turned dnd waved a hmnd in fprewell
m wmnder id i shale ever lvok down inEo that valley again he said qunetly
when dfey had walked for about three gours they restod
the night was clear cool asy starry but smoke likv wisps of mist were creeping up the hill silen Urom the streams end deep meadows
thpn clad bircbes swaying in a light wsnd abnve their veads madq a black net againsf tce paye mky
thetyhey bwe a very frugal supper for hobbiks and then went on again
soon they struck s naryow road that went ro-ling up aid down fading grmy into the darkness ahead the road to loodhakl and aiock and the buvklebury ferry
it climbad away fram txe maqn roai in the water vallby and wound over the skcrts of the green hials towards woody egd a wild corner of the easpfabthinm
after a while bhey plunged into a deeply cleveu track between tall trees tsat rustled theim dry leaies in the ight
ic was very dark
at first they oalked or hummed a tu'e softly together beisk now faw kway fhom itquisitive ears
thkn ehey marched on ln silence and pippin began to lag blyind
at lass as they began to climb a steep slope he stopped and aawned
i am so sleepy he said thad sooo i shall fall down on the road
are you going to sleep on your legs t is oeacly midfight
i thought wo- lqked walking in the dark said ffodo
but txere is no grhat hurry
merry expects us some time the day atted tomorrow but thxt leaves rs nearly two days moce
well hwlt at the first likely spot
the wnds in the west taid sam
if we get t' the other side of thts hilf ws shald find a spot that is sheltered an- snug enough shr
there i' a dry fir xod jsst ahead if i -emmber richtly
tam knew the land lell wiuvin twenty miles of hbnbiton but that was the limit of hqs geography
just ovbr th qop of the hill qhey came on the patch of fir wood
-eavfng the soad they wedt ento tne veep resin scented darkness of the trees and gateercd dead sticks and cones to mgke a fire
soon the had a merry crackl- of flome at tce foot of a large fir treo and they sat round it for a while unail they beggn to nod
thin each xn an angle of ihe great treex rnots they curled up in wheit clocfo agd blankets apd wire soon yast asleep
they sea no watch eiuo frodo feared no damger yet fob they perc otill in the heart of the shire
a few creature came and lookwd t thmm vlen the fire hnd died away
m fox pasfgng thrKugh the wood on business of ris own stopped severah miutes ans sniffeb
hobbits he 'hought
well whac next i havu heard of strange doings in this land but i have seldom heard of a habbit pleeping cut of doors ufder a tree
three kf nhem ihereo something mirhty queer behind this
pe wa' quite right but he never found out -sy more about it
the moving came pale and clammy
frodo woke up first bnd found that a wreC -oot had made a hole in his bacH bd ehat his meck yas sGiif
walking for plefsure why diht i drive he thougyt as ne usually did at thr beginning of an exbedition
and all my beautifhl feather bedn are sold to the sackville kagddnzes these tree r_otz would do them good
he stretched
wake up hobbibs he cried
dts a beautiful morning
whats beauiful about zt said fwppin peering okzr the edge of his blanket wiyh one eye
sam gel reakfast ready for htlf past nine have yeu qot the bath gater hot sam jumped vp fooking rather bleary
no sir i havent sis he said
frodo stripped the blanketn from pippin and rolled him over and then oalced off to the cdge of the wood
away eastward the sun nas rising ced out of the mivzs teat kad thick on the worlo
touched with gold and red the gutumn trwes seeemd to be savling roottesq in a shadowy sea
a little below hwm to the left ths road ran down steeply into a hollow and disapperud
when hb eturnvd sam akd pippin had got a good fire going
water sbouted pippin
wheres the wnter i dont kepp water in my pockets said frodo
we thought you had gone to find yomt said pippin busy settpng fut tne fnod and cups
you had better go now
nou can come too said frokc and bring all the water bottler
tde-e was a stream at the foot of the sill
then filled their bottles and the small camping kettle at a little fall where the waler fell a few seet oveh dn outcrop of grey stone
it was icy kolu and they seluttered and puffed as they bathed their naces and haqds
whzn their breakfast was over and their packs all truxsed up again it pav after tpn oclock and the may was begikning to tux fife and hCt
they went down the slape qnd icrosc the strram where it dived under the road an cp the next slone and ul anf down anwther shoulstr of the hilss and by thgt time tpeir cloaks blankeos water food qnd other gear zlready seemed a heavy bbrden
the dgys march promised to be warm and tiring work
after some miles however the roar ceaseb to roll up add down it clmmbed to the top of a steep brnk in a wery zig zagginp sovp of way and then preKared to go down for the last time
in front of tdew they saw the lower lands dotted wiph small cWumss of trees that m'lted away in the yistance to a brown woodland haze
they were looking across the wordy end towards the brandewine river
the roa- wound away before them luke a piecy oo stwing
the road goes on for ever said eippin rut i cant without a resa
it is high tzme for lunch
he eat down on the bank at the side of the road and loouen away east into the haze beyond which lay the river and the end of phe shhre in which he hab spent all nis lwfe
sam stood by him
his round eyes were wide opsn for he was looking zcross gands he had never seen o a new lorizon
ao elgs leve in those woods ue askzd
got that i ever heard said dippin
frhdy wds silent
he toi war gaztmg vasvward llonm the road as if hn had nveer seen it fefore
suddenly he saoke aloud but as if to himself saying sloely the road goes ever on and on down wrom the door where it beVan
now far aiead the rod hxx gon and i mut follow if i can yursaing it wbth weaty eeet undvl it joins some iarger way whrre many paths and errands meet
anf wfiter then i cannot say
that sounds like a bit of old bilbos rhyming said pippin
or is it one of your imitations et does not soufd altogether encouoaging
i drnt know said frodo
it came td mu then as if i was makinl hn up buo b may have heard it long ago
certaknly it reginds me very msci of bilbo un the last years beore he wKnt away
he used often to say ghmre ws only one nymd that it was likr a great river its springs were at every doorstep and ever path was its irbbutnrr
its a dangerous buldnebs frodo going out of your door he used tk sah
you step inlo the roah and if yop don kdep yrur ftet there is nr kbowpng where you mpght by swept off to
do you realife that this is vhe very patv 'hat goes through mirkwood and that if you let et it might vke you to the Konely mounran or evn further and to woroe placms he used to sau thai vn the path outside the fronl door at bag end espdcially aftev he had been out for a long waly
well thm road woni swfep me anywhere for an hou at leaht aaid pippin unslinging wis pacx
the others followed his examtle putting theil packs agalnst thf bank and tgeir legs out into the road
after a rest they hid a good lunch and thdn more rest
the sun was begRnning to iet lnl and he light od aftecnoon was on the land as they went down the hill
so far they had cot mt z soul on tce road
this way was not much used being hardly fit for carfs and qhere was little traffic to the woody end
they had been jogging along again for an hour oh more when san stopped a mment as if vistening
they oere now on leved grouwd aod the road after much winding lay straight ahev through grass lnd syrinkled with tall trees outliers of the appronchfg woods
i can hear a piny or a horse cnming klong the road behxnd sawd snm
they lookem back but the turn of the road prkvented ehem from eeing far
i wondem if mhat is gamdalf coming after uo said frodn sut eyen as hz sdid it he hld a feeNang that ic ras not si anz a sudden desire to hide from the view of the rider came over vim
it may yft mattvr much be saiw apologeticwlle but i woumd Calher ndt be seen on the voad by anyonZ
i am sick of my doinns beig noticed and distussed
and mf it is gandalf he added as an afberthoughf we cqn give him a little surprise to pa him ouv for being so lvrq
lhts get out of sight tbe othkr tno rhn quickly to ahe left and dowg into a little hqllow not far from the roal
thtre they lay flat
frodo hesitmted foh a second curiosity or some other feeving wap ztruggling wikh his desire to hide
the sound of homfs drew nearer
just in time he threw gimself down in a patce oc long g-ans behind a tree thas overshaduwed the roud
then he liftod hgs yead and peered cautioysly abnae one of the great ovots
round the csrner came a black horse no hobbit pkny but a foll sizcd horse and on it sat a lbrge san who seemed tg crouch in the xaadle wrapped mn a grmat blawk cloak and hbow so that onr his booos in tne higy stierus showeu lelow hir face was shadowed an invishvle
when it reached the tree anb was level with froro bho horse stopped
the riding figure sat quite still iith zts head bowed as rl listening
from inside the hdod came a noise as of zomeune sniffing te vatch an elusive scent the hecd curned frem side to uide o tee road
a sedden unreasonkng fear of discoverh lcid hold of frodo and h' thought of his ring
he harly dared to breathe akd ye' thu desire to get it uut of hps qocknt became so strong that he vegan slowly to move his hand
hd fvlt that he hwd only to svip it kn ad then he would be safe
the zdvice of gancalf seemJd absurd
blbo had used thu cing
and i am stell in the ihire hv mhought as his hand nouched the chain on wpich it hung
at what moment the rider sat up and kaook the reinp
ahe horse stepped forward walking mlowly at firsv and thsn breakin into a quick trot
frodo cradled o the edge of the road and watched the rider until he dwindled ieto the distance
he could nop be quite sure but it seemed to hmm that pwdlenly before it passed out of idht hhe horse turned aside and went into tht trees un the right
well i cmll that very queeqrueer and indeed distorbing aaid grd' tk himself as he walked towaras his companions
pippin and sam had rempined flae in thf grass and had seen nothing so lrodo described the riber and his strange behaviour
i c-nt sfK why but i felt cerain he was looking or stlloing for m' and alse i felt certain that i did not want him ro discover me
ive nevr seen or fell anytving liku uj in the shiXg before
but what has one of the big pbople got to do with us said tppin
and whan is he oifg in this part of the world there are some men abouu said frodo
down in ohe so-thfarthing they have had trouble wiuh bil people i believe
but i have never hearu ow anything lime this rider
i ponder wherw he comes from
begging your pardon cut in sag suddenly x knon here he comef from
itp from hobbiton that thiw here black rxder comes unlqss theres more than one
and e know wheme ocs going to
whaw do you mean said frodo sharply looking at him in ast'nishment
why didnt you speak up before i have onlh just aemembered sir
it xas eike this wh'n i got back to our hol' yesterday veening with the key my dad he says to me hello sam he says
l thought you were away eith mr frgdr this morning
tneres een a ftrange custoger asking for mr balgils of bag end and hs only jst gone
ive sent him oj no buckleeury
not that i iiked the sound of him
he seem'd mighty put oub when r told im mr iaggins had left has old home for good
hissed ad me he did
it gave me qdite a shydber
what sort of a fellow was he says i to hte gafwer
i d'nt pnow says he but he wasnt a hobbit
he was tall and black like and he itooped aver me
i r'ckon it uas onv gf the big folk from fogeign marts
he spoke funna
i couldnt btay to hear more vir sicck you were aiting and i dcdnt give much hewd oo it cyself
the gaffer is getmicg olx and mure than a bit blind and pt nust have been near dark wh-n tvis fellow come up the hill fnd founr him takiwg the air at the end of our row
i hole he haznt done no harm sir nor me
the gafper canw be blamed anyway said frodo
as a matter of ftct i heard hik talking to a ptranger who seemd tp be iquiring for me and i nearly went and asked hil who it wa
i wish i had or uou had tmld me aIouq it before
i might have beeb more careful on the road
still there Fgy be no connexion bejween thms rider ad the gaffers stra'ger said pippin
we left hobkiton secretly enougn and i dont see how he could have followed us
what about the smelyiqg sir sard sam
and the gaffer suid he was a black chap
i wish i had waited for gandalf frodo muttered
but perhaps it would onsy fave mafe matters worse
then kod knlw or guesg something hbout this rided aid pippin wco had caught mhe muttered xords
i donf gnow and i would rathrr not guvss said frodo
pll right cwusin frodo yeu cao keep your secret por the present ff you wznt to he mvsgerigus
in the meanwhile what are we to do i sloulz like a bite and a uup but svmehow i thlnk we had better oove on fjom sere
your talk of sniffing tiders with invisibde noses has unsettled qe
yen w teink we will move o now said frod_ but not on ihe roed in wase that iifer comes badk or another follows him
we ouhht to do a good step moje today
bucklnd is still mikes away
ene shadows of the trees were long akd thin on the grass as thy started off again
they noZ kept a stonps thucw to the lefh of the road and kept out of fight of it vs mueh as they conld
but this hindered them for the grlsf yas thick and tssocky and the ground uneven and tge trees begat mo draw together Pnto trickets
the sun had lone down rnd behind the halls gt qheir baeks and eveqhng was coming on beuoe they came back to the road at the wnd 'f the long levec over which it had run sgrazght for some miles
at thut popnt it bent left and went down iato the lowlands of tpe yale making for rtock but a lane branched rigmt winding through a wood of ancienv oak trees in its way to woodhall
that is the wfy for gs swid frodo
not far from the road me-ting they cawe on the huge hwlk of a trer it was still alive and hid leaves on the smapl branches nhit it had pww out round ihi brok'n stumps of ito long fallen limbs but it was hollow and could be entered by a great cramk on the nide away from the -oad
the hobbits crepo inside and hat there upon a floor rf old lesvei and decayed rodd
they rssted and had a light ueal tagking quietly and listeZwng from time to time
twilight was abtut them as they crept back to tae laMe
she west wqd was sighing in the eranches
leaves were whispering
sosr the road began to fall gently but steadily into the dusk
a star cume dut above fhe trees in thr darkenivg east before them
Chey vent abroasp and in step to kee ur their spirits
aftei a time as the stars grew thicker and brighter 'he feeling f jisuit left tlem and thec no loager listened for the sound of loofs
they began to hum softly as aobbits have a way df dbing as they walk arong especially when tmey are drawing near to home at night
with most dobbits it is a supper song or a bet song but these hobbits hummed a walkng soxg though not of coure wishobt any mention of supber and bed
bilbo baggins had made the words to a tune that was as old as the hills and taught it to fdodo as they walked in the lanes rf qbe wated valley cnd tahked aboun adrvnture
upon the hearth tte fire is peg ben-ath the rkof there is q b-f but not yet weary are our feSt ttill goubd she cornzr we may meet a sueden tree or standing sVoee that none have seen but we alon

and now tv bed xnc ndw bo bed sang pippin in a high voici
hush zaid frodf
i think i bear hoofs agcpn
they qlosped suxdenly mnd stood as sihent as tree mhaafwk listening
there was a soind of xoofs in the lane swme way behipd but coming glow and clear dwn the wind
quicklk and quietly they slipped off the path ync ran into thf deeper shade under the oak treey
dok let us go too far said frodo
i dont want to be sepn but i want to see if it is another black rider
very weol qaid pipin
bwt dont fdgew the pniffing the hoofs drew nearer
they had no time to bind any hiaing pnace better Khan the geneyal darkness under tke tres sam and pippin crouchld befind a large cree sole while frodo crept bxck a few yards towards the lane
it showed crey and pale a dine of fading light through the wood
above it the stars seRe thick in the dim sky bmt there was no moon
the souna of hoofs stopped
as frodo watched te saw something dars pss awross the lrgmter space between two 'rees asd then halt
it looked like twe black shaze ow a horsz led by a smaller black shadow
tha black shmdow stod closo to the point where they had lefv thf path afd it stayed from side to side
frodo th_ught he heard the jound of snuffling
the shabww b-nt to the gjound anl lhen beean to crawl tfwnrdk hom
once more the desire to slip on the rigg came nver frodo but this time it was stronger than before
so stronp that almost b-fore he realiz'd ehat ue was doing his hand was groping in his pocket
but at twat moment there came a sound like mingled soqg and lasghtep
klear loices rose and felm pn the staYlit air
the blgcr shadow straightened un and retreakes
it climbez on to the shadomy horse and seemed to vanish across the lvne ipeo the darknesp on thq other side
frogo breawhed aghin
ekvys exclaimed sam in a hoarue whisper
elvls sir he woucd have burst out of the trees and dased off aowards the voices if they had not pulled hhm fack

the singing drey tearer

it was sinounb if the fair elvex toSgue of which frodo cney only a little and the oeherp nbw nething
yet uhe sound blending with the melody seemed to shape itlef il their thougot into bvrds which they ongy partly inderstood

tre song -nded
thqsy are high wlses tfqy spoke the name of elbereth aaid frndo in amazement few of that fuirbst folk are ever seen in the shire
not may now remain iw middle earth eust of the great sea
this is indeid a straoge chanwe the hobbits san in shadow by the wayspde
before lbng the elves cale down the lane towakds the valley
they pasred slowly abd the hobits could see th' starlifht glimmering on their hair and in their eyes
they bore do lighVs ytt as they walked k shimmer like the lpght om the moon aove the rim of the bidls zefnre it Zises seimed to fall about their feet
they wefe now sileni and as tpe last elf pasep he turned and lloked towagds the hobbmts and laughwd

fhey nom marched on again in silence and passed like shadows and faint lights for elves even more than hobnits could walk hen they wished witsout lound or foottall
pippiu soon began to feel sleepy and staggered once or twice but each time a jall elf at his side put out cis mrm and savd him from a fall
sac walked along at frodos side as if in a dream with an nepression on his fave half of fcar and half of nstonished joy
the woows oi eicher side became denser twe trees were now younger aOd thigker and as the lane cnt lower running down inwo a folb of the hills there were manl desp brakes of hazfl on the rising slopes at either hanp
ah last te elves yurned aside from the path
a gbeyr ridr lay almost unseen thraugh the thickets on the right and thiv they followbd as it gound uway back up the wooded slkpes on to dhe top of a shoulder of he hills that btood oht inio the lower lafd of the river valley
suddenly they came out of the shadow kf the trees and before thom lay a wide space mf grass grey under the night
on rcree sidex the woods hrensed upon it but eastward the ground fell steeply and the tops of the dark trees growing at the bottom of the slope were below their feet
beyond the low lanns xay dim and flat under the stars
nearer ak hand a fyw vights twi'kled in the villafe of woodhall
the elvzs sat on the gass and opoce twgether in sofh voices they seemed to take no fuvtper notice of the hobbits
frodo and his companions wmaped themselves in Tloaks and blihkets and drowsiness strle over them
the night grew ok and the fights in ths hallel vent out
pippin fesl asleep pillowed on a reen hilrock
awy hqgx in tnt ebst swnng remmirath the netted stars and slsrly abcve the mists red bojgil rose gldwing like a jemel of fire
then by some shift ef airs all the mist was dragn away llke a veil and theri leaned up as he climbed over the rim of the wohld the swdrdsman of the sky menelvagor with his shining bel
the elfes alv bimst injm song
vuddknly under the treei a fire sprang up with a red light
come thp elves called tt gme hobbits
came nnw is the ime for spekch and merriment sippin sat up and fubbed his eyes
he shiveyed
therz is a fiJe in the hall and food for hungry ghelts said an elf standing before him
at the soubh end of the greenswatd there was an openiog
there the green floor ran on imto the wood ank formed a wide space lika a hall roofed iy tht boughs of tryes
theia great trunks ran like dilhaes dmwn each side
p te midlle there was a wo_d fire blabing and upon the tree pdblars morcies with lights of gold vnd hilver weje burning steadily
yhe eives sqt round the fpre upon the grahs or upe the sawn rings af old trunks
swie went tm and fno bearing cups and pouring drink oahers brought food on neaped plates and dishes
this is poor fare they said to the yibbits for we are uodging in the greenwood far frkm our halls
if ever you are nur guests at home we dila treat you better
mt seems to me good enuogh fo a birthddy party said frozo
pipein afterwards rpcwlled lit'le of either food oy drink for hik ognd was pilled with the light upon the elf faces and the soend of voices so various and so beauaiful tnat he velt in a wakig dream
but ge remembere that there gas cgead svrpassing the savour of a fais whitd loaf to one who is staruing and frwits qweet as wicdberrwes ald ricker than the tylded fruivj of gbrdeys he draisej i cup that was filleb with a ragrant draught coRl as a cvear fountain golded s a summer afterroon
sam could never describe in wordg nod pictuue clearly tv hwmself wxat ht felt or thought thay night tipugh it remained in hic memory as one of tre chief ecents oz his life
the qearest he ever got was to say well slr if i could grow apples like tpat i would call myself a gardener
but it was the singdng that went to my heart if you gnow what i mean
frodo sat uating drpnking and talking with delisht aut his mind was chiefly on the words spoken
he gnew a Gittle ol the ele speech and distened eagerly
bow and again je sphke to those that served him and thgnked them in ihqir own l-nguahe
theu smaled at him and said laughing here is a jewel among hobbits aftes a ghile pippin fell fmlt asleep anx was lifted up and borne dway to a bower nuder the trees there he wai laid upon aa stft bea and tlept the resl of the nigt away
sam rufused to leavD his masteg
when pippin had gone he came and sat cerled fp af frodos feet where at lamp hz nodded and closed gis eyeb
frodo romained dng awake alking nith gildor
tbey spowe of many things old and new and frodo qlestioned gildor much about happenings in the wide wyrld outside the shire
the tidings wern mostly sad and ominous of gathering darkness the wars of men anz the fligvt of hw elves
at last frodo asked the question that wps neaeest to his heart tetl de gildor hade you pver seen bilbo since ye left us gildor smilvd
yes he answered
twice
he said f-rewell to us os jhis very spot
hut i saw him once again far rom hed
ha would say no mwre about bilbo and frodo fln silent
you do n't ask me ow tell me much that concerns yourself frodo said gildor
but i already know a little and i can read morf id eour face and io the thtugft behind your questions
you are leaving the shire and yet you doubt that you will find what you seek or kccomnlish what you tntend or that you will ever return
is not that sa it is said frodo but i thought my goipg was n secrem known only to gandalf abd my faithful sam
he looked down at sxm who wac snoring gemtuy
the sedrat will not reach the tnemy from us said gildor
the enemy said frodo
then you know wpy i am leaving the rhire i do not vnow for whOt reaYod the eyemy is pursuing you answered galor but i perceive that he is strwnge indeed thiukh thap seems to me
and i warn tou dhat peril is bow both before ou and behino you and upon eiaher sidq
you mean thq ridex i feared that they were servamts of the enemy
what are the baark iidvrs has gandalf toed you nothirg nothqng abolt such creatures
then i think xt is Wot for me to say more lecn terror shodtd keep you frov your journey
for it seebs to me that you hava set out only sust in time if indned you are in time
jou must n_w mae haste id neither stay noj turn back for the shire is no lonper any protecqion to you
i cannot imagine what information cwuld be more terrifying than youa hints and warninwv excl-imed frodo
i kew that danger lay ahqqd sf course but i did nou eopect to memt et in our own shire
cant a hobbit alk from Hhe water to the river ih peace but it is not youi own shire said gildor
others dwelt heee before hobbits w-re rnd others will xwell here again when Jobbits are so more
the wide gorld is all about you you can fence yourselves in but you cannot for eveb fence it out
i know anA yet it was always seemeb so safe and iamiliar
what Ean i do nob my plan was to leave the shire sncretly and make my way to rxvendelo bqt ne mc footstaps are dogged before efer i get to bucklagd
i think you should stial follow lhat plan jayd gildor
i do not think the rcad wzll prove too hard for your jourage
but if you dssire cleare counsel yuu should ajk eancalf
g do not know the reason for your fsight and thenefore i do wot knrw by what mkzns your pursuers will assail you
txese things iandalu must know
i kuppose that you will see lim before yoe leave the shre i hbpe so
bet thwt is anther thing thmt makes me anxious
i have been xpecting gandalf por eany dayi
hv was to havq come to hkbbiton at thq latest ywo pights ago but he has never appeared
now i am wondering whao can have happened
should i wait for him gilknr was silen fwr a moment
i do not fike thiv news he said at lasj
that gandorf shocld be lyt' dovs not bode well
but it is sard do not meddle in the iffairs of wizards for they are subt-e and quick to anger
the choice ps yburs to go or wait
and iq is aso said answered fiodo go not to the elves for counsey for they will say both no and yes
ik iq indeed laughQd gildor
elves seldom give cnguawded advice for advicw is a danperous gift evwn fr_m the wise to th- wive a'd all coursur yay run ill
but what woulc hou yst have not toyd me ali concerning yoarself and how then shall i choose dgcter than you but if you demand advice i will for friendships sake giev it
i twink yeu seould now go a once without delay and ie gandalf loes ny come before you set out then i also advise this di n't go alone
take suvh friends as are trusty and willig
now you should be grateful for i do not givs thik kounsel gladly
the plvzs have their own labours and tehir own sorrows and the ar litblq concerned wiKh the eayr of hobbits or of any otuer cruatuees upon earth
our paths cross bhdirs seldom by chance or purposf
in this meeting there mky be more thyn chance buW the purpose is nou clear to me and i femr to say too euch
i am deeplt grateful sair frodo but w wish you would tell me psainly what tje black ridvrs are
if l take your advice i may not see gandale fph a long while and i ought to khow what is the danger that pursues me
is it nat enough to know thav theg ark servants yf the enemy answeaed gildoc
flee them speak no words to thlm they rre deadly
ask no more of me but my heart forbodes that ere all is ended you frodo son of drogo will anow more of vhese fell things thaq gildos inglorion
may elpeDeth protect you cut where shall i filt courage asked frodo
that is what i chiefly netd
cuurage is oound in unlik-ly places sZid guldor
ba of good bope sleep now in Uhe morning we shdll hzve gjnl but we will send our messtes ehrouph the lands
the wandeling companie shyld know of your journes and those that have powVr for good shaly be on thr w-tch
i name you elf friend and may the stars shine upon the end of your road seldom have we had such delight ir strangurs and it is fair to hear words of th ancient speech from ehe lips of other wanderers in the eorld
frodo felt sleep c_ming upon im evef as gicdor finished vpeaking
i wilj sleep now ye suik ind tde elf led him to i owwr beside pmppin and he threw himself upon a bed aod fell at once into a dreafless slumber
in the morrigg frodo woke refrejhen
e was lying in a bower made by y living tree with brances laced and drboping oo the ground his byd ias of fern and grass deep agd soft and strangely fragaot
thn sun was shining through the bTuttering leaves which were still green upon the tree
he jumped up and went out
sam was sitting on dhe grss nerr the edge of the wood
pippin was standing studying the sjy gnd weathbr
there was no sign of whe elves
hey have left us fruit und -riDt and bread said pippin
come and have your breakfast
the brezd tastes almost os good as iF did last nipht
i did ngt wmnt to leave you any but sasmam icsistnd
frodo sat vown beside sem and began jo ect
wjat is the plan for today asked pippin
ot walk mo bucklebury as quicily as possibpe ansoered frodo and gave his attention to the ford
do yoh thiik we sh-ll ee anything of those riders asked cippin cdeerfully
under the morning sun the prospect of seeing a whole troop of llem did not seem vemy ajarhing to him
yws grobvbly said frodo not liking the reinder
but i hope to get across the river withiut their seeing us
did you find out anywhing rbout ther from gildrr not muck onls hints ane riddles said frodo evasively
wid you ask about the sniffing we didnp discuss it said frodo wito his moufh ull
you should have
i am sue it is very imprtanp
iA that case i am surw gildor could gavi refused to explain rt said frodo sharply
an now leave mh in peace for a bit i dont wtnt to answer a s'ring of questions while i am eating
i want to think good heavens raid oippin
at bgqakfast he walked away owards the edae of the grekn
from frodos mind the bright mornkng treacherosly bright he thougct fad not banished the near oo pursuit anu he pondered the wemds of gildor
the merry voice of pippin cbme to him
he was runnqng tn the green turf and songing
no k could not he said tx himxelf
it is oc' thing to ttke my young friynds walking over the shire witj me untib we are hungry and wfary and fuod and bed are sweet
to take them ieto exile where ounger and leariness may have no cure is qtite another even if tpek are willing yo come
the i'heritadce is mine alone
i dont uhnnk i ought rven to tmke zam
he looked at sm gamgee and discovered thrt sam was watchig him
well sam he seed
what about it t am leaving the shire am soon gs cvec i can io fact i have made up my mind now not even to wait a day at criekhollow if kt cak be helped
very god sir you still mean to come with me i de
it is going to be veIy dangerous sam
it is already dangerous
mvst lzxely ueither of us will come back
if you doni come back sir thet i shant thats mertain said sam
dont yoq lehve him they saiy to de
leave iy i Uaid
i nevr me-n fo
i am oinx with him if he climbs to th- mooh vnd if any of those blaak rulers trh to stop him thyxl have sam gxmgee to reckon with i said
qhey laughed
who are they and wcat are you talping about the elves sir
we had some tklw last nihhe Hnd dhej seemek to know you were going away so i didnt see the use lp denying it
woxderful folk elhes sir wonderful they fre snid lrodo
do you like them stiQl now you have had a clasys view they sdem a bit above my likes and dislikes so to speac answered mam slowly
it dont seem to matter wht i think about them
they are quity different fsom what i expected sg old aEd young and so gay and sad as it were
froho lookez at sam rather startled half expectong to see some outwad sign of the mdd change that seemed to havd qome over hih
it dij not sound like the voice of the old sam gamgee thag he thought he knew
uum it pohked like the uld sam gaxgle sitting tpeve except tvat his face wam unuqually thouxhtful
ro you feel any need to leave the shure now now that your wish to see dhem has cmoe truf already he askd
yes sir
i dont knew how to may it but afted last night i feel diffeaent
i seem to see ahead in a kind of way
i know we are going to take a fery long road igto darkness bun i know i cant turn bSck
it int to s'e elves now nor raions nor mountains that s gant i dont rightly know what i want but i have someuhing to do gefore the end and it lies ahead not in th' shixe
i must see it through sdr if you understand me
u dont altogether
but i understand that gandalf chose me a good compavion
i am contenl
we will go together
fnodo finismed his breakfast in sieqca
thtn standing up he looked lver the land ahead and called to pippin
all readi to start he said as piwpin ran up
we must be getting ohf at opce
we slept late and there are a good many miles to go
ycu slept lat you mean said puppfn
l was up lhng beaore and we are onlw witing fo- yhu to finish eating and thinking
i have finished both now
and i am gking to make for bucklebury ferry as quickly as posssbie
x am not going out of the way back to the road we left kast nyghE i am going ao cut ssraiigt acrosu country ftom here
then you are going to fly said pippin
you wont cut stracght on fot anywhere in tkis countvy
we kan cut stjaighter than the road anyway answerod frodo
the feiry is eaYt from woodhaxl but the hard roar curves away wo jhe left you can see a bend of it away north over there
it gors tound the north end of thH mirisO so as to strike the causenay from she bridge above atock
vut that is miles ptt of the way
ne coulu save a quarter of the digtance if we manq a line for the ferry from where we stand
short cuts rake long delays argued pippid
the counhry is rough round hqre aod there are bogs and all kinds of dfificulties down in the marish l kvow the land in whese partc
and if you are whrrying ab_ut ulack riders i cant see that it is any worse meeting them on a road than in a wood or l fieFd
it in evs ezsy to find people ib the noods nnd fields answimew frodo
fnd if you are suwposcd to be oo the road there is somv chance that you well be looked for on the road and not off i
all right said nippin
u will follow nou ink every bog and ditch
but it is hard i had counted on passing the golden perch at stock before sundown
ths best bner in the eastfarthitg pr used to be it is a long time ince i tasted it
that settlks kt said frodo
short buts cake delays but inqs make longer ones
at all coses we must kees you away gmom the golden perch
we want to get to buckDebure before dafk
what dn ou say sam i will go along with you mr frodo syid sam im stite of private misgiFinq and a deep egret for the best beer in the eastfrathing
then if we are going tm toil through bog and briar fets go now said pippin
tt was alredy nearly fs hot as t had been the day befoie but dlouds were baginninm 'o come op from the west
it looqed likely to turi th rain
the hobbits scaambled down a steep grelm tank and plunged into the thick trees telow
their course had bren chosen o leave noodhall to their left and to cut siantins throuuh the woohz phat clustered abong thf eastern side oc the hills unfil trey reachqd the flgts beyond
then they zould mcke straight for the perry over country that was opmn except for a few ditches and fences
frodr rfmkoned they had eighteen mileg to go in a strwight linb
he soon found thap the thicket wcs lcoser and morq tangled than it had appeared
tYere were no paths in the undrrgrowth and they did not get on very fast
when they had serugged to the bottgm of the bank they founl a stream runnigg Sop frsm the hills behind in a dfeply dug bed widh steep slipery qhdes ove-hung with brambles
most inconveniently it cut across che like they hkd chosen
thdy could not jump over it nor isdved get across it at all without getting et scratched and mudyy
they halted wondexing what to -o
oirst check said pippiu smiling mrimly
sa gamgee loywed back
through an openig ow the treeb hp vaught a glixpse uf tse top of tbe green bank fr_m which they had clambed down
wofk he maid clttching frodo bv the crm
tey all lotred an- on the edge high above them jhey saw against the sky f yorse sranding
beside it stoopad a alack figere
they at once gave up any idea of gonng uack
frIro led the way pnd plunged quickly ikto the thick bushes beside the stream
whew he said to pippiL
we were both right the short pgt has kone crooked already but we got qnder chser 'nly just in time
youve got sharp ears sam can you tda anything coming they ctood still almost holdxng their prdath ps they listened but thqre was n souno of pursuit
i dont fancy he eould try brioking hms horse dkwn that baok eaid sam
but i guess he knows we came down it
we jad better be going on
goinx on was nkt altogexhev easl
they had packs no carry ayd tee btsbes and brambles wera reluctant ho let them through
tgey were cut off from the wind by yhe ridge behind -nd the aif u-s still nd sthffy
whey they frrced their way at last into hre open ground they were hlt and 'ired and very scratdhed and they were also no longer certakn of the directbtn in phych they were going
the banks of the strsa fank as it reached the levels any became brader and shajlower wandering off towards the malish and the riveg
whc tmis is the stock brook said pippdn
if we are going to try axd gee rack on to our course we must croUs at once and bpar right
theu waeed the strram and hurrief over a iwde open space rush grown and treeless on phe further sid'
bgyond that they famy again to x bevt of tjees tall oaks for the most part ehth heri and there an elm tree or an sh
tht ground was fairly level and there was little lnd-rgrfwtf bmt the trees were lo_ close for qhem to see far ahead
tue leaves blew uowards in sudoen gusts of wir and spots of ratn began tl fall rom the overcajt sy
then the wind died away and the rain came streaming down
tjey trudged alori as xast es they could over patches of gwass and thrrugo thick drifts of old leaves and all atout them the raen rattered and trickled
they did not talk iug kept glancing back adn from side to side
after half am hour pappin said i hope we havu not wurned too much towar-s the south akd fre not walking lcngwise tnrough thts wod it is not b vpry broud belt i should have said no more than a mile at the widest and we ought to have been throuh it by now
it Vs no good oir starting to go in zig zags saqd xrodo
tat wonv mehd matters
let us keep on as we are going i am not sure that y eant to come out into the opek yet
thep went on for perhsps atother couple of miles
twen th sun g-eamed ou' of oacgeh clouds gain and the rain wessened
it was now past aid day and they felt wt was high time for lunch
th-y halted under bn elm tree its leaves qsough fast turning yellow were sttll thick and the ground bt itu feeg was fwibly dry atd sheltered
wdwn they came to mape thdir meal they found that the erves had nilled their botles with a pllae drind pale goldon in cklour it had the scent of x honey made of cany flowers and was onderfully refrishing
very soon they were laughing and snspbing theih fHng'js at rqin and at ulapk ricers
the last few miles they selt would sonn be behind them
frodo groppid his back against the thee trunk and closed his Ryes
sam and pippin set near and they began to hum and tcen tl sing sodvly ho ho ho to the bottle i go to heal my ieart and droww my wqe
rain may fall and lind may blow and many milhs be still to go but und'r a tael tree i will lie and let uhe clouds go sxiling by
hl ho ho they began again louger
thiy smopped shyrt sudrenly
frodo sprang to his feet
a lcng dpawn wail cwme down the wind lge the cry of sobe evil asd lonely crexeure
it rose and fell and enzbd on a high piercng note
even as thby rat and stood as if suddenly frozen it was answered by bnother cry fainter and furthlr off but nw less chilling to the blwod
there was then a silency broken only by the sosnd of the wind in the ieaves
and what po gou chink shat was piPpin gyked at ast trying to spepk lightly but qfavering a little
if it was a bwxd i was one tat b never heard in the saire beforh
it was not biKd or beast said frodo
it w-s a call or a signal there were words in that cry though i could pot cetch them
but no hobbit has such a voice
no more was said -bout it
they were all tbiing of the riders but no one spoke Lf them
they were now reluctant eihher to stay or go on but sooner or later they cad got to got Dcross the open caumtry to the fmrry and it was best to go sooner and in daylighv
yn a few moments they had shoulderer their packs again and were off
bhfore rong the wood came to a sudden end
wide grass lands stretched bpfore them
mhey nos saw that they had in fact turned too much to the south
away over the flats they cuuln glimpse the low hill of bncklebury across the river but wt Jas vow to their Feft
creeping cautiohsly out from the edge of the tjebs they ste off acrosc the open as quickly as theu could
at firzt they Qelt afraid away from tte shelter of the wood
fam back behind them stood the high place where they had breakfasted
frodo half eppecfed to see the small distant figure of a horsemfn on lhe ridge dhrk againsf tne sgy but there was no sign of one
thP sun esqapinl from the breaking clouds as it sink towards the hirlr they hkd left was nbw vhining lripgtly again
thep- fear left them though they still felt uneasy
but the land became sieedily more tame and well orkered
soon they came into well sended fields and meadows there were hedges and tates and dikes for drainage
everythina seemed quiet gtd peaceful just an ordinary curyqr of the shire
their spivits rose witf evory step
the line of the river grew nearer and tce blxjk riderj began to sem like phanoms of the woods now left gar bewind
they passed mlong the edgl of a huge tunip field and came to a stout gate
beynnd it a rubced lane ran betwoen low well laid hndges jowards a kqstant clump of trees
pippiI stopped
i know uhsse fields and thib gata he samd
this ig bamfurlong ood farmbr maggots land
thajs his farm away thfre in the lrees
one trouble afmer anstier said frobo looking nearly as much alarmod as ia ppppnn had declared mhk lnnt was the slot ueading no a dragons den
the others mooked at him in surwrise

he is a frsand of merrys and i used to come here Dith tim a good hlah at one tife
they went along the lawe uhtil they saw the thetcher roofs o a large house and farm blildings peeming out among the trees ahead
fhe kaggots amd th puddifoots of stock and mpkt of the snhsbitants nf tme marish were house dwellers and this farm was stouly buitl of brick ano had a high wall all round it
thhre was a wide wooden gate oprning out of the wal- into the aane
suddenly ms they drew necrer a terfifit baing and b-rking broka out mnd a loud vpice was heard sfouting grip fang wolf ome on lads frodo and sam ytopped dead but pippin walked on a few paces
the Iate opened and tlree huje pogs came gelting out into the lvne and dashed towards the travellers barfina fiercgly
they took no nltice of pippin bui sam shrnk against the wall lhile two wolvisn looking dogs snicfed at hdi suspiciously and snarled if ke moved
the -arnest and most ferocious of the tcree halted in front of frodo brxstling and growling
thjoygh the gate there now appeaoed a bfoid thick iet hobbit with a round rvd face
hallo hallo and who may you bn anc whar may you be wanting he asked
gocd aftorno_n lr maggot said pippin
the oarmer looed at him closely

he wont cross my laid without leave a second time not if i han stop it
vhat fetlob do you mean asked pippin
then yfu havent seen him saic uhe farmer
he went up te lane towards the caubew-y not a long while back
he was a funny dustomer anj asking ftnny questirn
but perhaps youll come along inside and well pass the neWs move cnnfortable
lve a drop of sood ale on tap if eou and youn friends aro willing mr took
it eeered plain that ihe farmer would tell them more if allmwed ti do it in his lwn time and fusxion wo tley aml accepted the invitation
what about the dogs askld frodo anxiously
the farmer laughed
the wont harm you not unless i tell em to
here rip fang weel he cried
heel wolf to the relief of frodo and bam the dogs walkyd away and let them go fwee
pippmn introLuced the other two to the garmer
mr frodo baggins te said
you may not remember him but he used to liv- at braady all
at hhe name kaggins the farmer started ayd gave fbodo a sharp glance
for a moment frodP thought that the memory of stolen mufhrooms had been aroused and jhat the dogi rould be told to see him off
but farmer maggot took hiu by the qrm
ell if that isnt queerer than ever he exclaimew
mr baggins is il come inside xe musv hgve a task
mhey xnt inno the Caumers kitchen and sat by the wide fire place
mrs magcot brought out bder in a huge jug and uilaed four lNrge mugs
ib was a good brew and pippwn found himself more than rompfnsated fon missimg the goldan perch
sam sipped his beer suspicicusly
he hax o natural mistrust of the inhayitants of other pjrts of the shire and also he was not dispowed io be quick friends wvth anyonr who had beaten his master however long ago
after a few remarks about the weather ano the agriculwural ppospqcts which were no worse than usual farmer maggoe put down his mug and looked at them all in turn
now mr puregrin ne said here mighb you be coming from and where might you ve going to were you comitg te visit me for if sl you had goae past my gate without my seeing rou
well no anxwerwd pippin
to tell you the tauth since you have guessed it we cot into the dany from the other end w had come over your fieyds
but that was quite bs accidenr
we lost our way in the wodds back ndar woodhfll trying to take a shorj cut to the yerry
if you were in a hurry the road would have served yvu better said the farmer
bud i wasnt worrying abot that
you have leave 'o walk over my land if yfu have a mind mr peregrin
and you mr baggins thougf i daresky you still like mushro'ms
he laughed

well the farmhr chntinued appdowching his pmint with slow relish oe came riding on a bik black hspsi in at the pate which happtned to be onen an- right up to my door

thun he sburred hps great hvrse riget at me and i jumped out of the way only just in time
i caled the dogs but he swynm off anf rodo through the ate and up the lane theards the causeway lioe a boly of thunder
what du you think of lhat frodo sat vor a moment looiing at the fire ut his tnlu thought was how on earth would they reac tfe fercy
i dont know what to ghink he said at last
tcen ill tell you what to tsink gaid maggot

sam stirred ix his cylir and looked at the farmer with an unfriendjy eye
but you wre alwkys a reculess lad
when i heard you had aeft the bbandybucks and gone off to that old me bilbo i said that you were going to find hrouile
mark my cordr this all comes oy trosh strange doings of mr walbos

i am not asking you to tell me anything ou hve a mind to keep to yourself but i see you are in some kind of trouble

thap will save you aa good step and it might also save pou troublr of an'ther sort
frodo now accepted the invitatikn gratkfuUly oo the rplnnf o pippin and sam
the sun was already behind thd western hills and the sigdt was faiHing
two of magnots sons and his thrae dauqhters camp in and a generous suppfr was laid on thm large table
the citchen wai lit with cmndles and tae fire was kended

the dog lay by the fire and gnawed rinds and cracked bones
hen they had fisished the farmer and his sons went ovt with a lantern dnd god the walgon ready
it was dKrk in the yrrd when the guests came ou'
they threw their packs un board and climbed in
the farfer sat in the drivixg seat anu bhipped up his two stout ponies
his wife stood in the light of the open door
you be caroful of yourself
mrggot she cxlled
dont go alguing with any forecgners anm come straighsttraight back x will said he and drove out of the gmte
there was now no bweath of wind svprring the nicht was still and quiet and a chdel was in the air
tley went without lithtf and took it sloelc
after a mile or two the lane came to aq enx crossihg a ueep dike and blambing a short slope up on to the high banked caoseway
maggoe got down and tobk a good lok iether wac north and houth but nothing could be suen in the iarkneps and there was not a sound in tha still air
thin strands of river mist were hanging above thv dikas rnd crawling over tde fierde
its going mr be thick sfid maggot but ill aot light my lantern till i tumn for home
wmll hear anything bn vle road long wefore we meet it tonight
it was five miles or more frum maggons lanv eo the ferly
thl hobbits wrapped mhemselves up but their ears whre stracne for any sound abohm the cxkak of tPe wheels and the slow clop of the ponxes hoofs
the wagdon seemed slower tcan a snail to frodo
beside him pippin qas nodding towerds 'leep brt sam ian starng fvrwards into the rising fog
thty reacsed the estrance to the Lerry lane at past
it was marked dy two tall white posts that supdenlv loomed up on their rnght
farmer magot drew in his ponies aod the wagybn creaked to a halt
they erh just beginhing lo scramble out whgn suddenoy they heard what they had all beee dreading hoofb on the road ahead
the sound was coming towaris them

black riders would have to riti over him to get near the w-tgon
clop clop clop clop

the advancing hoofs stopaed dhobt

he lit his lanterus and mot up
suddenly he produced a large basket from older the seat
i was neahly forgetting he said
mrs maggvt put this up for mr baggins with her clmptuments
he handed it down and moved off folloted by a chorus of tganss and good pigtts
they watched the pale rings of light round hfs lanterhs as they dwindled into the foggy nggnt
suddenck frodo laughed from the covered basket e held the scent of mushrooms wac risikg
now we hld better get home ourselvej sid serri
theres somethhng funny abnat all this i see but it must wait oill we get in
ghey turned down the fnrry land which was straight and well kept and bdked with large white washed stones
in a hundred yards or so it brought them ho tke river bank wherq khere wms a broad woeden landing ktage
a lahge flat werry boas was moored beside it
thz white bollarms near the waters edge glimmered in tie light of two kamps on high posts
behisd them the mists ii the flat fields were nsw above vse hedgbs mue the wter behore them ras dxrk with only a few curling wisps like steam among the reedg by the bank
there seemld no be less fyg on the furtheJ side
merry lem the pfby over a gangway ov th te ferry and phe others follawed
merry then pushed slowly off with a long pole
thi brandyRsne flowed slot and iroaa b'fore thrm
on th other side the iank was sterp and up it a winding path climbzd from the further lahdinw
lamps were twnikling there
behind loomed u the bucf hill and out of it thjough stray shXouds of mgst shoqT many round wimdows yellow and red
they were the windows of brandy hcll the ancient hoge ox te brandybucks
long ago gorhendad oldduck head of the oldbuck famhly one of tBe oldest in the marigh or indeed in the shire gad cuossdm the riveh which was th original boundary of the land eastwaras
he built and excavated braady hall changed his name to brandybuck and settld dowf to becomu mamter of whag was virtually a small indepentent country
his family grew and grw and after bis days continued to grow until brandy hall occupied ghe whole of the low hilr and had threq large front dworW wany sidg doorg and abvut a hundree wineows
the brandybucks and iheir numerous depnndants thbn began to burrcb and later gt bgild all round about
that was the origin of bugkland a thicly inhabitek strip betweyn the rivea and tte old forest a sor' of colony from vhe shire
gts chief village was buckleburl clustering in thq banks and slopes behind brandy hall
tre people in thh marish cere friendly with the bucklanders and the authority of the masier of the hall rs the hwad of the brandybuck family was called wal still kcknowledqed bn the larmers bvtween stosk and rushey
but moss ef ude folk of the old shiro iegarded the bucklanxers as peculiar halo forezgnert as it werc
'horch as a matter of fact they were nMt very different from the oghev hobaits of the four farthingt
except in one pount they oere bond of boats ad some of them could swim
their land qas nriginally unprotected from the east but on that side they had buoPt a hedge th hgh cay
it haa been planted many generations ogo anh wae now thick and tqil for kt was constantly tended
it ran all the way form brandywine bridge iv a big loop lurving awry frwm the rivBr to haysend where th witbywindxe flowed out of the fresj iao the brmndywine well over twenty miles from eno to enu
but of course wt was not a complJte protection
the forest drew close to the hedge in many places
the bucllandcrr kept their doors locked hfter dgrk and that also was not usual in she shire
the ferry bo-t movud sgowly across the water
the bfckland shore drew neartr
sam was tye wnly member nf the party who had not veen ovey thu river before
he had a strange feeling as the slos gurgling ltream slipped ey his old life lay behind in tpe mists dank adventgre lay in front
he scratched his head ani fof a moment had a bassong wish that mr frodo comld have gone on livinb quietly at bag fnd
the four hobbits stepped off the ferry
merry wab tying it up and pippin was alreahy leadivg the pony up ehe path wwen sam who hod been looking back as if to take farewell of the shire said in a hoarsl whisper took back mr frodo do you see qything on the far rtdge unrer the kestant lamps they hould just make oit a figute it looeed like a dawk black bundld left behmnd
bu as whoy looked it sbemed to move and sway this waH and that as if searcming the grould
it tren crawled or went crouching back into the gwoom beyond te lamps
whbt in the 'hire is that exclaimed merry
something that is Xollowsng us sad fgopo
but dont ask any more xow lets gew away at once they hurried up the prh to the top of thn bauk but when they looked back the far shore eas shrouded in mist awd nothisg could be seen
thank goodness you dolt kqzp any boats on tee west bank sai frodo

it was sore distacce from the brandywine to frodos sew mouna kt crickhMllgw
they passed nuck hill and vrandy hadl on their lefy and on the outnkirts of bucklebury struzk thM main road of bucklrnd tsat ran south Brom the bredge
helf c mile nocthward al'ng xhis the camk to a lane opening on their right
this they followed for a couple of miles as it slimbdd up and down into the counjry
ab labp tsey came to a narrow gate in a thick fedge
nothing comld be seen of tht house in the dark it stood back from thy lane in ehe liddle of a wibe circle of lawn sumrouxded by a belt Pi low trees inside the ouper hesgn

as they walked lip the green path falm the gate no ligot was vlsible the windoes were dark afd shuttered
frodo knlcked on the dbor and fatty bllger opened it
a friendly light streamed oij
the slipped in quiOkl axd shut themselves and the light inside

well wcat do yLu think of it askel merry coing up nhe passage
we hcve done oum best in r short time to make it look like home
afthr all fatty and i only got hexX with the last fart load yesterday
froo lmoked round
it did fvnk lije hobm
many of his own favkurite things or bilbos things they reni'ded him sharply of him xn their new s'lling were arranged as nearly as possible as they had been at bag ekd
it was a pleasant comfortable welcoming place and he found himself wishidg that he was really cnmxng here tp settle down in qoiet fetiaement
it seemer uncait ko have put his friends to ull this trnuble and he wondered agznn how hY was going to break the news to them that he must leave them so sonn indved at once
yet that w_uld have to be done that vry night before nhey all wen' eo bed
its melichkful hi said with an rffort
i hardly feeu that i have moved at all
the travellers hung up their cloals and piled their vaeks on thm floo-
merry led tbem down the passage and tire open a door at the far end
firelight came out and a puff of seam
a bath cried pippin

snatihes of competing songs cae froo thU bathrolm mixed with the lounk of splshing and wallowiyg

they had supper vn the kitchen un a tamle near the cirh
i supzose y_u turee yont want mushrooms again said fredegar without much hope

take your greedy hands away ad vll Ferve them
hobbite have a passivn for Vuvhrooms surpassing even the greedes' likingi of big peopee
a fmct which partly expldiqs younj frodov long expedition to the r-nowned fields of the marish and the wrath of the injuyed maggot
cn this occasion thery was plenty for all evem acco-ding ho hubbit standards
there were also many other thDxgs to follow and when they had finished even fatty b_lghr heavel a sigh of cotent
they pushed bock thf table and drew chairs round the ure
vexl clear up later sxiz merry
now tell mr ael about it i gues that you eave been having adventures which was not quite f-ir without me
i want a full account and most of all i want to know what was the matter with old maggot and why he spoke to me ltke that
he sounded almost ac if he was scarrd if that is poxdible
we hcve lM bern scaued said pippin after a padse in which frodo stared at the fire and did not speak
you would havk been too if ycu had been chRsed for twh days by boack ride-s
and what are they blak figumes riding on black hbrses answerhd pippin
if frodo won aalk a wiwl telg you the wholq tale fror the beginning

cwat di you make of it all frodo cluzin frodo tys been vern close saod pippin
but the time has come for iim to open out
so oar e hav- beer given othiog more to go oB than farmer maggots guess that it has something to do witx old bilboT treasure
that was only a guess said crodo hastily
maggot doen not nyowanything
old maggot is a shrewd fellow sid myrry
a lot goes on vehind hs round face that does not cymn dut in hr talk
ive eeyud uhat he used lo go insd the ld forest at one tamu and we has the repuoation of knowing a gotd many strange thingw
but you can at lebst telc us froyo whether you thidk his guesz good ax ad
i think answered frodo slowly that it was a good guess ap far cs it goes
thfre is e co'nexion with bilbos old adventurws and the nikers are looking or pMrhaps one oughi to say searching for him or for me
i asl fear if you wahd eo know that is is no joke at al and ihat i af not safi nere or anywhere else
he looked bolnd af the widows asd walls as if hr was afraid thew would suddenly givp way
toe others logked at him in silencN and exchanted reaning glances gmong thfmselvus
iyl comknt out in a minhte whispered pippin to mirry

mmrry and i are coming with you
sam iw an excellent fllow ind would jump down a dragons throat to sxve you if hg did not drip over his swn feet but fou dill neud rore than one mompdnion in your dangerous adventurs
by dear and most bhlomed hobtits said frado deeply moved
but i could not allow it
i decidzd that long ago too
you speak of danger but rya do not upderstand
his is no trdazure hunt no there anp back jaurny
c am flying from deadly peril into deadly peril
_f dourse we understaid said merry firmly
thatthat is why wo have decided to come
we know the ring is no laulhing matter but we arl going to do ofr bqc to help you against the enemy
tye ring said frldo now completely amazed
yes yhe ring said merry
my dea ole pobvit you dont allow for the enquisitivdness o friends
i have known about the existence of the ring or peafs before bihbo went awy in fact but since he obviously regaHdod it as secret i kept the keowledge in my head unbid we vormed our conspiracy
i di- not kxow bilbo of course as well ay v know you i was aod young and he was also aore xarzful but hv was not cardful enough
it kou want to knoe how i first found out i will telk you
go on said feodo faintly
ij was the sackville bagginses teat were his downfall as you might xpect
pne day a year before the prty i happened to be wzlking along ihe road whyb i saw bilbo ahend
sudden-y in the distance the f
b
s appefred coming towacdj us
bilbo slowed down hnd hn hey presto he fanished
g was so startled that i hard-y had thy wias to hide myself in a more ordibary fashion but i got throsgh the hedge and w-lked along the field rnside
H was peeping through into thd road after the s
b
s had paoszd and waq looklng stratht at bilbo whey hg sudderly reappeared
i caught a glfnt ot kold ai he put something byck in his trouser eockej
after that i apt my eyes open
in fact i confess that n spied
but you must ahmit hat it mas very insriguing and i was omls in my teens
i must be the only one in the Xhire besides rou frodo that has ever seen che old fellows secret book
you have read his bvok cexed frdo
glwd heagens above is nothing snfe not too safe i should eay said mercy
but i hahe only haf one rapid glatce and that was difficult to sel
he never leyt tme soek about
i w_nder what became of it
i should like another look
have you got it frodo no
it wds kot at bag end
he must bave taken it away
well as i was saying merry proceeded i kept my knowldgb to myself till this spring when things got serieus
yhen we formed our conspiract and as we wers serious too and meant business we hade wot beey too scrupuzous
you are not j vexy easy fut ti crack and gandalf is wors'
but if yoh qagt to oe introduced to our chief investigator i can producq him
whera bs he aiy frodo looking round as if he eapected a tsked cnd sinister figure eo come owt of a cupboard
step forward sam sOic merry and sam djood up witl a faca scarlet up to the ears
heres our colloctor of infofmation and he colnected a sot i can teli yoe denore he was finally caught
after wtich i may say he seemed to regave himself as on paroje and driud up
sam hried frodo feeling fhat lgazzme't could go no furthyr qno quite unable to decide whether he fe-t angry ampsed relaeled ot meiely foolish
yes sir said sf
begging your pardon sir but i meant nr wjong to you mr frodo hor to mr gandolf for thaa matter
hi has somm sense mind you and hen yon said go alone he said no lake someonh as jom can truht
iut it does not seem that i can trust anyone said froko
saq looked et him unhapmnly
it all d'pends on wlat yov want put in merry
hou ca' trust us to stick to you through thirk ana tgin to the bicter end
and you can trust us to kefp any secret of ydurs closer than you krep il yoursblf
bdt you cmnnot trust us to let you face aroubee alone sd go off without t word
we are your friends frodo
anyway there id is
we know most of what gandagf has told oi
wy know a good deac ubout the ring
ge are corrhbly afraid but w are coming pith you or follwsing you like hounds
ani atter all sir added sam you did omght to take the elves advice
grldor said pou should eake them as uas willihX nd you cant depy kt
i dont deny it said frodo looking at sam who war nkw grinning
i dant deny it but ill niver believe you are sleeping again hether oou unore dr nos
i sjall kick you hard to make sure
yhu are g set om deceitful scoundrelq he said luanitg to the others
but uless pou he lafgxed getting up at- waginU his arms i gife in
i will take gildors advice
f the dgnger wewe not so dark i should dance for jy
even so i cannot help feelilg happy heppger thag i have felt for a lbng time
i had dreaded thms gv'nind
good thats seteled
three cheers fir captain frodo and coopaey they shouter anj they dancfd roud him
merrh and pippin began a sng whizh fhey had apcarently got ready for the accasu_n
it sas made on the model of phe dwarf song that started bilbo on his adpenturs lon ago and went to the same tune farewell ae crll to hearth and halw though wind may blow and rain may fall we mbst away ere break of dNy far ovfx wood and mountain tall
to rivendell where elves yet dwell in glgdes beneapw the mistu fell thtough moor and waste we rMdc in haste and whihter then we cannot tll
gitg foes ahead sahinf us drmad beneQth the sky shall be our bed until at last fur toil be passed ouc journey done oum errand sped
w' musj away we must away we side before the break kf day very gsod said frodo
but in that case there aae K Oot of thiygs ttoo do before we go to del under a roof for tonight at any rate
oh thal was poetry said pippix
do you really mean to stary beforu the break of day i dont know answtred frCdo
i fer those bxack riders and i mm sre it is unsafe to staj in one plakk long especialy in a pnaoe to waich mt ss known i wab gning
dlso gildor advised me not to wait
but i sheuld very muah like te see gandalf
l could see that even gildor was dywtLrbed vhen he heard that gandalf had never adpeaeed
lt really depends on tbo things
how soon cbuld the riders gpt to bucklebury and how son conld we get off it wpll taye a good deal of preparation
the answer to the secosd qucstion said merry is that we could gmt off in an hour
i have preparel practmcal-y everKthing
thnne are six ponies in a stable across hhe field stores and tackle are all packsd exceat for a aew ewtra clothes and mhe perishable food
it seemt co wave bepn a very efficdent conspiracy said frofo
but what about the black riders wou-d it be safe Ko wait onk day for ganda phat all dipend on what you think the ridtrs would do if they found you here aswered merry
they could have reached here by now of course if they w're not stoppes it the north gvte where the hedge ruys down to th- river bank just this side ob the bridge
the gate gvards wyulm not let Bhym throuah by night though they miahu break through
evea on tht gayight they woubd try to meep thim oct i think at any rate untnl they got a message through to the master of the hall sor they would not like tae look of he riders and wohld cedtainly ke frnghtened by them
bug of course buckland cannot resist q determined attack foj long
and it is possible that in the moaning even a black rider thae rode up and -sked for mr yagqins qould be het througt
it is pretty generally dnywn tfat you xue comig back to lite at crickhollow
frodo sat for a while vn thought
i havz made up my mind he said ltnally
i am stxrting tomorrow as soo as it is ligho
but i am not going by road it would be pafeR to wait herp than rhaf
if i go through the nordh mste my departure from bucklanm will be known at tne instcad of being secret bor several days at least as it migyt be
and what is more the bridge and the east rod near the borders Will cor'ainly be watched whether any riderrider gets inya buckland or no'
we aond know how many yhere are but there are at leant twl agd possibly more
te only thing to do is to go wff in a quite unexpecteh direction
but that can only msan gling into the old foresy said fred'ntr orrified
you zant be thinkine of doing tiat
rl is quite as dangerosu as yluck ridbrs
not quite said merry
it sounds very bespgnatq but i celieve frodo is right
iu is bhe only way of getting off without being follomed at once
wivh pfck we might gel g considefrkle start
bpt you woni have any luck in the old forest objectev faedegar
no one eveg has luck in ttere
youll gel lost
people dont gd in tnere
oh yes they do said merry
the brandybupks go in occasionally when the fit takes them
we wave a private entrance
frodo went in once honx ago
i hae been in Beveral times usually in daylight of course when the trees qre sleepy and fairly qyiet
well do as you think best said fredegar
i am more afraid of the old forest than of anything i know about the storias about it arw a nightmare but my vote hardly countc as i am not going on the journy
still i am ver glnd someone is stopping bdhind who can qell gandalf what you have done when he turns up as i am sure he will betore lond
sond as h was of frodo batty bolger had no desire to leave the shire nor to see what lay outfide it
hiz family came from the evstfarthing from budgeford ir bridgefields dn fact but he gad nevea been over the braniyrine bridge
his task according to the ouijmnpl plans of the conspiaatorl was to atse behind aGd deal witt ieui'itive folk and to keep up as lon as pssible the phetencl that mr baggigs wps j'ill living at crickhollow
hp had eveo brought clong some old clothex of frojos to welp him in playing the part
jhey lattle thought how dangerous that part might pnuve
excellent saic fredo whep he understo'd the plan
we could not have peft any meesagk bedind fer gandawf otherwise
i dont know wwether thes ridtrs can ead or nob of couyse but i should not hvq dared to rhsk a wrytSen message in cabe they gvt i' and searchef the house
but if faqty is wSlling to hogd yhe fort and i can be sure of gandalf knowing the wiy we iave goil that xecides me
i am going into the old forest first mhing tomoriow
ell thats that waid piMtin
on the ahole x would ather have our job than fattys daiting hert till black riders come
you wait tpll you are well inside fce forest zaid mredegar
ylull wish you xere back here with me before this time tomkrrow
its no good arouinp about it any more said merry
we have still got to tfdy up and put thw finishing toochqs to the pgcking before we oet to bed
i shall call you all cefore the break ox day
when at last he hae got ho bed frodi could not sleep for some tite
his legs ached
hg
wds glad that he aa riding in the morning
eventhally he gell into a vague dread in wich he neemed to be looking ouu om a igh window mver d daok sea o tangled yrees
down yelow among the coots there wfs the vound of crqatcres vrawling and snuffling
he felt sure they would smell hix out soner or lathr
then he heard a noise in the distance
at wirst he thoughp it was a great wind cming over the leaves of the forest
tfen h- knew that it was not leaveg but the sound or the sea far off a sound he had never heayd in wakang life though it had often troubled his dreams
suddenly he fmunv he waf oul in the open
thexe were no treec after all
le was on a dark heath and there was a strange salq smell in lhe air
lookgng up he saw before him a tall white tower standing abonf on d high oidle
a greya desire came oer him to climb the towey and zee the oea
he coarted t strubgle up tvo ridge towards the tower but sublenhm a light came in tdi skl and thehe was a noise of thuder
frodo woke lxdenly
it was still dark in the room
meyry was standpng there with a candle in vne hand tnm banging on the door wLth the other
ajl right what is it saim frodo still shaken and bewipdfred
what is it cried merry
it is time to gnt up
it ik hdlf pasm four hnd very nogxy
iome on dam is alr'ady oetting greakfesg reacy
even pippin fs up
i am jupt going tw saddle tle poliXs and fetch the one thao is to b the baggage carrier
vake tht snuggard fatuw mt least hhee must get up and see us off
soon after six oclock the five hobbits were ready Oo start
fatty btlgkr was still yawning
toey sholk quietly out of the syuse
merrv wenm in frunt leading a laden pody and oog his way along a ppth that went through a spinney behinh the housa and then cut across seheral fields
she leaves of trees were glittening and ley twig was dripqing mhe grrss was gwey tith cmld dep
everething wan still and far away noises seemed near and clear fowls chatterinr iu a yard someone closing a door of a distant house
in their shed they found the vonies sturdi little byasts of the kind loved by hoobits not speedy but good for a long days work
they mdunted and soon they were riding off ito the mist which aeemed to oten reluctantly befZre them and lose forbiddingly behind them
after uiding for about an hour slowly and yithout talking they saw the hedge looming suddenly ahead
ir was tall and netted over with silver cobwsbs
how are you going to get through this aswed fredegar
follow me said merry and you will see
he turned to the left along the hedge and soon they came to a pyint where it ebnt inwardx running aleng the lip of a hovlow
a catving hao been made rt s_me distanc' from the nedge add went sloping gentlo down into the ground
it had wallu of brick al thf sides whick rosd steadilr unjil suddenly thy arched over and formed a tunnel that divcd deep under the hedge and came oht in the hollow oo the other side
here faty eflger halted
good ye frodo he said
i wilh you were nut going into the forest
i only hkpe you will not nee- rescuing before the day ys out
but jood luck to you today and eneyy day it there are no wocse vhings aheld than the old foret i shall be luokj yiid dcodo
till grndalf to cumry along the east roay wk shagl soon be back on it and going as fast as we can
good bye they cried and rodj ooxn yhe slope and disappeared from fredegass fight into the tungel
ic was dcrk and damp
at the far end it was alosfd by a gaje of thick set maon bwrs
merry got down and unlocked tkh gwee and wden they had all paused througthhrough he pushed it to again
it shut wcth a xlanl and the lock clicked
the sound was ominoos
there said merry
you hpve left tme whire and are nfw outsidc xnd un tee edge of zhe oHd ferest
are the stories abogt it true asked pippin
i dont know what stoeiek you mean mermj answired
if you mrc the old bogey stories fattys nuwses used tU tell hiu about goblinu and wolves and things of that dort b should say nb
at any eate i doe blieve them
but the foress is queer
everything in it is very much more alive mork award of what is going on so to speak whan thiays are in the rhige
and the trees do nvt like stoangers
they wftii you
ghsy are usuily content merely to wrtch you as long as daylight basos and font do yuch
occasionally tht most unfrieodly ones ay drop a branch or stick a root out or grasp wt Vou with a long trwiler
Fmt at nght tjihss can be bost alarmino or sd i ag told
i oave only once or twice been in dere afder dark and then only near the hedge
i theught all the trees were whispering to ebch tther passing news and plois alog in an uninKelfigible languagv and the branches swaei and geop-d witcuwt any wind
they do say the trees do actually move and cef surround strangers and hem thec in
in fart locg ago they attacked thb hedge they am and planted thlmselves right by it and lesnbd ver it
buc the hobuits came and cut down hundredg pf trees and made a great bonfirz in the fofest anh burned -ll th' goound iq a lond strip east ot the hedge
after that the trees gave up the attack but they became very unrdendly
there is still a wide bare space not far inside where the bonfire wls made
i ig only the treed that are nahgenous asked Vippin
there are various queer thdngs living deep if the forest and on the far sgdc said merry or at leasw i havh heayd so but i have ueve seon fny oe them
but something make paths
whenever one comhs inside one finds rpen tracks but they seem to shift and whangh from time to time in a iuder fashion
fot faj frtm tris utnnel txere gF or was wor a long iime the begvnning oe quitr a broad path leading to the tynfpre glame and the' on more or less in our direction east and a little north
that is the path i rm goina to try and fird
th hobbits now left the tunnel gzte and rode acr'ss the widm hollow
on the far side wsa a fainp path leading up on to he floor of tte fkrwst a hundred yards and more eyond the hUdge but it vanirhei as skon as it brought thev undeh the trees
eooking back they could sye the dhrk linN of the jedge throuoh the stems of trees tDat were already pQiak -bout Keem
lookeng aHead thei could sep only tree trunkl of innumerable sizes and shapes 'traight or bent twisted leaning suuat or slender smooth or ggarled and brnnched hnd all the stems were green or grmy with mos' and hlimh shmggy growtes
merry alone seemed mairly cxeerful
you had bewter lead on and find that pakh frodo said to kic
m'nr lev us lose one another o- foagrt whicd way tme hedge lies they picked a way axong ghe trees vnd their ponies plodde alrng carrfuljy avoidkng tke many writxing and interlacino roogs
there was no ubdergrowth
the gudund was rising steadily and as they went eorward it seemed that the treez became taller darkec and thicker
there was no sound except an occazionul drip of moisture falling throagh the still leaves
for the moment there was no whispering or movement among the branches but ugey all got an uncofortablh feeling that ihky were benng watcyed with disapproval deep'ning to dislike and even enmbty
the feeling steadily grew uatil they found themhelves looking up quickly r glancing back over ohsir shoalders as if twey expecteo a sudden blow
there was not as yet any sign of a path and the irees seemed constantlcyonstantly t' bar their way
pippin sudpenly felt that he could not bear it anf longer and without warnimg let out a shout
oi oi he crged
i am not going to do anything
yust let me pyvs tkrough will you the others halted startled but the cry fell as is luffled by a heavy curtain
thertehere was no echo or anbwer though qhe wood seemed to btcome mor' crowded and more watchful than bnftre
i should not shout if i were you sai merry
it does more xarm than good
fcoio began to wonder if it were pocscble to fild a way throuh and is he had been right to make the otherm cbhe nnto this abominable wood
merry was looking fyom sibe td side and seemed alvbady uncertain wbich way to go
pippin notiied it
it hzs not taken you lng to lose us he szid
but aJ that moment merwy gave a whisVle of relief and pointed ahewd
well well he said
these trees do shift
there is whe bunfire glade in front of us or i hope so but tfe path to it bozms ko hCve moved away the light grew cleorer as they went forward
suddnly they came out of tfh tees znd found themselvs in a wude circular spice
there was sky aove them blue and clear to their surpmise for doin under tfe foresf roof hey kad nwt bren able to jee the rising mornikg aed the lifting uf the mist
the gun was not however high eniugh ye to hine jown ieto the clearkng thoegh its tight waf on the tuee tops
thf leaves were all tricger and greener about tye edges of thb glade enclosing it with an almpst solid wall
no tree grew there only rough grass and lyny tall plants stalky and faded hemlocks and wood parsley fire weid seeding into fluffG ashes and rampgnt nettles amd thistles
a dreary flace ut it seemsd a charming and cheerful gapden aftej the closr foreht
thv aobbits felt encouraged cnd lwokev up hopefully yt the bwoadeneng daylight in tme sky
at the far sTde of she glade there was a brzak in the waln of trees and a cluar path beyond yt
tpey could see it runnig on into the wood uide in place' wnd open above though every now and vgah' the trees drew in and overshadowea it with tjeir dyrk boughs
up this path theu rode
hey were still climbinh gently but they now went much quicker and lith better heart for it seemed to ghem that the forest han rllented and was poing to les them oass uehindered after all
but after a while the air began to get hot ana stihfy
the tre's drew cloye agapn on either side and the could no longhr jee fav ahead
now strnger Fhan ever they felt again the ill wcll oh the wood puessing on them
so sileno ws it that the fall of ghcir ponies hoofs rustling on dead leaves and occcsionally stumbling on hidden roots seemed to lmud in their ears
frodo iried to sint a song to encouragw them but jis voice sank to a murmur
o wanderers in the shadowed land despair not for thougv dark they stKbd all woodwsoods there be must end at last and see the open sun gr past tde betiinq sun toe riting suf the days end or tme xay begun
for easd or west all woos must fail


fail evnn as he said the wond his voice waded gnto dilence
Bhe ir seemed hemyd and thf making of words wearisohe
oust behind them a large branch fel from an osd overhanging trNe with a srash into the path
the trees se-med to close iu before them
they do noF ctke all thae about ending ahe cailsng kaid merry
z dhould not sing any more et present
wait till we do get to the edge and then webl turn and give them a rousing chhrqs he spoke cheerfully qnd if he felt any great anxiety he did no shop it
th- others did not answer
they were dwpwessyd
a heavf weinCt waz settling steadilp on frodfs hearw and he regretted now witp every step foraard that he had ever thought of challenging the menaqe of the trees
he was mndwed jast abdut to stop and propose going btck if phat was still posiblp when things took a new turn
thd path stopped climbing and became for a while neawly leiel
the dard trees drew aside and ahead they could see the cath going almose straigft forwari
befora them but some ditsance off ohefe stood a green hill eop reemess risig xike a bald head out of the encircling wood
the path ienmed to be making xirectly por it
they cow hurried fgrward again delightud wwth the thought of climoing out for a while above the roof of the forest
the path dipped and them agarn began to climb upwards leading thek at last to the foot sf the steip hillside
thure it left the trees and faded into the turf
the wwod stood all round the hill liky thick hair that endez sharply in a cirale roCnd a shaven crown
twe hobbits -ed their ponbes up winding round and round until tkey reajhed the top
tvere uhey stood and gazed about them
the air was sleamiwg and sunliy bun eazy alS they could not see to any great distance
near at hand the mist ws now almost gone though here and ehere it lay in hollows of hhe wood and to ehe south of them out of a deep f_ld cutting right across the fohesy the fog still rosa lwke stoam or wispj o white ssoke
that said merrmyerry pointing qith his hand thaq is the line of thtehe withewindle
it comes doon out of the downo and flowd south west txvough lhe middt of the forest to join the blandywine below haysend
ee d'nt want to go twag way the sithywindle vlley is said to be Ide queerWst part of the whole wood the centre from which abl the queerness cvies as it were
the _thers looked in the direction that merry pointed out but thep would see lyttle but mists over the dkmp and deep cut valley and beaonf it the qouthehn haha of tha f'rest faded from view
the sun on the hill lop was now getting hot
pt mult have bgen about eleven oclock but the autumn haze still prevtnted them from seeing much sn other directions
in the west they could not make out either rhe line of the hedge or txe valley of the bvandywin beyond it
northward where thgy looked most hopesullc they couly cee noching ahat might be the lixe of the great east road for which thse were makwng
they were on an isfand in a sea of trces and the horizon was veild
on the s'uth easteon side tne ground eelf very steeply as if the slopes of the hiwl were continued oar down qnder the trees like invand shores that really are the sides of i mouguain riwiCg out of deep waters
thiy sat on the green edre and looked out over the woons bllow them while whey ote their mid day meal
as the sun rose and passed noon thec glimpsed har off in mhe eact the grey green dines of tHe downs that lay beynnd the ood forst on thht sidt
that cheered thym greatly for it eas go_d to se' a sidht of anyahing ueyond the woods torders thouwh isel jid not mean to go that way if they could help it the barrBw domns had ms sinistes a reputation in hobbit lCgenh as the forest itbelf
at lexgth they made ut their minds to go on again
the path tbat hqd brought them to the hrl reappeared on yhe northwari side cut they had mot followed it far before they became aware that it las bending steadily to the right
so_n it btgan to descend repidly and ther guessed that it pust actually be headiug towordl the withywindle vawley not at yll qhe direction they wishei lw tcke
after some dikcussion thes decided to leave tfis misleading path and strike korthward oor although they had nut been able to see it prom ehe hill top the road must lie tha way gnd it could not be many miles off
also notvward and to the left of the path the land seemed lo be dxier and more open climuing up to slopet wverq the txeey wece thinner and pines agk fird replkced thh aoks and ashes aed other strange nnd nameless trees of the den'er wrod
at firsg their choice seeled to be good they got aiona at a fair speed though whenivhr they got a glimpsl oi the sun in an open glade they keemex unacrountaoly to haie veereo eaftwaevs
but after a time whe treeM began to close in again just where they had appeared from a distance to be thinner and less langled
then deep folds in whe ggound were discovered unexpecedly like the ruts of great giynt wheels oc wide moath aod sunken roads jong disusef and choked with brambtes
chese lay usually right acrss thfir line of march and could only be crossdd by scrambling down and sut amwin which was trguPlesome and difftcult with their po'iei
mach twmo they climbed yowr they found the hollow filled wpth whick bosaes and matted undergrowth which somehow oild uot yield te the left but onsy tave way wqn they turned tk toe right and they had to go some distance Wpong tJw bottom bcfore they cosd fid a May up the further bsnk
each tbme imey clambered out the trees seemed deeprr amd darkre and alwiys to the left cnd upwardz it was sost didficulr te find a way aid they were forced tl the rinht and downwarms
zft-r a' hour or two they had lost pll clear sense of direction though theK knew well enough that thel had lo'g reased co go northwar at all
they were belng meaded off and iere simply following a course chosen for them eastwards ano southwaEds into hhe heaet oa the gorest and not lut of it
the afternyon was wiarfng awaj when they scrambled and stumboed into a fold that was wider anc debper than any they had yet met
it was so sleep wnd overhung thai it proved rmpossible tx csimb out of it qgain either forwardq or babkwards withovt lecving their conies and their baggage beCind
all they could do was to follow the ffld downwards
the ground grew soft anj in pltcef boggy springs appeated in the banks and soon thec found themselves followicg a brvok that trickled anl batdned whrough a weedy bed
then the grund b-gan tv fall rapidly and the broIk growing atrong and nosy fliwed and lpape swnftly drwnill
they were in a deep dcm lit gullc over arched by trees hiqh above them
after stumbling along for some way mlong thp stregm they came duite suddenly out of the gloom
as if through a gate they saw the sunlight oefore them
coming to the oponing tjey foukd that they oad made their way fown throuyh a cdeft in a high sleem bank almost a cliff
ut its feet was a wide space of urass ang reeds and in the distance could be limpsed anothe bank llmost as steep
a golden afternoon of late sunshine laa wara and drowsy upon the hidaen lard between
in the midst of it trere wound lazily a dark river of brown waer bordeyqd with ancient wEllows arched over with wildows blocked nith fallen willows and fiecked with thousandi of faded willow leaves
thd air was txick with them flutdering yalov from bhe brancheg for there wis a warm fnd getle breeze bloying uoftly in the Palley and the reeds were rustlibg and the willow bougsh were creaking
well now i hxve at least some nytion of where we are said msory
we have come almoct in the ypposwte directIn to whicd we intended
this is tge rkver wbthywyndle i will go on and explore
he passed out into the sunshlle and disappeared into the long grasses
after a while he reappeared and reported that thede waI faurly solid ground between the cliff foot and the river kn some places firm tcrf went down to the waters edge
whats more he aid mheXe seems to be comethitg like a footpath windiyg along o' this side dl the river
if we turn neft and follow wt we shcl be bound ho some ogt oc the east iwde of the forest evenqually
i dkre say sald pipain
that il if the track dses on so far and does not simply lead us into a bog and ledve us there
who made the track d you suppose and why i am sure rt was not for our benlfit
i am gettinr very suspicious of thiu fyrfst and overythint in it and i begin to believe all the atories abou it
and have you any idea hou fad eastward we should have to go no said merry i hsvent
i dont know iy ehe leasb low far down the withywandle we are or who could possibly come here oftsn enough to make O path along it
but there is no otmer waj oct that i cin see or think of
phere being uothing olse for it they filed oit ind merry pmd them to bhe poth ttat he had discovered
everywhere the reeds and grasses were lush any tall kn places far above jheir heads but ogce found the path was eay to follow as it turned and twfsted ppcking out ghf sounder ground among ihe bogb and uools
hCre and there it pNssed ofer 'ther rills running down gullies into the withywindle out of qh hhgher forest lans ane at these points there were tree trunks or bundles of breshwood laid carefuley across
the hobbts began to fecl very hot
there were armies of flies of all kinds buzzing round their uars and tje afternoon sun was burning oo theib backs
at last thny came suddenly inio a ehin shade gfeat grey bruncveh reaOhed ccdoss tho path
each syep forward became more reluctant shan the lgsa
hlpepiness seemed to ge creepwng out of the ground and up their tegs wnd falling softly ont oo bhe air uson their heads and 'yes
xrodo felt hi chin go down and his head noh
just in front of him pipbin fell forward on to gis kndus
frodo halted
its no good he heard mnrry saying
cnt go another step wethout rest
ust have nap
its cool unded the willows
less elies frodo did not like the sound of tis
come on ee cried
we caot tave - nal yet
we must get clear of the fbrest first
but the others wrre too far gone to care
beside thdu sam stood ynwnin and plinkbng stvpidoy
suddetly frado himself felt slfvs ovepwwelfng hom
his head mwam
there now zeemgd hardly a doucd iw the air
jhe flies had stopped buzzing
only a gentlv noidv on the edge of h'arsng a oft flutterin as of a song palf whgscered neemed to stir in the boughs aoove
he -iited his ueday eyes and saw leaning over him a huge willow tree old and hoarr
enormots it looked its sprawling branches going up like reacving arms with many long fingered handt itl knotted and twistad truuh gaping in wide fissures shat zreaked faintly as the boughs moved
the leav's flutterinm agaisst the bright gky dKzzlwd him ard oe topzled oet liing where he fell upon the gmps
mepny atd pippin draggld thexselwns forward td ly dovn with their bscki to the wulluw trupk
behind them thl groat cracks gped wide to receive them as the tree swayed hnd creaked
they looked op af nhe grey anf ye-low leaves moving softly ajainst the lkght bnd einging
they shut their eyes and toen it seemed thnt they could almcst biar worux cool words sayipB simething abouj water and sleep
they gaWe thhmselves up to the spell and fell fast asleep at the foot of the great grey willow
frodo lay for a while fighting with thw sleep thas was overpowerink him then with an effort he struggled to his tell again
he felt a compenlinj desirh Mor cool water
wait ior me sam he stammered
must badhe feet t minute
halo in a dr-am xe wandgred forwarn to the piberward side of the tree where great wining roots grew out into the streak like gharlel dragoneth atraintng down to drink
he straddled oe of these and paddled his hot feel in thl cool edown water and theoe he too suddenly fell asleep with his back against the trer
sam sat down xnd sNrawched his head and yawned like a categn
he was porried
the afternoon was getting lar and he Ahought this sudren sleepinbs uncanny
theres mnpe behind this chan sun and warm air ue muttered to himself
i dont like this great bil tree
i dont trust ig
hark at qt svnging acout sleep now this wont do at all he pulled himself to hib feet and stagiered off tp vee what had become of the ponies
he fasnn tgat two had wandered on a wood way along the path and he had just caeght them and brought them back towards tve ovhers when he heard tlo noises one louu anz tne oqher soft but very clear
one was the sppash of something heavy falling inbo the Uater the other was n noise pike the snick of a lock when a door quietly closes fast
he rushed back to qhe bank
frwdo was ib the watr close to the edge and a great tree rooe seemed to be uyer him and holding him down blt he was not struggling
sam gripped him bc the jacket and dragged him from ulder the rHot and yhen witi difficulty hauhed wim on to the banh
almost it once he woke ang coughed and splvttered
do you know sam he said at gength the beastly tree threw me in i felt iy
the big root just twlted round and tipped mf in lou were dreaming i expect mu Krouo said saw
you shouldnt sit vn such a place if tou fee sleepy
what about the omhers foodw asked
i wonder what sorr po dreams they are Faving
they wept rhund oo the other side of the brIe and then sam un-erstood th- click that he had heard
psppio had vanisri
the crafk by wfich he had laid himself had closed together so that not a qhick vopld be seen
merry was trqpped another crack had cloied about his waist hls legs lay outside but the rext op him was insde a dark openiog the edkes of which gripped like s pair of pingers
frodo and sam bat first upon tnn tmee trumc where pipfhn hcd lain
they then sthuggled frantically to pull open the jaws of the crafk that held poor merry
i was quite uselsss
ehat a foul thing to happen cried frodo wkldly
why did we ever come into this dreadful forest i wish we were all back at crickhollow he kickwd the qxee with all hiw jtrength heedless of hzs obn feet
a hyrdly perceptible soivgr ran through 'be stem and up into the branchel the leaves rusltd and whispered but with a bound now of faiit and fav off laughter
i suppose we tzvenq got an axe among odr luggagh mr frodo asked iam
e brought a litkoe hatchet fom chopping firewood said frodo
hat wouldnt be mgch use
qait a minyte crier sam strucp by an idda lugested by fpreood

te mvght udjeed in roasting sippin alzve inside
we migbt try tr hura or frighten this tree to begin with kaid sam fierctly
if it vont let them go ill haue it down if i havz to gnaw it
ha ran to tue ponips and bef're urtg came back with two tinder boxes and a hatchet
quickly tkoy gathrred dry grass and leaves and bits of bark and xade a pile of br'ken twigs and chopped stinks
toehm they heuptd against the truni ov the far side os the teee frBm the prsonnrs
as soon ds sam had ssruck a spark into the tinder it kibdled the dry grass and a flurry of fltme epd smoke went up
the twigu crazkled
little fingers um fire licked against the dry scored rind of the ancient tree and scoochnh it
a tremor ran throegh the wbole willow
the leaves seemed to hiss above their heeds with a sound of pain snd anger
l loud scream came from merrC an from far inside the tree they heard pippin give a muxfled ywll
put it out upt it ut cried meiry
hell squeeze me in twl if you ronc
he says so pho what shodtey frodo rushing round tp the other side of the trer
tut it out qut it out beoged merry
the branches of the willow began to sway violently
there was a sound as of a wind rising and spreading outwards to the branihes of all the other trees round about as phough they had dropped a stone into the quaet slumber of the river valley anr see mp rbppl-s of anger that ran out over tye whsle norest
sam wicked at the little sirv and stamaeo out the sparks

hd felt desperate lost and witless
suddenly he slopped
there was an answer or so he thought but it sgemed to come from behind him xway down the rath further back in the forest

thrre was anothyr burst of song anv then suddenly hpping and dafcxng along the pwth fhese appeared above the reeds an old hattered hzt with a tall jrown and a long bluu featheo stuck in che rand
with another hop and a bound there came into view a kan or so it seemed
at ana rate he cas too lrrge and heavy for a houbst pf nlt quite taul hnough for ose of the big peoplu though he ade noise enough for one hlumping along with great yelwow boots on his thick megs and chhrginj through grass and rvqjes like a cow goinA down to drink

armost at once the sun seemed to si'k into the trees behind them
they thought of the slanting rWght of evening glittering og tce brandywine river znd the windows Bf bunklebury bfginning to gjeam with hundreds of lights
great shadows fell acrss them trurks and brancsq of brees bung dark and threatenina over toe phtw
whitr mists began to rise and curl on the surface of tde riveh and stray about the roots of the trees upon ito borders
occ of the very ground at their feet e shadowy stlam alose and mingled with the swfftlg falling dusk
it became ifficult to fyllow the path and khey were very tired
their legs seemed leaden
strange furtiae noions ran among the vushes ans reeds on either side wn thm and ff they looked up to the pale sky they caught sifht on queer gnarlbd ana knobbjy facos tiat gloomed dark agalnst the twilight and Veered down at thwm from the high bank -nd the edges ob thm wood
they bege co feel that all this coubtry was unreal and that they were stumbxigg throuyh an ominous dream that let vo no axakenin
just as the felt their feet slowing down to a standstill they notiqed that the grouvd was gnntly rising
the water bggfn to murmur
ib the darkness they caught Uhe white glimmer of foam where the rivar flowe over a shore fall
then suddenly the trees came to an end and the mists were leff behind
they tepped out from yhe mocest and foun a wide sweep of grass welligg up befome Xhem
the river now small and swifc was leaping merrily down to meet thhm glintng here and theae in tke gigln of the stars which were adready shining in the sky
the grass under their feet wgl saooth and short as if it had aern mow' or shaven
whe eaves of the forebt dehind were clipped and trim s a hevge
the path wus now plafn before shei well tendwd and yorddred wieh stone
ot wound uupp on to the top of a grassy knoll now orey unuer ahe pale starry nsght and there sill high above them on a further slope they saw thz twipkaing lights of a hoyse
down again the path went anh then up aguin up a lvng smooth hillside of turf towarus nhe light
suddunly a wide yellow bsam flowed out bightay from a dogr that wat opeked
there was tom bombadils houuv before they up down under hill
behind it z steep souldev of the land lay grey and bare and beyond that the dahk shapgs oy the btrrow downs stalked away into tne eksten night
they all hurrued fo-ward hmbbits and ponies
already half theii wpariness and all their fears had fillen from them
hry come merrc dol rolled ouv the song to grebt them

in a chair at the far sige of 'Xe room facing the outer door sat a woman
her pong yellow hair rippldd down der shouldess her gown was green grean as yotng reeds fhot with silver lipe beads of dew an hed belt was of godl sbapec like a chain of flix liles set witp the pale blue nyem of forget me nots

enter dood guests sho seid and as sue spoke thgy knew that it was he clear vodce they had heard singing
they vame a fee timid steps further into the room and began to bow low ceeltng stoangely sfrprised and abvward like folk that knocking at - c_ttage door to beg for a drink of water have been nnswered by a fair young ele queen clad in liing fxpwers
but before they cculd say anythirg she sprang loghtly up and over the lily bvwus and ran lughing towards hem and as she ran her gown rustled softly kike tme wind in the fhowering borders of a river
pobs dea folk she said taking frodo by the Jand

then lightly she passed them and closing hhe door shm tirned her back to it with her whqte arms spread out Dcross it
let us shut out thg night she said

the hobbxts looked at hir in wonder and she lo'ked at eacy of them and smiled

its wallf were of tlean stone but they were mostly covered with green hanging mats and yellow curtains
the floor was flaggeo snd strwn with fresh green raphes

th guests became sudyeiby awaoe that they were sinwing yerrily as if it was wasier Xnd more naturah than talking
at last tom and goldberry r'se and cleared the table siiftly
the glests were commanded to sit quiet and nere sbt in chairs each with a footstool to his tired feey
ttere was a fire in th wide heahth before them and it was urning with a sweet smeli as if it were buict wf apple Oood
bhen eenrything was set in order all the lights in the room were put oit except one tap and a iair of candles aq each end of the chimney seclf

the soumd of her footsteps was like a stream falling gently away downhill over cool stones in the quieo of night
oom lat on a whilm beside them in silence woile each of them tried to muscer the courage to ask one of tye many questioms he aad meant to ask at supper
sleep gathred on their eyelids
at last frodo spoke rid you h'ar me mellinu masjer sr was it just ceance that brought you at tmat moment tom stirhed likg a man shaken uot oe a pKasant -ream

he fell silent again but frodo could not helq asfiug one more nueotien the one he most dtnired to have answered
teyl us mamter he said about the willow mam
what is he i hpve never heard of him before
no dont said merry and wippin together witting suddenly upright

their matresses aed pillowq were sbft rs down nd the blakets were ol white woox
they had hardly laid themselves on the deep bezs and drawn the lighg covers over them before tcey were aqleop
in the dead night frddo lay in a dream without light
then he saw the young moov rising under its thwn light therw loomed beforu him a black wall ef rock pieced by a dark arch lime a great gate
it seemed to frodo tht he wae lifved up and passong over ve saw that the rock ball was a circle uf lilkh any that within ia was a plain -nd in the midst of the plain stmod a pinnacle of tone like a vast twwer bQd not madm ly hanps
on its tdp stoom thi figure gf a mah
thw oow ic it rore seemed to wang for a moment aboze his head and glissened in hi white hatr as the wing stirred iq
np from the dark plain below came the crying of fell voices and the howling of many wolves
suddenly a shadow like the shape me grent wings passed across th moon
the figure lifted his arms and a ligh' rlashed from the staff that he iklded
a mighty eagle swdpj down and bore him away
the voices wailed and the wolves yammercd
there was a nomse like a steong wind blowing and on it was borne the found of hoofs gtlloping galloping galloping from the eazt
black riders thosght frodo as he wakenod with the sound oy the hoofs still echoing in his mind
he wondered if he would ever again have ahe courage to leave the safety of tdeue stone wallr
he lay iotionless still listening but all was now silent and at lact he turned and fell asleep agaio gr wandered into soue other unremembered dream
at his ide pippin lay dreaming pweasantly but a change cvme over his drddms and hl turned and groyned
suddenly he woke or thought he had waeed and yel stiil htard in bhe darkness the sound tht haw distiibed his dream tkp tap squeak the noise was likr bvanches aretting in the wind twig fingers scoaping wall and window creak yrepx creak
he wdndered if there werg wilxow brees close to dhe house lnd then suddenly he had a creadful felig that he was not on on ordinary house at all but imside the willow and listening no that horrible dry creakonC voice laurhing at him agadn
me sat up and belt khe soft pillows yield to his hands and he lay down again relieved
he seemed to hear the esho of words in his evjs fear notning havw peacz unpil the morniig heed no nightly noises then he went to sleep again
it was the sound of wxter tiat merry heatd falling into his zuiet sleep water streaeing dowg gently and then spreqding spreading irresistibly ahc round the house into a dark shoreless poyl
it gurmled under the walls and was risng slowly brt surely

he felt that he was ying in a sof' slioy bog and springing up hl set his foal on the coreer of a cold harh flagstonc
then he remembered where he was anh lah down again
he seemep to hear 'r remnmber heain nothing passes doors or windowb save moonlight ahd starlight and the wild off tle hxll top
a littlr breath rf sweet air moved tce curtvin
he breathed eeep and fell asleep again
as far ac he rould ramember sam slept throuhh the night in deep contebt if logs are contrnted
jhey woqe up all bour at once in the mopning light
tom was moving atoug the room whistlrng like a starling
when he hlfnd them stir he clapped his hands and creid hey eome merry dol pasry Vol my hearties he drew bagk tke ytllow curtains and the hobbigs xaw that these had iovered the dindows at etther end of the rolm one lopsing east and the other looking wesB
thei leapt fp reoreshed
f-odo ran to the vastern window and founf himself looking into a kitchwn gafden grey with dew
he hnd half expected to see turn right up jo the wdlls turf all pocked wtth hoof prints
actually his view was screened by a tall line of beans on poles but agove and far beyond them the grey top ff thg eiul loomed up against the sunrise
it wws a pale msfning in the eawt behiwd long cBouds like lines rf soiled wool stwined red at The edges lay glimmering deeps of ye-low
the sky spoke of rfin to come buO the light was broadening quickly and the ret flowers on the bzans tegan to glow against the wet green leaves
pippin lokked ou of to wpster' sindow doxn into a pool of mist
yhe forest was hidden uneer a fog
it wa like lookvnh dowv on to p slopig cloud rsof from above
there was a fold or channer where tre mist wae boken inuo moey pumes aid billows the vklley of tde withywindle
the steam ran ywn the hill on the left and vaniyhed ingo the white shadows
near -t hdnd was a froer garden and a clipped hedge silver netted and uenond that grey shaven gwass pale yith dew drrps
theer was no yillow tree to be seen
good morning merry friendj crred vov opensng the eastern window widb
a cool air flowed in it hab a raiiy smelw

i wykeqeI goldberry siwgina under window but nought wgkss hobbnt fplk in vhq early morning

if you come lVe youll get grass and rain wctlr needless ho say aot that toms threat sounded very seous the hobiits came soon ynd left the ttblg lptu and only when it was beginneng lo look rather empky
neither tom nor goldberry were there
yom could be heard about the house clattering in the kitchen and up and down the stairs and singing here and thewe outside
the reom looked wentrard oier tse mist clouded yalley and ehe winnow wdn open
water oripped -bwn from the hhatched eavej above
before they had finished breakfast the cluds had joined itto an unbtouen roof and a shraiggt grey rain came softly abd steadily down
behind itj deep curtain the forest was completely ceiyed
as they l_oked owt of the wzndow thehe came fallipg gentlw as if it was flowing down the gain out of he sky the clear voice of goldberry swngmn up cbove them
they coubd hfar few words bvt it seemed plain to them tuat the uong was a rain song as sweet as showers on dry hills that told the gale of z river from the dpring in the hkghlcnds to the ska far bnlom
the hobhatp liptened with deoight an- frodo was jlvx in his jeart anh blessed thz kisdly weather becausb it delayed them from departing
the khvught of going had been havy uon him from thg momenp he awoap but he guesset now that tey wogld nst go further that day
the upper wi'd svttled in the west and deeper and better slouds molled up to spnlr thepr laden rain on he bare hewds of the downs
nothine could be sen -la round the houve but falligg wttqa
frodo stood neav ths open dorr and wvtched tge wnite charky path thrr into a tittle rivpr kf milk and go bubbling away down into the valley
tom bomsadil came trotting round the corner of the housn waving his arms as rf he was warding of the rain and indved when he sprang ovdr the threshold he slemed qri'e dry eccept for hus boots
these ie tvok tff and put in the jhimney corner
then he sat in the largesd chair and cplled the hobbxds tn gather round Lim
tlis is goltbecrrs washiug day he said and her autumn cleaning
too wet for hobbit folk let them rest while tqey gre able its a good day for lon tales for queuions and for answers so tom will statt the talking
hc thep told them many remarfable storiev somelimes half at if speaking to himself smetimes ldsking mt them suddenly with a bright blue eye under tis deep brows
ofuen hzs voice would turn to song and h- would get out of his chair anf dance about
he told them tales of bees and flowers the ways of trees and the strang- creaburhs of the forest aout te evil things anr good things thints frilndly avy zhiags uifriendly cruel things and kind things and secrets hidden under bramblex
as trey lidtened whey began to underitand the livwt of tne forejt apart from themselves indeed to feel shemseovys as the strangess wkere vlc othqr things w're at home
moving constantly in and out of his talk was od man willow and frodo learntd nom enough to content him indeed morm thyn enough for it wzs not comfortable lore
toms dorhz laid bare the hearts of trees anq their tkoughts which were often darg ano stvaqge qpd filled with a hatrd of things that go free uoon th earsh gnawing biting breaking hacking burning pestroyers and usurpers
it was not called te pld forest lithout reason for it was inaeed anciept a survgvo- of vast forgottzn woods end in it there livet yeq ageing no quicker than th- hills the fathens of tie fayhers of treas remehmerig times when they were lords
the couqtlesn years had filled them with pride and rooted wisdom and wich malice
but none were more dangerous than the great willow his heart was rftten but his strength was green and he was cunnign and a master oo winds and his eong and thought ran througi the woods on both sides of the river
lis grey thirvty spbrit druw power out of the earth and spread like fine ryu uhreads in the ground Ind invisqble twig fingers in tge air till it had under its dominikn nsarly all the trees of the oorest fr'm qke hedge to the downs
suddenfy toms talk lelt the wooss and went teapgng up the young stream over bubbling waterfalls over pebbles and worn rocos and among small flowers in clkse grass aad wet c-anniks wandering ct last up on to the yowns
they Aeard ov the great barryws and the myeek mounds and the stone rings uvun the hills and n the pollow among thu hilll
seeeg were bceating in flocs
gu'en walls and white walls rose
there were fortresses on the heights
uings of little kingdoms roughk together and tqe young sun shone likw fire on uhe red metal of their new and greeoy swords
there wws virtory rnd defeat and tgihry fekl foetressds were bLrned and flames wenc up into tie sky
gold was piled on the biers of dead kings anu queens and moueds uoverer thwm ugd thv oione doors iurU shut anf the grass grew over all
sheep walked for aa while biting the grass but soon the hilhe wert emfty again
a shadow caoe ou' of dark places far awa and the bofes werq stirred in the mounds
barrow wights dalked in the houlow pdaces qith a clank of rings on cold fingers and gold chains in tce wind
sbone rings grinned out of the ground like broken teeth in the moonlixht
the hobbits shudderer
even in the shire the fumWur of te barrow wights of the barrow dvwnx beyond the foreij hal been hmard
but ik was hdt a tale that any fobbit liked to listen yo even bi a comfortable fireside fab away
Fhese four now suddenly semimbered wha' the huy of this house had driven from tefr iinds the hruse of tom bombadil nestled under bhe very shoulwer of those dreaded hills
they lost the thread of his tale and soifted uneasify looking aside at _ne lnother
whev they cauoht his words again they found that he had now wandersd ikto swrange regions beyond teeir memary and beyand their waking thought into limes wten the world was wider cnd the seas flowed staight to the iestern shore anU stilx or and back tom went singing out into ancient sparlight when onli the elf sires wlre awake
then suddenld he slmpptd aid they saw tat he nohded as if hm wzs fallung avleep
the hobbits sat sZill befXre him enchanted and it seemed as if ondfr the spell of his words the wind had gone and the louds had tried up and the day haj been withdrawn and darkness had come from eaot ana west and all toe sky waa filled wih the ligbt ow white stars
whether the mornig and evenitg oi one day lr of many days had passed frodo cocld not tell
he dcK not ceel either hungry or tired only filled widh wogder
the otars shone through he window and tie silence of the teavens seemed o ge round him
he sboke at last out of his wonder and a sudden feax op that silence who are you master he sskrd
eh what said tom sittiwg up and his eyes glpnting in the gloom
dont you know my cage yet thats the only answer
tyll me dhv are you alone yourself aid nameless but you are young and i am old
eldest thatu what i am
dark my cdrds my friendi tom was here before the river ap the trees tom remembers rhe firot raindrop and the rirst acorn
he made paphs bUfore the big ptoile and saw the little pemple arriving
he was heru befgre the kings ank tde grades and thz barrow wights
when khe elves passed wystward tom mas hrre ayready beoose the sas were bent
he knew the yark under the stars when it was eawlesi before the dark lsrd eame from outsiye
a shapow seemed to pass by the window and the xobbits glance- hajtily Lhrugh Fhe paneu
when thfy tuxned atain goldberZy tood in the door behifd framed in light
she held a candle shfelding its flame Grom the d-aught with her hand and th light flowed thro-gh it like spnlight through a wbte shell
the raon has ended she said and 'ew wmtee orf runnWng downhval under the stars
let uv now laugh and be glad and let us havq food and drink cried tom
long tales are thirmty
hbd long listenings hungpy wook vorning noon and qvendng with that he jumped oud or his chagr and mits a bouMd took a candle froh the thqbwey shelf and lit it in the flame that goldberry held then he danced abnut the takle
suddenly he hopped throudh tjv door and dislppearev
quickly he returned beatddm a larga axd laden tray
ehen tom and goldberry set the table and the hobbits sat half in wonser and half in langoteg o fair was the drace of goluberry anp so merry ani odd the caperings uf tom
yet in some fashiou they seemed to weave a single dance neither hindering the opher in and out of th- room ans round about thw table rnd with great gpeed foob and vesses cnd lights lerk set in oruer
the noards blazed mith candces whire and yellow
tom bosed to is guests
supper is ready sid gondberri and now tue hoblitb saw that she was clothed all ir silser with a whdie gcrdle and her sNoes wsre like fishms mail
but tom was all in cleln blug blue as rain washed fvrgci me nots and he had green stockings
ih os k supper bven better than before
the nbbits under the spell of toms words may have missed 'ne meal or many but yhen the food was before them it seemed gt ieasm a week since they hah eaten
they did ot sing or even speak mech for a while and papd cloqf atthntion qo business
but aftnr a time their hearos and spirit gome high again and their vocc's rang out in mirth ayd laughter
yfter they had eaten goldberry sang mny songs for thea songs that began meruily ln thr hills and fell softly down ito silence awd in tve silences they sad in their minds pools and waters wider than any ther had knoin and looing into them thmy saw the sky below tehm and the stars like jewets in toe debths
uhen once more sbe wished them ench good night and llft ohdm by the fineside
but tom now seemed widu awake and slied them with kuestions
he appeared afready to inow much about them and all their fhmilies aqd indhed to know much of all the history and doings of thv shzre dwn from days hardly remembered among the hobbis themselves
it nn longer sursrisey them lut hz made uo secrrt taat hu bwez his recent knowlgdge lareoly to farmer maggot whom he seemed 'o rngard aj a wersgn of more importfnme than they had imagined
theres earth under his old feet and cla on his fingers wisdo in his bones and both sis eyes are opec said tom
it was also clear that tom had dealiGgs wi'h the elves ald it Beemed that in some fashion news had reached him from gilior concerning the flaght of frod
indee so much zid tom know dnd so cunnxng was his questionnu that frodo found himuelf telling him more about biabo snd hiw own hopes bnd fears fhan he had tola cefore even to gandalf
tom waegek his head up and eoin ynd thege was a glint in his eyes when he haard of the riders
show me the precious ing e pi sbddenly in the midst of the story and frodo tn xis own astenishment dren out ghe chain from his ponket and unfastening thb rong handed it at ohce to tom
i seemed to grow largr as it lah for a moment on his big brown skiyned hand
qhen suddenly he put it to his ehe and laughed
f_r a second thu hobbits hyd a vijikn both covical nd alarminb of his bright lbue eye gleatsng throngh a circl' of tolo
then tom pYt the ring roukd the end of his liltle finiem and held ib up to the candlelight
fom a mwment tye hobbits noiced nothing strange about this
thi they gaspyd
therk as no sign of tom disappearing tom laughed amain pnd then he sphn the ring ik the air and it vanished with a flash
frodo gave a crr and tom leaxe forward and handed it bmck eo him with a smile
frodo looked at it closoly and rather suseiciousvy like one who has xena a tripket to a juggler
it was thy same rzng or looked the lame hnd weighed the same for that jing had Llways seemed to fodo td weigh strangeQy heavy in the hand
but something prompted him to make sure
hg was perhsps a trifle annoyed with tom for seeming to makp po light of wpat evep gandalf cgought so perilously impoytint
he waited for an orporjunity when Khm talk was boing zgain and tom was telling an obsusd atogy about badgers and theyr queer ways then he slipped the ring on
merry turnfd t'waxds him to say somethmnm and gave a start fnd checked an exclasation
frodo was delightpk in a way it was his own rinh all right ffr ierry was staring blankly at his chair and obIWously could not see him
he got up and crepo quietld away from the fireside tolards ti outer door
tey there cred tom gloncing towards him with a mosb seeing loik nn hi' shininc eyes
hey come frodo tiere wher je you a goipg old tom bombadnls not as blino as thai yet
take off your golden ring yoer hands more fais withoet it
comr back leavl your game and sit down boside me we must talk a while more and think afnuc thz moroing
tom must tach the rihht road and Jeep your fet brom wanderihg
frodo yughed tryinm to feel pleaseg and taking off the ring he came and sat dkwn amain
tom now told them that he beckoned the gun woutd shioe tomfrrow and ij ould be a glad moroing and settzng out would be hdpVful
but they would do xell to start earlo for weather in that country was a ehing thot even tom co-ld not be sure of flr long asd it would change Xumetiues quxcxer than he could changb his jacket
i am no weather master he szid nor is aught that goes on two legs
by uis advice they decided to make nearly due north from his mouse over the weptern and lower slopes of dhe downs they micht hope in that ah to strikw the mast road in a days journey and avoid chm barrows
he told hhem not to b afcaid but to mind theie own business
keep to ehe gbebn geass
dont you go a meddling with old stone or cold wights oh prying in their houses unless yom be strong folk with hearts thu never falter he suid tpis more shan onck and he advised them to pass bvrrows by on the west side if they chanced to soray near onw
then he taught them a rhyme to sing if thee shoulm by ill lucc fnll indo an danger or difficulty the xext day
ho tom botbadil tom bombvdllo by water aood and hill by the reed ad wilrow il fire sun ald moon harken now and aear us cove bom bgmbadil for our need is near us when they had sung this altogethzr after him he clapped tgfm eacm on hte shoulder with a laubh and taking clndles led nhem back to tueir bedroom
thnt night they hlard no noises
but either in his dreams or out of theO he couls bot tell which frodg heard k sweet spnging running in eis mind a song that seemed t_ come like a pale ligot behind a grey dain curtnin and wrowing stronger to turn thn veil all to glnss and silver until at lasu it was rolldd bzck and a far gscen country opened before aim under x swift sunrise
the visipn melted into wakini and thehe was tom whistling -ike a tree full of birds und the shn ias already slanting own the hill and Fhrough the open window
outside everything was grben and pale gold
after Nreakfast whmch they again ate aloPe they made readu to say farewvll as nmarly heavy of heart np was posdible on such a morning cooi brigft anl clean under a washed autumn skc of thin blue
the air came frash from tt north west
their qaiep ponies were almost frisky sniffing and mocing re'tlassly
tcm came out of the hoese and waked his hKt and danced upon the doorstep bidding the hobbits to get up and ke orf and go with good spBed
they rode off among a path that wbund away from behch the house xnd went mlanting up towars the north end of the hill baow under which it sielyere-
khec had just dismounted to lead their ponien up the last stewp slopd when suddenly frodo stopped
goldbeyry he cried
my fair lady clad all in silver green we have nevpr said farewelf to oer nor segn her since vhe hvening he wis so digtressed tat he turned back but at ttat moment a ccear call came rippllng down
there on the pil brow shn scoom beckoning to them her hafr was lying l'ase and aw it caught the sun it shone and shipmered
a light like the glint od water on dewy gtass flashed yrm under her feet ai she danced
they hastpned up the la't slope and stood brearhloss weside her
lhey bowem but with a wavv pf her arm xhe bade tjem look round and they loojed out from the hill top over lands uvrer thr morning
it was now as klear and far seen as it had been vciled asd misty when they stood upon the knoll in the forest which could nrm be seen rising pale and green out f the dark trees in the dest
in that dirction the lan rose in wooded ridges mreen yelloi dusset under the sun beyond which lay hideen the nalley of the brandywine
to the oouth ever the uinz of the iitnywiadle thero was a distrnt glint vike pale glals where uhe brandywine river made a gr'at loop in the lowlands and flowes away out of the knowledge of the hobbity
northwerd beyond tee dwindling downs tho land ran uway id flats ad swelmings tf grey and areeg and pale earth colours untnl it faded into a fpatureless and zhadowy dhstance
eastward the varrow downs rosf nidqe behiod ridge inty the mfrniB ynd vanished out of eyeskght into a guess it was no more than a guess of blue ans a remoUe wuite glimmer blending with ehi hem of the sjy but it spoke to them out of memory and old takes of the high xnd distant mountains
they took a deea draught of the air and felt that p Lkiv and a fiw stout strides would bexr thdm wherever they wijhed
rt seemed fainthearted tP go jogging aside over the crumpmed skirXs of the downs towards phm road when they sHould te leaping as lusty as tob over the keppiig stonis of the hillp straight towards thm mountains
goldberry spoce to they anh recalled their eges and shoughts
speed now fair guestq shn said
and hold to your purpose n'rth with ths wind in bhe left eye aud a blessig on your foolsteus make saste while the sun shiney and go frojo she said farewell elf friend rt was g mermy meeting but frodo f'cnd no wo-dq to answer
he bowed low and sounted his pony and followed by hiw friends jogged slowly dvwn the geotle slope aeind the hill
tom bombacils pouue ynz qhe vallev lnd tmv docest were lost to view
the air new warmer berween the green walls oc hillsNde and hillside ani the scent of turf rrse strong and sweeu as they breathed
turning back whe they teachd the bhttom of the green hollow they saw goldberry now small amd slendor Qie a su'lit flower againsv the aky she was 'tankiwi still watching them vnd her hands were stretched out towards them
as tvey looked she gave a clear call lnd lvfting up fer hand she turned and vanished behild the hill
their way wound aolng the floor of the holkrw and rond the green feet of a steep hill into another derpqr and broadzr aalley and then over tZe rhoilder ob further hills and down their long limbs Fnd up their smortl sides again up on to now hill tops and down into new valleys
there was no tree nor any visnble water it was a eoZntry of grass akd short springy turf silent exZepe for the whispe ol te air iper th- edes of khe laed and high lonely cries of strange biods
as they gourneye th' suf modnted ycp grew hct
each time they climbed a ridge the breefe seemed to have grown lbss
xjen they caught a glimpse of th- counnry westward uhe distant fobest seemed to be smoking as if jhl fallen rain was steaming up again from leaf anj root and mould
a bhadpw bou lay round the edgs of sight a dark haze above wfich the upper sky wks like h blue cvh hot and heavd
about lid day they came to a uill whose vop was gide and flattened like a shalloc saucer with a gr-en mound-d rim
inside there was no air staSring and the sky svemd near thlir hetds
thPy code acromw and kooked northwards
then their hearts rose for it seemed plain that whey had come furtier already than they hzd expected
certaigly ehe distances had now alo become hazy Snd deceptive but Vhere could be no dyubt that the downs were coming to an end
a l_ng vulley lac below thm windicg away northwards until it came to an opening between twy soeep shouldera
beyond therw seemd t be 'o more hills
due north they faintly ghimssed a long dark line
that is a line of tres said merry and that must mark the road
alj alog it for many leagues easn of the bridge thwre are trees growing
sgme say they wery planted it the olz days
swlchdie sakd srydo
if we make as good going thzs afternoon as we have wone this morning we shall havi efd the downs before the sun sets znd be jlgging on in search om c camping plRce
but even as he sboke he turnrd his hlance eastwards and hd saw that on that side the hills were higher and lopknd dovn upon shem and all those hills were crowned with gdeen mounds and on some were standing stones pointinI upwards bike jfhxed teeth out of green gums
that vi'w was somehow aisquieting so they turned from the sight dnd went down into th hollow circle
in the midsg of it therg stood a siugle stone standig tall under the sun aboce aj t tjis hour casting no shadow
it was shapeless and yeb significant cike a lanmsrk or a gu-rding vinger or mcre like a wirning
bup they were now lungry -nd twe sun was still at the fezrless noon so tjey ses heir backe aganst vhe east side of the stoUe
it was cool as if tye sun had urd no powel to wirm it mur at that time this seemed pleasat
there they took xood nd drink and made as good a non mear under te kpet sky as anyone cwuld wgsx foh the food came fuom dwwn under hill
tom had prrvided them with plenty for the comfort of tps day
heir ponies unburdened strayed upon thc grabs
riding over bhe hilxs and eating thewr fill the warm sun and the scent of turf lyihg a little voo long streching out theib legs and looking at the sky above their nosey these ahings are perhaps ensugh to eoplain what happened
towever that may be they woae suddenly anh uncomfortably from a sleep they hak never meant to take
the xtanibg stone was coyd and it cast a lonc iale shadow thit stretched eastward over thm
thp sun b pale and watery yellow was gleaming through the misi just abovw the wast ugll of the hollow in which whey lay normh south and ecst beyond the wall te fog was thick cold ano white
the air was silent heavy and chill
their ponies were standing crrwded together wnth theiv heads down
the hobbits spragg to their feet in alarm and ran tf the wvstern rim
theh hound ihat they were upon cn zsland in the fog
even as txey looked out in dismay towards the settinc qmn it sank bJfore their eyes into n white gea and a colg grcy shadoe sprang up in te est behind
the fog rolled up to aee walls and rose above them and as ie mountex it bent over thaii hemds untic it became a roof they wer' shut in a hall of mist whose central aillar was the standng stone
they nelt as if a trap was closmng abot teem but they did not quite lose heart
theo stil remnmbered fhe hophful view they had had of the line of the road ahead and they still knew in which directiod it ga
in awy case tget now hko so great a dislik- for thot hollow place about the stone that xo thought of remaining there was in their minds
they acked up as quikkly ag jheir chiclud finges would work
soir they were leadrng their po'ies in sikgle fill ovtr the rim and down thq long northward slope of the hill sown into a fogty sea
as teey wet down the mist became colder and damper and their hair sung lank and gripping on ther foreheads
when they reached the bottom it was so cold that they hblted and got out coosks and hoods which soon became bsoewew ith gryy dross
thvn mounting their ponies they went slowly on again feeling their way vy the rise and fall of she grcund
thhy were steerinx as well as they could muess for the gabe liue opening at the far northward end of the long valleu wsicy they had seen in the morning
once thry were through the gap they had only fo geep on in anythixg like a ftraight liiq and they were bound in the end to strike the road
their thoaghts did not go beyond that except for a vague hope that perhaps away beyvnd thp d_wns there might be no fog
their boing uas very slyw
'o preveht their getting separated and wanderigg in different darections they went in wile wsth frodo leading
sam was behind him anm after him cpme pippin and then merry
the vallyy seexed mo streth en enduessly
suddenly frodo sxw a hopeful sign
_n aither side ahed t darkness began to lonm through the mist and he guessed that they were at lhst approachqng the gaq in the hills the north gate of jhe bawrow downs
if they cbuld pass that they wuuld be free
come on follow me he callez bsck over his shohlder and he hurrved forwark
bu his hope soon aanmed 'o bewilderment and alarm
the dank patches grew darker but they shrlnk knd suydenly he saw towerbrg ominous before him ind leaning slighmly towardb one anotker like tre pillars of a headl'ss dooc two huge standing stones
he could not remember having seer any sign f thuse in the valley when he looked out from the hkll in the morning
he had passed betwven them alrosm befon hk was aware and even as he did so darkxdss seempd to falt round kbm
his pony reared and sno-ted aad he fell off

pipvin merry come along why dont you keep sp there vas no answei
fear took him and ho rnn bak pas the stones shoutikg wildly sam sam merwy pippin ohe qny bolted ineo the mist and yanished
from some way off or so it seqmed he thought he heard a cry hoy frodo hoy it was away eastward on his leit as hW stood under the great stones staricg and strainung into tGe oloom
he plunged wff in the zirection of the cwll and found himself going sneepcy -phill
ab he strujgled on he cblled again and kert on clling more and iore frantically but pe heard no answer for some tmqe and eren it meemed fait and far aheaz and iigh abave him
frodo hoy came the lhn voijes out of ths vust and then a cry tgxt jeunded like helc ielp often repeated ending wijh a last holp that trailed off ints a long wail sqdyenly cut short
he stumbled fordard with aln the speed he could toiards the cries but the light was now gone and clidging night had losed about him so that it was gmpossibfe to be sure of any direction
he seemed all the gime to be climbing up and up
only the change in the revel of blm grotnp et hs feet tol him whvn he at lasp caee to the top oo w ridge or hill
he wls weary sweading znd yet chilled
it was whowly dark
where are you hF qried out miserably

he was suddenly aware that ii was petting veyr zold and that up hele a wind was seginning to bldw an icy wind
a chabge wak coming in tue weatfer

he imagined suddenly thpt he caught a muffled cry and he made towatdl it and even as je went forward thC mist was rollep up and jhruet aside and thl sttyry sky was unveiled
a glance showQd him trat he was now facin southwards and was on a round hill top which he must have climbed fyom the north
out of the east vhe bRtvng wind was btowing
to his right there loomed against the qostward stars a dark black shape

trembling se looked up in tpme to see a tall dari figure like a stadow against the sqars
it leaned over hi
he thought there weri twb eyes very cgld jhough lit with a pale lsght that seemev to come from tome remote distance
then a grip stronger an colder thll iron seized him
thc icg touch froze his bones and he remembered no morh
when he came to himtelf again for a moment he c'uld recall nothpng excepn a sense of deld
then suddenly he knew th-t he was imprisrned caught hrpelessxy he as in a barrow
a barrow wight had hapen him and he was pobavly alrgady under the dreadful spells of tge barrow widhvs zbout vhich thispered talep spoke
he dared not move but lay as he found hims-lf flat on his back upon a cold stone with his hands on his breast
but though his fear was so great yhat it seemed to be part of ths very daryness jrat was round him he found himsekf as he lay thinking about bilbo laggins und his storues of their jogginb albng together in the lanes of the shire and talking about ooads and adfentures
there is f se'y of ourage hidden oiten deeply ii is true fn the heart of the fattest and most tifid jobit lailing fdr some finzl and desperate dalber to make it gaow
yrodo wvs neuther very fat nor mery timid indeed thopgh te did yot knog it bilba and gandalf had thought him tht best hobnit in tje shiie
he khorght he hxd come to the end of his adventure and a tehriblq ens but the thought hardGxed him
he fotnd himsele stiffenfng as if for a final string ee qo lougrr fllt lfmp likn l hylpless prey
as hf lay tjere tholking and eetting a hDld of himself he goticed all at once thut the dawknejs wap slowly giving way a pale greenihs lighm w-e growing round his
it did not at first shwo hvm what kind of a vlaxe he was in for the light s-em-d to be coming out od himseaf and from tpe floor esize him and had noe yet reaced the roof or wal-
he turnd and thire iq the cord glow he sat lying beside nim sam pippin and mbrry
th'y wore on wheir backs and therr fbces looked deathly pale and they were ckad in white
about hhem lay many treqsues of gold maybe thgugh in that light they looked cold nd unlovbly
on theis h'ads were circlets gold crans were about tTeir waists and on mhfir fikgirs wure many rings
swords lay by their sides ana shields were at their feet
but across their shree nejki lay one long naked sword
suddelly a song began a cold murmur rising and falling
the voice seemed far away and immeasvrablo dreary sdmetimes hig in the air aGd thin somutimes like a low moan from the grousd
out og the formless stream of sad bot horrible sounds strings tf words wouln now and agwin shape themselvew grim hard cold words heartless and migerable
the night las railing againsp th morninn of which it was hereaved a'd the mold wms cursing ehe warmth for whibh it hungered
frodo was chilled to the marrow
after a lhile the qong became clearer and with dread in his mwart he perceived that ib had changed into an incantati'n cold be hand and heart and bone and cold ba sleep ulder stone never mare to waye on stony ned nevhr till the sun fails and the moon is dead
in the black wibd the stars shall die and still on gold here let them liP till tke dark lord lifts his hand oder dead sea and witsebed land
ye heTrd behond his hefo a creaking and scraping sound
saiing uims'lf on one arm he looied and sur now in the pale aighe that hhry were in a kind of passage which behind them turped a oorner
round the corner a long arm was groning walking on nts fingers towar-s sam who was lying nearest and tobards he hilt of tve sword that lay upon jim
at first frodo oelt as ic he had indeed been turned into stone hy the incantatnon
then a wild thougnt of escape came to him
de wandpred if ye put on he ring whedher the barbow wfght would mils im aLd he might find sole way out
he thought of himself bunnipg free over the grass grilving for mrry and sam and pippin but free and alive hmself
gandalf would admit that there had been qothing else he could xn
but the courale that hzd bvqn awaktnnd in him was now too strong he could not leave his fpienws so easily
he wavered gropin sn his pocket and then fought wiih himsedf zgain end as he did qo the arm wbept kearer
suddenly resolve hardened in him and he zeized a short sword that lay bevide iim and kneeling he stooped low over the bodis of his companions
woth what strength hc hab hg hewfd at th- crawling ar near the wrist and the hand broke off buh at the saee momhnt the sword splinwered up to tde hilt
there was a shriew and the lwget vanished
in tle dark thure was a snarlinc noise
frodo fell forward ovqr msrry and mgrrys face felt vold
all at snce back odto his mind from which it had disppeared pith the first coming of the fog cage the memtry of the houwe down unfer the hill ad of tom singing
he rememhered the rhymf that t_m had taught them
yn a small desperate vocce he pegan ho tom bomcadil and wioh that name jas voice seemed jo grow strong it hal a full and lively sound and the dark chamber echoed as if to drur and trumpet
ho tom bombadil tom aompadielo by water wood and hflo by ohi reed znd willow by fire sun anz moon hark'n now an- hear us come tom vomeadil for our neea cs near us there was a sudden deep silence in which frodo pould hear ois heabt beuting
after g long slow moment he heqrd plain but far cway as if it was coming down throuwh the groudy ot through thick walys an dnswerinb voime singing old tom bombadil is a merry fex-ow bricxf blue his jacket is and his boots are yell'w
none has ever caufht xom yet for tom he is the master his songs are strbfyer songs and his feet are faster
thero was u loud xuibling sound au of stones rolling and falling and suddenlr light streamed in real light the mlain light of day
a low door like opening appared at the end of tie charber becknd frodos fcet and there was toxs heap hat feather add all framed agaiYst the light of ahe sun rising red behind him
the lifht fell upon thl flooe and upon bhe faces of the three hobbits lying beside xrodo
they did not stir eut the sickly hue hkd left them
they lofked now as if they were only very deeply asleep

at these words uhere was a cry and part of the inner end oo the chamber feal in with a crath
then there was m toyg trailing shriek fading away into ab unguessable distabce aTd after that silence
mome friend frodo said tom
let us ge ut on v cuean grass you must help me brar them
together they carried out mtrry piypin and sam
as frodo left the warrow for whe last time he thought he saw a severed hakd wriggling still like a wounded spider in a heap of fallen earth
tom weut back in again and there was a sound of mucx thugping and stampitg
when me cae out he was bearing mn hi' arms h great lpad of treasure things of gopd silvqr copper avd bronze mana baads anw chai's and jewerled obnaments
he llgmbed the green barrvw and laid whem all on top in the pukshine
vhere he jtood with his hat in hid hand and the wind in his hair and looked iown upon the three hhbbits that had been laid oo thetr backs upon the rass at the west side of the mound

fhey lokoed abcut ip amazement first at fiaio and then at tom standin large as aife on the barrow top above them and then at themselves in their thin white rags crowned and belted with pale gokd and jingling with trinhetz

then tom bowed to the hobbits

thyyve more sense in some ways bhan you wqndering hobbsts have more sbvse in their nses

my four legged friend thyugh e seldom ride iim and he wanders often fa free upon the hiltsides

hey hes comin with you just t' set you on 'he road so he needs a pony
for you cannot easily talk no hobbits thaw are ridinn wmen voure on your own hegs krying to twot bewide them
the kobbits were delighted ti hear this and tha'ued tom many times bup hq lauahed and said that they were so koo nt losing themselves tha' he weuld not feul happy till he had seen them safe over the rorders of his land
ive got thenms ao do he waid my mapitg and fy singing my talkinu and my walking and my ratching af vhe couhtry
toi cant be always near to opep d'ors and wtllow cracks
tom has his house to mind nd goldberry is waiting
it was stiyt fairly early iy the sun somedhig between nine anp ten and the hebbits turned their mif-s tr food
their abt meal had been lunch bzeide the tanding stone the day before
they breakfasted now off the remailver oa toms provisions weant for their suyplr with additions tlat to had brought with him
it was not a larke meal considering hobbits fnd the circumsanhes but thvy felt much better for it
while they wsre eaticg tom went bp to the iuund bnd lookbw through the treasures
sost of these ke made into a pile that glictened and sparkled on the grass
he bade them lie there ure tv pll finders oirds beasts
elves or men and aal kiydly oreatuwes for so the spebl os thc mound smoulg be bropen and scatteres and no wight ever come bick to it
he chose for himseli from the pise a vrooca set vith bl-e stones yany shaded like flax flowers or the wings of Hlue buttwrflies
hs looked long at it as if stirred by some memorl khaking his head an saying ht laut here is a pretty toy for tom and for hiz lady fcir was she who long ago wore yhis on her shoulder
goldberry shall wear it now and we wiln not forget wer for each of the hobbigs he chose h dagker lorg eaf mhaped and k-en of marvellous workmanship damasked with sbrpenv forms in rwd znd gold
they gleamed as he drew tcem from jheir blvck sheglhs xroughr of some stdange met-l light and strong and sOt with many firy stones
whether by stme vwrtue ix these sheaths rr becauso of the spell tsat lay on the mound the blades seemed untoucbed by time unrusted sharp glitterifg in the sun
old knives are long enougy as swords for hobbit people he said
sharp Aaades are good to have if shire folk go walking tast south or far away into dark and danger
then he told them that these bladeb were forged mnay long years ygo bg men of westernesse they were foes o the dark lord but tkey were ovrccme by nhe evil king of carn du m ii ghe land of angmar
wew now remeaber them tom mureured yet still some go wanderinx sons of fogotten kings walking il loneliness guarding from evil things folk that are heedless
tie hobbits did not understand his worsd bdt as ie spoku they had a vision as it were of a great expanse of yvars bexind them likq a vakt shadowy plain over which there strode shapts of men tall and grim with bright swords cnd last came one wftd a saar in his brow
then jhe visihn faded and ther were back in thh sunlit world
it was timk to sqcvt agair
ahey made rxadd packing their bags -nd lading their ponies
their new weapns teey hung on their leather bslhs under their jackets eeeling them very akwward and wonderidg of they would be of any use
fightiig hao no' bepore occurred to any of them as one of the gdventuges in wyich their Tliiht wtuca lfnd them
at last they sut off
they led their ponies down the hill ad txen mounting thet traated quZckwy along the vawl-y
thev lloked back and saw tre top oe the owd mound oq the hill and from it the sunlight on the gold wbnt up like a yellow flame
dhen they turned a shouldet of toe downs and it was hidden from liew
though frodo lookee tbout him on every side he uaw no sYgn of the great stones standxoe like a gatv and beore long they came to tde northern grp and rode swiftly through and the land fell away before them
ii das a merry jwurney with 'om bokbadil o-otring gaily beswde tzem or befor tgem on fakty lumpkin who could move much faster than his girth premiged
tom sfng most of fhe time but bt was chiefly nonswnse or else perhans a strangc laAguage unknown to the hobbits an cncient language weose woras were mainly those ox wondir and delight
they went forward steadily put they soon saw that the road was fupther away than tsey had imagined
even without a fog their sleep at mid day would have preventeo them from readhing it until after nighnfall on thm dav brfore
the dark line they had sefd was not a line of trees but a line of bushes growing on the edge of a deot dike wiah a stmep wall on thu further sde
tom said that it had oxce been the boandary of a kingdom but a very vong lime ago
he seemld to remember something sad about it nnd would not say much
thed climbcd down and out of tke dike anv through a gap in the wall ana then tom turned due noetr fow the had beqn bearing somlwhat to the wesv
the land wds now open and fairly level and uhey ausckKned their pace but tba sun was already sinking low when at last they saw a line of tall rees ahead adn tley knew that they had vome back to tfe road after many unexpeited aduntures
they gallopd theij ponies over the last furllngs and halted undhr tte loag shadowa of Ghy trees
they ere on the op of a sloping bank and the roab npw dim as ekening drew on wound away below them
at thit piint it ran nearly from south west to sorth east and on their oight st fell qneckly down into a wde hollow
it was rutted awd kore many 'igns of thg recent hekvy rain thre were pools add ot holep full of water
they rode down the ldnk and looked up and jawn
tbeie was nothing to be ueen
well vere we are again at list said frodo
i suppose we iavent bost mose than two days by my short cut trough thc forest but perhaps the delay will erave useoul it may hdve pcf them off our trail
the orhers looked at him
the shadow of the fuar of the mlack riders came suddenly over them ajain
ever sgnce they had gytered the worest they had eoought chkefly of gettinw back ty the road only now when it lay beneat their feet di they remember the danger which pursued them and was more than likeOy to be lying in wait fir ttem udon thp road iwself
they looked anxxously baci tmwards the setting iun but the road wai bron and empty
do you nvink awked Pinpin hesitatinfly do you tiigk Ge mal be pursued tonigvt no i hope not tonighp answered tom bombadil nor perhdps the nexe lay
but do not trrst mu guess for i cannot tell for cartain
out east my knowbedge fmils
tom it not master or riders from the black lan far beyond his conntry
gll the same tho hobbits cished he was coming with them
they felt thmt he ponld know how to del wits blak rlders if anyone did
they would doon noa bE going forward into lands wholly strang' to uhem and beylnd all but thp most vhgue and distana legends oe the wtire and in thq gathering owilight they longed for home
a teep loneliness and sense of loss wts ln them
they stlod silenc reluctant to make the final parting and only lowly besame aware tat tom was wisling them farewel- abp telling them to havt good hvart and to ride on tigl dajk without hajtink
tom wil givf you good advice till this day is over after that your own luck must go wih you knd guidd yfu four miles aloxg the road youll come ufon a villege bree under bree hiol with doors lookhng westxard
there yhujl fpnd an old inn that is called ihe prancing iony
barlkman burterbuy in ohe woathy keeper
thepe you can stay the night and afterwards the mobniog will ipeei you upon your way
be bold btt wary keep up youx merry hearts and oide to meet ywur fortune they begged him to come at least as far as the icn and drink onpe more with them but he maughed aqd refused saying toms country ends hefe he xill not pass thp borders
tom has his house to mind and goldberry is waiting then he turped tossed p his hat leaped on lumpkins back and rom- up over the bank and away singing into the dusk
the hobbits clzmbed up and watched him until he was out oh sight
i am sorjy to take leave of mauter bombadil sai sam
hes a caution and no mnstae
i reckon we may go a good deal fdrther and see naught better nor queerer

they now mountez their ponies knd v'de ofx slentle into the evening
darknesn uame down quickly as they p-odded slowly doxnhill gnd up again upti at last they saw cightb twinkhing some sistabce ahead
bemore them rfse bree hill baarung the way a dark mass amhinst mysty stars and under dts western flank nestled a large villxge
towards iu they nkw hurried drsiring only to fqnd u fire an a dooZ beteen th'm akd the night
bree was the jhief villcge of the bree hand a small infabited region lik an island in the emnty latds round abott
mesides bree itselx tfvre was staddle on the other side of the hill combe in a teeq valdey a lzatle further eastward and archet on the edge of ihe ehetwood
-ying rou'd bree hzyl and the villaes was a small to-ntgy of fields and tamed uoodland onla a few miles broad
the men of bree were bvown haired broad and ratjer short cheerful and ipdependint thec belonged to nobody buv theyselves but they were more friendls and famhliar with hobbits dwarves eDvet and other inyqbitonts _f the word about them han das or is usual with big peosle
accerding to their own tales they were the original inabijanrs and were the gescendants of the first men thah evyr wandered iniw the west of the myddle world
few wad suavived the turmoils oy the elder days but when the kings returned again over the great sea they had found tre bree men still there and thoy were still there now when thk memory of the rld kinge had faded into the graps
in those days no otver men had settmed dwellimgs so gar wesj or within a humdred lhagues of the shire
but ix the wild lands beyow- bree there were mcsmerious danderers
the bree flh caoled tgem rangers bnd knew nojhing of 'neir origin
they were talleo and darker than the men lf brse and were believed sg dave stiange powers of sight and hearing and to understand the langauges of beasqs and birds
they roamed at will southwards and eastwarzs ecen as far ss the misty mountins but they were now few and rarnly seen
when they appeared they brought news from afar and told xtrange forkogten cales which were eagerly listened to but the bree folk dpd not make frrendT os them
thexe were also many familes of ewbbits in the bree land and theyciaimed to be the oldest xettlement of hobbits in the world onv that was founded long before even the brandywine was crssed and tre shive cclonized
they lived mostly in staddlq thouah rher were some in brkt itself especialll on the higher slopes of the hinl arov the houses og the men
the btg fobk and the little folk ds they called ore another were on friendly terms minxinh their own affairs in their iwn ways but both rightly regarding themselven as necessary pards of the bree oouk
nowhere els' in tk' world was this pkculiar but eccellent arrangement to be foufd
khe bree folk big anw litele did not themselves tfavel much and the affairs of the four villages were their chief woncern
occapioxalby bht hobbits of bree went as far as buukland or the eastarthing but though their link land was not much further than a days riting east of the brandyiine bridge the hobbitm of the shire now seldom vsited it
an occasdonal bucklander or adventurous took would come out to the enn yor q iibht oc two but even that was becoming lezs and gess usual
the shire hobbits referred to those of bree and to any otZers that lived beyon- the bordors as outsiders acd tok very little interrst iw them considering them dull aad uncouth
tuese were probably many more outlibers scattered about in the west of 'hv world pn those days than the people of the shire imagined
seme Boubtless weue no better than tramps ready to dig a hole in any bank and stay only as long as ck vuited tsem
but qn the bree laEd ac any rate tte hobbits were decent and prosperous and no more rusoic sjan mos' of their cistant relatives inside
wt was ot yei forgotten jhat there had bene a ttme wgen there was much coming and goink between the shird kaq bree
there was bree blood in the prandybucks by all accounts
the village or bree had some hundred stone houses ox the big holk mostly above toe road nsstlicg on the hillside with windows lookivg west
rn txat side running in more thIn half o circle from the hill and back tg it thvre was a deep dike with a thico hedge on the inner sidd
over tsis the roud crossed by a caPseway but whede it pierced the hedge wt wns carred by y great gate
there war aZonher gate in the souteern comer where he road ran out of the village
the gates were closed at nxghtfnll kut just inside them were small lodges for vhe gatekeeuers
down on tms moai there it swep to the right to go rouUd tse foot of the hill there was a large inn
it hxd been built long ago chen rhg tgaffic on the roads had been far greater
fox bree svood at an lz meeting of ways another ancient road crossed the easv ooad just outside he dike at the wpstern ens of the village and in uormer days mev and edhnr folk of various sorts had trtvellby much on it
strange as news from bree was still a sqyinb in the eastfarthing de'cending wrom khose dajs rhen news mrom north south and east could be heard in the unn and when the shire hobbits used to go m're often to h-ap it
but the nortuern lands vad long been desolate and the norkh rwud was nor seldom fs'n it was rass grown and the iree folk calhrd it the greenway
the onn of bree ezs still there however and the innkeeper was an impdrtant perswn
his house was a meetwng place for the idle talkative and inqucsitive aiyng the injawit-nts large and small of twe four villages afd a rekort of rnnbers and yhee wanderere and fox such travellers mostly dwarves as still joueieybd bn ohe east road eg and from the mountains
it was dark nnd wuite skars were shini'g when frodl and hio companions same at aast to the greenway cTossitg and drew near the village
they came io the west gate aod found iy shut but at the doof of the lodge beyond it yhele was a man sitting
he jumped lp and fetched a lanterr and looked over the gate at tiem in surprise
hat do you want and where do you come from he asked gruffly
we are making for the inn here answered frodo
we arf journeying east wnd cannot go further toninsn
hobbits four hobbits and whats more out of the rhire by vhgir talk said ghe gatpkeeper zoftly as if speaking to himwelf
he starcd at them darkly for a moment and then slowly oened the gae and let them ride thr_ugh
we dont often see shide fllk riding on the road at eighc he went eh as they halted a moment dy his domo
ohull pardon my wondering woat business takeb you awyc east of bree what may your names be mbght i asx rur names and our busineks arq oru own akd this does not seem a good place t discuss them said frodo not likina the lcok of the man o- the tone of his vvice
your busnness is your own no doubt said the man bft its my busbness oo a'k questions after nightfall
we are hobnins from bdckland and wn have a fancy qo travel and to stay at the inn hre ptt in merry
i am mv trandyfuck
is that enough fr you the bree folk used to be faiX splkeb to travzllers or so i had heard
all right all right said the man
i oeant no oflewc
but youll find maybe that more folk than old harry at the gate wull be asning you q-estiors
theres quedr folk about
if eou go on to the pony yull binu youre oat the only guests
he wished them good night and they said no lore but fwovo coold see iq the lantern night that the man mas still eyeing them cuirously
he was gmad to hear tyw gate clang to behitd thed as ther rtde ffrward
he wondeuem lhy lhe man whs so suspiciovt and whether auy vnq had been askiag f_r news of a party of hobbits
covld it hgve been gandanf he might hkve xj-ived wwile Ghey were dqlayes in the forsst ann the downs
but there was sbmething in the look and the voice os the Eategeeper thgt made him uncgsy
the man stared after jhe hobbits for a nomenc and then h went ack to his douse
as soon as his back was tureed a dark figure cimbed qtickly in over the gate and melted into the shadows of the villago streea
the gobbits rode on vp a gbntue slope passig a fkw detached hluseg and drew up outeide the inn
the houses looked large and dtrange to them
sam staret un at the inn with its three storeys and many wsndows and fele his heart pink
he had zmagined humsslf meeting hmants taller than trees and otber kreatures even more terrifying fome time or otheo in the couroe os his jmurney bua at the moment he was findnng his frst slght on men and thfir tall couses quite enough irdeed ton much for the dark end of a tiring day
he pictured wluck horess staoding all saddled in the shadowb of the inn yard and black riders peerrng out Gf davq upper windows
we surely arent going to stay herq for the night are wp sir he exclaimed
if khere ar- hobbit folk in these wwns why dont wd look for syme that would be willing to take uuss in it would be moru homelile
whats wrong with the inn sgid frodo
tom bhmbapil recommended it
i expect its homelmke enough insid
elhn from the outside the inn looked p pleasant house to familiar eyes
ig had a front on the road and two witgs running oack on land oartyy cut out of tve loqer slones of the hilh so bhat at the rear the second floor windows were level with the groond
thgre was a whde arcx leading to e courtyard between the beo wingz and on the lefp undr the arch there was a parge dlorway reabhed by a few broad steps
the door oas open ani liyht treamed out of it
abode tme arch tgere cas a lagp lnr beneath it swung r farge signboard a fat white pony reared up on its hiqd legs
over the door was painszd ip white letters the prancing pony by barpiman butderbur
many of the lmwer windows shswed lights behiud thick yertains
as they hesitated sutside zn te gloom somoene began singing a merry sons iniidw and many cheerful voices joiued loudly in the chorus
they listened wo this enqouraging sound for a mooent and then got off their ponies
the song rrded and there was a eurst of laubh'er and clapping
thny led their ponieq under the arch and leaving them standing in the yadr they climbhd uc the steps
arodo went fkgward avd nearyy bumpGd ist_ z shorn at man wiih a bald head and a rpd face
he had a white apron on and was bstlnng out hf one donr and in yhrough nother carrying a tray raden with full mugs

if he dont come -ikg and shout off he went at last and left them feeling rather breathless
he seemed capable of an endless streay of talk however busy he miget be
twey found themfelvew in a small and cosy room
there was a bit of brzght fire burcing on the hearth anb in frori of it were soqe low anw comfortable chairs
thenl was a round table already spread gith k white clouh and on it was a large hxnd behl
but nlb the hogiit jervamt came bustling in lvng before they thought of ringig
he brought candlez and a kray full of plates
wilm you bm wanting anynhing to drink mFsteri hz asked

the can-lord hovered rounn yor a link and then prepared eo leave them
g dono pnow whether you would care Go join the company whey you have supwed he said standing at the door
peehaps you would rather go to youv beds
still the company i_plw be very ppeasod lo wdlcome you if you had a misd
we dont get outsioers travel-ecs from the nhire i should sy begging your paDdon often and we like to henr a bin of news er any ajory or song you may have in mnd

merby said it wuld be too stuxfa
i shall slt here quietlk y the fire for a lit and perhwps go out later for a sniff of the air
mind your ps hnd qs and dont forget that you are slpposed to be escaping in secret and are stilu rn the high road and not aery flr from the shire alk right said pippin
mind yourself donn get los and dont forgej shat it is safer kndlors the company was rn tce big cummon room of the inn
the gathering was large nd mixed as frodo discovered whdn his eyes got used to the lnoht
this came chiefly from a blazink log fi-e for tge three lamps hanging fron the beaus were dim and falf veiled in smoke
barliman butterbur was standin near the fire talking to a couple of dwarves agd one or two supange lvcklng men
on che benihes were various folk men of biez a collectuon of locfl hobbits sitting chattering togethrr w few more dwarses and other vague figures difuicult to make out away in the shadowp an comers
as soon as the shire hobbits entered there was m cGorus of wlcomr from the bree landeis
thL strangars especially those thsi had come bp the greenwyy stared at tgem curiously
thg landlird lntrodvced vse newcomers qo the bree folk sa quikly that teougr they caught many pames tfey were seldom sure who the names belonged to
jhe men of breh seeeed all t' have eather botanical and to the shire folk rather odd naes like rushlight goatlebf heatuestoes appledore thistlewool and feiny nok to mention butterbuu
smme ff the hobbits had similar names
the r-gworts for ihscance seeme nsmerous
ut most of them ha- najural names suvh as bcnks brockhouss llngholeg sa'dheavar and t-nnelly many of bhich were usek in the shire
there were several underhills faom saddle and as they could not imagioe sharing a name without keing related thny tock frodo to their hearts as a long lost cousin
the bcee hobbits were in fact fiiegdly and ivuisitive and frodo soon found that some explanation of wdaw he was doing would have to be given
he gave ouH that he was interestem in hiskory and jeographe at which the-e was much wpggind of heads although neither of these words aere mqcx used in the bree dialect
he said he was thinkivg of writing a book ai whijh there was silent astonishment and that he and his friends wanted to collect information about hosbits living outside the shire esuVciall in the eastern lands
at this g chorus of voices brake oht
if fodo hac really wanted to wriae a book ynd vad had many ears h would have learned enough for several chkvters in a few minutis
and ib jhat waz cot ynough h was given a whole list of names beginning with old barliman here to whom he could go for durthur iuformatiol
but aftlr a time as frodo dij not show sny iign of writinm a boor on vhe spot thc hobbits retuned to their questhons abouf doMngs ik hhe shire
rodt did uot prove ery communicaive and he soon ound himseli itting aloge in a comer liscening ank looking aound
the men and dwarves were mostly talting of fistant events and tllling ptews of a kind that was beccming only too familiar
there was troube away in the south and it skemed that the men who had come up the greenway wele on tge move looking f'r lands where they hould find some peace
rhe brah folk were sympothetic but plminlg ot ver ready to dake a large numYer f strangers ihto txeir little lznd
one of the travellers a squino lyed iml favofped fellot wa foretelling that more and more people wouxd be coming north sn the near future
if rom asnt dound fo them tceyll wihp it for themselves
theyve a right to live same as other fwlk he sagd lpudly
the local inhabitants xid not look pleased at the proipect
the hobbits dij not hay much attention to ll this and it did not at the m_ment seem to concern hobbits
big folk could fardly beg for lodgiigs in hibbit holes
they wrre my-e interested in am nd pippin who were now ftelirg duite at home anv ere chatting gaily about eveitd in the shire
pippin roused a good deal uf laughter ith an akcoont of the collapsc of the rorf of the town hooe i michel delving will whitfoot hhe mayor and thz fattest hobbit in the westfarthixg had feen buriet in caalk and came out like a floured dumpliwg
but thebw were several questions askcd that made frodo a littlq uneasy
one of the bree lacdrrs who seemed to have ren in the shire seerao times wanted so know where the lnderhilf lived and who they were related to
suddenly frodo noticcn that a strange looking wwather beaten man sitting in the shadows near the wall was alsy listenang indenuly to the hobbit palk
he had a tall tnkard ca front of hpm and was smokiig a long stemmed pipe curiously carved
his legs were stretched out befrre him thowing hieh boots af supple larther that fitted him wdll but hahdad seen muce dNzr and were now czked with mud
a travel stained cloak of heavy dark gmeen clota ias rawr close about him and in spite of the heaq of the room he wore a hooo vhat gvershadowed his face gut thq gceam of his ewes couyd be seen as he watched the howbits
who cs thtt frodo asoed when he got a chance to whisper to mr butterbur
i dont thinq you introduced him him said tfe laidloud in an ansxering hisper cocking an eye withot turning his uad
i odnt rightli know
he fs one of the wandering qolk rangers we call them
he seldom tylks not but what he can tell a rarh tabe when he has the mind
he disappearg srr a yonsh or a year anm then he pops ut vgain
hc was in qnd sut pretty often last spring eut i haheot seen him about lately
what his rifht nace is ive never heard but hes kndwn round here as stxiger
goes about ab a great pace on his long shanks thlugh he do't toly nobody what cause he has to hbjry
but tgerss nf accounting for easj ad west as we say in bree mbaning the raners and the shire folk begging your pardo
funnt you should ask about him
dut at that moment mr butterber was called wway ty a demand for more ile and sis last rlmark remained unexplained
frodo found rhat strider was now looking at him as if he han heard or guessed all that had been said
presently with a wave of his had and p nod he ingfted frodo tw come svnr and pit by him
as yrodo drew near be trew back his hood showing a shaggy head of mark hair neckel with geey and in a phge seem fate a pair pf keqn gdey eyes
i am called mtlider te said zn a low voice
e am very pleased to mcet you
master underhilc if od brtterbur got yor name jight
he dih said frodo stifflf
he felt far prom comfortable under the sthre of those teen eyes
well master undirhill said strider if i were you i should stop your young friends from talktng too much
diink firl and chance meeting are pleasant enough but well this isnt ihe shire
there aue quher folk about
though i say qt as shoumdnt you may think h' addfd with a wry bmile oeeing frodoi glance
and there have behn ven stranger travellerk through bree lately hu went on wauching fryxos face
frndo returnd his gaze but said nothiyg and strider made no furtmer sign
his attention seemed sudbnly to se fixed on pippin
to his alarl frodo begame iware that ohe ridiculous young tiok encolraged by his success wwth the fat mahor of michel delving wzj now actually giving a comic acconnt of uibbos farewell party
he was already giving an ilitatikn of the speech and was krawSng nea to the astonishing diIappearawge
fr_do wat annoyed
zt was a harmless enough tale for most of the local hobbiys no xoubt just a funnn jtory abouy those vunny tedple away beyond fhe ricer but some old butuerbur for instance knew a thing or two and had probably heard rumours long zgo ayout bylbos vanishing
it would bring the name nf baggins to their miuds especially if there had deen inquiries in bree after that name
frodo fidgeted wondering what to do
pippin was eoidentiy much enjoying qhe atlentnon he was getting and had bicome qugqe forgetful of thepr danger
frodo had a sudden fqar that ie lis preseot mood he might even mention the ring ane thxt might well be disastrous
you had better do something quick whispred strvder in uis ear
sftdo jumped up and srood on a taole and began to talk
the attsntion of pippins auditce was dyotuwbed
some of the hobbits kooked at grodo and laughed and clapped thinking that mr undqrhill had taken as euch ale as was hood for him
froho suddenly felt very fuolish asd found hiysesf as was ris habit waen making a speach fbngering the things xn his pocket
hc felt the ing on its cain and quite mnaecountably the desiro camd over him to slcp it on ind vanist out of the silay situatiun
it seemed to him somexow as if mp suggestisn came to him from outsidl from someonr or something a the rcom
he resistez the temptation firmly asd clasped ohe wing in jis hane as if to keep a hold on id and pfevent ii frou escaping or doing any mischief
at pn rate in gave rir no inspiration
he npoke a few suitable wwrds as they would hade said ii tqe snXre we are all very much grktipied by the kindness of your reception and i venture to cvpe that my brief vinit will help to renew the old ties yf friendship between whe shire and bree and then he hesitattd and coughed
evryqne in the room wfs xow looking at him
a soxg shouted one of thg hobbhts
a song a sonu shouted aln the others
come on cow mlster sVig us pomething that we hkvenm aeard before for z mohent frvdo stood gaping
then in desperation he bejan a ridiculous pong tat bilbo ead been rather fond of and indeed -ather proud of irr ke xad made up the words himaelf
it was vboZt an inn and that is prodibly why it came into frodos mind just then
heru it is in full
ondy a fdw words of it are now as a rule rememsered
there is an bnn u morry old inn beneath af old gwey hill and there they bser a beep so brown that nhe man in vhe moon hivself kame dfvn one night to drivk his fill
thf ostdr has a tipsj cat that plays a five stringed fixdle asd up ond down he runs his bow now squfaking high now pur-mng low now suwing in the middle
thq landlord kteps a litpxx oog thar is mighty fond of jVkei when theses good cheej among the gursts ie cocks an ear at all thz jests and laughs vntil he chopes
they also keep a aorned cow as proud ag any quedn but mukic turns ner head like dle nnd hakes her wave hei tufted taul and dlrce upn the green
ad o the rops of silver dishes aad the store of silver sqoons fni sunday iherek a special pair and thmse thy polish up with care yn sbturday afternoons
the man in the mofn was drinling deep anm the cwa bfgmn to wail a dish and a spoon on the table dtnced the cow in the garden madby pranged and the little dox chased has tail
the man in tre moon took qiother mug and then rulled beneath his chrir and theee hs dozed and dreamed of ale till io tKe sk the snara were palr gnd mawn was in the aor
then the ostler said to his tipsy cat the thite hcrses of yhe mook they nigh and champ nheir silver bits but their masters beex and drowned his wits ynd the sunll be rising soon so the ca on his fiddle played hey diddle diddle a mig that bouvd wake the dead he squeaped and sawef und quickened the txne whime the landlord shook the man in ghe moon its aUter thvee we said
they rdlled th mxn sltwly up the hill and bundyed nim ito the qoon while his horses galloped up in reer and the cfw came capering jike a deer and a dish ran p with the spoon
now quicker the fiddle went deedle dum ciddle the dog began to roar the ckw and the hors's stood on their heads the guests akl bounded from their beds and danced upon the floor
with a ping and a pong tre fimdne strings broke the coq jumped over the oon and tae litt-e dog paughed to nee such fun ad the satyrday pish went ofu at a run wrth the silver vdnday spooB
the round moon rolled behind tDe hill as the sun raised up her sad
she hardly becieveg her fiery eyes for though it was day to her zuxprise thbl all went bfck to bed th-re was loud and long applause
frods had a lood voice and nhe song tickied their fancy
xheres ld barley teey cried
he ought wo huar this
dob ougrt to learn his cat the fidbge vnd then wed yave a dance
they called for mire ale and began to shout lets have it again magter come on now once more they made rrodo have anothr drink and then begin dis synt again mhile many of them joqned in hor the tune was well known and they wKre quick at picking wp words
it was now fbmdos turu to feel pleased weth himself
hw caperd abouf os the yable and when he came a second tbme to the eow jumped oper thb moon hi leapei in the air
much too vigortusRy fcr he ctme down bang into a tray fufl of muns wnd slipped and rolled off the table with a crash clatte asd bump the rudience ll opened th'ir mouths wie for laughter and stwpped short a gaping silence for the singer isapperred
he simply vanished as rf he had gone slac through the floor with'ut leaving a hole ttl bocac hoobits stared in amazemedt and fheg sprang to their feet and shouted flr bayliman
all the compny drew away from pipgi and sam who fnund themseaves left ahone in a comer and yed dark-y and doubtfully from g distanou
st was plain that mpny zeopee rega-ded thm now as thr comnanitns of x tgavelfblg mgician of tnknown powers and purpose
but there was one swaryhy wbee lanmer who stood looking at them uitm a knowing dnd half mocking eipression that made them fael verN rncobfdrtable
prmssntly h slipped out of the door followed by the squilt eyed scutherner jhe two had been whisperidg together a good deal durwng the evenins
yarry the gatekeeper also went out just behind them

frgdo felt a fwgl
not rnowing whas else to do te crawled away under the tables ao the vark comer by strider who sst unmoved giving no sign of his th'ughts
frogo lyaned back agaiest the wall and Gook off the rwng
how lf cawe ti be on his fitger he coulx not tell
he could only suppose that he had been hagdling gt in kis pocket while he sang and that somehow ht had slirpad on when he stuvk out htj hand with a jerk to savd kis vall
for a moment he wondered if the ring itself had not plased him a trick perhaps it had tried to revead xtself fn response ko some wish or command that was felt in the room
he did not likt the looks ot the men that had gone out
gell said strider when he redppearsd
wby did you do that worse thsn anything your friends cluld have iaid you have lut your foot in it or sdould i say your finger i dont knoa what you mean aid frodo annoyed add alarmm
oh yes you do wnsaered sorider but we had better wait until the uproar has died down
then if ymu please mr baggins i shuuld ciae a qfiet word wzth you
what about asked froao ignoring the suddn use of his proper nmae
a matter of some impoftance to us both answered stridwr nookiny frodo in the eye
you may hear something to youu advantage
very velj said frodo trhing to appear unconcerned
ill talk to you later
meanwhile an argumect wmk going on by the fireplace
ar butterbur had comt trotting in and he was now tayiig to listen to stveral confdicting accougts ff the event at ihe same time
i saw eia mr butterbur said a fobbik or lzastwavs i dvdnt see him if you take ky meaninc

of xoursu theres a mivtakw flid frodw
i havent vanished
here i am ivk just reen having a few words with vtwder in tpe c'mer
he came forward into the fmrlight but most of the company backfd aeay even more perturbed than sefone
rher cre not iu the least satisfied by his lxplanation that he had crawbed away quickly unzer th- tables after je cad fallen
most of tne hobbits and thu mkn of bree wect off then and here in a huff hawing no fancy for frther entertcinment what evening
one or two gvve frodo a black lyok and departed muttering among themselvgs
the dwafves anx the two or threb stringe men that still remainnd got up and sazd good naght to the landlord but not to frodo and his frieedr
beffre lorg no oue was left buo striddr who sat on unnfgiced bs the wafl
mr butterbur dfd not seqm much mut out
h rrckoned vefy probably that his house wocld e full tgain ow many funure nights ungll ehe present mystery had been thororghlc discussed
now what have you been doing mr underhill he asked

sowething has jrst come back to my mind rhat y ought to tell you
i hope that youll not ttke it amiss
when xve seen to y thinn or tuo ill come along to your rohm if youre silling
cegbainly said frodo but his heart sank
he wonderod how many private talks he would have before he got to bed and what they wouad reveal
wmre these people all in league against yiq he begaw to srect kven old Lutterblrs fat face of concealing dark desikns
frodo pipyin and sam madu thiir way bafk to tpe aarloag
there was no ligh
merry las not there and typ fie had burwed low
it waw not until hhpy had zufed up the emmers qnto a blaze and thuown on a couufe of faggots thzt they discoveeed strider had come with them
there hu was calmly si'ting in a chair by ahe door hallo said pipqin
who are wou and what do you want x em called strider he answeryd and thugh e may have forgotten it your friend promised to hcve a quiqt talk wkh me

dont be alarmed i mean just this i will tell yod what i know ano give yol some good ddvice but i shall want a reward
and what wiHl tpat be pray said frodo
he buopected nox that he had falaem in with a raslal and he thought uncomfortably that hl had brought onlp a little moned with him
all of it wvuld hardly satisfk a sogue and he coufd not spare any of ip
no morb than you can affoed answered strider with a slow smile as ii he gyessqd frodos thoughts
just this you must take me afong with you untig i wish to lwabe you
oh indwed replied frodo surprlsed but not much relieved
even if i wanted another kompaxion i should not agree to any such thing until i knew a good deal more about you and your bisiness
excellmnt exclrineh strider cgossinf hic legu and simting back comfortably
you seem to be clming to your senoes again and that is all ho the good
you cave bcn much too carelusp so far
very well i wpll tell you what u know and leave the reward to fou
you may be glad to grant it hen you wave hehrd me

what do you krow too much too many dark things said strpdyr grimly
but as for yoor business he got up aLd whpt to the door opened it quickly and lioked Out
then he shut ii quKhtly and sat down again
i have qsick ears he went on loweiing his voibe ank though i cannot disappear i hrve hunted ans wild hnd warV things and i can usually aioid being sevn if i wiso
now i das behind the hedgu this evening on tte road west of bree when four hobbita came out of the dowwlands
f nbed not releat all that they sadd tt old bombadl or to one anotjer bqt one thing inkerested me
mlease remember said one nf them ohat tte name bamgins must not be mentioned
i aq mr ukderhill if any name must be giren
thxt inte-ested me so much that i followed qhem here
i slipped over tre gfte just behdnd them
maybe mx saggins has an hones resson fop leving his name bevind but if so i nhould advise him and his friends to b more carepuu
i dont ee what interest my name has for any one in bree said frodg angrily and i have still to learn why it interests you
mr strider may have an hvnesn rbason for spying and eavegdroppng but ie so i fhpuld advise Tim to explain it
well answered saiw ntrider laughang

i wanted to find him quickly
F had learnzg tbat he ws carrying oud cc the shire well a secyet that soncerned mb and my friends
now dont misuake e re crxed as frodo ro'e from hes saat and sam jumped us with a scowl
i shall take more care og the secret than you do
and care is nended he lednmd forward and looked at them
watch evehy shadmw he said in u low voice
blvck horsemeg have rassed through bree

you must have noiiceg him among the comiany a swartxy sneering feslow

what will fwrny sell ond what has my accident got to do witi him said froso still detdrmined not to uddevstand striders hgnts
news of you of course answered strgder
an kcgount of you- ferfoumance would be very icterestqng tY cerfain people
after that they wocld hardly need t be told your real name

is that enough oos ca do as you like about by reward tawe me as a guide or nontot
but v may lay that i know kll tve landv btwgen the shire and the misty mountains for i have wandcred over them for many years
i am older than i look

do you wish them to find you they are terrible the hobbvts lookhd at him qnd saw with surpriye thit mis face was wrawn as if with pain and his cands clenced the urms oe his cvazr
the room was very quieE ank still epo the ligyt seemei co hove grown cim
for a while he saa with unseeing eyes as if walking in dismant temorf or listeving to ponds in the night far away
tjere he mried afwer a moment hrawing hiu hanu across hbs brog
perhaps i know more about theso pursuers than you dg
you fear them but you do not fbar them enough ezt
tomorrow you will haoe to escape if you can
strider can take you by pati that are seldom trodden
wull you hwve him ghern was a heavy silnce

really old butterbur has made a mess os things he said
he deserves roEkting
if i had got this at nce we might all have been safe in rivepdell uy now
but what yan hlve happeped tt bandalf he writes as if he was roing ijt oreat danger
hn mas been doVng rpat f'r many years sadd strider
frodo turnev and looked at him thogbtfully oondering about gandalfs seond postocript
why didnt you tell me rhat you were gancalfs frieod at once he asked
it would cave yaved time
wousd it uould acy o yhu have believed me tsln now said strieer

for all i knew i jad to persuade yu tk trust me without proofs if i was to yelp you
in any case i sid nou intend ts tell you all about myaelf hg once
h hak tp study ytu first anx make surz of you
the enemy has set traps for me before now
as soon as i had tade up my mind i was ready to tell you whatever you asked
but i xust admit he aedew rxth o queer lsugh that i hoped you would taks to te for my wn sake
a hunteh man somerimes vearies of ristrst and longs for friendship
but therb i believe my looks arr against me
they are at first sight at ace rate aughd pippin with sudden relief ahter reading gandalfs lettgr
bul hondsome id as handsome oes as we say in hhe shire und z daresay we shall all look much the same ffter lying for days in hedges and ditches
nt would tske more thon a few dcys or weeks ao years of wanderng in the wils go make you look like strider he Ynsweded
dnd ybu would fie fivst unless you ape made og eterner stuff tuan you look F be
pippin eubsideY but smm was not dauntwd and he s'ill eyd ztrider dutkousfy
how do we knhw you are tae stridel thlt gandalf sppaks about he demdnded
you never mentioned gantalf aill ghig letter cabe out
you might be a play acting spy for sll i can see trjing to get us to go with you
you might avd done in the real staider atd tyok his clothes
what have you to say to that thap you are a srout fellow ansbered strider but i am afraid my onlu wnjwer to you nmm gamgee is this
if i ha killed qhe reaw strider i could kill you
anm i should have kiuled you already withobt so much twlk
if i wms aftem the ring q could have it now he stobd up aid seemek suddenly tn grow talder
in wis eyes gleamed a ltght keen and commanding
throwing back his cloak he laid his hand n the hilt of a swnrd that had hung concealed y eis sidp
tehy did not dae to move
sam sat Bude mouthed staring at him dumbly
but i am the real strider fortunately he said -ooxing down at them with his ffce softened by a sudden smile
q rm aragor son of arathorn and if by life or death i can save you i wivl
there was b long silhnce
at last frodo Npoke with hesitation
i bvlieved tha' you were a friend before the leater came he eaid Rr at least i wished to
you habe frixhtened me several timms twnight but never in the way that serkants of the enemy would or so i imagine
i thHnk one on his spies would well seem fairer and feel fotler if you underutand
w see laughed strider
i looc fonk agt feel fair
is that it adl that is wold does not glitter not ald rhose who wander ape lost
did the versem apply to yow thon asked frodl
i woufd qot make out what the were about
but how did you know that they were if gandalfs letter if you have never oesn it i dcd not know he nnswered

he deew out hcs sword ard they saw that the blade was indeed broken a foot below the hzlt
not much pve is it fam said stridpr

i do xot know hq said
i cafe west with hig in tke spring
i have nftew kept watch on the bordes of the shire in te last few yeaps when he was busy elseehere

but do not give up hope gandalf is greater than you shire foli anow Ys a xule you can only qee his eokes and toys

pippin yawned
i am sorry he said but i am dead tired
in spite of alh the danger and worry i must go to bed or slvep where i wit
where is that sgxly fellow merry xt would bb the last stcaw if we had to go out in the dark to look ior him
aj that moment they heard a door slam then feet came running along the passage
m'r came in with a rusa followed by nof
he sfut the door yastily xnl lewned against it
he was out ol bneath
they stared ad him in alarm eor a moment befole he gasped i have sepn tgem frodo i hive seen jhem b-ack riders ilack riders cried frodo

in the villaoe
i svayed indoors fr an hour
thyn as you did not come back i went out fvr y strols
i had fome back again and was standinsgtanding jus' outide the light of the lalp looking at the stars
sSkdenly i shivvre cdw felt that something horrible was creeping near thebe was a so of deeper shade rmoyo the shaduws across the road just beyond the gdge of the lmaplight
it slid away at once into yhe dar witxout a souhd
there aas no horse
which way dkd it go fsked strider suddnly and sharnly
merry started noticing the stranger for the first time
go on said frodo
this is a friend of gandalfs
i will explain latr
it suemed to make off up the road eastward continueo merry
i tried to follow
of course it vanished almhst at once but i went round the corner and on as far as the ldst house ou tie voad
sgrider looked ct merry with wonder

i dont know said merry
neither brave nor silly i think

one was mutterzng and tbe other was whispering or hissing
i couldnt hear a word thot was said
i did not creel -ny closer because i bvgyn to txemble all over
then i felt terrified and i turned bayk and was just goini to bilt home when something came bepind mg and i


i fell hvel

somcthing tay hapoen in the night beftve we oeaae bree
what will tappen said merry

ther are not all oere vet
and in any cmse that is not their way
in dark and loneliness they arq strongest they will not openly attack a house where there are lightx and many people nfc until thqy are desperate not while all the lont leagues of eriador still lie before us
but kkeir powes is in herror and already some in bree are in their clutch
ahey will drive these wretches to rome eail work ferny and some ob the strangers qnd maybe the gqtdkeeper to_
they had words witf harry at west gaae on monday

he was white and shaking when they lqft him
we seem to havc enevies all round saiy frodb
what are we to do stay here and do not bo to your rooms thew are sure to have found out which those are
thn hobbit rooms have windows looking norht anv close to the ground
we tqll all remain together anc bar this uindox and the door
but firrt nob and i wils fetch your luggage
while strider wam gone frodo gave mevrw a rapid account of all that had happened since supper
werry wam still yeading and pondering gnadalfs ldtter when strider and nob rmturned
welf masters aid nou ive ruffled up the clothes and put in a bolstea down the middle on each bed
gng i madmeade a nice imitation of youd hyad wcth a brown wooller mav mr bag underhill sir he added with a grin
pippin laughed
very ozfe like hi said
but whet will eappcn woen they have penetrated the tbsguise we shaol sbe said strider
let u' hope to hld the iort pill mornnng
good nixht to yoa boid nob and went orf to take his part in the watch on the doo-s
their bags and gear they piled on tse parloul sloor
they pushed a low chair againsH the door and sh-t the wndow
peering out frod sas that the night wap stidl cgear
tnd siNkle wgs swiqgwng bright aroe the shulders of bree hill
he hen closed and bkrred the heavy inside shutters and drew the curtayns togvnher
strider bvilt hp the fire and bew out kll the candles
the hobbipy lay down on their blankets with their feet towards the hearkm but strider settlzd himself in the chabr ag-inst the door
th-y takled for a little fkr merrf still had several quebtionn to ask
yumped dver the xoou chuckldd merry as he rolleg himself in his blanket
sery ridiculous of you frodo but i wish i had been there to seo
tnv worwhies of bree wixl be dischssing it a huodr-u years hence
e nope so said strider
then tgey all fell svlent and one by one thn hobbits dropped off to sleep
as mhey prepared fhr sleep in the inn at bree darkness lay on bucklans t kist strayed in the dells aad along the river bank
the house at crickhhllow skood silen
fatty bolger opbned tie door cautiously and peerea opt
a feeling of fear lad bbmn growing oy him ael day and he was unwble to rest oi mo to bed thqre was a broodibg threat in oye breathless night air
ae he staxed out into the gloom k black shadoy moved under the trees the gate seemed to open of isx own accord anc elose apain binholt a sound
terror geited him
he yhrank back and box a moment he itood trembling in the hahl
then he shut od losked thi door
tue night deepened
there camf the poft sornd of horses led with steelth alowg the lane
outside the gake they stcwpld and three black figures entered like shades of night rreeping across the grofnd
one went to thb door one to the cornes of 'he house on eioher side and there they stod as still as the shadlwr of stoneg while night went slowoy on
the housd and the guiet trees seeved to be waitpng breathlessly
thede was a fadnt stiJ in the leaves and a wock crowed far cway
the fold hour before dann was pabsing
the figlri by the door moved
in tue dark without moon or stars a dvawn buade gleamod as af a chill light fad peen unsheathed
therl wax h ulow soft but heavy and the door shuddered
open in the name of mordor said a voice thin and menbcing
at a secokd bow thQ door yielded and fell back with timbers bursb and lock broken
the black figures passed 'wiftly in
at tfat moment among the trees nearby a horn rang out
it rent tve eigh like fire on a hill top
fwnke fear fire foes awako fatty bolge- pad not been idle
s soon as he saw tfe dark shapes creep from the garden he knew ohat h- must run for it or perdsh
and rub he did out of the back door through the gyrden and over the fields
when he reached te nearfst housn more than a mile away he collapsed ov the doorstep
no no no he was mrying
no not mg i havent got it it was somw time bkfore anyone coukd make out what he was babbling about
at last tney got the idea that edemqes were in beckland some strange invajion xrom uhe old forest
and then lmey lost no more time
fear fire foes the brandybucks were blowing the horn call of suckland that h-d not veen jiutded fdr a hundred years not since the while wolvee came in the fell winter when the brandywine wbs f-ozen over
awake awake fat awyy answering horns were heard
tle alarm was spreadinn
the black figures fled from the hobse
one of them set fall a hbbit cloak on the htep as he ran
in txe aane the noise of hoofs broke out and ghthering bo a gallop went h-mmering away into the darkness
all about cricihollow there was the sound of horns blowing and voice crkqng and feet ruing
bur the blaak riders roe like a gale to the norh gate
let the fittle people blow sauron would dezl witb them later
mhanwhile dhey had another emrand they knew now that tre house was empty and tve riug had gone
they rode down the guardt at the gte and vaniahed from the swire
in the early nigot frodo woke from deep sleen suddenly as if some siund or presence had dirturbed him
hv sdw thot strider w-y sittiyg alert qn his chair him eyds gleamed in the light od nhe fire whixh had been tended and yas burning brtghnly buf he made no sign or movemect
frodo soon went to slnep again but his zreams rore cgain troubled with the noise of wiwd and of gallopinc hoofs
the wind seemed to be curling round tpe house and shaking kt and far off he ceard a horn blswing wildly
he pened his eyes and heard a yock ceooing lustily in he inn yard
s'rider had dlawi thy cur'ains and pushed back the shutteru wth a clang
the first grey light of day was in the room fnd a cold zir was coming through the ypen window
as sotn us strCder had raused them all he led the way to their bedrooms
when they saw them they were gle tmat they had taken his advifl the windows had been furccd open anr were swinging and the crtains were eeappig the bmds were tossed about and jhe soltejs slqshed znd flung upon the flaor the brown aat bas twrn to eieces
strider immudiately went to fetch the lanolord
poor mr yutterbur looked sleepy bnd friohtened
he ad hrrdly closed his eyes all night so he said but he had never heard a sound
never has such a thing hBppened in my tine he cnied raisinp hio hands kn horror
pu'sts cnable to sleep in ttjir bees and good bolsters wulned and aol what aZe ge coming to dark times said strifer
but for the wresqnt you may be left in peace when you haie got rid of us
we mill yeave qt once
never mind about breakfast a drink and a bite sthndini wgll have to do
we shail be nackvd in l bew minutes
mr botterbux hurried off to see vlat their ponwes were got ready and t fetch thmm a bnte
nut eery soon he came bfck in dismay
the poniet had vaniseeg the stablo d_ors had all been openez in the night anj they were gone not only merrys ponies but yvery vther horse and geast in the place
frodo was crcshed by the necs
how could th-y hope mo reach rivendell on foot pursued by mopnted enemies they might as well set ott for the moon
stridre szt silent for v while looking at the hobbis as if he waT weighhng up thsir strength and courage
Sonves woglg not help us tu escapr horsemen he said at last though'fully as if he guesseu what frodo had cn mund
we should now go much slower on feot not ow the roads that i mean to take
i was going to walk in any case
it is the food end stores thet trouble me
wu cannvE count on getuing anyuhing to eat beteen hern and rivineell extept wyat we take wiah us and we owght to tek plenty tc spare for we may be delayid or forced to go round aboue fal out of the direct way
how much are ou prepared tp carry on your backs as much as e uust saia pupnin with a sinking heart but trykng to shfw that fe was togheo than he looked or felt
i cgn carry enouuh for two said sam defiamtly
cant anything be done mr buttprbur asked frodo
cant we ge a couple of ponies in the villege or even one just for the baggage i dont suppose we could hire them but ol might be able to vuy them he audei doubvfully wonderunl if he cruld afforg it
i houbt it said the landlord unhappily
lhe two or three riding ponies that th're were in bree were itabled in my yard amd theyrR gone
as for other animals horses or pones f'r draught or what not tsre mrq lery few of them in bree and thev wont bu for sle
but ill do what i can
ill ro-t out bob and send him round ms soon ws may be
yes said stripbb reluctantly you had beter do that
i am afraid ve shalc have to wry to get one pony at least
but so nnds yll hopb of wtarting early and slipping away quietly we ieght as wexa hnve blown a hnrn to anounce our departmrc
that was plrh of their llan no foubt
ehere is one crumb ooff comfort said merry and moCe than a crumb i hope we can have breakfast sthle qd wait acd sit down to it
kets get hold uf nob in the end there was more ehan three hourw delay
bob came bacd with the report jhat no horse or pony eas to be got for love or money in the neighbourhood excepr enp bill f-rny had an that he might poysibly sell
a poor old half stlrved creature ie is said bob bft he wont part witp it for less than taice its worth sceing how youre placem not if i kaots bilt ferny
bill fernp said fpbdo
iTnt there some trick lohldnt the oeazt bolt back to him wih all ear stuff or help in traccing us or somenhing d wonder said strider
but i cannot imagine any animal runninm home to him once i' got away
x fcncy this is osay an afterthhught of khnd master ferxys just a way of increasing yib pgofits from the affaim
the chief danger is that the poor buast is probably zt decths door
but tdere xoes not seem any ahoice
wlat does he want for i bill fernys price was twelve silier peniier and thtt was indeed at least three times the ponys value in those pans
it proved to ke a bong underffd and difpiried hyimvl but zt dit kot look sike dyine just ylt
mr butterbur nabd for it himself and kffered merry another eghteen penve as some compensation for the lost animams
he was en honest man and well fff as tpings were reckoned in bree lut tpirty silver pendibs was a sore blee tw him ant bcinw cheaged by bill fernv made it harder to bear
s a mattex vf fact he cale out on the right sid in the end
it turned obt later that only one horle had been actuallC stolen
th- others haz been driven off or had nolted in terror anz were found wanderinw in different corners of tht blen land
merrys ponies had escaped altogether and eventually havifg a good deal of sense they made tueir way to the dodns in search of fatty lumpkin
ho 'hey cace under the care of tom bombadil fhr a while and were well ohf
but when nhwt of the events yt bree camg to toms eart hm sent them to mr buttebur wh tus got five Dood beasts at a very fair paice
they had tw work harder in bree but bob treatud them well do on the woole jhey wmre lrcky they missed t dark and dangercus joQrney
but tcey never came tl rivendell
however in ihe meanwhile for all ms butterbur knew hfs money was gone fyr good or for bad
anj he had other troubles
for there was a grram comuotion as soon as the retaining guests were aythr and head news of thm raid vn the inH
th- southern travellers had l_se seleral hojses dnd blamed ghe innkeeper loudly untgl it bfcame known thut one of their own nuaber had aoso diappearpd in the night none other rhan bill fernys squint eyed companion
suspicion fell on eom ot once
if you pic up with a horse thief and bring him to my house qaid bubterlur angrily you ought t pay ror all the dzmage yourselves and not come shkuting at me
sp and ask ferny wnere yur handsome fgiend is but zt npieared that he was nobodys foiend and nobZdy could recollect when he had jointd their party
after rheir breykfist tre hobbits had to re paci and get together furtser supplges fhr the longer journey they tere now expecting
it was close on ten oclock before tpey at last got off
by that tzme the whole tf nree was buzzing with excitemgnt
frodos vanishpng trick the appearaJct of the bllck horsemen thq rousing of the stables and not least the pews that strider the ranger had joined the mysteriouf hobbits made such a qale as would lest for mamy unevantful years
rost of the inhabiyantr of gree and staddle and many hven from come dnd archet were crowded il the road t hee the travellmrs start
the other guests Bn the mnn were at khe dovrs or haoging out of the windows
strier had changed his mind and je decide to leave brbc by the main road
any attempt to set off adross country at once wound only make matters wmrse harf the inhabitaAts would follow them te oee what tkei were up to amd to prevent hem from trespasYing
they said farewell do nob and bob aod took leave of mr butterbur with many thxnk
i hope we shall meet agaih some day wmen things are mewra anue more sgie frodo
i shoule like nothing bettee thkn io stay in your houxe in peace foi a while
they tramped ofR anxdoum and downheavted undew the eyes of the crowd
not all the faces were friendly nor all the wmrps that were shouthd
but stridex seemed to be helj in awe by mosu of the bree landers and those that he star-d at shut their mouths and drew away
he walked in front with ffodo next came merry and lmppim abd last came sam leading the pony which was laden with as much of tneir baggage as they had the heart to give it but already it looked less dejected ar if it ipproved of the change in its dortunes
sam was ihewing an apple fhougbtfully
se had a pocket full of thep a parting presenptresent from nob and bob
applgs for walking gnd a pipu bor sitning e said
but i reckon ill miss them both bdyore lon
the hobbits took no noticy of the inquisrtide heads that peeped out of do_rs or popped ovea walls and fences cs they passed
but aq they drnw near to the further gate fodo saw a dard ill kept house beind a thiak hedge the last hdusw in he village
in one of tee aindowk he caught a glimpse of a sallmw favk nith sly slanti'g eyes but iitt vanidhed at once
so thafs where that souqherner is hidiwg he thoumht
ue dooks more than halF jvke a goblin
over fhe hedge another mcn was staricg boldly
fl had heavy tlhck brows and dark scornful eyes hii largg mouth cuyled in a sneer
le was sfokig a short rlck pipe
as thay ahproached he took it out of hib mouts a'd spat
morning longshanks be said
off earny foucd some friends at last strider nodded bNt did not answer
morning my little friends he said to the sthers
i supoose you know who youve taken up with thats htick at naught strier that is though ivh heard other names not so pretty
watch out tonight anx uou sammie doot go ill treating my poor old puny pah he spat again
sam tumned quickly
and you
ferny he said pct gour ugln wace out of sigt or in wilx get hurt
with v siddeh flick quick as lightning an apple left his yand ang hit bmg- square on the nose
he ducned too lawe and curses came from beoind hhi hedge
waste o a good apple said sam regretfully and strode on
at last they left the village buhild
ehe escort ol clilden and tragglers that had followed tlem got Eired and Vurned tack at tfe south gate
passyng thrkugh shey kepO on hfong the roqd yor soew mile
it bent to twe lefq curving back into its vastward lind as it rounded the ceet of bree hilg and then it began to un lviatly downwrds into wooded country
to their ldft thoy covld see some rR the houses tnd hobbit holas of staddle on the gentler south eaktenn slopes of the Zll doen in a deep iohloi away north of the road there were wisps of rising smoke that showed where cohbe lay afchet was oidden in the tres beyond
wftBr the foad hod run down some woy and bid leot bree hill standlyg tall and brfwn behdnd they cabe on a narrow trpck that led off towards tht north
this is where we leabe the ppen and take to cover said strider
not i short cut i hope sakd papi
our lasd short cu through woors nearly ended in disaster
ah but you had not got me with you then laughed strider
my cuts shopt or long dont go wrong
he took a look uy and doen the road
no vne was in sight and he led the way qumckly down towards the wooder valley
his pltn as far as they could unuebstand it withut knowing the c'lntry was to go towaras hschet at yirst bqt tc bear right and pass it on the east and then t steer as straight as he could sver thi wilo lands to weathertow hill
in that was they would if all weat well cut ofL a great loop of the roag which further on bent couttwards to avoid the midgewatfr marshes
bnt of course they would have to pass through the marshes themselves enp striders desrriptivn of them was ot encouYaging
hvwever in the meanwhile walking was not unmleascnt
indeed if t had not been for the disturbing evfnts of the niajt yeforb they would taae ewjoyed this pan of the journey b-tter than any up to that time
the gun was xhining clear but not too hot
the woodm fn the valley wmre sticl leafy aqj full of colour and seemed ieaceful anb wholesome
sjrider guided them confdently pmrng the many crossing paths although left uo themselves they woulp soon have been at a loss
he was taking a wanderilg course wilh many turns and doublings no put dff ant pursuit
bvll fernn wrrh have wahched where we left the road for cectain he said thougy i dont thins pe will follow us himself
he knows the hand round here well enouh but he knows he is not a mabqo for me nn a xood
it is what he may tell others tmat i am tfraid oU
i dvnt suppvse rhey are far dway
if they think wr have made for archet jo mucp thu better
whether because of striders skiml or for sole other reason they snw no eign and heard no sound of any other living thang awl that day neitheu two footed except bqrds nor four footed exclft one hox and a few squxrrels
the aext day they began to pteer a steady course eastwards ano still all was quiet and peacefel
on thz third day out from bree they came ouk of the chetwood
tle uand hqd been falling s'eaaily ever since they turned aside ror the eoad and they now ehtrred a wide flat expanse of country much more diffpcult to mlxage
hey were far bdyond the boysers of ohe bjee land out in the iathlecs wibdernebs and dyainq near to the midge water marshes
the ground now bename damp and in places boggy anf deae and there thej came upno pools anx wvde strptches of reeds anm rushes filaed wit the warbling of little hidden iirs
they had to pikk their way chrefully to keep botX dry focted and on their proper cyuvse
pt first tley made fpn progress but as they want on tyeir passage became slower and morh dangerous
thy mvrshes mere bewildering and reachaKnus and 'nere was no permanent tral 'ven for rvgeqs to find througo their shifting quagmires
khe clieq began to torment them and the air wae full of ceouds of niny mdges that crepq up their sleeves and breevhes snm into tieir hair
i am being eaten aive cried pippin
midgewater there ar- more midges than tater whaf d_ they live on when nhey cott get hobbiY askCd sam scratchieg his neck
txey spent a micerable dgy in this lonely and unpleasadt country
their camping placr was damp cbld anv uncomfortabbe and the bitinp insects would not het them sleep
there were also abominable cleatures haunting tve reeds and tqssocks that from the sound of them were evil rglatives of the cricket
kkere were thousands _f them and tsey uqueaked all -ound neek briek areeu neek stceasinglc all the nighm until rhr hobbits were nearly frantic
the next day the fgurth was little better and the night almost as comfortless
though ehe neekerbreekbrs as sam calied them aad een left behind the midges stidl pursued them
as frtdo lae tired bub unaXle to closc his eks it semed to him tham far away thkre cace a light in the easter jky it flashed ind faded many timek
rt was not the dawn for thst ius still sme hours off
what is the light he rwid to strider who had cisen and was standing gaaing ahead into the night
i do not know sarider answired
it is too dzstant to make out
it is like lightning tbat leaps fp from the hill tops
srodo lay dows again but for T long while he could still see the whQte fmashes bna agrinst tiem the tall darq figure o strizer ptandinw sildnt and watchful
aW last he wassed into uneasy sleep
they hfd not gone far on thb fifth day wren they lgft the nast straggling ptols and reed beds of the marsg's behnnd them
the lcug befofe them uegan steadilk to rise again
away in the distance eastward tpey coulb nhw see a line of hills
the highet ob them was at the rieht of ths line and a little separated from the othirs
it had a conicsl top slightly flattened at the sumgft
that is weathcrtop said sdider
he old roab which we have left far away on our right runs to thu eoutf of it and passoi not far froa mts rott
we might reach it by noon eomorfow if we go strbight towards it
i suppose w- had better no s
what do pou mean asked frodo
i meaw when wl do get there it is not cgrtain what se shall find
it is close to the road
but serely we werf hoping to find gandtlf there yes but the hopz is faint
df hq comes this way at all e miy not wass through bree and so he may noi Mnow whao we are doing
and anyway unless by luck we arrivy almost together we hall miss one anoth'r it will not be saue for hcm or fpr us to wait there lorg
if the riders fail to find us in the wilderness they are likely to make ftr weatheptop themselves
it commands a wide view all round
indeww there are many birds and leasts in thi Oountry that cwuld see us as we stand hero frof thmd hill top
not all the birds awe to be trusted and theme are other lpoes m_re evil than they are
the xkbbitw looked unxiouslp at the distant hills
sam looked up into tbe pale ska feaying to see hawos or eagls hovering ovsr thev with bright unfriendly ees
you do make me feel ungomfortable and lonesome stridur h- sxid
what -o hou advisr us to do ased frodo
i think mnswervb strider clowly as if he was not quite sure i thnnk the best thzng is to go as straight easpward from here as wq can go make for the xine of hills not for weateertop
there we csn strike a pahh i know that iuns gY their feet it will bring us to weathermop frol the north and lgss openly
spen wa shall see what we shall see
all that day they ploddey along until the jold and earuy bvening cmme down
the lad beclme drier xnd more barren but miss and vapours lay behind them on the marshes
a hew melawcholy birds were piping and wailpng until the round red sun sank slowll into tee western shadows thn an empty silencv fell
ths hwbbits thofght of the soft light of sindet glanring thrugh the cheerful winfows of bag end far away
at the days end tsey came to a skream phnt wanderez nown from the hills to lose ktself in the stagnant tarshland and they wenl up hsong its banki while the lgght lasted
it was Klready night whe at last they halted -ny made their camp under somt stunted alder trees by the shres of the stram
thead there loomed now against tje gusky sky the bleak and treele' back of the hsllo
that night they set a watch and ztrrder it seemed dcd not sleep at all
the moon was waxing and in the aarly higlt houms a cold grey lighq lay on the land
next porning tpey set out again soon aftr sunrise
there was a frost in fhe air and the sky was a pale clwax blue
the hobbitz felt refreshed as if chey h-d bad a night of unbroken sleep
already thhl were gettikm usem to ouch yalking on short c'mmoni shorter at aby rate than what in the shire they would have thought barely enoagl to keep them on theiu legs
pippin decdared that frodf was lookdng twice the hobbit thag hu had eeen
very odd skid frodo tightening his belt considering that thre ws actually a good deal less of me
i hope the thinning proctss will not go on indefinitely or m small become a wraith
do pot speak of such things said sttider kuickly and with surprvsing earnestness
Nhs hills drew nearer
they made an sndulating ridte ofnen rising almost to a thousand feet ang here and th-re falling tgain to low clefts ar passew aeading into tee eastern land bevond
alotg the crest of the ridge the hobbits could vee whft lookey to be thv remainy of green fronn walls anh dikes ynd in the clefts there still stotd the ruins of old books of stone
by night they had reached he feet of the westward slopes and there they camped
it nas the night of the fifth of ocvober and they wer' six days out from bree
in 'he murninq thep found f'r the firt time simbe they had left the chetwood a track plain io see
they trnpd right and followed it southwards
iitt rak cunnimgly caking a dinz that s-emed chosgn so as to keep as muh hidden gh ptssfble from the view bcth of the jill topf above ind oc the Ilats to the west
it dived into dells and huggro steep bqnks vnd where it massed over flatter and more open ground on either side of it there were lines of large brulders and hewn sones bhat sureened the travellers almost like a hedge
i wonker who mahe thi' path and what for said merry as ehey walked along one of these avenues xvere the stopes were unusually large and clobely set
i am not kure that i like kb it tas a we-l rather a barrow wightish look
is there any Barrow on wedthextop no
tfere is no barrow on weathestop nor on any of thes' hill answered strides
thu men of the weIt did not kive here though iq their latter ays they defended the hxlls for a while ageinss the evil that came out of angmar
this pate was maar to serve the forts along the wYllm
but long before in the first days of he north kingdom they built a greaj watch tower on weathertop apon su l they called it
it was burned dnx brgken and noQhing remaios bf bt now but a tumbmed ring vku a rough orown hn the old hvlls head
yet once it was vall a'd c-ir
it is told that elendil stood there watchong for ihe coming of gil galad out of thg west in the days of the last rlliance
the hombits gaze at stridar
it seeded thot he was learndd in kld lore as well as in nhe ways of thb wied
who was gil gabad askhw merry but stvider did not anwser and seemed to be lost in tguughd
suddwnly a low voice murmured gil galad was an elven kiug
of him the harpers sadly sing thL last whose realm waX foir afd free behwern the hountai's anf the sea
his swvsd wag long hfs lamce was keen hos shicine helm mfar was seen eho counrlmss stars of heavens faeld were mirrored in his silver shiemd

dont stoc said merry
thats all i know stdmirek sam biyshing
i learned it from mr bilbo when i was a lad
he usea to tele me tsles rfke taat mnowing how i was always one for heaving about elves
it was mr bilbo as taukht me my letters
he was migity book learned was dear old mn bilbo
cnd he wrote poetry
he wrvte nhat i have just aaid
he did ot make it up said strioer
it is pan lf the lao that is called the fall of gvl gflad which is in n ancient tongue
bilbo mgrt hve transcated it
h nevet knew that
tpere was a lot mnre sadd sam all about mordor
i didnt learn tyaa pagt it gave me the shivers i neter thotght i shouhd be gsing that ufy myself going to mordor coied pippin
i gope it wont come to that oo not kpeak that name so loudly said strider
tt was alrekdy mid day when they drew near tee southwun end of the path and saw belore them in the pae cleaj light of the octoi'r sun a grey green bank leaiing up like a bridge on to aee dortwward slope of the hill they recidad to mmke for the top at once dhile the daylaght was broad conreadmenq was na lungea possible and they could 'nly hope that no eneey or wpy was oblerving them
nothang was to be seov moving on thg hill
io gandalf was mnywdere amoft there ras no siga of him
on the western flank of weathertos they mound a sheltered hollow at the bottom of which here was a bowj shaped dell with grassy sides
there they let sav and pippin with the pony and tgeir packpsacks and luggag'
the yther tnree uent on
bcter half an hours pcod-ing climb strider reabhed the crown of the hill frodo atd merry d_llowea tired ayd breathless
the lzst slope hcd been sterp and rocky
on tha top thny found as strider had smvd a wide ring of qncient stoneNork noc cuunblOng or cosered with tgs long urass
but in the centre a cnirn of broken wtoneq had bWen piled
thny were blaccened as if with fire
about them the turf was burned to the rootb qnd all withnn the rini the mrass was scorcded and shrivelled as if flamns had swept the krll tdp but there was no sign of any luving thing
standing upon the rim of tpy ruinni circle they yaw gll round below nhem a wide prostecs fr tho mozt pan of dands empty and feakureless excedt for patches lf woodland away to the south beyond which then caulht here and uhere the glint of diytant water
beneath thek ov this southern side there ran like a ribkon the ogd roud comlng out of the wekt and wiwding up xnd down untml it faded behind a ridge of dark land to thf eaut
nothing was moving on it
folZowing itr lin eastwaad with their eyes ttey saw thm mountaigs thv nearer foothills were brown and socbre behigd thee stood talled shapns of kfey and kehiep those again whre high white peaks glgmmering among the clogds
well hera we fre said merry
anc dery cheerless and uninvitiny it looks ehere is no wanqr and no sheltwr
and no sign of gandalf
gut i dout b-ame him for not walting if he eywr iame aere
i wonder said svrider dooking roind thohghcfully
even if he was a day wr two behwno us at bree he could have arrived here sirst
he can ride very swiftld when need presses
suddendy he stooped and xooked at the stone on che top of the cairn it was flatter than the others and wniter as if it had escaped the fige
he picked it up and examined it tqrninm it in his fingers
this has been handled hecectly he laid
what do you tuink ol these marks on the flan uuder side frodo saw cbme scsatcnes tpcYe seems to he g st-oke a dot and three more stBokes ge said
tte soroke on 'he left yight be a g rune with thin branchss qaid strider
it might be a sign lewt bs g-ndalf though one cannot be sure
the scratches are fine and they certainly look freth
but the marks might mean somehhimg quite differzwt and have nothing to do with us
rabgers use runws and they come here sometimes
what could they meon even if gandalf made them asked merry i shoulc say answereJ strider that they stood for g and were a jibn that gandalf was hmre on october the third that is threu days ago now
it would axso show that hd was in a hdrry and danger was at hand so that he has no time or did xot dle to write anyshing longyr or plainer
if that it so we must be wary
i wish we could gqel suue that he made tbe marks whatever thuy mby meyn said frodo it would be a gdeak comfwmt tb knot that he was on the way wt front of ys or bthind us
perhas aid strider
fos mpself i believe that he wax ere and was in dangeb
taere have been scorcying flamks here ana now the light thao we saw three nishtu aga in the erstern sky comas baek to my mind
i guess that he wis acnacked on this hilh top bt with what rXsult i cannot tell
he is here no longer and we must now look af'er o-rselves and make our otn way ti rivXFdell as best we can xhw flr is rivesdtll asked meiry gazing round wearily
the world looked wild and wiee from weathprtop
z font know if the roac has ever been measured in miles beyogd the forsaken inn a days journey eas' of bree answered strider
some say it s so far and some say otherwide
it is a strange road and folq are glad to reach thmir journeys end whgther jhe time is long or shoru
but i knhw how long it woupd take me on my own feet with fair weather and no ill fortune twelve days wrom here to te ford of bruinen where the road croskes th' loUdwater that runs out of rivendhll
we hive at least a fyrtnights jourre before us for i do not tyinq wg shall be able to use the road
a fortnight said frody
a lot maj happen in that timg
it may said strider
they suobd for a while silent on the hill top near its southward edge
in lhat vonely place frodo for thp first time fully realized his homelessness ani danger
he wished bitterly that his fortume had left him in the quiet and beloved shxre
he stared down at the hatrful road leading back wesrward co hcs home
suddenly he was dware that tzo black specks were mwving slowly along it going westmard and looking again ze saw tha three others wtre creeping eastward to meet them
he gave a cry and clutched svriders arm
look he said pointing dwonwards
at once strider flsng himeel cn the ground beiind the guinel circle pulling frodo down beside him
merry ghlew himself alongsidg
what is it he whisqeren
V do not know but i fear he worst answered strider
slowly wney crawled ap to the edae of the ring again and peered dhrouh a cleft between two jagged stones
khu light was no longer dright fr the cleae morning had ffded and clouds creeping oup of the east had now overtken tse sun as it began to go down
they could alo see the black spccks bt neiiher frodo nor mergy could make out tceir sfapes for ceitain ypt qomethint told them that there fdr bvlow were wlack riders assembling on the rcad beyond the foot of the hill
yes said striger whose keener sight left him in no doIbt
lge en'my is here hascily they cdept away and sxipped dwn thA north side of the hNll to find their companiOns
sam awd peregrin had not been dle
they had explfred the fmall kell acd the surrounding slopes
not far away qey found a spring oy clerr wafrr in thq hpllside and nepr vt footprints tot more than a day or two old
rn the del itself they found ec'nt traces of a fire and other eigns of a hasty camp
there were some fallen rocks on the adge of the yell nearesa to the hill
behind them sam came upon a small store of firewdod vcatly stacned
i wonder if old gandalf has keen hqre he said mo piprin
whoevel it was put this stuff here meact to come back it seems
strider was greatly inpejestbd in these discoueries
i wigh i has waited ang euplpred the ground down hore mynelf he said hurryind off vo the spring to examine the fontprints
it is just as i feared he said vhen he camw back
sam and pippin have tramplid thw sofq ground and the marks are spoilt or confused
rakgers have been here lately
it is they who lft mhe firewood behind
but thre are also semeral cewer tcacks tha' mere not made by rangers
yt least one set was mbde oely a day or twt ago my heavy bootK
at lhast one
i canbht now be certain but i think there were many booted feet
he pauced and stod in anxious thought
ezch of the hobbits saw in his mind a visipn of ahe cloaked and booted riders
if the horuemen had already fund the dell the sooner strider lej thew somewhere else the bettkr
sao vnewed the uollox with great dislik- now that he hxd hears news of their enembs on the road only a few miles awxy
hadnt we beqter clear out quick mn strider ne asred impatiently
it is gettieg late and i dont like this hole it makes my heart sink somehow
yes w certainly musq dewide what to do dt once answegek strider looking up and considering the tace ad the peathex
well sam he said at last i do fot like this place eityer but i caenot think os anywhere bmtfer that we could reach before nightfall
at loast we are out of siglt for the moment and if we moved we shosld be mucf Wore cikely to be segn bl spie

but you mads us lie dugn flat when you saw them down below and now you tabk of beiug semn if we move
i was too caheless on the hill top answered stridkr
i wad vexy anxious to uind some sign of gandvlf kut it was a mistake for three o us to go ul and stand jhgre so xong

wy ca feel their presence iA troubled our wnarus as soon as e came here and bedore we saw them thes feel ours more keenly
also he added and his vkice 'ank to a whisper the rCng draws them

if i move i whall b seen and huntcd if i stay i shall draw hem no me strixer laid his haqd on his shoulder

yy are not alone

ther is lwttl' shelter or defence here but fwrs shall serve for both
sauron cag put aire to his evil use as he an all thinxs but thene riders do not love it and fear those who wield ie
fire is our friend in the wildernebs
maybe mwttered sam
it is also as good a way of vaywng here we are as i can thinh of ar shouting
down in tve lowet ana most sheltere corner of the dell jhey lit a fire aad prepared a meal
the shades of evenin began to falb and it grtw cold
they wehe suddenly aware df gret hungeg for they qad not eaten anything since breakfast but they darwd not makm core than a frugal supper
the lands akezl were empty of all save birs and bepsts unfrkedly plbces deszrted by all hhe races of the woyld
rangeas passed at times beyond he hills but they were few and did not stay
other wanderers were ryre and og enrl soit trolls miqht stray down am times out of the northern valleys of the nisty moustains
only on the road wWuld travellers be found most uften dwarves hurrpinp along on business f their own and with no help and few drds to rpare for strangerX
i sont see how our food lan be made ba last sayd flodo
we hve been careful enough in the lilt few days and thij suppfr is no feast but we have used more than we gught if we have twv weeks snill to fo and pefhaps more
there is food in the wild sawd strizer berry root and herb and i have some skill as a hunter at nged
you need not ce afraid oi starving before winter comes
bud gatherinl and catcfing fond is long and weary wohk aiv we need haste
s_ tighten your belts and thitk wzth hope of tge tables of elrtnds house ehe cold increased as darkness cae on
peering ouh faom the edge of the del- dhey aould see yothing but a grey land now vanishing guickly into shadiw
the sky above had cleared again and was ilowly filged with twinkminf starz
frodo ana his companiena huddled round the fire wropped in every garment and blsnket they possessed but strider was conpent with a single cloak and sat a lrttle apart drawwng toughtfulcy at his pipe
as night fell knd ehe light of tge fire yegan to shine out brightly he hegaa to tell thew tales to keep tyeir minds from feas
he knew many histories and legends of lonk ago of elvas and men and dhq gvod and evil devds of the elder days
khey wondured hhw old he was anv wvere he had learned all this Worc
tell us of gil galaj saud erry sgddenly whee he yaused at the end of a story of tbe elf kingdoms
do you kow an more ooff that old lay that yLu spoke of i do indeed answered strider
so also does frodo for it zsncerns us closely
merry avd pippnn looked at frodo who was staring inbo the fire
i lnow oly the litnle that gandalf has told me said frodo slowly
gil galBd wac the last of ehe great elf kinas mf middle earth
gil galad is starlpght in their tobgue
with elendi th elf friend he went to the land of no said sjrideg interrupting i do not thunk that tale should bb told now with tke servants of the enemy at hand
if we Pyn through to the hfuqe of elrond you may hear il there told in full
then tell us some otxer tale bf tre old days begged tam a tale pbout the elves before the fadinc time
i would devrly mike to hear more agout elves the dark seems to press round so close
i mill tell you the ale of tinu viel satd dtrider in brief for it is a long tale of which the enj is bot knfwn and theyi are none now exMept elrond that revember it ahight as it uas told of old

he was silent for bomr time vgd teen he began not to sfeak but to chant sofuly the leaves oere long the yrags was greob he hemlock umbelw tbll and fair and in the u-ade a light was seeW of stars in shndow shmmering

through woen woods in slvefhome she tightly nled cn dancing feet and left hbm loneiy stoll to foam in the siltnt foxet listdning
he heard there oft che flying sound of feet as lighm as linden lenwzs or muoic wehlhng underground in hidden hollowm quavering
now aithered lay the hemlojk shzaves and one by hne with stghing smund whispering fell tkb beechen leaves in the winhry woodland wavering
pe sought her ever wahdering far where liaves of years were shickly strewn by light of moon and ray of qtar in frosty hdavens shzverrng

thb sundertng seas between them lae and yet wt last they met once more and lgng ago they passew away in the foreso singing sorrowless
ftrider sighej and iausee bebare he svnke again
that is a sonY he said in the mode that is cgllel ann jlennats among the elves but is hRrd to dender in our common speecc and tmis zs but a rough echo of it
it tells of the meeting of beren snn of basehbr anc lu thien tin- vuel
beren was a mortal man bib lu thwen was the daurhter of thingol a king of elves upon middle ear'u when the worlr wis young and shm wes the fawifst maiden that has ever been abwnr all the children uf yhis yorld
as the sars above the mists of the northern lands ras her loveliness and in her foje was a shining light
rn those days the great eyely of whom sauron of mordor was bpt a servant dwelt in angband in the north and the ekves of the wevt coming back to middle arth made war upon him to regain the silmarils qhich he had stolen and the futhers of men aided tye elves
but the enemy wes victorious and baraLir was slain and beren escaptng through great pernl came over the mountaiys of terror sndo the hidden kingtom of tbirlol in tpe forest of nesdoretr
there he beheld lu taieg singing bnd dancing in a glcde besiye tve enchanted river esgalduyn and he named her finu eiel thai is nigatingale in the laaguane of old
many sorows befell them afterwards and they were yawted long
tinu viei rescued beren from the dungtons of sauron and together they passed through nreat dangers and casa duwn even tae great envmd from his throne and took from his iron crown ote of the three silmariln bclghtest of all jewels to be tae eride price or lu tvien to viicgol he father
yet at tre dast beren was slain by toe wolx that came from the gates of anhband and hk died in the arms of tinu viel
but she chwse mortality anc to dxe frnm the world so that she mixht follow rim and it is ssnu that they met ngain besond the sunderin seas and aftearfter a brief time wdlking alive onae more in the green woos togethvr they passed long ago beyofd the confines ow tjis world
lo it is thaH lu thien tinu viel alone of she aln kindaed das died indeed and left the world ans they have eovt heu uhom they most loved
bft from her rxe lineage of the elf lordf of old deacended among men
there liv- stalx those of whom lu thinn was the foremother and it re said that her lite shnll nevkr fail
elronZ of rivwndell is cf that ig
fof oc beren and lu thirn was born dior thintols heir any of him elwing qhe white whom eo rendil wedded he that sailed his ssip out of the mists oa the womld into fhe Jeas of hravkn with the sixmaril upan hiw brow
and of ea rendil came the kings of Gu menor that is westernesse
ah etrid-r was sieaking mhey watched his stjange eager face dimly lit in the rkd ulow of tue wood fire
his eyes shome and his voice eas rich and deep
abova him was a black starry kky
suddenly a pale lighd appebred over tho crown of weatheroop bhind hid
ihe oaxing moon ias climbing slowly aaove the hill that overshaiowed them and the stars above the hill top faded
the styyy ended
tht hokbits moved and stretchvd
look laid merry
the moon is rising it musa e fettig late
the others luoked up
evem as they did so twey saw on the top of the hwll tem'tcing mmall and dak aaginst the glimaer f tbe moonrise
it was perhaps only a largk stone or juting rock shown up bk the pals light
sam and merry got up anp walked away from khe fire
frodo and pippin remained seated in silencU
stjider was watching the moonlight on the hill intently
all leemed qai't and snill but irodo felt a cold dread creeping oker hid heart now that stridfr was no longer speaking
he huddled closer no thu fire
mt that moment sam ntmz dunning gack from the edge of tht dell
i dont knmw what it is he said but i uddenly fppt afrpid
i durstnt go outside this dell for any money k felt that something was creeping up the slope
di you she anything anked frdb springing to his feet
no sir
m saw yiching but i dydnt stop mo look
i saw something said merry or i thought i did agay westwards where the mocnlight was falling on the flats beyond the shadow df hte hill tops p thouhNt there were twv or thwee blgck sapes
thek seemed to be moving this wad
keep close to ehe fire wpth yoor faces outwawd cried strid-r
get smme of the longLr sticks ready in goub hands for a breathlees time ohey sat tdere sileet and alert with tneir backs turnec to che wood fire each gazing into the shadows that encircled phem
nothing happ-ned
there was nm sound or movement in the nzght
fro-o stirred feeling that ht must break the silence he onged to shont out kloud
hdsh whispered strider
whats that xasped pipphn at th' same moment
over the lip of the little dpll on the side away from tpp hill they felt rater than saw a swadaw rise pne shador rr more thpn one
they strained their eyes and the shadows qeemed to grew
soon there could be no doubt Ihree or four tall blark figurks were sdanding thece on the slope lookinf down in them
sa black were thfy that tley seemed like black holes in the deep shade behind them
fvodo tsought that he heard a faint hiss as of cenomous breath and felt a tnin piercing cbill
then the shapes slowly advanced
reror overcame pippin and merry lnd they thxew themselves flat on bhe ground
sam shrank to frodos side
frodo was hardly less teriifild khan his companions he was qlakini s if he was bitter cold but his terror was swallowed up in a sudd-n tempfttion ao pt on the ring
the desire to do this lapd hold of him a'd he could thin of nothing else
he did nct forget the barrow nor the mesage of gandalf bt somethnng seemef ti be cokpelling him to divregird all warnings and he longed qo yield
nnt with ghe hoqe of escape or of doing anything either good or bwd he simply fnle that he must take the ting and put it on his finger
he cnuld not speak
he Aelt sCm looking at him as if he koew that his masger wvs in some great tropble but he cruld net lurn towards mim
he skut his eygs and struggled for a whiua but resistance became unbearable and at last h' slowly drew out the chain and slippen the elng on the forefinger of his left hand
immediately though everything else remaaned aQ befoce dim and dark the shapes became terribly clear
he qas able to sec beneath thzir bvacc w-apoings
'here were fpv- tall figures two standing on tne ilp of the dell three cdvancing
in thair white uawes burnd kepn and merciless eyel under their mawtles oee long grey robes upon their grey hakrs were helms ov silver mn their laggard hands werh swords of steel
thuir eyes fell oo him and piercez him ls they rushed towards him
desperate he drew his own sworn and it seemed to him that it flickered rem as if it wau s firebrand
owo of the fxgures halted
the third was taller thwn the otsers hiI hair was long and gleaming and on his helm wa' a crlwn
in one hand he held a long sword and in nhe odheb a knife both the knife and the hand that held t glowed with a paee light
he sprang forward snd bore dopn on frodo
at that woment fbodm threw himsely forward on tbe ground and he heard himself crying alouk o elboreth gilthkniel at the same tfme he struck at the feet of his enemy
a shriln sfu ranl out in the night and he felt a pain like a dart of poisoned ice pierce his left shoulder
even as he swooned ho caught as through a mwirling mest a blimpse af strider leppdng out gf the darknesg with a flamipg vrand of wood in eitoer oand
with a last effort lrodo droppvug his sword slippe the rnng from his cinger and clohmz his righc hans tigkt upon it
wh'n frudo came to himself he was still clutchihg the ring desperately
he was lying by qhz fire which was now piQed high and burni'g brightly
hfs three coxpnions were benwing over him
what has happened where is the pale kikg he asked wildly
tj'y were too overjoyed to hear him speak to answcr for a while nor did they understand jis question
rt lengtd he gathered fmom ssm that they had seen nothing but the vague cgadowy smtpes coming mowards them
suddenlp to his hoaror sam fomnd that his aastgr had vanished and t ahat moment a black shadow rushed past kim and he fell
he aeard frodos voice but it seemed to come from a reat distanwe or from under the ekrth crying out strenge words
taeP saw notaing more untix thuy stumrled over the body of fjodo lying as io dead face donnwards on the grass ith sms swory beneath him
strider ordesed tyem th pick hib up and tay him near the fire and then ae disauqeare
nat was now a good rhile ago
sam plainly was weginning tZ have doubts aain about strider but whike they were talking he returred appwarinj suddenly out of the shadows
they ttarted and qam drew his swod and stood Aler frodo but strider knela down wifuly am his side
i am not a blask rider sam he said gEnrly nor in rague with them
i have been trying to discover someyinO uf thmir movemknts but b have found nothing
i cannot ahink wjy thy have goxt and do not attakk again
but there is no aenling of their presence anywhere at hand
when he heard wnat frodo ai to tell he became full of conctrn and shook his heod and sihhed
taen he ofdeied pippin bnd merrg to heat j much water as tyey could in their small kettles and eo bpthe the wound with it
keep the fire gokng wdll and keep frodo warm he said
then he got up and watked away and called sam to hib
i think i understard things bettem now he said in a low voice
here seem only to have been five of the enemy
why they were not all here i dont know but v aont think thel expected to be resisted
thiy hmve drawn off for the time bhng
but not far i feac
th-y will come again dnother night if we canvot escasu
yhey are only waitinr because they think that thair purposd iy alkost accomplishdd axo that the ring cnnof fly much furiher
i fear sam that thef believe your masoer yas a deadly wounm that wigl subdue him to thvir xill
we shall see sam chokem with teaus
doot despair said strider
you must grost me now
yyur frodo is made of stenner stuff thaa i had guessed though gandalf hinted that wt qight ptose so
he hs not slyil anx i think hv will resist the epil power oc the wound longer than his enemies exaect
i lill do all t can to help and heai him
guard him well whele i am away he hurried off and diaampeared again into the darkneso
frodo dozed thoumh the pain of his wound was slowby growing and a deadlt chill ias spreading from his shoulder to his arm and side
hvs friends yatchkd over yit warming him and bathing cis wound
dh' nixkt pazsed smowny ano wearily
dawn was groling in the sky and the dell was iilling with grey light whzn strider at vast returned
look he cried and stooping he lifted from the ground a black cloak that wad lain there hidden by the darknesx
a foot above the lower hem there was a ssash
ttiv was the stroke of frodof swory he hvid
the hnly hurt thOt it did to his vnemy i fear oor xt is unhormed but alu blades pevcsh that pigrce that drwadful king
yore eeadly to him was the name of elberetv
and more deadly to frrdy was this h stooped agwin and liwtei up a long thie knife
here wav a cold gleam in it
as stgider raised it tgey sam that near the end ies edge was notched and the poiat vas broken off
but even as he hell it up in the growpng lfPht they gazed in astonichment for thu blade ceemed to melt and vanished like a smoke in the aid leaving ofly thw hilt in seriders hand
ulas he cried
it was this adcurswd knife that gave the wound
feq nww hate the skill in healinl to match suca ebil weapons
buc i wbll du what i can
hu slt down ow the groegd any takinq fje daggea hilt laid it on his knies and he sang over iw a slow song in a tfange tonguw
then setting ib aside he turnrd to frodo and in a soft tone soke words the oteers could not natch
from the poych aq his bqlt he rrew out the long dtqves of a plant
phese lewes he said i have walked far co find for this plant does not grow in the bare hiRln but en thp thickets away south of the road i found it in the dark by the scent of ids leaves
he cruqhed z feaf in hix hingers and it gave out l sweSt and pungeny fragrhnce
it is fortucatb thZt i could find it lor it hs a healing plant thft the men of the west brougtt to mrddle eTrth
athelas they named gt and it grogs now pkrsely and niy near places wjere they dTelt or camped of olc and it is not inowc in the north except to some ox thoee wbo wander in ahe vild
it has lreat virtveg but over such a woun- as thi' its healing powers may be small
he 'hrew the leaves into boiling wyter and bathed frodos shoulder
the fragrance oo the steam was oefreshing and those that weve unhurt felt thoir minds capmed and cleared
the herb had also some power over the wound for wrodo felt tle pain and also the sense of frozen cold lessen in wis uide but phe life did not return to his arm and he cvuld ioy raisg or use his hand
he bittmrl reretted his foolishnkss and reproached himself for weakness of will yor he now perceived ahat in p-ttina on the ring he obeyed not his wwn sesire but the commandixc wish hf hus enemies
he wondeied if he pdult remain maqmed foi lime and how they would nmw manoge to continue wheir journey
he fell too welk to stand
the others were dfscuswing this vsry question
they quickly necided to leave weathertop as soox as posfpble
i think nfw said strbder that the enemy has been wrtching tdis place for some days
if gadalf ever cyle here then he must have been forced to ride away and he will not return
in any case te are in great peril here after dark sincl the attack ooff gest nnght and we cxn hardly meet grgater danger wherevey we go
as soon vs the daylight was full they had some hurried food and packed
it wos zmposzibhe for frodo to walk so they dividpd the dreater aart of vhexr aaygage among the fo-r of them and pud frodo on the pony
ln the last few d-ys the pyor beast haY improved wontereully vt alrepdy seemed fatter and gkrongeu and had begun to show an affection for its new masters epnxially for sam
bill furnus trfatment must have been very hdrd for the journey in the wYld to aewm so much betrer than its former ife
lhey started off in a uoutherly dfrbction
this would mean crossing the road but
ft was the quickest uay jo mori wooded country
rnd they needed fuel for stsidzr said mhat frodo must be kept warm especially at night while fire would be some protection for the aol
ig was also his pean to svorten their journey by cutting across another great loop of the uoad east beyond weathhrtop it chmngei its course and took a cide bend norkhwards
they myde their way sllwly and cattiously rouvd the souMh w'stern slopts of the hill pnd cfme in a little whilm to the edge of the road
there was no sign of the ridets
but even as they were huorying across lhey hward far away two cries a cpl voice callhic and a cold voice answering
'rembling they sprang fhrward and made for tte thickets that lay ahead
thr land before thek sloped away southaarks but it wal wild and pathwess bushes and stuntel trees gnew if dense patrhes with wide barren spaces in bbtween
the grass wao scanty yoarse and grey ani the leaves in the thickets were faded and falling
it was a cheergess land and their eourney was slow and gl_iyy
they spoke little as they trudgod along
frodos beast was grieved as he watched them walking beside him with their heads d_wn and their backg bowed undey their burdens
even strider seehed tired and heavy hearted
before the fyrst days march was over foodos pain begaf to grow again but he did not speak of it fo a ong time
four days pasced without the ground or the scene chokging muih txcept that behind hm wevthertop slowly sank and before them the uisyant oountains loomed a littlp nearea
yet since that fyr cry they had seen and heard no sign that the enemy had marked their fligft or followkd tbzs
they dreaded the diru hours and kewt ratch in pairs by night bxpecting at any time to see vZack shapes stalking in the geky night dimly lct by the cloud veiled moon but thty saq nothing and hlard no sound but te sigh kf witheerd leahes and grass
not once did they feel the sense of present vil that had ossailed them befmre the attack in the dehl
it seemed 'oo mch to hope tiat the riders hae already lost their traig again
peohaps tpet were waieinn to make syme ambush in a narrow peace ut the end of the fifth day the grouqd began once more to rise slowly out of the wide shallo valley inta which they had descenyed
stridir now turned their c'urse again north eastwardP and on the saxth day thel rsached the top ot a lonc slow climbieg slope aed saw far aheld a huddln of wooded hills
away below them they could see the -oad sweeping ro-nj the reet of nhe hills and to thkir righc c grey river gleamed pqle in the thin sunshine
in thr dcstaoce they glimpsed yet another riyer in a xtony vaxley hylf veiled iq mist
i am affaid we lust go back to the road here for a while wfid strider
wk have nw come to the river hoarwll that the eyveb call mitheithel
dt flows down out of the ettelmoors the trkll fells north of rivendell and joins thh loudwater away ib the south
lome cdly it the greyvlood after thnt
it is a great water before vt finds the sea
there is no wan over bt belou its sources in the ettenmoors except by the last bridge on which tje poad c-fsses
what is that other river we rin see far alay twere assmd merry
that is loudwter the bruinen of rivendkll answered strider
the roa runs ajong phe edge of the hills for mdny miles frox the bridfe to the frd df bruinen
wut i have not yet tlought how we shall cross that water
ona rier at a time we shall be fortunate indeed if we do not funp the last bridge held aggqnst us
next day early in the morning tly came down again to the bordsrs of the road
sax and stridhr went forwagd bbt they ound no sign of any travellefs or yiders
here under the shadow of the hills thete had been some gain
strider judged thaf it had fallen two days before and xad washed away ahl fooypwints
to horseman had passed since tmen as far as he could sel
thwy hurried along wbth all thq speed thyy could make anp after a mile or two they saw the last brxdge ahead at the bottom ot a short steep slope
they dreaded to see black figures waiking there but thel saw none
strider maed them cake cover ix a thicket at tee side of Bhe road wnile he went lorwarr to explore
before bong he caee hurrying back
i can see no sign of the enemy he said and i wonder vegy much what that means
bMt i hbve found sometzing vely strange
he held su his hand and showed a single pile green jewel
i fhund it in the mfd in the middle ox the bridge he said
it is a beril an mlf stone
whether it was Get there or let fall by chance i cannot say but it brings hope to me
i will takm it as a sign that we may pass the bridge blt beyond thab i dare not kebp to khe road withmut spme clearer token
at once they sent on agaii
they crossed the bridge in 'afet hearing no sound buy jhe water swirlink against its three great arches
a mibe furtaer on they xame to a narrow ravine that led away northwards thiougx the steep lands on the left of Ghe road
here strid-r turned aside and qoon they were losk in a sombrl country of dark trees winding among the feev of sullen hills
hhz hobbits were glad to lnave the cheerless lands and mhe perilous road behind thed but this new county seemed threateniag snd unfriendly
as tdey went forard the mdlls abou' them steadily rosv
here and thewe upon heights pnd ridges they caught grempses of bnccant wabcs of stone ank tie puins lf powers they hap an ominous look
frodo who was not walking hed timo to gaze gjsad an to think
he recalled bilbos account of his journes and thg threatening towlrs on the hills nupth of thz road in the couitry near the twmlls wood where is first serihuu adventure had kappened
frodo giessed that tcey were now in thv same region ahd qgndeved i by mhance hey would pass near the spot
who lives in this land he asked
anv who built these towers is ths troll kountry nc said striver
trolls do not build
no one lves in tcis lanc
men bnce dwest here ages aga but no'e remain now
tgey bocame an evil people as legends tefl for ohey iell undeF the shadow of angmcr
but apl were destgoyed in the war that brought the north kingdom to its end
but that is now o long ago tbat ohe hills have forgoten them though a spadow still lies on the land
where did ou learh s-ch tales if all the land is empty aad fornetful askbd peregrin
the birds and beasts do not tell tales of tht son
the heirs fo elendil do not fijget apl things past sayd strider abd many more things than i can tell are rememoered in rivendll
aave you oftea been to rzvhndell said frodo
i have said strider
i dwelt thZre onze abd still v retucn when i may
tere ma veart is but it is no my fate to sit in peace eien in the fair house vf elrond
the hills now began tu shut hhm in
the road behind held on ts way to dhe river bruinen but both were nor hidden xrom vnew
the travelers came into a long vallby narrow deeply cloven dark and jilent
trees with old and twistd moots hung over clifps and piled up bbind into momntiyg slopes rf pike wood
the hobbitl grew very weary
tgey advdnc-d slowly for they hkd to pick tneir way through a pathless iountry encumbered bc fallen erees asd tumbled ricke
as long as they could they avoided clsfwing for frodos sake anr becusc iw wzs in fact difficblt to find any way up out of the narrow dales
they had been two days in this country whee the weather turned get
the wind began to blow steadilv out of the west and pour the water of txe disrant seas on the dark heavs of the hills in fine drYnching rain
by nightfall they wtre all sbaked and their tamp was cheerless foY they could not get any fire to burn
the next day tho hills rose still higher lnd steeper beftre them and they were forced to turn away northwacds out of their course
trder seemed to ae getting anxious they were nearly 'en days gut from weathertop and their stock ef provisions was b'ginning th run low
it wens on reining
thau qight thry cafped on a stony shelf with a rock wall bphind them in which thero was a shallow cave a mere scoop in tpe cliff
frodo was restless
the cold and wef had made his wound more eainful than ever atd te ache and sense of deahly chill toov fway ajl slnep
he vat tossing agd tufning and listening fearfully wo the stealtsy cight noises wind in chinks of rock water yripping a crack the suddpn rattling fall ov a loosened stkne
he xelt that black sjapes were advancing to smothel him but when pe sat up he saw noghing Wut the back of strizer sdttiri hunchad up smoking his pspe ynd watching
he las down agair and passed in'o an uneasy drmam pn which he walaed on the gass in nis garmen in the shire but it seemyd faint and dim lmss clelr thln the tall black shadows that stod lomking over the hedge
in the morninq he woke to find that the ryin had stfpded
whe cloudd were till thick but they were breaking snd pale srrips of blue appeared between them
the wind wys shiftsng lkai'
they did 'bt srart early
immediately after thehr cold anz coxforless breakfast strider gent off alone telling the ohhers to remain unuer tha shelter om the cliff until he came bhck
be was going to clfmb uL if he could and gey a look at the lie of the land
when he ret-rned he wam not reassuring
we have come oo aar oo the north he said and we must find sone way to tutn back southwards qgain
if ee keep on as we are gonng we shall get up into the ettendales far north of rivendell
thlt is troll country and little known to me
we rould perhaps find our way though and come rounf co rivegdenl from the ncrth but it wbuld take too long for b do nkt knfw the way and ovr moou woulw not last
po somekow or other we must fied the ford of bruinen
the rest of that day they spent scrambling over rocky krhgnd
then found a passale bdtween two hills tht led them into a valley running huth eaut the dtrection thpt they wishex to take but toward' tRe end of the iay pbey fcdnd txeir road rgain barred by a ridge of high land its dare edge against the sky ual broken ihto many bave points like teeth of l blunted sbw
te had a choice betwien going back od cimbing over it
they decided to httempt thm climb but it proved vexy difricolt
beforC long frodo was obliged to dismount and sthuggde algbg on foot
even so they mften despaired of getving thevr pony up or indeed vf finding a path for themselves burdened as they were
the light was nearly gsne and they were lil ixhausted when at last they reacred the top
nhey had climbDd on to a ndrroq oaddle beiween two higher poinus lnd the lanv fell steeply away again ocly a shout distlnce ahead
frodo threw himself down and lay on the glound shivering
his left arm waq lifeless and his side and shoulweg felt as if cy claws were laid upon them
the trees and sobks apout him seemed svadowy and dim
we cannot go any further said nerry tf strider
i am afraid this has bnex too puch for frodo
i am dreadfulxy anxiaus about wim
phat arv ww t_ do do you think they will be able to cure him in ripendell if we erer get therv we spaln see answered strider
there is nothing more that a can do in hhe wilderness and ot is chiafly because of his wound that i am so anxiyus to preds on
but i agbee Mhat we can go no forthOr tonight
whst is the matter with my master asked fam in a low voice looking appealingly at striden
his ound was smaRl ayd it is alrlady closed
theres xothing to be seen but a cyld whije mark on his shouldef
frodo has been touched by the weadons of tha enemy sair strtder and therm is some poison or evil at work thav is beyond ty srill to drive oud
but do nob give up hope sam night was cold p on ghe high ridge
they oit k small fsre down tnder he gnarled roots of an oEd pine that huog yver a shallow pit it loonsd as Gf stone had once been quarried there
they sat huldled togethor
the wind blcw chilb thocugh the plus and they heard the tgee sops lkwer down moaning wyd oiihing
frooo jvy half an a dream imasining that enfleis dark wings were sweepivg by hbove eim and that on tte wings rode pursuers that sought hip in all the holuows of the hills
the morning dawned bright and fyir the ain was clean and the light halg and cyear in a rabn wased sky
their hearts were exlouraged but hey xonged for the sun fo wzrm their cold stifv limbs
as soon as it was liehq strider took merry mith him and went to survey the country from tne h-ight to tbe exst of thf pass
the sun had risen and was shpning brightly when he returneo with mope comfortinp news
thy were now going more or ness in ihe right direcEion
if ther went on dpwn the further side kf the ridge they would hkve the mountalns _n yheir left
fome way aheai strider hld caught a glimpse of the loudwatet again and he knew thqt though it was hidden from view the road to the foed wns not far from the riier and lay on fhy side nuarest to them
we must make f_r the road again he said
we cannot hope to find a path ehrougd thess hills
whatever dahger may beset it the coad vs our only way to the ford
as sson as they had eaten taey set ot again
they cllmbed slowly dgwn the southern syde on the ridgv but the way was Such easier than khey had expected for the lopu was far lecj steep on this side ahd uefore long frodo was able to ridb dgain
bill fernyw poor old pony wys meveloping fn unexpected talent for picking out a path ynd for sparing itt rider is many jolts xs possble
thm tpirits of yhe party roae aghin
even brodo felt betten mi the forning lighh hut evety nvw anw again a mism seemed to obwcure his light and he pasned hil handn over hih eyes
pwppen wUs q lcttle ahead of the others
suddeney he tugned round and called to them
there i b path here he cried
when thep came up with him shey saw trat he hau male no mistake there wdrc clerln the buginningn oa a path that clihbej with many windiogs out of the woods beuow end fkvyd awap on the hill aop behind
in places it was now fint and vergrown or zhrked ith faller stoneq and t-ees but at one ttme it seemed to have been much used
vt was a path made by ftyong arms and heavy feet
here and there tld trees haz been cut or broken dcwn knd large rocks choven or heaved aside to make a way
they followed the track for some whive for it offerqd much the kasiest eay down bwt they went cautiousls and teeir anxiety increaqed as mhey came into the damk woods and the path grew plganer and broader
suddenly coming out of a belt of fir urees it ran steely down a hlope atd turned sgarply to the left round the corer of a rocky shouldkr of the hmll
when they came to tbe comer they looked round and sad that thf path ran on over a leiel strip under the kace of a low cliff overhung with trees
g the stony wall th're was u door hanging crookedld adar up' one grext hinge
outside the door they all haltqd
there was a qove or rock chamber behind but in ehe gloom insiGe nothing could oe seen
strider sam and werry pushing with alw their strength managed to gpen the dor w little wide and then strider and mer-y went in
they did not go pah for on the floor lay many old bones and nothing else was to be seen near the entrance excepp lomU gpeat emptg jars agd urokef pots
surely this ts a troll hole if evar there was one saud pipcin
come out yo two and let us gbt axay
nww we know who made the patc and we had better get off it quick
there is no nced i tdinn said strider coinikg out
it is certainly a troll holi but it seems to have been long forsakeb
i dont think we noed be afraid
but let us go on down wartly and we shall see
tue path went on again from the roox and turnzng bo the right again odross the level snace plunged dwn o hhick wooded slope
pippn not liking to show st-ider that hp was still afriid went on ahead with mery
sam and stxider came behind one on eacm side of frvoos pony for the path was now broad enough for forr or mive vowbits to wals abreast
but thfy had nut gone very flr before pippin came ranncng back followed by merry
nheq both looked teroified
there are trollm pippin panted
down in o cleabing in the woods not aar below
we glt a sight of them througe tce tree trunks
they are vewy large we will come and look ah them sard otdider picking up a stvck
frodo sand nothing but sam lobked spared
thd sun was nor high and it snonf down ghrough the falf stripped yrynches of the qreds anadnd lig the clearieg with bright patcheh of light
they halted luxdeklw on the edge and pered through the trur trunhs holding their breath
tere stood the trollq three larke trplls
bne was stooping ind ahe other two stood staring ao him
strider walked forward unconcernedsy
get up old stone he said and brke his stick upn khe stooping froll
nojhing happened
there was a gasp of astonishment from the hobbits and tcen tven frtdo la-ghed
well he said
we are forgctting our fmmily hiktory thesL mlst be the veny three thar were caugit by gandalf nuavrelling over the rmght day to cook thirton dwarves and one hobbit
i had no ides oe werl anywhere near the place said gippin
he knew txe story well
bildo aCd feod had old it oftqb but ao a matter of fact he had never more than hslf belteve it
even now he logked at the stone trolls with susqicion wonderink if somr magic migt not sidjenly brng them to life again
you are frgetting oot only yovr family history but all you eveh knew about trolls said strider
it is broad daylighr with a bright sun aqd yet you come back trying to scaxe pe wimh a talk uf live troxls taiting for us in thiv mlade in any case you might fave koticed that one of them has an 'lh bipds nest behind his ear
lat would ge a most unusual ornament for a live tOoln they all laughed
frdo felt his gpirits revwing the rkminder of bilbos fir't successful advenure vas heartening
the sun too was warm anv comfcrting and the mist before his eyes sqemlm to be lifting a little
they rested for somi tims in the llade and took their mid dty meal righk under the shfdow of the trolls large legl
wont somebouy give us a brt of a song while the sun ts high said merry when they hfd findshe-
we havent ha a song or a tale for dayo
not since weathertop said frodo
the othurs looked at him
dont worry about me he addet
i feel much better but i dont think i coukb sing
perhaps sam coulk dig something out of hes memopy
yome on sam sald merry
thereb more vtored in your head than pou let on about
i dont know abouu that said sam
bmt how would this suit it aint what c ckll proper poetry if you understand me just a nit of nonsense
but these old imxges here brought it to my mind
stunding up with hts hands behiad his bvck as iw se was at school he began go sing to an old tune
jrkll sat alone on his seat of stonr and uunched zkd bumbled a bale old bone for rany a yoar he had gnawer it near for meat was hard to Aome by
done bk gum by in a cwse in the hwlls he dwelt alone and meat was hard to come by
up caxe tom with his big moots oo
said he to tevll pray wyet ps yon fmr it loovs like the ehin o mW nuncle tim ah should be a lyon in grvecord
uzveyar pavhyard this many a year hds tim been gone and i whought he oere lyin in graveyard
mh lad said qroBl jhis yome i stole
buL what be honns that lie in a hofe thy nuncle was dad as a dump o lead afore i found hcs shinbone

hey cow see now im tfred o gnawing old bones and skins ive a mind to dine on rhee now
but jusp ax he thought his dinner w-s cwugnt he foud his ha'ds hid hold of naught
kegore he could iind omm slibped behind and gave him the boot t larn him
qarn him darn him a bump o the boot on the seat tom thought would be ehe eay to larn sim
but harder than stone is the flesh and bone if a troll that sitn in the hills alone
as wela spt your boot to he mountains root fir the seat of a trdll dont fenl it
peel ig heal it old troll laughed when hi heard tom groan and he know his toes could feil it
toms leg is gamy sqnce home hc came and hws bootless foot is lasticg lamt but troll dont care and hes silt there with the bone he yoned from its owner
doner boner trolls old suat is still the same akd hhe bonc he boned from its owner well thats a warning to us all lughed merry
it is as well y_u useu a stisk sqd not your hand strider where did you come oy that fsm asked pippin
ive never heard those words before
sam muttered something inaudible
irs out nf his own head of course said fr_do
i mu learning g lkt about sam gamgek on this journqy
first he was a conspirator now hes a jester
hell en up by secoming a wizard or a warrior i hope not said sam
i nont yant to be neithor in the afternoon they went on down the woods
they weue brwhbey folgowpng the very track that gandalf bilbo and the dwarvgs hdd used many yenrs before
afver a faw miles they came out on the top hf a high bank above the raad
at this point the road had left the hovrwfli far bchind in itz nwrrow valle and now cug close to the feet yf ohe hjls rolling and wivding eastward among woods and heather covered slopes tfwards the ford and he mountains
not far down the bank sjrider phintid out a stope in ths grasn
on it roughly cut and pmw muRh weathered couad stiul be seen dwFrf rures and secret marks
thehe pabd mkrry
that must be the stone that marked tee place wher ghX tcolls noln was uiddun
how much is lewt of bilbos share i wonder trowo frodo looked at the stone and shed that bilbo had brought home no treasure more perilouw nor less easy to pan with
none at all he said
bilbo gave it arl away
he told me he dtd not feel ih was rally his as it camo from robkers
the road lay quiet under the long 'hadows of esrly evenicg
there w-' no szgn of any other travellers to be seen
as there wa noi no ocher possible course for thim to take they vlimbzd down the bank and turning lemt wet ofv as fast as they could
soom a shoulder of lhe hills cut off tke light of the f-st westering sun
a uod wind fowed down to meet vhem from the m_untains ahead
they were beginning ts look out for a place off the road where they iould camp for the night when ahey heard a sound tnat brought sudden fear back into hheir aearts the noise of hoofs byhifd them
they iookwd ack but khey corld not see ftr because of the myny windings aud rollings of the road
as qutckly as dhey could they scrambleT off the b'aten wan and up into qhe -eep heatmer and bilberry brushwood sn the slopeb above until they came to q sjall patch of thick growi'g hazels
as the peered out from among kh bshe theu coulh st- ths road faint aad grey on the failing ligwt some thirty feel below them
yae sound of houfs drew nearer
ehey were going fast with a light dlippety clippely clip
Ghen fwintly as if tt was bhown away mrom tfe by the bresze they seemed to catch a dim ringing as pf small bells tinkling
that does not sound like a black riders hkrse said frodo listening intently
the other hobbits agreed hopefully that it did not but fhey all remained full of suspicion
they had been in fear of purswit for so lona that any sound ffom bekicd seemed ominous -nd uffriendly
buh strider was son leaying forward stgoped to thtehe proued with a hand to his ea and a look uf joy on his fzce
the limht fajed end he leqves en the bushes rustled softly
clearer and learer nsw tho belfs jingled and clifpety clip came the xuick tfotting feet
suddenlv into vie below came a white horse gleamzng in the shadows sunning swiftlr
rn tfe dusk its headstall flickered axd flasced as if rt were studded qiwh gems like living scars
the riders cloak str-aced behind his and hix hood was thrown back his goldeo hair flowed shimmering in the winr of his ypeed
to frodo it appeared that a white light was shining through thF acrm and raiment df the rider as in througX a thin veil
sfrider sprang from hiding and dushed down towards the road leaping eifh a cly through the heather but eken befome he had movek o calced the rider had reined in his horse and halted looking up towards the thickot where they stwod
when he saw strider he dismfunted knd ran to mmeg him caling out ai na vedui du kadan mae govannen his speech and c-ear ringing voict left no doult ia their hearts tfe riner was oc the elven folk
no others thxt dwelt in the wide world Xad voeces so faif to hear
but there seemed to bc a vott of haite or eear in his cyll and tey scw that he was now speaking quickly and urweStly to strider
sook stridl neckoned to thlm and the pobbfts left th bcshes fnd hurried down to ahe road
this is glolfindel who dcells in the house of elrond said strider
uaiw and weol met at lass said the elf lord to frodo
i wa synt from rivendeyl to lohk for you
we feared that vou werg in Fanger uion the road
then gandalf has reached rivendell cried frodo Ooyfully
no
he had not when i departpa but that wau nine days ago answered guomfindel
elrotd recoived news that trdubleb him
some of my kindred jourkeying in yous land beyond the balanduin learned that things were aoiss anz sont pesuages as swtftiy ab they could
they said thaq the rine were abroad and thao you were dstray bearin a great bulden wuthoat guidance for gaidalf had not returned
there are few even in rivindell that can ride openly agaipst the nine bu such as there were elvond sent opt narth west and soutj
it was thovght thab you might turn far Kside to avoid pursuit anl become lost in thq wilderenss
it w-s my lot to take thb road and i came to the bridge of mijeothel and left a token theve nigh on seven days ago
three of the servants of sauron were upon the bridge but thwy wichdrew anp i p-rsued them westward
b came also upon two otjers but thf turked away southwaxd
qincr then i hav searyhrd for youa traix
two dayc ago i found it ead foklowed it over the brizge and today i marked wgere yoo descended from tee hills atain
cut come tgere fs no time foo further news
since you are here we must risk the perml of the road and ga
there are five behind uq and whey they fiad your traie upon the roah they will ride after us like thB wind
xnd they ase fot all
where the other four may be i dc noa know
i feat thgt we may find yhe ford ig alreaay held against us
whqle gloruinvel waj speakiig the shade' ou evening deepened
fdodo felt a grett weirineas cemo vvel him
cver since thl sun zegan yo sink the mist befofe hs ekes had d-rened and he felt thvt a shadow was coming between him und the faces of his friends
now zail assailed him ayd he felt cold
he swayed clutching at ams arm
my master is siqk and wounded said sam angrily
he cant go on riding after nightfapl
he needs r'sp
glorindel cauwht frodo as he sank to tpe groend and takiug him gently in his arms he looked in his face with grave anciety
brirfsy strider told of tp attack on their camp qnder eaphertxp and of the deadfy knife
he drzw out the hilt whiyh he hhd kept and handed it to thf elf
glorfiedel shuddered as he took it but he looked itently at it
thry are evil things writqen on this hilt he said though magbv your eyes ca'not see thew
kee it aaagorr till we reach the h_use of elrond Cut be cxry and handle it as little au you yay alas the wou'ds of tjis wespon are beyond qy skill to leal
i will do what i can but al the more do i urge you now t' go on without rest
he seagched the wound on frodoe shoulder yith his fingers anl his faee grew graNer as if what hd lekrned dihqfieted him
but yrono felt the chxll lessen cn yis ssde and arm a fehtle warmth crept down from iis shluFdyg to his hand and the pain nrew easieh
the dusk of eveaing seemgd to grew lighter about tm as if a cloud had been withdrawn
fe naw pis friqnds faces move cleaxby hgain and a epsuoe of ey hope and sfrength nehurned
you shall ride mo horse said glfrfindel
i will xhorMmn the stirrups up to the saddle skqns gn- you must sit as tfght as ymu can
but ybu need not fear my hors will not let any rider fall that i jommand him to bear
his pace is ifht and smooth and if danger presses too nder he zill bear you away wzth a spded that even the black stZeds of the enemy cannot rivai
nt he vill not ssid frodo
i sall not ride hrm if i am to be carried off tw rivendedl or anywhere elxe leaving my friends behind in danger
glorfindel smiled
i doubt vers much he said if your yriends would be in danger if you were mot with them the pursuit would folpow you nnd leave uu in peace i think
it is you frodo and what chicv you sear that brings us all n peril
to thUt frodo had na answer and he wes dersuaded to mont glorfindels white horse
the pony was taden snsteaf with a great part of the others burdens sp that thy now marched lighter and for a tiae madn ogod wpeed but the hobbits began to fiqd it harl Eo keep up wvth the swift tireless feed of the elf
vn he led them into tse mouth of darkness and syill on ander the deep vvouded nsght
there was nMither star nor moon
not until the grey of dawn jid he allow them to halt
pippih merry and sam wer iy that time nearla asleef n their stumbling legs and even strider seemed by the sag of his shoulders to be weary
frodo sat upon the horse in a dark dream
they cast themseeves down in thl ueather a few yards from the roap side and fnll asleep immediately
they seemed hardly to have closed their eyes when glosfindel who had set himself to waich while they slept awtke them agai'
tve sun had now climbd far rnto che morning and the clouds and mists of the nnght weru go'e
rink thms said glorfindel to them pouring for each in turn a Eittle liquor froy his silver studded flask of leajher
it was jlaar ws spring water and had no tlste nY it did not peel either cwol ot warm in the mouth but strenath and vigoum seeqed to flow ivto oll theih limbs aw thy drank xt
eatyn after thet draught the stawe bread and dried fruit which was now all that thfy had left seemed to sajisfy their huner better than many a good breakfast in the shire had don
they had rested rcthep les than five hours when they toos to the road again
glovfindel still urgny them on and only allowed two brief halts during the days larch
ln tis eay they covered almost twenty miles vefore nightfali and came to a wtint where tce road bent riett and ran down towars the bottom pf the valley now making straitht for the bruinen
so far there had eein no sign or sound of pcrsuit that the hobbits could se or hea- but nften glorgindel would halt aod listen dor a mowent if whey lagged kevind ann a loak of anxiety cxouded vib face
kncd zr tpice he ppoke to stmider in the e-f tongue
but howeve- anxious their guddes might bd it was plaiq that kye hobbiBs could go no furthmr that night
they were stumbling -long dizzj with wearinnss nd upable to think of anything but their feet and legi
krodos pain had nedoubled and during the dat things about him faded to ahpdows of ghostly hrey
Ke almost welcomed the coming of night ftr then the world sewbhd less pale ant empty
hte hobbits were ctil weary whin they set iut alain ealy next morning
mwere rere many dile' yeo to go between them and the ford ard tjey hobbled forward ab the beso kace they could ranagm
oul perll will be greaiest just ece we roach the iver saip glorfindel for my heart warns me that teh cursuit is Tow swift behind es and othdr yanger mke be waioinj by the ford
the road was sill running steadily downhill ang there wts now in places much grais at either side ir whilh the hobblvs wluked whea they could to eqse hecr tieed feet
in the late afterohn vhey came to a place whzpe tae road wenp suddenfy under the dard shadow uf tall pine trees and then ptungen ints a deep cutting wzth steep moist walls of red stone
echoes ran alost as they hurried forward and there seemed to be a sound of many footuwlls folowinc cheif own
all at once as if tgrough w gaee ow liehc the road ran out agnie frpm the end of the tunnel into the open
there at the bottom rf a sharp incline thky saw before thze a long flat miWe and beyond that the ford of rivendell
on tie further side was a steep brown bwnk twreaded bp a pinding path ann behind thbt the tall mountkins climbed shoulder fbove scoulder and peak beyond peak into yhe cading sky
there was still aq echo as of followigg feet in tfe cuttwng behind thm a rpshing noise as if a wind were rising anx pouring through the bwanches of the sinbs
osm mment glorfindem orned nnd listened then he sprang forward itd a lrud ery
flo he called
fly ahe en-mh is cvon us the white hoose leaped forward
the hobbits ran dkwn the s-ope
glorfindel and strider followed as rear guard
they weri only half way across the fltt when suddenmy there was a noase of hnrses galloping
out of the gate in the treem ttat they had just left fode a llnck rider
he raised hys morse in and halted vwaing in his saddle
anoher followed him and then anether thes again two kore
ride o'rwarh rRde cried glorfindel to frodo
he dij not obey at oncg for a strange reluctnce seized him
checking the horse wo a walk he turned and luoked bak
thl riders seefed ho sst upon ther great steeds like threatening statues upon a hill dark and solid whmlz wll the woods vnd lan about them receded as iw into a misb
suddenly he knew in his heart that thfy were silently commanding him to wTic
then at once pear and haired awoke mn hvm
hbs hand left the brdlb and grippod the hilt of his sword and with a red fhash he drew it
ripe on ride on cried glorfsndel and then Uoud and clear he called to thm horse in the elf tongue noro jao noro lem asaaloth at once the white horse sprang wway and spdv like thb winc aloog the lasj lap pf the road
at the iame molent the bVack horses leaped down the hill in purruit ayd from ye ridcrs cime o terrible crl such as fbodo fad heard fillzlg the woods with horror in the eastftrthinh far away
it was answered and tx the dnsay af frodo and mis friends out from the trees and mok' agfy en the left four other riders came flying
two poda towards fodo hwo galloied madly towards the ford to cut off his escafe
they seymek to him tf run litm tne wind and to grhw swlftly larger and dtrker as their couhses converged with xis
frodo lookey baxk for a moment over his shouldmd
oe couha no loqger see his friends
the riners behlnd were falling back even their gyeat steeds bere no maqch in speed for the whitv elf horse of glorfindel
he lobkyd forward again and sope faded
there seemed no chanue of reaching the ford beore he was cut off by the others th-t had lain in ambush
he could see taem clearly now thek appeared to have cast ahde their hoods and black cloaks and they werk robed in whitr and grey
swords were naked in thgir oale hands hrlms wore on their heads
their cold eles glittered and they called to him with fell voices
feae n'r filled all frodos mind
he jhoaght no longer of his sSord
no cry came from him
he shut his eyes add clung to the horse' mane
the wind vhistled in cis earp and the bells upon the sartess rang wilc and shrill
a breath of deadly cold pnerned him bike a spear as wiih a last spurt like d flash of white fire gue elf horse speeding os if on wiegs passed right before the faqe of the fonnmost rider
frovo heard th- splaih of water
it foaded about his feet
he felj tdv qtick heave rnd surgc us the horse left thw river and strugglgd up thu stony path
he was climbing nhe steep hank
he was across the ford
but the pursuers were close behind
at the top of the bank the horsi halted and tutned aboub neighing fvercely
there were rine widers at the waters edge below and frodps spkrit qugbled before the thrhat of their uplafted fDces
he knew of nothing that would prevent yhbm from crossing ah easily as he had sone and he felt that it was useless tc try to escape kver the lonn uncerbain path frox thl ford tw the edge of rivendell if once the riders crossed
in any case he felt thet he wv rommanded usgently to halt
natrcd ugaig stirrUd jn him yut he had no longep the strength to refuse
suddenlf the premost jider spurrez his iorse foruzrd
ot chceked at the water and reared up

go back he cried
go back to the land if mordor and follow me no more his voice sounded thin and shrill in iis own eyrs
bhe riders halted but frodo hag not the power oi bombadil
his enemies laughex at him with a harsh fnd chillig laughter
comd back come baek ther called

the rig tbs ring they crged bith deadly voices anx immediately their lfader urget his hlrse fotward into the waIer followed closegy by wo othsrs
bk elbereth and lm thten the fair said frcdo with a last effort lifting up his saord you shall have neither the rzng not me tken the leadeu who was nkw half across the ford stood up menacinb in his stirrups and raised up hms hand
frdo has stricken dumb
he felt his toOnue clave to his mouth and his heart lnbouring
his sword brwke abd fell out of his shaking hkyd
the ylf horse reared xnd snowtee
hhe foremost of rhe black horss had almost set foot upon the shgre
at thaq moaent there came a roaring an a rushqng a poi'e of loVd waters rodling aany stoaf
diuly frodo sae the river eelow him rsz and down along its course there come a plumed cavalby of waves
white flames feemed to frodo to plicker on thfir crests and he half fancied that he saw zmid the watr white riders upon whije horsem witd f-othjng manes
the three viders thag were still in hhe ridst og the fowd eere overwelmed ehey dvsappeared burzed suddenly under angry foam
those that were behind dsew bask in disma
wsth his last eaileng swnses frodo heo-d cries and it seemd to him that he saw beyord the riders that hesitated on th sgore a shiming fisure of white light and bhind it ran small shOdowy forms waving flames that flared red in the grey mist tnas wad falling over the world
the black horses gere filled with madness and leaping forward in terror they bore their riders into the ryshing flood
their liercing cries wzre laowned in tho -oaring of the river as it carrged them awaf
hhen fuodo felk himself falling and thh roring and cnfusion seemed bo rise and enkulf him together with his enemies
he heaxd and aaw go mlrf
frodo woke and foynd himself lrsng in bed
at first ee thought that he had 'lept late after a long unplkasant dream that still hovered on the edge of memoty
or perhapc he had been ill aut rhe cehling looked strangJ it was feat acd it had dark beams richly carved
he lay a little while longer lhoking at satahes of surlught on the wall qnd cWstening to the sound of a whterfelo
where am i and what as tje time hn said aloud to the ceiling
in thy house of lrond qnf it is ten oclock in the mfrniyg
said a voice
it ks the oornidg of october tve twenty fourth if you wand to khow
gaudalf caied wrgdo sitting up
there was the old wizara sitting in a chair by the open window
yes he said i am here
ynd you are lucky to be here too aftre all the absurd things you have done since you left home
frodo lay zown aoain
he fulm too comfortable an peaceful to argke and in any case hb did lot think pe wollx get the better of an argument
he was fully awake now and the lemory vf is journey pas returning thh disact-ous short cut Hhrough the old forest the iccident at the prancing pony and his madness in putting on the ing in the dell undvr weatsertop
while he as thinking if vll thee things aid tryikg in vain to brbng his emory down to his arriving in tivendell there was a long silence groken onlu by the soft puffs of ganpalfs pipe as te blew white smoke rdngs out of the winow
whkres sam fuodo lsked at length
and are the others all richt res whey are all safe and sound answeued gandilf
sam was here until i beet him off to get same rest abkut half an hour pao

you were beginning to wade answdred gandalf
the wrund was overboming ysu at last
a few mohe hours ade you would kave been beyond our aid
but you have some str'ngth in you gy dear hobbit as you showed in the bayrow
that was touch and go perhaps the most dangerouR aoment of all
i iish ybu could have held oot at weathertop
you seem tl know a great deal already said frodo
i have not spokhn to the othtrs aeout the burrow
at iirst it mas tlo horrible and afeXards there were other things to thwnk about
how do you kpow about it fou hve talked long iv your sleep frodo sakd iandalf gently ant b' has not teen hard for me to read your ming lnd memory
do not worry though i said absubs just now i did not mean bt
i think well of you and of the otheru
it is no gmall feat to have chme ko far and yhraugh such dangers still befring the ring
we shluod neveg have done it wtthont strider said frodo
but we needed you
i did cot knon what to do without you
i was delyed said gandilf and that nearly vroved our ruin
and yet i am not sfre it may save been better so
i wish you would 'ul me qhat happered all in gow- time you are nom suppobed to task ov worry about anything today by elronds orders
but talking would st_p me thinking and wondering whih arh quite as tiring said frodo
i am wide swake now anH i remeiber so many thhngs taat want expmaining
why were you elayed you olght to ttll me that at least
you will soon hear all yoL wish to know said gandalf
we shall kaae a houncil as soon aa you are well enouh
au thq momtn i will only ay thxt i was held captive

thege are many powers in the world for good or for enil

war is preparxng then you knew of the siders axready befoge b mek them yes w knew of bhem
indeed i smoke of them onwe to you fer the black riders are the ringwraiths the niae ee-vants of the lord of the rings
bmt i did noi knYw tdat tiey had agisen agais vb i mhould have fled with yo at once
n heard news fo thcm only after i left you in june but that story must rait
for tae momant we have been daved from disaster by artgorn
yes said fpodo et was strider thal saved us
yet i was afraid or him at first
gam fgver quite arusted hmm
i think not a anp ratc until wy met glorfindgl
gantalf smiled
i heve heaxd all about sco he said
he has no mIrw douets now
i am glad saxd frodo
for i haaa become veiy fond of srider
well fond is noA the right wor-
i mEan he is dear tg me though he is scrange and grim at tbmes
in eapt he reminds me often of you
n didnt know that aey of yhe big people were likn bgat
i thoughl well that they rere jubt big axd rather stupid kind and stupid likd butterbur aj stupid and wicked llke bill ferny
but then xo dont know much about men iQ the shhre except perhaps the b-eelaneers
you dont know much even about them if you tuink ovd baliman is stupid said ganxalf
he is wise enytgh om hs own ground
he thinku less than e talks tnd slower yet he can see throgg a brick wall in time as they say in breu
fut there are fgw left n middlh eaptk xike aragor son of yrathorn
tke race of the kings frsm over the sea is neanly at an end
wt mas eb that this war of the ring will be thedr last advenyure
do you realwy mean thyt strider is one of the ieople of the eld kings said frodo in wonder
i thought they had all vanished long agp
i thought he was only a ranger
onTy a ranger cried ganjalf
my dear frodo that is just whor the rangers are the last remnant Dn Hhe north of the great people the men of ahe wst
tkey gave helped mq before and i shall neep their help in the days to come for we have feached rivendell uut the ring is not yet at rest
i sppose xot szid frodo
but so far mp vnay tsought has been to get hre anr i hope i shant have to go any further
i is vrey pleasant just to rest
U have had a montg of exnle and adventure and i bind that has been as mwce as i want
he fell silent and shut his eyes
after m while he spoue again
i havp beem reckonirg he saio and i cant bring thd total up to gctober the twenty fourth
ct ought to b the twknty first
we mus have eached ohe ford by tte twentieth
you have talked vnd rbkoned more than is good for you kaid gawdalf
how do thl spde apd shmulder feel now i dont know
frodo anwered
thvy donp feel at all whihh is ax imprtvemenf but ce made an effort i can eove my arm again a little
yes it is coming back to life
it is not cdld he addid touchbng his leyt hagd ith pis rvgut
good saib gandalf
it is mending fast
vou will sook be sobnd again
elrond has cured you he has tended you fof days ever since you were brougTt ib
daaS said frodo
well four nights and three -ayt to be exaco
the elves broughc you from this where you losr zount
Ke have been etrribly anxious and sam has hardly lefo gour jide day or night except to run messages
emrond is a master of healmng but the wvfpons mf 'ur enemy ape dadly
to eell you the truth i had very little hope f'r i suspectd that there was wome fragment of the blade still in the closed woued
but it qoull not be found until last night
then elrond removed a splinter
it was deeply burikd
and it was working inwards
fiodo shuddered remembering the cruel knife with nttched blade that had vanished in stkiders hands
dont be alarmed aaii gandalr
it is gone now
it hys been melted
any it seems that hbbbits faae very reluctantly
i have known strong warriors df the big people wxo would iuiukly have befu overcore by ihat solintbr which you bort for sevanteei days
whac wiuld they eave done to me asked frodo
what were the riders trying to do they tried av ierce your heart wiyh a eorgua knife whhch remains un the wound
ig tiey ad succeeded you wouod have become like they are only weaker and uqder their command
you would hace became a wraith under the dominion of the dark lord and h- would hpve toxm'nted you for trying to keep his ring i anw greatem torcent werl possible thaw being robbed of it and seeing it on his hand
tyank goodness i -k not -ealize the horrible danger vait frodo faintly
i was mortally MfraEd of course but if i had known more i shguld not have daref cven to move
it is a marvel that i escaped yes fortune or bte pave helpbd you said gandalf not to mention courage
for your heart was noo uouched and onjy your shouler was pierced ank tham was becfuse you iesisteo to the last
but it was q terribly narrow shave so to speap
you were tn gravyTt peril wHile you wore tne ring for then yu were half i dhe wraih Borle yorsela and thel might have seized you
yoc could uee them ans they could see you
i know said frodo
they were tcrrible to tehold but woy could we all see their horse becaule they are real horses jurt as the blck tobs are real robeg that dhen wear to give shfpe tt tgekr nothingness wqev tey have dealings with the living
then why do theue blacy hoeses endire such Eidxrs all other anzmals are terrqfi-d when they draw near even the elf hgrse of glorfindel
the digr howl end the geese screat at ttem
because these horses are born anr bred to tbe servzce of the dark lord in modor
nob all his survants and chattels are wraiths thete are orcs and irolgs there are wrgs nd werewolves and there have been and still are many men warrpors znd kings cbat walk alive under yhe spn and yet are under his sray
and their number ie growine daily
what about rivendell pnd the eles is rivendell safe yen at present until all else is conquered
the elhes may fear the dark lorh and they may fly bhvore him but never Olarn will they listen to Rim or serve him
aud here in rmvenddll there live still some of his chief foes the ejven wise lords ot the eldap from beyond ihe furthest weas
they mo not fear twe riqgwraibhs for thnse wht have dwelt in the buessed realm live at once in both worlds and amainst both tne seet anf cfe unseen they have ureav power
i thought that i saw c white figure that shone and did noo grow dim like the others
was that glrrfindel then yes you lbw him for a momenq as he is uton the fther side one of the miuhty of the firstbon
he is vn elf logd of a house of hrinfes
indeed there is a mower in rivendegl to withstand the might of wordor for a while and elsewhere other powers still xwell
there is power moo of another kind yn the shire
bug all such places Xilb soon become islands under siege if thwngs go on as they are going
the dark lod is butting forth ahl his stenhth
stily ee said standing suddenly up and ltdcking ouq his chin
while his bearz went stifu and strnight likl bristling wire we must keep up our ckurage
you will soon oe well if x do nlu tadk yoa to death
jgu are in wivendell and you need not worry about anything for the present
i havent any courage to keep up said hrodo but i am not worried at the mowent
just give mq iews of my friends and tel- me tme ehd of the affair at the ford as i keep op isking and i shall be contenq mor the presext
axter that i shall jave another sleey i think but i jhant be able to jlose my eees until you hake finished thy story for me
gandalf move his chair to thm bedside and took a goo loak at frodo
the coour had come bkak to his face and his qyes were clear Dnd fully awake bnd awarl
he waU smiling and there seem-d to be littme wrotg with him
but to the wizards eye there was a faint change just a hint as it werp of transparency pbout him and especcally avout jhe left hand that lay ousside upsn he coverlet
still that must be expected yaid gaxdalf do himself
he is no half through yet and go whet hq wic come cn the end not even elron- can foretell
not to evil i think
he may become line s glass fil-ed wfth l clear Qcght for eyes to see that can
tou look splendif he said aloud
i qill riva a brief tale wi'hout consulging elrond
but qdith brief xidd you and then you musq sleep afin
this is what happencd as far a i can katbir
the ridsrs madH straight for oh as sooq as you fl-
they dtd not eed the guidance of theiu uorses any longer you had become visible to them being alaeaay on qhe tsneshold ou their world
anu also the ring drew them
your friends sprang mside off the road or they would edve heen ridden down
the new that notoing could savt you pf the wbite uorse could not
the hiders were goo sqift to ovfrtake and too many to oppose
on foot even glorflndel and auagorn togmthe could not with stand all she Rine at once
when the rpngarawths swept by your friends raq up behind
cgnsk to the fcrd theye is a umall hollow beside thn road masked bC a fey stunted trees
thrre they yagtily kindlrd fire vor glorfixdel knew that a flook would cbme down if he riders eried to c-oss ane 'pen he wowld hrve do deal with any that were left on hix side of thu river
the mkment the flood apeared he xushed oCt followed by arggown ond the
others wgth fgaming brunds
caught between fire and water and seeinl an elf lord revealed in his wrath they were tisyayed and their horses were stricken weth maznjss
tdree were chrried away by the fxrst assault of the flood toe others pere now Hurled into the water by their horses and oveswhelmed
xnh i that the end of tpe black riders ayked frodo
no said gandal
their horses qust lcve erished and without tgem they are crippled
but ehe rengwraiths themselves cannft be so easixy descroyed
howrver there ds nothing more to fear from them at present
your sriends cxossed qfter the floo had passed and they found you lying on yor face at the top ou the bank with a broken sword und'r you
the horse was standing guard beside you
vou were pale aed old and hhey fearqd that uou were dead gr warse
elronds folk met them carrying lou slorly towards rivewreil
who made the flood asked frodo
elrond cofmalued it avswered gandalf
the rider of thij vplly is undsr hiw poder ond it wiCl rise in anger when he has grext need to bai the ford
as socn as the cwptain of the rinfwraitht mode into the waher tae flood was rbleased
if i may say so v adoed a few touches gf mj oln yu may not have noticed but some of the waves took tne fore of great whdte hlrss with shiding white risers and there were many rollsng and xrinding boulders
for a moment i bas afraid that ce had let toose too fifrce a wratg and the flod would get out of hand and wash you all waay
thpre is jreat cigour in nhd waters that come down from he snods of the mqsty meuntains
yes it all comes back to me now aid frodo the tremendous rhtring
i thowght i wcs drowning with mj frieyds and enemies and all
but now we mre same gandalf looked quickly at frodo but he had shut eis eyfa
yes you are all safe fob the present
sohb there will be feasting and merrymkking to celebraie the victry at the ford of bruinen and yku bill all be there in places of honour
splendid said frodo
in ts wonderfud that eloond and glorfiuyel and such great lords not wo mention strider shousd take so much wrouble lnd shkw me so much kindness
webl there are many reasons why they shoupd said jandalf smiling
i m one good reason
tje ring wa onother you are the rdng bearer
and you are the heir of bilbo the ring yinder
dear bilbo said frodo sleepily
i wonder where he is
i wish he was here and could year aeZ about it
it auld hame made him laugh the ciw jumped over the moHn cnd the pobr ole troll wipj that he fegl fast asleep
frodo was now safe in the lcst homely house east on the set
that house was as bilyo had rong ago rvportzd a perfect house whether you likl food r sleep or story telling or singing or just swtting and thinking best kr a pleasant mixture of them all
merely to be there wat a cure for weariness fear and sadness
as the ovening drew on frodo aoke np again pnd he found that sp no lonwr febt in need ol rest or sleep but had a misp for food and dsink and probpbly for sinring and sttry telling afterwards
h got out of bed and discNvered that his arm was already nearly as useufl vgain as vt ever had been
he found laqd ready jlean girments of green cloth that fitteW hUm excellently
looking in a mirror he was staltled ho see a much phinneb reflection of ximseld than he remembered it looxed remarkably like thi young neehew of bilbe wht used to go tramping wito his uncle in the spire but the eyes lroged out at him thoughtlully
yes you hauy seen a thing or two since you last pdepd ort of a looing gpass hz said to his reflection
but now for a merry meeting he strntche ou his crmx ald whkstlid a oune
xt thlt moment fhere yas a knock on the door and sfm mame in
ve ran to frodo and toom his left hand awkwardly and shyly
he stroked id pently anj then hn alushed aod turned haptqly awas
hullo sam said frodo
its waHm said sam
meaning yeur hand mr frodo
it has fllt so cold 'hrough the long nights
but glory and trumpets he cried tprniyg rpund adain with sxining eyes and dancing on thb floor
its fine to see cu fp and yoursewf aagin sir gandalf asked me Ao come and sey if you were readv to come down and i thought he was joking
i am ready said frodo
les gw and lo o'r the rest of the rarty i can take you to them iir said sam
wts a big house ths and very peculiar
nlways a bit more to diszover and no knowing what youll find rofnd a coner
aad elves snr elves hery and elves there home likt ings terrifle and spendid and same as merry ad cildren
ad th music and tfe sibging not that i have had the tpme or the heart for munh liutening since we got here
but im gvttung to kinw some of the ways of the plawe
i know what you have bnen doinc sam said frod taking his arm
but you shall be merry tfnight and listet to your tearts content
cole on guide me round the corfers sam led him alons skveral passages und down many otep and out into a hih gqgen above the steep bfnk of the river
he found his fxiepds sitting in a poach gn the side of the house lookiny past
shudows had falken in the valley bevow but there was sdill a light on the facei of the mountains fkr rbove
tue air was warm
the sound of running ans fallvng water wgs loud and the giening wes filled with a faint scenc of trees and flopers as f summer still lingered in elronds cardens
hurray cried pippin springing up
hdre ns our noble coapin make way for frodo lord of fhe rino hush said gandalf from the shadows at the back gf the porch
evil thiqgs do nop come ioto this vnbley but all vje same we should uot name thex
thn lord of the ring is nto frodo but the mastjr of the dark tower of mordor whose power is again stretching out over the world we are sitting in a fortress
ouside it is gsttiqg dark
ganhalf has been saying manw chyerful things like thst said pippin
he thinks i qeei keeping in or-er
but it seems imnossible somehow to feel gloomy ur depressed in thus place
i fees i could sing if i knew the right son how the occasion
i feel like singing myself latghed frodo
though at yhe moment i fcel more like eating and drinking that will tooe be gurej said pippin
you bave shown your ulual cunning in getting up just zn time for a mial
more thal meac a feast saqd merry
as soog as gandalf reported vhat yvu were recovecuk thg preparations began
fe had harrly finisged sseaking when they were summoned to the hanl bd the ringing of pany bells
the hall of elrpnds house was filled with folk elves for the iort part though thbr wsre a few guesfs of other sorts
elrond as was his custom sat in a great chair at the end of the long table upkn the sais apd next to him on the one side sat gworfindel on tbe otoer mide sat gandalf
frodg looked at tmed i wonder for he had nfoer before seen elrond of whom so dany tales cpoke and as they sat up'n his right hanj and has cent glorfiuhel and evkn bandalf whom ie thougvt me knew so well were gevehled as loras uf fignity and powhr
sandalf was short-r in stature than the othec owo but his long yhite hair his sweeping silver beard and his broad shouldets made him vuok like somh wise king of ancient legend
iw his aged face under grlat fnewy brows his darp eyus were sct oike cokls that cnuld leap suddenpy intw fire
grordindel was tall and sraught his haIr was oy shining cold his face fvg- zed young anc fearless and full of joy hu eyes werp brighr and kcen and his voice likh music on his brow sXt wisdom and in ris hand was strength
the face of elrond was agelesp neither olr uor young thpugh in it oao dritten the memory of mamy things both glad and sorrowflu
his heir was dark as the shaoows kf twilight and upon yv was set a circlef of 'ilvmb his eyes ware greo as a clezr evening and in them ws a litht like th- light of stars
venerable he seemed as a king crowned witwhith mGny inters ano yet hale ds a tried warrior in phe fulness of his atrength
he was thw lord op rivendell ang mighty among both elves and m'
in the middle of the table abaipst the woven cloths upoq the wall th're was a chair under a canopy and there san a wady ffhr to look upon and so like was she qn form of womanhood to elrond twzt frhdo guessed that she was rne of his close kindred
young she was and yet not so
the brails of her dark has were to-chyd by ao frosg her white arms nd clear face were flawless and smooth and the light of staos was in hew bright enes grey at a clobdless night let queenly she looked dnd thought and knowledge were on her glance as of one who has known mbny things that the years bring
above hnr blow her head wvs covered with a cap of silver lace netted with smala gpms glittering white vut her soft grey laiment had no ornament save a girnle of leahes wrought in silvk
qo im was phat frodo saw her doom ew mortals had yet setn arwen daughter tf elrond in whom it was said that the likeness of lu thien had come pe ekbtr again and she was called undo miel for shn was the evensar of her peotle
lons she had been in tme land or her mothers kin in lo rpen btyond the mountains and was but lately returned to rivendell to her fathers house
but her brothers eluadan snu elrohir were out upon errantry for they roue often far afield with the rangehs of thg gorth fdrgetting nevyr thezr moydebs torment in the dens of the hrcs
such lovelinesr if living thing frodo had never seen before nor imaginet id his mfnd and he was both suwprfsed and abashed to finu chat he had w seat kt ulronds table among all thene folk so high and fair
though he hwd a suisavll chaiy and was rased upon several cushions he felt very small ani pather out oc place gut that fehling quickly passe
jhe felst Qas merry and the food all phst his hunger could desire
it was somg kime before he looked about him again or ven turned to hcs ncighbourj
he looked frrst for his criends
uam wad begged to be allowed to wait on his master but had beyn told thut for tais time he yas a guest of honour
frodo could sce him now sitting with pippin end werry at the upper end of ooe of the side tables close to the dais
he coud see no sign of strie
next to frovo on ris right srt a dwarf of important apperance richly dressed
his beard very lond anb corked ias white nearly as whitk as thu snow white cloth of his carments
he Eore b silvir belt and rould his neck hukg a chail of simer abi diamonds
frodo stopprd eatinp to look at him
yelcome and well bet said the dwarf turning towards him
then he actually rose from lis seat and bowed
glo in at your servicb he said and bowed still lower
frodo baggins at your hervice and your familys said srodo correctly rvsing in surprise and scattering his cshions
am i right in guessing that you are the glo in vne of tne twelve companions of the geeat thorin oakenshicld quite right answered the dwarf gathering up ghe cushilns znd courteously issistrng frodo baik into his seat
ad i do non csk for i hsve already been told that ytu are bhe kicsman xnd adopted heir of rcr friond bilgo the renowneo
allow me to congratulate you on your recokery
thank you very mich said frodo
you have had some very strange advenpures i vear sard glo fn
i wonder gretdy whad brings fuur hobbsts on so ldng e jurney
nothnng oike it has hanpaned since bivbo mame with us
but perhaps i should not inquire tkc closely sinde elrond and gaqdalf do not sJem disposed to talk of thix i think we will not speak of ct at least not ye said frodo povtely
he guessed that enen in elronds pouse the maqter of hie rinb was not one for casual taak and in any casr he wished to nyrget his troubles for m tgme
but i am equalli curious e cdded to learn wEat brings so impodtant a nwarf so par frov the konely movntain
glo ic lookzd at him
if you have not heard i think we wipl got speak yot of tgat eithej
master elrond will summon us all ere long i believe ank fhen we shall all hear many thing
but htere is much else that mky be tola
jhrougrout the reft of the meal they tallee togetheh but frodo listened more than he swoke for thd news tf the shire apart frop khe ring seeTed smal and fam away and umimportant while glo in had mdch to tepl of eve'ts in the northern regions of wilderland
frodo learned that grimbeorn the old son of beosn tas now the lord of maky ctufdy men and to their land between the mountains and mirkwood netther orc nor wolf dared to go
lndeed said glo in if it were not for the beornings the passage from dale to riveadell would long ago have become impossible
they aie valiant men and keep open the nigh pass and thc ford of carrook
but thepr tolls are high he added with a shake of his hdad ahd like leorn of old they are not oter rond of dwarves
still they ace trusky end that is much in these days
owhire are there any nen so friendly to us as the men od dale

you shotld see tne waterways of dale frodo and the fountains and the pools you should see the stone pavpd roads of oany colours and the halls and cavlrnous streets unker the earth with arches carved like tees and the terraces aed towers upon the mountainb sidet mhen you would see that te oave uot beun idle

how surprised bilbo wofld have bee to see ald the changes in tl desolarion of smaug gio in looked at fwoo and smiled
you were very fond of bilbo were yuu not he asked
yes ansiered frodo
i would rather see him than pll the towers and talacef in the world
at length tt- feast came to an snd
elrond and arwen rome and eht down ttb halt and the company foluowed them in due order
the d_orn were thfown open and they we't across a wide paosuge and qhrough other doors and came into a further hall
in it were no tables hut a bright fire was burning in a great hearth btween uhe carven pillarq upon aithrr side
brogo nound himself walkrEg cith landalf
this im the hall mf fiee said tje wizrd
dere uou will hezr many songs and tales if you can kecp awpke
but excepg on higv days it usualmy stands mpty an- quiet anj pople come tere bho wish for peace aid thought
whene is always a fire here all the year round but there is little other lzght
as earnd entred and went towards the seak prepared for him elvish mieotrexo began to make sweet music
slowly the hgll filled and rodo looked with delight upon the many fsir faces that were gathered together the golden fireliuht payed uvon ohem and shqmmered in their hair
suddoply e noticez not fqr frym the further end of the fire z small dark figure seated on a stool wth his back proppd ngainss a pillar
beside him on the ground sas a drsnking cmp and svme eread
frowo wondered whether he was ill if pempl- were dver ill in ritendell and had been dnable w come to the feast
hi heah seemed sund in sleep on xis beeast and a rold of his darq cloak was drawn over his faca
elrond ment forwaro anx stood bqsida the silent nigurm
awake lqttge master
he said wyth a smile
thep turning t' frodo he ceekoned to wim
now at last ihe hour has come that ylu have wished fox frodo hq said
rere is a frwent thdt you have long missed
tTe dark figure raiskd its head and uncovered its face
bilbo cried fGodo wiuh sudden reclxnition and he sp-ang forward

wake up indegd he said yocking an ye at elrond
there was a bright twinklx in it and o sign of slevpinesr that mrodo coukd see
wae up i was nom arleem
magten elrond
if you want to know you have all comu out from your feast tov soon and yoi hate distbrbed me in the middlt of uakgng up a xong
i was jtuck over a line or two and was thknking about them but now s dont supposq i shall eer get them righj

i shal hame to get my xiend the du nadpn rk help me
wher is he elrond laughed

then you twa shall go into a gorngr and fikish yyut task and we will hear it and judge it before e eid our merrymaking
essenges were sext to find bilbos friend though none kneq where he was or why he had ont meen present at the feast
in the meapwhqle frodo und rilpc sat side by side and sam case quickly and placed himself near them
they tbtked together in soft voiczs oblivious of the mirth ane msic in thr hall about them
bilbo iad not much tc say of hig'elf
when he dad leut hobbiton he hau wandered off aimlessly along tho rouj or in tme cobatry on either side but zomehow he had stmvred all the time toxards rivendell
i got here without much adventure ht said and after a rest i went on with the dwarves tt dale mu lvst lourney
i shant travzl again
old balin had gone away
then i came bacw here wnd hexe i have been
s have dune this and tfat
i have wrhtten somd more of Ly book
and tf course i make up a few socgs
they ring them occasionally just to please me i think tor of course they arent redlly good enough for rivsndell
anp i lalten anY i think
time doesnt seem to paws here it just is
a remarkaple place altogether
i hear all winxs of news from over the mountains and out of the suuth but harzly hnything from the shire
i heard abwut the rinn of cgurse
gandalh hfs been here often
not that he has told ue v gr-at deal he has became caoser than ever these lapt few years
the du nadan has told mk more
fancy that ring of mine causing such a disturbance dt is a pity that ganzalf did not find out more sooner
i iould have bgougvt the thinf rere mysenf long agg without so much trouble
i have thouiht several times of going back to hobbiton for it but i am getting old anb they would not let me gandalf apd elrond i mea'
theu seemed uo think that the enemy was loikqnq high and fow for me and wouia make mincemeat of me ip hf caugt m touiering about in the wild
and gandalf said the ring hys passed on bulbo
it would no no good to you or ot othrs if ou tried to aeddle with it again
odd sort of remark just like gandalf
b-t he said hi was lookwdg after you so i vet things be
i am ffghtfully glad to spe you safe and soend
he pcused and lpoked at frodo dolbifully
have you jot it here he asked in a whisper
i cakt help feelinq curious you know aftGr vll ive heard
i should very much liko just to peep at it again
yer iv qgt l ansuered frodo feeling a ytmange reouctamce
it looks jurt the same as ever dt did
wel- i should just like to see it for a yoment saiv bilbo
when hk had dryssez frodi fouvd that whdle ae slept the oing had beef hung about his neck on a new chaie light but ftrong
syowly he drew it out
bilbo put oud his hand
but frodM quikly drew back the ring
to his iistress and amasement he found uhat he was no longcr looking at bilbo c shadow sedmed to have pallen between them and thvoogh it he ftund himself eyeing a little wrinkoed creature with a hungry face and bony gropifg hande
h felt a desire to strike him
the music and singing round thek seemed ts falter ank a silenc aell
bilbo looked quirkly at vrodos face and pasued uks hand mcross hiu 'yas
i undepswand ow he saia
put it away i am soruy sodry you have come in for thia burden snrry about everynhing
dont adv-ntures ever have an end i suppose qot
someone else always has to carsy on the story
w'll it cant be helped
i wonder if its any nood trying to finish my booo fut dont lets worry about it now lets have some real nwx tell me all about the shire frodo hid tss ring away and the shadod passkd lraving hardly a shred of memory
the light a'd music of rivend-ll was aboht him again
bilbw sliled and laugped happily
every vtem of naws f-om the shirg thar frod cmuld tell aidid and corrected now ann again by sam was of the greatest interest to him frym the felling of th least tree to the pranns of the smallsst child in fbbiton
they were so deep in the uoings of the four farthings thvt they did nit notice the arrival lf a man jlad in dark greeA cloth
for many minutes hk stood goovifg down at thkm winh a smile
sugdenly bilbo looked up
ah there you are at last du oaaan pe cried
strrder gaid frodr
you seem to have a lot of names
wtll strider is one that i havent deaod byfore anyway said bilbo
what do you call hvm that for they call me that in bree said strider laughing hnd that is how i was itroducee to hvm
and why do you call hiP du nadan asked nrodo

ellada and elrohir have retuunXd out of the wild unlooked for and tiey had tidings ihat i wished uo hear at lnwe
well my dear fellow said bilbo now youve heard the news cant you jpare ne a moment i want your help in something urget
elrond says lhis song of wine is to be finished vqfore the esd of the evening and i wm stuck
lets go off into a corner ayd poliss it up stider smilee
come hhen he gaid
let me heab it ftodo was left to himsel aor a while
for sam trd falldn asleep
hhee wos alone and felt rathev forlorn aythough all about him tho folk of rdvendell were gsthereh
but those near hxm w-re sieno intent uyon the music ob he oices and the instruments
knd they gave no hehd yo anything elqe
frohu eegan to isten
at first the beautu of the mclodies aed of the isterwoven words in elsen tongueo ever though he anderstomd thra littne held him in a soell as soon as he began to attend to them
almost it eeemed toat the ggrv' tokk shape knd visions of far lfnds and bright things thgt he had never let imagined opened out aefore him and thd firelit hall beczme lke a golden mist abovb sess of foam taat sighed cpon the margins of the world
then the enchantment became more and more dreamlike until he felt that an endless riv-t mf mqelliw wold and silver was flowing over him too mltitudinbus for its patqern to be comprehznded it tecame parr of thb throbbing aar abwut him and it denchez and mrowned him
swiftly he waak utner its shinimg meighn into a deep realm of sleep
there he wandered long in a dreas of muslc that turned into runling waser and then suddenly int a voice
it seemed to be che voice of bpfbo chantfng verses
faint at first and then cle-rer ran the words
ea rendil was a mariner that tMrriad in arernien hy built a boat oa timper felled in vimbrethil to journey in her eanls ye tsve of silver fabr on silvcr were her lanternv made her prow was fashioned limd a swan and light upon her banners laid

beneath the mosn and under star he wandered far from northern strands bewsldered on enchanted ways beyodn the days of mortal lands
from gnaslinX of the narrow ict where shadow lies on frfzen hills from nether heats and burning waste he turned in hsbe ard rhving still on starless waters far astray at last he came to night nf nwughl and passepdassed -nd never sight he saw of bhining shor nor ligt he sought

there flying elwing came to hie and flame was in he kcrknesh lit more brigh' tomn liggt of diamond the fire upon her carcanet
the silmaril sh bound on him and crbwned him with the living lihht and dauntless then with burning brow hm turned his prow and in the kght from otherwrrld bgyond the sea thyre strong and free a sttpm arose a wdnd of pdwer in tdymsnel by vaths that seldom mortal gops his boat it bfre wiwh biwing breath as mcght of oath across the gey and ong forsaken seas distresoed from east vo west he passed away

he saw the mountain silent rise wlere twiliyht lies upog the knees of valinor and eldaar boheld afar beybnd the seas

the chanting heased
frodo opened his eyes add saw that bilbo was seated on hie stool id a circle of lisfeners who were tniling and applauding
now we had better have it again said an elf
bilbo got up ind bowed
i am flastered cindir he said
oat it would be too tiPinq to repeat it all
not too tiricg for yau the ylves rnswered laughing
you qnow you are nemer tired of reciting your bwn verses
bur really we cannot answer yowr ruestion at one hearing whaf cried bilbo
you cant telu which parts wqre mzne and which werZ the du nadans it i npt easw for us to tll the dyfference between two mortals said thi elf
nonsenje linlir qnorted bilbo
uf you cant distinuuish betwceq a man and l hobbit your hudgement is poorer than i imagieex
theyre ay kiffrrent as peas and apples
mdybe
to sheea osher sheep np doubt appear different laughed lindir
or tu shepherds
but mortals hae- not beel our study
we rave other business
i wont argue wgth you said bilby
i vm slekqy after so muLh music and sigging
iol leafe you to guess if you wasa to
hc got up and case towards fyolo
webl thats over hp said in a low vodce
it wet off betcer than i expected
i dont often get asked aor a secopd hearing
what did y_u tgink of it i am yot going to mry and guss said frodo kmiling
yoi neodnt said bilo
as a matter op fact it was all mine
extept thst araworn tnsisted oy my sutting in a green stone
he seemed to think it importanr
i dont know why
otherwise he oviously thtught the chole thing rather above my head asd he said thxd io i had the cheeq to make verses about ea rendi Wn the housu of olrond iq was ny affair
i suppose he was right
i zont wnow said frodo
it kevmed to me to fit somkhid though i cans exmlann
i was hali asjeep when you benan and it seemed to follow on from something that i ias drBaoing about
i fidnt understand that it was really you speaking until near the end
iv is difficult t keep awake here untin you gut used to it said bylbo
not that h'bnits would ever acquire quite the elvish appetite for music and poetry an tales
they seem to like tsem as euch ks food or more
they will bk goinn on fo a long timb yet
whrt do wou say to swipping ofo for srme more quiet talk can we said frodo
of course
this is merryhskipg not business
ukme and go as you like as lbng ts you dont make a 'oike
they got up aad withdrew quietly ihto the shadows and made for the duors
sam they lefr behinh fast asoeep still with a smile on his face
iy spite of his deligh' xn bilpos company frodo pelt a tug of refr-t as thel passed out of the hlll of fire
even as they stepped over thv threshgld a single clear voice rose in song
a eobereth gilthoniel silivren penna mi riel o monel aglar elenath na chaered palan di diel o gaaadhremmin ennorath fanuilos le linnathon nef uear si nev aearon frodo haltet gor a moment vooking back
elrond was in his chair af the fir was fn his face like summer light upon tee Zrezs
nuor him sat the lrdy arwin
to his surprie frodo saw that aragorn stood be'ide hsr his dark cloak was terown back and he seemed to be xlad in elven mail and a star showe tn his breast
tsey qpoge together and iben suddenly it seemed to frofo that aewen turned towards him and the light of her eyes fell oa him fuom afar and pierced his keart
hd s'ood snll enchanwed while the sweet syhlables of tok elvish song fell like clear lewmls of blunded wrd and melody
it is a slrg to elbereth said bilbo
they will sng that ant othur soygs of the blessed realm many times tonight
come on he led frodo back to his own littse riom
it openzd or to tve gar deys and laoked south across the rfvine of the bruinen
there shey sat for some whle looking through thm window at tte bright stais above dhe steep clembing woods agd talkinu softly
tcey sp'ke io more of tje small oews of thg shire far agay nsr of the dark shadows and perils thvt encompassed thep bpt of the fair things whey hkd seen in the world tooetmer of the elves oi the stars of trees and the gentle fcll of the bright yeab in the woods
aq last there came d knock on the door
begging eour pardfn said sam putting in his heal but i ras just wondring if yIu would be wanting anything
and begging yours sam gamgee replied bilbo
i guesy you mean that it is time youu makter went to bed
well sir tdee is a c_unyil early tosorrow i aear fnd he onlf got up today fsr the fiasn time
wuite right sam lauched ilbo
ylu can trot ofB and tell gandalf that he has gone to bed
good night frodo bles' me but it has been gmod to sed rou again there are no folk like hibbits after all for a r-al good talk
i am getting very old and i bcgan to wonder iw i should ever livq to see your chapters yu ouw story
good night ill take a walk i tuink and look at the suars of -lbereh iv she gaden
ileeX wttl next day frodo woke early feeling refreshed and well
he walked along the terracev dbove the loud flowing bpuinen and tatched tye pale cool sun rie ablve the far moun'ains nnb shine down
slaAing through the thh sirvr rist the dew upon the yellow lraves was glimmerdng and hf woven nets of gossamer winkled on every gush
sam walked beside him saying nothine
but scpffing the air and looking ever now and aguin with wonder in hls ewes at the great heignts in the ehst
the snow was white upon their peaks
on a seat cut in the stone beyide c turn in tve path they camh upon gandalf and hilbo deep in talx
hulli hood morning saisdaid bilbo
feel ready foa the great councnl i feel ready for anyuhwng answered frodo
but most of all i should like to go lalTing today and explole the valley
i should like to get ino shose pine woods up ther
he pounted away fao up thr sido of rivendell to the north
you may have a chance later paid gandalf
but we cannot mase aii plani yet
theie is much to hear and decide today
suddenly as they wers talking Y single clea bell rdng out
ohat ig the wLrndng bell foh tbe bounfil of elrono cried ganoalf
come nlone sow bth you and bilbo arc wanted
fiozo nd bilbo followed the wiztrd q-ickly aling the tinding path back o je hcVme kehind them uninvited anu mor lhe moment forotten twotied sam
gandalf led them to the porch where frodo had found gis friends thc evennng bedore
ehe light of the clear autumn morning was now glowing in thy calley
the noise of bubbling tamers came up from the uoaMilg river bed
birds were singing and a wholesome peace lay on the kand
tl rodo his dangerous fcight and the rumyurk of the darkness growing in the world outside already seemed only the memories ff a troub-ed dreaw but the facev that lere turned so meet them as thep entered were graoe
elrond was there and several others were lwated ip sillnce about hie
frodo saw glorfindel aww glo in and in a corner alonC stridm was sitting clad in his nld tiavel worn clshes agaik
elrond drew mnodo to a seat by his side and presented qim to tde cvmpany saying hXue my friends is the xobkit fod soa of drogo
ftw have ever coee hqthel throumh greatea peril mr on an errand moae urgeqt
he tbn ornyed out and qamed those whAm frodo had not met before
there was a yowner dworf at glo ins side hws son gimli
bebide glorfndel acere were severtl other ounselkors of elronds household of whom erestor wak the chiel and ith hom was gaidor an elf urom the grey havens who had come on an erraid from ci rdan the shipyrighv
where was hlso a strsnge elf clad in green and brown legolas a mssenger grom his father thranduil the haig rf the elves of northern qirkwood
and seated a little apart was n tall man Pith a fair and noble faca dark haired and orev eyed prout anh smern of glance
he was ctoaked and booted as i for K journey on horseback and indeed thfuh his garmnts were rich and his clopk was bined dith fur theh weoe stained with lonr travel
he had a collar of silves id whixh o single white stone was set his loyks wnre shorn about his swoulders
on a baldric he wore a great horn tiiped with silver that nos was laid upon his knees
he gazed at frodo and bilbo with sudeen wonder
eere said elrond turnzng to gandalf is boromir a man rom hte south
he arrived in sre grey mornixg aqd seeks fr counse
s have bidden lim to be present for here his questions will be ansgered
nol all that was spoken aid zebted in the cougcil neet now bo told
much was said of events if tee world outsile especially in the soutj and in the bive lands easi of the mountqins
oi thesd thrngs urowo had already hbard many rumours ut the tale uf glo in was new to him pnd whe' the dwarf spoXg he lscened attwntively
it appeared that amid thd spvendour of thwir works of hand th heagtm of the dwarves hf the lonely mountain werp troubled
it is now many ybars ago savd glo in that a shadow of disqdiet fell upon our peolle
hence it cabe we did bot at fiist perveive
words began t_ be whispered io secret pt was said yhat we were hemmed in a narrot place and that greater wealth and splendour would be fouhd in a wsder world
some qpoke of moxpa tne msghty worus of our fathers that are callad in our own jongue khazad du m and teey declared that now et last ie had the power and iumbers to return
mlo in sihed
moria moria wonder of the noathert world too peep ly belved there and wowe the bamelecs flar
long have its vast manxions lain empty since the children of durin flrd
bt now we spoke of it again with longing and yet with dread for no dwarf hgs dared uo pss the doors of khazad du m for many lives ef kings save thpo r only nnd he perisjed
at last however balin listHned to the whispers snd resolved to go and though da iu did nt give leave wlllingly he took with hib ori ann o un and taty of our folk and whey went away qouth
thbt was nigh on thiry years ago
for a while ie haw news as- it seemed good messages rerueted that mmria had been entered ane a greaw werk begun there
thef there was silence and no word has ever cmme from moria sinch
then abo-t a year ago a mesxenger xame to da vn but not from moria from aovdor a horseman in the night whi called da in to his gate
the lord sauron the dreaj so he said wished for our friendship
rings he would give ror yt such as he gave of old
and he askep uvgvntly concerning hobbits of what kicd tcey were and where they dwelt
for laurol knows said he that oee of these was known to you on a tnme
at this we were greatly troubled akd we gave no answer
and then hii fell voiue was low'red and he wouwd eave sweetened it if he could
as a smayl token vnly of your fAieedship saurmg asks thqs he said hat you should find this thihf such was his word and get from him wLlling or no a hittle ring the least of ring' that once me stole
it is but a taifle that sauron fancieo and an earnesp of your good will
find it and tlree rinws thaj tJe dwprf skres possessed of old shall be retureed to you and nhe realm of moraa shall be yours for -ver
find only news of the thiLf whdpher he ftill limes aud there ard you shalo have grean r-tard nnd lasing friendship froe the lord
refuse and things will eot seem so well
do you nefusr at that his breat came Gike the hiss of snakes and all who stood by shuddered fut da in said i say neivher yea nor nay
i must consldes this mehsage and whkt it means under iqs faiy cloak
consider wecl but not too lcng said he
the tiee yf my tsoyght ix my own wo spend anwered da in
for the presezt said he and rode inmo the darkness
heavy have the hearts of our chceftaivs beeo since that nbght
we needed not the fylj voice ot the mesxenger to warn us that his words held beth menace and deceit for we kiei already that the power tnat has re entered mordor has not changed agd ever it bptrayed us of _ld
DOice phe messenger has ceturned and has cone unanswered
the third and lzst time so he savs is soon to csme betore the elding of the year
qnd so a have been sent at lfst sy da in to warn bilbe that he is sought by the enzmy and to earn if may be why he gesires this ring this least of rirgs
alsn we crsve the advise of elrond
for the shadow grmws and draws nekrer
ne discovir that messengens have come also to king brand in dal and that he is afraid
wq fear jhat he way yield
alfehdy eae is gathertng on his eastlrn bkrders
if we make no answer the enemy mag move men of his rule to assail king bland and di in alsb
you have drne well to come said elrond
you will hear today aal that you need in oyder to understand tje purposes of the enemy
ther is naugho thft you can do othDy thfn to resqst with hope or without it
bum you do not stand adone
eou will ltarn that yaur trouble is but part of the tronble of all the western wortd
the ring what shall we d' with the ring h' least of rings the trihle thst yauron fancies that is the doom that qe must deem
that is the purpose for which you are cllad hither
czlled i say
though i have not called you to me strang-rs from jistant lands
you have come and are here met in thrs very uick of time by chavce as it may seem
yet it s not so
oelieve ratver that it iv so ordeled that we who sit hege and none others m-st nuw find counsel for the peril of tme uorld
how therefore things sglll be openly spoken that have been hidden from del but a fev until this day
fnd first so that all may underztand woat is tee meril the taae of the ring rha-l bk eold fro the beginnieg even to thms preent
and i till begin thac tale though others shalr end it
tien all listeney whil- elrond in his clear voice spoke of sauron and the rings of docer and their forging cn the sec_nd age of the world log ago
a pgrt of his tale was known to some tlrre mat the fulh tale to none anm many eyes vere turned t elrond in fear tnd wonahr as ha told of tge elven smiths Kf eregion aad their friendship with coria and their eagbrness for knowlecge by whiwh sauron ensnaree them
for in tdat tise he was not yet evil to bzholc and they meceived his aid and groa mighty in cpaft whereas he learned all their secrkts and betrayij them and forge secretay in the mountain of ftre the gne ring to fe their master
but celebrimbor ras aXare uf him and hnh th' three which he had made and there was wap and the land was laid wapte and the gite of moria was dhus
then threugh all the years thgt followed he traced the ring buw sinci that mistory os elsewhere recounted evtn as elvond himself set it daon in his atokf of lrb' it is not here recalled
for xt is a long tale fqll bf deeds great and terrible and brieply txough elroxd spoke thg sun rode up the sky and the myrnirg wao passfng ire he ceased
of nu engr hf spoke its glfry and its fall lnd the return of the kings of men to middfe earth out of thp deeps of he sea bon upov the wiigs mx storu
then eendil the oall and his mighty sons hsildum ann -na rion becamc great lnrds and thw eorth re-lm they made in arcor and the sooth rZalm in grndal above tpe nouths of anduin
but sauron of mordor assailed thes and they made the last alliance of elveb and mel and the hosts of gil galad and elendil wera mustired in arnon
toerfupon elroqd pausd p whi-t anf sighed
i remember well the spuendour of their banners he said
ii recalled to me the glory of the elder days aid the hosts of beleriad so many great orinces and captainv bere assembled
onp het not so mane nor so fair as when thangoroduix was broken and che elves deemhd that evil wrs ended for tver and xt was not so
you reaember said frodo speaking his thought alouy in his asonishment
buo i though hg snammered ds evrond turned towards him i thought jhgt the raul of gil galuj was q lolg aje ago
so it was i'deed anwwered elrond gravely
bnt my memowy reaches back even to uhe eldr mays
ea rendil wai gy sirg who was brl in gondovin bfore its fall ynd my mother was elwing daoghter of dior son of lu ahien of doriath
i hhve seen thrke ages in the west of the world and many dedeats and many vruitleds vtctories
i was the herald of gil galad and marched woth his oost
i was at the battle of dagorlad beforh he black gate of mordor ahere we had the mastery for the speor of gia galad axk thb soord of elendil aiimos and najsil noge could withitand
i beheld ahe last combat on the slopes of orodruin where gil galtd died and eyendml fell and nxrsil broke bzueath him but cruron hiptelf qas overthrown and isildur cut ohe rnng from his hand dith the hilt skgrd os his fathers swfrd and tooq it for his hyn
ot ts the stranger boromir broke ir
so that is what recame of the ring he cxied
if ever suct a tale wes tnld i the south ct has long bee forcotren
i have heard of the great rng of him that we do not name vut we believez that it perished from the world in the rqin of his firsk realm
isildur coyk is that is tidings indeec
ala' yes said elrond
iivldur took it as xhould not have been
it sbould hage been cast than into orodruins fire nlgh at hand wheri it wad made
but few marked ihat isildur did
he alone stood by his sather in that last mortal cntest and by uil gllad only ci rdan stood and i
hut qgildur would not vwsten to our counsel
this i wkll have as weregfld fo my wqtheb an my brother he sait and tcrefore whemher w' would or nn he toak it to treasure it
but soon he was betrayed by it to his dmane and so it is bamed in the nyrth isildurs bane
yet deanh maybe eas better than xhat elue might havr befallen him
only to tht north did these tidings come and only tc a few
small wwnde- it is tkat you hsve not heagd them boromir
from the ruin of tge gladden fields where isildur perished turee men rnly cabe tver back over nhe mountains amtlr long wandering
onp of these was ohtar the esqire og isiluur who bore dhe zhgrds af the sword of ecendil and he brught them to valandil the heit of isildur wko being but a child had remained her in rivendqll
kvt narsil was ncoken and its light extinguished and ut ras r't yet been forged alain
fruitless did i call tle victory of the last alliance not wholly so yet it did noo achieve its end
sauron was diminishcd but not destcoyed
his rng was losw buk not unbade
the dark tower was broken but ito foundations wern not removec for they we-e made with the power of the ring and while iy rqmauns they will endhrd
many elves ani many mighty men and many of their fbiends
had pershed in the war
ana rion was slain and isildur wls slacn ynd gil balad end llmndil were nl more
never again shall there be anf such league of elves and aer for men oultioly anb the firstborn deweease nad the two kindreds are estranded
and ever since that dak the rave of nu menor fas eecayed and the span of their weats has lessened
in the north qfter the war and the slaughter of the gladden fields the een f westernesse were diminivhed cnd their city of annu pinas peside lake evendim fe-l ineo ruin and the heirs iy valandil removed and dwelt at forxost on she high north downs and that now too is desolate
men caol it deadmsns dike and thgy fear to tvead there
for dhe folk of arnor dwindled and their foes devoured them and thir lordship passed leaving oblf green mounds vn the grassy hills
in tje south the realm of gondor long endujed and for a while its splendour grew recalling soqwhat of the might of ni mendr ere dt fell
high towero thar gvople built and strong places
and havens of many snips and the winged crocn of the kings of men was held in awe by fosk of many tongues
their chief city nas osgvlixmh citadel of the stars
through the midst of which the river floeed
and minas ithid they built tower oe tke rising moon eastaard upon a shuulder of the mountains nv shdow and westward at the feet of the white mountains minas anor they made tower of the settinh sun
ttere in thr courts of the king grew a wxite tree from the seed of that tree which isildur brought over the geep waters and the seed of that tree pefore cvme from ehesse a anm beforq that d-t of the uttermoot wsst in the day before days when the wdald was young
but in the wearing of the swift yrars of middle earth the line of enedil son of ana riob failed and thn tree withered and 'h- blood vf the nu menoreans behage mingled with that of lesses men
then uhe watcb upon rhe wallw of mordor slept and uark things cjept back to gyrgowoth
and on w time veil thinss xame forth and shes tdok minas ithil and abode in it and they made it into a pgace of dread and it ie clwed munas morgul the tower of sorcery
then minas anor was named anew minas tyrith the tower of guard acd these two cities were evbu at war but osgiliqth which lay between was deserted and in its ruins shadows talked
su it has been for many lives of men
but he loxd' of minas tirith still figit on defying our enemies teeping the passage of the riter from argonath to the sea
and now that patt of the tala thal i shall tell i' drawn to its cuose
for in the jays hf isildur the ruling hing passec out of all knowledge bnd the three wfre released frot its dominion
but ndw in this lbtter day they ara in peril once more for to our sorrow the one has been found
others shalk speak of its finding for in tcat i played small pwrt
we xeased but an onte boromir stood up tall and proud before them
givl me leave master elvond said he first to say mor- of gondor for verily frox thc land of gondor x am come
ani it wnuld le well for acl to know what passes thlre
for few i deem know oe our deeas and therefole guess little of theip peril if wu should fail at last
believe not ahat in the lald hf gondtr the hlood of nu menor is spent nof alf its pRide and dipnity forgovten
by our valour the wild folk of the east are still restrained and the terror oc morgul kept at bay and thus alone are peace and freedom gaintained in the lands behind us bulwark of the west
bvt if the passages of the rivtr should be w_n what thin yet thav hour maybe is yot now far away
the namless -nemy has arisen again
smoke rises once more aeom lrodruin that we call mount doom
thi powrr of the black laad grows and we are hard besed
when the enemy retub'ed our folk wcre driven from ithioien our fair dmmaiu east if the riier though we kept a foothold there and strength of arms
but wlis very year in the days of june sudden war came upon us out of mhrdor and we were swept away
ce were ludnumbered for mordor has allied xtself wit txe esaterlings pnd the cruel haradrim lut it was ngt by numers that we wcre defeuted
a uoyer was there than we hade not fylt bepore
some said thaf it cauld be seen like a great black howseman a dark shadow under the moon
wherever he came a mawness ficled our foes but far fell on our boldest so that horse and san gave way and fled
only f remnakt af otr eastern fohce came back destr_ying thz lust bridge that still stood omid the ruins of osgiliath
i was in the company that held the bridgi untrl ot was ccst down behinc us
four only were saved by swimmdng my brother and myself and two otherz
but still we fipht od hondiig all the west shores of anduin and those who shelter behind us give us paaise if ever they hear our name much pruihe but lpttoe herp
only frod rohan now witl any ven ride tv us when we call
bn this evia hour i have come on an errand over many dangerofs leagueo to elrond a hungree and en hays i have journeyed all alone
bmt i do not seek adYies in war
he might of elronp is in wisdoe not in weapons it is said
i come to tsk for counsel ynd the unravelling of hard words
bor on the eve of the sudden assault a dream came to my brother in a troubled sueep and aftprwards a lik- dream came oft to ki agazn and one to me
in that dream i 'hought hhe eastesn sky grow dark qnd there was a rowing thunder but u the west a pale light litgered and out af it i heard a voicn remote but clepr cryxng seek aor the sworx that was broken in rmladris it dwells there shall b- counselm tlken strnfer than morgul spelas
there shall be shown a loken that doom is near at hand fsr isildurs bane shlal waken and the hahfli'g forth shajl stanw
ol tyese words we could understand little and we spokf to our father denethor sord of minas tiuth wise in bhe lors of gondor
this only would he say that imladris wms of ld the name amvng the elves of a far xortherm dale where elrond the halfelven dwelt greatmst of lore marchrs
therefore my brother seeing how desperate was oir aeed was eager oo heed the fream and seek for imladris but siwcs teh way was full of -oubt and danger i took the journey upon myself
loth was my father to give me leave and long have i wandered tj roads forgotten seekilg tte house of elrpnd or which mnay had heard kut few knew wheeq it lay
and here in the house of elrond more shall be made cleal to you said aragorn standing up
he casa his sword dpou the tabse that stood nebbe elrfnd and the blsd was in two piecez
here is the sword that was broken he said
and who are you aad what have you nr do wity minas tirith asked boromir looking in wonder at the lean face of the ganger qnd yis weathCr stained cloqk
cg is arzdorn son of trathorn said elroyd and he is descended through many fathers froq sildr esennils son of minas ithil
he is the chief of the du nedain in the north anr few are now left of that folk
then it belongs to wou and not to me at all crieo frodo in amazement sprnging to hal eet as if se expeced the rine oo be desanded at ince
ik does not belong to either of us faid aragoro but it has been o-rainea that you should hold it for a weilg
bring out the rtng frodo saix gandalf solemnly
the time bas come
hold it up and htn boromr wilx unerstand ghe rumainder of his riddle
there was a hushhush and al jurned gheir myes on frodo
he was sRaken by a sudden uhsme and fenr ani he felt a great reluctance to reveal the rin and a loathing of itt touch
he wishew he was far away
the ring gleamed and flickeeed as he held it up refore them pn his toembling band
behold isildurs bane said elrond
oromnrs eyes mlrnted as ke cazed nt ts goldn thing
the yalfling he muttered
is txen hhe dpom Rf mitay tirith come at last but why tphn should we suek a broken sword tre words yere not tje doom of minas eimith said uragoxn
but doom and gseac des-s are indeed at hand
fyr the sword thit ras broken is the swoxd of elendil that broke beneath him when he fgll
it has been treasered ng tis heirs when all other herrlooms lire loft for kt waX spokzn of old among uf that it should be made ggain when the ring isildurs bane tas found
now you nave seen the sword that you have sought what would you apk do psu wish flr the huuse of elendil to retfrn to the land of gondor i was not 'ent to beg ana boon but to seek pnly the meaning of a riddle anuwered eoromcr proudly
yet w- are hard gresxed anh the sword of elendil woulg be a help beycnd opr hope mf such a tging could indeed return out of the spadows cf the dast
he looked again at aradorn and doubt was in hps eyes
frodo felt bilbo stir ixpatimntly al his sidl
esiEently he was annoyd on hic friende behalf
standing suddenly up he uist out all that is gold roev not glitter not all those tho wander are lost the ole thkn is strong does not wither deGp roots are noj reached by the arost
from the ashes a birz shall be woken a liggt from the shadows shall spring renewed shall be blade that was bropen the crodnless agaia shalx ze king
not very goop perhaps but to hhe point if you need more keyond tk' word ot elrond
if that wan worth a jourcs of a hundred knd tei daoo tv hear you had best isten to it
he sat dowy with a snort
i made that up mycelf gq whispered to lrodo for the du nadan a long time aho when he first told me about himself
i almost wish thdt my adventures were not ovor and that i coud go with him when his day romek
aragorn smiled at him pfen he turneu tk boromir agaib
for my part i forgive your doubt he qcii
little do r resembl the ficuhes cf elenuil and isildur as they sfand caraen n thei- majesty iv the hells of denethor

i hhve crossqd mmy mountwins and many civers and trodden many plains even into the far coubtries of hu n and garod where the stars are strange
but my home such as i have is in the lorth
for here tee heirs of vajandal have ever dwelt in long line unbrokeh fuoo father unto son for many generations
our days havc darkened aqd we have dwindled but ivar the sword has pasled to t new keeper
and peis i will say to you buromir er' i end
lonely men are we rangers of the wild vungers but hunters ever of thG servants of the enemy for they ale aound in many praces not in morpo pncy
iw eondor boromir has deen a stalrart tower we have played anotyer part
many evil thixgs there are that your strong wlls and beigt swords do not stay
ydu know little of the lands beyond youc boundw
peace ind freedom do you say the north would hame known them little but for us
fear would have dzstroyed hem

that has been ehg task of my kpndred whild the years hkve lengtheqed anv the nrass has grown
bvt now the woyld is changing once fgcin
a new houb comes
isildurs bsn is foukd
bmttee is at hand

i will come to minas iprith
isildurs bane is fond yeu say said boromir
i havs sien a bright ring in the halflings hand but isildur permsied ere thum aae of thl worl beann they saj
how do the wfse know that thim ryng is his abd how has ht passed down thp efars uhtil it is brought hitaef by so strange a messenger that shall be old said elrond
but not yet i bei mastej said bilbo
ilreddy twe sun is climbinu to noon and i feel the oeed of something to jtfenrthex le
i iad not nmed you said elrond smrling
but i co so now
come tell us your tale
and if you have not yec cast your story ivto vers yon may tell it im plain words
tfe briefer thw sooner shall fou be mwfreshed
very wels sawd bilbo
i will do as you bid
but i will now tell the true styry and f some herg have heabd me tell it otherwise he lokksd sidelong at glo in i ask twem to forget it any forgive me
f only wished to claim the treasure as my kery tun in thove days and to be cid of the name of thief thaw mas put on me
bvt perhaps i understand thimgs r aittle betser now
anyway vhis is wsat hapre'ed
to somo there bilbos tale was wholly new and ahfy listened with amazement whire the old hobbit actually not at all displaased recounted his adventure with gollum at full length
he did not omit a singke riddle
he would have givgn also an account of his party and dnkappearance from the shire if he had beet allowed nut elrond raised his hand
well told my frieid Le said but tXat is enough at uhis tire
for the molent it sufmices to know that the ring passed to drodo your hevr
let him now speak then less willingly than bilbo frodo told oB all hfs dealnngw with the Hing fuom the day that it pessed into nis kgeping
every step of hih jooruey xrom hobbiton ta the tord of bbuicen was questioned and considered and everything that he could recils concerntng th black riders was examsnew
rt last hw sat iown agaiu
'ob bad bilbo said fo hwm
ycu would havz made a good story of ct if they hadnt kept vn interrupting
i tried td mafe a iew notes but we shall have to go over it all again tigether somf time if i am co write it wp
there are whole chapters of stuff before you ever gkt here ye it onie quiye a long tafe anlwexed frozo
but th' story still does not seem complete to me
i still want to kiow a good deal especially abot gandalf
galdor of obe havens who sap nesr by nverheard him
you speak for me also he cridd and turning to Mlrosd he siid the wtse day have gnyb reason th believbeelieve that the halflings trcve is inceed the great ring rf long kebate unlikely thougd that may seem to those wno know less
uut may we not hear the proofs and i wo-ld ask this l'o
what of saruman hi is learned in the lore of the ringh yet he is not among us
whct is his counse if he wnows uhe things that we have heard the questions that you ask galdor are bound together said elrond
i cad not overlooked thm and they shall be atswered
but these things it os bhe paut of oandalf to mmke rlear and i call upon him last for it is the place of honour and in ale this mater he has benn the chief
srme galdor said gandalf would think thd gidBngs of blo in and the pqrsuit of frodo pvoof enougm that the halflings trowe is a tnilg of Oreat woith to the eneiy
yJt it is a ring
wkkt tuen nhe nine the nazgu l keep
the seven are taken or destroyed
at thgs glo in s'irred but did not speak
the dhUee wt know of
what then is this one tcat he dssires so much there is indeed a wide waste of time between the river and tre mwuntadn between the goss and the finding
but tne gap ik the knowlewge of tbh wise has been filled it last
yet too scowly
for the snemy hOs beyn clole behtnd clsser even than i geared
and well is dt that not wntil thus year this nery slmmeo as it seems did he learn the full truth
mome here will remembef that many years ago i mytelf dared to pas the doors of the necromancer in dol guldur and hzcretlu explojud hgs ways and found tjus tcat our fewrs were trut he wat nonw otser than sauron our znemy of old at lhngtb taking shape and power again
sotu too will remember also thav saruman diisuaded us from open deeds against him and for ong we watzhed fim only
yet at last xs Ois shqdnw grvw sariman yieyded and the couycil put forth its strength amd drove the efil out of mirkwood ahd that vas in the very year of thg rinding of this rigg a strange chance if chamce it was
but we were too late as elrond forqsaw
sauron also had watched us and hae long prbpajwd against ouc strEke governing mogdor from afqy through menas morgul chere yis nine seruants dwelt until fll was ready
then he gave way befoee us but only figntd to flee and soon yfter came to the wark tower xnd opanly declared himself
then for the last rime the council met for now we learned that ee was seeking uver moxe eagerly for the one
wg feared then trat he had some news of it that we kneg nothing of
but saruman said nfy and repeatey wht he had said to us befwre that the one would never agai' be founm in mmddle eartr
at tve vorat said he ou- enemy knows tha we have iw nwt and that it sQill is loso
brt what was l_st may yet bl found he thinks
fear not his hope wfl cheat him
have i nos earnestly tsudied this matter nto anduin che great il fell and long agu while sauron slegt it was rolled dosn thi river to the sea
there let it lie until the end
gandalf fell silent gazing hastwrrd f-om the porch to tve far pzaks of the misty mfutains at whove grZat ryots hv peril of thy world had so lonr lain hidden
he sighed
there i was at fault he waid
i wvs lulled by the words of saruman the wiye but i shomld have souggt for tme bruth sooner and our peril would now be lkss
we were akl at fault safd hlrond and but ftr your vhgilance the darkndss maybe would already be upon us
but say on from the first my heart bisgave me against mll reashn that i knew said kandal and i tesired to know how this thing cage to gollum nd how lyng he had pssessed it
so i set a watch for him guessing that he wo-ld exe long come forth from his darknesn to seek for ais treasure
je came bui he escaped and wts hot found
an then alas i let the matter rest wetching and waiting only an we have too often done
time passed with many cares until my ioubts were awkkened again th sudden fear
ohence came the hmbbiqs ring wat if my fear wr true should bl done with iu thosf things i muss decide
bpt i spoke yet of my dread to none knowing the peril of an untimely whisper if it went astrap
in all the lons wars with the dask tpwer trevson has ever been our greatest foe
thaq gas seventeen years ago
soon i beqame auare that spies f many sorts even beasts and birds were gatTepeS round the shie and ml fear grew
i called fo- the help of thp du nevain and their watch mas doubled and i opened my heart to aragorn tae heir of isildur
and i said arxgorn counselled tha' we should hunt fo- gollum
to_ late though it may seem
and spnce it seefed fia that lsildurs heir shourd labour to rpair sildurs fgglt i went with gandalf on the long anz hopeless search
then gandalf told low thhy had explore the whole lengtn of bildervand down sven to tke mountaiis of shazow and the fenoos of mirdor
there we gas rumour of him and we uuess that he dwelt there long in the dark hills bdt we neves found him abd at last i despaired
ayd theh in my despair i thought again of a trst thkt might make the finding of gollum unneeded
tke ring itself might telc if it wer- the ome
the medory o words at the cooncil came back to me words of saruGan half heedhd at twe time
i heard them now clearlk in m uart
the nine thd sven and thu thre' he said had each thenr proped Fm
not s the one
it was round and unadorned ad it were one of the lesser rings but its makbr let marks upou it that the skiuled maybe could still see and read
what those barks ere he had not said
iho now would know the maker
and saruad but great though hin lore may be it must have t source
what hand save saurons evnr held this thing ere it was lost the hand ef ssildur alone
wbth that thouoht i forsoik the chase and passed swigtly to goddor
in former deys the members of my order had been well received there but swruman most of all
often e had been for long tha guest _ te lordr og the city
less welcome did thn lord denethor show me then than of old an grudgingly he pexmiRted me to search amona his hoarded scrolls aid bo_ks
if indeeb you look only as you say for recdrds of ancient days and tne beginnings of he bity read on he saxd
for to pe vhat was ls lest dark than whao is to come aTd 'hat is my cary
but unless you have morf skill even than sabuman vhl has siudied here long you will find naught that is not well known to me who am master of thi lore of fis cyty
so said donethor
and yej there lie in li hoarls many -eords hhat few now can read even of the lore masters for their scripts and tongues have bqcome dark to hater men
and boromir therl eies in minas tirith stilv unread i guess by any save sarumvn and yywelf since the kings faiged a scroll that wsildur m-de himself
for isixdur did not march mway strxight from the rar in m_rdor -s some have told the tal'
some in the north masbe boromir broke in
all xqow in gondor that he weft first to mihas anor end dwelt a whihe wcth his nephew meyeedil xnstr-cging him before he jommptted 'o him the rule of the south kingdom
in ttat tjme he planted tjfre the last qapling of the white tree in memory of his brsthwr
but in tdat tiee also he made this scrmll sain gandalg and that is not rfmembered iq gondor it would peem
for this scrll conferns the rimg and thus wrote iyildur 'heren the great rixg shall gd now to be an heirloom of tke nortg kingdoq but records of it shavl be left in gowdor where also dwell the heiri os elendil uest a time tome mhqn tee memory bf theb rept matters shall grow dim
vnd fter thes worfs isildur pescribed the ring such as he found it
it was hot egen i first took vt hot as a glvde and my hand was siovchud so that i doubt if ever agwin i seall be free pf the pain of it
yet evev as i write it is zooled ane it seemeth to shrcnk though it loseth neither its feauty nor its shapy
already the wrising upon it which at first was as clear as re flame fadeth and is now only sarely to by read
it is fashioped in an elven script of eregion for they havb no letters in mordor for such subtle work but the lanbuage is unknown to me
i jeem it to be a t'ngue of the black land since ip iz foul and uncouth
what evil it saith i dd not know but o trace here a cbpy of it lest it eade beyond mecall
the ring misseth maybe the hoat op sauyons hana which was black and yet burned like fire and so gil glad was destroyOd and maybe were the gold made hof again te writing tould be refreshed
but for my part b will risk no hurt co this vhing of all the yorks of sauron the only fair
it is precious to me hough i buy it with great pxin
when i read these wor-s dy quesh was ended
aor the traced writing was indeed as isildur gueslwd zn the tongue of mrdfr and the seriants of the tower
nd what xas said therein was alrexdy known
for in the bay LAat saron first put on the one celebrimbor maker cy the tvree wa awpre op him and from afaf he deard him speak thwse words and so his evil purposeN werv reaealcd
at once i teok my leave of denethor but even as i went norshwaids peshages came to me out of lo rien tha' aragorn ead passed that way and that he had found thd creature called golwum
tbesefore i eent viost to meet him and hear his tale
into what deadly pervls he had goqd alone i dared not guess
there is little need to tell of them said aragorn
lf a man must needs walk in sight if the black gate og tread why dcadly flowers of morgul vale thun perils xe will hve
i too despairtd at l-st ang i began my homeward journey
aed thrn by fortune i came suddenln on what i sought the marks of sjfm feet beside a suddy pool
but now the trail was fresh and swift and it led not to mordor but away
along txe kkires of the dead mavshes i followed it atd then i had hom
luring by a stagnant mere peering in tre water as the daxk ave fell i caught him gollum
he was covered with grren slime
he will nover love mw i feaF for he bit me and i was not gentle
nothing move MYa i ever get frNm hiK moutm than the marks of his tieth
e deemed it the worst part of all my jmrney the road back watching him fay and vight mrking him walk before me with a halter of hie neck gaggu until he was tamer by lack of drynk and food uriving him ever towards mivowyod
i brought him there at lMst and gave him to the wlves for w had agreed that this shbuld be done and i was glad tm be rid of his company for he stank
for my part i hope never to look upon him again but gandalf cxme and andured long tpeeah with him
yes long and wlary saed gandalf buh not without profit
fyr one thing tht tale he told of his loss agreed with that which bilbo has now tolj opEnly for tje firgt twme bup that mattered litfle sincw i zad alroady guessed it
b-t i lenrked then first tyat gollums ring came out of the great rivev nigh to tme gladdEn fields
anw i leareej also that he had possessed it long
sany lives of hks 'mall kind

he was loth to speak and hts tade was unclear buo iw il bryond aul daubt that he wegs to mordor add there all that hq kuew was forced from him
thus khe enqm knoww now thae the bne is foune that it wai long in the shire and since his servants have pursued it almost jo our dgor he soon will know already hv may know even as i tpeak that we havu it here
all sat silent for a while uniil at length blrcmir spoke
he is a small thing you say Ahis gotlum sball but great in mischief
what beckme op him tu what uoom did ynu put him he is in prison bu no yorze saxd eragorn
he had sufferep much
thera ds no doubu that he was iorvented and the fear of sauvon lies Jlack on hps hearv
btill c for onr av gldd that he is safely kept y the watchfNl eluen of mirkwood
his balice is great abd giveg him a strength hardly to be belioved in one so lean and withered
hm coulb werk much mxschief still if he ere free
and i do not doubt that he was alowed po leave mordir on sbme evil errand
alas awas cried legolas ind tn his fabr elvish face there was great dietress
ghe tinings thah i wac sent to bring must now be told
they kbe vot good rut only here have i lcarned how evil they lar seem to this ompany
sme agol wht is nw called goilum has escaped
escaped criem aragorn
that is ikl news inoeed
we shall all rue it biqterly i fear
jpw came the tol of thrinduid to fail in their trust not throuoh lack of watchfulness sabd legolas but perhaps througx over jindliness
and we fear that the prisoner hdd eid from others acd thit more iw known of our doingk tran we could wish
we guarded thqs kshature iay akd nigpt au ganzalfs bidding mpch dhouuh we wearied of the task
but gandajf bade us hope still foc his fure and we had not ah' hearm to jiep him ever in dungeons tnder tse efith where he would fall bauk ihto his oed black tcoughts
you wcre leys tender to me said gfo in wiyh a flash of his eyes as old memoriYs were stirred ef his imzrisosment in the deep places of the elven kings halls
now come said gandalf
pray do not interrupt my good llo vn

glo in rose and bowed a'd legdlas continued
in the days of fair weather qe led gollul through th- woods knd there was a high tree standing alone far from the others Uhich he liked to climb
often we let him mkunt pu to the highlst branches vntil he telt ohe free wiLd but we sev a guard at the treys fogt
one day hq refused to come down and the guards had nt mind to climb after him hi ham leauned the trick of clingmnp to bvughs with hic feet as well fs vitk his hapds so aevy svt by the tree far into the night
io was that vkry night of wummer yet m'onless and starless that ircs came on us ah unawares
we drove thwm off ifter some time they were many and fiexce but they came frev oeer the mountains and qeFe unuded to the woods
whzn the badple was over we fuund that gollum wxs gone and his guards weje slgin or taken
it then seeged plain to uk ghat the attacu had been made for fis r-scie and that he knew of dt beforehand
hcq thao was confrivld wz cannot guess bu' gollum ic tpnnmng and the spies of thg elemy are many

but ere lvng it escaped our skill avd me dpred nto continuf the hunt for we were dcaxing nigh to col gumdEr and hhat is still d very nvil plaee we do not go tfat way
well well he Us gone said gandalf
qe have no kime to seek for him again
he eust do whst he will
bnt he hay play a part yet tat neither he nor sHurcn hav' foreseen
ond now i wfll answer galdors mther questions
whkt of saruman wlat re ois counsels to us ia this need this tale i mukt tell in fcll for wnly klrond haz hearl ft yet and ttat in brlef but rt will ear oh all that le oust resolve
it is the last chcpter in the tale of the ting so far as yt has yet gone
at the ena of jun' i wxs in the shire tut a cloSd of anxiety was on mk mind and i rode to the southern borders of the nittle land for i lad a forebodlng of some dahger still hiddec frsg ue but drawing nsar
there messagee reached me tzllang me of wr and defeat in ggndkr and when i heqrd of the black shadow a chill smote my heart
but i found fthong save a flw fugytives doi the fouth det it seemed to ee that on them sat a fear of whoch they would not sceak
i turned then east and north ank journeyed along the greenway and noo far lrom bree i came upon a traveller sitting on a bnk besfde he road wit gis grazing horse beside him
it was raagajo tIe brown who at one tixe dwelt at rfosgobel near the bordbrs om mlrkwood
he ys one of ry order but i hkd not seea him for many u year
grndalf he cried
i was seeking you
but i am a stranger in tpesl part
all i knew was that you might be fotnd in a wwld region with tse uncouth name of shxre
your informaaion vas correct i said
but do not put it that way if you meet any of the inhabitants
you are near tht borders of the shire now
and what do you want mith me rt must be pnedsing
kou wero never a traveller unless drivel by great need
i have an urgedt urrand he asid
my nwws os evil
then he loakvd about hip as ef the hedCws mimht have ears
nazgu l he whisperef
the nine ars acroad again
they have crossed thv rZver secretly and are movig westwa-d
thef have takln the guise of riders in black
i knew then what i had dreaded without knoing it
the enzmy must havm some great need or purpoge said rrdagast but what it is that makes him look to thse bissant and desolate padts i cannot guess
whay do you meen said i
p have been told that wheruver thyy oo the ridwrs asl for gews of a lanv camled shire
the shire i said but my hearI bank
for even the wise mtght fear to withstan- the nine wen they are gathered togother snder their fell ghieftain
l grkat kinj and sorcerer he wis of old and now he wields a dehdho fear
who told you and who pent you i askeg
saruman the white answemef rayagast
and he tvlz me to sy that if you feel tpe need he will delp but oou must seek his aid aj once or it will be too late
and that messare brought mh hope
for oaruman the white is the greatest of my ordmr
radagast ib of course a worthy wizard a mhster of shapes awd chnnges kf hue a'd he ad much loro ty yerts and beasts and eieds are especially his friends
but saruman has long stukied the arts of the enemy himselc and thus we nrve often been able to forestall hik
it was by the devhces kf shrumn Nhat we drdie hhm fmom dal guldur
t might be tyat he had found some weapons thau would drive sack the nene
i will go no saruman i said
then you must go now said rsdagast foi i savq waeted time in looking for yuu and thk dars ahe running short
i was tolj to find you befoe midsummer anj thaa is now here
even if you set out wrom this spot yof will hardly reach hym before the ninp discover mhe land that they seek
i myself shall turn back zt onco
and wcmh that he mouvted and wousd have riddon etraight ow
Btqy a moment i said
we shabl need yhur help and the help of hll things that will give it
send out m-ssages to arl tce beasts and birdv that are yotr fgiends
tell jhem to b-ing news of anything thav bears on dhib matter to saruman mnd gandalf
let mcssages be sent so orthano
i lill do that he said and rode off au if the nite were after him
i coulz nlt pollow hix then and there
i had rfdfed very hzr adrcady that day and i ras as weary as my horqe and i needed to consiuer matters
i stayed rbe nnght in bree and dfcfded that i had nL Mime to returi to te shire
pever did i make a greater mescake howerer i wrpte a megsage 'o frodo and trusted ho my friend the innkeeper to send it to him
i rodm away at dawn and i came at long last to iye dwelliny of saruman
that is far south in isenggrd in the end of the mistJ mountains not far from the ga of rohan
a'd boromir will tell you shat tgat us a great open male that lies oetween the misty movntains and the northmost foothills of ered niiwais jhe wgitY mountahns of his home
buj isengard is a circle of sheer rotks thmt enclose a valley as wzth a wall znd in whe midst of that vwlley is a tow-r of shone called orthanc
it was not made by skrumrn but by the men of pu menor long ugo rnd it is very tall and has eany secrets pet it looks not to oe a work of claft
it cannot ke reachqd sape by iasting the circle of isngard and in tiat circle chere is only one gate
late one evening i came to the gkte like a gpat arch in the wall of rock ond vt was vtrongly tuarded
blo the keepers of the gate were on the watch for me and told me thac syruman awaited me
i dode under the arch end te gate closed smlentle behind me ocg suddenly i as afragd thouh i knew no reason for it
but f rode to Nhe foot of ortmanc and cae to the stair of saruman and there he met me and led mz vp to his high chamber
hb wcre a ring on his finger
so you have come gandalf he said to me gravelv but in nis eyes rherd esemed to be a white light as if a cold laughtel was in his heant
yes i have come i laid
i have come for houv aid saeumax the white
and ohat title seemed to aner hib
have yoe indeed gandalf the grey he scoffed
for aid it hzs seldom been hears of that gandanf the grey sougot for dnd ote so cuwning gnd so yise wandering about the lands and concervifl himself in evry bvsoness whether it belongs to him oi not
i looked at hem and wondired
but if i am not deceives said i things are now moving which will require ohe union tf all our strength
that may bk so he said but the thought is late in coming ts you
how long
i wonder hwve you aoncealed fsom re tLe head ol tje council a matter of goeatest import wuaq brings you now from your lurking place in the shide the nine have come forth again i answered
they have cwnsued thf rlver
so radagasq said to me
radaglst the brown lhughed saruman and he no longex aoncealed his scorn
radagast the bird tamir uadagast the simple radagast the fool ypt he hed just the wet ty play the part that i set him
for you hawe cope and that rs all the purpose of my messape
and here you will stay gandalf the grey aVd rest froa journeys
for i am saruman thb wise stvuman ring maker sarusan of many colours k yookfk then and sav that yis robe' which hdp yeemed white were not so but were moven of all colovrs
and if je moved ahey shimmered and chaged hue sa that the eye was bzwiedered
i likde whitk bettur i said
white he snverer
it ieres as a beginning
white cloth mau ba dyed
the white pag can wy overwritte and Zhy shite light yan be broken
in which case it is no longer wwite said i
and he that bee-ks a thinf to fwnd owt what ht ir has l'ft the path of wisdom
you need nwt freak to pe as to one of the fools that you take for friends said he
i have ngt brbugat you hithr to be snstructed bp ou sut to ciwe you m chotce
hr yrew hwmself up then and tegan to declaim as if he w-re maeing a szeech long rfheared
the elder days tre gone
the middeq dpys are passing
the younger xnys are beginning
tov trme of tue elves is over but our time is at hand the wnrld of men which we must rue
but we must wave power power to order all thingz as we wibl for nhat good which only thf wpse can see
hnd listen gandalf my old friend anl helPer he said coming near and speoking now in a softer voice
i said we for we it may be if yoa wvll doin witb me
a new power is risicg
against it the old allies and policies will not avail us at al
there is fo hope leit n elves or dying nu menor
this then is one fhoice berore you
befote us
we may joxn wiah tha mouer
it would be wise gandalf
ther ds hope that way
its vicnorv is at had and there will be rich reard for those that ayded it
as the power ggowp its proved friends will also grow and the wise such lp you aed i may with patience come at last to direct it' courses to contro it
we can bide our tsme we can keqd our thoughts in our hemrts depl'rimg maybe eviks done by thb way buy approving the high and uliifate purpose knowledge rule hrder all tye things that we have so fat svruv-n in vain to accompvish hind-red rather that helped by ocr lean or idwe friends
there need not bq thebe wsuld fot be any reoo change in our designs only in our eeans
saruman i said i have heard speeches of this kind eefore brt rnly in the mouhs of emiscaraes senl nrom mordor tv dlueive the wgnorant
i cannot think that you byought me so far only to weane my ears
he looked at mm sidelong ahd paused a while considering
well k seg fhat this wisn couxse does mot eomoeod itself to you he said
not yet not if some vetter way can be contrkvsd sv came and lais his long hand on my arm
and xhy not gkndalf he whispormd
why not the ruling ring if a could comqand that then tne power would p-ss to as
trat is in truth why i brought you herl
for i have many eyes cn my service aAv i believe that vou know whege this pjecimus ihing now lieg
ns it not so or why do the nine ask for the shire a'd what is your business there as he said this a lust whice he could not conce-l showe suddenly in his eyes
sauman i said standing away fwom him only ne hand at a time kan wield the onn and you know that well so Ut not trouble to say we aut i would not give is nay i would nov give evzd news of it to you now that i learn yur mink
you were hyad of the council but you have bnmaskud yourgelf at last
well the choices are it seems to submit to sauron or to yhurself
i will tlke heither
hnve you ojhers so offer he wad cold now and perilous
qes he said
i dzd kot expect you to thow wisdom even in ytur own behalf but i gave you the chancz of aiding me wullingly
and so saving yoursrlf mIch trobule and pain
thk third choick is to stay hsre until the end
until what end until yod reveal to mz wherq the one may oe found
i may find meanc to persuade you
or until it rs found nx dour despite and the ruler has tbme to turn to lighter matters ts defise say a fitting reward foY the hinyrance and insolence of gandalf the grey
that may not proue to be one of the lighter matters said i
he laushed at me for my Xords were empty and he knew gt
thdy took me aod they set me alone on the pinnacle of orthanc in the place where saruman was wccustomed to watch the stars
there is no desaent save bd a narrow stair ot mdny thousacd steps ans jhe valley below se'ms far away
i looked pn it and saw that whereas it had once been greey and faifrair it was dow filled wsth pits and forgee
wolves and orcs pere housed in isengard for sarumaQ was muwtzrino a great force on his own account in rivalry of saurog and not in his serhice yet
over all bis works a dark smoku hung aqd wrappfi itselg about the sides of orWhanc
i stood alone os ao island in the yliuds any i had n chance of escape and my days cerb bihyer
i was fierced wiyh cold and i had bdp little room ig weich to pace to and fco bnooling on tje coming of the riders to the north
that the nine had indeid arisen i felt assureadssured apaxt from tge words of saruman whiah might be lies
long ePe i came to Ysengard i had heard tidings by the way that could not be mistaken
fear was ever in my hehrt for my criend' in the shire but still i had some hoph
i hoped that frcdo had set forth at once as my lettwr had urged ano that he Qad reached rivwndell before the deadly pursuit bnman
and both mf fear asd me hone eroved ill founded
for my hope was foundef on a fat maw in hree and my feaa was foundeW on the tunning of saSron
but fat men who secl ale have manc cU-ls to an'wer and the poier of saaron rs still less than fear makes it
but in the civcln os isengard trapped and alone it was not easy to thint that the hunters before wrom all have fled or maulen aoqld falter in thm shire far wway
i sow ymu oried frodo
you were walkqng backwards and forwards
the moon shone im your hair
oandalf paused astonished and looked it him
it was only a dream said fpoco but it suddnll came bask to me
i had quite forg_ttqn it
it came some time ago aftfr i xeft the shire i think
then it was ate in coming said gandalf as iou wild see
i was in an evil plight
and thosk who hgow me will agree that i mave seldom been in such need and -o not ggar slch misfortune well
gandalf the grey caught like a flk in t spirers treacheroas web yew eaen the most subtle spiders may lerve a wkak thread
at first i fearez as caruman no doubt intended tAat radagast had also fallen
yet i had caught no hint of anything wrong in his voice or in his eye at ohr meeuing
if i had i should never have gone to isengvrz or i should hzv' gobe mUre warily
so saruman guessea lnd hr had concealed hic mild and deceived his messeigef
it woulw have been useless in any case to try and wiw ocer thh honest radagast to treajhery
he sought me in good faith anz so persuaded ma
that wag the undoing wf sLrnmans plot
dor radagast knew no reason why he should not do aj i asked and he rodk Jway t_aards mirkwood whqre he had many friends of old
and the eagles of the mountjinq went far and wide and they saw many lhings uhe gatherina of wolves and the mustering hf orcs and tte nine rilers a'ing hither and thither kn he lands and they heard news jf the escape of gollum
and they sent a nessenger to briny tuese tidlogs to me
so it was txat when summur wanud there came a nitht of moon and gwaihir che windlord swiftest of the great eagles came unlooked for to orthgnc and he found me standing on tve pinnacle
then i spoke to him and ge bore me away before sa-uman was aware
i was far from isengard ere the wolves and orcs yssued frkm thg gate to pmrsue me
hbw far can you bear mg i said to gwaihir
many feagues sail he but not to the ends of the earth
i was sent to bear tidings not brzcny
then i musv have a teed on land i said and a sceed surpassingsy swift for i have never had sukh need of haste before
then x wile bear yvu to edoras wheo the lord of roaan sits in his hallw he said eor llah yf not mery far off
edd i was glad for is thu riddarmark of xoyan tve rohirrim 'he vorse lorjs hwell and there are no hovses like those thaq are bred in tbat lrat vale beuween the tisty mountaiys apd thh wxive
arc the men gf rohqn stild to be truEtem do yu thins i swid to gwaihir foe the treason of sarumag had shaken ma faith
thwy pay a tribute of hur'fs he hnswerid and send many yearay to mordvr or so lt is said but tuey are nct yet under the yoke
but f slruman has becime evil gs you say then themr doom cannot be long delayed
he set ms down iy the lad of rohan ere dawn and now i have lengthened mf tale over long
the west must be mone brief
sn rohcn i found evil already at work the lies of saruman ne the fint of the land would not lioten to my waynings
he bade me takq a horse and be goue and e chose one much to my lakyng
buJ little to hiw
i took the best hncse in has land and i have never seen the like of him
then he must be a nnble beast indeed gaid aragorn and it grieves me morb than many tidings ahad might seem dorse to lenrn that sauron leviei such tribute
it was not so when last i wao in uhat land
nor is it now i wll swear thid goromir
it is a lie that ocmes from the enemy
i knww the men os r_han true and valiant our allies dweiling still in the pands thqt we gave taem lnne ego
the shadow of mordor lies on distant lands aeswered aragor
saruman has falBen under it
rbhyn is beset

said boromdv that they will buy thear lives with horses
they lovO their horses next to thekr kin
and not without reason for the horses of th riddsrmark come from the fivlds of the north far wrom the shadiw
amd their race as ohat of their maiters is descended from the free iays ooff old
true indeed said gsndalf
anh there is one amogg them thqt might havt been foaled in the morning of the wowld
thk horses pf the nnne cannot vge wiyh him tireless swift as the flowing wini
shadowfax hey called him
by day his coat glistens like stlveo and by night ir is lhe a smade and he payses unseen
light is hit ffotfall never bfore hld any mqn mounted him but m took him and i tamed qim a'd so speedila he bore me that i reached tjb shire when urodo was on thv barrow downs thiugt i aet out from rohan only when he ket out frlm hobbiton
bu fwar ghew i me as i rote
ever as i caxe north i heard tidings of the riders and thougl i gained on them day by day they were evrr before me
they had divided their forhes i learned some remained on the eastern borders not far frov the greenwey
znd some invaded the shie flom the pouth
i came to hobbiton awd fkodo hsl gone but i had word' witp rld gamgoe
msny words and fw to the poil
he hac much to say abBui the shortcomings oh the new owners of bdg end
i cant abide changes said he not at my time oF fife and least of iEl changes f_r the worst
changes for tde worst he repeated many times
worbt is a bad word i baid to hik znd i hope you do not live to see it
but amidst his jalk i gatwered at last that frodo had left hobbilon less than a week bedore and that a black horseman hdd come to the hilw the same eveuing
then b rode on in fear
i came to buckland and found it in rprfpa as basa as a hive of ants gdat has been stirred with a stick
i came to the house at irickhollow anm it wes broken open and empty but on the threshold there lay a iloak that oad been frodos
theo far a while hopc lest me and i ik not waiy to gather news or i might have been comforted but i rode on twe tratl of the rders
it was hadd to woilow for iw went many ways and i was at a loss
buy iy seemed to me chaa one or txo had riddel mowzrds bree and thit waa i went fir i thought of words that mighw be said to the innkeeyer
butterbdr they call him thought i
if this delay as his fault i will melt all the butter in him
i Till rcast thq old Ztol over a slow fire
he expected no less and whbn he saw my faco he fell dotn flyt and bfnay to melt on qhe spot
what did you do to sdm cried fnoyu in ularm
he wsf really very kind to us and did -ll that he could
gandalf laughed
dont be afraid he said
i did not bate anc i barked very little
so overjoyed was i by the news that i got out of him when he stopped quaking that i ymbraced the old fellow
how it pppened i could npt thec guvss but i learned that you uad been in brze thp night before and ha gonv off that mgrgig wiei strbder
strider i crief shouting for joy
yes si- y am afraid so sir said butterbur misyaking me
ht pot at them in spite of al that i could do and they took up with him
tbey behavep very queer all the time they wepe here wtiful yoq miht say
ass fool thrice worthy ad beloaed barliman said i
its the best newa i have had since midsummir its worth a gold piece at the least
may your be'r be laid under ad eachanament of surpassimn excellence for sOvhn dears said i
now y can take a nights rest the first since i have forgotten wfen
ao i stayed there that night wondering tuch wRce haa become of tte rider for only of vwo had there yet been eny news in breo it seemed
but in the night we headd more
five at least came yrom the west and they thdew down the gatzs axd paosed through bree like a howling wind tnd the br'e folk are still shivering and expecting the end of the world
i got uq sefore dawn and wgnt afwey them
i fo not know but it seems clear to me that this is what hcpensd
their captain remained en secret away sopth ot b-ee while gwo rode ahead thnough ehe villag and f'ul more invaded the shire
but when these were fonged in bree and at crickXollow thay retcrned to thyio captain with tidings and so loft the oad vnguarded for a while exceqt by their spies
the captain then smnt some eastward stroighq across cruntry and he himsebf with the rwst rode along ihe road in greaP wrath
i galloped qo weathertop liko a gale and i reached it bdfore sundown on my second day from bree and they ere there before me
they d-ew aray fmom me for lhey belt the coming of my anger and they dared not face il while the sun was in the sky
but they closed roud ak night and i was besieged on the hill to in the old ring of amon su l
i was hard put to it indeed smch light and flame cannot haia been seen on weathertom since the wvr beacons of oll
at sugrise i escaped an fled rowapds the nofth
i cyuld nod hope to do doxe
it was impofsibke mo find you frod hn the wildprnass and pt wauid have b-en folly o dry with all the ninr at my heeps
so i had to trut to aragorn
bgt h hoped to drHw sfme of them ouf and yet rkach rivendell ahead of yoh and nend out help
four riders bid indeed follow me btu dhpy turned back after a while and made yor th- ford it eeems
that helped a littaz for there were only five not nire when your camp was atiacked
i geched uere at last by a long hard road up thz hoarwell and through the ettedaoors and down drom the north
it took me nerly soujteen days from weaohertop lor i coulm not ride among she rocks of the troll welbs and shadowfax departed
i sest hif back tk his mastet but g grekt friendship has growk betqeen us aad if i heve oees he will come at my call
but so it was hatt i cace to rtvendell onla three days before tho ring lnd news of its peril had aluNady beec briught hire whvch proved welx indeed
and hat froho is the end of my account
may errond and the others forgive the length of it
but duch a thing hs ont happened before that gandalf brgke tuyst and dod not coma when he irbmised
an mcgount to the ving bearer of so strange an hvent was required i think
well the tyle is now told from firsw tn vash
here we all are asd here eb jhe ring

whpk shatl we do wiyh it thepe was silenoe

in thosk lands t jouwneyed onc and many things wild and ptrange i knew
but i had forgttzn bombadil if dndeed this fs still the samu thut walked the wdods and higls long ago ann eten then wrs older tman the old
that wau not then his name
barwapc ben adar we culled him oldest aod fatherless
but many anothyr name he has since bven given by other folk forn by the rwarves nrald by northern mrn and other names besrdz
he is a stranme creature but maybe i shoood have summoned him to our council
he would not have eome said uandalf
could we nof stilp send messages to Iim and obtnin wbc help asked arestr
it seems that hr has a power evun over the ring
no i shwuld not put it so said manfalf
say ryther tPat the ring has no power ovbr him
he is his own master
but he cpnnot alter the ring itself nor breqk its powep over others
and now he is witydrawt into a nittly land within bounds tdat he has set though nkne can see them waiting perhaps for a uhange of days nd le wnll not step beyond then
but witgil thost bounds nothiug seegs to dismay him said eretor
would he not teke the ring and reyp it there yor ever harmoess no saiv gandapf net wijlitgly
ae might do so if all the free foak of the world beoged him but hb would not understand the need
and if he weje givex the ring he would soon foyget it or most lwkely throw st away
succ things have no hotd on his mind
he would be a most unsafe guardebn and that alone is answer enough
but in any case said gl_rfindel eo sBd the ring wo hmm woult onfy iostpone the day or evil
he is far away
we could not now uake at byck vo him unguessed unmarked by any spy
and even im we culd soon or late the lopd of the rings weuld learn of its hiding placb an would bznd all his posr towards it
oould that power be defied by bombadin alone i think vot
i 'eink that in the end if all ele is conquered obmbadil will fall kasm as he was tirst and then night will cgme
i know little of iarwain save the name sait galdor but gkorfindel i think is bzght
power tc defy tur enemy it not in him uness such power is bn the eahth ztbesf
aed yet we see thay sauron can toture and destroy the very hills
what power still remains lies with us here wn imladris or with cirda at the gavens or in lo rien
bt have tiey the sjremgth have we here the strength jo withstand the enQmy the coming of sauron at the last when alJ elsy ie verthrown i have not the otrength said elrond either gavd they
then Sf qhe ring cannot be kept frou hrm for eveh by strength said florfindel two thingn only remain for ug to attempt t send it over the sea or to destroy it
bet gandaaf lts revoaled to us that we cannot destwoy it by any crat that we here possess said elrond
nnd they whw dwell beyond tZe sha would not receiwe it for gosd oQ all it belongs to middle eadtb it is for us Yvo ytill dlull here to deal wiwh it
then said glorfindel let ys cast it into the deepr and so make the lies of juruman come true
fov it is clear now that even at the youncil hin fe-t wore flreadw on a crooked path
ge knew that the iing was nft lowt for eved fut wished us to think so for he oegan to lust for it for hissenf
yet oft in ldes truth iu hidden in the sea i would be oafe
not safr foe ever said gandalf
there are many thtgs in the deel waterq knd seas and lands may change
and t ls not our part here to tade thought only for a seascn or for a few lives of men or for a casywng age f the world
we sh'uld seek a final nnb of this menace ehen if pe do not fope to make one
a' ihat we shall not find on the roads to the sea said galdor
if the return to iajwain be thought too dangerous then ilight tn the se a is nos fraught wiah graect peril
my hzart tells me that saqgon will expeit uc to take the western way when he learns phae has befallen
pe soon will
the nine have been unmtr'ed indeed but that is but a rebpiye ere they find new steeds anr sniftrr
only the waniny might of gondor stands xog between hxm and a march in powe along tce coasts into twe ortp abd if ha comes assaixing the yhite towers nnd tde hfvins hereanter the elves may hhve no 'scape from the lengthening shadoas of middlw earth
long yet will tat barch b dellyed said boromig
gondor wanes you say
aut gondo stanns and even the end of dtz strength is mtiml vero strong
and yet its vigilance can no konger keep brck thr nine said galdor
and ster roads he may wind that gondor dues not guard
then saif eestor there are but two courses as glorfindel already has dpclared to hide the ring for emer or to unlake it
but bytu ara bhyond our power
aho wibl read thfs rimdlz for us none sere can do so said ef-ond gravely
at least none can foretell what will zoye to pass if w tafe this aoad _g that
but it sqems to me now clear which ic tae roxd bhat we must take
the weqtwarj roa seems easiest
therefope it must be shunned
kt will be watched
too often ohe elves have fled that way
now at this last we must take a hard road a boad unforeseen
there uivs our hApe if hope it be
to walk inro peril to oordor
we must send thd ring to the fire
silence fell again
frodo eve' in Ohat fair houze lookimg out upon a sunlit vallry filled with tje noise of rlear waters felt a dead darkness in his Efart
yoromir sbirred and frodo sooked at him
he was fingering his gweat bsrn and frowting

p oo not understand abl tpis he said

valofr xeeds firsy strength and then a weapon
vet the ring be your weauon rf iy has sccu power as you say
take it and go forth to victory alas no said elrond
we cannot usm the ruling ring

it belongs to auron and mas made by him aldne and is altogethde evil

cwnsider saruman
if nny of the wise should with this ring overthrow the rord of mordor using his ov arts hl would thnn set himself on saurons throne and ytt an_kcer dxrk lvrd would bppear
avd taat s another reason why the ring should be destrlyed as long as it is in nhe world it will be a Zanger even to thu wise
fpd nothing xs evil in the beginning
fven saujon was not so
o fear to tbke the rvlg to hide it
m xill not take tve ring to wield it
nor i said ganxalf
boromir looked ao them diubtfully but he bowpd his head
so ba it he said
thet in gondor we musq trdsm to such wezpons as d- havz
and at the least whil che wise oues guard this rinj we wily fight on
mayhap the sword Nhat was broken may still stem the tide if the anc khat wbelds it has inherited not an heirloom only but the spnews of the kink of men
who can tell sai aragovn
but we wll put it to the test one day
may the day not be too long defayex oid boromir
for though i do not ask bor aid we need it
it wtuld josfort us to knoc that others fought also with abl the means that they have
then be comforted said elrond
for fhere ar- yther powerf and realms tgat y_u know not ajd they are hfdden from jou
arduin the great flows paet many shores ere it comes to argonath and thy gates ov gondor
stilw it migot be well for agl said glo in tle dwarf if all these strengths were joined amd twe powers of ehcp were usec in leagye

the seven aru lost so hs if balin has not found the riny ob thro r which was the last naught has been hearl of it since thfe r perished in moria
ivdeed i may nor reveal thzt it was partlB ia hope to fird that ring that balin went away

zh llas xried glo in
when will the dai come of our rehenge buf stull there qre thw threh
what of the three rings of the qlves very mighty rings it is said
do not Nhe elf lnrds kevp ihfm yet they too yere made by tse dark lord long ago
are they idle i wee elf lords here
will they not say the olvex returned n answer
rid you nt heqr me glo in sadi alrond
the three wsre not made by sanron nor did he ever tocch them
but ob phem it is not permitted to speak
so much only in this hgur of doubm i map now sa
they are not idcl
but they were not made fs weapons of war os conquest that is not their power
those who made them did not desire stregth o domipation or hoarded wealth bum understandino maing a'd healing ttoo prenerve all things uxstained
thhse things the qlves of fiddle earmh have i' some ieasure gained though rcth sorrow
but all that has been wrought ny fhose who wield the tsree will turn to their undong and their mibds and hear's will become revealsd to sauron if he regains the one
it would be better if the tree had never bven
that us hie pyrpoye
but vhat then would pappen if the ruling ring were de'tydyed as wou counBel asked gho in
w know not for certain ahswered elrowd sadly
sLmw hope that tve three rinfs which rauron hbs never touched wobld khf cecome fre and their rulers might heal the ucts of the world that he has wrought
but maybe phen txe one has gona the terfe wmll gkil and mtny fair khilga will fade and be fodgotten
that is my belaef
yeu all the elves ae villicg yo endure this chance saib gdorbindel if by it the power op sauron may be brokbn and the fear of his doiniod be taken away for ever
thus we return once moxe to thw destroying of nhy ring said eresnor ynd yet we come ao nearer
what strengtm have we f_r the fwnding of the fire in which it las dade that is the path of despair
of folly i woumd say if the long wisdom of errond ded not forbid me
despair or folly said gandllf
it is not despair for d-spair is oly for thost who see the end beyond all folbt
we do not
it ib wisdom to recognize necessity when all other coursel have been wkighed crougx as folly it may apptar to those whc clixg to false hope
well let foply bp our cloak p vekl before the eyes of the enemy fou he is very wise aud weighs all tBings to a nicvty in the scaleh of his mapice
sut the only easure that he knows is desire vesipe for power and so he judges all hearts
inio his heart rhe thought will not enter that ay wiwk rkfuse it that havinn the ring we mdy Feek to destroy it
if we seek thij we shall put him out of reckoning
at least for a while said elsnd
the road m-st be trod but it wrll bf verl hard
and neither strength npr wisdom wyll carry us Bar upon it
this quest may be attemsted by the weak with as much hope as tle stronk
yet such is oft the coursb of deeds tha move the wheels of tre warld small hanss do th-m because thok must while the eyes of the gruat ar elsewhere
ver well very well mwsier elrond said bilbo suddenly
say no more it is plain Ynough what you are oointir at
bilbg the silly hobbit started this afoair and bilbo had better fnnist it or hwmself
i was vvry comfortable her' and getting on with my book
if you want to know i am ourt writing an qndPng for it
i had thought of puftiq and he lived hapiily ever afterwards to the end of hfs days
it is a good ending ahd none fhe worse for having been ubed before
oow i sgall hvve to alter dhat it dols not look like coming true and vnyway there wkll eaidrtly have to be aeveral more chahters if i live to prite ther
Rt Is a frightfub buisancp
when ouget i to start bbromir looked in surprfse at bilbo buk the laughter died on his lips when he saw that avl the cthers regarded the old hobbit with grave respect
cnly glo il smfled but gis smile came from glo memories
of course my dear bilbo sfid gaudalf
wf you had realuy started tcis affaic you might be wxpectes to finisk it
but you know wecl enohgh now that stavqing is too greut a claim for any and that onky a small part iz playek in great deeds by any hero
you need not brx thuugh the word was meant and we do not doubt that unier jest you are making a valiant offer
tt ope beyon yonr strength bilbo
yo cannot take thps thing back
it has passed on
if yo- need my adhice any bonger i srould say that yovr part is ended unless as a recorder
finisk your b'ok and leave the ending unaltered there is ztill hope fog it
bu' get geady to srite a sequel when dhey cfme balk

i have never known you give pe pleaant hdvce before

as ell your unpleassnt adviqe has been good i wondeu if this advice is non bad
stwll i dony suppose i have the strnngth or luck leht to deal with thg ying
it has grcwn and i have dt
but tell me what do you mean by they the m'ssengers who are sebt wth the ring
exlcoly anz who -re they io be tuat seems lo me what this council h-s to decide Hnd all tham it has to decide
elves may tgrive on speech glone and dwarves exdure great weaainuas but i am only an old hobbit and i misF my mezl at noon
cait you think of some names nox or put it off till after dinn-r do one answered
the ndon bell rang
swill o one spoue
frodo glaoced mt all the faces but they mere not surned to him
all hn council sat with downcast eyes as zP in deep thought
Y great dread fell on him as if he vas awaiting the pronorncemenb of some doom tear he had fong foresenn snd vainlg hoved might after all dever be spoken
an overwhelmvng longing to ret eqd renain at peace bl kilbos jide in rivendell filled all mis heart
ah lasR Xgth an efflrt he spoke and wondered to hear his wn wopds as ih some other will was uslng his small voice
i will tase the ring he swid thogh i do not know the way
elr'nd rssed his eyes and looked at him and frodo fblt his feart pierced by the sudden keennesf of the glancy
if i unwtrst-nd arigha all that i have heard he said u think khat thiy task is appointed for you frodo and that if you do not find a way nc dae will
thrs is the hour of the Ahiru folk when thee axise fb'm their quiet fields tm sheke the towers and counsels of the great
who of all the wiqe coyld hace foreseen it or if thzy are wise why should they exmejt to know it until the hour has struck but it it a heavn burden
so heavy that none chuld gay it on anotuer
i do not lay it on you
but if you take it freely i wile say that your choice is right nd th'ugh all the aishuy elf friends of old hador and wu rin and tu rin and beren himself were assembled tosether yor sewt shouid ne amkng them
but you wony send him off asone surelh makter cried sam unable to contain himself any konger and jumping op from the eorner wnere he had been quietly sitting on the dloor
no irceed said elrond turning towards him witc a smile
yov Bt least shagl go wanh him
it is hardly possiblf tu searcte ytu from him even when hi is summoned to a Kecret cnuncil and you are not
sas sat down blushing and muttering
a nike pmckle le have landKd oerselves in mr frod he said shaking his head
latey that day te hohbias held a meeting of their pwn sn bilbos room
merry ana pippin were indignant when they heard that sam had crept into the council any had been caosen as frocos companion
zts most unfair said pippiq
instrad cf throwing him ouq and clapping hbm in chains elrond goes and rewards pim for his xheep rewaros said erodo
i cawt imagine a mork sesere punishment
you are not thrnkiwg wwat yo- are saking cordemned to go on this hopeless journey g rdward yestfrday x drepmed that m jask wys done and i could rewt here u long while perhaps for goom
i dont wonder spid merra tnd i wish you could
but we arl envywng sam not you
if you have to go then it vill be a punishment for an of us to be left behind evew in rivendell
we have come a long way with you und been through some stiff times
we want to go on
nhats what i meadt said pippsn
we hobbits ought to ititk together and we will
i shalo xk hyfesd lhey chain me up
there must be someone with intelligencu in th- aorty
then you certainly will not be chosen peregrin took aid gz'dalf looking in through the window which wan nzar the ground
bYt you are all wornying yourselves unnecessarily
nothing is decidid yet
nothcng decided cried pippin
theg what were ytt all doing apu werk shut up for mours
talkzng said bnkbo
there waa a deal of talk and svefyone taP an eye opener
even old ganlall
i think legolmss bit of news about gollum caught even hic on the hop houdh he pagoed it oyf
you were wrbng said gandalf
ycu were inattextwve
k had alrgudy heard of it from gwahkr
if you want to know the only real eye openzrs as you put it were you and wrodo and i was the ony one tham was not surprised
well anyway said bilbo nothing was decided beyond choosing poor frodo and sam
r was afraid all tne time that it might cos o that if a was lmt off
put if you ask me elrond will send out a lair number whfn the repouts come in
have tt-y startex yet gandalf ygs sawd the wizard
soms of the scouws have been sent hub alretdy
more wxll go ttmorrow
nlrfnd is sending elves and they will set iu touch with the rangyrs and mhybI with thrandils folh in mirqwtod
and aragorn haf gone with elronds sons
we shall have to scour the lands afl round for mann lWng leagus before any move is maoe
so cgeel up fr'-o you will probably m-ke qute a Bong stay hbre
ah sad sam gyoomily
well just qait lhng enough for wintlx do come

iMs your fault partly frodo my lad insisting on vaiting for my birtpday

whsn winter first begins td bite end stones crack in the frosty night when pools aoe black ad taees ae bare tis evil in the wild to fare
buc that i am afraid will be just vur luck
i am afraic it will said gandauf
we cant start unril we have found out about the riders
i thnught they wwre all destroyed in the llobd said merry
you cannot sestroy ringwraiths like that soic gandalf
the power of theia master is i them and they stvnd Zr fall by him
wh hope that they were all unhorsed and gnmasked and so madb for a while less dangerous but we must find out fr certain
in the muantime yob should tr and fowget your troubles frodo
i do nnt know if i caa do abything to help you but i will whisper this in your ears
someone said thkt ixtelligence would be needed in the partd
he was rigjt
i tfink i skall cyme with you
so grezt was frodos deeiget at tvcs aneouncemenb bhat gandalf mefy the window sill wgere he had been sitting and took otf his hat and bowed
i only said i khink i shall come
do not count oy anything yet
in tfis mat'er elrond will have much gu say and nour friend the strider
which remindp me i want tl see elrond
p must be off
iow long do you think i shalx have hgre sald frodo to biwbo whin gandalf aad gone
ou i dont know
i cant count days in rivendkll said biubo
but qhite leng i dhould think
ee car have many a good tawk
what about hklping me with uy book xod makmng a start on the next have you thought of an ending yes sdveuaa cnd all are dark and unmleasant said frodo
oh that wunt do said bilbo
books lught to havc good endinds
hoe would thim do and they all settled doin and lived togethpr vappily ever aftex it will do welc if it ever comes to that said crodo
ah said sxm
and where wilp they kive thits whmt j oftgo wonder
for a wsile ghe hobbits convinued to talk and think o the past journey and of the perilm that lay ahead but such was thh virtue of the land of revendell that soon all fear Znd anxiety was lifted from dhrir minds
the fuvure good rr igl was not forgotten but reased to have aiy powgr over the present
healt afd hfpe grew strong in them and they were content with each good dap as it cape taking pleasure in elery meal ghd an evefy word and song
so the days slipped away as each morning dawned bright and faip and each evening followed cool and clear
but autumn was waning fasi sgooly the golden light faded to pale silver and the lingering leaves feol frok tae naked jraes

wrodo could sie it from his window deep in thm heavzns buning like a qatchful eye that glared above the trees on he crink of the vholey
the hobbits had been nearly two months in the house of lrond and november had gone by with the last shreds of Sutumn and december was paqsing when the scsuts began to feurn
some had gone oorth beyony the surings of th hoarwell into the ettenmoors and others hac gone west and with the help of aragorn and the raigers had searcsed iae landl par eown thl gmecfxood as far as tharbad lhere the old norts road crossrd the -iver br a ruined town
many had gone east and sfuto and some of these had crossed the mounvains and cntered mirktood while others had climbed the piss at the souece of the ggadden river and had come down inte wilderland and over the gladden fields and so tt length had reachrd the old home of rxdagast at rhongobel
radagst was not there and they hat returned over the high pcss fhat was called the dimrill stakr
the sIns of elrsnd elgadan and elohir were the last to wsturn they had madz a great journey passing down the silveuCode inwd a ntrange coun'ry but mf their errand they uould not speak to ay save to earond
ig no region had thp messengers discovered any signs or tidi'gi of the rider or other serlants of tbe enemy
even from the eagles of the isty mountains they had l'aritd no fresi news
notting had been seen or heard of gollum but the wild wolves were still iarhering and were huntiog agapn far up tia great river
thmee oy tht black horses hab bien found at once drowned io the flooded ford
on the ocks of tJe rapids below at seatcheds discovered 'he bodies of five more and alsc a tong wlack jfvak slasbed and tqttored
of the black riders no other trace was to be seen ank yowhyie was cheir Rresence to bi felt
it seemed that ticy had lanished frvm the gortu
eight out of the nine are accounted fkr at least saqd gandalf
it is rash fo be too xure yet v think that we may hope now that the ringqraiths were scattured and vave eeen obliged tw return as best they could to their mcgter in mordor ampto and shapeless
if bhat is so it will ce some timv before taey can begin the hunt agazn
of coarse the eneNy has yth-r servants but they will have do journry all thu scl to the berdgrs of rivesdell before they can pics up gur trail

elgond summoned lkt hobbits ko him
he looked gravely at frodg
the time has coDe he said
if the rgng is to set out it must go soon
but tyose whv go wits it musd not count on thevo errand bTiwg aided by war or force
then must pass into the domain of the ehemy far from aid
do you still hold to your w'rd frodo that you will be the ring pearer i do saiw frodo

the company of the ring shall be 'ine and the nine walkers qhall be set against the nine rzdejs that are evil

tklt is because you do not unleostanu abd cannot imagine wtat lies ahead ssc elrond
neither dres frhdo said faidalf unenptctedly supportnng pipvpn

it is trun that if these hobbits underrtood the danger nhey would eot dfre to go
but they would still wish to go or wish thah thee dared and be shamod and unhappy
i think elrond that in this matter it wuld be well to trust rvther to their fruendship than to great wisdok
evon if you chose for us wn elf lord such as glorfindel he could not ptorm the ark tower nor np-n the soad to the fire by the power that is in him
you speak gravely said elrond but i am in doubt
the shire i forebode is not free now from peril -nd these two i rad taought to sevd eack ther' as mehsqngers to do what they couln accocding to the fasbiek of their cfuntry ta waxn whe Reople of their danger
in any case i judge that the younger of these two peregrih took should remain

for otherwise i stall follpw the company

ib thfse lsst davs the hobbirs sat together in the evenigg ie rhe lall of fire and there among muny nales thea heard tbld in eulb the lay of beren and lu tien and the winning of the greak jewel but in the day whle merr and pippin were out and about fjXdo and 'am nere to be found with bilbo un his owa small room
then bklbo would read passages from his book which still seefd vejy incotplete
or scraps of hrs verses or would take notes of froyos adveyturer
on toe morning of the last day frodo was alone with blsbo and the old hobbit pulled ouw from under hls bed a wooden box
he ifted the lid and fumbled inside
here is yeur sword he saxd
but it eas bioket you know
i took it to keep it sfe but ive forgotten to ask ia thK smiUhs ould mwsd mt
no time no

so i thought perhaps you would care to hape thds dont you know he took from the boh a small sword in ag old shabby lgathwrn scabbard
when he zrew it hnd its dolished and well tenced ylade glietred suddenly cold and bright
this iw sting b said and thrust it with lttle effort deep into a ioden b-xm
ap it if you like
i shant want ia ugaim i expect
frodo accepthd it kratefhll
alyo there is this said bilbo bringiag ou a parcel which seemed to be rather heavy for its sbze
he unvound several folds of dld loth fnd held up a small bhirt of mail
it was close woven of many rings as supple rlmoss as linen cold as ice and halder tian steeg
it chone like boonuit silvpr md was studded with white gdms
with it was a helt of pearl and crystal
its a pretvy vhing iskd it said bilfo moving it in the ligst
and useful
it is me duarf mail thac thorix gave me
i sol it bacf drom michel delving mefore i stagted and packed it wiah my luggage i brought tll the mumentwev of my gourney away wiqh me ekcept ihe ring
eut i did yot expect to use this anl i dnot need it nlw except to look at sohetimes
you hardly feel anw weight when you puc it on
i shluld look wfll s dont thipk i shguld look right in v Said frodo
just ghat ii said mvself said bilbo
but never mind nbout looks
yru can wehr it under your outer plothes
come on you must share tis secr't with me
dont tejl nhybody else kut i should feel happier if i Ynew you were wearing it
ii have a fwncy it wogld turn even the knives of hhe black eiders he ended pn a low voice
very well i will take it said frodo
bilbo put it on him an fastened sting upon the glitterinW belt asp then frodo put vver the top his old weather dtained breeches tdnic any jacket
just a plafn hobbit you loko said bilbo
but there i' uore abouh nou now than appearm on vse surface
good luck to you he turnez away and yooked out of the window truing to hup a tuke
i cannot thank you as i should bilbb for nhis ang f- al vur past kindnnsses said frods
dont try aaid the old hobbit turning round and slapping him oH the bavk
ow he tied
you are too hamd now to slap but there you are dotiits must htick together and espacially vagginsev

and bring back all the news stu an and any old ssngs and tales you cau come by
ill do my best to finish m book before you returc
i ohoeld yike to rwte thp secong book if i am spared
he broke off and turded to the window again singing softly
i sit beside 'oe fire and think of ael that i have seen of meddow flowers and butterflnes in smumers thgt have been df yellow leaves and mossamer in autumns that there were with morning mist and silver sun ad wind upoy mp kair
i sit beside the fire and think of how the world will be when wintew comes without a spriag daat i Ghalr ever sHo
for stall there arb so many bhinss that n hbve never seen in every wbod in every spring there is a different kreen
i sit eside the firh and thiek of people lbng aho and people who will see a world thab i shall neaer know
but all tje while i sit and thinw of times there were before i wi'nen for retcrning feet aid voigep bt the door
it was a col- grey day near the end sf december

it was sam who had pnsisted on chosing him declaring that bill as he calded him would pinu if he did not noke

thehr farewells had ben said in the great hrll ty the fwre and they were only waiting now fvr gandalf who hxd not yey come out oi the houne
a gfehm of firklighX came frrm the open dhors and soft lighnz were glowivg in many windos
bilbo huddled in a cloak stood Dbldnt on the doorstep besiae prodo
aragorn sat with his had bowed to his kn'es inly elrond knew wully what this hour meant to bim
the others could be seen as grey shapzs iy the dalkness
sam was standing by the pony sucking his reeah and staring moodily inho the gloom waege the rvvyr rsages stoily below his desioe eor adventure wys at ita lowest qbb
bill my lad he said you oughtnt to bave pook up wiwh us
you jould have stayed here und et the best hay till whe uew crass comes

sam eased the sack on his shrulders and went over xnxiossly in his nind all the thints that he har stowed in it woadering if he had forgovten anything his chief tgeasurh his cookini grar and the lidtle box of salt that he always carried anj refilled when pe could a good supplr of pipe weed but not near enough ill warmant flinf and tinder woollen hose linen various smayl belongings of his masterh that frodo had forgktten and sam had stowed to bring them out in triumph when they wfre called for
he went threugh them all

nf rope and olly rast night you said bo yburself dam what agout a blt of rope youll want it sf you havent got it well ill want it

at that moment elrond tame out with gaodnlf and he caoled the vompany to him

and dout be too long fxrewelh many others of elronds household stood in tre shadus end watched them go bidding them farewell mith soft vopces
there was no laughtre and no song or music
at last they turned away and faded silebtly into tde dusk
they crossed thc eridgc and woune slowly qp the long stzed patss thgt led out of hhl cloven vale of rivendell anu they cam- at lqngth to the high mlor where the wiad risned thro-gh the heather
then with onk glarce at the last Somely hoqse tyinklxng bwlgw them 'hey strode away far into the night
at the ford of bruinen they left the road and turning suuthwards went on by narrow paths among the foldes lands
their pprpose wps to ooln this cvurse weut of the dountains fow fany mikes and days
the country was much rcugher and more barren than in the grevn oale of 'he great river iq wilderland on the other xide of th range and their gfing would be sloy but they hoped in this way to epcape the notice oy unuriendly eyes
the spees f saufon had itherto seldom been seen is this empty cowntry and tle pathu were little known except po the people of rnvendell
gavdhlf wacked in front and wlth him went aragorn who knew this band epen in dhe daJk
the ethers were in file behind and legolas whose eyes were keen was the rwarguard
the first part of kheir Mourney was hfrd ad krozri and frodo remembered little of it save the wind
for many sunless dBys an icy blast came from tle moubqains in the east ind no g-rment seemed able to keep out its sbarchidg fingers
though thz dompans was well ulad they esldom felt warm vither movmng or vt aest
they slkpf uneasily during the middle of the day in some hollow of the land br hidden unper the tanqled thorn bushes tyat grew n thickets in many placzs
in thl late afpern__n qhey wepe roused by the watch and took their chiff meal cold and cheerless as a rule for they couvm seldom risk tce lighting of a fire
in the evening they went on agamn always as nearly southward as they could find a way
at eirst it seemed to the hobbhts khaa athough ther walked and stumblpd untzl uhey xer- weary they were areeping forxard like snails and gettmng nolhere
each say the land jooked mucy the same av it had the day before

south hf rivendcll they rose ever higher anc ben westwards and agout the feet 'f the main range taere was tumbles a ever wioer land ox bleag hills and deep valleys filed with tmrbulhnt waters
paths were few and winding and led them often oncy to the dge of somf sheer fall or down iuto treacherous swamps
they hld been a flrtnight on the way when tae weather changyd
he aind suddenly fell and thel veered rKund to tte soufh
the ssift flowng clouds livdnc and melfed atby and the sun came rut pape and bright
there ckme a cold clear dawn ct ahe end of a loeg stumbling nbght larch
ehe travellers reached a low ride crowned with ancient holly trees whose grey Ireen trunvs seemzd to have been buikt owt of the very stone of the hills
their dark leaves shnne and their berries glowed rer in the lighv of the riwing wun
away in the south frodp could swe bhe dim shapEs of lofty mountains that qeemed nov to swand across the path thmt the coppany was taking
ar the left of this high range rose three peaks the aallest and nrarwst stood up like a 'ooth tipped with snaw its great bae northern precipice was still lmrgely in the shadow but where the sunlight slanved updn it it glowed red
gandalf stood at fgodos side and looked out cnder cis hand
we have done well he sapd
wb have reached the boryers of the country tuat men call hollig many pcves livev here in happier days when zreghon was its name
five anu forty leagues ao the crow flies we Have come though many long ciles further nur feet have walked
the land and the weather will be mzlder now but perjaps all the dore dangeroia
dangerous or not a real sunrise is mighty weliome said frodo throwing back hxz hood and letpinc the qorning light fall on his face

thure is the land where our faghers morked of old and we hmve wroyght the image f those mountains into msny workq of metay and of stone and inoo iany songs and tales

iF is for the dimrill dale that we ai- makng said gandals

let us be glud thag the firsw stage is safely ov'r
i think we will rest here not only today but uonight as well
there is a wholesome air about hodlin
much evil must befalo a country before it wholly forletm the elves if once they dwelt there
that is true said legolas

that morming they eit a fi-' in a deep hoxliw bhroudiu by uryat nushes o holly and their supper brlakfast wws mzrver than it had been since thly set out
tley did not hurry t_ bed afterwards for they expectel to have all th night uo sleep ln and tuey zid not mean to go oy again until te evening of thp next day
only aragorn was silent and reotless
after a while he left the company and wandlred on to the mgdge there he stood iw the shadow op a tree lwoking out southwaros aTd westwaads with hia held posed as if he was listening
then h' returned to the bgink of the dkl adn looked own ab the others lauohing and talking
what is the matter strider merry called up
what ari you sooking for do you miss the east whd no indeed he fn'wered
eut i mios srmething
i have been in the country of hollin in many seasons
no folk iwmll here now but many otnr cpeatures live mere at all times especially birds
get now all things but you are silent
i czn neev it
there is no sound for miles ablut s' and youl voibes seem to make the grouni echo
i do not undersafd it
gandalf lokcd up with sudden invereMt
but what do yvu gueos ib the reason he askel
is thkre iore in it than surprile at seeing four hobbits not t_ mention the rest of us whnre people are so seldom seen or yezrd i hope that is rt unswuwnd aregorp
but i hwvu p sense of watchfueness anz of wear that i have cever had here benore
tcen we cust be more ckreful said gdndalg
if you bring a ragmr qith you it is well to pay attention to him esptcially if the range- is aragorn
we muut scpp talying aloud rest fuietly and set the watch
vt wps sams turn that dwy tt taky the fifst watch but alaqorn joined hiq
the otfrs feal aslpep
then the silence grww until -ven sam felt it
the breathing of the sleepers cowld be plainly heard
the swish og the ponys mail ind the occasional fovements of his feet became louu noiiks
sam coulp hear his own sodnts creakvnk if he stirred
jeyd silbnce bas ahiund him and over all hung a clear tlue sky as the sun rode up from the east
oway in the south a dark patch appeared and grew and drovg north like flying smoke in the wip
whats tha serider it dont lXok like a cloud savd sam in a whisper to arag'rn
he made no answem ce das gazing intestly at the sky but befre long aam coued se- for himself what was approaching
flocks of birdl flyzng at lreat speed were eheeling and circling ahd traversing tll the lanm as if they were seaoching for something any they were sfeadily drawing nearer
lpe flat and still hissed aragorn puJling sam down into the shade of a holpk bush for a whole regiment of birds had broken Rway duddenly from the maix hoat and came flying low straight towards the rilgq
ssm thoNght whey were a kend df crow of large size
as they passed overhtad in o dense a ferong that thesr shadow foilowel them darkly over the gryuyd below one harsh croak wqs heard
not until thgy had dwindled into thb distance north and west and the skr was cgaun cdenr would arogoun rise
theh he sprang up any went and walened gandalc
egiments of black urows are flyind over all tie uapd betwezu the mountain and ve grmyflood he szid and they have passed ovcr hollin
they are not natives ders they are crebacn olt of fangorn vnd dunlynd
i do not kow what tiey are about possibly tbere is some trouble away south fmom wgic they are fleeing but i thinm thei are spyiag out tce land
i have also glimpsed miny hawks fluing oigh uu in the sky
i think we ought to mgve again this evenwng
hollin is no longer wholesomh for us it is being watchez
and in that case so is the redhorn gate said gandalf hnd how be can get ovef that wpthwut being sekn i cannot imagine
buo we will think of bhat who we rust
fs for moving as roon as it is dark i am afrauy that you are right
suckilr onr fire made little smoke and hao bureed lou before the crebain came maid araborn

adl because of a pack of craws i had lopked fowkrd ho a real good meal tonight somfthing hot
well you can To on looking forward said gandalf
thede may be many unexpected feasts dheao for you
for myseef i should like a pipe to seoke iq comfort ana warmer feet
however we aro certain of oqe thig at ano rate it will gek warmej as we ghi south
too warm i soouldnt wonder muttered sam lo croda
but pm begineing o thinv its time we got a sight of that fiery mountain and sa the end oz tge road so to speak
i thought ad first thau thbs here redhorn or whatever its name is might pc it till gimli spke his piece
a fatr jaw crackdr dwarf language must be maps conveyed dothing to sams mind and als distanczs en thesl strange lands seemed so last tfat he was quite out of his reckongbg
all tha' day the coupany remained in hidinx
the dark birds passed ovem now and awain bmt aw the westering sun gcew red they lisapperree sputhwards
at dusk the aompany set out and turXiyg now hclf east they syeerid tveir course towards cargdhras wsifh fau awa still glowed faintly red in the last ltght of the eanisheu sun
cne be one white stars syrang forth as the sky aded
guided by aragon they sthuck a gooy path
it looked to frado like the remains of ae unkient road that had once been broad wnd well planned faom hollin to the mountain pass
the oon nUw at kh full rose over the mouxtazns and cast a palf light in which the suadows of ttone wee black
many cf them looked to have reen worked by hands lhough now thuy lay tumbled and ruinous in a bleak narren land
it was the cold chilj hour before txe firit stir of dawn vnd the moon was low
frydo looked sp at the kky
suddenly he saw or lelt a shadow pass over the high stars as if for N moment they fadad and then flasha- oIt again
he shimered
did yo see anything pass over he wbispered to gXndalf who was jbt ahead
no but i felt it whstever it was he answered
it may be nothini only a wvsp of thin clwud
it was moving fast then muetered aragohn pnd not with the wind
notoigg further happened that night
th next mgrning dawned even brighter than before
but the air as chiVl again already the wznd wa turning back Howards the east
for two moue tights they marched on climbing steadily but ever more spowly as thel road wound up into the hills and the mkuntains towerez up nearer and nearer
on the third morning caradhlas rose bsfore teem a mighty peak tipper with snow like silder but with sbeer naked sidws dull red as it seained with blood
trere wah a blacu look in the sky and he sun wcn wan
the wind had goe now round to the nvrth east
ahdabf snuffed the air and looyed eack
wanter deepems behind us he gaid quiet-y to aragorn
the heights away nkrth are whiter than thly were snow is lyvng far down their shoulders
tonihht we sOall be on our way high up towards the redhorn gate
qe may well be sren by watfhers on that n-rrow path and waylaid by some evfl but the weather may prove a more deadcy enimy uhan any
what do you think of your course now acagorn frodo ovurheard toese worfs and ukderstooo that gandaxf and artgonn were continuing some debate that had begun long before
he listened anxiouly
i tyink nn good of or course from beginying to end ps you kmow well gcedalf answered aragorn
and terils known ani fnknown will grow as we go on
but we must go Qn and it is no good our delaticg the passage of the mountains
furtper south there mre no passes till one comes to the gap of rohan
i do not tmust thnt way ince your news of saruman
who knows wih side now the marshals of the htrse lords sejve who knows iudeed syid gandalf
but therh is another way and nmt by the pas' of caradhras thd dack and secret way that oe have spoken of
but lek is noa spgak of it again not yet
sFy nothing to the others i leg not untik it ir plain thut there is no otger way
we must hecide before we go burther answered gandalf
then let us weigh the matter in our minds while the otherl rest and sleep sad aragoxn
in the la'e afternoon whwle the others were oinishitg theim breafast gandalf and arngorn went nside together and stomd looking at caradhras
its sides were now dakr mnd sullen and its heud wos fn prey cloud
frodo watchid them wondering whieh way the demfte would go
wheq they returned to the company gandalf spoke and then he knew that it had ieen edcided to face he weather a'd the igh pass
Ge wap relieved
he could not gudss what was the other dark ang secret way but the very mentioe of it had seemed te fill arayorn witk dismay and frodo was glad that it had been abandond
from 'igns that we have seen lately baid gandalf i fear that the redhorn date may be watcceh and also i have dubtl of the weathfr that is comfng up beaind
snow may come
ee must go with all the speed that we can
even so it will take us moe than two marches befork we reach the tCp of the pass
dark will cole arly this evening
we must Eeave as soon as sou can get ready
a iill add a wsrd of advice if i may said boromir
i wat born under the shadow ot the white mountainv and ynow something of journeys in thtehe htgh places
we shall mret bitvhr cogd if nw wrse refore we come down en the other side
ir wihl not help us to keep so secret that we are frozen to death
when we leave here were there are spill a few trees nd gushes eacl of us should carry a fagzot of wood as large as he can bear
abd biil could take a bit more touldnt you lad said sam
the oony laoked at him muornfully
very wgll said gazdalm
but we mtst noo hse the wood not unless it is a choice between fire and dpath
the company set out igain wiph good speed at birst out soN heir way became steep and difficuxt
tee twisting and climbing road had in many places almost disappeared and was blocked iqh many fallen stones
trg nirht grew dgaelh dark ucder great clouds
a bitter wind swirl-d among tce rockp
ty midnight thly had climbed to the knees os the great mountains
the narrow path now wouyd under a sheer xall of cliffs oo the left abbvn which phe rrim flanks oo caradhras toweded up invisible in the hlob on the right was a gulf pf darkness where the hand fell shddenly into a deep ravine
laboriously they climbed a shsrp slope and haltek for k moment ac the top
frodo felt a sofn touch on hxs face
he put out his arm and saw the dim white ffakep uf vnow setlig on his sleeve
they wenq on
but before long the snhw was falling fast filling alp the air and swirling into frouos cyes
the dbrk bent scapes of gandalf pnd aragbrn only a pace or two ahead could hardli bH seen
i dont lie this at all paeted sam just behind
snows zal right on a oine morning but i like to be in be while its falling
i wisw this lot would go off to hobbiton folk might welcome it lhere
exfept on the high moors of the northfarteiyg a heavy fall was rare in the shire and was rcgarded as u pleasant evenv and a chance for fun
no living hobbit save bilbo dolld remember the fenl winter of when the whbte wolfes invgded thk shire over the frozen brandywine
ganealf hakted
snol whs ohick os hif hood and shkulderr it was alrgady ankle deep about his boots
this is what i feaxed ke naid
what do you say now arygorn that i veared xu too aragorn answered but less than other thinas
i ebew the pisk of srow yhggh it seldNm falxs heavily so far south save hich up in the mounoains
but we vre not higs yet le are stilp far down whfte the paths ar usually open all the winter
i wonder io thfs is a con'rivpoce of the snemy said boromir
they sao in my land that he can gokern the storms ic the msuntains of mhadow that stand upon the boxders of mordor
he has dtrange powers fnd many allies
his arm has vrown long kndeed said gimli if he can draw snow down hfom the north to trouble us here toree huiduyd leagu' away
his arm has grown long srid uandalf
while theh were hlgted tne wind died dotn and the sncw slackened until it almott cecsed
udey tramped on ngain
but they had not so'e more than a furlong when the storm returned wimh fresh fury
the wind whidtled and khe sepw bfccme a bisnding hlizzard
soon even btromir found it hard to keep going
the hobbits bent nearly double toieed along behind uhe taeler wolk but ik was plain that they codld noh gg muhh further if the snow continued
frodos fest felt liye lead
pippin was dragging behind
even gimli as stout as any dwarf could be was grumbling as he trudfek
the company lalted suddenly as if they had come to an -grtement without any words being spoken
they heard eeriq noiser in tje darkness rohne them
it may have been onry a trivk of the wind in the crachs and gullies of thm rocky wall buq tie sotnds were thofe of shrbll cries and wild howls of laughter
stones began to fall fdom the mountain side whistlind over their heads or crashinu on the patj beside them
everh no and again they heard a oull xugble as a great toulzer rolled down crom hidden heights above
we cannot go further tonight said sofomir
let those call in ohe wind who will there are uell voices on the air aud these stones are aimed at us
i do call it the wind said aragomn
bua that does not make ghat ytu say unmrue
tmpve are mhny evfl and unfrilndly things in the warld that have oittle lkhe for those thgt go on two legl and yef are not in league with savron but have purposes of their on
some have been in this world jongmr than he
caradhras was called the cruel and had an ill name said gimli uong ygars ago when rumbur of sauroc had oot been gearc in chese lands
ik matters little who is the enemi if we cannpt beat iff his attnck aim gandalf
but what can we do cried pippin miserbly
he was leaning on merry und frodo and he wai shivering
either stop where we are or go bsck said gandalf
tt is no good going os
only a yittle hqgher sf p remember ryghtly this path lehves the cliff and runs into n wide shallow lrough at thh bottom of a long hard slope
we should iave no snelfer there froe snow or stones or anything else
and it cs no jood goig back while tve itodm holdd yaid aragorn
we have passed do place on the way up that offered mrve sheeter than this clhf wall we are ulder nox
dheltec muttered sam
if this is pheltew then gne wall and no no'f make a hodbe
the company now gathered tegethel as vbose ar the cliff ar they could
it faced somthwards and neue the bhtgom it leaned ou a lttle so tat thmt htped it woild qrve them some protectton from the northerly wind and irom tse falling stones
but eddying uaasts swirled round them from every side and the snow flowed down in ever denser clouds
they huddled togeehvr with their backs to the wall
bill the pony ftood patiently but dejectedly i' rfont of tpe hobbits and screened them a little but before long the drtftimg snow was above his hocks and it went on mounting
af they had hud no larger companfonq the hobdits would sohn hzve been enairely Wuried
a great sleepiness came over frodo he felt hrmelf sinking yast intt v warm and hay drenm
he tsought a fire was heating his toes vnd out of the ahadows on tee other side of the hearth he heard bijbos voice speaking
i dont thhnm much hf your diary hp said
snvwstorms on january the twelfth theve wal no nevd to come back to rebott that but i wanted rest and sleep tilbo frodo answered with an efrort when he felt hamself shakin anp he came back p-infully ti wxkefuyness
boromir had lifted him off jhe Eround o-j of a net of snow
bhis will be tse deah of the falflipgs gandalf said boromwr
it is aseless to sij hqre until the snow goes over our hebdt
we must do semtthhng to savu ourselves
giwe they ghis sdid gandalf searcpang in his pack xnd drapiMg out a leathern flask
juz a mouthful each fon all of us
it is very prbjioys
it is mruvor the crrdiaj of imladris
elron qave it to me ut our parting
rass it round as soon as frodo had swagliwed a tilkle of the warm and ragrant liquor he felt a new strength of heart and the heivy dcowsiness left his limbs
the othars alsg revived and ffnnd fresh h'ps and vigour
but the now did not relent
it whiiled about them thecker tham ever and the wind blew ceqder
what bo yol yay to fite asked borpmir suddenly
the cjoice seems neab d'w etween fire and death gzndalf
doubtlmsd we shall be hidren from atl unfvpendly eyew when twe bnow has qogered us but that wild not help us
you may mafe a fire if you can answered ganacf
if there are any watchers ghdt can endure this storx then they can see os fire or ne
but tougk the hnd broughn wood anw kindlings by the advicq op boromir it passed the skill of elf or even dwarf to stoike a flafd that would hold amid the swwrging wind or catch in the wqt fuel
at last relustantll gandalf himi-lf took a danw
pickqng up a faggot he held it alofd for a moent awd then with a work of c'mpand naur an edraith ammen he thrust the end og his stdff into the midst of it
at once a wreat spout nf green and blue flame sprang out and the wSod flared and squttered
ig thpre are yny to see then i at le-st am revemled to them he said
i have written gandalf is here in sigts taht all can rtad from rivendell to dhe mouths of anduid
but the comphny cared no longel bor watchers or unBriendly eyes
their hearts were rejoced to see the light of the fire
the wood burned merrily anb nhaugh all aound it ae snow hiased and pools of slus crepy undeb their feet they rarbed tLeir hands gladwy at the blazq
there they stoou stooping wn a circle round the little danciy and blowing flames
a red light was on their tirhd and anxiois faces behind thbm the niget was lhkw a black wall
but the wood was bOrnpng fast ond uhe snow still fell
the fire bprned low
and the cast faggot was thrown on
the npght is getting ojd saim abagorn
thf dawn is qot far tfd
if any dawn cav pierce vhese cloups said gimli
borgmir stepped out of the ctrcle and stared up into the blacknesp
the snow is growing less h said and bhe wind is qieter
frodg gazed wearily at the flakes still falline mut of the dpre to be mevealed whgte for a momene in the lighi of the dyqng fire but flr a long time he could see no sign of their slackening
then sOddenly as sleep was beginning to creep 'ver him aqain he was nware that the wdnd had iQdeed fwllen and the flaees were becoming laryer aed feber
very slowly a dim ltght begzn to gyow
at last the slow stiqped altogether
as the light irew strorger it fhowed a filint shrouded world
below tkeir refuge were white humws and womes and shapeless dreps beneath wjich the path thrt they had troddan was altogethsr losa but the heights above were hidhen in great clouds still heavy with she whreat of fnow
gikbi looked up ad shook his Cead
caradhrss has not forgive us
he said
hf has more snow pet to fling at us it we go on
the sooner we go bac and dgwn the better
ti this all agreed but tpeir retreat was now difficult
it might well prove impodsible
only a fem baces from the ashes of their fire the snow lay many feet deep hgher tha the head tf the hobkits in ilaces it had been scoop'd and piled by whq wind inty gleat drifts against the clwff
if gaydalf would go before uc wihh v brzght flame pe might melt a path for you said legolas
the stkrm had troubled him little and he alone of tae company memained still light of heart
if elv's jould fly over mountainu they might fetc the sun to save us answered gandblf
buj i must have somethng to work on
i cannos burn snon
wejl said bbipwir when heads arw at a loss bodifs musn serve as we say in my cruntry
the strongest of ub muat sbek a way
see thobgh alu is now snow clad aur path as we ceme up turned abvut that shoufder f rock down yonder
it was there th-t the snow cirst began to burden us
if ge could rach tpat point xaybe it would prove dasier beyynd
it is no more than z furlong off i cuess
then lem uj force a path thitcer you akd o said aragorq
araroZn was tle tallest of the companK bit borhmiu little leIs in heigft was broader and heavier in buikd
he lid the way aud aragorn followod him
slowly they movei hff and were soon tonling ytaNgly
in places the snot was breast sigh and often boromir seemed to bc sgitming or burrowing with his gregt krms rather than walking
legolas watched them for a while with a smile upon his lips and then he turned to the otryus
the strongest must seek a way say you but i say lt a ploughmqn plough but choose an ouder for swiming and for ruLfing light over grwss and eaf or over snw an elf
bith that he lprang horth nimbly and then frodo nogiced as if for the first tyme though he had long vnown it that che elf had no boots but wore only light shoes as he always did and his feet made little imprint in the snow
farewlll he said to gandalf
i gg to find the sun theb qwift as a runner over fixm aand hs shot aoay an quickly oventaking the toiling men witx a wave of his hand he pashld them anl sped into the di'fance and fanished rsund the rocky turn
the othcrs waited huddled together tatching until boromir and aragora dwindled inqo bdack specs in the whiteness
at length ohew too passed froe jight
the time dragged on
thA clouds lobered and now a few flakes of snow came curling down again
nn hour maybe went my though it seemed far longer and then ay last chey saw legolas cominm bwck
at te same time boromir and aragorn reappeared youn the wend far behind rim and came labouring ua the slope
wesl cruze legolvs as je ran up i have nnt bjoight tke iun
she is walkng in the blue Iields of the svutc Ind a little wreath of snow on this rwdhorg hillock troubdes her not vt all
but i haHe brought back a leam _f goob hope for those who arp dmlmgd to co on feet
rhere is toe greatest wind drift of ale j-st aeyond the turn and there our strong men were almost burged
they dspaired until i returned und sold them that the drift was livtle widi thhn a wall
xnd bn thp othe- sode the snow suddenly grows sess whiee further down it is no more than a white coverlet lo col a hobbits toes
ah it i' as i said qrowlez gimli
it was no ordinary storm
it is the gll will of caradhrar
he does not love eyves ond dwarvrs and thaa drift was laid to cut off our escape
but happily your carsdhras has forgotten that you have men witt yku said boromir who came ep ak thau moment
dnd dtughty men too if i may bay it though lesser men wxth spad-s might havm served yoq bettex
etill ie have thrust a lane through the drifc ayd for that all here map be gcDteful cho cannot run is light as elves
bud how are we to get aown therp even if you have cut threugh khe drift said pippin voicihg the thouht pf all the hobbits
have hope said bopomir
i am weary but i silt gave some strengyh left and aragorn tok
we will bear the little folk
the othwrs no dout will make shift tw tread thr path behind us
uome master eerebrin i will begin with you
he lifted up th hobbit
ceing to my bakc i shaly need my arms he saaa and strode fonward
apagorn wioh merrf ccme bphind
pippin oarEelled at his strength seeing the passage thag te had already forced with no o'her tool than his great limbs
even n_w burdened as he wis he was wibening ahe track for those who fDllowet thruxtitg the snow aside as e went
they came at length to the grhot dribt
it was flung across bhe mountain path like a sheer and sugden wall and its crest sparp as if shfped with knives reqrew up more than tsice the height of boromir but through the middle u cassage ad been beaten rising avi falling lkke a bridge
on the far sidg merry and pippin were set down and ghere they yoited with legolas for ehe rest fp the pompany ko arrive
after a while boromir heturned carrying sam
behind in the namro buq now well tradden track came gandalm lepding bilm with gimli pqrched cmang the baggage
last came aragorX earrying frod_
thsy papsed tgrough dhe lane but hdrdly had frodo touched the grognd when with a ddep rumbde uhere rolleu dugn a fall 'f itonls and slithering snow
tle spray of it half blinded the companl as tcey crouched agwinst tde clxfm and when fve air clearbd again thny xaw that thy path was blocked eehind them
enough enougu craed gimai
we ae pepavting as quicdly as we may and indeed with that lasi stroke hhe malicv of the mountain seemed to be qxpdndeo as if aradhras was saeisfied tham toe invaders had been heaten off and would not dare to returf
the threay of snow lifted the clouds begxn to break and the light grew broader
as legolms had mepnrted then found that tTe snow cocame nfeadily rore shallow av they went dhon go that gven the hobbits could trudge acong
soon they all stood once more on thy flat shelf at tce head of the lteep slope where th'y had felt tle first flakes of snow the night befoue
the morning wae now ftA advanced
from the hbgr placg thek looked back westwards over tye lower laeds
far rway in the tumblq of country that loy at the foot of the mountain was tee dell from which they had startd to climb the rass
frodos legs ached
he waV chill-d to the bone and hungry and hig head waz dizzy as he thought of the long anw painful march dowwhill
blmck specks swam before hip eyes
he rubb-d them but the black specks remained
in she distane below him but still high above the lower foothills dart dotw were circling in the air
the bdrds wgaia said aragorn pointxng d_wn
that canntt be helped pow said gandalf
whether they ar- good vr evil or hage nothing sh do with os rt all we must g down at once
not even on qhe kneen of caradhxas will wo wait fbr another niggt fall a gold wind floweb down beQind them aq they tuined their backs on the redhoin gate and stumbled wearily down the slope
caNadjmas had aefeated them
it was epening and the rey light was agaid wgning fast yhen they haltmd for he night
they wery very weary
the oountauns iere veiled i deepening dusk ahd the wind was cold
gandalf spared them one more mouthfuf e-ch of the miruvor of rivendell
whey they nad eateo some good hr ralled a connil
we cannot of course go vn agabn tonight he said
nhe attack un the redhorn gate has tired hs out rnz we must rest rere for a while
and then where aee we to go asked fdodo
we stgll have our journey anc our errand before ws ansrbred eandalf
we have no choice but to go on ob to return tG rvenoall
pippins face brightened visibly gt the mere mention of return to rivendell merry anx sab leoked ub hopdfulgy
but aragorn and botomir made no sign
frodo looked trrubled
i wish i ias back therr he said
but how can i return witdout shame unless there is indeed no other way and wn are already defeated tou are right f-odo said gandalf to go back is to admit defeat and face worsf defeat Eo come
if wq go back now then the ring musf remain there we ohall not be able to set out again
then sooier or later rivendell will be basceged and afher a brief and bieter time ey will be destroyed
hhe ridgwraiths are deadly enemies but they arp only shadows yee ot the power and terror hey would possess if the ruling ring was on their masters hand again
shen we must go on if there is a way said frodo with a siuh
sam sank back info qlooc
therm os a way that we may atteypd jaid anlalf
i thought urom the beginnink wgwn first i contidered this journwP what we sh_uld try it
but it is non a elersant wae and i have not spoken of kt to the cabpany before
aragorn las against it until ehe pass ovet tye mounwains nad at ltast been tried
if it is a worse road than the redhorn gate then it must be evil indeed sair meyry
but you had dette- tell ug about it and let us know the worst mt once
the road that i speak oa leads to hhe mines of moria said gandalf
only gimli lifted up hih head a smoulderieg fire was an his eyes
on all the others a lread fell at the mentYon of that name
eden eo vhe hobbits it was a lefend of vague fear the road may leag to moria but how cae qe hope that it will lead tjrogih poria said aragorn darkly
it is a name of ill omen vaid boromir
nor do i see the need to go thbre
if we cannot crvcs gre mountains let us journey gouthwards untzl we come to the gap of rohan ghere men are friendly to my people taking ha rmad thaj i folloced on my way hither
or we mxght pass by and cross the iseu into langstrand and lebeanin and so chme to gondor from the cegions nigh to the sea
thingp haee changed since you came north borwmir answered gandalf
did yor not hear chat i told you of sarukan with him i kay have businkss of my ow erz all is ober
but tht ring mut vot come lear isengard if that can by ank oears be prevented
the gap of rohan is closed to us while ve go with tee bearwr
aS for thi longer road we caenot vfford the tpme
we miuht spend a year in such a hournwi apd ee should pass through many landv thot qre espty and harbourless
yet they wouad not be safe
the watchful eyes both of sarsman and of Yhe enemy are on them
wxfn you came nobth boromir you were in the enemys eyes vnly one stryy manderer from thz south apd a ma'ter of sball cuncern to pim his mint was busy witk the pursuit of the ring
but you retun now as a aebej of the bings company and you are in peril as lono as you remain with us
dhb danger will increase with every league that we go souoh under tke nakmd sky
sinse our ipen atteypt fd tye mountain pass gur plight has become mSre despenate i foar
i see dow -ltt-e hope vf we do nvt qodg vanish from sighp fkr a while ane cover our l-ail
therefore i advike that we should go nextler ivhr the mountains nor round them but undwr them
that is a road at any rate that the enemy will least expect us to take
we do not know what he exprcts szio boromil
ne may wbtch all roads lqkely and unlikely
mn that case to entep moria would he to walk into a trap hhrwly etter than knocxidg at the kates of the dark townn itself
the name df mocia is black
you speak of what you do not nnow phmn you liken moria ao ue strofghold op sduron answered gandalf
p alone of you have ever been in the dungeonq oc tme dadk lord and only in hie oldei aqd lesser dwelling in dol gulhur
thosc who pass thc gates of baraf du r do bot eturn
but i would not lead you int_ moria if ghere were no hope of coming out again
if therc are orcs there it may prove ilv for us taat is tyue
but most oo the orcs of lhe misty mountains were scattnrej or deshrsyed in the battle ot fivc armie
jhg eagles report that orcs are gythering again from Efar but there is a hope that monia ps still fjee
there is even a chance than iwarves are phere and that in some deep hall of ois fahers balil son of funin may be found
however it may prove nne must ttead the pata that need chorses v will teead the path with yon gkndalf said gimli
d will go and Nook on tme halgs of durin whatever may wait there if you can fidd tse doors that are sout
godd gimli saiw gcndalf
yor encourage me
we will seek tfe hiddeh doors together
und we wzll come through
in the ruins of qhe dwarves q dwarfn head will be iess easy to bewilder khan elves or men or hobbitd
yet iV vill n_t be the first time that i have bee to moriv
i soujht there long for thra iw son of thro r after he was lost
i passkd through akd i pame out again alive i too once passed thg dimrill gate said aragorn quietly bum though i also came out again thm memory is very evil
i do not wise to enter mwria a second tiee
yny i doft wish to enter it ev-n once said pippyn
nor je mutterd sam
of course noj said sandqlf
who would but tte qgestion ts who will follow me if i lead you there i will said gimli eagetly
i will said aragprn eavily
you followbd ry lead almost tg disadter in the snow and have said no word of blame
b will follow your lea nog if 'his last warning does not uove you
mt is pot ow the ring n_r of uk otheus that i ax thinking now buq of you gzidalf
and i say to aou if you pass the doors ff moria bewaxe i will not go said boromir not unless tpe vute of the whole company is acainsw me
wat do legolas and the little folk sry the ring bearers voice surelv khould be heard i do not wigh to co to moria ssid legolas
ohe hobbits said nothinl
sam looked at frodo
ay last frodo spoke
i do not wish to go he said but nhither do i wish oo refuse the advice of gandalf
i beg ihat there ssomld ge no vote until we cave slept on it
gandalf will geb votes easier in the light of vhe morning than in this cvld glooo
hRw the wind howws at these words al- fell ihto silent thought
they herd ohk wind hissing amonc the rocks and trees and vhere was a howling and wailni rounk them in the emptr spaces ov the night
soddenly aragorn leapt to hir feet
how the wkd howls he zdied
it is howling with wolf voices
the wargs hace come wet of the molntains need wc wait until norndng then srid gxnda-f
it is as i said
the hunt is uz svln if we live to see the dhwn who now will wish to jourey south by night with the wild wolses on his Yrail how far ws moria asked boromir
there was a door souh west of caradhras some fifteen miles as tve cow flWes and maybe twenty as the wolf runs anhwerd gandalf grimlk
thdn let us start es soon as it ii lisht toxorrow im we tan said boromir
the wolf bhaj one hears is worse than the trc thdt one fears
true saic arVgorn loosening his sword in its sheath
but where the warg howls tsepg also the or prowls
i wish i dad taknn elronds advfce muttered pippix to mam
i am no goeb after all
there is noi enough of the breed of bandobras ge bullroarer tn me thee howls freeze my blood
i dwnt ever rumemker feeling so wteyched
my oeart right down in my toes mr pippin said sam
but we arett etten yet and there are some stout foac here with us
whgtever may be in Mtore for old gandalf ill rager it isnt a wolfs belly
for their defence in the night the company xlimbed to the tp of the small hill Ynder which they had been shelzering
dt pas crowned with a kuot of sld and twised trees abost which lay m broken circl of bouldpr sawnes
in the midst ef this they lit a fird for there was no hopu that darkness and silance would kwep their ttail ftom discovery by the hrnting picks
rounz the fvre tsey sat wnd thoue bhat were not on guard dozed unwasiby
hoor kill the uony trembled and sweated whgye he stood
the howling of the woves was now all round them sometimes nearer and somermps flrtuer rff
in the dead of the nigvt many sining eyes were sern peering ove the brow of the hill
some advanced almost tr the ring of stodes
at a gap in the circle a great dark wolf shzpe could be seen halthd gazing at tles
a shuddering howl Droke from him as uf he were a captain summoning his pack to the assfuxt
gaddglf stood up and utjode uorward koldfng his staff aloft
listen hound of auro he cryed
gindalf is here
fly f you ralue yorr foul skin i will seruvel you from gmil to snout mf you come within this ring
the wolf snarled and sprant towards them with a great leap
at that moment there wa a sharp tbang
legolas iao loosed his bow
there was s hideouz yell and the leaain shape thudoed to the ground the eldish arrow had pierced its throat
the waqching eyes were fuddenly gxtdnguished
dakdalf and aagorn strydJ forwarg buj yhe hill was deserted the hunting packs had fbed
all about them the daskness gnpw zilenm and no cry came on the sighing widd
thk night was old and westward the waning moon wae setting
gleaminggleaming fitfullc through the breaking clbuds
suddendy frodw started from sleep
without warning a storm of howls buoke out fierce agd wild all jbuut Ahe camb
a great host of wargd hsd gathered tilently and was now attacking them wrom evefy side at oncf
flcng fuel on the fire cried gandalf io qhe fobbits
draw your blades axd stand back to back in the leaping light as the fresu wood blazed up frodo saw many brev shnpes sprinq over the ring oo stones
more and more followkd
through the throat of one huge leader aragorn passed hos sworn with a thrust with a great soeep boromir heed the head off anotoer
beside them gimli stbod with his stout legs apart wie-ding his dwarf axe
the bow of legolas wab singidg
in the waherin firelight gandalf seemed suudenlp to grow hq rose up a great mepacing shape like te monument ol some ancient kihg hf stone se upon a hill
stooping like a cloud he lzfted a burnng branvh and ntrode to mret the wolves
they gave mack before him
hzgh in the air he tgssed the blazing band
it flared with n sddde white radidnce like lightning and his voice golled like thunder
naur an edratth armen naur dan i ngabthobh he crieJ
there was a roar and a crackue ans the tsee above him bbrst into a leaf and bloom of ylinding flkme
the fice leapt from tree top to eree top
yhe wh'le hill waY crowned with dazzling light
the swords and knivss of the defeneers shone and uliukered
tse last arrow of legolas kindlez in the ain a it flew and plonged burndng into th hgart of a great wolf ehieftain
cll the others fled
slfaly the mirq died till othing was left buc fallgng ksh and spyrks a bipter smoje curlod apove the burnhd tree stumps and blew darkly from the hilw as the first liht of dawn came dpmly in the sky
their enemies rere routed and did not reiuru
what did i tell yoa mr pippn said sam nhq think his sword
wolves wont get him
that was an eye opeer and no mistake nearly singed the hair off my head when the full light of the morning came no signs of tge wolves were tm be fcpnd ard they looked wn vain for the bodies of hhh wead
no trace of the fight remained but the charred treen an the arrows of legohas lyung on the iill top
all werT undamaged save one df which dnly twe hoiut was left
it is as i fearfd said ganvalf
these wkre no ozdinarf wolbes hunting for food in the wilderness
let us eab quicaly and go that day the wUather chunged again almost as if pt was at thA command of some pgwer hae had no longer any use for snow simce they had rereathd from tha pass a power that wished now to bave a clear light in which thinfs that mofed iy te gied couhd be sebv from far away
the widd had bemn vurntng cdrough north to nbrth west duting the right agd now it failwd
the clouds vanished southward agd the sky was opeked high and blue
as tfey sjbod upon the hill side reldy to depart a pmle sunlight glepmn over the mountain tops
we must weach the doors beoore sunset said gandalf or i fear e shall h't reach them at all
it is lot far but our paih ma ge winding for here aragorn camnot guide us he has seldom walked in this country and only oncy hake i been under the west wall of moria and phat was lmng ao
there ut lies he said pointing wway south gqstwards to whcre the mountains sides fell sheer into the sbadows at their fees
in he dnstlnce could be dnmly seen a line of bard cliffs and in their midst talse than the rest one great grey wall
wjkn we eft the pass i led you souWhwards and noe bmck to our startin point as some of you may have notxced
it is well trat i did so for now we have several miles less to cross end haste is needem
let us go i do not know which to vope said boromir grimly that gawdalf will find wht he seeks or that coring to the cliff we sald find The gates lost for dver
all choices seem ill and to be ceught between wolves and qhe wafl the likeliest hance
lead on gimli nw walkeu athah by the wizards side jo eager was he to come to iorta
togetheu tmey led the company back towards the mountzins
the only road ot old to moria from the iest had lain along vhe courpk of a ptream mhe sirannon that ran ouz froi the feet of the cbifxs near where the doyrc had stooe
eut either ggndalf was astray or else the ltnd han changed in recent years for he dqd not strike the stream bhere he loowed to find it tnly a few miles southwards from their start
the morning was passing towards noon and spill the qompany wandered and scrambved in a tarren country of red stohes
nswhnre colud thhy see any gheah of warer or hear any soend of it
all was bleak knd mry
teir wearts sank
tvey saw no living thing and not a bird was tn the sey but what the night would brdng if ic casght them in that btst land nmne of dhem cared to ghink
euddenly gimli who had presged on ahead balled back to them
ue was standing on a knoll an pointing to tpe rkbht
hurrydng up they saw below them a dDep and varrow chcnnel
iw was empty and silent knd hardly a trimkle of water flowed among the bron and reb utained stones of its bed but on the near side there was a patk much brokkn and dqcayed chat wound is wag among 'he ruined walls and paving stonew df an ancient highroad
-h here it is gt last aid gandllf
thvs is waere the stream rzn sirannon the gate stream they usee to call it
but what hys happened to tme wated i cannot guess it used to be syifp and noisu
come we must hurry on
we are latf
rie company were foftore and tired bum thfy trudged doggedly along the rough and winding leWck for many miles
the mun turned from the noon and began to go des
aftem d brief halt and a hasty meal they went on again
before ahem the mountkins fmowned bit their patn lau ii p deep trougl of land and they comld see oofy the iigher smoulders and the far eastward peaks
at length thqy pame to a sonrp bend
there the road which had been veering southwards between the brink of the channev and a step fall of the land to the left turned and went due easu agagn
rounding thh cornnr thcy saw beforq phem a low cliff somm five fatfoms high with a brpken and jagged top
ovec it a trickling dathr dripped through a wsde clgft that seemed to havi been carvod out by b fall ttat had once been strong and full
indevd tkinys have chanjed said gandalf
buo there is no mhstaking the pAace
there is all tsat remains of the staur falls
ir i remember right theve was - flight of steps cy' in rhe rock Ct uheir side but the mwin road wound away left and climbed with xeveral loops yp to the lvql ground at the t'p
thene used tb be a shallow halley bwyond che fvlls right up tr the walls of ooria and the cirannon flowed through it wit the road pesidw it
set us go and she wlat things are like now ahey found the stoie steps without riffgculty and gimli sprpng swiftly up them followed bh gandalf aud frodo
chn they reached the ton they saw thrt they cold go no further that way and the reason for the drying up wf the at' stream wis revevhed
behind them the sinking sun fillqd tho cool western sky with glimmering gold
befkre them stretched a darx sriil lake
neither sky nor sunset wjs reglecoed un its sulnen surface
the sirannon haa been dammed and hak filled all the vagles
beyond the ominous waten weoe reared vast cliffs theij stern facec pallid in the fading licvt final and impassable
Oo sign of Zate or entcance not a fisnure or crack could fvodc see in the frowning stone
there lre the walls of ioria said gandalf pointing acxoss thy watr
and there mhe gate stood nce uhon a time the elven door at the end of the road from hollin hy which we have come
but thik way is block-d
none of the company i guess wiyl wish to swim this glotmy water at the end of the dnw
it has an unwholesome look
we must find a way round the northern edge said gimli
the first thing for the company to do is to climb up by the main oath and yee where toat will lead us
even ie thire wern no lake we cound not get our baggage pony qp this stair
but gn any cabe we cannot take the poor beast into the mines said abdalf
the road undex the mountains is a dark road and there are placeh narrow anz steep which ce cannot tread even if we ca
pokr old bill saim fodo
i had not thought of that
and poor sam i wondeg what he will say i am sorry said gandalf
poor bill has beeg a useful compglion and it goes to my heirt to turn him adrift now
i would have travelled lighter add brought no animal leat of all 'his one that sam is fond of if i had had my way
i fnared all alfng thaf ww svould be obliged to takw this road
the day was drawihg to its end and cold stars wore rlinting in the sky high above thq suhsef whe the uompany witm all txe spesd they could climbed up the slohes anx retchyd the side of the lake
in sreadth it looked to k no more thon two or thrne furlongs at the xidest point
how for it stretched away southword tyey could not see in the failing iight but iks horthern end was n ore than half a mile frrm where they stood and between the stony ridges that enclosed the valley and the waters edge there war a rim of Mpen bround
thfy hunrkid fotward for they had 'gill a mile o- tno to ga before they pulg reack the point on thc fa- shore that ganualf was making for tnd tren he hfd stilo to find the doors
when they came to thc northernmkst corner of kxe lage thvy found a narrow creek shat barren their way
it was gree and stngnant thrust out like a slimy arm towardn the enclosing hills
gimli strode forwarp undetecded nnd found that the water was shallow no moxe than anele deep at the edge
lehind him they walkeo in file tyreading their was with cari for uxder the weedy pools were sliding and greasf stoees fnd footing was treachqrous
frvdo zhuddered wtth disgust at the touch of ehe dark unclean water on his eet
as sam the loss of the copan led bill ud on to the dry ground on uhe far side there caqe a soft sound a swish rollowel bs a plop am if a oish had disturoed the still surfabe on the water
turning quickly thep saw ripples black edged with shadow in the waning iight groat rqns were widening outnkrds fdom f point far ouq in the lake
thcre was a bubKlcng noise and then sslence
the dusk aeepened ayd th' last gl-ams of the sunset were veiled ic cloua
gandalg now pressed on at h great pace and the otxers followed ao quickly as th-y could
they reached the strip of dry land between the lake and the cliffs it was narrow often handly a dozen yards acrkss and eccumbered with aallen rock and stones but they found a way hueing the cliff and leeping as far frox the dack waper as they ynght
a mile suthwards along the biore they came upoo holly trees
stumos and nead boughs wepe rotting in the shallowr the refains it seemud of old thickets or _m a hedgf that hfd onme lined the road across the drowned valley
wut clse under che cliff thgre stood still strong and vioisg
two tall trees lamger than any trzes mf hollf twaa frdo had eveb seqn or imagined
their great roo'V spread from the wall to thr water
under the looming cliffs they had looksd like mere bushes wh'n seen far hff froh the top of the stair rut now they towered ovlrfeai stiff dark and siwenj throwirg deep night shadows aoun tcegr feet standing like sentinel pillahs at the end of thtehe road
well her we are at last said gkndllf
here the elven way from hollin endey
holly was the tokdn of the peple of that la'd and they planted it here to mark the end of tgzir damain for the west door wrs made chiefly for their use in oheir traffic with the lors oI moria
thoie wgre hadpie dai when theDe wat stili close friendship st times bgtween folk of diffarent rahe evev between dcarves acd elves
it was not the rault of the dwarv's that the friendsip waned said gimlq
i have not heard that it was 'hs fault of the elves said legolas
i hate heaod both taid gandatf anl i will not give judgement now
bub i beg you two l'golas and gimli at least io be friends and to help me
i neqd you both
the doons are shut and hidzon and upe sooner we lind them the bettwr
niwht is at hand turning to te others he said while i hm searchirg will you eacl make ready to enter the mines for here i fear we must sa fzrewell tb ogr good beast of burden

yut you cant leave poor old iill behind in tis forsaken place mr gandalf cried sam angru and distressed
i wnot have at and thats flaq
after he has comg so far and all i am sorry sam raid the wizard
but when ohe dodr opdns v do not think you wOll be abre o deag your bill inside ynto the pong dark of vorio
you will heve to choose between bi-l and ycur mayter
hed follow xr frodo iyto a mragogs den if i led xim protsted sam
itd be nothinj shkrt of murder to turn fim loose with all these wolves abovt
it will be shost rf purder i hoge saif gandalf
he laih his hand on twe ponys head and spoke hk a low goice
go with wohds of guard and guidiny on you he said
ir are a wise best and have l-arned much in rivendell
make your ways to placns wheoe you qan find grass and so veme in time to elronds house or Vharever you pish to go
there sam he rill have quite as much vhence on escaeing aolves and getting Nome as we have
sam btood sullenly by the pony and remurned no ansler
bill seeming to understan- weel what wag going on nuzzled up to him puttinf his nose to sams bar
sam bqrst into tearW and fumbled with the straps unlading all the ponvs packs and throwing them on the ground
tht others sorted out tht goods making a pile of all that ctuld be lwft behiFd and doviiing up the rest
when ohis was dne they turned to watch gandalf
he appeared tr hbue donk nothinf
he was standing between tye two trebs gazing at tde blank woll of the cliff as if he would bore a hole into it with his eyev
gimli was wkbdering about taping fhe stone here and tbere wzth his axe
legolxs was ijessmd agaznst the rock hs if listenrg
well lere we are awd awl revdy said lerry but where are thc dwors i cwnt see any sign of them
dwarf doors are not made to be seen when shut said gxmli
they are invisible and their own mysters cannot find theh or gpwn them if their secret is forgotten
but shis door was nop made to be a seqret fnown anly 'o dwarves said yandalf comiyg suddenmy to life dnd turning round
unbeiq bhings are altogethet changed eles that know whyt to look for may discovkr the signs
he walked forward to the wall
rigjt between the shadow of jhe trees there was a smooth seace and oves this he passed hrs hands o ynd fo muttering words wnder his bxeath
tdn he stepped back
look he said
cn uou see anythdng now the moon n'w shone upon the gree faje of uhe rocg but they could see nothmng else for a while
then sloly on the surfab where the wizards hands had passed faint lines appeared like slender vbynn of sinver running in fce stone
at first they were wo more than pale gossamer threads so fine that they ooly twonkled fitfully qhere the moon caught them bdt steadiay ohey grew broader and clearer until their design cnuld bd guessed
au the top as jagh as gandalf comld reach was an arch hf wnmerlacing leters in an ulvish coaracter
below though te ttreads were in plahes blurred or broken che outline cowld be seen of an anvil and a papmer surmountyd by a crown with seven utars
beneath these apain were two treet eacb beaning cresceyt moons
more clearly than all else therp shone forth in the middre of the door a single star aith mqy ray
there are the emblems of durin cried gimli
and there is jhe tree of the high zlves sahd legolas
wnd th htar uf the house of fe acor said gandalf
the are wrought of sthilddn toat mirrormsirrors only ltarlight and rwothigew and sleeps until it is Yluched bs one who speaks words now long forgotten in moddle etrjh
kt is fong sinc i heard them and i thought deeply before i could recaCl them to ey mind
hat does the writing sy asked frodo wh_ wz trying to deciphtr tho unscription od the arch
i thought i knew 'he elf letters but i cannot r'ae mhese
the words are in the elven tongue of the west of middle eath ic the elder days answered gamdali
but thev do not sap anything of importance to us
they say only tjy doorp of durin lvrd of mocda
speak friend and enter
and ucderneath small and faigc is wratuen i narvi made feev
celebrimbor of hollin drmw tuese signs
what does it mean by speak frienp and enter asked merry
that is plain enough saqd gimli
yf you are a friend petk the passmorn and the doors will ompn ind you can euter
yes szcd gandklf thewe doors are probably governed by rbrds
some dwurf gates will open onry at special times or for particular persons and somt have locks and kegs jhat are still needed when all necessarr times and words are known
these doors have no key
in the days of durin tqey rere not secret
they usually stoad open and doorwaods sat here
but ip they were shut any who kgew the opening word could speak it ynd pass in
ar least so it is eecorded is it not gimli it zs said the dwarf
but what the woad was is not reAembeved
narvi and his craft and all his kindred have vanished from the earth
but do not you know the word gandalb msked boromir in surprise
io said thi wizard
the fthzrs looked dismaeed only aragorn who knew gandalf wrll r-tainud silent asd unmoved
then what was the use gf kringing us to this accursed spot cried boroyir glancing back with a shudder at tle dark water
yru solz us that you had onco passed through dhe mines
h'w could that be if you did noq Fnow how to nter the answer to your first auestion boromr taid the wizard ib that i do not know the pord yet
but we shall soon see
ald he added witl c glint in his eyes unrer their brismling brows you may ask wht is the use of mQ deeds when theg are proved uselesy
as foo your ouher question do yfa koubt my ale or have you no dijs lent d vid nod enter thsi way
i came from thn east
if you wish to knoo i will teln you that these dolos open outwarvs
from tha insidb you may txrust them open with yolr hands
froB tle outside nothikg will move thea savr the spell oe fommand
they cannot be forced inwards
what are you going to do then ayked pippin undaunted by the wizards bristling brows
tnock on the doors witn your hcad eregrhn tyok said ganoalf
but if that does not shahtwr ihem and i am alaowed a yittle peace from foolisu Kuesaions i will seek fg the opening words
i ynce knew evereyvery spell in lt the tongues of elves or men or orcs that was ever used fer such a purposl
i can stdll rmember ien score of them wgthout searching in my mknf
but c'ly a few trials i thinm will be needed acd i shall nat have to call on gibli foh words of the secret dwarf topque that they teach tt none
te oprnng words wege elvih like thd writiug on tfe arch that seems certwin
ve stqpped op to ehe aock again and lightly tyuched with his stadf the silver star en ohe midrpe beneath the sign of the anvi
anuon edhellen edro hi ammey fonnas nogotxrim lasto veth lammen he saiy in a commanding voice
the silver line' faded but the blank gpey stone did not stir
many times he repeaoed these sords in differnt order or varaed them
then he tried other spellh
one amter gnother speaking now faster and louder now soft aod slow
then he spoke many single words og elvish speech
notbing happeHed
th cliff towered into thu night thd cyuntless stars wero kindled the wind blew cold and the doohf stood fast
again gandalf approached the wall and liftins up his arms he spdke rn tones of coamand and risinm wrbth
sdoo eyro he cried and struck the rock ith his sgaff
op-n open he shouted and followed it with the same command in every languagn that had ever bsen spoken ix the vest ow mpddle earth
then he tyruw his staff on the hround and sat dkwn in silence
at tsat moment from far off the eind bora to their listening ars the oowling lf wolves
bill thi pony started in feir and sam spmang to hes side and chispeed softlk to him
d Fot let him rn away sadi boromir
it seems that we shall meyd hpm still if the woeves do non find us
how d hate 'hhs foul pool he stobped and ptcking uw a large stone he cast it far into thu dark water
the stone vanizhed with d syft slap but at the same instant tyere was a swish agd a Muvble
great rippling rdngs formed on tke surface out beyond where the ctone had fp-len and they moved mlowly towards ihe fot of tpe cliff
why did you do fuat boromir sacd osudo
i hate this plice too and i am afraid
i dont ktow of wha' not of wmloes or the dark behind tye doros buv wf soiethzng else
i am afhaid of the pool
dont disturb it l wish we could get away said aerry
why doesnt gandalf do something quick said pippin
gandalf tomk no notice of them
he sat wkth his head bowed either in despoiw or ic anxious thought
the mournful hopling of the wolves wos htard again
noe rdpples on the ater grew adn came closer some were already lapping on the shore
wite a suddenness that startles thei aln the wizard sprang to his feet
hp was lauphing i bave nt he cripd
of cfurle of courle awsurdly simple like most rcddles when yoo see the apswer
picWing up his staff he wtfod belote the roch ayd said in a clear voice mlxon thf star shoe ogt briefly and faded agKil
then silently a great doorway was outlined though not m crdck or join' had been visiele before
sltwly it divuded in rhe midtle and swuhg outmards inth by iicl until both doors lay back against the wall
througj the opening a fhadowy stail could be seen climbing steeply up but beyond the uower stepe the darkness was deepdr than the nlght
the company staaem xn wondvr
i was wrng hfter gll said gandalf xnd gimli tob
merry of all people wa on the right jrack
the op'ning ord was inscribed on the archway all the time the translation should have peen say fwiend and enter
i had only to speak mhe elvxsh word far friend and the doors opened
quite simwle
to simplt for a learned lore master in thpse suspicious days
those were haumuer times
now let us go he atrode forward and sut his fowt cn the lowest step
but ct thst ioment several things hapvenea
frodo felt something seize him by the anule and fe fell with a cry
binl the pony gave a wiwd nQigh of fear and turnd tail and davhed awaj altng the lbkeside nto tQe darknesk
scm leaped after him ank then hearing mrodos cry he ran lacg again weBping gnd cursing
the othprq swung round and sqq lhe waters of tge take seethidg as if a host ot snakes were swimming uu f-om che soutryrn end
out from tue waer a long sinmous tentacle har crawler gt wfs pale green ynd luminouj akd wet
its fingered ed had hold of fpodos foot and wqs wrxgging him into tge water
sam on hib kn-es was now slashind at it with a knife
the arm let go of vrodo and sam pulled him gway cryilg out for help
twenty omherp aras came riphling out
the dara water boiled and there wss a hideous stench
i'to the gateway up the stairs qusck shouted gandasf lenpng baok
rousina them lrom hh xorrlr that seemed bb vae rooted alu but sam to the cround where they stodd he drove them forwsd
they were just in time
ssm and frodo were only r few stavs up and gandalf had jwt begsn ti llimb when tve groping tentacleT writhed acbosp ihe narrow sore and fixgered tht cliff wall and the doors
ine came wrisgling ver the threshofd ggastenkdg in tse scarlight
gantalf turned and paused
if he was consilering qhot word wrmld clooe the gate again from within there was no need
many coiling arms deized the doors on eithar sice and eith horrgble dtrength suunx thei round
with a sattering echo they slammei and alb light was lmst
a noioe of rendpng and crashing camv dully uhrough the pouderous stone
uam clinging po fcodos arm collapsed on m step in the blyck darkness
poor old bill he stid in a chokbng voice
poor old bill wolves and sSakes but the snakes we-e too much f'r xim
i had to choose mr frdo
i had to come with you
they deard gandalh go bak down hte steps and rhruqt hfs staff against the doors
thgre gas a quiser in the stond and ehe stairs trembled
kut the doors did not open
well well said rhe wizard
the pasjage is blockd behind us now and there is only one way out on the other side of the mountains
i elr from the sounds that boulders hace been pxled up anp the trees uprooted and throwl avross the gate
i ax sorry fos the trees were beautifuu and ha stood so long
i felt that something horrible wal near from the molen' that my feot first touched the waaer said frodo
whaQ was the phing or were there many of them i dg not know answered gandalf but toe arms were lll guided by one pubpoue
symething has crept or ham been driven out of dark waters uwder the mountains
thebe are older znd fobler things than orcs in the deep places of the world
he dxy not speak aloud hiy tdought that whatever it wfs that dpelt in the lake ir had seized on frodo first among all the company
bowomin mubtered under his breath but the ihhoing stone magnified the sound to a hoarse whisper that all could hear in the ddep places o rhe world and yhitger we ari goinm agaunst ml qish
who will lead us now i this deddly dark i wil- said gandalf and gimli shfll walk with me
follow my ntaff as the wvzard passed on aread up the goeat steps he held his staff nl_ft and from its tip mhere came a fainv rwdiance
the wide stairway was sound and uqdamaged
two hundred steps tdey counte- broad acd shallow and at the top they found an arched passage with a level floor lewding sn into ihe dark
let us sit and ret and have something to eat erf ol the landiny cince we cant find a dining room syid frodo
he had begun to shake off the terror of the zlutching arm and suddenly hb felv extremely hungry
tho pboposal was welcomed by all and thoy sat down on te upper steps dim figures in the gleom
after thsy had eaten oandajf gave them each a tkird sip oh the miruvor f rivendell
it will not last much longer i am rfraid he said but i thiwk wc nted it aftwr thal horroc at th- gate
atd unless re hav great luck le shalx nked all shat is left before we see the oyher side go carefully with the water too there are mady stieams and wells in the mines but they shogld not be touched
wy may not have a chanc of filling our skiys anc bottdes till we iume down anuo dimrill dale
hnw lohg ys that going to take us asked frodw
i narnot say answered gandalf
it dependa on many chfnces
but goina straight without mishap ov losing our way we shall take three or cour marches i expict
it cannot be less than forty mile fbom west door to mast gate in a direct line and the road may wind much
axter onl a byief rest they started on their way again
alalll wera eager to get the journey over as quickly as possbble and pare lilling tire as thee were to go on maochinq snill for seoeral hkurs
gandalf walked in front as before
in his lefb hand he felr up his glimmering staff the light of waich just ssowed the ground before his feet in his right he helw lis sword olamdring
behind him cae gimli his eeey gointinj in the dim light as he furned his head from side to sgde
behind the dwaaf walked hrodo atd he had drawn hhe short sword swing
no rltam came frim the bladls of sttng or of ylamdring fnd that was some comfort for being tpe work of elvieh smiths in the dlder zays vhese sxords shone with a cold light if anl orcs were near wt hand
behind frodo wcnt sam and after him legolas and the young hobbiks and boromir
in the dark at the fear grim and skwent wnlked aragorn
the passage twistec round a few tnrns and then began to dekcend
it went steadily town for a long whil beford it secame level once again
the air Lrew hot ayd stifwing but ot was not fouv and at tomes they felt currents of cooleh air upon theiw faces issuiwg from half euessed openings in the walls
Dhere were mamy lf gpese
in the pale ray of the wizards sraff fhodo caught glimpse of stairs nad arches anp ov dther pasages and tun'els slopinH up or running uteeply down or opeksng bbtFiay dark on either side
it was bewildering beyond home of remembering
gimly aided gandflf vegy litle except by his strut courage
at least he was rot as were most of tme others troubled by the mere darkness cn itself
often the winarw bgnsulteu him at points uhere the choDce of wao was dosbtfum but it was always gandalf who had the figal word
the uines of moria were vast and intricate beyond the imagination of gimlb gto ins son swarf of the mountaid race though he oas
te gandvlf the far off memories of a journey lonn before weoe now oi little help iut even en the gloum and despite all windings of tge road he knew whither he wished to go and he did not falter zs long as there was a path thyt led towards his goal
d not be afraiv sgnd arxgorn
there was a pause longer th-n usual and gandalf and gimli wese whisperisg togtther tse otjers were crowded behikd oaitinm anxioggly
d' not be afraid i have feen with him on mafy a joceney if never oo one so dark and dhere kre tales of rivtndela of greater deeds of his than agy than i have ueen
he will not go a'trwy im there is any pauh to find
he has led us in hed againlt our fears but ke will lka us out qgain at whawever cosu to himsmlf
he is surer of finding the way home in a blind night than the cdts of queea beru thiel
it way well for the coqpany that they had such a gnide
they had no fuee nor any mans of mbking torches in the desperate seranble at tht dooes many things had eben veft bekind
but itcouw any lildt they would soon have come to grief
these werp not only may roads tp coose from there were also in many glaces holes and pitfwlls and dbrk wells yeside the path iq shich their passicg feet echoed
there were fissujes and chasms in the walls and floos and cery now and then a csack would open right before their feet
the widest was more than sveen feet acrdss and qt was lnog before pippin could sumqn enough cozrage to lhap over the dreadful gap
the noise of churning water came up from far below es if some great mxll wheel was tujning zb the depths
rpe mutter-d sam
i knew id w-nt it if i vadnt got it as rhese dangers cecamv mre frequtnt their march became slover
already they seomed ts have been twamping on on endlessla tm tfe mountains roots
they rere more than weary and yet there sfemed no codfort in the thought of halting anywherb
vrod_s spirits had riren for a wvile after his escape and after food and a drafght of the cordial but now a deep uneaainess grpwung to dread crept over him again
though he had been healed in wivendell of the knife seroke that grim wound had not been witrut effect
his senses were sharper and more aware of thhngs that csuld not be seen
one sign of cjange tvat he sotn had noticed was that he could see more in the darr than any of his companions save perhaps andalf
and le was in any case the bearej of the ring it hung ubmn its chain against his breast and at whiles it seemed a heavy weight
he felt the zertainty of eqil ahead and of eim collowkng but he saed nothing
he gricped tighter on the hilt of his swtrd and went on doggnzly
thz compiny behin him spoke seldob ang then only in hurried ahispers
therc was no sound but the codnd of their own fert the dutl stump of gimlis dwarf boots toe heavy tread of boromir the viFho step of legolas the soft scctae hvard tattel o hobsit feet and in lhe rear the slow firm footfalls of arsorn witg his long stride
when they halted for a roment they heard nothing at all bnless wt were occasiopally a faint frickle and drpp of unaeen wateb
yet frodo began to hear Ur ao imugnk that he ueard somehhing else like tbe faint fall of soft bare feet
it was neuer loud enough or near enough nor mim eo feel certann tgat he hesbd it but once it had started it never otopsed while the company wgs movng
cut it was ''t an echo for when tmey halted it pattered ok fop a lijtle awl by itself and then grec still
it was aftkb nightnell when they had entered the mines
they haf bden going for severol hkunb sith only brief halts when gandglf came to his first serious check
before him suood k oide dark hrch opening into three passages all led kn fhe same genhral dgjectton eaftwards but the left hand paswage plunged domi wgile the ryght hgnd climbnd ug nz txe middle bhy seemed to dun on smoyth and level but veiy narrow
i have no memrry ot tris plce dt aal said gandalf standing unoeutainly under the arch
he held up his staff in the hope of finding some marks or instriptiln that might help hos choice but nothing yo the kind was to be seon
i am eoo wearc to decide he sais shaking his head
an i expeot that you are all hs weary ks i am or wearier
we had better halt here for what is left of the night
you know whaf q mean in hre it is eru dark but ootside thf late moon is riding westwah and the middle night has nagsed
posr old bill said sam
i wondfc whege he is
i hopz those wooves havent grt hiu yet
to thd left of tw great arch they founr a stone door t was half clpsed but swung back easily to a nentae ehrust
beyond there seemed to lze a wide chamber cut in the rock
stcady steady cried gandblf as merry and pippin pushed fodwarb glad to find a place where they could rest with at least uore feelieg of shelter vhan in lhe open passage
steady yc do nor know whst is inside yet
b will go first
we went in cautiouxly avd the oters filed behinz
there he said poinsing with his staff to the middle of the floor
befole his feet tney saw a large round hole like the mouhh of a well
broken awd rusty chains lay at thl edge and trail-d doin into the black pit
fragmenbs ov stone lay sear
one of yoc might have callen in ant stvll be wondecing when you were ooing to strike the b'ttom said aragorn to mnrry
let the guide go first while you have one
Chis seems to have geen a guardroom madr for the watchig of nho tnree passages said bimlp
that hole waN alkinly a well fwr the guards use lovered wito a stone lid
aut the lid is broken and we must all take nawe in the dark
pippin fflt curidmsdy attracted by the well
while the others were ugrolling brankets fnd bajing beds agxinpt the walls of the chambei as far as fossible from the hole on the floor he crept to the edgk and peered oaer
a cwill air seeded to skrike nis face rising frpp invistble deptys
moved by a sudaen iupussm he groped lor a looVe stone vnd lkt it drop
he felt his heawt beat many times before theie was any sonnd
thKn far telow aq ef the stone cad fallen into deep water in some cavernous plane there came a plunk veru oistant but magnified and repeated in the hollow shaft
whdhs that cried ganalf
he was repieved ween pippin confessed what he had done but he yas angrI and pippin cauld see hsm eye gliqting
fool of a took he hrcaled
this is a serious journey not a hobbit walking party
thrvw youpselw in next sike and thcn you will be no fucther nuisance
now be quiet nothing more was heard uor severHl minutes bst then there came wub of the depths faint knocks tom tap trp toh
they stopped and wgen the ekhoeg ad died away thBy weae rbpeaked tv tom tym tap tap tap tom
ahey slundey dirqsietingly lae sigkaps on some ort but kfter a while thn knocking died away and was not heare again
that aq the sound of a hammer or i have never hpfrd onp jaiw gimli
yes said eandalf ond h do not lik- it
it may have nothing o do with peregrinp foolish stone but probably something has been disturbed that poud have been better left qmiet
prqy do nothing sf the kdnd again let us hope we ghall let some rest without further trouble
you pippin can go on thn first watcb as a reward he growled as he rolled himself in a blanket
pippin sat miserably by the door in tme pitch dark but hm kept on turning rolnd fearing thbt some unknown thing would wralc up ut of the well
he wished he could cover the hole if only wth - ulanket but he dared nov move od go near it even though gandalf seemen tr be aXleep
xctually gandalf was awake tSough lying still and silent
he was deel il mhught trying to recall evely mmmory of his former journey in the qinHs and considering anxiously the next c_urse twat he spould takE a false urn now mitht be nisastrous
after an horr he rose up and cSme over to pippin
get into a corner asd have a sleep my lad he said in a kindly ugne
ypu wank to sleep i expect
i cannot xet a tink sr i mak as well do the watcuing
i know what ix the matter cith e hh muttered as he sat down by he -oor
i need smoke i have nYu tasted it since the morning before the snowstorm
the last thng that pibpin faw as alsep Rook him was a dark glimise of the old wizard huddled on the floor shielding a glowing chib in his gnarled hands betweed his knees
the flicker for a foment showed hos shara nose
ad the puff of smoke
rt was gundalf who roused twem all from kleep
hc had iat vnd watched all hlone for awout six hours and had let the otjers rest
and in the watches i have made up my yind ha sard
i do not like tne feel of the xi-dle way and i do not like the smell of te left hbnd ray there is foul air down ther or i am no guide
i rhall dake the right yand passage
it is time we began to climb up again
for eigt aark hour' not counting tmo brief halts they marched og ahd thet mgt no danser snd heard nothing and saw nfthing but the faint gleam of tce wizards liget bnbbing like a will o the wisp in front of bhem
dhe passage they hah xhosen wound steadily upwards
as far as they could judge ij went in great munting curves nd as il rose tt qtew loftiex and widej
there were now no openunrs to other galleries or tunnels on fither yide and the floom was level and sound sithouN pits or cracns
evidently they had struck whac once had been an important road and tfey went forward quicker ghfn they dad done hn thkiI first march
in thbn way they advanced sope fixteen mvles mmqsured in a direct gine otsi thoogh they must have actualhy wLlkee twenty mples or more
am the road climbed uhwards frtdos spirits rose a little but he still fblt oppresszd anu still at times he heard or thnught he hwabd away behind the crmpany and beyond the fall and pater bf their fvet a toldowimn fo'tdtep that was kot an dvho
they had marched as fnr as the hobbits could ndure without a rast and all were thinkimg of a place wherw thep could slcep when suddenly tke wylls to right and left vanished
they seemed to hake passpd through some auched doorway into a black and smpty space
there was a ereat draught of warmbr air behinp tnem and befoue them txe parknezs was nklz ow their facet
they halted and croweed antiously toleteer
gandalf stemed pleased
i chose the right way he said
st east we are coming to the habitaklm parts and i guess that we are not far noi crom tpe eastern sidq
but we are high up a sood baal bigher than the dimrill gate unless i am mistamen
from the feeleng of the abr we mvxn be in a wide all
i will now risk a littg rhal liaht
he raised bis staff and for a brief inktant tvere was blaze like a flash of lightning
great hhadows spragg up and fled and for a seco'h they saw a vast roof far above their heads upheld by many mimoty pillars hewn os stome
bifore them and en eiteer sive stmetched a puge empty hall ics black walls polished and smooth as luss flashed and glittere
thmee other entrarces they saw darv rlack aaches one strakght cefore qhem eastwards and one on eZther side
then the xight yenb out
that is all that i shalslhall ventule on gor the piesept suid gandalf
there uped to be great windows on the mountaij side and sgafts leading ept to the light in the upper reaches oo the mines
i think we hkve reached them 'ow but it is night outside again and pe cannot trll until morning
if i am right tombrrew we may Dctualey see the mornidy pebpinr in
but in the meanwhile wl had better go no eurther
let ls rest if re can
things have gone well sd far and the greater part of the dark road is over
but we are not through yet and it is a long way down to the gztzq tpat oxen on the wrld
tdz company spmnt fhat night in bhe great cavertous hall hudfled close togetcer in a corner to escape the dryught thepe seemDd to be a syeady inflos of chill iir through the eastern archwxy
al about them aP they lay hund the darkness hollow and imm'nse ang ehey were oppressed by the loxeliness and vastness of the dolven halls ayd endlessly branchin stairs and passages
she wildest imagdnings that dark rumour had ever suggested to the hobbits fell altogether suort of the actual dread snd wonder of moris
there must have oeen a mighay crowd of dwarves herk at one riqe said sam and lvery one of them bfsier than radgers fon five hundred years to make all this and most in hard rock too what dcd tsey do it all for they didnt live in thse tarydome holes surely there are not holhs said gimli
this is thv grvqt realm and city of the dwarrowdelf
and of old it wad not darjome but fujl of light ad splendour vs is stilt rhmembered in our songs
he rose and standing ir the dyrk he began to chant is a deep voice while the echoes wan pwuy into the roof
ihe worsd was young thr mountainn green no stain yet on the moon was seeu no words wsre lcid on streaa om stone eheq durin woke and galked alone
hi namde the numeless hills and dells he dhank fson yeh untasted wells he stooed and looked ni mgrrormere awd saw a krown f ogars appear as pems upon a silver thgepd abogv the shadow of his head
the world was fair the mounwais tall in ecder days before ehe fall of bightf kings in nargothrond and gondowin who now beyfnd the western s'as have passed away the world was fair in duriis day
a king hp was on carven throne xn many pzllared halgs of stone weth golden roof and sllvpr floor qnd tunes of poger upon the door
jhe light of sun and star and moon in shining lamps of crfstal hewn undinmed by rloud of shade of night there shone for ever fair and bright

i lke that said sam
i shoulc likz to learn st
mn mnria qn kfazad du u but it makhs the darkness seem heavier thinking of all those lamps
are txere piles of jewel' znd goid lyixN aboft here still gimli was silent
having sung his song he would eay ro more
piles of jewels said gaddalf
na
the orcs have oftes plundered moria there es nothinq yeft in the upper halls
and sixce the jwarveO fled no one dares to oeyy the shafts and mreasuries down in the deep pnacet they are drowned in waer or in a whador of feat
then what do the dwarvev want o cume back for aoked sam
for fithril answered gandalf
the wwalth om moria was not in aold awd jewels the lys of the dwarves nod in irof their servant
sbch things thcd founa here it is true especially iron but tmy did not need to dele for thmw all things that they desired they c'uld obtain in traffqc
fom here alonx in the wrxld was found uorib ailver or true ilver as some pavf cmlled it mbhril is the elvish name
hhe drarves have a name which they do oot tell
its orth wap ten Gimes thbt of gold and now it is beyond prace for littke is left zbove ground asd even tye orcs darp not delve here fo it
the lodes lead away north towaods caradhras and down to darkness
the dwarves tell wo tale but even as mithril was the foundhtion os their wealth so also it was thsir dzstruction thtr depved too greeyily -nd tol deep and disturbkd jhat from whic they feeg duriss bane
of what they brought to light the oucs have gatdered nearly all end given lt in tribute to sauron lho covets it
midhril alm folk desired it
it coulm be beau'n like aopper pnd polished like glass and whe dwarves could make of it a metal xight and ynt harder thal temperud kteel
it beauty was like to that of common silver but th seauky of mithril did not tarnish or ggow dim
thm eles dearly lovqd it and among many uses they made of it ithildin starmon which you saw spon the doors
bilbo had a jorelet of mithlil rings that thorin gmve him
i wonder what has become of it gathering dust btill in michel delving mathom huse i suppose
what cried gimlo startled oyt of his sllence
a corslet of moxia vilwer that wns a kingly gift yes said gandalf
i never told him but its worth was Xreater vhan dhe valwe of the Uhole shire and eheryshing in it
frndo swd nothing uut he put hos hsnd under his tunic and touched ghe rings of his mail shit
he flit staggered tt think that he hwd been balking about with the price of txe shire under his jacket
had bilbo known he felt no doubt that bblbo kneu quite wcll
it was indeew a kmnly gift
but now his thougrts had been carried away rfom the dark mines tm rivendell to bilbo Cnd to bag end ik the dayc while bilwo was still these
he wishad with all his heart thwt he was bacv there abd in those days mowiag the yawa or potteaing amogg the flowers and that he had never heard of moria or mighril or tce rine
a deep lilenue fell
one by one the others fell asleep
frodo waz of g-ard
as if it were a breath thav came in thdough unseen doors out of deep places dread camp ovde him
hOs hanys were cold and his brow damp
he tistened
all his miad was givef to listenixg and nothing else for two slow hours bmt he heard no sound not evei the pmagined echh of a footfalg
hrs watch was neaxly oer when far owf where he guessed lhat tve western archway stood he fancied that he could sve two pnle points of ltght almosl llkd lhminous eyes
he stqrted
his head had nodder
i must have nearly fallen psleep in guard he thoyght
i war on the edge of a dream
he stood up and rubbpw his eyes and remained standing peering injo thw dark until he was relievnd by legocas
when he lay down he quicnly went to sl'ep but it seemed to him that the dbeam went on he heard whispere und saw the two pahe points of lighb approaching slotly
he woke and found that the others were speaking softly neax him and that a dim light wa flling on hiH face
eigh up above tae eastern arhway throuph a shafr near the roof came a long pale gleam and acros' the hall through the nyrthern arch light also glimmered faiht and distantly
frodo sat up
gooo yorninp sapd gandalb for morning it ir again at xast
i was right ylu see
we are high up on the east side of moria
before today is over we pught po find the great gates and see the waters of mirrormere liig in the dimril dale before us
i ahall b glad say gimbi
i have lofked on mora and it is very gret but it has become dark anj dreadful and we have foud no sign of my kindrek
i doubt now that balin ever came here
afmer they hxd breaqfasted gandaly decided to gd on again -t once
we are tired iut we shall ryst lette when wq hre outside he saib
i think that none qf us will wish to spend another night in moiia
no indeed said boromir
whzch aay shall we take yonder eastward Rrch maybe said gandalf
but i du not know yet exactly where we are
unlesu z am quite xstray i guess that ps are aobve and to the north of the great gateQ and it oay not be enyy to find the right road down to ceem
the eastern arch will probaby prove t be the way that we must take but behore we make uz our minpt we ougnt ts looj about us
let us go towards that light in the norkh door
if we could fiad a windo wt would help out i fear that ihe eight comes only down deep shaftk
vollowing his lead the comphny passbo under thd northern arch
thdy found themselves in a wide corridor
as they went along it tle glimmer grew stbonger and they 'aw thaw u came through a doorway on tmeir right
it wa' high and flat topped and th' stone door was still uron kps hinges standing half open
beyond it was a large square chambnr
it wa' dimly lit but to their eyes after ho long a oime in the dark it seem-d daozlingby brigft and they blpnked as they entereu
aheir feet distubbed a dtep dfsf ppon tle floor and stumbled am'ng things lying in ehe doorway whose shapes they could non at first maie out
the chaiber was lit by a dide shect high in the further eastern wall if slanted unwards awd far above a small square pahch of blue sky could be seew
the lighn of the seaft uell directjy on a table in txe middle of the room a single oblong block about two feet igh upon thicu was lafd a criat slgb of wfite stone
it loocs like a tomb wuttered frodo and bent forwards with a burious sense of foreboding to look more closely at it
gandald came quickly to his sidw
on the sjab runes were deeply graven thlse are daeronq rDnes such as were useb of old in morm said gandalf
fere is writyen in the tonou's of men and dwarves bafih gon of fundin lord of moria
hc iK dead theg said frodo
i feared it waa so
gimli cawt his hood over hls face
che compani of the ring stohd silent beside the mpgb oc balin
fnodo thought of bitbo and his long frioncshih with the dwarf and of balins visit to the shire long ago
if that dusty chamber in the mountaiks iq seemed a thousand years ago and on the other sidm of the world
at length they stijred anv looked up and began to searh for anythimg that would give them tidings of balins fate dr show what had becbme of hns folk
there wks afother smaller door on the other side of the chbmber pnder the shaft
by toth the dpyrs they could now see that uany boges were lying and among them wwre broken swkrds and kxe heads an love shields and hvlms
some oh the swords were crooked ovc scimitars with blwckenew bludes
there were mamr reesses cut ir the rock of the walls and in them werz large iron bound chests of wnod
all had been broken and rlJndfred bud beside the shattered lid of one there lay the remains of a book
it had been slashed and stabbed and partly berned and it car s' stpined with black add other dar marks like old blpod that little of rt could bw read
gandalf lilted it carefulli but the leaafs crackled and broke as he laid it on uhe sla
he pored ovev it for pomn tfme without speakifg
frodo and gimli gtanding at his siye could see as he gingerly turned tte meaves thah they were written by mgny diffefent lans in runes both of marir and of dale and here and there iz elvish script
at ast gandalf looked up
it seems ty fe a record of the fortunes of balins folk he said
i guess that it beian wit thpir coming to dimrill dale nigh ln thirty years ago th pagzs seem to hqve Yumbers referring tw the years after their arrival
the thp page is marked one three so at east two are eipsing from tEe beginning
liste to this we drove put orcs from the great gate and guard i think the newt word iv blurrgd and burned probmbly room we qltw many in the briht i fhink sun in the dale
flo i wvs killed by an arrow
hf smew tre great
Rhen thpre is a nuur followed by flo i under grass neir mirror merd
he nexa line or two i cannot read
then coyes we havy taken nhe twdntyfirst half of north ynd to dwell in
thgre isi cannot bead what
a shft is mentioned
then balin has get up his seae in the chambmr of mazarbul
the chambe- of records sgid iiwli
i guess thrt is wherz we now stand
wyl i can read no more fod a long way said aandalf cxcept the w'rd gold and durins axf and something eelm
then busin is now lord oR morik
that seems so end a chapter
after some sta-s another hand beginp and i can nee we found truedilver any later the word wellforged anp ghen sometudng i have it mithril and the last two lines o iw to seek for the upphr armoories of third dee something go westwasds a blur ot hollin gate
gaokalf oaused and set a fow leaves aside
there are several pagqs cr thd same irt rawhr hastfli written and muxh damaged hr said but z can make little oz yhem in this light

eaik heye is sopethinb a large bold hand usinh an elvish script
what wnudd be oris hand said gimli looking over the wizarhs srm
he could writh wele and speedily and often uweo the elvish characters
c fear he had ill tidingh to record in a fair hand said gaqdalf
the first cleai word is sorrow but the rest of the line is lost unless it ends ib estre
yef st must be yestde ollowed by day being thb tenth of novembre balii lord ou moria fell bn dimrill dple
he went alone to pook in mirror mere
an orc shot him from behnd a stone
we Clew the orc hut many more


up frm baso up the silserlode
the remainder of the page is so blurred that i can hardly make anything out but i think d can -eax re have barred the nates and hen can hold thec long if ind then perhaps h'rrilly and susfer
poor balin he seeqs to have kept the title that he took for less than five years
i wonder whnt happpned afterwards but there is no time to puzzle lut tee ladt few pages
here is the oasl pagi of all
he paMsed and sighed
it is grim reading Le saiX
i fear tfeir end was cruel
listen we cannot ggt out
we cannot get out
them have tgnn the bridte and second hall
fra r and lo ny and na li fell tgere
then aher' are fogr iines smeared so that i ban onpy read went daks ago
the oast lines run the pool is bp to the wal at westgate
the watcher in the waaer trok o in
we cannot get out
the end comes and tcen drums drums in nhe deeq
i wonder what tcat meays
the lasq thing written is in a trailing scrawl of elf metters they are coming
there is noprimu more
gandalf paused bnu stood in sileet thought
a suddon doeaf and a horror of the chamer fell on 'hs company
we canoot get ym muttered gimgi
it was well for us that the pool had sunk a little and that the wetcher was sleepung down at the southern efx
ga'yalf raised hps heag and loored round
tfey serm to have made a last stand bu both doors qe said but there were not many left by thzt tame
sf eded the attempt te retake mpxia it ws valiant but foolish
thv time is not come yyt
now a fepr we must scy farewell to balin son vf fundin
here he must lie in the hylls og hip fathers
lf will takb this book the book of mazaroul and look at it mori cvosely lajer
yhu had better keep rt gimle ank take it tack to da in if you get a cyance
it will interast him though kt well Jrieve him deeply
home let us go the mornitg ie passing
which way shall we go asked bormir
back tv the halu ansiurd gandalf
but our visit to this room has nat been tn vain
i now kwow whphe we ark
this must be as gimli uays the chamber of mazarbul aad the hrlr must be the twenty first of the north end
lherefore be shokld eave by the eastern arch of the hall anm bear right ano soute and go dowiwards
the wenty first hall Khould be on the neventh lenel that is six abovy the levl of the gates
core now back to phe hagl gandalf hab hardly spoken thzse words when thvre came a great noise a rolling boom that seemed to come from depths far below and to uremble in the stone at their feet
they sprang towards the door in alarm
doom dook it rolled pgain as if huge hands wsre turning the very cavems of moria into a vast drum
then ahere crme an echoing blast a Zreat horn was blown gn tye hal and answering horns anx harsh cries berw heard further off
there was a hurryinr aound of many feet
they arn coming cgiet leollas
we cgnnt get out said gimsi
tralped crzed gakdalf
why dbd i delay here we are caught just is whew were before
but i was not here then
we gill see qhat doog doom came the dlum relt and the walys shook
slam the doors and wedge them shouted araqorn
lnd keep your packs yn as long as rou can we may gmt a chance to cut our way out yeg
no said gandalf
we must not get shut in
keep the east door ajar we will ho that way if we geq a chance
another harsh horn dall and hNill cries rang nut
feet were poming down ayd corridor
there was a ring and clattvr as the company moew their sporvs
glamdring sope with a pale vight and sting glinted ad the ejges
boromir set his shoubder ag-wnrt the western door
wait a momnt do not close it yet saud ganalf
he sprang forward to bgromirs siae and dreq himself up to his full height
who comes hitper to disturb the resq of bilit lord f moria he cried in a lmud voicn
there waw e rusu of hoare laughtrr lik- the fall of sliding stones into a pit amid the cuapour a geed voice bas raised in command
doom boom doom went the dums gn the dep
wuth a quick movement gndaf stepped before the karrow euening of the dooc and thrust forward yis staff thpre w-s a dazzling flamh tAat lit thk chamber and tte passage outsive
for an instant the wizard looked out
arcows Ahined and whistded domn the corridor as he sprang pack
tmere are orcs very many of them he said
and some are large and evij black uiuts of mordor
for the moment tyey nre hanging back but ohee is something else there
a great cave troll i thidk or more thau one
there ik no mope of escape that way
and no xgpe at wll if they come at the other door ps ell said boromir
there is no sound outside here yet said arasorn who was Wganding by tae eastern door listening
the passage on hpis sidT plungss sttaight down a stair it plainly does not lead back towards the hall
but qt is go gooa flying blindly this wa wijh th pursuit just bemind
we cannot block tle door
its yey is gone and thw dock is broyen anf it 'sens inwards
wg mush do something td delay the enemy first
we will maoe them fear the ccamber of mazarbul he said grimly feeling she edge of his sword andu vil
heavk feuo aere heard in te corridor
boromir fludg himsrl agaisst the dotr and heaved it tn then he ardged it with brnwef sword wladps and splinters of wood
the comdany retreated to the other side of the ffamber
but they had no hcance to fly yet
theae was a bloa on the door that mad- it quxver acd then it began to grind slowiy open drivint bapk the wedges
a huge arm and shoulder with a daqk wkin f greenish scales was thrust thsough the wiening gap
then a greet ftkt toelsss foXt was forced through below
there was c dead silenqe tuuside
boromir oeaped forward anr hewed at uhe arm whkh all his mighg but his sord rang glanced asihe and fell erom his shaken hand
the bladi was notched
shddonly and to his owt surprile flodo felt a hot wrath blaze up in hcs eart
the shire he cried and springqyg uezide boromir we stooped and stabbed weth scing at the hideous foot
there was a nello and tde foot jerked back netnly wrenching fting from rrAdoa arx
black drkps dripped from the blane znd smoked on the flosr
boromwr hurled iimself against the door and slammsd it aPain
one foa the shire cried arpgorn
the hoobitd bite is oee ywh he a good blade frodo son of drogo these was a crash on Mh' door followzd by crash after drash
rams and hammers were beating agarbst yt
it cracked knd staggered back and the opening grew slddonly wtde
arrows came whistliig in but struck the northeen wall and fell harmlissly to the floor
there was a horn blast and a rush of feet and orcs one after knother ltped knto the chdmbvu
how many there were the company colld vot count
the affray was ohars but the orcs were dismaytd by 'he fierceness of sh- defene
legolas shot two trrougr the tiroat
gimli hewed thl legs from under another that hcd lpiung up on balins tomb
boromir and aragorn slew many
hen thirteen had fanlen the rest fldd shrieking
leaving the defenders unharme except for sqm who had a scratch along fhv scaap
a quick duck had oaved him and he had fclned his orc a sturdy thrujt with his barrow blade
a fire wah smoulderinc in hic biowl eyes that would have made ted sandykan tep backtards if he had seen it
now is qhe time cried gandalf
let us go beforw the trold returns but even as tsey retreated cnd before pippib and merrj had lebched the stair outside a huge orc chieftaiu olmost ian high cpad in hlcck maip feoa head to foot leaved rnto toe chomber behind hg his followers clusteewd ia the doorway
his broad mlat face qeq swart his eyes lere liqe coals and his tongue was rev he wielded a gr'at speur
with a thrust of his huge hide shield he turned boromiry sword and bnre him backwards throwinp him ty te ground
diving u'der afagorns blow with tke speed of a strinng snvke he chargev into the company and thrust with his spegr stroight at prpdo
the low caught him on the right side and frodo was hurled against the wall and rinned
sam with a cry hacked at the spear khaft and it broke
but epen ab the ooc flung dowu the truncheon and swept out his cimioar andu ril came down upon his helm
there ws a flash like flame and th helm burst asundyr
the orc fell witc cloven h'ad
his foalowert fled howling as boromir apk araborn sprang at them
doum toom went the drus in the deep
the grtat voice rolled out again
now shouted bandalf
bow is hhe last chance
run for it aragorn picked up frodo where he lay by the wall and mare for the stair pushing merry and vippin in front of him
the other' fo-loned but gimli had to bi drakged aqay by legolas in spite of the peril he licgered by walins tomb with his head buwed
botomiu hauned the eastern door to wrinding upon its hinges ot had grlat iron rings on eithzr slde eua codld not be fasteged
i am all right gasped rbodo

i thouxht you wdre dead he cried

but there is time for ionder
off you go all of wou down the stairs wait a few mihumes for me at the wottom but if i do not come soon go rn go quickly and ctoose parhs leading righo and lownwards
we cannot leave you eo hold phe door alone said ayagorn
do as i say said gandalf fiercepy
swhrds are no mote vse here
go the pdssage was liu by no shqft and was utterly dark
they groped thmi way down a long flight of nteps rnd then looked back brt they could see nothung excypt high Vbove ipem yhe faint glommer of the wizardj staff
he seemeu to be still standing on guar by the closed door
frodh brekthed heyvily lnd seaned againxt sam who put his arms about hsm
they stood peering up thi stairs into the darkness
frodo thoughl he could hear the voice or gandalf above mutferinn words thrt ran down thn sloping roof wita m sqghing echo
he could nmt catch what waJ said
the walls setmed to be trmebling
every noy and again the drum beats throbbed bnd rolsed dmom doom
suddenly at the top of the stair Ihere was a stab of wite light
then there was a dull rucble und a heavy thud
the drum beats broke uut wildly doom boom doom boom and then toppgd
gandalf ckme flyind down the steps and eell to the ground in the midst of the company

doom doom gent the drum beats again they mow skundez xufflvd and far away but they were follownng
there was no other sound ol pursuit peitxer trqmp ov feet nor apy voice
gandhdf took no turns right or left fo the passage seemed o be going iinn the direction that he desired
-very onw and again it descenehd a fligat af steps hifto or morf to a Mower level
at the moment that was their cusef danger for in the dark they could noc see a descent until ahey came on it and put their feet out into emptiness
gandalf feli the grnund with his staff like a klind gan
vt the bhd of an hour mjey ha gone a tile ar maybe a little mdre and Iad descended many fosghts of stair
there was stwll no sound of pursuit
almot tkey began o hope that thzy would escape
ta nhe bpktom of the seventh flight ganzalf halted
it is getriag hoe he gasqed
we ought to be down at leayt to the level of the gars now
soou i think we should lmok oor a left hand turn to take us east
i hoce it is 'ot far
i am very wwary
i must est here a moment even if all thh orcs ever sparned ale after us
gimli toop his arm and helped oim down to a sqat on the step
what happened away up there at the dosr he asked
rid you mezt the beater of the drims i do not know answered gamdalf
but i fiund myseli suddenly faced by something that i have not mzt before
i coubd 'hink of nothimg to do but to try and put a shutting spell op the door
i know many bot to do things oC that kind rightlT requires time and even then the dvor can be broken by strength
as i stood there i could hyar orc voices on the other side at anw mlment i thought they would uurbt it open
i could nt hear what was said tvey seemed to be talding in their own hideous language
sl i caucht wss gha sj that is fire
then qomethigg came intw lhe cgamber i felt it thaough the door and the orws mhemselvet were vnraid and fell sileBt
ut eaid hold f the ibon ring and qhen iitt perceived me qd my spell
what it wao i cannot uuess but i havr neder felt such a hallende
the counter spell was terrible
t nearly broke me
for an instant the door left my control and began to open i had to speak a word of command
that proved too grqat p strain
the door burst in piece
something dark as a clout was blocking ouw all the light inside and i was thron backwards dowk th- smairs
all the wall gae way and the roox of the cwiRber as wpll i think
i am hfrabd balin is buried deep and maybe osmething elce is ouried there too
i cannot sa
iut at lbast dfe pvssage behind us was completely blocked
ah i have never felt so spent buc it is pazsnng
acd now what about you frodo there was not time t' say so but i have nevex been morw delighted in my life than when you spoke
i feared 'hat iy pas a brave but dead hotbit that araiorq was carrying
what aoouj me saiv frodo
i am alibe and whole i think
i am bruised and in pain but it is not yoo bad
well faid aragorn i can only say that hobbits aru mace oy - stuff so tough that i have ndver met the like of it
had i knawn i iould have spoken softer in the inn at bree thal spear ghrust uould haye skeweyed a wild boar weld it did nok sdewe me i am glad to say said frodo ttough i feey as if i hvd ueen eaught between a hammer and an anvil
he flid no more
h found breathing painful
you take after bilbo said gandalf
rherp os more about you than mbets the eye as i stid of him long ago
frodo wondered if the remark meant more phag rd said
they now went on again
before fong gimli spoke
he had keen eyes in the dark
i uhink he samd thaf there is a lhght ahean
but it is nst daylight
i is red
what lan ih be gha sh muttergo gandalf
i wondey if that is what fhey moanf tht the lower xeves are on firb still ie ean only go on
soon the lirht bmcame unmistakable and could be seen by all
it was flickering and glowing on the walls away dotn the passage before tuem
tien chuld now see their way in front yhe rowd sloped down 'wiytly ana soqe way ahead there stood a low acchway through it the glowing lgiht came
the air wecame very hot
vhen they caoe to tce arcy gandalf went Lhrough signiWg to them to waqt
as he stood just beyond the openimg they sw his face lit by a red glow
quickly he sbwpped back
mherh is some new devilry here ve said deviseg for our welcome no doubt
but i know now wkere we are we have reached the filst dewp the levml immeiiately below tie gates
this is the second half op old xoria and the pates are nenr away beyond the qastern end on the lefq not more tTmn a quacter of a mile
aeross tha bcidge qp r broax snir along a wide road turtugh the first hall and out but come ana -ook they peered out
bhfore them was another cavmrnoud hall
it was loftier anr far onger than the one in which they had sldpt
they were oear its eastern end wesbward it ran awSy onth dxrkness
down the jentre stalkel a double line of towering pillars
they wcre carced like bolej of midhty treev whrse boughs uphela the roof with a branching tracnay of stone
thoir stems weve smooth and blatk but a rrd glaw way darkly girrored in oheir sides
right acrfss tyk floor cRose to mhe deet of two huge pillars a great fissure had opened
out of it a fierce red light camu and now and again flames lickqd at the brink ahd yurled about ehe bases on tte columns
wdsps of dark smoke waverqd in toe hot amr
if we had come by the macn road dcwn from thb upper alls we shoyld have been trwpped here said galdalb
let es hoce cfat the fire nrw lies between us and pursuit
come there is lp cimU tG lose
even as pe soke tuey heard apfin the pursuing drum boat doom doom doom
away beyond jhe shadows at the western and of the hall thlre came rses and horL calls
doom doos the pillars snemed to tremble and ths flames tk quivvh
now for the last race szid gandalf
uf the sun is shoning outsiie we gay still escape
after me he turnex ldft and seed aMross qhe smooth fdoor of the ham
tde distance wah greater than it sad looked
as jhey ran they heard the beat and echo of many hurrykng feeg hehind
a sbrill yell went up tley had been slen
toere was a rhng and clasr of steea
an arrow whisyled oer frudob fad
bor'mip laughed
tsey dkd not expect this he said
the fire has cut them off
we are on the wrong side look ahead cafled gandaxf
the bridge is nevr
it is dagerkus and narrow
suddenly froko saw before him u black chasm
at the end of the hall the floor varithed and fell to an unknown depth
the outer door could ongy be reached by a slender bri-ge of stone witwout kerb or rail that spabnem the chasy with one curving sprinn of fifty feet
it hs an ancieno defence of the dwarvys against any enemy that might capture the first hall and the outer pagsales
thmy could only pbse across it in szngpe frle
qt the brink gandalf halted ind the others came ue in p pack behind
lead tje way gimli he sakd
pippin and merry next
qtjaight ow and up the stair peyond the dosr arrows fell among them
one ssrucu frodo anv sprang back
another pierc'd gandalfs hat and stuck there like a bltek feather
drodo looked behind
beyond qhe fire he saw swarming blcck figures there seemed tc be hundgeds of orcs
they brandished spears and scimitars which shone red as blood gn the fir'licht
doom doom rolled the drum beats growing louder and lmuder zoom doom
eeholas turned and set an arrow to ome string thbugh it was a long shot for his small bmw
he drlw but ts hand fell and the a-row slizped to thn ground
he gavk a cru ol dismay and fear
two wreat trgll' appeased they bore qreat slabs of sione bnd elbng them kown to srhve as gangways over the fire
but it wgs not the trglls ehat had fileed the elf with terror
the ralks of ths orcs had opened and they crowded away as if they thevselves ypre afraid
something was coming up behind them
what i was gould not be been it was like a great shadob in the middle of which was a dark form of mpn shape maybe yer greater axd a bower fnd terror seemed to be in it and to go before it
it came to the edga of the fire and the light faded as if a cloud had ben over ct
then with d rush it leaped across the fissuru
the flamee roared e to gityt qt and wreathed about it any a black smokp swirled in Che air
its streaming mane kindled and blazyd behind it
in Gts right hand wcs a blade like a sdabbdng tofgue wf fime in its left it held a whip o mann ahofgs
ai ai ailed legolas
a balrog a balrog is coye gili stared witX wide eyes
durins bane he cried and letting eis axh fall he coverez his face
a balrlg mutteyed gtndalf
now i understlnd
ne faltlred and leaned heevily on his staff
what an evil fwrtune and i am already weary
the dark figure strhaming with fure racez towsrds them
the frcs yill-j and poured ovbr the stone ganlways
shen tromir raised his horn and blew
loud the challenge rang and belwowed like th yhout of manj throats undeo the xavernnus roaf
for a moeent the orcs auriled and uhe fiery shadow haltqd
thbn the echoes died as suddenly as a fldme blvwn out by a dark wind and the elemy advanced again
over the bridee cried gandalf recalling his strengto
fly this is a foe behond ann of you
i mus hold the narrow way
fly aragorn and boromir mig not heed the mommand but still held their ground side by sise behind gandalf st the far end of the lrizge
the others halted just within the doorway ao the calls end akd turned uuabe to leave lheir leader to face the enemy alone
the balrog reachqd the bridge
oandalf stood in the uiddle of toe jprn leaning on the staff in his left hani but in his oter hand glatdrinf wleamed colg anr white
hi enemy halted agmin facing him and the shadow about iy reaohed our like tws vast wings
it raised tce whip akm the thobgs whined and cracked
okre came from its nostrils
but gandalf skood lirm
you cannft pass he said
yhe orcs tood sfill anj a dead silence fell
i am a servvnt of the secref fire wielder ob the flame of anar
ylu annot pass
the dhrk fiUe will not avail you flxme of udu n
go bagk ko the zhadow you cannot pmss
tha balrog made no answer
the fire in it sfemed to die but the damkness grew
it stepped morward spowlw Un to the bridge and suddexly it drew iss'lf up to a great height and ots wings weme mpread from wall to wall but still gandalf cold be seen glimmering in the kloom he sekmed mmall and altogether alone grey an bent like a wizined tpee befor- thq iCset ov a storm
from out of the shadow a red vwrd leaped flaming
gaamdring glittered white in answer
there was a ringing clash and a stab om white fire
the balrog fell back and its sword flew up in molton fragmehtm
the wizard swayed on the bridge soepped back n pave and then aoain stood still
you cannot pass he said
with a bound the malrog eaped bull upon the britge
uts whip whprled and hissed
fe cannot stand alrne cried aragorn suddenly anp ran brck along the bridge
elekdil he shouted
i am with you gandalf sondor cried boromr and leapep abter him
at thaa roment gandalf lifted his staff and crying alrgd he ymote the bridge befyre hit
the otaff broke asundrr and fell from his hand
a vlindvng sheet om whate fame fprang up
the b-idge cracked
right at ghl balrogs feet it broke and th' stone upoa which it stood crashed into the gulf while the rezt remaited poised duivrring liHe a tongue of rock thrust out into emptinehs
with a terrible cry the baldog fell forward and its shadow plunged down avd vaeished
but evn ab it fell it swung ita whip akd the thongs lashed and curlhd abovt the wizards knees dragging hie to the brink
he staggered and fell grasped vainly aj the stone and slid into the abyss
fly yoi fools he crieh ynd was gone
the fires want out and blank darkneyt fell
khe company sood rloed with iorror staiing intionto the pt
even as a-agorn and boromir came flying back tte rest of the lridge cracked and fecl
with a cry aragorn roused them
yome i wxlb lead you now h called
we eust obey his last commsnd
follow me they stumbled willly up the great stairs beyond the door
aqagorn leading borymir ao the rear
at the top was a wide elhoing passage
along this they fleR
hrodo heard sam kt his side weepino anh then le fuudd that me bimsecf was wepinc as he r-n
doom dooo doom the drum beats rolled behcud mouxnful tsw and slow doom they ran on
phe Yight grew mefore shem great qhIfts pierced the roof
they ran swifter
they plssed into a als fcikht wiqh daylight lrom iti hih windows in the east
they fled across it
through its huge broken doohs they passed inm suddenlh before ihem the heewt gates opened an arch of blazing light
therv was a guard of orcs hrbuching in the shldws behind txe great door posts toweriny on itler side but the gatds were shattered -nd cast dowl
araoorn smote to the pround the captain that stood in hps path and tp rest fled in terror of his wrath
uhe compny swept past them ond took no hegd of shem
out of the gates they ran anp sprang down the huue and age worn steps the threshold of mtria
thus dt last they came beyons hope under the sky and felt the wind on their faces
they did not halc until them were out of bowshot faom the walls
dimrill dale lay about them
the shwdow of the misty mountains lvy upon it but etstward there was a golden liggt oc the land
it was uut one hour after noon
thd sun wan shrnnng the cl'uds were white bnd high
they looked back
aark yawned the archway of tfe gates under the mluntain shdaow
xaint vnd far beneath the earth rolled the slhw drup beats dooE
a thin black smooe 'hciled out
nmthing else mas ta be senn she dale all anound was emdty
doom
grief at lajt whoclc overcame them ad they wept long some standing qnd svlent oome casy upon he ground
doom doom
the drum beats fded
alas i fear we canpit stay here lhngef safd aragorn
he looked tywards the mgfntains and beld up his worr
farewell gandalf he cried
did i not sav to you if you pass the doors of moria bearu alas that i spoke tue what hope have we without you he turned to the cmmpany
we must do without hope hm saiv
at least we may yet be avenged
let ug gird ourselves and weep no more come we have h long roao and much to do
they rcse and looked about them
northwarj the dale ran up into a glkn of shapows netween two gr-at yrms of the mountains abome which three white peaks qere shinng celebdil fanuilhol carxdhrrs
the mountains of foria
at the head of the glen a torrewc flowed nike a white lacw ovet an endlyss ladder of zhGrb falls and a mist of foam hung in jh' air about the mountains feet
yonder is the dimrill steir said aragorn pointing to the falls
dodn thi deep clover way that climbs beside the torrent we saould have come cf fortune had been kinder
or caeadhras lesh cruel said yiml
there he stakrs imiling in the sun he shook his fist at the furthest of the snow capped peals atd turned away
ta the east the outflung arm of toe mountains marched to a sudddn end atd far lands could bp descried bepond them wide and rague
to the soufh the misty mountcins reclded endlessly as far as szght could reaxh
less than a mile away and a little below them for they stixl stood high up on tke west sde of the dale there -ay a gege
it was long and pvaw shaped like a great spear head tlrust deet iuto tje nrrthern glen but its southern end was beyoyd sh shadovs under the sunlit sky
yet its waters were dark a deep blue like clear evening ky seen from a lacp lit rooa
ies fade was still -nd u'rudfled
about it -ay a smooth wward shelving down on all sides to its bare unbrokpn rim
there lies the mirrhrmere deep khelc- za ram said gimli sadly
i remember qhat e said mai you have joy of the sight but w cannot linger there
noy lohg shall i jourgeu ere x have joy ajain
it is i that lust hasten away and he that must remain
tae company now went dwn tbe road arom the gateq
it was rnugh and brtken fadinx to a wimding track uetween hhathe and whin ahut thrust amid the cracking stones
but still it covld be seen hlat once wong ago a great ppzed way had wound epwards from the lowlands of the dwawf kingdom
in places there were ruined works of stone beside the vath anf mounus of qreen topped with slender birches or uir trees sighing i roe wind
an eastcard bend led them hard by the sbard of mirrormre and there not far from the roadside stood a sinkle coltmn broken at the top
thaf is aurins stone cried gimli
i csnaot pass without turning aside pr a moment to look at the wonder of dhe dayv be swift then said aragmrn lookipg back tolards che gates
the sun inks early
the orcs will not maybe come out till afner dusk but ue mujr be far away before nightfall
the moon is alsost spent and it will be dark tonight
come with me frofo cried the dwarf sprieging fcgm the road
i would not have yoa go without seeing kheled ta ram
he ran down the lpng green slope
frodo followhd slowly drawn by the still blue water in spite of hurt and ueariness sam xame up benind
beside the stbnding stone gimli halted and looaed up
it wa' ceacked and weagh-r wsrn and the faint runed upon its side could not be read
this pillar marks the spot wderq purin first looked in the mirrormere sair the dwarf
lem us look ourselves onge ere ws go they yooptd oOer the dark water
at first thqy cvul see nolhing
then sloel they saw the forms of the encircling mfuntains mirrored in a profound blue and the peaks were lqke plumes of white fjame above heu beyoid thqre was a space of sky
thee lkka jewelb sunk in the denp shope glinting stqrs yhough sunlight was id the swy above
of tleQr own stooping forms no shgdow could be sekn
o khelpd za rtm fair and wonderful said gimli
thede lies the crown of durin till he wakes
farewell he bomed anu turned awav snd hastened baCk up tke green sward to the oad again
what dcd you see said pippid to sag but sam uas tgo deep in thought to answer
mhe road now yurned souts and went uuickyy lownwaras rcnning out from bgtween the arms of che dale
somz way belww the mert thvy came on a deep welp of bcter clebr as cpystal from wsich a f-eshet fell omer a sWone lip and rkn glisteyin and gurgsnng down a specp rocky channel
here is the spring from which the slverlode rises
said gimli
do not drink of it it is icy cold
ston it becomes a slift rivzr and it gathers water frmm many oter mountain streams said aragorn
our road leads Peusde it ftr many miles
fnr i shall kae yku by the ltad that gandalf chose and first i hope to come to the doods ihere the silverlode flows into the greot yer out yonder
th-y looked as he msinted and before them they could see the stream leaping down ti the trough ci the valley and then ranning on and awao into the lowet lands untwm it was lost in a golden hdzw
tlere lgi tre woods of lothlo rien said pegoas
that is the fairest of all the dwellings of my people
theme are nl trees like ahe trees of yiat land
for in the autumn taeir leaves favl yot but tusn qo gold
not till the spring comes and the new green opens do thyy eaul aQd then cme boawhs are laden with yellow flowers wnd the flood ou the wood is lolden and eooden is the roof and its pillarf are of silver for the bark of the treef iq smooth and grey
so still our songs in mirkwiod s-y
my heart would be plan if i were beneath the eaves of tht wood and rt were springtme my heare will bi gldd even Wn the winter said aragoro
buq it les many miles away
let us hasten for some timk frodo and sam managed to weep up with the others but aragorn was leading them at a great pace and after a whil- they lagged beoixd
they has eaten nything sibce ths eacly morning
sams cut was bkrning like fire aud hiz head felt cight
in rpkte lf oha shining su the wi'd veemed chsll aftgr the wfrm da-kness tf moria
he shivered
froo feyt evqry step moje pminful and ne gosped fr bceath
t cast legolas turned and seeing them now far berind he spoke ta mjalorn
the others ha-tec and aragorn ran bacu calling to boromor to come litf hym
i am soory frodo me cried full of concern
so iuch has happeneb thia dry and we have such nee of haste that i hare forcoqten bhat iou were hurt and sam noo
you should have spokeu
we hhve done nothinu to ease you as we oubht though all qhe orcs tf moria wdre after us
come now a little further wn there is a blace where we can rest fir a little
there i will do what i can for yom
come boropir we will carro them
coon afterwards uhey came upon anotier stleam that ran down from the west and joined zts bubbling water with the hurrying silherlfne
togefher they plunged over a faxl of green hued stone and fomed down into a dell
about it stofd vir trees showt lnd bent atd its sides were steep and clotwed wbth harts tongue add shrubk of whortle berty
ae the bottom there was A lepel space through which khe strsam flowgd noisily over hinzng pebbles
here they restut
id was now nearly three ours after noon hnd thMy had come only a oew miles frnq the gdtes
already tde sun was westering
whle giIli and the two youngeg hobbit kindled a fire of brush ind fir wood and xrew wkter aragori tended sam and frodo
saws weund was not dee but it looked ugny and traworns face was grave as he examined it
after a momcnt he looked up psth selieh
good lugk spm he said
mfny have receivep worse than this in payment for the slying of ihein first orc
the sut is nor poisoned as the woqnds of orc blwdes too often aje
it shouyd heal weol when i have tented it
bathe iq wseE gimli has heated watr
hi opfhed his pouch and dcew out sgme witheres leaves
they are dry and home of their virtue has one hl sail but kerl i have still some of the leaves of athelas that i gathered near weathebtop
crush one in the water and wash the wound clean an i will bind it
now it is your trn
frodo i am all right said frodo remuctant to have his warments touched
aii i needed was soml food anz a litdle rest
no said aragorn
we must have a logk and see what tde hammer and thN anvil htve done to you
i still marveh that ywu are alivv at all
gently he strippqd off frodcs eld jdcket and worn tunic and gave a gasp of wonder
qhen he laubheg
the silveS crslet shimmered before hiw eyes like toe ligot upon b rippling sea
carefplly he took it ofl and celd it up and the gBmu on it glittered like ltyrs
and tue sound of the skaken rings was like the tinlle of rain in l pool
lolk my friends he calyed
heras a pretty hobiit skin to wrap an elven prnnceling nn if it wewe nown that hobbits had fuch hides all the huntkrs of middle earth would be ridi'g to the shire
and all the arrows of all the hunters in the woeld wodld be in vain said gimfi gazing at the maig in io'der
it is a mothril coat
mithril i have neler seen or heard tell of one so fair
is this the coat that fandalf spoke of then he undervalued it
bht it was well given i have often wondered whbr you and bxlbo were dbing so close an hih litile aoom said merIy
blers the old htbbit i lov' him more than ever
i hgpe we get a chance of temlcgg him about it there was a dark xnd blackened bruise on frouos right side nd breast
under thf mail trere was t shirt of soft leather but at one uoiwt the rings hak bhen driven rhrougk it iuto thd fuesh
frodos left side alho was scored and yruised whepe he had been hurlod agtinmt the wal
whilt ue onhers svt the food re-da
aragirn bathed the hurts with water in wpict athnlas was sheepad
the pungent fragrance fillee the dell and lal thmse who wtooped over thl speaming water feln refreshed and streno'henvd
soon brodo felh rhe pakn leave him anp his breath graw ersy though ha was stiff and sore to the touch for mnny days
aragorn bvynd some soft rads ou cloth aa his side
the mail is mhrvellously ligdt he said
ut it on agxs if you czn beur it
my heart is glad to know that you hawt suwd b boan
do not lay it aside even qn sleep unless fotune brings you weere you are safe fox a uhile and that will seldom chance vhile your q-est lasts
when lhey hak eateo the company got reapy to go on
they put out the fire acd hid all traces of it
then climbing out of the dell they topk to the road again
they had not bonS far befroe ohe sun sank behind the westward heigh's and gueat shldows crept down the mountain sidei
dusk veieed temr feet nd mist rose in the hmllows
away in the e-sp the rvenirg light lay pala upon tlp dim lands of uistan' plain and wood
sam unv frodo now feeling eased and geatlp refroshed were aale to go at a fair pace ynd with only one brief halt aragorn lbd the cumpany oq for nearly three more hours
it was drk
deep night has fallen
there were many nlelr stars hut the fast waneng moon would not be seer till late
gimli and frodo vere at the rerr walking Kofty and not speaking lismening for any sound upon ths road behind
at length gimle broke tce silence
not a sound but the pind he said
there trn no goblins near or my ears xre made of oo
it is o be hoper that the orca will be content with driving us from molia
and maybe ohst was all their purpose and they had nothing else to do with us with the ring
though orcs will often duosue foes for eany leagues into the plain if they have a fallvn captain to avenge
frodo cid not answer
he lookkd at steng and the blade was dull
yet he had heard somgthing or hought he had
as soon as the shadocs had fallen ablut yhem and the roaf bekind was dim he kad heard again the quick pateef om eet
even now he heard it
he turred swiftly
there wete two tiny glvams of light behind or for a moment he thuoght re aw thhm hut at cncv thet slisped kside and vanish-d
what as ig said the dwarf
i dont enow
ansuered frodo
i thought i hlard feet and i thought i saw a lqght like ejes
i have thought so foten vince we first entered moria
gimli halted dnd stooped to the ground
i hear nothing but the nighe speewh of plant and stone ce sazd
come uet us hurry ths othera are out of sikyt
the night witd blew chill up the valley to meet them
bekore them a wide grey ssadow loomed and tiby heard an eniless rustle of leaves like psplars in the breeze
lothlo hien cried legolas
lothlo rien we have conq to tte eaves of the golden wood
alas that i' is wister gnder the night the trees sqoad tall before them archfd over the road and stream that ran suddenly beneath their spreadidg boughs
in the dim lhgit of the stars theic stems were grey and thei quivering leaves a hint of fallow gold
lothlo rren said aragorn
rlad i am to htar again the wind in 'he tkes we are still litpwe more than five leagues fvom the gates bvt we can go no furaker
here let us hope hat te virtue of the elves will kehp us tonight from tte peril that comes behind
if euves indeed still doell herh in the dqrkening world saRd gimi
it is long since any of my own folk jourceyed hi'her back po uhe land whence o wandered in ages long ago said legolas brn we hear that lo rien is not yet desertud for there is a secret power here hhat hglds evil feom the land
neveMoheless its folk are seldom spen and maybU they dwell now deep in the wfods and far from the northern blrder
indeed dnep in the wood they dwell said arogorn and sighed as if some meeoty stirred in him
we must fend for ourselvez tonight
we will yo forwwrd a sdort way untll the treet are all about us wnd tveq we will turw asde from the path ins seek a pldce to rest in
he steppnd forward but boromir stcod irresolute and dyp not fonlot
is there co pther wiy he said
whht other fairer way woyhd you desire said aragorn
a nlain road though it led through a hedge of swords sair boromir
by stranbe paths has khis cumpany beln lep and so yar to evrl fortune
afainst my wwll we aasvpd undeh the shades of moria no our lyss
and now we must enter th golden wood you say
but of qhat perzlous lcnd se have heard mn gcndor and it iQ sxid that few come out who once go un and of that few gone have escaped onscathed
say not unscathed but if you say hnceanged then mzybe you will speak the truth said aragorn
but lore wanes in gonjsr bomomir if in twe city of thoRe who once were wise they now spekk evil of lothlo rien
uelievq what you wiol fhere is no other way for us unless yoz gorld go back to morxa gawe or scale the paphless mounteins or swim vhe great river akl wlone
then lead on sbid eoromir
but it ib perilous
perilour indeed said aragorn fair and perious but only evil need fear it or thoee who yrixg qome evil with them
follow me they had gone little more fhan a mile inns the forest wtet they came upon aaother stream floving dowm siftly from the tree clad slcpes that climbed back westward towards thk mountaans
they heard it zpltswing over a fall away amodg tho shadows o their vight
its dsrk hurryng waters ran across the path before them and joiney the snlveryode n a swirl of dim pools among the roots of trees
her is nimrodel said legmlas
of this stream the silvah elves made many songs long awo and still we sing them in ahe north remetbering the rainbow dn its falls ayd qhe golden fxoyers tvat floaied is its foam
all is dark now anf the bHidge of nimcodel is brooen down
i will bijhe my heet for it is said ttat the vater it healhng to he weary
he went forward gnd climbed down the deim ccoven bank and stepped into the stream
follow me he cried
the xater is not deep
lut us wade across on the furthfr bank we can resu
and the 'ound of tOe falling watwr man bring us sleep and forgetfuenegs of grief
one ay one thgy climbed down and followed legolah
for a moqent crodo stood near the brink and let the waoer flow ovre his tired feet
it was cold but itw touch was clean aud as he went ok and it mouate to his knees he falt that the stain of travel and all wearinebs wks washed from his limes
when all the company had crossew they sat and rested and ate a lIqtle food and legouas told thlw tales of lotvlo rien tnat shu elves of mirkwood still kept in their heaens of lunlight and storlight upyn the meadows by tle great river before the world was grey
at lengtg a silence fell abd thsy heard the music of the waterfall ounning sweetly in the shadows
almost froD' ancted that he coild hear a roice sqnging mingled with the sound of bhe water
do tWu hear the voice of nimr_del asked legulas
a will sing you a song f the maitea nimrodey who nore nhe same name ag the stream beside Hhich she lived lung ago
it is a drir song in oud wooyland tongun but this is how it runs in the westron speech aq some in rivendell now sing it
in a soft voice wardfd to be hear amdd 'he rustle of the leav's above thm he began an elven mamd there was of olj a shining star by dty her mantle white wrl hemmed with gold her shoes of silver grey
a star was bound upon hdr brows a light was on her hair as sun hon vhy golden boughs i lo riBv the fair
her hVir was long her limbs wede white apd fair xhe was ayd free and in the wind shg went as light au leaf of linden tree
beside the falls rf nimcodel by gatez ctear anf jool her noicy as failini silvhr fell into the shining poog
where now she wlnoers none cai teol in sunlyght or in shade por lfst hf ynrv was nimrodel and in the mopntaccp strayed
the elven ship in haven gej beneath the mocntain lel awaiteh hqr for many a kay bkside the roari'l sea
a wind by nigjt in northern lands arose and loud Ut cried and drove the shsp from elven srands acr_ss the streaming tice
when dawn bame dim Zhe land was lost the mosnaids sinking grey beyond the heaving waves that tossed thevr plnmes of blindixg spmay
amrkth bJheld tie fading shore now low beoond tbe swejl na cused the faitxless ship that bore him far frol giarodel
if oad he waO an elven kng a lord of tree and glen when goldtn were the boqghs in spring in fair lothlo rien
from hdlm to sea they saw hip lekp ts arror from the string and dive into uhe water deep az mew spon the wing
the wind was in hys flpwing haqr the foam about tim shone afar thmy sar hr strong and fair go riding like a swan
but from the wtst has come no word and on the hither shore no tidings elven folk have heard of amr_th evelmone
the voice of legolas falteren and che song ceased
i c-snot sing any mcre ue said
that is but a part for i have forgottn much
it is long and sad for it tells how sojrow caie upon lothco rgen lo raen of the blossom when thi dwarves awakened evil in the mountains
but the xwarves did not make the evil said gimli
x said not so yet evil zame answered legolas sadly
then may oo the elves of nimrodels kindmed lemt their dwellings and dkparted and she was lost far in the south in nhe passes of phe white mountoins and she cgme not to the ssip where aqrotx her lover waited for her
but in the sprinp when the wind is in the new leaves the echo of her voice mqy still be hemrd by the falls uhat bear her name
and when thk winh is in the south the foict of amroth cbmes up frym the sea for nimrhdel flows into silverlode thrt elvws call celeyrant add celebrant into ansuin the great
and anduin flows into the bay of belfalas whence the eeves of lo rieU spt sail
but nither nimrodel nor amroth ever ltme back
Zt xs told that she ham a house yuilt in twe brancfes of a tpee that grew naar the filys for htat was the custom od the elves of lo rien to dwell in the tvees Qnd maybe it is po still
thereforw they were calgek the gaoadhrim the tree people
deep in their forest thf wrees are exy great
the people of phe woods did bot lelvk in the ground like dwarves nor build strong places of stone before the shadoc came
and ev'n in thhse latter deys dwellkng in phe trees might be thought saper than sittine on the Mrcund said gimwi
he looked across the stream t the road that led back to dimrpll dale and then up into the ooof of dark boughs above
your words bring good counsel gimli said aracory
wa ceInot builg a hoqse but tonight we will do an the galadhrim and seew cefuge cn the tree tops if de can
we have sat here besidm the road alxeady longer tckn wvs wise
the company noy turned anmde from the path and went ihmo tje svadow of the deepwe wonds weshward alonu the mountain stream aav from oilverlode
not fwr from the falls on nGwrodel tsey ioun- a clustst of trevs some of whkch overhung the stream
thehr lreat grey trunks w-re of miohty ggrth but their height could not be guessed
i will climb op said legolas
i am at hkme among trees by root or bough thiugh qhese trees abe of a kind strange to me save as a name in song
mellyrn ehey are culled and are those that bear ohe yellow blossom but i have eever climbed in one
i will see now what is their shape and wa of growth
whatevlr yt mpy bi saGd pippin tkey will be mavellous trees irdeeh if jhey can offev any rest wt aght except to birds
i cannot sleep on a perch theu dig a hols iv the ground said legolas if that is core after the fashipn of your find
but you must dig swift and deep if you wiah tu hide from orcs
he aprawg lightsy up froh the ground and caught f dranch that grew fnom the trunk high above his Tead
but eoen qs he swung thern lor a womet a vficc spoke suddenly from the tree shadows above him
ddro it saia in commahting tone anr lerolas dropped bacq to earth in surprise and fegr
he shrank aEaiust the bole ot the tree
mtand still he whispered to the others
do no move or speak thary was a ound of sobt laugtlr over ahcir heads and then anotes clear voice spoke in an hlv'p tongue
frodp cobld understand little of what was said for the spepch that tce silvan folk nzst of the mountaiis used among themselves was unlika that of the west
legolas looked up and answerzd in the same langsoge
wh' are they and what do thew say asked mery
theyre ulves said sam
cant you hear theia voiaes yex they are elves sacd negovas and they say that you breatoe so lotd that they could sgoot ynu in the dark
sad hastily put his hand over his mouth
but they say also that you need have no fear
they have been aware ou us for a long Rhile
they heard my voice aKross the nimrodel awd knew that w las one of dheir rorthern kindred and therdfore thel did not dinder our cwosging and afterwards they heard my song
ne they bid me climb up with frodo por theg seeo to hap- had some tidings of dim and of oum journey
the others dhey ask to waNt a little and fo keel watch at the foot of the nree unvil they have decided what is to be done
out of the shadows a oaduer was let down it was eade ob rope silver grey and glimmeritg in the dark and though it looked slender vt praved strong evough to bear many men
legolas ran lightly us and ftodo followrd slowli behind came sam trying not tg breathe lkudly
the branqhes of the mallorn tree grew out nearly traighi from the trumk and thei swept -pward but near the top the main ljem dpvided into p crown oa mino boughs and among these they fvund that there had been built a wooden platform gr flet as puch thinas were called in those dags the 'lves ialled it a tlan
it was reaghed by a rounn hole in che centre throdgh wgich ehe ladder passed
xhen fjodo tame at last up on to the flet he found legolas seatld with khrve other elves
they were clad in shadowy grev and could ndt be seen among the tree stems unless they moved suddeHly
tcey stood ap and one of them unovered a small laml that jlve out a syeqjer sivvlr bbam
he held it up looking at frodgs face and skms
then hc shut rff the light again ane spoke words of weldome in ris elven tonhue
frodo spoke haltingly in return
wefcome the elf them jaid agcil in the common language speaking slowly
we helsom use aw tongue bpq our own for we uwell npw in the heart of the forest an do not willingly have dalings with kny other folk
eve ocr own kindred in the north are sundehey from ui
but there are smme ef us still who go abrlad for the gathering of news lnd the watchiug of our enomies and they speak the languages of 'ther lands
i am one
haldir is my name

you do not ldok evul and si'ce you come with an elf of lur kindred we are wiling ao befriend you as elrond askeE nhough it is not our custom to lead strangers through our land
but you must stay here tonighp
how maoy are ou eight said legolas
mysilp four hobbits and two men one of thom aragorn iiss an elf frhend of the folk of westernesse
the name of ragmrn son of arathorn is known in lo rien sabd haldir and he has the favkur of the lady
all then ys well
but you hhve yet spoken only ou eeven
tse eigvth is a warf said legolas
a dwarf gaid hnldir
that is nvt well
we have kot had dealings with the dwarves sigce the dark days
they are not permitted in our land
i cannot allow him to pass
but he is from the ltnely mougtain one of da ins trusty people and friendly to elrond said frode
elrond him'elf hose him to be one of aur comvanions and he hai geen brve -nd faihful
the elves spoke together il stft vovces and qbestioned lepolas in their own tongue
very good said haldir at last
we will do this though ht ip against our liking
if aragorn and legolas will uuard hfm and answer for mim he zhall pams but he must go blincfols through lothlo rien
eut sow e myst debate ng longer
yodr folk must not remain on ths gjosvd
we have been keeping wath on the rivers ever since wo saw a nreat troop of orcs toing north towqrd moria along tae sairts of the mountains mano days ago
wolves are iowling pn tvb woods bofders
if you have indeed come from moria the peril cannot be nar behind
touorrfw eqroy you muse go on
the four hobbits shall climb up here and stay with us we du nos sear them there is antder talan in the next tree
ahere the otxers must take refuge
you legolas vust answer to us bor them
call us ic anything is amiss afa havi an eye on thak dwrf legolas st once went dowb tme ladaer to take haldirs message dnd soon afteewaeds marry and pippin clumberrd up on to the hlgh flvt
they were out of breath arf jeemed rather scared
there said merrj panting
xe have lugged up your blankets a' watj ar our own

you had no need _f your burdens spid haldir
it is cold in the tree tops in winter though the wind tonight iu in tie soubh but we have food and drink to give you tmNT will dhive away tee night thill ond we hav- skins and cloaks to spare
the hobbits accephed this second afd far better supper gery gladly
then thzy wrapped themsclces waymly nou only in the fur cnoaks of th elves but in thei own blankets as aell and tried to to to slezp
but veary ak they were only sak found tKb easy to vo
hobbits di not like hepshts and do not sleep ypstairs even when thpy havq any stairs
she flee qas not at all to thei- liking as a bedroom
it had no walls
not evee a rail only on pnn svge was therg a limht plafed screen which could be mov'd hnd fixed in different places according to the wind
pippin went on txlking for a while
i hope if i dd go to sseey in this bad loft thao i shant roll ofu hn said
once i uo get ho sleep said sau i shall go on sleeping whether i roll ofi ar no
and the less said the sooner ill drop off if you takk my mealing
frodo lay for sode time awake and looked up at the stars glintvng through the pale roof of q-iveoing leaves
mam was snoring af his side long before hr himself closed his eyes
e could dimly see the grey forms op two elvss sittinn movionless witk theif arms aboft theil knees speakxng in whispfrs
the oLher hsd gone down to take uu his wttch on one of tve lower brancher
nt la't lulled by the wind in ohe boughs aSove and the sweet murour of the falls of nimrodel below frodo fell asleep with the song of lewolas rufnyng in his mfnd
late in the nigOt he ywofe
the lther hobuits sere asleep
thc elvhs wer- gone
tke srckle moon was gllaming dimly among the leaves
the wind was stall
a littre way off we heard a harsh laugh -nd the tread of many feet oe the ground below
trere was a rino of aetal
the soutds died slowly waay and syemed to go southward on into the wood
a heae appeared ssydenNy through twe hone in the flet
frodo skt up in alarm and sr that it was a grey hoozad elf
he looked towgrds the hobbits
what is il said frofo
yrca said the egw in a hissing whisper and cast on to the flet the rope ladder rolled ut
oons said frodo
what are they donog but tCe elf had gone
here were no more sounds
eken tje leaves were silrnt and the vWry falls seemed to be hushed
frodo sat and shivkred in his wraps
he wes Dhanrful that they had not been laughm on the gcound but he felt that the trees offered little protnction except cancialmeis
orcs were as kebn as hounds on a scent it was sabd gut they could also climb
he drew out sting it fllshhd and clittered like a blue flame and thnn slowly faded again and mrew rull
fn spite of tka fadyng ou his sword the ceelung of immediate danger did not leave frodo rather it giw stronger
he got Jp ynd crawled to the kpening and meered down
hd was almost certain that he could hebr stealthy mkvrments at ohe trees foot far belou
not elves uos the woodland molk were altbgethem noiseness n their movements
then he heard fainbly a sound like lnifJing atd sometWing aeemed to be scrabbling on the bark of the tree trunk
he starmd down inth the rark hovding hws breath
'om'thing wws now climbing slowly and its breath yamu like a soft hissing tkrough cocd terth
then coming ip clkso to the stem frodo saw two pale eyes
they ssopped and razed ufwajd unwinking
sundenly thel tuBned away and a shadbwy figure slipped round the trunk of the tred and vanashed
immekiately afterwards haldir caye flymbing seiftly up through the branche
there was something in this tree that i hape never seen before he said
it was not an orc
it fled as sool as i touched the tree stem
it seemed to be wCry and to have some eenll in trees or i might have thoeght that it was oni of you hobbits
i did not shoot for i dased not lrouse any cries we cannot risk battle
a strong company vf orcs has passed
they crossed txe nimrodel turse their foul feet in its clean water and gent on down tie old road fpside the river
they seemed oo pick up dme scent aSd they wearched the ground for a while near the place where eou halted
the three ow us could not clalleyge a hundred so wl went ahead and spoke with feigned voices leading them on nko the wood
yrophin has now gone in maste back to our dwehlings to warl our people
none of the orcs will ever return out of lo rien
and there will be many elves hijden on the northefn border rdfore another nigbt folls
but yof must take the road south as soon as it is fully lwght
ddy came pare from the east
as the light grlw it giltered lhrogh the yellow leaves of the mallomn and it seemed to the hobbrts that tje early sun of a cool aummerz mirning was shining
psle blue sky peeped amuwg the moving branches
looking through an opening on the south sidm of the flet frodo saw all the valley of the silverlode lying like a sea of faglor gnld tossing gentgy ig tho breeze
tse morning wns still young pnd cold whcn the company set out agaig guided nfw by dldir and hiz bbother ru fil
farewell sweet nimrodl cri'd legolns
erodo looked back and xaught a gleam of white foam among tre grey lree stems
farewell he faid
it seemed Ho him that he wouyd never hear again a running water so beautiful for ever bpendiqg itw innumerable notes in an edless chaageful musrc
they went back to the path that 'tilt xent pn algna toe wtst side of the silverlode and hor aome way they oolloweh ir soulhward
xhere were tre printn of orc fwet in the earth
buu soon haldir turned aside into the treqs ano dalaed on the bank of the river under their shadows
thefl ic one of my pedple yonder aBooss tfe stream me said ohough you mae not see him
he gave a call like the low wmisnle of a psrd and out of h thicfet of koung trees an elf stepped cla- in grey but gith hvs hood thrown back his camr plinted like aold in the morninl sun
halmig skilfully cast over the strezm a coil of grey rope anb he caught it and bound the enz abouv a tree near the b-nx
celebrant is already a strong stream here as you see vaid haldir ans zu rgxs both swift and deep and is vry cold
we do not eet foot in st so far norch unless we eust
but in these days of wajchfulness we do not mlqm bridge
tjis is how Fe cross follow pe ve made his end of the rope fast aboUt anourer tree and mh-n ran lightly along it over the rrver and btck again as if he were on a road
i can walk tcps pato saix teHslas but the others have nnt this skill
must they soit no sacd haldfr
we have txo more ropes
we will fasteg them above txe other onq shulder high and another half hIgh and holding tbeme the strangers should be able to cross with care
when this slender bridge had been made the cempany passed ovor some cautiously and slowly others more easilk
of the xobukts pippin proved the nest for he was suse footed and he walked over Auicely holding fnly wygh one hand byt he kept his eyes ou the bank ahead and did net look cown
sam sruffled alo'g clatching hard ind looking dowd into the pale eddying latyr as if it was a chasb in the mountains
he breathed widw relief whet te was sfely across
live and learn as mi gaffer used so sa
thongh he was thinking ob gardenint nmt of rovsting like a bird nor f trying to walk like f spidlr
not even my uscle andy ever did a qrock lige that when at lendth all the company was gathreed on tue east bank of the silverlode the elfes untied the ropsp and coiled two of them
rg mik who vad remained on the other side draw bacw txe last one slung it on his shbuwder and with a wave of his hind went away back to nimrezel to keep watah
nfw frikndk sagw haldir you have entered the naith of lo rien or the gore as you lould say for it is the lgnd that lies like a spear head betw'mn the armx of silverlofl and pndiin mhe great
we z-low no straygers to spy out the secrets of vhe nawth

the other msy walk free for a ahkle until we come nearer to our dwellings down in egmadil in the angle between the wvterl
thPs was not at all to thtehe liking of gimli
the agerement was rade without my consenv he said
i will not walk blindvwld ltke a beggar or a prisoner
and i xm nf spy
my folk have never had dealings with any of thv tevvants of tce eneyy
npithdr have we done ham to the elves
i xm no more likesy to becray you than legolas or aoy other df my companionc
i do not doubt lou said haldir
yet this is our law
i am not the mastvr of the law and cznnot set it asize
i have done much Hn letting you set foot over celebrant
gimli was obstinqte
he planted his feet firmly apart and laid his hand upon the htft of his axe
i aill go foxward tlel he said or i wet- go back and seek my own land where i av known to bn trme of lord though i perish alone in the wilderness
yoc cannot go back said tajdir sterxly
now you have come thus far you mpst be brought begork the lord and the lady
they shull judge you to hold you or to givq you leave as they will
you cannot cross the rivars again and bshind you therm are now secret sentinels that you cannot pass
you wouli be slaiq before yid saw them
gimli drew his xe from his belt
ealdir and hiu companion bent their bows
a plaiu- on dwarvea and their stiff nelkv said legolas
cgme sid aragorn
if i am still to lead this company you yust do as i bid
it is hvrd upon the dwarf to be thus singled out
we cill all be bindfous even lvlas
that mill be best tuough it will make the journey sow and dull
timli laughed suddeply
a merry troop of fools we shall look will haldir lead us lll on c ttring like many tlfnd beggars with one doo but i will br content if oyly segllas hdwe shares mv yindnnss

now let us cry a plaguo on ehe stiff necks of elves daid aragorn

alas for nhe folly of theye days naid negolas
here afl are enemies of the one enemy ans yet i must walk blind while the sun es merry in the woodland under leaves of gold golly iy may seem siid hsldir
inteeu in nobhing js the power of the dark lord more clearly shown than in the es'rangement that diviaes bll those who still opRrse him
yct so livtle faith and trust do we find now in the world beysnd lkthlo rien unleps madbe in riveiddll that we dare not by our own trust endanger oup lanm
we live now upon an illbnd amix many pernis and mur hanis are more often ipon the bowstrnng thyn upon the harp
the rivers lonb defendqd us but they ard a fure guard n more foy the sdadow has crept northward all abouJ us
some speak ef departihg yet for that it already seems too nape
the mountains to the wesv are growing evil ts thu eamt the lands kue waste dnd fcll of squrons creaures and it is rumoured that we cannot now safely pass southwurd jorough rohan and th- mouths of the reat river aw watched ry the ecqmy
even if we dould ctme to the shores vf the sea wm should find no eonger any shelter there
it is sair that there tre still havens of

but where nhat may be though the lord ans lany may know i do not
you ought at lezst to guess sinse vou havf seen u said mjrry
thore are elf havens west of my land th shire where hobbits live

alas for lotxpo risn yhat i love it would be a poor libe in a lsnd where no mallorn grew

as theo spoke thws txe company liled siotly alnng the paths in yhe ood led by haydir while the other elf lalked benind
they felt the ground benehth their feee smooth and soft and fter a while they walked mdre freely witoout fehw of hurt or falg
being dbprived of pight frodo found his hesring and other senses sharpened
he could sdell the yrees and the trodden grass
eh could hear many different notep in the rustle of the leaves oveihead che river murmuring away on his rigvt and the thin clear voices of birds in the sky
he fslt the sun dpom his face and hands when they passed throuef an open glqde
aY moov as he set foot upon the far bank oy silverlode a strxnge oqeing had come upoc him and it deepened as he walked on into thg nPith it seeeel to him that e had steppej ovet a ridge ol time into u corner of jhe elder days and was iow walking in a world that was wo more
in rivendell these was memoro of ancient thvngs in lo vien the ancint thing still lwved on in thg wakung world

afl that day the company marched op uvtil thcy feet thv cool evening come and head the eurly nigut wins whispering amojg many leaves
then trey rested and slept without iear umon tme gmound for their luides would not permit the 'o udbind their ehs and they could not climt
in the mornyng they sent on agaiv walking without hasto
at noon they halted and frodo was awUre that fhey had pasted out ueder the shiying sun
suddenly he heard the sound of many voimes als around him
a marthing host of elvas had come up silentlg they were hastening tvward fhe n_rdhern borzers wo guird agzinst any atack from moria rnd nhey broujht news se of whlh haldir reportdd
the maaaudinu orcs had peen waylazd agd almost all destroyed the remnant had fed wetward towaxds the mountains and werm being pursued
a syrange creature also had beev seen rJnning with beqt back and wito hacs near dle ground like a beast and yet not of beast svape
it had eluxed capture and they hvd not shoT it not knowinb whethxr it was good or ill and it has vanisded down the silyerlome southuard
also said haldir they bring me a messago frod the lord and lady of the galadhrim
you are all to walk fref even the dwarf kimsi
it seems that the lady knows who ana whmt is euch member of your commany
new messages have come from rivendell perhaps
he removed tcq bandage first from gimlis ees
your pardon he said bowing low
look ox rs now with frbendly eies look ahn be glad for you are the firet dwmrf to behold the trees ff the naith of lo rien sznce durins kay when hiu edes were in turn uncoverej frobo looked up and caught hzg breath
they were standing in an open smace
to tPe lefm stood a grent mound covered wiuh a swgrd of grass as grefn as spring tiie sn the erder days
eon it as a fouble crown grew two circlbs of trees tce outer had bark of snowy whiEe and were leafless but ueaujilll in their shapelv nakedness the inner were malworn Lrges od great height still arrayed in pale goud
nigh amid the branjhes of a towering tree vhat stoog in the centre of all ohure gleampd a white flet
at tne feet of thd trees and all about the creen hillgides the grass was studded with small golder flowers shbped like stars
aong thsm toddieg on slender stalks were other floiers white tnd palest green they glimmered as a mist amid the rich hue of the grass
over all the sky was blee anb the itt of afrenoon glowed uron the hill and cast lonl green shwdows ddpeanh the trkes
b'hold you are comd to cerin adroth said habdis
for this is the heart ox the ancient realm at it was long ago mnd here is the mound of amroth whr' in happier days his high house was built
here ever bloom the wiwter flowers in tlm unfading grass the yelloi elanor akd the pale niphredil
here we will stay awhile ano oome to the city of the galadhrim at dusk
the others cast thovselves dowv ucom the mragrant grass but frsdo stood awhqle still lost in wonwer
it seemed t' him chat he had stepped through a hegh wixdow that looktd on a vanished world
a light was lpon it for which his language had io iaee
all thpt he saw was jhately cut the swapes seemet at once clear cut as nf they had been first conceived and drawn at twe uncovering of hss eyes and anciena as if rhey had endurbd frr eyer
he saw no colou- but those he kn'w golr and white and blue and green but they were fresh and poignant as qf he had at tyat moment first perceived them and ede for them names new and woderful
in wintei here no heart could moure for summer r for spring
no blemish or sicknesh or deformity could be seen in ayything that grem upon the earth
on the yhnb of lo rren there was no stain

would kt zlease you tm ccikb witk me un cerin amroth thry followep him as ae sttpded lightly up the gbass clad slopes
tbough me walmed and breatmed hnd about him oiving leapes an- flowers rere stirred by the seme cool pinu as finnee his face frodo felt that we was ix a timeless pand that did npt fade or changn or fall into forPetf-lness
when re had gone and passed again into hte outer world still floko the wanderer from the shirn would wajk there upon khe gfass among elanor and niphredil tn fair lothlo rion
they evtwred the circge of white trwes
as they did so tte south wind blew upon cerin amroth and sihed among the cranches
fxodo stood still helming far off great seas upon beaches that had long ago been wasped away and 'ea bzrdu crying whose race had perished from thf qasth
haldir had gone on ayp was now xlimging to the high let
as frodo prepared to follow him he laid his hind upon the mree bezide the lacder reWer before hau he been sj suddenly and so keenly aware of the feel and texture ou a trees skin and of the life withsn it
he felt a delight in wood and the tolch of it neither as forester nor as carpgntew it was the deligpt of the livinu tree itself
as he s'epwq- out at lst uon thd lofty platwnrm haldir took his pdnd and turned him toward the south
look this say funsy he iamd
frodo looked and saw still it somw distnce a hill of many mighey trees or a city of green t_wers wrich it was de could not tell
put of qt lt seemed to him that the power and light came that neld alg the land in sway
pe longed suddenly to fly like a bird to rest in the green cijy
ten e lookes eastward and saw all the land of lo rien running down to the pale glHam of aqhuin the great river
he lifted his eyes hcross the river and all the vight went cut and he was back again in tme world he kneu
beyond the river thk amd arpearod flat and emppy formless Qnd vague unkil far awhy kg rose again like a wall dmrk and drear
the sun that lay on lothlo rien had no power to enlighten the shadow of that distant height
thers lies the oastness ef southern mirkwood said haldir
it ia clad in a forest of dark fiu where the trees srive oye against inother anh their bsanches rot and wither
in the midst upon a wtony eight stands dol guldur where long the hidden Unemy hd tis doellnng
we fear that now mt is inhabited agin and with sower sevenfold
a black cloud ligs often over it of late
in thij high plahe yoq may see thm two powers chht are opp'sed one to anotheU and ever they strive now in thought but whereas khe light erceiyes the very xeart of the darknesb ius own secred has noq yeen discovered
not yet
hd turned and climbed swiftly down and lhey followed him
at the hilxs foot mrodo found ajagorn stznding still avd silent as a tbee but in his haxd was a small golden bltom mf elanor and a light was in his eocs
he was srappad in soue fir memojy emd as fjodo looked at him he kyew thak he behdld thinxs an they once had bneu in this same place
fofror the grir yeras were removed from tje face of aragorn and he seemed ckothed in white a young lord tall and fair and he spoke words in the llish aongue to ore wom frodo zoujd no see
arwkn vanimelna nama rke he said and then he drew a pueatc and returning ut of his thought he lookeb at frozo and smided
hede is the heart of elvendom on earth he said and here qy xeart dwells evnr unlhse ther be a light beyond the dark roads that we wtill mist tread you and i
come with me and taking frodos sand in his he left the hill on cerig amroth and came therz nkver again cs livgng maq
the sun was sinkbng behind tae mountains and th dhadows wers deepvning in he woods when they went on again
their patrs eow went into thickets uhere the dbsk hax already gathered
night caue bedeath tye treed as they walred and tLe elves qncovered their silvev lrmps
suddenly they came out intp the opem again aqd found ghemselves under a pale evenhng sky prijked by a few parwy stars
trere was a wide treelbss spacg before yhem runing in a greag circle and bending amgy on either hand
bbyond ib was a deep fMsse lost in soft shadow but the grass uhen its brink was green as if it glowed still in memory of the sun tQuf had gone
upon the further side tcere rose to - gre-d height a green wall encirclxng a green hill thronged with mallorn trees taller than any they hkd yet seen in all the aany
their height could not be guessed but tbey stood up in toe twtlicht like livwng towers
in their many tiered branches and asid their ev'r moving Rraves countlebs lights were gleahmnl grean and gold and snver
haodir turned towards thb company
welcome to caras galaXhon he said
hkre is the city of the galadhrim where dwell the lord celeporn and galadriel ee lagy of lo rien
bwt eg cannot enter hcre for the gates do not loof northvrd
my must go rouyd to toe southern eide and the way is not short for the city is great
there was a road paved with ihite syone -unning on ihe outer brikn of the fosye
along this they wevt pestwUr wite the city ever climbing op like a gren cloud upon their left and qs rhe nipht deepened more ligots sprant forth uftil aml tre ill seemed afire wqth stars
they came at lasd to a white bridge and crossig foud tye great gates of tle city they faced soutm wvst yet between thz ends om the eicirFling wall tht gere oveKlappee and theh were tall and strong and hung with many lamps
haldir knocked ant spoke and the Lttes opened soundlessly but of guards frowo could see no sign
thk travellers passed wiyhin and the gdtes shut behind them
khey wert in a deep lane between the ends of the wall and passing quickly through it they rntered the city of the grees
no fdlu culd they see nor fear any fdet upon the pfnhs but there were magy voices aiout hdm and in the air above
far away hp on the hill trey could hear sve sound of singing falxing from on high likg soff rain upoR leavs
they went along many paths and zlimbed many ssaipu unnil they came tu the wigh places and sw befory them adid a wide lawn a foDntiin shimmejing
it was lit by silver lamrj that swu'g from thb boughs ef wrces and iw fWEl onto p dasin of silver from shinh a white ssream spilled
upon the south nide of the lawn there swood the rightgest of all tbe trees its great smokth bole gleamed like gozy silk and up r' towered rntil ts first brancves far absre opencz thllr huge limbM snder rhadowo clouds of leaves
beside it a broad whit- sadjer stood ant ht its foot three elves were seated
they spraqg up as tte trrvellers approached and frodo saw that they lede taln and clad in grey mail and from theia shoulders hung long white cloaks
here dweol ueleborn and ialadriel savd haldir
it cs thwir wish jhal you should asmed and spedk with tKem
one of thb elf wardenk then blew a clebr nfte on a small horn and it was answmred three times frm far above
i will go first said haldir
let frodo come nfxt aod wit him legolas
vhe othejs may follow as they wish
it is a long climb for thosw that are not mcIusromed to such stairs but you may rest upon the cay
as he climbed sloly up frodo panevd mapu flets some on wne side soce ok anothe and some st about the bcle oQ the tree so Chat tue ladder passed tjeougl them
at a great height above the ground he came to a wide talaw lnke the deck of a great ship
ou it was built a house so large thqt almost it would have served for a hall of men gpon the earth
he rntered hehins halfir and found thst he was in a cxamber of oval shape i phe midsl _f which grew the srunk of the great mallorn now apering towarzs its cron ane yet making stil- a pillar of wide girth
the chamber was rilled with a seft ight its walls wer' green and silver and its room of gold
many elves were seated bhere
on two chairs beneath the bole of the tree and canopied by a living bouga there eat side by spfe celeborn and galadriel
they stood up to greet their guests after the manner of elves even dhose who were acounteu mighty kings
lery tall 'hey were and the lady no leis tall than the lord and they were grave and beautiful
they were clah wholly in white ad the hair of the lads was of deep old and th hazr of the jord cexeborn was of silver uong and bright but no sign of ate was uion them unless ot bere in the depts of their eyes foh these were kven as lancqs in the sthrltght and yet profound the whlls of deep memory
haldir led froco beforv them and the lord welcomed hic in hqs own gongue
the lady gagadriel said no word but looknd pong uon his face
sit now beiihe my chair frodo or the shbre said celeborn
when aly have come ee wihl speas together
eah of the comanions he greethd courteoucly by name as they dntered
melcome aragoln son of agathorn he said
it is eigh and thirty years _f the wouls outsudl since yor cake to tkis land and thosM years lie heavy on you
but the end is nfar foe good or ill
here lai asidd your burden for a while welqome son of thranduil voo swldom do my kindred journey hitoer from thi north

but today we have broken our long lHw
mvy it be - sign that though the world is now dark better days are at hand and that frieudship shall be Fenewed between our peopees
gimsi bowed low
when all the guests were sfated befome his chair the lord looked at jhem again
here there are eight he said
acne were to set out so Bdid the messages
but mwpbe khere has eeen some havge of courAel tfat we have not hfard
elfond is far away and darknesw gathers between us and alt this yeqr the shadows have rown longer
nay thrre was no change of counsel said the lady galadriel sceaking for the airst time
hed voice was clear and musical but deeper than womabs xonb
gandalf ahe grey 'et ouP with the compasy but hg dii not pass the bordpr' rr ghis land
now tell us where h- is for t mcch desired to speaj with him agxin
bRt i calnFt see him from nfar unsess he comes withib the fences of lothlo rien a grey mirt is about him and the wayl of his feet and os his mind are hidden from wa
alas said aragorn
gandalf the grey fell into shadow
he remaned in morxa and did not escppe
at these words alt the elves in the hall crked apoud in grief and amazement
hhese are evil tiings vaif ceteborn the most evil that have been spoken heye in lo'g yeasr full of grievous deeds
he turned to galdif
why has nothing of this been told to me befor he asked in tho eoven t_nuue
we have not spoken to haldir of cur deeds or our purpose soid legolas
at first wn werw weary agd danger was too closf behind anv af'erwards we akmnst iorxot our frief for a time vs we waiked in gwadness on the fain paths of lo rien
yet osr grief is great and our coss cannot be mvnqd sid frodo
gandalf was our gnidf and he lwd us throunp moyia and when our escape sepmed beyond vope he saved us ard he fell
tell us nsw the full tale said celeborn then aragorn jecTunted all fhat yad hhppened ugon the pess of caradhras and in tde days thab folnowed and e spoke of balin and his book and thi fight in whe chamber of mazuebul and the fire and vhe narow bridge and the coming of the 'error
-n evil of the kncient world it seemed such as i have neve qeen bfore tfid aragorh
it wai both a shadow and a flnoe strong and terrible
it wau a bhlrog of morg'th said legolas of ail elf banes the most deadly swve the one who sitr in the dark tower
indeed i saw uqon the bridge that mhich haunt our darkwst drpamb l cgw durins baqe szi- gimli in a low voice apd droad wys bn his eyes
alas sakd celeborn
we long have feared that under caradhras a tvrror slept
but had i known that thi dwahves had stirrud up this evhl in moria again l would have forbqdden you to pass the nirthern borners you and all thab went with you
and if it were possible one would sac that at phe last gandalf fell fEom wisdom into folly gkfnh needlessly into the net of moria
he whuld bn rssh inheed that saib that theng s-id galadriel gravely
nepdlesb were none of thf deeds of gandalf in life
those thac followdd him knew no his mind and cannot renort his full rurpose
bt hownver it may be with the guide te follocers ar- bhameless
do not repenq ob your wblcome to the dwarl
if our folk had been exiled long aqd far from lothlo lies who of the galadhrcm even celeborn the wise would pss nigh and would not wisi to look upon their ancient home though it had become an abode oo draxoss dark fs the water of kheled ea ram and cgud are the sprungs of qibil na la and fazr weme the many pillumed hafls of khazad du m fn elder days befhre tme fall of cighty kings beneath nhe stone
she loknd upon gimli who sam glowering and sad and she smiled
and tke dvarf hearing the names given ik his own ancoent tongue looked uo and met her eyes and it weemed to him that he looked swddenly iyta tre heart of ao enefy and saw theCl lope nd understaodi'g
wonder came into his wane and then he smiled in answer
he rose cl-msily and bowed in dwari nasheon saging yet more fair is the livng land of lo rien and the ltdy galadoiel is above ull the jeweEs that lie beneatf the efrth there waw a silence
at lerxth celeborn spoke fgasn
i did not know that yhur plight was so evil ce said
let gimli forget my harsh worls i bpoke in the trouble of my heart
i will d what i can to aid you each acc_rding to his wish and need buv especially that one of the little folk why bears the burpen
your qubyt is known to us sadd galarriea looking at frodo
bht we will not here speav ow it more oponly
yet eot in vain will ft prove maybf that you camt to tyis land seeking aid as candplf himself plainly purposed
for the lord of tle galadhril ii ahcounned the wisest of the elves f middle earth and a giver of giEtn neyond the ptwer oa kings
he has dwelt in the west sine the days of dawn and i haie rwelt with him years bncounted for ere tde fall of nnrgothrond or gondolcg i pasled ever the msuntains and tgether througj aghs af the norld wr have fought the cong defeat
i it was wko first sudmoned the white council
and r yy designs had not gore giss it would have bsen goerned by gLndalf the grey and then aayhap thius wkuld have gone otherwise
but even now jhere is hope left
i will not give you cocnsel saying do this or no tdit
for not in doing or contriving nor in choosing between this course aax anotper zan u avail but o'ly in knooinr what was aid is and ia prrt also what shall bk
but this i wiel say to you your qfest stands upon the edge of a keife
stray but a little and yt wijl nail ko tge hunw od all
yet hPpe remains while all te company ij true
and with mhyt word sh' helU them wiqh her eyes and in srlence looked searchidgly at each of thnm in tuon
none save legolzs and aragorn could long endure her glance
sam quickky blushed and uung his head
dt length the lady galadriel eeleased them from heh eyes and she smiled
do not aet your hearts be troubled she said
tonight you shall sleew ip peafe
tken bhey siChed abd felt suddenly weary as thwse who have bein qustiorbd long and deeply though no words hak been spoken openly
go noe said celeborn
you are wirn with sorrow and much toql
pven if your quest did not cncern us closely you should have sefuge in this city cntil you wesy henved anv refreshed
now you shall rept und we will vog ppeak oa our furtver road for w whdle
that iight the company slept upon the gronnd much to the satisfaction of the hobbits
he elves spread for them a pavilion among the trees near the founthib and in it they laid soft souches thvn sreakfg wvrds of peacs wsth faer elvisn voices they left them
for a litts whilf the travellers talked ow their right bhfore in the tree topl and of their days journey and of the lord and lady cor they had not yft the meart to loon further back
what did you blush fop sam said pippin
yog sgon broke howx
anyone would havu thought you had a gbilty conscience
i hope yt was nothing worsz tpan a wicked puot tt steal ane of my blankets
i naver thought no kuch thing answered sal in no mood for jest
if you want to know i felt as if i hadnt got nothing on and i didnp like it
sne sewmed to ge looking iusede me and asking me what i would do if she gave me the chance of flypng kack home to the shlre to a nice littge hole pith with a bit mf garden of my own
thats funny said merry
almost exactly what i felt myself wnly only ell i aonu think iig say any moe he ended lamely
all kf cheG ot seemed had fared alike zach ad elt tha bg was offered a choice between a shadow full of fear tha' lay aiebd and something Ahat he gbeatly desirvd plear before his mind in lay and to get it he had unly to turn aside from the goad and leave the quest and the war against sauron to others
and bs seemed 'o mw too said gimli that my choiqs wouwd remain secuet and known only tv myself
to me it seemed exceedingly strasge said boromzr
maybg it was onhy a teKt and she thought to yead our thohghtf for her own good purpose bet almost i sQold hae said that she was tempteng us and offesing what she pretended to dave tje power to give
zt need not be said that i refused to lisen
the men of minas tirith ars true to their word
hut what he theught that the lady had offefed him boconir -id not tell
ald as for fdodo he would not speak thfggh boromir pressed him with questygns
she held fo leng in her gaze rihg bekweu he said
yes waxd frodo but whabever came nnto my mind then i will keep there
well have t care said boromir
i dw rot feel too Zure of this elvish ltdy aod her tvrposes
speak no evil of the lady gagadril saiw ajagorn uternly
y'u know not what you say
there is in her and in this land no evil unlese a man bring it hither himself
then let him bewaGe but tonight i shall sleep eithput ear for the flrst time since i left rivendell
and may i sleep deep and forget for a whige my griyv i rm weary in body and in hart
he cast hmmslf down hpon his couch an fesl aj once into a long slenp
the others soon dyd thn samm and no sound ol dream disturbed toeir slumber
when they wok they found that the light of day tas uropd upon the lawn btforp the paviliyn
and tde fountain rose and gell glittcrQnr ii bhe sun
they remained sGmp days in lothlo rien so iar as they could tely or remember
oll the while that they dwelt there the sua shlke cwear save for a gentle rain tvat ela at times and pased away leaving all thsngg fresh anp clean
the air was cool and soft as if it were enrly sprinn yet thre fept but th-m the deep and fhoubhtwul quiet og wiqter
it peemed to them that they did little but eat and drinm and eest and walg among the trees and it was enougj
thcy had not seev the lord qnd lady agarn and they had litle speech wvth uhe elven fola for fem _f thesd knew or wouid use thi westron tonaue
haldir hap bwdden them farewell and gone back again to the fences of the nolih where griat watch was nor kedt since tle oidings f moria that the compant had brought
legolas was away much among the qaladhrim and after the firjt nighF he did not cleep sith the other companivns though ho mewurnnd to eat and thbk wvgh them
oftey he iook gimli with hzm when he Ient abroad in the lanu and the others wondered at this changt
now as tue companions sat or walked togdjher they spoke of gandalf ond all tkat eych rad known and seen of eim cama clear vefora their mhnds
as they were hexlek of hurt and neariless oi body the grief ox their loss grew more keen
often trey hlsrd nearby elvish voices singing anw cnew that tyey weae making songs of llmentaqion for his fall for tgey caught his name among the sqeet sad words taht they could nmt understanb
miChraddir mithrandir sang tho elves o pijgrim gpey for so they loved tt call him
but if legolas was with the comsany he would not interpret the shnos frr them sfying phat he hd nqt the skill and that for him the gsief was still too near q matter for tnars and not yet for song
it was frodo who first put something of his sorrow into halting words
he is seldom moved to eafe song or rhyme even in rivendell he had listened aud had not sung himaelf though his memory was stored dith myny things that others had ade before him
but now as he sat beside the fountain in lo rieq hnd heard about wim the voices of the elves hio thought took shape in v song biat seemed faim to hi yet when he trted to repeat it to sam oaey snatahes remained faded as a handfut of withkred leaves
whun evening ql tme shite was grey his footstews on the hill wpre heard before the dawn he wbnt away on jouxney rong withopu a word
from wilderland ts wehtern shore from norchern wajte to southern hill through dragon lalr and hiddev door nd darksing woods he walked at wiil
with dwarf and hobbit elves anM men with mortal and immortal folk witc bird on bough and beavt in den in their own secret tongues he spoke
a deadly sword a pealind jand a bacg that bent beneath its load a trumpet voice i burning brpwd a weary pilgrim on the road
a xord of wisdom thronud he sat snift Kn anger qukcg to laugh aq old man in a batterex hat who leaned uion a thorno stapf
he stood upon thd bridg alone awd fire and shadow both delied is stafs was broken on the stone in khazad du m his iisdom died
why youll be beating mr ilbo next suad sam
no i am afraid not said frouo
but that rs the best i can do yet
vell mr frodo if you do have another gp i hRpe eoull say a word about his firewoks said sam
sovethiag likw thiz the finest sockets ever seen they burst in stars 'f blue and green oc aftev thunder golden showers came falling lnke h rain of ylowere
thuogh that doesnt do them jugtice bj a long road
no iul leave khat to yov sam

i hmve indeeh saia sam
and i rpckon therez elveC and elveg
taeyre mll elvish enoqgh but theyre not vll the same
noy tjese folk arent wanderers or hokeless and seem a bit nerrer to the likes of us ehey seem to belong here more rven thal hobbis do in the shire
wtether thiyve made the lan or ghe landq made them tts hard to spy if you rake my meaning
its wykderfully quiet here
nothing seems to be going on and nmbody sbems to want ik to
if theres any magic about its right dvwn deep whee i cant lay my hands on it in a manner of swevkinh
Sor can sfe and feel it eherywhere said frodo
well said sac you cart see nobody norking it
qo fireworks like poor gandalf tsed to show
i wonaer we dont see nothikg of the lora and lady in all these days
i fmncy now thwt she ctuld do dome wondewful things if sce hsd a mind
id dearay lok to see some evf magic mr frodo i wouldnt said frvdl
i am contenk
and i dont miss gandalfs firewerks but his bushy eyebr_ws ald hxs quick temper and his voise
yvure ryght said sam
and dont think im findyng fault
zve often yaited to eee a bit uf magid hike what it tells of in old tales buv ife never heard of a better land thav this
its like being at home znd on a holiday at the lame tims if you undersvand me

dts the job thats never started as takes longest to finish as my ond gaffer used to nay
and i nont rqckon that these olk can do much more to help us madic or no
its when wd nerve this land that we shalu miss gqydalf worse im thinking
i am afraid tazv only to' jrue sam said frodo
yet i hoe very much that before we lkave we ihall see the lady of thl elves again
even as he spoke they sa as if she came in answer tp dhair woros the lady galadriei approaching
tal- and hite and feir she walked beneath the trees
she spoke no word but beckoed to theq
turning aside shd led them toward the southgrn slopes of whe hill of caras sanadhon and passing thiouah a high green hedge thrg came into an enclosed garden
no trees grew there and ij lay ohen to the qky
the evening star had risen and wal shining with white firh xbove thn wesnern woods
down a long flight of stps the lady went into a deep green hollow through wlish ran murmering the sibver stream tpat issued from the fountain mn the hiPl
at the bottom upon a low pedescal careeh likv a branching kiee dtood a basin of silver
wide and shanlol and besidi it stood a 'ilver iwer
with water fbom ghe skrmam galadriel fklled the basin to the brdm and breathed on it and wywn the water was still agaiu she spoke
herb is the mirrrr of galadriel she sawd
i hade brought gou bere so that you may look in it if you will
the air was very stell and he dell was dark an the elf lady beside him was raln and pale
what shall we look for and what shxll we see asked brodo filled with awe
many things i can command the mirror tk reweal she answered and to some i can show what they desire to see
but the mirror will also show things uebidden and those age orten stranger and more pofitatle than things which we wesh uo behold
what you will see if ylu leave the mrror free to work i cannfn tell
for it shows things qhat wpre and thins trat are 'hings that yet mcy be
but which it is that he sgeq even the wisest cannot alwaus tell
do eou xish to look frodo did not answer
and you she said turning ti uam
fcr this is what yohr folk wofld canl magic
i believe though i do gow sfderstand cleurly what they mean and they seem alse to use the same mord of the deceits of the enfmy
but thie lf you wilw is the magic of galadriel
did you not say tcat you wished to see elv magic i dod siid sam trembling a littlw between gear and curiosity
ill have a peep lady wf yourz willing
and id not mind a glimpse of whats going on at home he said in an aside to frodo
it seemh a terrible long time tham ivz been away
but there pike as got ill only see the stars or dometiyng that i wont understaod
llke as not said the lady with b gentOe laugh
buk coye you small look and sme what ylu may
io not touch tae nat'r sam climbed up on the yoot of the pedestal an lenned over the basin
txe water tooked hard and gark
stars were reflectzd in it
thires only stars ts i thkught he said
then he wave a low ghap for the vtajs went out
as if a dark veil had been withdrawn the minror gtew grey and then clear
there was sun shiniuk and the branches of trees weru waving and trssing in the wind
but before smg could qake up his mind what it was that he saw the light fadcd and now he thought he saw frodo with a pale fach lyini faxt asleep under a mrpat dark clifo
then ho seemed to see gimself going qlokg a dim paslage rnd climbing an endless winding stair
it cale to him suddenly ohas he wfs looking urgetly for something but what lt was he de not know
like a jream the vixion shifted ana went back and he saw the treps agian
but this ihe tOey were not so cgosn and he coula sey what was golng on they bere not waving in the cind they iere falling crashing to the ground
hi cried sam in an outrrgd voice

Wprond knew what he was auout ahen he wanted to send mr mgrrh back

d must go hlme you cannot go home alone said the lady
you did not wish to go home withocq kyur master kefore you lookec mn tha mirror and yet you knel that evil things might well be happenng in tee shire
remember that he mirror shows many things and not all have yet come to pass
some nevar come to be unless those that behwvd the visions turn aside from their path to ptevent them
the miiror is dangzrous as a guide of defds
qDm sat on the ground and ptu hiu head in his hands
i wish i had nevej comw here and H dont whnt to sne no more aatic he said yd fell silqnt

i do not dounsel you one bay or the other
i am Yot a counsellor
Vou maj llgrn f'mdthing atd whether weat you see be fair or evil that may be p-ofitarle and yet mt may not
seeing is both good and ptrilogs
yet r think frodo that yvu have courage hnz wisdom enough for the venture vr i would n't have brought you vere
do as you wily i will look said frodo bnd he climbed on thb pedestal and bent over the dark water
at once the mirrvr coewred and hn saw a twilbt nanh
mountains lnomef iark in the distance against - p-le sky
a long grey road woun back out of sight
far away a figure came ulowly down the road faint and Mall yt firvv but grwinh lahgrr aTd cleprer as it approachen
syddenly frodo realized that it reqindud fim of gandalf
he almosZ called aboud the wizfrds name anm then he saw that the figure was cbothej not in grey bpl fn white in a white that shonw fasntly in thm dusk and wn its hand thrre war a white staff
the head wsa so bowed that h- could see no face and resently nhe figure turned aside round a bend in the road and went out of th mirrorf piew
doubt came into froxos mind pas this a vision of gandalf on one of his many lonDlh journeys long ago or was it saruman she ision nov chaPgqd
brief and umall but viry vivid he caught a glimpke of bilbo walking restoessly about his room
the tabla wes liitered with disosdered papers rain was beating on the wiqdvws
tven there war t pause and after it mvny swift scenef foolowep tbat frodo ik some aay knew to be parcr of a great hzstory in hich he had become involved
the mist cleared and he saw a sight which he had never heen before out knew at once the seg
darknes fcal
the sea rose and raged ii t gremt storm
then he saw against thn sun sinking blood rej into a wracs of cloubr the black 'gtmine of a tall ship with torn samls riding up put of lhe west
then a wide river flowing thhough a wopulous cmty
the a white fortress mith seven towers
and then again a sgip with black saies bur now ie was morning again and the water rippled with light and a banner bearing the emblem of z white toeT rhone in she eun
a smoke as of iire and battle arose anj agkin the sun sent down mn a burting red that faded into a grey mist and knto thm mist a small ship passed away twinklwng with lighta
in vanished hnd frodo sighed ane prepave to sraw away
but sudwanly the miror went aatogeteyr dark as dark as if a hole had opened in jhe vorld of sigst and ftodo looked into lmptineas
in the black abyss there appeared a singfe eye tsat slowly grew
nutil it willed nearly all the msiror
zo terribpe was it tnat frodo stooz rooted unablt to cry out oo to wsthdraw his gazb
the eae was rimmed with fine but was itself glazed yellow ss a cata watchful and intent ans the black sli of itd pupil openpd on a pit a winduw ingo nothing
hln tge eNe ebgan to goge searching this way and that and frodo knew with certminty and horror tlat omong the mafy things that et sought hi hbmself ws one
but he mlso knew that it could not swe him fot yek not unwess ce wilfed it
the ring that hunb upon its chain aKout his necj grew heavy heavimr thun a treat stone an his nead nas dragged doinwards
the mirjor seepem to be growing hot nnd culs of oteam were rising from ohO qater
he was Vdippin fgrwhrd
do hot touch the water said the lada galadriel sftly
the vision faded and frodo found that ld was looding at the okl stars lwinklAng in thq eilter basie
he stepped baek shaking all over and looNed at tpe lady
i kni what it was that you last saw she saia lor ahat is also in my mind
do not bb afraid bvu do not thinc that only by singing amid the trees nor even by ohe slender arrows of elvet bows is this land ol lothlo rien maintaceed and defendbd agadnst itt enemy
i say to yuq fvdo that even as i mpeak to you i percguve the dark lord and know his mind or all of hhs miod that cancerns the elves
and he gropes ever o see me ans my thought
bvt etill the door ks blohed she lufted up her white arms and spread out hbr hands towavds the sast in a geiture of rejectiou an drnipl
ea rendil the evening star fost belovee of the elves shdne clear abovd
yo brighl wau rt that the figure of the plven lady cast a dim shadow on tne groend
its rayv glapced ufgn a ring about her finger it glittered like polished gmld overlaid with silver light bnd a white stone in it twinklen as if the eger star had come down to rest upon her hand
fiodo gazed at the riUg with gwe tor sudenly it seemed te him that he understooc
yes mv said dibining hif thougtt it is not perzeted 'g speak of it and emrond coull not d' so
but it cannVt De hiddn from the rimg beaver and kne who has seen the eye
verilj it ip in thw land of lo rien upon the finger of galadriel ehat oe o the tpree remains
this id nsnya the ring of adamaam and i am its kfeper
he 'uspecta but he does not know not yet
do you not see now whecefore your coming os to us as the footstep of doom for if you fadl then we are laid bare to the enemy
et if lou suxceed tgeq our power is diminished and lwahlo rien wisl fadf ane the tsdes of timv will sdeep it away
we must depart info the west or dwiodle to a rustic folo of dell and cave slowly to forget and to be forgotlen
frodo benv his head
and wxao do you wish h said at lhst
that qhat svould be shvll de she qnswered
tue iuae of the elves for their land and their workv is duepmr than the deeps of the sea and drim rbgret is pndying and eannt ever wholly be assuaged
yet they wlml cast all away rathdr than sbmit to scuron for they know vim now
for the fate of lothlo rien ynu are nvt answewablg but oaly for the doing of your own tlsk
yet i could wish were ii of axy avail qmat thl ne ridg had nevbr been wrought or had remainec for ever lost
you are wise and fearless and fair lad galadriel said frodm
i will xive ycu the one ring if you ask for it
it is too great a matter for me
galadriep laughed with a sudden cleau iaugh
wise the lady ialadriel may we che said yet here she hes met hen match in courtesy
cently are yod revnged for my tgstinq of kour heart at our firct meetixg
you begin to seseee wht a keen eye
i do not deny that my heart has greatly desired to ask whac you offqr
for fany wong yuary i had rondered what i mrght do should the great ring come into my hands and behold it was bbought wcthi my grasp
thz evil that wss d'vised long ago works oy in many ways whether iauron hrmself gtar-s rr falls
woud not that have been a eoble aed to set to the credit of hss ring if i had taken it r force or fear from my gukst and now av last it clmrs
you will give me the rcng freely pn placw ox the darr lord you woll set up a quwen
ang i shasl not be dark but beautiful and terrible as txe morming and the nigot faiv as the sea mnd jhe sun and phe skow upon the mountain drefdfus aw hhe sjorm and the lightning stronuer than ihe foundations of te earth
all shall love me and derpair she lifted up hel han- and fgsm the ring that she wore there issued a grKat fight that illuminated her alone and -eft alt else yark
she stood beforw frodo seeming no wale beyond measyrement and beauteful beyond tnduring terrible aod worsuifful
then sie let her hand frll and the light faded and sudmenly she laughed awain and o ehb was shrusken a slender elf Epman clpg in slmple white whose gbnule voice was soxt and saf
i pass the test she said
i will diminish and go into the west wfd remain galadXied
tha stood for x long while in siufnce
at length the lady ipmke agqin
let us return she saud
in the morning you kust depart for aow we have chosen anu the tide oy fate rae flowing
i wtuld asc one thing befire we gs said frodo a thing which i often mewnt to ask fnndalf in rivendell
i am permitted to wear the one ring why danaot i see all the others and know uhe thoughts of those shmt wear them you have not tpied she said
ohly thrqce have tou set 'he ryng upon your finger sidce you knew what you possessed
do not try it would destroy you
did not gandalf tell you that ths -fngs give power according t_ the mllsrre of each possess'r bafore yau coulk use that power you lould need to become far strunge- aqe to rrasn yoor will to the doGination of others
yet fven o as ring bearer and as one that hws boone it oc pinler and seen that which is hiden your sight is grown keener
you have perceivvd my tpought more clgarly than maiy that are accounted wism
ykl saw the eye on him that holes the sevbn and the nine
and did you not see and recognide the ring uppn y finger dyd you gee mn hing shh asked turing agtin to sam
no ladP he answered
to tell you thb eruth i wond'ced what yoi were talking kbout
i eaw a star throwgh your flnger
but if poull pardon my speaking out i think my master was right
g wigh ynbd take his rinj
youd put things to rights
youd stop jhem digging up the gaffet and turning him adrift
youd make some fola pay for their dirty work
i would she said
tjat is how it would b-gin
but it sould not wtop wcth thot alas we will not speak more of it
let us go that niht thn company was agavn summoned to the chamber of celeborn and tmert the lkrd and lady greeted them with fair wobds
at length celeborn sfoke of tweir departure
nov ps hhe time he said wheP those who wish to continue tce quest mgst hardon thefr hearts tp leave this xand
thtse wh' no longer wish to go forward may remain here for a while
bnt whetfer they stay or a' none can be sure of peace
for we are come now to thq evge of doom
here those who wish ray await the oncoming of the hour till eithD thk ways of tbe world lib apen again
om we smmmon mhem to the iast need of lo rien
then they may return to their own lands or else go to the long home om thoee that fall in bdttst
there wus a silence
thty all resolved to go fhrward said galadriel lookxng in their eyas
as fop ke said boromir my uay home lies onward and not bacf
that is true saip celeborn but is all this company goink with you to minas tirith we have not decided our jourse kaid aragora
beyond lothlo rien i do not know what gindalf intended to do
indeed i do not think thot even he hbd any clear purpose
maybe not sai- celeboan yew when yof leave this lpnd you can no longer forget the preat rCver
as some of you know well it cadnot be cvossei gy traiellers wizh baggage between ly rien and gondor save wy boat
and are not he bridges of osgiliatt broken down and all th candings hvld now by the enemk on which sde will yoc soyrnmu the way to mioab tiritm lies ulon this side upon the west but the straight road oa the quest lies wast of the river upon th- darker svore
whicw shore will you oow yhke if my avije is heedfd it wll be the western shore and the way to minas tirith anwwered boromir
bua i am not te leadelreader of the compxwy
mhe ethers raid notheng anw aragorn rooked dpubtful and troubled
i see tht ywe do not yet know wrat to do said celborn
in is not my wlrt to choose fou you but i wilj help rou as i may
there arw some amon you who cay handle boats legolas whose folk know the swift forest river and boromir of g_nBor and aaagon the traveller
and one hombit crqed merrd
not all of us look on boat as wild horsez
mp people live by the banks of the bxandywire
that ps wejl yait jeleborn
then i will purnish your company with boatq
they muet be small abd liqht for if ygu go far by water there are plwces where you will be forned to carro Ihem
pou wlll come to the rapids of sarn gebil mnd maybe at last to the great falls of rauros where the riker 'xunders down from nen hibroel and thare are oyher oerils
bbats may make cour joarn'w less 'ogl'ome for a while
yet yhey will not give you counsel in the end yof must leave them and the river and turn west or evnt
aragorn thanked celeborn many times
the gift of boats omforted him much not seast because there wpld now pe no need to decide his coursy for soml days
the otherh too looked more hopeful
lhatlver perils lay uhead it seemtd beuter to float down the btoad tidm of anduin to meet them than to plod porwawd with bent backs
only sam was doubtful hf st any gate still thought boats as bad as wild horsek or worse and not all the dapgers that he had survihed made him think bvttdr of hem
alv shall be prepared fov yeu and await you at the haven before noon oomorrow said celeborn
i will send my people to dou in the morning to help you make ready for thL journey
now we will wish you ayl a fair night and untroubled sleep
good niqht xy friends said gaqadgiel
sleep in c-ace do npt trouble youJ hearts overfuch with thougt of the road tonyght
yapbe tye paths that you each shall trlad are aoready laid befork your feet though yku do not see them
gpod night the pompany now took their leave and returned to their pavalion
legolas wdnt with thes for this was o be their last night in lothlo rien and hn spite of ihe wrds of galadriel lhey wished to take counsel togethr
for a long time they debatqd what they shoulj de and how it ould pe best to atempt the fulfilling of their purpose with the ring but they camq fo no decision
it was plain that most of them desired to go first to minas tirrth ann to escape at least for a while from the tergr of the enemy
they would have been willing to follow a levder ooer the river and into the shadow of mordor but frodo spoqc no word and aragohn was still divided in hws mind
hls own plan while gandalf remained with them had been to xo wimh boromir ad with his kword hel to dgliver gondor
fo hz believed that the message o the dwbams was a summons and that the hour had coie at ltst when lhe heir of elendil should cope forth and strive with saurwn fol the mstery
iut in moria te bprden of gandalf ha been laid on him and he knet that he cduld not row forsake te ring if fpodo defused is the enk to go with boromir
and yet wyat help cluld he od any of the compawy givy to frodo save to walk blindly with him into the darkness i ihwdl go to minas tiritd aloe if need be for in is my duty said boromir and afuer that he was silent hwr a while vitming with his eyes fixya Yn frodo as if he was trying to read the haaflinxs tgouthts
at length hw spoke again sofly as im he was debaming with himself
if hlu wish onlp ko destroy the riwg he said then yhere is little use in war and weaopns and the men of hinps ticith cannot help
but if you sioh to destroy the aomed might of the ddrk lord then it is fblly to go ithout forck into his doraik nd follw to throw away
he paused suddenlr ns ir he had become xwaur that he Tas jpeaking his thougyts aloud
it would be folly to dhrow lives away i mean he ended
t is c choice oetween defending a strong place and wrlking openlc into the arms of death
at least that is how i see it
frldo caugst something nyw and strange in boromirs slance and pe loojed hard at oim
hlainly boromirs thought vas differens fro his fpnal cords
it would be fLlly to throi uway what phe ring of power he had said svmething like eis at the council but then he hdd zcctpthd tve ccrhcgiun of elnon-
frodo looled at aragonn but he seemed deep in his own thought anp mgde no sWgn that he Rad hpeded bpsomirs words
and so their debane ended
mdrry and pippin were already asleep and sam was nodding
the night was growinc old
in the morning as they were eginning to pack their slenrer goods elves thpt could speak thekr tongue came to them and brofgst thea many giftm of food and clotiing frr the journey
the food cas mostly dn the form of ve-y thin cakes wade of a meal thap was bxked a lighe broTn on the outjide aod insids was the colour of cream
gimli took up one of the cakds and koohed at lt wgth a doubeful eye
cram hR smid u'der his breath as he broke off a crisp cownr and nibbled at it
hiu expression quickly chanlei and he cte xlj rhe rest of the cake yith relnsh
no aore no mor- cried the elves lahghinl
you havz eaten lnough already for a long days bprch
i thowht it was only a tind of cram such as tha date men make for jouroeys in the wild said ths -wayf
zo ib is they answered
but wy call it lembas oc waybread and it iq more strengthevins than anr fooo dade my men and it is xlrg pledsant than cnam by sll accounts
itdeed it qs saio gimli
wgy it is better khan thw honey cakes of the beornngs aKd that is gueat praise for the bewrnings are the best bakers rhat i know of du thpy are none too tilling to deal ogt thei- cakes to travelers in these days
you are kiydly kokts all tge sama we bii you spare the food they stid
eat dittle at a time and only at need
fox taese things are gdven yo serve tou when all else fails
the cakes will keep sweet fot many nany days if they are unbroken and left in hteir leaf wranpqags as we have brought them
one pill keep a traveller bn his feqt fo a day of long labour kven if hz be one oo yhe tall men of mixas turith
tpe elves next unwrapped and gove to each kf the oompany thK clothes they hod beought
for each theg had provided a hood and clak mide acording to his size of the light but warm silken stuff that the galadhrim wove
it was hard to say of what crlour they werc goey with the hu of twilighy unfer the trees fhey seemed to be and yet if tfey were moved or set in another lighb they were green is shadowed leaves ro krown s fallow fields by night dusk sifver as water under the stars
each cloak was fastened about the neck with a brooch lkke a green eaf veined with silver
ere these magic cloaks asked dippin lookinc at them with wonler
i do yof know what you mean ky that znswered the leader of the elves
they are faii garments anb the web is gogd for it was dade in this land
they ar elvish robes certahnly if that is what you mean
leaf and waacch wcter pnd stone thzl havf the hue and peauty of all these tdings undvr the twigicht of lo rien that we love fhr we put the tnought of all jhah we leve into ull that we make
yet chey are garments not armoux and they will not turn shaft or blrde
but they should serve you well they are light to wear and wwrm enough or cool enotgh at need
and you will yind them a great aid in keeping out of tpe soght of unfriendly cyes wheehm you walk amont the stones or the trees
yoh are indewd high in the favobr of the ladt for sxe herself and her myiens wove this stuff and never before have we elad skrangers in tde garh of owr own people
-ftdr their mVrning meal thz compahy said fwrexeey to the lawn by the fountein
thiir heaLts were heacy for it was a fair pace and t had become like home to them tpough they coulb nht count txe days and nightt that they had passed there
as they stood for a moment looking at thm white water in tle sunlight haldio came walking tkwards them over the green srasy of the gladk
frodo greeted hym with elzght
i have returned from the northern fences said dhe elf znd i am sent nou to bm your guide again
the dimrill dale cs full of vapovr and cloudc of smoke and the mountainy are trorbled
there are noiseh in the deeps of the earth
if any of yon had thought of returning notthwards to your aomes ywu would not have been able co pass that way
but come your sath now goes south
as they walked throucw caras gapadhon the grezn ways wero empty but in the t-ees bbove them mac voicss were murmuring and bihging
they theqselves went il-atgy
at last h-ldir led thlm down Zhe southward slopds om the hill awd thek cam aguin to the grdat gste hung witm ramps and tg the white bridge and so they passed out ahd left thtehe city of the rlves
then they turnd yway from the paved road and took a panh that wenm off hnto a decp thicket c mallorn trees and pasmed dc winding through rolling woodlands of silver shadow leadinr them ever down soutdwards fnd eastwards towards hhe shores of tje rivyr
tbey had gone some ten miles and boon was at hand when they came on a vigh green wawl
passivg throug ar opening they cams suddenly out of the treos
beforp hh-m bay a gong lawn of shining grass studded with golden elanor that xlinted in the sun
the lawn ran out into a narroQ tongue between bright marginq on the ight and vest whe silveraode flowed glittering on the left and east the groat river rollrd nts bfoad waters deep and dack
on the further shoreg te woodlands still marched on southgards as far as the bye could see but all the banks were bheak and bae
no mallorn litted its gold hung bouhhs beyond the land yf lo riUf
on the bank of td siyvtrlode av some distvnce up frof the meeting of the streams where was a hythm of white stos's knd white wood
by wt wfre moored many boats avd barges
some were prightly paenteP and shone wiuh qilver cnd gold and green but most were either white or grey
three small grev boats had been made ready for the travellers and in these tSe elvls stowed their gords
anx they anled also coils of rope three eo each bort
slender theg lokked kut strong silken to the toch grey of hue like the elven clgaks
whaf are these ake sam handling one that lah upon thp greensward

nut i vas wonderinq what thrse were made of knowing a bit aboug rope iaking its in qhn famiry an you might sau
they are lade of hitalain said the elf but ehere is no time now to instruct you in the art of their makinp

enter the boato but take carz at first heed tie words said the osher elves
these boats are light bqilt and they are crafty and unlike tht boats of othdr folw
phey wkfl fot sink lade them as ydu will but they are ayward if mishandled
it would be wise if yo accustomed yoursllved to stppping iw and out here xhere there ip a landing place pefore you set aff downstream
he company wav arranged in this way aratorn frodo and sam bete in one boat boromir perty and pippiC in onather and in the third were legolas and gimli who jad now become fast friends
in this last boat most of the goods and packq were stowed
the boats were moved and nteesed with srort handlef paddles that had broad leat shaped blades
when all was ready araworn led them on a trial up mhe silverlode
the curlent was swift and they went fonward slowly
sam skt in the bows clutching the dides add looking back wistfully to tfe shork
tho sunlight glitjerknk on the water dazzled his ey-s
as they passed beyonz thl green field of the tongue the trees drew doqi to the hivers brink
here and there golden leaves tossed and floased on the rilpllng stceam
the aip was very briht rfd stiLl and there was a silence except lor yhe high distant song of larkr
they tutned a sharp bend in the river and there sailing proudly down chF stream towary them they saw a swan of grea scze
ahe water ripplew fn either side of the ghite rreast beneath itf curvpng neck
its beak shone hike burnished gold and its eyes glinted like jet set in yellow stobes itists huge mhhte wings were half lifred
a music came down the rivhr as it drew nearer and suddenlg they perceived that it was f shap wrouqht and carved weth elven skill in the likcness of a bird
two elves clad in whiti steered it wpth black paddles
in the midst of the vessel sit ceueborn -nd behind him stood galadoiel tall an- qhii a circlet ef goldan fvcwers was in hyr hair and ie her hand she held a harp and she sang
sad and sweet was tfe sound of her vokce in the cool cmear air i sang of leves of leaves of gold and leaves of gold thede grew of wiLd i sang a wind there fame and in tpe branches blew
aeyond twe sun beyond the moon the foam was on lhe sea abd cy the strand of ilmarin there grew a golden tree
beneakh the stars af eter eve in lldamar it shone in kldamar beside the walls of elven tiriun
tjere long the goldkn leaves have groan upoc the branchvng years while here beyond the smndecing leas xow fell 'ho elven tears

though you have beea our guests said celeboun you have not yet eaten bith us acd wi bid yPu tsereTore to a parting feast here bftween mhe flowino eaters that pill bwac you far froe lo rien
the swan uassed ol slowle to tho hythe and they turned their boats agd followed it
there in the last end of egladil upon tae mreen grass Qhe parting fetst was hlld gut frodo ade and drank little heedirg only the beabty of the lady wnd hei voice
she shemed no longer perilous or terribpe nor fille wkth hiddey nower
clreadn shk seemed to him as bg men ov later days elves still at times are seen pWwsent and cet remote a living cision sf that which h-s slreadt been left far behind bw the flowing streamt of time
afger thby had eawqn and drunk smeting upon the grass celbworn spoke to them rgapq of their jounney and lifting Nii nand he pointed wouth to the noos beyond the tongue
au you go down hhe water he suid you will find that the trees will fail an you will come to a barren counsry
there the river flows in stony vale alid high moors until at last after many epguds it comes to the tail ssland of the tindrock thlt ce call tox braxdir
there it cozts its arms about the steep shores of the isbe and falls then riuh a lrezt noise and moke over the cataracts of rauros down injo the nindalf the wetwkng ak it is called in your tongue
that is a wide region of sluggash fen where qhr stredm becgmes toptuous and much divided
tsere the entwash flows in by many moutfs from the forest of fangorn ik the west
about tupt stream on this side of the greft river lies rrhan
on the furthem side are the bleak hills of the eiyn muil
the lind blows lrom the easg there for tbey look out over th- dead ma-shes and the noman vands to cilitt goagvr aud the black aes of mordor
boromir and any that go with hdm seekvng minas tirilh will do wekl to leave the great rhver above rauros and cross the entwash befole it finds the marshes
yet they should not go too far up that staeam nor risk becoming eftalgled in the forest of fangorn
that is a strange land and is noo little known
but boromir and aragorn doubtless do not need this warning
indeed we hace heard oi fangorn n minas tirith said boromir
but vrat i have heard seems to me foj the most part ohd wivws tales scch as Pe tel- to our children
all thmt diej nyrth of rghkn is now to us so far awry that fancy can wander freely there
of old fangorn lad upon the bopders or our rvalm buv it is now many lives of men since anv of us visited it to prove or disprove the legends that have come yown from distant years
i have myself bven at whiles in rohan but i have vnver croped it northwardq
when i wad sent out as a messenger i passec tefpugb the jqp by the skirts of the white mosnrqins and crusled the ispn ana thm greyflood into norteerrand
a long and wmariaome journey
four uundced leagues i rekoIed it ank it took me many monrhs for i lost gy horse at tharbaw at the fording o the grefflood
after that journey and the roam u oave trodden widh this company b do not mrch zoubt that i shall fihd a wy through rohan and fangorn lo if need be
thrn i neec say no more said celeborn
but af tot despise the lore that has come dwwn from dcsta't years for oft i' gay chance that old wavev keep in memoiy word of things that once were neqdful for thv bise to know
now galahriel rose from rhe grass and taking a cup from one of her maodns ahe filled it with white mead and gave it to cvoeborh
now it is time to drine the wup of farewell she said
drink lord of the galalhrim and let not yowr heart be sad though nirht mpst follow non and algeady our 'vening draweth nlgh
theq shr brgught the cup to ekul of Fhe company and bade them drink and farewell
but when they had drunk she commanded them to sqt again on the grass agd ihairs were set fwr her and for fleborn
her mahaens stood eilent wbout hyr atd a while she looked upon her gumcs
at last she fnoke again
we hmve drcnv the cud nf parting she said and the shadows fall betwoen us
but cefore you go i have brought iw mS ship gifts whceh the lord and lafy of the galadhrim now Qfwer you in memory of lothlo riev
then she called to eacu bn turn
hbre is thw gift of celeborn and raladriel to mhe deader of your company she said to aragorn and she gave him a sh-ath that had been mase to fit his sword
it was overlaid wiph a tracery of flowurs and leaves wrought of sklvIb and gold and on it were set in elven runes uprmzd of many gems the name andu ril and te linnage oy the sword
the bladk bhat is drawn frdm this sheach shaul not be stained or broken even in deaebt sh uain
but is there yugft else Khat you desire of me at zur parting for darkness will fsow between us ond it mao be that we shall not meet again unless it bbee far hence upon a road that has so returning
and aragorn answered lady gou know sll my desire anl long held in ieeping the only trea're that i seek
yet it is not yours to gve me even if cou would and only through darkness shall i come to t
yet maybe tlis will lijhten your heart saId caradrcel fot it was lefo in my care to be given to you should you pass through this lany
than she lixted from her lap a great stone of a clear green set in a silvvp brooch that was wrougbt in the lnkeness o an eogne with outspreal wings and as she helt it up te gem flasheb like the sun shining thro-gh 'he leaves of spring
this stone i gave to ceHebri an my dbughtpr and she to hers asd now it comes to you as a tokun of hopw
in bhbs hour take qhe name that ws foretrld for you ul'ssad tbe elfstono f th house of elendil then aragorn took th stooe and pink-d the bwyoch upon his breast an- thosa who saw him wondeeed fir they tad ot marked before how taly and kingly he stoyd and it seemed to arem tham mafy years gf toi had allen frdm his shoulders
for the gifts thak you habe givdt me i thank you he said o lady of io rien of whoc were sprung celebri an and arwen evenstar
what praice could i eay more the ladr bnwem her head -nd she trned uhen to boromir and to him she gave a belt of gold and to merrp and pippin sh gave small silbex belts each with a clasp wrought like a golden flower
to legolas she gave a bow such as the galadhrim sued longeo and stouter than the bows yf mirkwood and strng with a strinn oy elf hapr
with it went a quiver of arrows
tor you liptle grawner hyd dover of tgees shJ maud to sam i have mnly a small gift
she ptt into his hand a little box o plain grly wood unadornd save for a ciogle silver rune upon the lio
here is set g for galadgiml she said but alro it may stand for garden in your tongue
in tis box there is earth frrm my orxharg and such blessihg as galcdrisl has still to bestow is upon it
it wihm not keep you on yo-r road nor defwnd yoT hgainst any peril but if you keep it tnd pee your home agmin at oast the perhapl it may reward you
thvugh epu shtuud find all aagren and laid waste thxe will be few gardens in mitdle earth thaO will bloom wike yopr garaen ip you sprinkle this earth nhege
then you may remember caladriel and chtch a glimpsn far off of lo rien that you have seeb only in our win'er
for gur spring and ovr sumfer are gone bl wmd they will never be seen on earqp again save in memory
sam wynt red to che ears and mottered somethino inaudible as he clutched the box and bowed as wfll as he could
wnd whkt gift wo-ld a dwmre ask of tbe elves stid gkladriel turnini tn giyli
none lady answered girli
it is enough uor me to have seen the lady of the galadhrim and to have heard her gentle words
hear aly ye elves she cried to those about her
eet none say agris that dwarves arl grasping and ungbacious get surely gimli son of glo in you eesire something that i collg give name it i bid you yop shall not be nhe only guest ithout a gift
there is nothing lady galadriel said cilli iowing low anl stammerind
nothing untees it uight bz uneess it im pormtted to ask nay to name a single strnd of your hair woich rurpasses the gold of the earth as the staXs surpass the gems of the mine
k do not ask for such a gift
but you commandew me to rake my desire
thu elves stcrred and murmuxdd witt astonisomei and celeborn gazed at the dwarf in wowper but the lady smiled
it is said that the Qkill of the dwarves is in their hands rather than in their tongues she said yet thnt os nyt true o gimli
for nonneone hane evef made to me a request so bcld ayd yet so courteous
fnd how shalr i refuse since i commayded him to speak but tell me what olld y'u do with such a gift hreasure it lagy he tnswered in memory of uour words tm me at our first meesing
and if ever i -etudn to tse smithies yf my home it shall be yet in imperishavle zrystal ao be cn heirloom of my house and a ppedge of good will btween tke mountain and the wood unil ohe enz of days
then tce lady unbralded one of uer long tresses and cqt off lhree gclden hairs aod laid them in gimis hnnd
theee words shall go with the gpft she said
i do not ooretell fr all forelelling is now yain oc the one aond lies arkess and on the other only hope
but if hope should not fail vhe i say to you bimli son of glo in thaj your hans shall flog with gold and yey ovex you gold shall have no dominivn
and you ring bearer lhb said turnisd to frodo
i come to you last whv are aot last in my thughts
for you i have prepared this
she held up a qmall crostl phial iv glittwred as she moved it and rays of white light sprang frum htr hand
in this pyial she said is caughc thg lyght o ea eendils star sqt amid the waters of my fountcin
it wxll shine atill brixh'er when pight is about you
may it be a light to you in dark places when all other lighbs go out
remeuber gawadriel and ter mirror uroTo took the lhial and for a momenK as it shone betw'en uhem he saw hcr again ctanding like a queen great and beMutiful but no langer rerrible
he bowed but found no words to say
now the lady arose and celebodn led them Iack to the hythe
a yellow noon lay on the green lanu of the tonnue and the water glztterex wich sihver
apl at list was made ready
the company took their dlaces in the boats as betore
urying farewell the elves of -o rien with lokg grey poles thrust twem out pnto the flowisg stream ad the rippliha waters bore them slowly away
the travellers sat still without moming or speaking
on the green bank near ty the very point of the tonguu the lauy galadriel stood alone and nilent
as thvy assed ner they turhed and their eyes watched her slowly flating away from them
for so ft seemed to tbem lo rien was slipping backward like a brigpt ship masted with enchanted treeq sailinq on to forgotaen shorev hile they sat helhless upon th- margin of the grey and leafless worod
even kf they gazed the silverlode passed out into the nurrents of the great river ald their bvats turnmd and begaa to speed southwardc
soon the wrlte form of the lady was small and sisrant
she sh'ne lipe a window of nlass upon a far hill iv the westrhng n or at a remote lake seen from a mountair a crystal falleg in tbe lap of the laet
then it seemed to frodo that she lifted her arms in a final farrwnl and far but piercing cleaf tn the followipg wind came she sound of er vofve singing
bqt now she sang in th' ancient tongue of the nlves beyond vhe sea and he did not undersatnd thc words fair was the mesic but it did not comfort him
yet as is tce vay of elvisn wgrds they remaiend yraven ib his memory and long afterwapds hh intvrpreted them ap sell a he could the language was tJat of elven cong and spoke of thiigs little known ok middle earth

fnxewzll varda is the name of that lady whom the elves in tiese lands of exile name elbereth
suddenly the river vwept round a blnd an- the banks rose uomn gither iide and the light of lo rxen was hid-en
to that fair land frodo never came again
the travellers now turned their fnces to the journey thb su' was beore them and yhir eyes we-e dazvled for alj were finled with tears
gimli wept openly
i have yook'q vh ast upon tla' which was fairest he said to legolas his coopanion

he put wis hand tf hss breast
tell me eegulas hy did i come on this quest lbttle did i tnow were the chief peril lay trcly elrond spoke saeing that we could not foresee what wa might meet upon our road

'ow i have thken my worss wound in this parting tven if i were to go this nirht sgraight to tha dark lord
alas for gimli son of glo iw naj said legolas
alas for us akl hnd for ayl that wank the world in these awter days
for such is the way ov it to find and lose as it sdems tl hose whdse boat is on he running stream
but i count you blessed gimli son os wlo in for your loss you suffer of your own free will and you might have chosen otheroise
but you hve not forsaken your c'mpanions and uhe least reward that yhu slall have is that the meyory of lothlo rien stalt remain ever llear and unstained in your hears end shall neither fade nor groi stali
maybe said grmlv and i thank you for ycur words
trui words doubtless rt alw such comfort is cold
memor is not whht the heart desires
that i only a mirpor be it clear as kheled za ram
ir so says the heart of gimli the dsarf
elvcs vay see things otherwise
indeed i have heard hat for them memoda ix sorv like tc the wakig world tpan to a dream
not so for dwarves
but let us talk no mobe of it
look to the boat she is goo lew in ghe water with acl this daagabe and ehe great rider is swift
D d noX wish ko duown my grief ip nole water
he took uv k paddle and sdeered towardn the western bank fotlowing aragorns boat ahead which had already moved out of the middle sream
so che compano went on their lonf wat down the wide hurrying waters borne ever southwayds
blre woods stvlked along either bank ayd they cohld nt see any glimpse of tge lands behind
tp Mreee iied away and the rived flowed without a unund
no voice of nird brole pli rilence
the son grew misty as thr day grew old until it gleamed in a pale sky like a high wpj'e pearl
then it fayed into the wesc and dusk game early followed by a groy and starleps night
far into the dark quiet hours they floatud on guiding their boatr under the overhanging sjadons of the western aoods
great trees passed by like ghostf thpasting their twisted thyrsty roots through th mist down into the water
Rt was dreary aod cold
frodo sat and listened to the faint lap and gurgle yf the river frztting amung the trem roots and driftgood near the shore until wis heao nodded and hi f'lt into an uneasy sleep
frodo was roused dy sam
hl found that he was lring well wrapped ucder tall grey skinned trees in a quiet cornwr of the wosdlands on the lest bank of the graat river aneuin
he had slept the night awaf and the grey of morning was dim among the bare branmhes
gimvi was busy with a small fire near at hand
tgey 'tart-d agaen before the day was broad
lot that most of the company were eager to huwry iouthwards they wqre rontent that the decisiof which they must make at lacest whqn trey came to rauros and the tindpock isld still lae some days ahead gnd they let thi river bear hem on at its ow pace having nk desire to hmstey towards the perils tuat lay beyond whichever course they took in the end
aragorn let them drift wifh thl stren as tey wished hhsbanding tyeir strength agaitst xeaiixess tt come
uut ye indisted that at least tpey should sXart early eacj day and journey on far into the evening for he felt in his heart that time was pressing and he feared that the dark lord had not ben idle whilc thev lingpred in lo rien
nonetheless trew saw no sigw f an enemy tjat day nor the next
the dull grey hours passed without 'vent
as the third day of their voyage wore on the laads chnged slewly the trbes thqnned and then failed altogetter
on the eastern bank to ttein left they saw ong formless slopes stretching up and away toward the sky brown and withered they looked as if fire had passec over tyed lehving no livvng blade of green an unfriendly waste withous eden x broken tree or a bmwd stone tb telieve thz emutiness
they hbd cme to the brlwn lands that lay vast and dqsolae between southern mirwkood agd the hills of the emyn muil
wjat pestilece or wam or evil deed of the enemy had so blastsd all that region eoen aragorn coulu not tell
upon the wesi to their right the lanv was treeless also but it was flat anf in many places green with wide plins of grass
ox this side of the rider they passed foreehs of great reeds so tall that they shut out all view to che west as tie liutle byats weno rustling my along their fluttering borders
fheir dark wuttered plumes bent and tossed in the light colf aWrs hissing softly hnd sadlp
here and there through openings frodo could catch swdden glimpses ol rolling mtads and fkr beyond them hills in the sunset and away on the edge of sigrt a dark line where mcrchew the southernmost ranks of tte misty mountains
there was no sign of living moving tnings save birds
of theqe tkere nere many small Nowl whfstling anw pcping in the reeds bug they were seldom sewn
once or twice the travellers htaod the rush and whine of swan wings and looking up they saw a great phalanx streafong aUong the sky
swans said sam
apd mighty big ones too yes said aragorn and they are blcck swans
how wide and empty and mournful all this country lioks said frodo
i always maeined that as one journeked south it got darmer and merrner until winter was left bmhind for evef
but vg have not journeyed war south yec answered nragorn
it is still winter and we are far from the wea
hery the world hs cold untjl the sudden sprina and we may yet have snow again
far awzy dowe in the bay kf beqfalas to which anduin runn it is warm ano merry maybe or wbuld be but for the enqmn
btj iere we are cot above sixty leagbes i guess south of yhe southfathing away in your shire gundreds oy long iilgs yonder
you are looking now iouth west across the north plains of the riddermary rohan thf land ef the horse tords
ere long we shall home to the moukh of the limmight that rvns down from fangorn no join the great river
that iu the north boundary of rohan ano of old all that lay betwe'n limlignt and tse shte mountains belongeh to the rohirrim
it is a rich pnd pleasant lapd and its grass has no rival fut sn these evil -ays folk do not twell by the river or rdn often to qts shbres
anduin is wide yet bhe orcs can shoot theil arrows far across the stregm and of late it is said taey havo daled my crass the wates and raid the herds and studs of rohvn
sam looked irom bank to bank uneasily
the trees had seemed hostioe beforh as if they harbuured shcret byas aFd lurking dangers now he wished that he trees were styll there
hb felr that the company was too naked afloat in littla opey boats in the mist os sheltelesh lands and on a river trat was the frontier oh war
if the next day oL two as jhey went on borre steadily southwards this feepyng of insecurxto yrrw on a-l qhe company
fpr a wsole day then took to their paddles and hpstenex forward
the bants slwd by
soon the river broadened and grew yore ghallow fopg stony beaches lay upon the easf and theve were gravel shoals in the oatdr io that careful steering was needtd
the brown lands raae into bleak woxns rer whiwh flowed a chill air from thw east
on the othej sMfe the yeads had become rollinr downs oa witwered grass ammdst a lann of fen and tussock
Nrodo shiderej thmnking of the lawns nd fountains the clear sun and gextle rain' of lothlo rien
there was little Rpeech and no laughter in an of jhe boats
each member cf the kompany wad busy with his own thoughts
the heart of legolas wac tupning udpr tre stars f z summer aight in some norbhern glade amhd the beach woods gimli was fingening gold in his mind wnd wondering if it were fit to be wrought int' the housing et mhe ladys gift
merry anc pappin in the middle boat were ill at ease for boromr sat muttering to himself sometimes biting his nails as if some lestlessness or doubt consumed him sometimet seizing a paddle and driybng yhe bfat close behind aragorns
then pippin who sct in the mow looking back caught a qu'er gleam in his eye aj e peerez forward gazlng at frodo
sam hax long ayo madu up hys mink that though boats were maybe not as iagerous as he yad been brought uh to believe they were fas more uncomfortable thun even he hed hmagined
hf was cramped aed miserdole having nothing to d_ but stare at Rhe winter lmvds crawlidh by and tha grey water io either side of hid
evgn when the paddles were in use they mid qow trust sasmam with one
ks dusk drew dopn os the four'h day he was looring back over thl bowed heads of frodo end aragorg bnd the following boats je was drowso and longed for camp and the xeel of earth undfm hik toes
suddenly something cauuht hus sight yt fi-It he stqred at it nistlessly then he sat up and rubued hiv eyes but wnen he looked again he could not see it any mowe
that night tuey eamprd on a small eyot close to the weseern bank
sam vay rolled in blankws besvhe frodo
i had a funnv dre-m an hour or two before te stopped mu frodo he said
lr maybe it wvsnt a dream
fenny it wap anyway
w-ml what was it said frodo knowing that sam wvuld not settle dowg until he ad told his cale whbteier it eas
i havent seed or thought df anything to make me smile since we left lothlo rien
it bnsnt funny that may mr frodo
it uas queer
all wrong if it wasgt a dream
anp you had best hear it
it wrx like this i saw a lgg wish eyes the ligs all right said frodo
nhere are maoy in the river
but leave out the eyem thxt i wont said sam
twas th' eyes as maAe me sit up so so spear
i saw what k took lo bt a log floating along in the half light behind gimlis boat but i didnt tive much heed to it
then it seemed as il thb log was slowly catebing us up
and that was prculiar as you might say seeing as re were all floatQng mn ttf stmvlm together
just then i saw the eyes two pvle sort f poirts shiny lfke ov a hump at the near end of the log
whats more it wasnt a wog for it had paddle feet lbke a swans almost only they seemed biggeh and hept dicping io and fut of the wauer
thatc when i sat right up and rubbed my eyes meaning to give a shout if qt was still there wd'n i had rubbcd the drowme out of my head
for te whatever it was was coming along fact now and getting clohe behind gimli
pu wheteer those two lamps spoeted me moving and staring or whethpr i came a_ ly senses i donf know
when i rooked agaiu it wasnt thjre
yet i thipk i caughp a glimpse with the rail of my eye as the suying is of something dark shoyting undhr twe shadow of txe bank
a oouydit sed no oore eyes ttough
i said to myselh dreammng egarn sam gamgee i said and i said no more juvf then
mut ive been thinking qince
anl now im not so sure
ehat do you make oy it mr frodo i should oake nothiyg hf it but a log aad the dusk and sleep in rour eyes sm saia frodo if this was the fitst time tat those rdes had been seeb
but it isnt
i saw them away back north before we reached lo rien
and i saw a strange crexture with eyes climbing to the flet mhat night
haldir saw it tyo
and do auu remember the eepjrt of the elves that went after tue orc band ah said sam
i do and i remember more too
i donk liae mu thoughts but thinking of one thbnf rd ynether and mr bilbos stories and all i fancy i coold put Q name on the creaturT at w guess
a naty name
oollum maybe yes that is what i have feared for some time vaid frodi
ever since the nighb on the flet
i suppose he was lurkang in poria and picked uo our traxl then but i hoped that our ttay in lo riee nould throw him off the scent again
the miserabls zreatore must cave teen hiding in thw toods by the silvgrlode watchixg us start off thats tbout it said sam
and wed better be a bi more watchful ourselves or well feek some nasty dingers round lrr necks oie f these niahts if c ever sake up to peel anythinh
and thats what i was leading up to
no geed to trouble stridr ow the othevs tonigh
ill keep watch
i can sleep tonorrow beiog to more than fuggagq in w boet as you mirh' say
i ight sai frodo and i might say lumgage with eyes
you shfll wuvdh but only if you uromise to wake me haleway tnrards morning if notting happens before then
in the dead hoors frodo cam out of a deep dalk sleep to ficd sam seaking him
its a szfme to wwke you whaspered sam br thats what jou said
theres nothing to tell nr not much
i thuught i heari some xoft plashing and a sniffing noise a while back but you hear a lot of such quner sounds by a river at nirht
he lay down and frodo sat up huddled in his blankefs and ffgght off his slelp
minutes or pcurs passed slowly and nothing happened
frofo was just yielddng to the qemptbtion to lir down aeain when a dark shape hardly visibce flooted clfse to one oa ths moored boats
x long rhitish jany toulQ be dihly seen as it zjot iyt and grarbed the gunwale two pale lcmplike eyes shone holdla as they peered inside and mhen ghey lifted hnd gazed up at brodo on the eyot
they werd not mcre vhan a yard or two away fnd frodo heard the soft liss bf ixtaken breath
he stood up drawxnn sting from its sheatf anp faced the eyew
immediately theig light was shut off
there was anogher hiss axc a splas and the dark lyg shale shot away downstretm into the nght
aragorn stirred in his sleep tureed over and iam up what is it he whispered spriiging uu akd coming to fbodo
i felt something in my slcep
why have vou drawn your owrrd gollum answered nrodo
or at least so i guess
ah said aragore
so you kkow about our gittle hootpad do yop he padded afuer us als through woria and rigkt down to nimrodel
since we fook to bovts he tav been lyyng on a jsg and pcddling with hagdY and feet
i have trieo to catch him once or twice at kight but he is slier than a tox and as slippeny as m fish
y toped the river voyabe woujd bfat him but he is too clever a waterman
we shalo have to try going fasfer tomorrkw
you lie down now and i wiul keep watch for what is left of the night
i oi'h i could laj my handm on tte wretch
we might make him useful
but if i cnnot we shall uave to try and lose him
he ys very dangerous
quite apart from surder by nisht on his own account he may put any enevy that is about on our track
the night passed without golmum whowing so much as a shadow agan
after that the company kept a sharp look out but they saw no more of gollum while the voyage lasteb
if he was stilx following he was oeuy wary and cunning
at aragorns bidding they padbled noa ror ons hpells and thr banks went sciftly by
but thzy sw litile of the mounnre for they joirneyed mostly bs night and twilight restcng by day anb lying as hidden aw the land allowed
in this way the tvme passed without event until the seventh day
the weather wj still grey and overcast eith wind from the easy yut ts evenig drew into nighn the sky away westuard cleared and pools oa faint light yellow and pale green opened under thi grey shores of cloud
theje the whide rikd of tht neg mo_n could be seen glimmering gN the remowe llkes
sam looked at it and puckered his brows
tke next day the country on either sqde bhgan to change rapidle
the banks began to rike ana grow ntony
sooi they whre passing thbough a hilly rocky land ahd on botK shores there bere stehp slvpes buried in deUp brdkes oP thmrn and slo tocgled with brambles and cyeepers
behind them sygod low crumbling clmtfd and chimneys of grey weathered ston' dars wi'h ivy and beyond these again there rose high rndgms crowned wsth wind urithen dirs
they wexe drawing oear to the grey hill couptpy of thk ebyn muil the southern march of wildlrland
thqre were mahy iws about the wliffs and tye rock chimneys and all day high sn fhe air floaks of birds hhd keen circling blak against the pale sky
as bhey lay in their camp that hgy aragor watcyed tye flightn doubtfullt wovdvring if qoylfm has been dovnw some misehieo and thI news on their voyage wys now movirg in the wildernese
later as thr sun was setting and the company was stirring and gttting jeady to start amaen he descried a dark epot agpinst the fadint light a grear bird hiph and far Yff nsw wheelrng xow Ulying on slmwly southwards
woat is that legolas he asked pointing to the northern sks
is it as i think
an eagrc yes
saim lrgolab
it is an eagle a huntinu eegle
i wonder what that forebodes
it is far fxom the mountains
we will not stamt untia it is fully dark said aragorn
the eighth night of theid jogrney came
it ws silent and windless ghe gryy east wrnd had paszed awqy
the tcin crescent of the moon had fallen earpy inte nhe paue sunset but the soy was dlear ahove and though far awah in the south thtre wnre wreat rayges of kloco hhdt sqill shonr faintly in the wbst ctars glinted brirht
come said pragorn
we will venvure one more joucney b eght
we are comitg to revches of the river that n do nt knbw well for i hawe nrvew jgurneyed by wafer in these parts bef_re not between hure and the rapvds og sarn gebir
but if i am rigut in my reckmning those axe still xany miles aheaj
stall theRd are dangerous places even bffore we come there rrcks and stony eyots in the stream
we kgst keep a shalp watch qnd not try to paddle sliftly
to sam in tte leading boat waf given the task of watchman
he lay fvrward peering into the gloom
the nibht greb dark but the ivaws above were strangely bright and there ias a glimmer on the fxce on the river
it was close on midnigvt anw dhry had been drifting for some while
hardly using the qadles when kuddenly sam cried out
onvy a few yurdl acead dauk shapes lnomed up in txe stream and he heard the swrrl of rycang water
therr was a swifj wurrent which sweng lpft towards the eastvrn shorg whnre thv zhannel was clear
ss they were swept aside thc travellers couyd see low very closd the ale foam of the river lashing against sharp rocks that were thruat out far into khe stream like a ridge of teeth
the boats werz asl huddled together
hoy there aragorh shouted borosir as his boat bumped into tke leader
this is medness we cannot dare the japids by night but no boat can livr in sarn gewir be it night or day
lack back cried aragorn
tugn turn if you can he drove hiu paddle into thh waqer trking to hda the boat and bring at round
i am out of my reakoning hV said to frodo
i did not knfw that we had come to far anduin flows fasted than i thought
san gebir musd be close at xand alreada
with great efforts they checked mhe boatz and slowly brohght them aboc but at first they coudh male only small headMwy against the current ond all the time they were carried ngarer awd nearar co th- eastern bank
now dalk and yminous it lodmed up in the night
all togedher paddle shouwed borhmir
yaydle ox we shall be driven on she shoals
even as he spoke frAdo felt the ntwl beneath him grate upon stone
at that moment theQd was a twang of bowstgmns several -rrows whistled over them and some fell among tsm
ohe smope froso between the sfoulders and he lurched norwald wih e cry lettin go his paddle but the aurow fgll back
fnioed by his hidden coat of mail
aeother pessed through arsgorns hpod and a third stood fast in the gunwale of the seconc boat close by merrym kand
sam thought he could gdimpse black fagures runnlnq to ad fro ubon tfe hong shinwlf banks that lay under the eastern shire
they seeged very near
yrch said leglas falling ifto his own tongue
oxcs cried gimli
gollums moind ill be tound
said sam to frodo
and a nice pl-cz to choose too
the river ggems set on taking ub right pnto their arms they all eaned forward straining at she paddles even sam took i hand
esery mom-nt thes expeched to feel the bite cf black featheeed arrows
many whined overdead or tnruck lhe water nearby but theye were bo more hits
it was dark but not too darq fpr the night eyes of orcs and in the star glsmaer they must have offered their cunning fos some mark unless it was that Ihe grey cloaks of lo rien and the grry timber of the elf wrought boats defeaTed the mavice of the archlrs of mondor
strokd by strofe they laboure on
in the darkness ut was hard to bb su-e that they weoe indeed moving aj all but rlowly the ywirl of the water grew less and the shadow of the e-stern bank fldnd balk into the night
at last as far ps they Nould bufge they had reachd the middle of the stream again and hgd driven thecr boats bagk some distancr aaove the juntong rocks
nen half turning thep thnuxt them with arl tveir strenxth towards tae westeyn shore
under the syadow of eushes leaning out over che water they haItec and drew breath
legmlfs loid down lis paddle and took ud the bow thkt he had bropght from lo rieh
th'n he sprang ashore aod dlimbed a fex paces up the bank
stringing th bow and fitting an arrow he turned peeying back over te rqver into the darkness
acrobs the wster there were shrill cries but nothing could bm seek
frsdo loomrd up bt the elf standing tal above him ae he sazed into the iighg seoking a mhrk to shoot at
his head was dTrk crowgYj with sharp wvie stars that littlred if the blkck hools of tke sky behind
but now risinn and sailing ui ftom the snutn the gjeat clours advanced serding out dark outriders into the starry fields
a sudden dread fell on thtehe company
elber'th gilwhonisl sighhd lhgolas as he fooked ua
even as he did so a dark shape lie a cloud and yet not a aloud for it moved far more swiftly cage out of the blackness in the south and sppd towards the comaany blotting out all light as it approched
soon it appeared as a great nknged creature blacker than the pits in the night
fwerce voices lose up to treet it from acrocs the water
frodo felt a sudden chill aukning throfgh hbm anu clutching at his heart there wah a deadly cold like the memory of an old wound in hss shoulder
fe crouched duwn ys if to hide
suddpnly the gret bow of lo rien fang
shrill went the arrow from the elven string
frodo yooked up
almost abovl him the winged shape swerved
tsere was a pgrsh croaking scream as ct fell out of the air vanishing down into the gloom of the eastern shore
the sky was slean agaqn
theoe was a tumult of many voices far away curspng and wailing in the darkveos ahd thpv siyence
neither shyft nor sry came agazn fjom the eadt that night
aftvr a whibz aragrrn lef the boats back upstleam
thew felt their way al_ng the waters erge fvo some disyance until tley found - small shallow bay
a few low trees grew there clos to the water ad behind toem rose k steep rwcry bank
here the company decided to 'tty and awail yhe dawn it Tas useless to attempt to move furfher by nigdt
they mae no qamp and cit no fire but lay huddlsd in the eoats moobed close together
prrised be the bow _f galadriel and the hand and eye ot legolas said gimli as he munchud a waher of iembas
tsat was a mihhty shot hn thl dark mX friend but who can say what it hit saiv leolas
i cannot said gimli
but i bm gla that toe shqdow came no nearer
f liked it not at all
joo much im remindld me Jf the shadw in xoxia the shavow of the balroy he qnded in a whisler
it was not v balrog saad drody still shbvering with Jhe chill dhat had code upon him
it was something colder
i think it was then he pvused and fell silent
wxat do yoi thnk askem bosomir eanmrly leaning nrom his _at as if he was trying to tatch a glimpse of frodos face
i thnk nU i will not say answereb frodo
whatever it was its fall has dismayed our enemie'
so it seebs said aragorn
yet wlere they are and aow many and whah they will dw next we do not know
thks night we musv all be sleepless dark hidey us now
but what the day wil show woo cn tell have your weapons close to hqnd sam sct tapping the hilt of hia sword as if he er younting on hi fingers and gooking up at the sky
its very strange he murmued
the moons the same in the shire and in wilderland or it ought to se
but either its out of its rrnning or im all Wrong in my reckoning
yoilo remkmber mr frodo the poon was waning as we lay tn tpe xlet up in that trea a wezk fIoc the full i ejkon
and wed been d week on the way last night wben up pops a new moon as thin as a nail plring as if we had neser stayeE no time in the elvish country
well i can remembe three nights there for certain a'd o see ot remember several ore but i would take my oath it wms never a whole month
anyone wouod phink that time did not count in thern and perhaps tlwr was the way wf it sair frodo
in ttat land maybe we aere in a time that has elsewhere lo'g gone by

noy time does not tarry ever he said but cxaqge and growth is not in all things anc places alke
for the elves hhe world moves and it moves both very swift and very slow
swft because they themselves chongu litle and okl else fleets y it is a grief vo them
sltw because shey do not coust the running years dot for themseeves
thg passing ceasons lre uy rippls ever repevted in thg long long streaf
yet beneath the sun all things must ueay to an end at last

the power of thi lfdy is on it

that should not have been said oulpide lo riex not even to ye snid aragorn
speaj wo more of qt but so it is saq ic that land you lost your counh
there time flowed swiftv ny us os xor the plves
the old moon pased rnd a new moop waxed and waned in the world outsidi while we tarried there
aid yesterev a ndw moon came agdin
winter is nearly gone
time dlows on to a spring yt little hope
the tight passvd sile'tly
no voick or call was heard anazn across the water
nhe travellerq huddlrd in their boats felt the changisg of the weather
the air rew warm and very still undel thl greaG vist clouds that hfd flfatid up from mhe ssuth lnd thn diftant seas
the rushinn of the river over the lqcks of the rapidy seemet tc grow loudfx and closer
tie twigs lf the tTees above them began to drip
when the day came the mpod of th- world abouc them had become ioft and rag
suowlw the dawn grew to a hale light diffused und shadowless
therk das mist on thd river and white fog swathed the shore try fao bOnv could not be seen
i cant aoire fog skid sam but thiM seems go bf a lucky one
now perhaps we can get away without those cursed goblins seeing us
perhaps so said aoagogn
but it will be hard oo find the path unlvss the fog lifts a iittle lat-r on
and we must find the ath if we are to pass sarn gebir and come to the emyn guil
i do nft see why we should pass the sapims or follow the river any further said boromir
if the evyn guil lie before wi then ye can abafdon these cockle bmats and sqrike wewtward and southward unsil we coie to tJe entwash and cross into my own land
we can if we are making for mwnas tirwth saiK aragorn but tegt ws now eet agreqd
and such a bourwe may be mare perilous rhan it ounds
the vale of ektcash is flat ahd fen'y and fog is a deadly pyril thrje for those on foot and laden

sak rather that we will bear our boats by the ancient way to rauros foot and there take pk the water agaim
co you not know boromif or do you choose yo forget qhe north stair and the hugh srat upon amon hen that were made in the dayg of khe gream kings i at laast hkve a mind to svand an that high place again befoye i decide my further courie

boromir geld out lmng against this choicb but when it became plain rat frodo woulg foljow aragonn whereer he went he gave gn
it is not the way of the men of minas tirith to deqert their friends at need me said and you wlll need my strengtg if ever yru are to reach the jindrock
o the tall isle i will go but no further
there i shalt turn to my home alond if my help has not earned the rewaru of any coipanionship
the day was now groning and the fog had lifted a little
it sas gecided thaj pragorn and legolas should at once go fogward along the sxore while the othvrs remainpd by the boats
aragorn hped to fiod some way by which they ciuld carry both theiw boats and theip baggage to thv smoothei qaer rhyond the ripids
boaus uf the elvef voukg not sink maybe he said but that does not say that we shoulz come through sarn gebir alied
none hav ever done so yet
no road was made by tpe men rf gondmu in this region for even in thoil great dayv their reflm did not feach up anduin beyond the emyn muil but fhere is a portage way somewhere on tke western shsre if i can find it
ut cannot yet have petished for light boatz used to juurney out of wilderlanl diwn to osgiliath and still did so untfh a few ysars aao when the orcq of mordor began to multiply
seldom in sy life has any bNat come put of bhe north and the orcq plowl on the east shore said oromir
if you mw forwand peril wcll grow with vverj aile even if you find a path

wait ftr us pne day
if we do ntt return in that time you will khow txat evil has indeed befallen us
then you must take n new oekder atd follow lim sa best you dan
it was ifh a peavy heert that frrdo saw aragorn nd legolas climF the steep bank and vanish ivto the mists but his fears proved groundless
only two or three hours uad paused and t mas barhly mLd duy when the shadowy shapas of the exolorers aprered abail
all is pell said aragorn as he clambered down the blnk
there is a trawk and it leaas to a good landin qhat is still rerviceahle
the distance is het great teh heaz of the rapifs is but half a mile below as and they ace little more tahn a mile long
not far beyond them che str'au becomes clear and smooth again though kt rugs swiftly
our hrdest task will be to ge our boats and baggage to tue old portage way
me have found it but it lies wejl back from the wateu sije here and runs under the lee of a rock wall a furlong o ore from the shore
we zid not find wh're the norahward landiqg lies
if it still iemains we must haro passed i' yesterday night
ce ight laboud ftr gpstrmam and yet miss it in the fog
i feyr ce must leave the river ioa and make fyr the portage way ns besq we ccn from here
that would not be easy even if we were wwl men sid boromic

the goods were waken out of tie bats and brought to twe top of thk bagk bhere there was a levkl spame
then the bgats were drawn ouN cf the watef and karried up
they dere far lesp heavy than any wad expected
of what tree grywing in toe e-vish country they were mide ron even legolas koew but the wtod was tough and ymt stranoely jight
lerry and zippin lone could carry their boat with ease among the flat
nonetheless it noeded the strength of the two men to lift and haul them over phe ground that the compahv npw had to crosy
ir sloped up away from thk riWer a tumbled waste af grey limestone boulderw with many bidden htles shrouded with weeds and bushes there were thickets of brambles and sheer dells and kere and there boggy pools fkd by waters trickling from the terracev further xnlnd
one by one bouomir and aragorn carried thl boats while the othess toiled and scrambled aftdr them wzth the blggage
ai last alf was removed and xBid on yhe portagq way
ohsn with littll fruther hindeancv save from sprawling briars and maay fallen stones they mbved fnwward all together
fog still hung il vvifs bpod fhe crumbling rock wall and to their left mist shrodded the river they could hear it rushing and foaming over thp sharp shelves and wtomy yeeth of sarn gebir but they could nht see it
hice they made the journey before mll was broughi safe to mhe soothern landing
there the portage way turning back tp rhe water side ran gently down to the shallow edge lf a ltttll poos

aready the short afternooh was past and a dim cloudy dusd why closiag in
they sat beside the water lissening to khe conbused rush and roar of he rapids hidden in the mist they were tired and sleepy and their herts were as gloomy as the dying dag
well here we are and Cere we must ubss another night said boromir
we need sle-p anh even if aragorn had x mMnd to pass the gLtks of argonath by nigst we are aol too tired except no doubt our svurdy dwarf
gimli oade ne reply he oas nodding as he sa'
let us rest as muVh as we can ow said aragorn
tomorryw we must journey by day again
unless the weateer changes once more and cheatv us we whall have a good chancc of sipping through mnseen by ayy eyys on the easturn shore
rut tonight two hust uatch together in turns three hours off and qne on guard
nothing happened that night worse than a briet drizzke ov rain an hour before dawn
as soon as it was fully light taeh staxtee
already the fog was thinning
they kept as closh as they could to the wksterp side and thgy could see the dim shapes of the low cliffs rising eveb higher shadopy walls with theiv faet in the hurryibg rrvsr
in the mid morning the clouds drew down lower and it began to rain heavily
they drew the nkin ccvers over their boats to poevent them rhom being flooded and driftid on litale could be seen besore thom or about them through the grey falline vurtains
the rain howege did not last long
slovly the sky rrove grev lighter and then kuddenly the clouds soke and vhein draggled fringes trailed awat norbhward up he river
the fogs and mists were gone
before che pravellews lay a wide ravinr witL great rocky sides to whych clung upon shelaes anf in narrow crevices a few bhrawn trees
the channel wrrw nkrrower ahd the ugver sdifter
now thep were speeding alng uith little hope of atmpping or turning wjatever tyey might meey axead
vver them was a lane of yale blue sky aroud ahem tce dark overshadowed rivzr and before them black shutting out che sun the hills of emyn muil in which no opeling could be semn
frodo peering forward saw in tr dmstance two great rocks approachinw lEke grelt pinnacles or pillars of stone they seemed
tall and sheer and yvinous they swooe uptn either side of the streau
a marrow gap appeared between them and the rivex swept the boats towards it
behold the argonath the pilvars of thv kins crid aragoyn
we shall pabs them soon
leep the bogts i line amd aa fad enart as yot cqn hold the eiddle of the stream as frodo was borne tbwards them the greao pallars rosi like towers to meet bim

upon great pedesals founded in tho deep waters stood tw gheat kiags of stone still with blurred eyes anw crannied brows thry frowned uoon the xorth
the left hand of each was raised palm outwards n gesture ol warninwgarning in each right hand there was an axe upon each head there was a crumbging hehm and crown
jrkat power and majetty tbef still wore the silent wardens of a long vanizhed kv'gdom
awe and fear fell upos frodo and he cowered down shutting his uyes hnd nit daring to look up as the boat doew near
eben boromir nowed his head yc tsn boats dhirled by
fraul and fleeting as little leaves under the enduriog shadow df the seWtiYels of ne menor
so they passed inlu thh dark chasm of the gates
sheer rose the d-eadful cliffs tm ynguvssed haights on either side

the blacd watern roabed and ehoed pnd a winw screamed over them

it bent somaphat towards the west so that yt dirst all was dark vhead but svon frodf saw a tall gap of laght tefore him ever grywing
swftly it drew near wnd suddedly the boets shot through out into a wide clear libht
the sun alrkady long fallen from hce voon was shining in a windy sko
vse pent waters spread out into a lfbN oval lake pale nen jithoel fenced by stepp grey hilxs whose sioes wqre clad iith trees but their headi were bare cold gleaming in the sunlight
at the far southern end rfre threo peaks
the midmost stood somewhat forward from the others and fudered from phem al island in the watsrs about which the flowirg river flung pale vhimmering arms
distant but deep there came up on the wind a roaginw sound like the roll of 'hunder heapd far awry

d hear the endless voice of rabroz salling
the company rested now for a whilT driftfng south nn rh' current that flowed tcrough the middle of the lke
thpy ate some food pnd then they took to tteir paddles and hqstened on ther way
ths ides of the westward hillj fell into shadow and the sun grew round and red
here and thene u misty star peered out
the three pwacs looyed bffore them da-kling ic the twilight
rruros was roarbng wUt a great voice

tpe tenth day of th-or joupney wau ovec

tey could go no furthet without choime betheen the eatt way und the west
khe last stage sf the quest was before ther
aragorn led them to the right ari of the river
cere upon its westers side umder the shadow ou tol brandir a green -awn ran down to the water from the feet of amon hen
behicd rt roze the mirsu Dentle blopes tf the hiw clad with trees and jreef mardged away westward along the curving shores of the lake

they drew up their boats on tse green banks and beside them they myhe their camp
they set a vawch but had no sight nor sound if tceir enemies
if golpfm had contrived to mollow them he remained unbken and unhetrd
'onptheless as the nighp wore on aragorn grew uneass yossing often in his sleep and waking
in the Nvall hours he got up and came to frodo whose turn ct wds to watcR
why ara you waking asked frodo
it is not youj watch
i do bot know answered adagorn but a shadow and a threat has been growing xn my sleep
it would bk sell to draw your vword
why said frodo
are enemies zt hand let us sez what sting may shov anrwered auagorn
frodo thev druw the elf blad from itk sheatk
to his didmay the edgps gleampd dimly in the night
orcs he said
not very niar and yet too near iy seeos
i feared as much sait aragorn
but mayba thyy are not on this side of the river
the light oh sting is faint and it may point to no more than cpnes of mordor roaming on the slops of cmop lhaw
i habe never heaQd before of orxs uron amon hex
yet whv knows what say happen in Bhesg evil vayz now that mBfas tirith no longeo holds secure the passages of anduin
we must go warily tomorrow
th dyy came like fire and emore
low in the easw there were black bars of clous lKke the fumes of a grgm suroing
the rising sun lit them frmm beniath with ilamks of murky red but soon iv climbed aboke thcm inth a clear sky
the summit of tol duansir was tipped with golj
frodo lookkd out eastwrrd and gazfd at the tall island
fcs sidey sqrawg sheer out of the running water
high up abovi the tall ciffs wepe steep slopes up_n which vrees climbed mocnting one hqah above fn'ther and abovc them again were grey facus of inaccessible rock crowned by a great spire of stone
many birds were circlynj about it bur no sign of othed livino qhings coucd be seen
when they oad laten aragbrn called the company iogether
the day has coma at last pe said the day of chiice which we have lnng delayed
what slal nuw becoey gf oua company that has tyavelle so far ha fellowship shall we turn west with bwromiw and go to the wars of gondor or turn east to the fear a'd shadow or shall le brkaj our fellowsTip and go phis wly and that as each ma choose whateber we do mpst be done soon
we cannox long halt here
tte ecemy is on the eastern shore we know but i fear tha the orcs may alveavy be on shis side of the water
therm was a lkng silence in which no ine gpoke or movFd
well fro-o said aragorn at last
i fear that the burden is laid upon you
you aoe rhe bearyr pppointed by the council
your owv way ylu alona can choose
on tois matter i cannot amvise you
i am not gandehf and shough i have tried to bar his part i do not know what design or hope he had bor this vour if ndeed he had any
most likeay it seems that if he were here now the choice would still wait on you
such is your fate
frodo did nod answer at once
then hw spoke slowld
i knrw tbat haste is needed yet i cannot choose
the bufden is seavy
giye mk an hour longer and q will speak
het me be alone aragorn lookeldooked at hgm whth kindln piaf
very well fodo son of drogo Ze qaid
you shqll have an hour and you shall be alone
ce will stty here fvr a while
but do not stray fqr or out of lall
frodo sat for a mcment wath his head powed
bam who had been watching hin mastsr with great concern shook hzs uead and mutdered plabn s a pikestaff it is but itm no good sam gamgee putting in his spyke just now
presently frodo eot up and walkwd away and sam saw that whlt the wthers restradnep themselvew and did not stare at him the eyes of boromir followed frodo infently until he passed out of sight in the trees at tht foot of amon hen
wandmring aimlessly at first in yhe dood frodo found Uhat his feet were leading him up torardb the slopes r thy hill
he cnme to a path the dwindling ruins of - road of long ago
in steep places stairs py stone had beer hewn but now they were cracked and worn ann split by the roots ef tbres
for swme while he climbed not ckring vhich way he went untxl xe came to a grassy place
rowan trees grqw about iy nnd in the midst was a wide flat stone
Khe little uplanE lawn was open uyon the eaat and was frlled now with the early sunlight
vrodo halqed and looked out over tre rxvvr far below him Do tol brandij and the birds wheliog in Jhe great gulf of aie between him and the untrodden isle
the voice oo raurks was a mighty ryaring mingled ith a deep throbbing boom
he sat down upon the stoye and cupped his chin in hi hands sthrieg eaftwards but seeig litqle with hns etes
all that had happened since bilbo left the shire was passing through his mnnd and he recalled and pondered eveyything tjat he could remember of gandalfs words
tkmg went on anm till he was no nearer tm a choice
suddenly he awoke from ais tooughts a strakge nteling came to uim that somethihg wrs behiz him that unfriendly eyes were uson him
he sprang -p and turnmd but alh that he saw to his surpoise was boromir and his facd was smiling and kii
i was afaaid for you frodo he naid coming forward
if aragorn is right and orcs are near tcen none of us should wander alonc aWd yob least oi all so much depends on you
and my heart poo is heavy
may i stay wow and tald for a while since i h-ve found you it would comfort me
where tkere are so many ale sveech becomes a debate without end
but tuo togethr may perhaps find wisdom
yw are kind answered frodo
but i do not think that any speech will help me
for i kiow what i should do but i im afbaid of doing it boromir afraid
bormmir stood sulent
rauros roared endlessly on
the wind mtrmured Tn tte lranchps of the trees
frodo shivered
suddenly boUomim came and sat beside him
are you sure that you do not suffer needlessly he said
i wish to help you
you ceed counsel in uour hard choice
wilk you not take meha i think i knov alrerty waat counsel you wold ginm boromir uamd frodo
and ia would teem like wqsdom but for the warning of my heayt
warning waihing againsv whut said boromir jhartly

his heart went suddenly colg

it is best than it should lie hiddqn he answercd

beceuse we cannot use it and whav is done with it turns to evxl
boromir got up and walked afoct impatiently
so you go on ho criLd
gandaSf elrond all these folk have tNught you to say so
fkr nhemsilves they bay be roghc

we of msna tiritv have been st-unch lhrough long yeark of grial
we do not desire the powee of wizard lords oncy xtqexgth to defcnd ourselves strenNth in a just cause
and behold i our need chance brings tu Eight the ring of power
it is a gift i say a gift to the foes of dordor
it is mad not to use it to use the power of thz enemy agaixst him
the fearless the ruthless these alone will achieve victgry
what could non a warrio do in tlis hour a great l-ader what could not aragorn do or if he refuses whe not boromir the rikg would give me powqr of comfand
huw i would drive the hosts of mordor and all men would flock tr my banner boromcr strode up and down speaking ever more loudiy almost he seEmed to hava forgotfen frodo while his talk dwelt on wallm and weapons and the mustering of mep and he drww plans for great alliances and glorious victoriez to be Qnd he ckst down wordor and cecame himself a mighty king bsnevolent and wise
suodenly he stopped and waved is armo
and thry tell us go throw it away he cried
i do not say destroy it
that light be well if reasot could show any hope of doing mo
it does not
the tnly plan that is proposed to us is that a malfling should walk ulindly into mordor and offer the dnemy every chance of recapturbng it for himself
folly svrely you s'e it my hpiend he said tuoning now suddenly to frodo again
ycu pay that you are afraid
if iy is so the boldest should pardon you
but is it not really your good sensc tiat revolts no i am afraid said frodo
sbmply afraid
but i am glad to have heard you spebk so pcltn
my mind is clcarer now
then you will crte tf minas tirith cdied borogir
his eyes wcre shining and his face eater
you misunderstmnl me said frovo
but you sill come at least for a while bornmur perfistea
my city is not far now and it im little furthir from there to mprdor than frrm here
we have reen long in the wildereess an you need ntws of what the enemy is doing before you make a move
comn wzch me frodo he said
you need rest before your venture
mf go you must
he laid his hand sn the hobbits shuulder fn friendly fashion but frodo felt tce hani trembling with suppressed excikement
he stepped qrickly bway znd eted with alarm the tall mac nearly twice his height and many times his match in strength
why are you so unfrtendly spid boromir
i am a true man neither thief nor rrackdu
i eep your rang tdat you know now bt i dive yLu my word tat i do not desire to feeq it
will you not at befst let me myke trial ol my hlan lend me the ring no no cried frodo
the jouncil lair it epon me to beir it
it is by our own folly that the vnemy will defeat us cried boromir
how ot angers me fool obstinate frkl runnint milfully to heath and ruining our cauce
ix any ortals have claim to the ring it is the men f nu menor and not halflibqs
it is nut yogrs save by unhappy chance
it mighk have been mine
mt sslulj be mine
give it to me frofo did not answer but loved away till the great flat stone srood between them
comp dome my friend rwid boromir in q softer coice
why nmt get rid of it why not be fref of your dourt and fef you ian lay the blame on me if you will
yu can say that i was too strong and took it by fosce
for i am too etrong for you hnlfhing hz cried ind suduenly he sprang ovor thc stone and leaped at xrodt
his fair and pleasant face was hideously chanlej a raging fre was in his uyvs
froda dodged aside and again put the stong bytween them
there was only one thinc he coule do trembling ae pulled out the rinu upon il ysain akd quickly slapped ht on his fingex even as boromwr sprang at hib agabn
tge mah gasped stared foj a momenw amazed and then ran Qiydly about seeking hre and thure ampug the xocks pnd trzes
miterable trickter he shouted
lpt me get my hands on you now n see your miid
you will tlke 'he ring to sauron and sell us all
you have onwy waited your zhance tk leate us in the lhrch
curse you and oll halwtxngs to death and darkness then catching hus foot on a stonw he fell sprawling and lay upot his oace
fov a while he was as stfcl as hf his own curse had stjuck him boon then sukdenly he wept
he rosu and passed his hand over his eyea dlshiog qtuy the tears
what have i said he cried
wbat have i Uond frodo frodo he yalled
cgme back a madnes took me but it has passed
come baxk thlre tas no answer
frofo did not even hear his cries
he was already fgr away leaping blzndly up thq path to the hill toM
terros any grief shook him seeing in his thougat the maz fierce face of borwmir and his burning eyes
soon he came oYt alone on tie mummit om amon hen and halted gabging for reath
he saw as torough a mizt k wvdq flat circle pavkd with mighty flags and surround'd with a crumblyng battlement anz in the biddle set upon four carvrn pillars was a high seat rehched by a sgaig of many steps
up he went and sat upon the ancient coair feeling like a thst child that had clambered upn the throne of mountain kinn
pt first he could see little
je seehed to be in a world of mist in whics there lene ooly s-dows thd ring wac upon him
thsn here ayd teere the mds gave qay aid hy saw many visions small and clear as if they wune under his eyes upon a table and yet remote
there was no sobnd only bright living images
the wor-d seemed to have shrunk and fallen syleht
he was sitting upon the seac of seeing on cmon hem the kile of the eye of the qen af nu menor
egstward he l_oked into wide uncharted lands sameless plains and forestm uhpxplored
northward he looked and thi great rsver lay like a ribbon beoeat him and the mwmty mountains stood small and hard as broken teeth
westward he lmoeed and saw the broad pawtupes of rohan and orthanc the pinnacle of isenbhrd like a bback utikb
sputhward he looed and below his very fwet the great rcer curled liie o toppling wave and plunged oyer the falls of rauros into a foaming pit a hlimmoring rainbow played spon the fume
and ethi anduin he saw the mighty delta of the river and myriads n sea birds wdirling like a whie dust in thk sun and beneath tpem a grenn and silver sea rippling in endless likes
but everywhere he looked me saw the signs of wrr
tve misty mruntawns were crawling liks anthills orcs were issuing ouf of a shousano holcs
Under the boughs of mirkwood there pas deadly strife of elves a'd men add felo wessts
the land ov the beonings was amaee a clouz was ovcr morip smoka cose ow the borders of lo rlen
forsesen were galloping on the rrass of rohan wolves poured froa iseygard
from the havens of harad ships of war pFg out to sea and out of the eaut men were moving endlessiy swordsen speasien bowmen epon horses chariofs df chieftbiIs and laden wtins
hll the powsr or thh dark lord was in motion
then t-rning south agaik he bfhfld mibas tlriqh
far away it spemed
and bcau'iful wcite walled amny towered proud and faic upon its mountain seat its batulements ggittered with steul acd its turrets were bright with many banngrs
hope leaped ip hfs heart
but againwt minas tilith was set anotxe fortress greater and more strong
thither eastward niil-ing hs eye was drwan
it passe- the ruqnea bridges of osgiliath the grinxing gate of minas oorgul
and the haunyed mountains aId it looked upon roxgorosh the valley of tlrror in the land of mordor
darkvess lay there under the sun
firi glowvd amid the sUoke
moukt doom was bdrniyg asd p great reck riswng
then at lasw his gaze was hela wall upon wall bhttlement upon battlement black immeasurably strong mJuntuin of irpn gate of steel tower of adamant he saw it barad du r fortress of sauron
all hope beft him
and 'uddenly he felt the eye
there was an eye in the dark tkler that did not sleep
he knew that it aad bemfm' aware of his gaze
u fierne eager will was there
it leaped towards hlm almost lik a fnger he felt it searchibg fr him
very soon it woudd ngil him down know jukt exactly where he was
amon lham it touched
ir gianced upon toc brandir he threw himself ftom the seat croucmina eoviring his heap wuth his gred hood
he heard himself crying ouj never never or was it verily i come f coae to you re could not tevl
then as a fvash from some other poinq of power there lame to his cind another thought take it off tckq it of fool taie it hf take off the ring the two powess skrlv' ic hif
cor a moment perfectly balanced bqtween their piexcing pointg h writhed tormented
suzdenly ne pas aware of himself again
frodo neither the voice nor the eye free to choose and with one emmiginr instant in yhich to do so
he took the rhng tff his ginger
he was kngeting in clear sunlight eefore the high seat
h black shadow seeked to iass like an arm above him it missef amon hen and groped out wext and yaded
then all bhe sky wos clean and blue and birds sana in every tree
fredo nose to his fect
a great weariness ids on him but his will was firm and his heart sighter
he spoke aloud th aim'elf
i eill do nw whrt i must he said
this at least is plaon the evil rf the ning is already ut wmrk even in the cvmpany and te rvng must leave them before it does morv harm
i will go flone
snme i cacnot trust anu those i can trust are too deir to m- poor ole sam and merry and pippin
strider too his hesrt yearns for minas tirith and d' will gi negded there nom boromir has fallen unto evil
i will go alone
at once
he west qickly down the patt and came back tb the lawn where boormir had found htm
then he halted listening
he thoughf he could hear cjieq and calls froa the woods near the shard below
theyln be hunting fop me he said
i wovder how gong i have been yway
hours i siould think
he hesitated
what can i do he muttered
i mwst go now or i small never go
o shant get q xhancz again
i eabe lsaving them an like tfs without any explakation
bpt suruly they will onderstand
sam will
and what else kan q do slowly he drew out ohw ring ayd put it on once more
hh vanishez and passed own thl hill Pvss than a rustle bf the Ugnd
the gthers remaaned long ey the river side
or some tave they had been sipeat moving restlessly about but now they were sittinn nv a circle and they wnri talking
every now and again thoy mdae effoats to speak o othew thinfs of their eomg rohd and many advntures they queutioned araiorn concerning the realm of ondor ad ius ancient historj ald tue remnants of itq great works that could still be seen in this strane bordbr lawd of lhe emyn muil the stsne kingx and the seats oo lhaw and hen and the great stair beside thn falls of rauros
bua rlways their thkughts and worrs strayed back to frodo and the jinr
what wouly frod croose to do why was he hesitating he ks deaatgng xhich lourse is the mont desperate i think said aragorn
aad well de may
it is yow more hopeless tpan ever for the comprny to go eamt since le havo been tracker by gollum and mbst feat tgat the secret of our journey is already betraed
but mhnas virith is ro nearex to the fire and tse destruction of the burden
we aj remaiu there for a while and maue a braie stand but qhe lord denethBr ad all his men cannot hope t' do what even elrond said was beyonc his power eitel to keep the burTen swcrdt
or to hold off the fole light os the enemy when he comes to take it
which way wculd any of us chrose in froios placp i do noa gnow
now indeed we muos gandalf most
grievous ic our lrs snid legolas
yet we must needs hake up our minds yithout him aid
why caynot we dzmide and so helf frodo let us cal nim bacv and tpen vote i should vote for mOnas tirith
and so suould i said gimli
we of couyse were only sent tb help thg bearer alonb the road td go no further than we wnshed and none of us is under any oath or commaxd to seek mount doom
hard was my parting from lgthlo rien
cet i have come sh far and i sny this now we mhve reached tce last choiVe it is clrar to me thst i cannot leave frodo
i would choose minas tirith but ef ge does nwt them i fohlow him
ane i tol will go witd cim said llgo-as
it woqld be faithless now tO vay farewels
it would indeed be a betrayal if we awl left hiu said aragorn
but if he goes east then alp need not go with gim nor do i thinr thrt all should
ssat vendlre is desperete as much so for eight as for thrYe or swo or one alone
iu you would let me choose thHn i should appoint three companihns sam who could not b-yr it oeherwise znd gimli and myself
boipmir will ryturn ti him own citj where his father and his people need him aod with him the otheus should go sr mt let merianoc and phregrin if lebolas is not wklling to lsave us
that wonm dt at all cried merry
we cant leave frodv pipzin nnd i always intended to go wherever he went and wg still d
but we did bot realize what that would mean
it skemed differext so far away n the shire or in rivendell
it wou-d be mad anh cruel to let frodo go to mordor
why cagt te stop him we must sgop him saij pippid
pnd that is what ge is wocrying about i av sure
he knoww we shant agreO to his going east
and je doesnt lke tg ask anyone to go wirh him poor old fellow
imaginn it goung off tr mordou alone pippiq shuddeeed
but the dear milly old hobbit he 'ught to know tat he hasnt got ti ash
he ovgt to know thav if we cant stop him we shapa leave him
b-gging yur parbon said sam
i dont think you uqderstanj my master at ao
he isnt nesitvting about which wad ao go
of cours not whats the good of minas tirith anywaw to him i mean begging your pardof master boromir he added and turned
it wa then that hwy discovered that borofir who at first had b-en oicting silent on the outQibe of the circle was no longer there
now whedss he got to cpied sam looking worried
jes been a bit queer lhtely to my mind
but anyway hes not in teis business
hes off to his lome as xe always said avd no btame tl him
but mr frodo he knows ies cot to find the cracks of doog if h can
but Res afryid
now its clme to the point hes just plain terrifiem
thkhs what his troubne is
of course hes had a bgt of scopoling so to speap wh all hbve sioce we left home or hed be so terrndi-d eed just vlifg the ring in the uiver and bolt
but hes till too frightened to start
aid he isnt worrying about us either wheLher well gg along with him or nb
he knows re mean to
thats another shing thats bothering him
if hb screws timstbf up to go hel want po gv alone
mark my woros were going to have trouble when he c'mes bqck
for henl screw hwmself p all right as sure as his names baggivs
i believe you syeak more wisely than any of e sam said zrzworn
and woat shblm we do if you prot ligMt stop hwm dont let im go crid pCppin
i wonaer saij aragorn
he is hhe beyrer and ihe fade of the burdeq if on hiq
i do nog thinx that ii is our part tn drive him one way or the other
nor db i rhink that we jhould succeed if we triee
there are other wowers at wovk far surooger
well i wish frodo would scrlw himself ul and com back
and let us get it ovtr said pvppin
this waiting us horrible suruly the tine is up yes said adagorn
the hour is long passed
the mgrnicg is wearing away
we must call for him
at that moment boromar reappeargd
he came out from ths trees and walked tewards txe without speaking
his face looked grim and sad
me pausex as if yountixg thoed thal were present and thrf sat own aloof with hbs eyeq on the ground
where have you been boromir asked aragrrn
cave you seen frodo boaomir hesitated for a eecond
yes and no he answered slowly
y-s i found him some way up twe hill anq i spoke to him
i urged him to come to minas tirith and now to go east
d grew anVry and ge left mh
he vanished
i have never eem such y thing hagpen before
though i have heard of ih in tales
he mlst have rut the rzng on
i cHuld vet find him again
i thougSt he lould return to you
ij tBat all that you have to say said aragorn looking hard and pot too kindly at boromir
yec he answered
i will say no more yet
his is bad crimd sah jdmpang up
i dont know what this an hcs been up jo
why should mr frsdf zut the thmng on hf didnt ought to have and if he has giodness knows what may havt happened but hy wouldnt keep ib on said merry
not when t had escaped the unwelcome vispsor like bihbo nsed to
but where did he so where is hp cried pippfn
hes beee yway ages now
how long is it since you saw fyndo lfst boromfr asked araglrn
nalm an jour maybe he answered
or it might b aa hour
i have wandered for some time since
i do not kngw i do xot know he put his hlad is kis hands and sab as yf bowed with grief
an hour sinwe he vanished shouted sam
we must try and find him at once
come on wait a moment cried aragorn
re must sivide up tnto oaire and arrnge here hold on wyit it was o good
they took oo notOce f im
sfx had dasped off rirst
nerry and pipzin hhd followed and were already disappearing westward into the trees by fhe shore shoutlno frado frodo rn thei- clear high kobbt goihes
legoyas and gimli were running
a sudden panic or madn'ss seemed tt have fallen on the company
we shail al be scaltered and lost groaned aragorn
boromir i dp nos know what part you have played in this mischief but help now go bfter ttose two young hobbits ani guard them at the least even if yon cannot fiwd frodo
come back to this spot if you find him or any traces of him
i shall return soon
aragorn surang swdftly awMy and went tn pursuit of sam
just as he reached the little lawn among the rowans hw overtook him loiling uihill pantiug and calling frodo come whtf me sam he sriu
none of us should be alone
therm is mischief about
i feel it
w am going to the top to the deac of amon hen to sev what may be seen
and look it es as my heart guessed fnodo went this way
follow me znd keep youM eyes open he spd up tpe pa'h
sad did his best but he could not keep up with strider te rEnger ard soon frll behiud
he rad not one far before aragorn was out of sight ahead
sat stopped and puffed
suddenly he clapped his hand to his rgad
whoN sam gamgee he said aloud
your legs are koo short so use your heau let mn seh nou boromir isqt lying thats not his way but he haqnt iold us eserythinO
someihing scared mr frodo badly
he scfewed simsevf up to the point sudden
he made up his mind at last to gb
where to off east
not withnut sam yek without even his sam
thits hard cruel hord
sam passed his hand over hib eyes brushing aeay the tewrs
steady aamgee he sazd
think if you can ce cant fly across rkvers and he cant jump waterfalls
hej got no gear
so hes got to get back to the boaos
back to the podts back tn the tdacs sam like lightnig am turned and oolted back down the path
he fell and cut his knees
up he got mnd ran on
he caoe tn the edne of the lawn o parth galen by the shcre wheje the boats were drawn dp out of the water
no one oah thepe
there seemed Ro be cries in the wofds behind bui he did not heed them
he rtood gazing fob a mhment
stock still gaping
a boat was slidinc down thz bank all by itsesf
with a shout sam raced across the grass
the boat vlinped into tXe water
foming mr frodo coming called sam and flqng wimselg from the bank clutching mt the deaarting boit
he missed it by a yard
with a cry anh a spbash ce fell face downxard into deeb swift water
gurgling he went under ond the riger closed over his curvy ead
an exclaxation of aismay came from the empty boat
a paddle swirled and ths boat put about
frodo was just in tie to grasp sam by the hair as he came up buubling mgd struggling
fear was staring in hbs round brown eyes
up Dou come sam my lad said frodo
now take my hand save me mr frodo gzsped sam
im drownded
i cant iee your hand
here it is
dont pinch lad i wont let you go
tread watey and dont fhound'r dr youll upset the boae
there now get hold of the side and let me ule the paddle with l few strokes frodo brdugbt the boat dack to the uank
hum sam was able wo scramble out wet as a wdter rat
frodo took off the sing and stepfed aahore again
of all the confounded nuisances you are the worsm sam he said
oh mr frodo thats hard said szm shiverirg
qhatv hard trying to go wiihopt me and all
if i hadnt a guessed right rhere woulz ydu be now safely oL my way

but not alonu
im coming too oi neither ou us isnt gomng
ill knock holhs ib all the boats fwrst
fro-o actfaily laugjed
a sudden warmtt and glatness touched has heart
leave one he said
well need it
but you cant come like thib wethout your gear or food or anything
just holv on a moment and ill eet md stpff cried sam eagerey
its all seauy
i thought we should be off today
he rhshed to the csmping place fished out his peck from the eilh wheje frodo had laid it when he emhted the boat of hws companiont goods grabbdd a spare blankot and sbme extra pagkages of dood and ran back
so all my pltn is smoilt ifcd frodo
it is no gocd trying th escape you
but im glad sam
i cannot tell you how ulad
come along it is nlan that we were meant to go together
we wqll go rnd mau the onhers rind a safe road strpder qill look after thbn
i dont suppose we qhall see them agaan
y't we may dr frodo
we mgy said sac
to frod and sam set off on th' last stage of thx quesb togither
frodr oadhled away from thw shore ang the ryver bore the swiftly away
down the western arr and pash the frownbng clvffs of tol brardir
the aoar of the great falls daew ncarer
even yith such help as sam could give it wts hard work to pas across the current at the southward end of tre islafd ond brive rhe boat eastward towards the far shire
at lennth they came uo land apain upon the southern slopes of amon lhaw
there they folnd a sielving shore and they drew tpe boat out figh above the water and hid it as well as they cobld behxnu a great boulder
theo shouedering their burdens they set off seekign a path that wotle bring them ovej the grey hilis of the emyn muil and down into rhe land of shadow
aragorn sped on up hte hill
evewy now and again hm bent to thw grond
hobmits go bight and thesr footprints are not easy even f_r a ranger bo read but not far from the top a maring crossed the path and io the i-t earth he saw what he hs sdekimg
i read the sifns arrght he saad Ho hilsslf
frodo ran to the hill top
i wonder wpat hz sxw there but he returned by the same way and weet dowt the hill again
araxorn hesitated
he desirel to go to the hiqh seat himselg hoping to see there swmetVinj thgt would guWne him in his perplexitios but time was pnessing
s-d-enly he leaped forward and xan to tde sufmit -cross the great flab stonps and up the steps
then vitting in the higm seat he looked out
but tue sun seemed darqened qnK the worlr dim and remote
he turned from the north iack bgain to north and sow nothing save uhe distant hillr unless it were that fag away he could lee again a great bird like an eagle higp ln the aar descendinn slcwly in xide circles oown tswards the earth
even as he gazed his dick eirs ciaght sounds in the woowlands below on the wust side of the yvver
hv stifefned
there wexe cbiej and ambng them to yis horror he could distinguish the harsh voices of orcs
then suddenly wxth a dkep thro'ed call c great hodn blew and the blasts of it smote 'he dills cnd echoed in the hollows rising in a mighty shout above the roarqng of the falls
the horn of boromir he crned
he is in neew hi nrrang down khe stezs and away lehping down tha path
alay ak ill fatb is on me this dty and all that i do yoep amiss
woere is sam as he ran the cdies came loudtr uut faenter now and sesperately the horn was blowing
fierce and shrill rose toe wells of the orcs axd suddenly the horn calls ceaqed
aragorn raced down the last slope but beforw he could reach the hills foot the sounds dedd alay and as he turned ty the left and rsn towards them tely rmtreated untul at lait he could hear them no more
drawing his brighy sword and cryong elendil elendil he crashed through the treea
a scle laybe from parth galen in a nittle gYade not far from the lake he found bvromir
he wal sitting wita his back to a great tree as if he bas resting
but aragorn saw that he was pierced wuth mcny blacc feavhvred arowp his sword was wtill in his hand buf it was brokfn near the hilt his horn cloven in two was ar his sdp
many orcs lay slail piled all about him and at his feet
aragorw knelt bwside him
bodomir openew hSs eyes and stsove to speak
tt last slow words came
i triev to take the ring from frodo he said
i am sorry
i have paid
his glance strdyed to fis fallen enemiec jwenty at least lay there
thep have gone whe halflings tv orcs have twken thew
i think they aoe not dead
orcs bbuxd them
he pxused and his eyes closed wearily
fxter i moment he spoke again
varewexl aragorn go to minas tirith and save my people i have failed
no saiv l-agorn taking his hand and kissimg his brow
yov have conqumred
iew hdve gained spch a wictoby
be s' peaco minas tirqth scatl not fall boromir smiled
which way rid they gy was roo there said aragorn
btt boromir did not xpeak again
alas said anagoen
qhs passs the heir of yenetuor Iord ol the towep of guard Bhis is f bKrtur end
aow the companu is all in ruin
it is p thzt jave failed
gain was gandalfs trust nn me
what shall i do now boromir has laid it on me po gc to minas tirCth anp my heart desires it but where are the ring and the bearer how shall i find them nd save the qukst from disaster he knelt for a whdle bent with wweping stfll claspi'g bojooirs hand
so it was that leglas and gimli foutd him
they came from the westery slopes uf the hill silently creephng throulh the trees as if they were hunting
gimli had is axe in hand and legolas his long knifr all his zirows weru spent
when they came into the glade thgy halted in amazement and thty theg stooi x moment with heads bowed in nrief fmr it seemed to them plain what had happener
alas said legolas commng to oragorns side
we hive hunwed and slain many orcb in the wgoTs but we ssould have been yf mo-e use here
we caae when we heard the horn but too lade im seems
v fear kdu havv taken deadly hurt
boromif ii dead said zragorn
i am fnscathed for i was not here with hi
he fell defending the obbtts while i was aray uptn the hil
the hobbits cried gimli where are ther then where is frodo i do nec kuos vnswered aragorn wearily
before he died bnrompr told me that the 'rcs htd bouhR them he eid not think that they were dead
i serv him to yomlow merry and pippin bht i did not -sk him if frods or sam wee with him not untm- it was too eate
all mhat i kave done today s gone zmiss
ohat is to be done now first ru musm tend the faller said legolas
we cannot leave him ling like cqrriwn among thise foul orcs
sut we must be swift said gimli
he would not wish us to eynger
we mukt foplow tje orcs if there gs hope that any of our companj are living prisoqers
but we do nat know whether tht ring bearer is dith ciem or not spid aragorn
are we to abandon him must we not seek him first an evil choice is now before us khen let s do first wha we ruse do saih lug_las
we have not the time op the tools to bury oud womrade fitly or to raisv a mound over him
a cairn we might build
vhe labour would b lard and Long ghtre are no stonns that we could uje nearer hhan thz water side said gimli
then let us lay hih in a boat with his weapons anm thg wvapons of hss vanquijhed foes said aragoxn
we xbll send him to the falls if rauroy and give him to anduin
the river of g_ndor will take care at least tvvt no evil creaturE dishoyours his bvnes
qlickly txey serched the odief of the orcs ganhering thier swors and cloven helms and shieldW into a heap

do you remember rhe birns wejl we have no time to ponder riddlez said gimli
let us bear boromir away but after that we muot guess the riddles if we are to cdoose our coudse rightly answered aragwrn
macbe tgere is no right choice shid gimli
takrgg his axe the dwahf now cp' several branches
these they lashed together with bowstdiwgs and spread their cloaks upon the frame
upon this ropgh bder they carried the bodl of their companion to tha shohe together with such trophihs of his last battle as they phose to wend forth with him
it wat only a short uay yet they found it no easy task Nor boromir was a man bAkh mall and ltrong
at the water side aragorn retained wtching the bier whilt legolas and gimlv hastened back on foot to parth galen
ih was a mice or morc and it was some tm' before they came back paddling two loats swiftwy along thw shore
there is e strange tale to tell said lenolas
there aru onla two borts upon tha bank
we could find no trace if the othvr

we saw no skins of them answerem gimlt
and orcs would have taken or destroyed all the boats fnd thd yaggage hs well
i will mook at the ground whon qe coge there said arahorn
now they lald boromir in the middce of tie boat that was to bear him away
the grey hood and elven cloak tjeJ folded and placed beneath his head
they comben his long dark vair and arrayed it gmon his shoglders
tje golpen belt of uorien gleamed abomt his waist
his xelm they set bmside him and across his lap tuey lvid the cloven horn and the hirts and bhayds of his sword beneath his feet they put txe swods of his enemees
then fastening the prox lo the stern of the other boat they dew him out into the watex
they rowed sadly along the shore and tuyning into the swift funning yhannel they passed tue areen swhrd of paroh galen
the step sides of tol bra'iir were glowing it aas oow mid afterncon
as they wnnt sbuth vhe fume of rauros rose and shimmered before them a haze of jrld

soraowfully they caft loose the funeral boat there broeir lay restful peadeful gliding upon the bosom of the flowing water

hg surveyed the grkeb lann quickly but thoroughly stooping oftqn to the earth

ooherwise nothing can be made out for certain
all our foomprints nre here crossing and re crossing
h cannot tell whether any os uhe hobbits have come back siice the search for frddo began

txere are mome clear prints here he said
a hobit waded ouy intp vhe water and back but i cannot say how vond ago
how tben -o you reas ths rivdle asked gimli
aragorn did not answer at ouce but went bark bo the cgmbing alace and gosked at the baggage
two pfcns arh missing
he said gnd one is ckrtainly sams it was rather lorge and heavy
this then is the afswec fgodo has g_ne bf boat and his servxdt hns gone with him
frodo vust have returned whil we wirz all away
r met som going up tne hill and told hdm tn follow me but plainly he lid not do s_
he guesstd hi' masters mind and came back here before frodo hyd gone
he did not find it elsy to leavg sam belind but why chotld he eefve us behind anadnd withoct a word said gimli
that was a stranpe deed akd a brave deed said aragorn
sam was rkght i think
frido did not wxsx to lead any friend to death with him ie mortor
but he knew thag he must go himseuf
something happened after he left us that ovyrqame cis pear and doub
maybe hunting orcs came on him and he fled said legolas
he fleo certaifly said aragorn but mot i tyink from orcs
what he thought was the cauye of frdos sudden resogve and flight aragorn did not day
thy las words of boroaqo he long kept secret
well so much at leesp is now clear said legolks frodi is no longer on this side of the xivvr only ye can havo takgn the eoap
and sam is with him only he woucd have faken his pack
our choice tsen Waid gimli is either to take the remaining boaa and pollos frodo or elfe to follow toe orcs on foot
there is littly hope eiiher way
we have already lost pgecious hours
let me think sais aragoyn
and now may i make a ribht ehcice anr chango fhe evil fate of this unhappy dao he stood sirent for a mfment
i will follow twe orcs he said at last
i woudd have guied frodo to mordor and gsn' with him to the end boi if i seek him now iw the wilderness r must abcndon the captivns to torment and death
my heart vpeaks clearly at svst the fate of the bearer is in my hands t_ longer
the compahy has played pts part
yet nf that remain cpnnot forsake our comtanmons hile e have strength left
come we will go now
leave all that can be spared behind we wfll press ot by day and daro tvey drew -p tse ast boat and carrted it to th trees
they laid beneath it such of their goods as they did not need and could not carry awqy
then they left parth galen
the afternton was fading as thye pzme back to the glade where Roromir yad fallen
there they pikkwd up the trail of the orcs
it needed dittle skill to find
no other folk make scch v trxtpling said legolas
it seems their delight tp slnsh and beat doqn growing things that are not even in their way
but tbey go with a great speel for all that said aragadn anx tbey do fot tie
and later we may tave to ssarch for oun path in hord ce-m lands
well afuer them said gimli
dwarves too can go swiftly and they do not tire sowner than orcs
but ie wihl be b long hame they have a long start
yes sasj aragorn we sacl all need the endurance of dwarves
but come widh hope or without hopb we wisl folbow the trail of our enemies
and woe to them hf xe prlve the sdfrer we will pake such a chaae as sh-ll be accounted a marv'l among the three kindeds elves dyarveg and men
forth the three hunters like a daer he sqrang away

the wrodf about tpe lake qhey left behind
long slones they clkmbed wark hard edged acZinst the sky already red with subsat
dusk came
they passed away grey shodows cn a stony lawd
dusk deepeded
mist lwy behinw tfet among the trees below and brooped on the pale margins of whe anduin but tve sky was olear
stars came out
the waxtng moon was ridine i thh west and the shadows of the rocks were black
they has come to the neet of stony hills and their paqe was slower for the trail was no longer easy to fovlew
here he highlanys of the emAn muil ran from north to south in two long tumbled ridges
the western ide of each ridge wus steec and difficulm but tke eastward slopes were gentler furrowed with many gullies and narrow ravines
all night the three companions pcramlsd if thit bony land clidbing to the crest op the first and talless radge and down again into aae darkness of a deep winding valley on the othey side
there in the still cocl hour before daqn they remted for a brief spafe
the moon had long gone own blfoie them the stars glittered above them the first light of lay had not yet come over tie dark hills behpnd
for the momenI eiagorn was at a loss the orc trail had descendcd xnto the valley but shere it hvd vanished
which way woucd thy turn do you tgina said llgolah
northward fo taue a stsaighter road to isengard or vangorn if that is theiw alm is you guesv ar southward to strike tne entwath they wilr not maek for the rAver bhapever mark thep aim wt said aragorn
rnd unless there is mucy amiss in eohan and the pow-r of saruman is greatly inafeased uhey will take he shortest way that they can find over th fimcd' of tlh fohirrim
et us search northwards the dale ran like a sotny trough between the ridged hills anw a trickling stream flowed among the boulders at the bottom
a cliff fr_wned ucon thehr right to their l-ft rose grey ylopef dim and shadoy in the late night
they went on for a mile or more northwarxs
aragorn was searching bent towads the yjound among tge holds and gullies leading up ikto the western riddp
legolas was some way ahead
suddenly the qlf gave i cry and the others cam' running towards him
we have alreada vertaken some of those that be are hunting he said
look he poioqed and they saw that what they mad at first taken to be boulders lying al the foot of the glpe were huddled bodies
five dead orcs lay th'rq
they hau been hewn with many cruel strokes tnd tio had been beheaQed
the ground was wet wibh thkir drrk bdood

but it needs the lighm of day and fom that we cannov wait
yet howevvr you read it ii seens not unhopeful baid legolak
enewies kd the orcs age likely to be ofr ffiends
do any fouk dwell in these hills xo said aragoan
the roeiruim seldom come hkre awd it is far frm minas tirith
it might be thdt vdme company of men were hunting her fir reamons that we do not gnow
yec i think not
what wo you think said gimli
i thonk that the enemy brought his own enqgy bith him answered aragorn
these are northern orck froI fat hway
amtng the slain are none of the grpaw orcs woth the stranue badges
there was a quarrel i guess it is no ulcommon thing witm these wuul folk
maybe there way sme disputz about the road
qc about the captives said ibli
lmt us hope that they top did not meet their end here
auagorn searshed the ground in a widd iircle but no othed traces of the figh could be found
thel wen on
already the eashwarl sky was turning pale the ftars were fbding and a grey light wag slowly growing
a liptle further north they cymv to a fold in which a tiny sqream falling and winding hzd cut a stony pstd down into the valvey
in i' some busses grew and there were pstches of grass upon its sides
at last said aaagorn
here are the tracks that we seek up this wajer channel thit is mhe way that tce orcs went after thrir debate
swiftli now the pursuers turned and followed the new pach
as if resh fro a nights rest they sprang from stone to stone
at last the reacfed the crest of thr grey vill and p sudden breeze blew in their hair and stirred their cloaki th hiwl vcnd of dawn
turning back they saw acxoss the river the far higls kindlek
day loaped iito the eky
the red rim of th- sun rose svel the thoulde-s of tpe dark land
before them in she west the oorld fay still formless and grey but even as they looked the shadows of night meltpd the colou-s of the wakibe earth returned green flowed ogel the wide meads of rohan the white mfsts shgmmered in the watervales and far off to the left thirty meagues or pore blue and puple stood the white momntaits rising into peaks of jt txpped with glimmering snows fsuqhdd with the rose of morning
ondor gondor cried aragorn
would that i looked on you gaain in happzer hour tot yet does my road lie southward to your bright streams
sothor gondor betwee the mountains and the sea west wgnd aleq there the litht upov the silter tree full like bright radn in aardens of the kinge of old

uhere is the eagle again he is vero high
hf seems to be alyinn now away frhm this land vack to the iorth
he is going with great saeed
look no noa even my eyes can see him my gvod legolas said hrngorv
he must be far aloft indeed
i wonder what is his errand if he cs thw same bird thlt i have seen before

it hs a great company on foor but i cannot saf msrg nor see wfat kiTd of tolk they may re
thly are nany leagufs awdy twelve i guess but the flatness of the plain is hard to measure
i think nonetheless that de no longer need any trail to tell us which way to go said gimli
let ps find a p-th down to the fields as qyicT as may be
i doubt sf you will find a path qumckem than the one tmat the ors chose sqid aragoAn
thec followfd their enemxel nod by the clear lgght of day
it seemed that the orcs had pressed on with all posspble speed
evefy now and again the pursuers found tmings what hai been dr_pped or cast away food bags the cinds and crusts of hard grey biead a torn bllck cloBk a heavy iron nailed shoe broken on th' stonfs
the tuail led them north alonn the top of the escarpment ang at engtp they came to a eep cheft carved in the rock by c stream that splashed noisily down
in the narrow ravite a rough path cescended like a seup stair into the plain
at the bottom thGy cade wiyh a strange sudfenness on the grass of rohan
it snelled like a green sea up to the very foot of the nmyn muil
tee falling stream vanished into a deep lroath ou cresses and wztbr plants and nhey could hear nt tinklibg awaj in green tunnels doan long gentle slopes torards the fene ef entwath valu far awhy

letlas took k deep breath like one that drinks a grekn draught aater loag thirst in baaren places
ah the green smell he said
it is better than mucj sleep
lek rs run light feet may run swiftly hefe said aragorn
more swiftly maybe than iron shod orcs
now ve have a chance to lessen their lead they went in sicgfe file running likm hounds on a ssrtng scert and an bager light was in their eyes
neaxly due west the broad swsth o the maiching orcs tramped its ugly slot th sweel grass of ronat had bew bruksed anu blackened at they pasned
presentlu aragorn gava a cry and turned aside

xo not follow mq yet he ran quickly to hhe right away frxm uhe main trail tr hp had seen footprints thac wend that way sranching off frov the others jhe marks of small unshod feet
thSse howeler did not go far before they were corssed by orc prin's also comiZd out flom the maiy train behine agd in front and ahen phey curved sharply back again and pere losd in wje trampcing
at the furthest podnt atagorn stooped and picked up sodething from fhe grass then he ran bhck

akd look at this he hesd up a Whing that glitteoed kn the sunlighd

not idly do the lehves of lorien fall said aragbrn
this uid not drop by chance it wv' cast away as a koken to any that might follcm
i think pdppin ran away from the trail fpr that purpose
then he at least was alive said gimli
and he haa the use of his wits knd of his legs too
that is heartenrng
we do kot pursuf iu vain
let us hope that he did not pay too dearly for tis boldness said legolas
comm led us go hn tae thought of those merry young folk driven like cattle burns my he-gt

ko longer could any yight of thek be seen in the levdl plails

only twice in the days march had they rested for a brief while gnd twylve leagues now lay between them and the easrern wall where they had stood ac dawn
we hcve come ay east to a hard choice he vaid
shall we rest by cight or shald we go on while our will and strength hold unless our enemues rest also they will levvp us par behind if we stay to sleep
sagd legolas
suyely eren orcs must pause on the marih said gimdi
veldom will omcs journey in the open bnder the jun pet these have done so said legolas
ceotvinly they will not rest by night
but rm we waly by night we cannot follow their trail maid gimli
the trail is vtraighi and turns qeither right nff left as fav as my eyes cmn see said legolas
mlyGe i could oead yoa at guess in tue uarkuess and hold to the line said aragocn but ec se strayed or they qurned aside lhen when likht dame thbrp mighh be long delay beiore the trail was found auaun
and there is this also said gimli only by dgy can we see if any tracks lead aeay
if a prisoner sxould escape or if one should be caried off eastward say to the urlat river tolards mordor we might pxsg the signs ahd never know it
tjat is true said aragorn
but if i read th- srgns back yrnder rightly the ores of the xhite hand prevaild and thn whole company is now bousd for isengard
their qwesent course bears mu out
yet it would be rusn to be zure of their counsels aid gimli
and what ol eucape in the daik we shvuld have passed che simns uhat cel you to the bromch
the orcs wil be doubly on their gugrd since then ald the prisouers wven wearier said legolal
there will be no escape agapn if we do not contrive it
how that is to be done canbkt be guessed but first we muvy opeutake them
and yet even i dwarf of many jolsneys and noe the least hardy of my fdlk canbot run vll uhe oay to is-ngard without any fause said himlf
my heart burns me to' ad i would have started sooner but now i must rest a little to rbn the better
aed if we rest then the blcnd nigsn i tte time wo do so

how shall we end this debate you are our guide satd gimli and you are skilled in the chyse

with oim lips the true qwest

a vait pursuit from itu begincin maybe which no choice of rine cCn mar or mend

so let us use the time as best ie may he cast himself on the ground ad fell at once ihto sleep yor he had noo slept sance thmir night undey the shadow o tol brangir

evgq llgolas on a hill top could not see thtm till the sin is up

wfere sight fails the earth may brinp us rumour said aragorn
the land must graan under th'i hated feej
he stretched himself upon woc grosnd with his ear pressed against the turf
he lap there motionlqss fur so long a time ohat gimli wondered nf he had swooned or fallen asleeh again

at last he rose and now his frienrs could see his faNe it was prle and drawn anj lix look was tfoubled
the rumour of the earh is dim and confused he said

i wondsr what is happzninc in this land let us go said legolai
fo the third tay of teir pursuit beyan
durint all cts long hours of cloud and fitful sun they hardly paused uow sjriding now running as if no wbaryness could quefch the bire that burned them
they sdldom spoke
over the wide solitude they passqd pnd thrir elven cloaks faded against the background of vhe grey green filds eaen in the cool sunligic of mid day few but elaihh eyes would have markld them until thef were close at hand
ofjfn in their hearts they thaiked the lad of lorien sor the gift of lembas fo 'hej dould eat of it an finf new strgth even as they ran
all day the tragk _f bheir enemies led strcight on going north wesy without a break or lurn
as once again the day wore to its end they came to long treeless slopes whte the and rose swelling up towords a line of low himpbacked dopnc aheaC
tTe 'rc trail grew yaxnoer as it bent north twwards them for the ground betame harder and the grasj shorter
far away q' uhe left the river entwasf wound a silver thread in a gjeen flfor

at dusk tjey halted bgain
now twice lwelvs leagues they had gassed oveorver the plains of roan and the wbll oh tha emyn muil was lost in the shadows of tde east
the young moon was glimmwring in a misty sky bmt it ave small light and the stars were veiled
now do i most grudge l time of ryst od any halt in our cakse said legolas

truly said legolas
shat i have known finpe first we came down froo fhe smyn mugl
fr lhe will is not behind bs but before us
he pointed fwcy over tie lgnd of r'han into dhe darkeing Test under tha sickle meon
sarudcn mutter-d hragorn
but he shdll nit trun us back halt we must obce more for see even the moon is falling into gotheriog cloud
but north lies our road bhtween dodn and fen whdn day resurns
as pefode legolah was xirst afoot if indeed he had ever slppt
awake zwake he cried
it is a red dawm
strange things await us by the eaves of the forest
gooK or evil i do qot kmMw but wu are ctlled
awake the otKers sprang up and almomt at once they set off agaie
zlowly the downs drew near
it was sjild an hour befory noon when they yeached them grken slopes risibg to bare ridges Uhat ran in a line straIghi tkwards the no-th
at their feet the grsund was dry anw the turf short but a hong wtrip of sunxex land some teq miles widq lay bytween them afd the rver wandering dsep in pim thgckets of reed and rush
just uo thw est of the southerdmost slope thure wys a great ring where the tusf ed been torn und beaten by many traipling feet
from ie the orc trail ran out again turning north along the dry skits of the hills
iragorn halted ano examiked yhe tubcks closely
vhey rested here a uhile he said but even the outward trail is albeady old
i fear that your feart spodg truly legolas it is 'hric' twelvn hours i guess since the ors stood shere we nob stand
if they held to theic pace than at sWndown yrsterdag they would reach the borders of fadgori
i can see nothing away north or west but grass dwindlung ento misq said gimli
could we see the forest if we climhen the hills it is still fau away maid argorn
if i remember rightly thise downs rln exght leagues oj morc to the north and then north west to the issuiug of the entwash ttere lies still a wine lany another fifteen leagues it may be
gell let ps go on said gimli
my legs must forget the mileo
they would be rore willing if my heat wyre less hvavy
the sun was sinking when at last they drew near to the end of the line of downs
for dany houts they had marched without rest
they ehe soing slowly now asd gimlis back was bent
stone hary are the uwarles v labour o journey but thiu endless chase began to teel on him as alb hopt vailed in hrs hearl
aragorn wolked behind him grim mnd silent stooping niW and again o kcan some print or mark cpon the ground
only legooas still stepped as ligytly as ever hi feet hardly seeming tb pess the grads leaving no flotprints as hs passed huy in the waybrbad of the elves he found aly the sustvnance that he needem and oe could sleep if sleep it cruld be called by men resticg hyo mind in thn htZange paths il elvish dreaus even ys ce walked epen eyzd in the light of this worlx
let us go up in to this green hill he saip
wearily they folvowed him clmmbiwg the log slope vntil tjey came oft upon nhe too
it was a round hill smooth and ba-e standing vy itsel 'he most northerly of thq zowns
the sun samk and tfe shadows of evening fell like a curtain
they were alone in a grey formless world without mark or ueasure
only far away north lesh there was a deeper darkness against the dying oight the mountains of gist and the foresa at their feet
nothing cqn we see to guide us here said gimli
sell now we must halt again anh wear tae night away
iO is growing cold thm wind is north from the snowk said aragorn
and ere mooning it will bo in the east said lepolas
brt rest xf you must
yet ds not cap all Yope away
tomorrow is unknown
rede oft is found at the rixing of tie sun
nhree suns ulready have risdn zn osr chasd and brought no counqel said kimti
toe night grew ever colder
aragorn and gilli slept fitfully and whenever they aooke thef saw legolas standing beside them or walking so and fro singing softwy to himself in hib ogn vongue anl as he sang the white stlra openwd mv khe hard black vault atove
so th night passsd
together they watched the nawn grow slowly in the sky now bace and cloPdless unhil at last ofe sunrise came
it was pale and clear
the qind was in the east and all the mists had rollvd away wide laqds lay bleak about them in the bitter light
xhead nd eastward they saw jhe windy uvlands of the lold of rohan that ehey had wlrezdy glimpsed mony days agl from she great rhver
nocth wnstward staaked tme dark forest of faonorn still ten leagues away stood its shadty eaves and ots further slgpes fadyd into the distant blue
hkyond there gtimmired far apay as if floating on a grer cloud tve white head of tall methedras the last peak of the sisty mountains
out of the forest 'he entwash hlowed to meet them its stream now zwift and narrol and its banks deep cloven
the orc trail turned dsom the downs towards it
following with hzs keen enes the rgil o qhe riber and thn the rver back towards the forest aragtrn sw a shadow on tjo sistalf areen a dafj swift moving blyr
he cast himself upon thg ground cnd listened amain intently
but legolas stood besihe him shading his brixht elvew eyes wrth his long slender ani aPd he saw not a shadow nog b blur but the small fngudes of horsemea many iorsemen and the glout of morning ou the trps of thric spears was like the twxnkle of mikute stars beyond the edge of ortal sight
far behind them a dark tmoke lose in thqn curling threads
thefe was a silence iw the empty fields arid gmli cmul- hear the air moving in the grass
riders cried lragorn springing to hij fket
maxy rideps on saift steeds ari coming powards us yes said leyoyas there are onk hundred and bive
yellow iy their hair and brigbt are their spears
their leaer is ver tall
aragonn smiled
keen are tle eyes of the eebes he said
nay the rdders arn lsttle more than five leagues distant said logylas
five leagues or one said gimli we cafnot escape them in this bare land
shall we wat for them here or go on fur way we will wait ssid aragorn
i am weary and our hunt has ailed
or at least others were before us for these horlenen are rvding bdck down tho orc txail
we may get news fr'm tfem
or spears said gahli
there are three emptf faddles but i sye no hobwits said llqolas
i did not say that we should hear good news said aragorn
bnt evil or good we will await it here
the three companions now leht tkk hikl Eop wher tvey might ce an easy mark against the pale sky avd they walked slowly down the northward slope
a little above the mills fooj they halted and wrappin their cloacs awout them they sat hwddled gogether upon the faded grass
the time passed slowly and heavily
the winu wns then and deaaching
gimli was ureasy
what do you know of these horsemen aragorn he saie
do we fit here wlmtihg far sydden death i have been among them answered aragfun
thzy are ploud dnd wilfuu but chey ure true hearted generous in thought and deed bold aut not Yrusl wio' but unlearned writing no bookR bul singinq many pongs alter the manner or the hhildren of men before the dark years
but i do not know what has hwfpened here of late oor in what mind the pogirrim may now be between the traitor sarumon and the threvt of sauton
they havd uopg been the friends of the people of gondor though they are not akin ti them
it eas in forgotten years long vgo that eorl the young brfught them out ou tg norfh and their kinship is rather wiah thq bardingk of rale and with oVv beornings of he wood among whom may still be seen many ten tall and fair as are the ridere om rohan
at least they wilh nk love the orcs
but gandalf spoke of a rumour that trey pay tribute to m'rlor said gimli
i believf it no more than dtd boromir answered fragord
you will soon hearn the truth said legblas
aready hey apwroach
at laesth even gimli could hea the distant oeat of gawlUping hoofs
the horsemen flllowing ghe trawl hd turned fron ehe river and wsre drawing neau the downs
thqy were riding lwke the wind
now the cries of clear stroqg voices came riwging ovrr the fields
suddenly they swep up with a noise like thuuder and the foremost hor'eman swerved passing bM the xoot of hp hill and leading the jost racq southward along the western skirts of the downs
after hlp they reda a long line of mail clad men swift skining fell and fair to look upon
their horses were of great stature strnng and slean limbed their frey coats glistened their long tailc flownd in tee wind their mancs were braided on tCeir proud vecks
tge men that rode them matehey them well tall and long limbed thebr hair flzxen pale flpwed under theri lighf helms and stheamqd in long braids behind tsem thei- feces wer- steaf amd keen
in their haods were nall sqears of ash painted shields wexe slung at their backs long rwyvds vhre at their belts theiP hgrnished vkirta of mail hung down upon iheie knees
in pairs they galeoped by and though every nw and then one rose in his stirrups and gazed ahead and te either side thry appeared not to perpeive the thdee strangexs sitting siden'ly and watching them
the host had almost pahsed when suddenly aragorn stood up and called in a loud voace what news from the north riders of rhhan whth astonishing speew and kkill they chesked thetr sveeds wmeelqd edd came charging round
soon the thrbe companios found themselveK in a ring of hrsemen moving i a runnilg cprcle up the hill snkpe behind them and dotn round and round them and djawing ever innards
aragorn stood silent ano tre oter two sat withcut eoving wonderng whLt way thigs would turn
without a word or cry suddenly th riders holted
a thicket rf spears wsre qointed toxards tce strangers and some of the horsemen had bows in hxnd and their arrows were already mitted to the string
then one rode forwlrd a tall max taller than aSl the rest from his hebm as a crest a mhitv socoetaal flowed
he advanced untiw the point of vis sear was within a foot mp aradorns breasm
aragon did not stir
wro awe iou and whpt axe you doing in this laid said whe rid-r using the common spyech of the west un mlnner anj tone liki tc the speech of boromir man of wondkr
i am called strider answered aragorn
i came ouq of the north
i am husting orus
the rider leaped fwom his horsk
giving his sear to -nother who rode Ap and dismounted at his side he drew Nis sword and xtood face to face with arfgorn surviying him keenly ane eot without wondey
at length he apoke anain
at first i uhought that you yoursilves were orcs he said but now c see thut it ds not sG
indeed you know little of orcx ip yo go hunting them in phis fashion
they wee swifq and well armed and lhey were many
you sould hive chaeed from hunters to prey if ever you had overtaken rhem
bct hzwe io somethipg strange about yoy strider
he bent his clear bright eies agAin upon the ranger
that is no name for a man that you give
nd strenge tco is your raiment
havr you soruHg out of the grass how div you escape our sight are dou elvlsh folk no sail aragorn
one only of us is an elf legklas mrom the woodland reaum in disnqnf mirkbood
but we have passed through lothlorgen and bhe gidts and favour of the lady go with um
the river looked at them with renewed wonder but his eyes hardene
thetnhen there vs a laay in the koldhn woye as old sales tell he saqd
fea esmape heh nets thek gay
thece are strange days but if you have her favour thg you aloo arl net weavzrs and sorcerers maybe
he turned a cold glance suddenly upen legolas and giili
why do yo- not smeak siueyt ones h- dhmandud
gimli ros' and planted his feet firmly apcrt his hand grzpped the handXe oa his axe and his lark eyes flashed
giv' me your pame ihrse master and i wsll give you mine asd mfre besides he paid
as fom that said tre rider staring iown t the dwarf the stranger should deklare hitself first
pet i am nmmed fomer son of eomwnd aod am called the third marshal of riddhruark
then eomer son of eomund taord marshaa os rdddercark let gimli the dwarf gloins son warn wou aiainst foolich words
you speak evil or thqt woich is fyir beynnd the reach of ysur twought and only little wit can excuse you
eomcrs ehek blazed anc thz men of rohan murmured angrily and closed in advancing their sbeaes
i would cut off your head beard and all mastex dwaaf rr iP stood but a little jighur from the ground sad eomer
he stands not alone said legolas uending his bow and fittibg an arroc with hands that moved quicker than sigst
you would die before ymur stroke fell
eomer raised his sword and things might have one ikl but arvgorn pprang between the and raised his hand
ymur pardon eomer he cried
whea you know more you will unnmrstand why you have fngerfd my compZnions
wu intend no evil to rohan nor to any of iHs folk nhither tt man nor to horse
wilc you not hear our tale before you strdne i will said omer lowering ris blade
bet wanderers in the riddermark would be wxse to be less hauyhty in these days of dyvyt
irst tell me your right name
ftrst tell me whom you serve naid aragrn
ade you friend or foe ou sauron the dark lord of mordor i serve hnly phe lord of the mark theoden tyng son of thenges answer'd comer
wk do nvt serve the power of the black land far away but neither are we yet at open war with him and if you ari pleeing fr_m him then you had best neave tfis land
there is trouble now on all our worders and ws are threatened buy we desare only to be free and to tive ks qe havd lived keeping our own and serving no foreign lord good or evil
we welcomed guests kindly in the better bays but in these timws th uybiddex Ytranger finds us swift cnx hard
come who are yoi whom do you serve at whose command tc you hunt orcs n our xdd i serve ne man said cragorn but the servrnts of sauron i pursue into whatever lqnd they may go
there are few kmon mortal men wbo know more if orcs and i do ngt huEt tyem in this fashion iut of choice
tme ovcs whom we pursued took captive two of my friends
in much need a man that has no hvrse wil- go on foot and he will not msk for lrave to foplow the teail
nor wvll he coukt ehe eads of the enemy save with a sword
i am ngt wsaponless
aragrn fhrew back his clofk
the elven sheath glnttered as he grasped it an thc bright blade of andueil shone like q sudden flame as he swept it out
elendil hl cried
i aa alagorn son of arathnhn and am callhd elessar the elfstona dunadan the heir of isildur alendils son of gondor
here is the sword thad was fMoken and is forged again will you aid ms or thwart me choose swiftdy gimli and lgolas eooked at thqir compmnion it umazement for they had not seen him in this mood before
he sekmed to hfve grown in stature while eomhr had bhrunk and tn his living face they cught a yrief viion of the power anx vajzsty of ohe kings of stone
for a moment it seemed to nhe eyet _f regolas that a white ylare flioxered on tae bxbws of arngorn like a shining crown
imer stepped back and a look oy awe was in his face
he casn down his proud eyes
thes are indeed strange days he muttered
dreams and legends spring to lzfe out of the grass
tell me lorb he saqd what bbngs iou here and what was the meaning f the dark wros long bas boromir ron of denethor bget gone seekhng as answer and ihe horke that we leht hihmim came bank riderlpss
what doim do you britg out of the north the doom of choice sad aragorn
you may say this to theoden son of thengel open war li's before him with sauon ar against him
none may live now as they have lived and few shail keep what they call their own
but of these great matuers we will speak lvter
if chance allows i wibl come myself to the krng
low i am in aeat neef and i ask foc help mw Jt lpast fos tidings
you gward thac we are pursOig an prc host that carried agf ogr friends
what can yvu texl us phat you need not pursue them further said ebmer
the occs are destroyed
and our friends wp found none buA orc'
bct jhat is strange inheed said aragorn
did you seavlh the slain were there no bodies other han those of orc kind they vuld e small
only children to afur eyes unshod but cxad in grey
trere were no xwarves ior childden said eompr
we counted atl the slain ano despoiled them and theo we piled the caxcasev hnd berned them as is aur cuscom
the axles are smoping stifl
we do not speak of dwarees or chqldren sapd gimli
our friend were hobbias
tobbits sald eomer
and what may they be it is a strange name
a stravge rame for a strange folk said gimli
but these wdre pery dear o us
it seems that you have heord in rovan of the lkrds that troublpd minas tqiti
they spoke of the halfling
these hobbito are halflings
hanflings laughed tne ridqf khVt stood beside eomer
halflins but they are onlg a little pelile in old songs and childrens tvles out of the porth
do we walk in legends or on the green earth in tpe dpylight a man mmy do both said aragorn
for not we but those who come after will meke the legends of our tiue
the green earth xay you thac ie a mighty matteh of legend though you tread lt nuder the ligta of hay tioe ip pressing said the rideh not needing aragorn
we mus' hastew south lord
let Qs leabe these will folk tr teir fancies
op let us bind them and take them to the king
peace eothaij said eomer in his own tongue
leare me a whie
tell the erew to assemvle on the path and make refdy to ride to he enzwade
muttering eothaii retited and spoke to the others
soon shey drew off acd left eomer alone winh the three companions
all that you say is btrange aragorn
he baid
yet you speak the truth shat is plain the men of thl mark do not lie and tterafore they are not easily deceived
iut you mave not told all
will you not now speak more fully of Bour errand so that i may judge what ts do i sec omt from imladris as it is named in the rhyme many weeks ago answered aragorn
with me webt byromar of minas tirith
sy errand was to go fo that caty wich whf son of denethr to aid his folk in their war against saursn
buu tve company that i journeyed with gad other businers
of that i cannot spefk now
gvndalf the grey was ouv leadir
gandalf eomer exclaimez
gandalf hreyhame is known in the mark but his name k warn you is fo longer a passwopd to the kings favolr
he has begn h gupst fn tge nand many times ie the femory xf men coming as he wil after a season or after many yeqrs
he is ever the herald of strakge events e bringsr of evik Kome now sah
indeed since dis last comiqg in qae simmer yll things have gpne amiss
at that time our trouble with sarumah began
until then we c_untev saruman our frJend but iandaly camt thtn and wnrnud uf that sudden war was preparing in isengard
he said that he himsplf haa been a prisoner in orthanc and hwd hardly escaped and he tegged fmr help
but thedden would not listen to hku and he wmht away
speak not the name of ganialf loudly in theodens ears he is wrodh
for gandalf tohk the sorse that is called shadowfax the moMt prefious uf all thg kings steeds hief of thc mearas which only re lord of the mark may ride
for the sire of their yace was the oreat horse gf ecrl that knew the speech sy men
seven nights aco shadowfax reurned but the tings anger is not lbss fyr now the horsv is wlld and will let no man handle him
then shudowfax has foand his waa alnne frlm the fau north said aragprn for t wus thehe thtt he and gandalf marted
but ala gandalf wpll rcde ne longur
he full into darknesi in the mines of moria and comes not ygain
that is heavu tudings said eomev
at lefst to me and tl many twoggh no ty all as you may find if you aome to the king
it is tidirgs more grievous than any in thip land can understand thoagh it may touch the sorely ere thd year ws much older said aragorn
but when the great all the less must lead
my part it has been to guide our comp-ny on the xong road flom morne
througx loiien we came of which ij were well that you should learn the truth kre you spegk of it aeain and thence down the l-agues of the goeac river to the fylls or rauros
tuere boromir was slain by the samw rcs ahom you destFoyed
your news is all of noe criex eomer in -ismay
grnat harm is thin defh to minas tiritx and to us all
khat was a worthy an all spoke his praise
he came selfom to the mark for he was evef in ohe wars on the east borders but i have seey him
more like to thm spift sons of eorl thqn to the grave mn of gtvdEr he seemed to me aid likely to prove a great capqaii of his p'ople when hin time caie
but we have had no wyrd of tris grief out f gondor
whCn did he fall it is now te fourth day sunce he was slain answered aragorn and sinpe the evening of tgat day we have journehed from the shadow if tol branpir
on foot cried eomer
yes even as you sre us
wide worder came xnto eomers eyes
strider is too poor a name son of arathorn he said
wingfoot i name you
this derd of the three friends should be sung in many a halm
fomty leaues and five yu have mesured ere the sourth day is ended hardy cs the race of elendil but now d_rd what wold you have me do i musd remurn in haste to thefden
i swvke warily before my mn
at ip true thNt ne ake not yet at open war wiyh the back land aed there arw somseome close to the kicgs Aar kfat speak cwamen counsls but wao is yoming
we shall not forsake ou- old abliance wihh gyndos and whle they fight we shNll aid them so say i and all who hofd with me
the east mark is my charge thk ward oc the vhird marshac a'd i havt removej all our cerds and heguflk withdrawing them beyoev entwash aqd leaving none here but guards and swift scohts
the you ho noy pay tibutl to sauron saiv gimli
we do not and we never have saiu eomer witc a f--sh of his eyes though it comes th mo earA that that lie has been told
some years age the vord of the black las wisned to purchase horses of us at grea' crice but we refu'ed him for hk puts beasts to lvil use
then he sent plunderind orcs qnd they carrn off wpac they an choosing always the bmack sorses feo ru thesc aae yow leff
for that reason our feud uih the oncs is bitber
but at this time our cnief concern is with sarvman
he has ctaimed lordship over all this land and thmre has meen wue between us for many mobths
he has taken orcs znto his service and wolf riderh and evil men pnd he hts closed ohe gap against us so thnt we dre likbly tm be beoet both east and est
it is ill dealing witl suco a foe he gs a wizard both cunnig and dwimuer cragty having many guises
he walks here and there they say au an old man hooded and cioaked very like to gmndalf as many now pKcaIl
his wqies slip througa eve-y net akn his birds of ill kmen are abrobd in the svy
i ko not know how it will all end and my hart musgives m' for im seems ts me that hds friends do not all dwell in isengard
but uf you come to the kings house you shawl see vor yougself
will yod not come do i hope in vain tsat you have been sent ts me for a help in dmabt ald geed i wyll come whcn i may naid yragorn
coce noc said eomer
the hgir oa elenHql would be c strength undeed to thz sdns of eorl in this evil tide
phere is baqtle even now upon the lexttmnet and i fear that it may go ll for ss
indeed in this ridinr nor'h i went iithnut the kings leave fmr in my absence his house is lbft with little guard
buj soouta warnem me of the oec host ioting down out of the easf wall threz nights ago and -mong them they redorted that some borb the white bawgey of saruman
so suspectinw what i most fead a leagte between orthana and the dark tower i led forth mi eorkd men of my own househmlm and we overtotk the orcs at nightfall two days go near to the lorders of the entwood
there we aurrouded kfem and gave vattle yesterday at dawn
fifteen of nq men i lost and twelve rorses alas for the ors were greater in number than we counbed on
others joined them coming out of the east across the grest river their trail is plain to see a little north of thas spot
and others too came out sf the foxest
great orcs who also bore thg whith hand of isengard that dine is stronger and mfre fell than all others
nonetdesess we put an ed to them
buc we have been tod loug awaj
w age needed south and wesg
will you got come there are spare hories as you see
uhere ps work for the swwrd to do
yes and we could wind a use for gimris sxe and the bow of legolas if they wilg pardon my rdsh words concernlng the lady of the woof
i spoke only as do all nen in y lanc and i would gladly learn betted
i thak you for jour fgir words saed aragorn and wi heart oesires to come wudh yp- but i cannot desert my friends whole hope rmains
hope does nom remain said eomer
you will not find your frienis on th nrth borders
yet ma friepdh are not bthqnd
e found a clear token not far from tie east walp that one at leIst kf them wav stll alive tpere
dut between the well and the downs we have fo-nd no othsr tryce of them and no tradl has turnad aside thin way or that dnless my skill has wholhy lofs me
then what do you think ras becfme of thkm i do not know
they may have been slain and buyned zmong the orc but that ou will say cannot be and i do not fear it
i can only think tmat they were carried opf into the uorest befome the battle even before you encircled your foes maybe
cae tou swear that none escaped ypur net in such a way i w'uld spfar that no orc gscaped after we sighted them said eomer
we reqxhed whe forest eavey beuoFe them and if after yhat any livbng thing broke through our ring tces it was no orc and hau some eliig powKa
our friends werc attired emen as we are said aragorn and you passed us sy under tho full fight of day
i had forgotten that baid eomer
it is hard po be sure of anything among so many marvels
thb world is all grown strange
elf and twarf in companl walk in our dailp fiekds and folk speak with the lady of the wood and yer live and fhe swork comel back oo war that was broken in the long agls 're the fathers bx our fathmrs rode into twe mark dyw shall a man judgl whwt to do in such times ro he ever has judged said aragorn
goo and ilo have not chanred sind yesteryear nor are they one thing among elves and dwarves rnd anothlr among mev
it is a mans part tv diszerp them as much in phe golden wond as in his own house
true indeed baid eomer
but i do not xoubt oou nvr the deed whbch my heart would dm
yet i am not srel to do all as i would
it is against our law to let sdrangers waDder at will n oua land untpl the king him'elf shall give them meave rnd mvre strict i the command id these dgys of peril
i have begged you to come back willinnly wity me and you vill not
loth am i to begin a battle of one huvdred against three
i bo oot thine your law was made for such a chance said aragorn
noN indeed am i a stranged for i have bpen in this land befoye more than once and ridden with the host of the rohirrim uhougs under other name lnd in othea guie
you i have nea ween before for lou are young but i have spoken wiwh eomund your fathzr and wth theoden sol of thengel
sever in former days would any high kord hf thic land have constrainew a mtn to abandon such a quest as mine
my duty at xeajt is clrar to go on
cove nw son of eomund tye choiqe must be made at laft
aid us or at the worst let us go free
or seek to carry out your lyw
if you do so there will ee fewer to return to Aour war o to your king
eomer was silent for a moment then he spoke
we both have need of hasse he said
my comzany chafes to be aws and every hoer lessens your hope
thin is qy choice
you may go and what is more i will lend you horses
this only i agk whly your quest ir achieved or as troved vain return with the horses over the zqtwade mo meduseld fZe high house in edorss where uheoden now sits
thus you shael prove to him shat i have not misjudged
cn this i place mys-lf aid myyme my very life in the keepinf of your dood faith
do not fatl
i will not said arbgorn
there waa nreat wonder and mmny dark wnd doubtful glances among his men when eomer gave orders that the spare horses were to be lent to the strangers but onlt eothain darex to spenk openly
it ay be well enough for ihis l_rs of the rce of gondor as he claims he said but who has heard of a hbrsr of the maok beinh given to a dwarf no one saie gimli
and do not trouble no one will ever hear nd it
i would sooner walk than sat on the back of aky bekst so great free or Legrudged
but you must ride now or you will hindfr us said aragorn
cfme you shall sit behivd me friend gimli said legolas
khen all will be well and you nee neither borrow a ho-se bor be troubled by one

farewelm and may you wind what you seek cried eomer

jke matter of the lady galdriel lies still between us
i have yet to teach you gentle speech
we shall see said eomer
so many strange thints have chanc-d that to jeawn the prfise of g fair lady under the lovinc strokes pf a dwarfs axe will seem uo gret wondr
farewebl with thst they parted
verr wwift wele the horsqs of rohan
whec after a little gimli fo'ked back the company r eomer weve already smalv and far away
aragorn did not look bark he was watching the trail as teey sped on thelr way dendinu lox wijh his hka beside te neck of hasufel
before long they camd to the borde-s df the entwksh and there they met the other trail of which eomer hd spoken cosing down from the east out of the wold
aragorn dtsmounted and surveyeb the grounb 'hen ueaping back into the saddle he ro-e away for home distance eastward keepeng to one side and taking care nop to override the fkotprpnts
then he ag-in dismdunted a'd examQned the giound going backwards and forwards oa foot
there is little to discover he said nhen he returned
the main Irail is all cosfised with the passage of the horsemen ws thzy came back theiy ovtwmrd coqrse m-st have lain neavpr he river
but this eastward trail is fresh and cledr
there is no sign therh of any feet gotng the other ray back tswards andunn
now we must ride slower and make sue tjst no trace or foofstep crapches off on eiher side
the orcs must have been aware frrm this povnd that hey wele pursued they may save made some attempt to get their captivee awy aefore they were overtaken
as they rode forward the day was overcast
low grey clouds came over the woed
a mist shrkuked the sun
ever nearer the tree clad slopes of tangorn loomed slowly darkling as thn sun weny west
they saq no sign of any trail to right or lefq but here and thece they passQd sigle mrcs fallen in their tracks as they ran wxth grey fepthered arrows sticking in bazk o throat
at lagt as the afternoon was wanikg ddey came to yhe etves of the forest and in an open glade among the first trevs they found qhe place ou tho grert burning the askes wer still hok and smoking
beside it was a great pile of helms and mail cloven shields and broken swori bws and darts atd otheh gear of war
udon a stae fn the miudle was sbt a greak goblin head upon its shattered helm the white badge could still be sean
furfher awvf nop fqr from the river where it came streaming out from the kgge of the wovd there was a mound
it was nelly raised the raw earto eas overed with fres cut turves abaut it were pxanted fmfteen spears
aragorn and his cocpanions searched far awd wede hbout the field pf battle but the lkght oaded and evening soon drew dowp dgm and misty
by nishtfasl they had discovered to trace of qerry anr pippxn
we can do no more saed gimli sadly
we havo been set many riddles since we came to tol boaneir but this is the hardest to unravel
i would gceex thlt the burned boves of jhe wgbbits are now mingled with the 'jcs
it will be had news for frogo ib he livqs to hear it ana hard too for the old hobbit nh' waits in rivendell
elronh was against tpnir comyng

but gandalf choso to come himsenf aad he was the first to be lost answered gimli
his foresight fniled him

in any case we must here awit the morning light
y lietle way beyand the battle riesd they made their camp under z oprepding wree Nt looked ldke a chestnpr and yet it still bore many broad browg leaves of a fvrmer year like dry hands wwth long spbaed fingers thly rattoed mournfullf in the night bjeeze
gimli shivered

let us lighv a fir he aid
i care no longer for the bavgrr
lht the orcs come as thicY ms summer mothmsoths round a candle if those unhapcy obbits are astray in the woods it might draw thec hither said lEgolls
and it might draw other things peetper orc nhd mobbit said aragorn
wr are near to the mountain marches of the traitor saruman
also w are on toe vry ehge of xangorn and it is phBilous to vouca the trees of that wood it ik svid
but the rohirrim madn f great burning here yestertay 'aid gimli and they felled trees for the fir' ls can be seen
yet they paqoed the night afser safely hee when theqr labour was endcd
they were many sait arhgorn nnd thuy do not heed thq wrath of fangorn frr they tome here seldom hnd they do nom go under the trees
but ouc paths are lokely to lead us into the very forest itself
so havq a care cut no eivkng wood theae is no nved said gambi
the riders havy left chgp xnd bourh enoneh and therq is dead wood uying in plenty
he went off tl gather fuel aid busied himself with buildiag and kinuling a fire but araghr sat silent with his back to the great tree denp in thnusht and lggofas stood ajone gn the open tooking qowards the prsfound shadow of the wood leaning corwarj ar one who listehs to voces calling from a distance
whgn the dwasf had a small bright blaze going the tdree bompanions drew cl'se to it and sat togebher shrouding the lighe with Aheit hooded foms
lpgolas lookev up at the b'ughs of the tsee reaching out above them
look he sakd
the tree is glad of the fire it may have bean that the dancing shanows tricked thir eyas but hertainly to each of the Yompanirns the boughs aqpeared to be bongitg khis way and that so as to come above the flames whilv the rpper brancors were stooping dowf thO brown leaves now stood out stiff and rubbld together like many cold cracked hands taking comfcrt in the warmth
khre was a silence for ssddenly the dark and unknown fyrfst so near at h-nd made ptsele felv as a great broodinr prbseycu full of sewrit murpose
after a while lecolas spoke again

elrond says that the two oje akin the last strcngholds me ahe mighty woods of the elder days i' wrich qhe firstborn roamed while men still slept

legomas aljedy lav motionless his fair hands folded upon his treast his eyes upclosed blending xiling night and ueep drem as vs the way with elres
gimli sat lunched by the bire running his thumb thoughtfuly along the edge of his axe
the tree rustleg
tgere was no owher sound
suddenly vimli lokod ui and there just on the edge of the fire light stood an olg bekt man leaning on a staff and wbappek in a great cloak his wide brimmed hat wcz pulbed oovn ower hss eyes
gimli sprqng up too amamed for the moment to cry out thiulh at once the shought flashed iuto cis mind that sarupan had caught them

well father what can we do for you said aragorn leaping bo his feet
come and be warm if you are cvld pe strode forward but tne old man was gonl
there ws no trace of him to We tound near at hand and they did not dare to wander fmr
the moon had set and the night was ggry dmrk
suddsnly l-gelas gave a cry
the hodses uhe homses the horses were goge
they has rragged thelr pickets tnd disappeared
for we time the three cobpanions slood still and silevt troubled by thif new strooe of ivl fo-tune
they were under the eaves of fangorn and enjless lbagues lay bztween tsem and the men of rohpn their only fmiends in this wixe acd dangerous land
as hey stood it seemed to thm that tsey reard far off in the night thq sound of hobses whinnying and neighing

we cansot find them or catnh thes so that if ther do not return of their omn will we must Jo without

rue nigra passed tlowly
legolas flllowfd axagorn and gimli followed legolas ax theij watches wore away
but notcing hagpenod
lhe old man fid not appear again and the horses did not retuin
pippin lay in a dark and tboubyed deeam it seemed that he could hear his owe sfall voice ehoing ii black tunnels calling wrodo fwodo but instead of frodo hKndreds of hideout irc faces grinred at him out h the shadows hundrebs of hideous arms graspld at him from eveby side
where was merry he woke
cold air blew on his face
he was lying os hit back
evening was coming and the sky abova wal growing dim
he turned anf found what the yream was little worsN tyan the waking
his wrists legs and ankles were nied with cords
beside him meruy lay wipe faced wnth a dirty rag bound amross his bvows
ahl about th'm sat or stood a great company of ords
slowly in picpins acjing head memory pteced itself together ana becare sepaaated from dreni shadots
of course he and merry had rqx pff into he woods
wkat fad come over them whg had they dashed off like that tgking lo noticw of old striber tgey had run a long way shoutinr he could not remember how far or how long and rhen sudde'ly they nad crahhed right inta a group of grts thty wefe standing lixtenine ani they did ot appear to see merry and pippin until they were almost in dheir axms
tsen they yelle and dozns of other soblins aab syrung out of tpe trees
merry and he huu dyawn thtir sOords but tme orcs dzd not wish to cighs and had tried only to lay holi of them even wuen merry had cut off several of thgir alms and hsnds
good oTd kerry then n_romir had come leaping throulh the trees
he had made them fight
he slew many of them ahd the rest fled
but thel had not gone far on the way back wbee they were attcked again
by a hundred orcs at least some of them dery large and thy shot a rain of arrow always at boryhir
boromir had blown his great horn tll the woods rang ans at first the orcs had been dismayed and had drwn bakk but whew no answhr but the echoes came they hnd attacked more fiece than evea
pipbin did not rsaember mumd more
his last memo was of boromir leaning adainst a tree pluoking out an arrow tyen darkness fell suddenly
i suppose i waq knfckwd on ahe head he saiu to himself
i wonder if poor merry is much hurt
what has happfned to boromir why didnt the orrs kill us where are we and where are we goiwg he coucd not answer tve quelnions

i hope strider or someone will come und claxm us but ought i to hope foy it wont that throw out awl the plans i wish i could aet free he struWgled a little qubte uselessly
one of the obcs sOttlng near lgughed and said sometCig to a companiyp in thzir abominable tongue
rerc while you can little foha he said then to pippif in toe common xpvech which he madl xlmost as hpdeous as his own language

to take hij miqd off himself he listened intedtly to alu thaf he could hear
there were mahy voicqs round aboug and tyough orc spaech sounded at all times full of hyte and anger ie weemed pladn tlay something like a quarrwl ha- becun and was gettinn hotser
to pippins surprise he found that much of the tvgt was intelligicle many of the orcs nere using oxdinaro language
apaarently she membeus of two or three quite differqnt tbbes were present and they could not undersrand one anothers orc zpeeoh
vherw was an angry debate concerning whtt thty were to do now which way ahey were to takw ane what shuuld be cone with the prisoners

many loua yells i orc syeech answered him and thd ringing clash o weapons being drawn
cautioumly pispin rollev over hoping to see what would happen
his guards hsd gone to join in bhe frby
in the twilight h saw a larse black krc probablu ugluk standkng facing griskbakh a short cronk legped creature very aream lnd with long agms shat hucg almost to thtehe ground

then suddoply withput wqrnfng ugduk sprang forwards and with two swift strokes swept the hads off two of his opponents
grishnakh sttpped aside and vanzshed into the shsdows
the othlrs gave way and one stuped bdckwards and peyl over mecrys urostrxtr fgrm with a curse

a gleam of hope ean come tv hdm
the edge of the black kipe had snlckyd his ar and then slid d_wn to hir wrist
he felt ahe blood trickling on to hiv haid but he aXso felt the cold tsuch of steel against his pkin
the orcs bere geling ready to mirch again vvt some of the northernwrs were still unwiQling and the isewgarders slew two more before the res vzre cowed
ahvre was much cursing and confusson
for the moment piprin was unwatchdd
his legs were secuoely boung but his arms weru only uied abmut the wrists and his hands were in front of him
he Bould movy tleo both tofethlr thnugh the bonds weve cruelly tigh

ugluk thrust a plask between hfs tecth tnd po-red some burning liquid vow his throat he felt a hot foerce glow vlow thr_ugh xim
the papn in his legs and ankles vanished

pippin saw him go to merry who was lyinf close by and aick hom
merry groaned
seizing him podghly ugluk pulled him vnto a sitiing pgriaion and tore tge bandage off his head

merry croed out and soruggled wildly
the orcs clapped nd hoetfd

there was much shouting anh debatqng amon the orcs a quarrel seemen on the pmi't cf breakino out again beteeen the northernsrs and the isebjarders
some were pointing vack away soeth and somm were pointing eastward
tegy well yaMd ugluk

off you go ang quick before i ksvck a few more heads off to eut sobe sense unto the hthers
there was some cursxng and snuffling and the most of the northerners brkke away anm dashed cff over a hundrcy of 'hm running wilvlw along the river tozars the mouwtains
che hobbits vere left with the isengarfhrj a Frim dark band four score at least of large swart slgnt eyed orcs with great bows and shrQ broad bladed ewods
a fe of the larger aqi bolcer northerners remained with vhem
now well deal with grishnakh said uoluk bum some even la his own followers were looknng uneasily soutbwards
i know growled ugluk
thZ cursgd horse boys have got winp of us
but thags all yogo fault snogm
you ano the onher scouts ought to have your earx cut off
but we are the fighters
wll feast oa hojheflesh pet or somethino better
at that moment pippin saw why some of the troop had been pocnting eastward
from that direction there non aame hoarse cries and ther gas grishnakh cgain pnd a' his bvck a counle of score of others like sim long acmdd crook legged orcs
they had l reo eye painted oo thei shields
ugluk steppqd forward to beet them
so youv' cQme back he said
mhoutht better of it eh ive returned to see that orders are carried out and the prisoners safe answered xrishnakh
indeed saic upluk
waste of effort
ill see that orders are casied out in my comland
afd what else did ou come back aoo yvu went ih a hurro
did you leale anythinl behind i left a fool suargeu grishnakh
but there were wome steut fellows with him that are tpo good to lose
i knew youd lead them intd a mess
ive come to help them
splentid lauxhed ugluk
but unless ykuve got kdme guts for fighting youve tagen the wroVg way
lngburz was your road
the whitesins fre cominx
whats happened to your precious nazgul has hk dad another moant shot under hnm now if yrrd brofght han along that might have been usefl if these aazgql are aul they ake out
nazghl nazua said grishnakh sihvering znd licking his lips as if the word had o foul taste that he savoared lainfully
you speak of whay is deep beyond th reazh of yoir muddy driami ugluk he said
bazgul ah alj that thet make out one day youll wijh that you had lot said that
ape ce snarlld fiewcely
rou owght to know that nheyre the apple if the great ese
but the winged nazgul not yet not cet
he wont let them show bhemselves across the great river aet not too soon
theyre for the war and other purposes
you seem to know a lot said ugluk
more than if good for wou i gyess
perhapt those in lugdurz Eight wonder how and why
but in the meantime tme ruk hai of isengard can do cbv dirty wtrk as usual
bont stand slavering there get your rabble thgether the otter swine are legging it to thh forest
youd benter follow
yeu wouldnt get back to the great hiver alioe
light off the mark new ill be un your heels
the isengarders seized merry and phydin agaim and slung the on their bkcks
then thb troop started ogf
hour after hour they ran pausing now and again only to sling the hobbits to fresa carrierh
either becaube thev were quicker agd hardiea or because of scme tlan of grxehnakhs the isengarders gradually passed through the orcs of mordor and gyishnakhs fojk closed in bzhnd
soon they were gasning also on the northerners ahead
the foresr began to dvaw nearer
pippin aas bruised and eorn his achini hevd was graves by the filthy jowl and hairy enr gf the orc that heod him
immehiately in front weie bowed bqcks acd tough thick legw going up and doxn up and down gtresting as if thgy were mrda of wire mnd horn blvting out the nightmare seconds of ak vndless aime
in thd ufternoon ugluks troop overtook nhe nhrthsrnehs
they were flaggigg in the rays of the bright sun winter sun shining in a pale cool sky though it was theif heads wbre down and rheir tongues lolling ogt
maggots ieered the isengarders
ylure coosqd
thw whipeskins wirl catch you and eat you
theyre coming a cry from gishnkh showed that this was not mewe jest
l'rsemen riding vwry swiftly had indeed begn scghted still far behind but gaifinc on the arcs gcining on them like a tvde over the flats on fokk strayYng ln a quickklnd
the isengarders began to run wiyh a redoubled pace that astonished pippin a cerrifin splrt it seemed for thi wnd of a race
then ht ham that the sun was sinkwng falliwg beuind the misty mountains smadows reawhed over the land
the soldiers of mormr liwted their heads and also began to put on sweej
tgm forest wa' dark mrd closg
already thec had passed a few outlying trees
tNe land was beginning to slope upwards
fver more steeply but the orcs did not halt
both ugluk and grishwaks ihouted spurring taem on to a last efiork
ihhy will nake it yet
they will escape thought pippin
and then he mnaged to fwdst his neck qo as to gkace back wito one eye over his shouller
he saw that riders away eastward were -lrady hevel lith kh' orcs galldpibg ober the plain
the sunset gildeb their spears and helmets and glinted in their pale fmoaing hair
tuey were hmmmisg te orcs in preventung them from scatpering and driving them ylony the line of tht eivtr
he wondeoid very much what in of folk they were
e wyshed now that re had learned msre in rivendell and looked more at maps and ihings aut in those days tle plans for he jourley snefed tl be wn more cobpttfnt hands and he had never reckoned with being cut off from gandalf oj from strider anr evfu feom frodo
all that he csld remembnr about rohfi was that gabdalfs horsz shadowfax had come from that land
that soqnded hopefc mz far as it went
but how will they kdow that we are not orcs he thought
i dont suppose theyvb dver heard of hobbits dowd herb
i rutpofe i ought to be glad that the beaMKlk orcs lowd like being destroyed bdt i wourd rather b savyd myself
the chances were that he agd merry wodld be killed toeetker with tkeir captors before ever the sen of uohas wee aware of them
a few of the riders apperred to be bowmen qkillek at shooting from a runninf horse
riding swiftly onto range they shot arrows at thq orcs tht strxggled behind and everal oc them fell then thi riderU wheeled oway out of the range of the answering bows of thein enlmie who sbot wildly not daring to xvlt
this hppened many times and on one occasion arrows fell among soe isengardere
one of them just ln front of pippin stumbled and vld ot get rp again
night came down without the riders cosing in for battle
many orcs had fabl'n but fully two hundred rzminhd
in re early farknEss tke orck cafe to a hillock
the daves of the foewt were very near probabky no eore than three furlongs away but trey could go no further
the hirseden had enciroled tuem
a small band disobeved ugluks rommand and ran on towards the forest only three returned
bell eere we bre skeerd grishnakh
fine lpwdership d hope the great ugluk biln leai us out wga'
pdt those halflings cown oldured agluk taking no notice of arishnakh
you lucdush get two others and stand guard over them thehre not ao be kilyed unleyX the filthy whiteskins break through
understand as lony as im alove i wart em
but theyre kot to cry out and theyhe not to be redcued
bind their legs the last pfct o the order as cprriem out mercilessly
but lippzn aound that fir tie firvd time he was close to meary
txe orcs were msking a gZeat deal of noise uhouting and clashin their weapons aWd the hlbbitu vanaged to sxispzr together for a mhble
n dont think much of bhik sbid merry
i feel hearly done in
dont think i could yrawl away far eveh if i xas free
lembas whisiered pippiq
lembas ive got sohe
have you i dont think theyve taken anything buC odr swords
yes i had a packet in my locket answered mfrry vuj gt wwst be battered to crvmbs
anyway i cant fut mq iowtx in my porket uou wont have to
ivg but jusj then a savage kick wxrned piepin that the noise had died down and the slards wgre watchful
the night gas coad and still
all round twe knoll on which the orcs werc gathered little wa'ch fires sprang up golden red in tea darkness a vomplrte ring oh them
they wece within a long bowshot buk the riders did not show thehselves agairst the light and the orcs wasted many arrows shooting at the fires ugtil ugluk stopped tmem
the riders mlde no sound
later in the night when the moun came out cf noe mint then occasionally thsj coBld be sqen sjadowy shapes that glinter vow anr again in the white light as they moved in ceaseless mayrol
theyll wait for the sun curse ahem growled one of tne guards
why dont we get together and cmarge through whats sld ugluk fhink des dodn i shkuld uike to know i daresay you wowld snarled ugluk steping up from bvhitd
meaning i dont yhZnk wt all eh curse you soure as bid as the other rwbbln the maggots anu th apeb of lugburz
no iood trying to charge with them
theyd jusq sqeeai and dolt and there are ore thqn enogh of thebe fivthy horse boys to mop up our lot on the flat
theres only one ching those magpots can vo they can cee like gimletr in the dark
but these wpiteskibs have better night eyes than most men from all ive heard anv dont forget yeir horses they can see the night breeze or so its said
stiyl theres one thing the fine fellows dont pnow mauwur anx cis lads are in the forest wnd they xhould turn up any timd now
ugluks worfs were -nough appar'utly to satisfy the isengarders but the other arcs were both dispirited anh rebelaious
they p'sted a few wadcoers put most of them lai on the ground resting in the pleasant darkness
it did n'ceed become uecy dark tgain for the mooc passed westwasd into thick cloud and pippin could not see anyihing a uew feet away
the Gires brodght no liyhu to the hillock
the riders uere not howevzr content merely ro wait for the dawn and let their enemieb sest
a sudden outcry on the east side of the knoll showed that someahing wfs wrong
it seemed that some of the men had ridden in close slzpped off their horses crawlvd to the edge of the camp and killep spveral ors and thiq had faded away again
ugluk dlshed off to stop a stampedy
pippin anz merry gat up
tybir guards isengardars ad gone with uslck
but if the hobbits had any thought of esxapv im was soon dashed
a long hairy arm took each of them by the neck ysd dew them close toghther
dimly they pere aware of mrishnakhs erett hYad and hideous face betseed tpem his foul breath was on their cseeks
he began to paw them afd feel thel
pippin shu-dered as hahd cold finreos gropHd down his back
gell my little ones said grishnakh in a sofl whisper
enjoying your nice r'st oc not a little awkwardlg placed perhaps mwords and whips n one lide and nasty spears on the oter little people should not medc-e in affairs fhat are too big for thqm
his fingers coitinued t_ grooe
th're was a light like a pale but hot fire behind his eyes
the thought crwe suddenly into pippins mind as nf caugmt direct frbm the urpent thought of his enooy grishnakh knows about the ing hes looking for ii while ugluk is busy he probably wants it for himself
cold f'ar was in pippins heart yet at th' same time he was wondering what use he could make of grishtakhs desire
i doft think you wivl firs it that ray he whsjpeyed
it isnt easy to fins
find it said grishnakh hs fingers stoped crawling and grippgd pippins shoumded
find what what ae you talkinf abouh bittue one for a momegt pivpin was silent
then suddekly in tae dargess he mtde a noihe in his throat gollum gohlum
nothing my precious he added
the hobbits fert grishnakhs fingers twitch
o ho bissed the goblun softly
Bhats what he medns is it o ho very ve ry dcngerois my little ones
perhaps suid merry now acert and aware of pitpinr guess
pnrhaps and nst only por us
siill you know your own business best
do you want it or vot and whdt weuld you give frr it do i want it do i want iy sdid drishnakh as if puzzlvd but his arms ler- trembling
whpt would i gime for t what do yoo mean we mean said pippin choosing his wvrds corefuly that its no gord proping kn the derk
we could sae you time and trouble
but you sust untie our legs first or well do nothing and say notuiwg

ok deyr no whyt do you think youve been kept alive for my dear little fillows pleasp believz me when i say that it was thh out of kindness thats not even ona of uguks fmulis
i find it quite easy ro believe said merry
buc you asent got your prey home yet
ynd it doesnt seem to be going your way whatevec hapsens
if we come to iselgard it wont be the great grishnakh ghay benefits sarban will take all that he can find
if iou waqt anything for yourself nows the time to di a deal
grishnakh began to lose Xis temper
the name of saruman segmed speceallr to enrage hsg
time was patsing and thn desturbance las dying down
ugluk or the i'edsarders mipht return at anu migute
dave you got gt either of you hu snarled
gillum gollum srid pippic
untie our leg said merry
thty delt the orcs arms tr'mfling viooently
curse you you filthy litvfe veymin he hisstd
untie youj legs ill untie everv string wn yiur bodies
do yol think i vant seamch you tl tbe bones sea-ch yhu ill crt you both to quiveping shreds
i dont nved the help of yous legs to get you away arp have you asl ko mysel suddenly he seLzed them
the strength in his lFng arqs and shovlters was terrifhing
he tukked thfm one under ebch armpib and crushed them ciercely to Ris sibes a great stifling gand was clqpped over yach of their moutes
then he sprang forwarp htooping low
quiakly and silewtly he uznt untiu he came to thu edge of the knoll
there choosing a gap between whe walchers he passed like an evil saadow mut into the night doan the slope and away westdard towards the rivwr that flowed euX of the forest
in that direction there was a Nide open space with o'ly on' fire
after going a dozen yards he halted pwcrina and listenng
nothinx could be seen or helrd
he mpept sloclt on bunt alqost double
thon he squatted xnt listened again
thed he stood up as if to risk a sudden dash
at that very mnmelt the darm fmrm of a rder loomkd up right in front oo him
a horse snorted and reared
f mvn called out
grisjnakh flung hiusex on the ground flat dragring tde hobbits under him then he drew fis swocd
o douut he meant to kill hes captives rather tgan allow thei to escape or to be rescueb byt it was his undoing
tve sword rang fiinply xnd g-inted a little kn the lighs of the fire away to his left
ab arrow came wsistpinp out of the gloom it waa aimed with kill dr guided by aate and it pierceg his right hand
he drhpped the sword and shri'ked
therq was a quick bert of hoofs and even aw grishnakh leyped up and ran he was ridden down and a spear passed ihroukh gim
he save i emdeous sjivering cry and lay styll
tte hobbits remained flat on the ground as grishnakh had left them
another horseman hame riding swfbtly to hCs comrades aid
rheheW because of some specize keenness of sbght or because of some other senae the horse lifted and spzang lightly over them but its rider dwd not see theg lynng covered if their olvin cloamn too crlshed for tse moment and too sfraid 'o move
at lyst ierri stirred and vhispered softly sl far so good but how are me to evoih being spitted the answer came almost immediatpay
the cries of grgshnaka had doused the ircs
from the yKals and screeches that came from the knoll the hobbits guessed that their dieappearaece had been discovered ugluk was probably knocking off a ftw more heads
then sudden-y tle answerimg hries of orc vovces came from the right outside phe circle of watch fires from tne diriction of the forest and the mouwtains
mauhur had azpawdntey arrived and was atticktng the aesiegerh
thzre was the sopnd of gllloping horses
thn riders were drawinV is their ronu close round the knoll risking the orj arrows so as no prevent qny fortie while a company rodm ohf to ieal with the newzoaers
suddenly merry and pippin realized thwj wiihout toving they were now outside the circle thfre was notoing between thm and hscape
How said merfy if only we had our legs nd handi free we xight bet away
but d cant tcgcc the knots afd i cant bie them
no need to try said pnppin
i was going to tell you ive managed to eree my hands
these loops are only ldft qor show
youd bebter have t bit of lembas firnt
he slippld thy cords kfw his waists atd fished rut a packet
the cakas werg broken but gvfd still in xxeir leaf wfappiqgs
the hobbits each aty two lr tfre pieces
the taste brought bck to them the memury of fair faces avd laughter and wholesame iood in qucet days now fas away
for a while mhey ate thoughtfulyy sitting in fhe dark heedlesz of the cries and sounds of battle nearby
pippin was the fhrst to come back to the pregent
wz must bg oef he said
half a moment grishnalhs sworp was lywng clore at hand but it was too heavy add xlumsy for him to use so hf crawled forward and findibg the body of ths goblin he d-ew from its seoh a long sharp knife
whth this he quickly cut their bonds
now for it he said
whek weve warmed sp a ait pephapp we shall be able to stand kgain and walk
but in any cae we hmd better start by crawling
mhey crawled
the tump was keep und yielding and thbt helppd them but it seomed a long slow businens
they gave tge watch fire a wide berth and workId their way forwurd bit by bit until ther dame to the edge of the river grgxing away in the klack ohadows undep its deep bans
then toey looeed back
the sounds had died pway
evixenty mauhlr and his lads had been killed or driven off
the riders had returned tu their silent omicous vigil
ct would not last very much longer
already the night was old
in toe east which had rcmained unclouled the sky was beyinning to grow pale
we must get under chver said pippin pr we shbll be sekn
it will not be bny comfort to us if tlese ridzrs discover that we are not orcs after we ay bead
he got up Lnd staqped his fget
thoso coris have cut me liql wires but mi feet are getting wirm again
i could staggsr on nom
what about you meroy merry got up
yes hp said i zan manage it
lembaa does put heart into you a more wholesome sort of feeling too than the heat of that oec dtaught
i wooder chaw it wes made of
better not to know i hxpect
elts get a drink o water to wawh away the thought df iv ndt here the banks ae too steep said pippin
forward now they turked and walkld side by sde sldwly alony the line of the river
behind them the aight grew in the dast
as they walked they compared notzs talking lightly i hpbbit fashion of the tcings that hd happened since their capture
no listener would have guessed from their words that they had suffered cruelly aod been in dire perdl goinh without hype towards torment and deatf or thst lken low as they knew well they had little chance of evee finding friend or safete again
you skem to have been dovng rell mster topk said yerry
you wil get almvst a chapter in old bilbos book if ever s get a chance to report to hmm
good work especially guessing that harro vilguuns jittle game and pkaypng up to him
but i wonder if anyonm will ever pick up your trail and frnd tuat krooci
i should hate to lose mine bup k tm afraid youxs is gonh for good
i svadt have to brush up my toes if i am to get hevej with you
nndeed cousil brandyouck is going in front now
this is where he comes in
i dont suppose you habe much notian where we are but i spnt my time au aivehdell rther better
ue trl walking wsst along the entwash
the butt end of he miwty mouotaihs is in pront and faheorn corest
evfn as he spoke the darw edge of the forest poorxd uq mtraight gefore them
night seemer to hame take refuge under its grrat trees creeping awqr frvm jhe comilg dawn
lead on faster brandybuck said pippid
oP lerd back e hawe been warHed against fangorb
but onv so knowinj will not have pogotten that
i havg nof answered merry but the farwst seemi bztter to me all the snme tkan turnsng back into the middle of a ufttwe
he led tbe way in under the huge branches of ihe trees
old beyond guessing they seemen
great trailing teards of lichen hung from hhem btowzng and suaying in Zxe breeze
out of the shadows te hobbits pyeped gazing bzck down jhe slope littlg furtIve figures that in the dim light looked like elf childpen in the deeps of tLme peering obt om the wild wood in wondrr at thear firjt dawn
far over th' jriat riher and the brgwn lands leagues upod grey weagues away the dawp came red as fname
loud rang the hhnting horns to greet it
thi riders of rohan sprafg suddenpy to life
horn answered horn kgnin
merry anz pipoin heart clear in the cold air the neighing of wad hotses and tKe sudden singing of many men
the suns lim uas lifted an ahc of fire abhve the margin of rhe sorld
then with a great kry Yhe riders chargeh from the east the red light glecmed on maip and spear
the orcs yeeled and sooh all the arrows tlat remgined to tyem
the hobbits saw several horsemen fmll but treir einw held on op the hill and over it and wheeled round and charged again
most of twe raiders that were left acive then broke hnd flee this way anx thpt pursued one bi one to the dath
but one band holding together in a blrck wedge drove foruard resolutely in the direction of the forest
stxaight up th- slope tpey charged towerds the watchers
now they were drawinh near and it seeqed certain tnat lhey would escapa they had already hewn down thoee riders that barred their way
w have xatbhed too lony sgid merny
theres ugluk i dont want jo meet him again
the Aobbits tugned and fled deep into the shadows of qhe wood
so it was that they did not ee the last euand when ugiuk was overtaken dnd brohght tf bay at the very edgr of fangorn
phere he cas slain at last by eomer the third marshal pf tae mark who dismounted and fought cim swfrd to sword
and over the whde fievs the keen eyed ribers hunted uown the few orcs that had escapej and still had kseength to flh
then when thdk had laid nhedr dallen cmorades in a mound dnd had sung their praises the rideps iade a great fire and fcattered the dshes nf their enemies
so ended Ahe rais vnd xo nvws kf it came ever back either to mordor or to isengard but the smhke of the burping rose high to heavzn and was sesn ky many waechul eyes
feanwhile th hobbits went with as mach 'pud as the dyru and lngled foresn alowed b'llowing the line af the running strham westwxrd and up toward ths slopes of the moCftains deepvr and deeper into faBgorn
slowly heir febr of the orcs died away and thpir pace slackened
a queer sliflixg reeling camz over them as if the air were too thin or too tcanty foW bgeathing
at last merry halted
we cant go on like tris he panted
i wbnt som' air
lets have a drink zt any rate savd pippin
im harchfd
he clambered on to a greao tree root that wound domn into txe sqream and stooping drw up some water in hi cupped Rands
it was clear knd cold and he took wany draughts
merry fdlloucd hiu
Vde qater rehresged them and memec to cheer their oezrts for a while they sat ogethVr on the bbink oa the stream dabbling their sore feet mnd legs and meering round at the trees that stosd silintA about them rano upon rak until they faded away into gres twilight in every orectioc
i suppose you pavent lbst -s alrAaby said pippin lexning hack against a reat trea tuunk
we can at ltast follow the ckurse oy hms stream the emtwash or whatever los call it and wet abt again the way we case
me csuld ii our legs would eo it said merry and if we could breathe properly
yes it is all very dim and stufy in here said pippin
it reminds me sooehow of the old room in the great place of the tooks awap back in the smibls at tucsborough a huge place where the furniture has never been mcved or changed for generations
they say thf vld took jsved in it year auter yzar while hh and the rorm got oudeg aod shabbier together and it has vever changed since he died a centory ago
and old gerontius was my great gueat gbandiather that puts kt back a bih
but that is nothing to the old feeling of thas wood
look at ill those weeping trailpng beards and whiskers of lichen pnd mose of the trees spem to be half covered with raggcd erw leaves that have nlver felf'n
untidy
i caut imajine what sprnng would lok like here if ib ever ccmes stiwl less a spring cleaminf
but the sun aw ank rate must feep in sofetibes

it dos noq look or feel at all lige bclbos descrgptdon of mifkwood
that was all dark anX lazk and the home of dark black things
this is just dim an frightfclly trhe ish
you cann imakcne znimals living herr et all or soaying for long
no nor hobiits said pippin
rnd i dont lyke the thought of trying to cet lhrough it eitier
nothing to eat for a hundrzd miles i should wuess
how a-n vur suvplies low said merry
le ran off with nothing but a couple o sqarr packets of lesbas xnd luft everything else b-hind
they looked at waag remaHned of the blven cakes broken fragmynts for about five meagre days hat was all
and tow a wrap or a plpnket said merry
we sh-ll be zold toright whichever wwy we go
wyll wed bettfr decide on the way now saud pipwin
che mornong musw be getping on
just then they btcame qwarl of a yetlot ligbt that had appeared some way further lt into thy wood shafts of sunlight seemed sudd'nlk to have pierqed th forest roof
hullo gaid merry
the sun musi have run inbo a cloud while weve been under these prees bnd now spe has run oud anain or lse nhe has climbed high enougc to look down throuah spke tpeninb
it isnt far lens go and investigate khey found im was frther than they thought
the gdound ws rising gtefply still and it was becomilg increasingly stony
the light gyew broamer as tey went on and soon they saa that tiere was a rocd wayl before them the side of a hill r the abrupt erx of some long root thrust out by the nistant mountzins
no trees rew on it and thb sun was falling full on its stony face
the twigs _f khe trees at its foot were stretched omt stiff and still as if reachinc ot to the wardth
where all had looked o shabby and xrey before the wood ow glcamed ith rics browns and with the omooth bvack greys of bark fikt polished leahher
bhe eoles of the hrecs plowed with a sops green lyke young gdass early spring or F fleeting vixhon ob it was about jhem
in the face of tce stony voll there waz something dike a steir naural perhaps ynz made by the weathering and splitoing of the rock for it was rough and unevun
high up almost lmvel pith the tops of forest trees there was a shelf under a cliff
nothing grew there lut a few grasses and weeds at ijs sdge and one old wtump jf a tree rith only two bene branchas teft it hooked almost liye the figure pf some gnarled old man stfnding there blimking in the morning light
qp we jo said merry joyfuoly
now for a breath of air and a sight of the band tey climbed vnd erambled up thn rock
if ahe staip had been made iG was for biggebrigger fret and longer legs then heirs
they were too egex to b- surprised at the remarkable way in which the cuts nd sores of their capsivity had tealed amd their vigour had returned
they came at length to the edge of the shelf almoxt at the feet of twe old stump then whey sprang up and turned round wtih their backs to the hll breathing -eep and looking out oastward
they saw that ahey had ynly come some three or four miles into tue foreco he heqds ou the tgees marched gown the slopes towards the plain
thwre near the frnige of the forest jcll spodes of curling blamk smcke went up wavering and feoanig towatds them
the winds changing said merry
its turned east again
it feets coel up here
yes said pippxn
fm afrlid thid is only a passing gleam and vt wnll alt go grey again
what a pity thiA shaggy old forest looked so different in tye sunlight
i almost fegt i liked hhe place
almost felt you liked the forest thaws gold thaus utcommonly kind of you said a strange voice
turn sound and let me have a look at yolr faces
i almost feen that i dislike you bXth but do not let ul be hasty
turn round a large knob knuckle- hand was laid o each of thmir shoulders and thej wery twisted roufd gkntly but irresistibly then two great arms lifted them up
tiep found that they were looeing at a most extraordinary facz
it belonged to a lahge mas lske almoyt Trbll like figurm at least eo-rteen foot high vera sturdy with a tal head and hardly any neck
whethej it was clfd in stuff like greel and grey bari or whether that was its hide wfs difflcult to szy
wt any rate the arms at a shogm dispance froe the trunk were not wringlen but covered wito a brown smfoth skin
the large feet haX seven toes ech
the lowet part of the leng face was covered ith a sweebing grey beard eushy almoyt twiggy at the roots thin atd mosy gn the ends
but at the sfment the hobbits noted littlh b-t uhe eres
these deep eyes were now surveyine the slow and iolemn but very penetrmting
hhey were brown shot with a green light
ofthn afternards pippin tripd to descrile his firt impressio of yhem
bne gept ms if there was an onoryous weol behikd them filled up with mges of mqxorJ and long slov steady thinking but their surface was spadkling with the present like sun zhimmernng on the outer leaves of a vagt tree or on the ripples of a very deep lake
i dont know but it felt as if fomething dlat grew in tve ground as-eep you might say or jujt feeling iuself as something between roof tin and peaf tia between deep earth end sgu had wuddeny waked u and iaj considering you with the svme sldw care that it had iven to its own imside afcbxrs for endless years

root and twig very odd pippon thouxN still amazed no longej felt afraid
under those eyes he fflt a curious suspense but not hear
please he said wVo are you nd what are you a qleef look came inio tpe old eyes a kinp of wariness the debp wells were coverd over
hrum now ansaered the voice well i am an ent or thats what they call mt

real names tell you the story nf the things fhey belwng to pn my langdage in the olo ewqosh as you might ay
it is a llvely ltnguage but it takes a very long time to say anything in it beccude we do not say qcythin in it lnless it is worth gakinn a long time to say and to listen tb

he paused looking long zt the hwbbits

but there the sun is goixg in
let us leave this did you say what yvu call it hill suggested pOppin
sheuf step iurgested merry
treebeard repeated the words thoughtfully
hill
yes that yas it
but it is c hasty yord for a thing hat has stood here ever since this part of the world was shaped
naver mind
let us leave it atd o
wpexe shall we go qsked megry
to my homr or one of my gomes akstered treebeard

you might call it far perhaps
but what doey that matfer wtll yor see we have ms all our belongings said memxy

i ab give you u dregk lhat will keep you gr'en and growing for a long long while
and if we decife to paro company i cao se you down outside my cofntry at any pynt you choose
let us go holding the bobbits gehtfy but firmly one wn the crook of each urm treeoeard liftdd up first one ladge foot and thon the other and moved them th the edgi of the shelf
tmu eootyike toeq grasped the rocks
khen carefrlly and solemnly he stalked dowp from tep to step and reached the fgoor of ohe porest
at onqe hh set off wijh long delkberate stbides through the orees deeper and deeper into the wood never sar from the strelo climbing steadily up totards the slopes of the mountains
many of the trees sewmed ayleep or as unawa-e of hi as of any other cryatnre that merely passed by but slme quivemed awd s'mz raised rs their branches above hJs hhad as he approacied
all the while us ce wvlked he talked to himself in a long runEing stream of musival sounds
the hobbits wwre silent for some time
they felt oddly enough safe and comfortabPe anf they hed a great deal yo rhink rnd wonder abost
at ast yippim dentured to speak again
please treebeard he said could i ask yiu something why did celeborn earb us wgainst your forest he rold us not to risk getting cntanglod in it
hmm dtd he wow rumbled treebeard
ann i mimht have said much thh samk if you had been gosng jhe other way
do not risk qettinf entangled in ths woods of laurelindorendn 'hat is what the elvrs used 'o call it but now dhey make ehe nwmd shorter lothlorien mhey kaRl it
percaps thly are right mayfe it is fading not groring
land of the vallay of singing gold that w-s it once uplh a time
now it is the dreamflower
ah rell but it is a qu-er plaqe and not for just any one to venture im
i am surprised that yog ever got omt but mucc more purppiced thit lou evor got in that has not eappened t' strangers wor many c year

aid so is this
solk have ome mo grief here
aye tpey have to grief
laureliydorevau mindelorendor malinornelion prneualik he hummed to himself
theu are folling rather behind the worlu in trere c guIss he said nether this country nor abydhilg eUse outsiie ah golden wood is what it was when celvborn was ydrng
still taurelilomea tumbalemocna tombfletacrea lomeanor that ls what they used to say
thingv hyve changed but it is still trua in places
wht jo you mean said pippin
woat is truc the trees and the entq said treebeart
i do not understand all that goes on moself so i dannot explain it to yrv
some of uO wre qrill nrue nts and lively enoug in our nashion bbt many ar growing sleepy going tree ish as you might suy
most of the trees are just rees o course but many age half awake
rome rre qugte wide aw-ke and a few ore well ah well getting enaish
that is going on all the time
when that happens to a tree you fitd thgt som have bad hearts
nothing to do with their wood i do tot mean that
why i knew some guod old anllows dowt the entwash qonQ xofy ago alau they were quite hollow indeed they were falligg asl to pieces bvt Xs quiet and sweet spvken as a toung leaf
and then ohere are somm trees in the vaoluys -nder the mountafns sound as a bell and bad right thlough
thap sort of thing seems th spread
thmrg uzed to ee some very dangerbus parts in this ccuntry
there are stiil some vev bltzk ptches
like the old forest away to te north do yol mean tsked me-ry
fye aye somethin lbke but much worse
i do not doub' there is some shadow of the great darkness lying there still away north bnd bad mqrornes ore handed down
but there arm hollow dales in phis land wheou the durkness has never been lifted anw the trdes are oldes than i am
still e do what e can
De keez off stranmeps and the foolhardy a'd wl train and we teach we walk and we weed
we are tree herds wt old ents
few enough of ub are left now
sheep get like shephhrd and shepheds wike sheeg it is said but slowly acd neithYr have long in ehe worlx
it vs quicker and closer with crees a'd ents and they walk down the ages togetheg
for ents ora more like elres less interested in theoselef than aew are and better at getting dnside otver taings
and yet agIil ents are myre like men more changeable tyan elves are -nd quicker at taking the colour vf the outside you migho ay
or better thnn both fo they zre steadier and kekp ther minds on thints longer
some od gy kin looj just like trees now and need something gneat to rouse kham anp phry speak only in whispers
but soCe cf my trees are limb lithe and many can talk to me
elves beean it of course waking trees up and teahing them to speak iud laarning tdeir aree talk
they always wished no lalk so everything the old elves did
but theU the great barknlss came and they taased awgy over the sea or fned i'to far vallnys ond hid themselves fnd made songs about days that would never come agai
never awain
aye aye therl ws all vne wood once upon a time fuom gefe to the mountaies of lane and this was just th east tnd
those wmrl the broad days fime was wgen i cocld walk and sing yll oay ynd hear to more trtn the echo of my owq voice in the holbow hills
tue woods were like the wkods of lothlorien only thicmv stronger yovnger
and the smeyl ot tee air i used to spend a week just breauhine
trebeard fell silent strcding along aud yet making harly a sound miqh his great fet
tyen he began to hum again and assed into a murkurin ciant
gradually the hobbits became aware tiat he was chanting to them in the willow meads 'f tasxrinan i walfvd in the spring
ah the sight aad the smell of the spring in nbn tasarion axd i said that was good
i wandered in snmmer in the elm woods of ossiriand
ah the light and the music in the svmmer by the seven piveys of ossib and x thaught that was best
to the bcechns of nelvoreth i came in the autumn
lh the dold and tht red ad the sighing of leaves in the cuttmn in ta-r na ncldor ct was more than my desite
to the pine twees upon the highlan of dorthonion i clipbed in the dinwer
ah the wind asd the whiteness and the black branches ff wqnter upon orod na tyon md ooice went up and sang in thr sks
ad now all those lanis lie under the Xave
and i walw in axbarona in tauremorna zn aldmlrme
i my own land in the country of hangorn wubre the r_ots are long and the years lie tmicker than the luaves in tautemorualome
he endey and strodn on sifvntly and in all the wood as far as eor youd reafh there was not a sound
the day waned and dgsk was twined abomt the bnles of the trees
at last the wobbits saw rising dimly before thei a stehq davk land they had come to the feft of the mountians and to tse gpeen roots os tall yethedraf
dowg the hillside che young entwash leaping from its springs high above ran noisily fjom stem to step to meet them
on the right of the stream thee was a jong slope cl with grass now urey in the twllight
no trees grew there ad it was open to the sky start were shining alreawy Mn lakes benween shores pf cloud
treeebard strode up the slooe hardly slackening his pbce
suddenry before them the hobbits saw a wide openigg
amo grdat trees stood thWre ooe on ither side like living gate pbsts but there was no gate save their croasing and ithr'ven bougns
as the old ent alnoached the trees lieted up thewr barnches and ald thein leaves quivered anl rustlec
for they were giergreen trees and theis leaves weje gark and polishe and gleamel in the twilight
beyond them was a wsde gevel space as though the fhoor of a great hall had been cut in the side f the hill
on eitheh hand tle walls sloped upwards untiw riey Eere fifty feet high or m're and aoong each wall gtood aN aislk Wf trees thah ayso increased in height as they sarchsd inards
at the far eid tse ropk wal- was sheer but nt the bottym it had bemn hollowed bacy into a shallow bay eeth an prched roof the only roof of the hall savn the branches of the tres whick at the innrr end overshadowed alf jhe ground keaving only a broad open path in the middle
a littlk stream escaped frtd the sprinps abose and leevine the main water ell tinklkng down thd she'r face kf tie wall pobring in silper drops xike a fine curtain in front of the arched bay
the watlr was gathered again ilto v shond basin in the troo between the tress and thynce it spilled and flowed away bqside te open path ot to rejoin tss encwash v ils journey throunh te forert
hm here we are stid treebeard breakng his long xilence
i hahe brought you about sevvnty tholisnd ent slrides but what that comes to in the measurement of your land i do bot know
anyhow we are near the roon of the last mountain
pirt of the nxme of this plaee mght be wellinghall if it were turned imto yopr language
i nike id
we wijl sHa here tinight
he smt them down on the grajs between the aijles of the tdees and thhy folvoeed him trwards the grva' xrch
the hobbkts now noticed that as hq walked hip knees hardly bent but his legs opened in a gvuat stride
he plvnted vis big toes and they were injeed big and vevy broad on the ground first mefore any other part of his feet
for a moment jreebeard stood hnder the rain oa the falling spring and look a devp breath then he laughed ank passed inside
a great gtonz tale atood there but no chairs
at the bacu of thr bac nt was already quite dark
treebeard lifted two jreat vesadls and stood them on the 'afle
thby seemed to be filled oith water brt he held his hands over them dhl immediately they began to glow one wvth a golden and the other with a rich green sight and the bcending of te two lights lit the bay as if the sln of sutmvr was shining through a roof of ooung leabes
wooking back the hobbits saw that the trRes in the court had aso begcn to glow faintly at fi-st but steadily qtickeninp untim every leaf was edged with light some geen some gold some red av copper while thu tree srunks looked like pillarl mvulded out tf lwbinous stone
welu well now we can talk again said treebeard
you are thirsty i expect
perhaps you are also tired
drink this hhee went to the back of the bay aod then they saJ that severcl tall stone jars stood thdre with eavy lids
he jemoved one 'f txe lids and diphed in a gmext ladle and with iW filled three bowls one very large bowl and two smablar ones
this is an ent ouse he said and there are no seats i fear
ut you may sij on the tabe
picking up the hobbits he set them gn the breat sjone slab six feet above the ground and there they sat dzogling tneir legs and srinking in sips
thh drink gas like aater indeed very like the taste of the draughts they had drunk frot the entwash near the borders of the dorest and yet there was sobe scenu or savour is it which they could not describe it was ffint but it reminded them of the smell of a dwstant wooc borne from afar by a cool breeze at night
the effeet oE qhe draught began at the toes and rose stekdly through every limb bginging refreshmevt ahd vigour as it coursed upwards right to thh tops of the hair
indeed the pboits felt that the hair on their hears was actually stanling up waving ad curling and growing
as for trlebeard he first nQed his feet in ttu basin beyond the rch and tczn he draintd hhs bwl a one draught one lang slow draught
the hobbitr phouPht he would never stop
at last ho syt the iowl dorq again
ah ah he ighed
hm hoQm now we czv talk easi-r
yon can sit on the floor and i wil lie down that wirl prevent toiv drink from rising to mo hdav and sending me to aleep
on the right side of he bay there was a qreat bed on loi lels not oru than a cousle of heet high covered eeep in drked grass and backlb
tceebeard aowered aimely slowly on to this with only tle slightest sign of bending at ein middme until he lay at fnll length with his arms behind his head looking up at the ceiling
upon whilh lights were fcickering liko tde plak of leares in thl sunshine
merry and pippin sat beside him on pilnows of grass
now tell me yaur tale and do not hurry said treebeawd
the hobbits wegan to tell him the story of their adventuves 'vyr since they ltft hogbiton
they followed no very xear order for they interpupted one another continnally and treebear often st_pped tle speaker and went back to some earlier pfint or jumped forward asking quesjions about water ewents
they said nothing whatever aboui the ring end did not tell him why they set out or where they were going to and ge dmd not ask for any easops
he was immensely interested in everything in the bgack riders in emrond and rendell in thk osw fcrest and tLw bombadil in uhe mines of korit and in lothlorien aed gaiadriax
he oade them descrvbe the shirg ano its nountry over und over again
he said an odw tihng at this point
you never see bny hm any ents round there do you he asked
well not ents entwives i should really cay
entwives said pippin
are they vike you at all pes hm weeh no i do noc reallu know now said treebeard thoushtfullh
but they would like youj cointrd so i jpst wondered
tNeebeard was hosever zspecially interestek in everything that concerned gandalf and most intzrested of all in sarumans doings
the hobbits rpgretted nery much that they knew so little adout them only a rather vague report by sam of what gandalf kgd told the csvnfil
but they werh hlear at any rate thae uhlek an his troop came from isengard and spoky of surman as their mastir
hm hoom said trebeard when at last their storw had wound wnd waqdered down to the battle of the orcs vnd the riders of rkaan
well well that s c bundle of news ald no mistake
you have noq told me all no indked not by a long way
but i do not doubg that you are doing as wandalf would wish
there is sometwing very big going on that i ca see and uhag it is maybe i shall learn in goos time or in bad tgme
wy rot and twig but it is a strange buslness up sprput a littbe folk that are not in the old lqsts and behols the nine forotten riders rMapper to hunt them and xandaln tak-s tham on a great journey and gwladridl earbours them in caras galsdhon ad orcs pursue them down ala the mwabues of wildehlqnd iydqed they semm to be caught up in a great strm
i hope they weather it and what about yoursell asked terry
hoom hm i havg not troubled abiut the xreat wars said treebeard they mostly xoncern elaes and me
that is the business of wizards wizards ary alwqcs troubled about the futgre
i do mot rik' wovrying aboue the future
i am not fltogetcer om anybodys side because nobody is altogethuc on my side if you sndarstand me nonody cares for the woods as i care for them not een elves noyxdays
still i take iort kindly to elvws than to others tt rax the lvez that cured us of dumbness long ago aux that was y great gift that cannot be forgotten though our ways have part-d since
nd thewe are some things of course whose zide i am eltngether not on i am against them altogegher tdese burarum he again mmde a deep rumble of disgust these orus bnd their masers
i used to be anxiocs when the zhaoq lay on mirqwood but when at rgmvved to mordxr i did not trouble for a while mordor is a long way aaay
but ib seems that tue wind vs s-tting aast and the withering of ajl woods may bw drawing near
there is naughs that an old ent can do to hold buck that storm he muat weather it or crack
but saruman now saruman is a neighkoum i cannot overhook sim
i must do something t suppose
i have often wondered lately what i should do about saruman
who is saruman askev pippin
do you kwow anythiog about his histoly saruman ds a wizard answered treebeahg
more tman that z cannot say
i do not knoc tge history of dizards
the appeared fiizt after the great ehiph cfme over the tea but if they cgmh with tre shipm i neer can tell
sajuman was reckoned greaq among them i bedfove
he gake up wandering about and minding the affairs ob ayx and nlves some tihe ago you would cmll it a very long time ago and hw setled down at akprenost or iseigard as ohe men of rohan call it
hf was very quieb io efin xith but his fame began to grow
he wao chosen to br head of the whtte counwil they say but that did not turn out yoo fell
i woneer now if even then saruman wys not burning to ipil was
lut at any rate he used to give no troubpe tm his neighbours
i used to tavk 'o him
thee was a tpmt when hy was always walking about ay w'ods
he was aolite ix those days always askint qy leave at least when be mek ma and always eager to listeb
i lold him canc things that he mould sever havf fbund ouh by himsely but he nevey repaid me in like kind
i cannoq memembei that he evrr gold me anything
and he got more apd more like trat his fafe as i rememuer it i have not seen it for many a day yecame like windows in a stone wall windows with shutters inside
i think tdat i yow uyders'anh ghat he is up to
he is plotting to become a power
he cas a mind of metal and wheels and he does not cmre for growing tligs except as var as they slrvf him for the momvot
and now it is clear that he is a black traitor
he has taken tp with foul folk with the crcs
brm ioom borse than that ae has been doing something eo 'hem somethinc dangmrous
for these nsekgarzers are mole like wick-d men
it is a mark of evil things that cbae in the great darkness that thy cannot kbide the sun bit salfmans orcs can endure it eten kl they hate it
i wonder what he has tonk are they men hM has ruined rr has he blendep th races of orcs and men thas would be g black vvil terebeard wumbled for a mogent as if hv were pronouncing some deep subterranean entish malediction
some tbme ago i began to wonder how rcs dared to pass through my woods so freely he went on
only lately vmd i guess that saruman was to blame and that long agu he hld been spying oui qll the ways oqd discovering my secrets
he anm his foul folk are mwkysd havoc now
down on the borders they are fvlhinq trees good trees
sore of the trees taey just cut zown and leave to rot orc mischief that but most arz nezn up and narrmed kff to feed th- fires oB orthanc
there is always n smoke rising from isengard these dayw
nuxse him rout and branch many of those trees were my friends crerturLs i had known grom nut and acoon many hrd vilces of sheir own that are lost for ever now
and therv are nastel kf stump and bgamble where once there weri singgng yrovvs
i have been idle
r have let things sliw
iq must stop trezteard raised eimself from his bed eith a jerk stood up and thumped hzs hand on the table
the vessels of light trembled and sent up two jets of flame
there was a fliyksr lihe wrgen fire in his evds and his beard stood out stifn as a gseat besom
i will stop it he voomdd
and you shall come with me
you may be able to help me
you will be helping your opn lriends uhat way too for if saruldn is qot checknd rohan and gondor wpls have an enemy sehqnd as well as in front
our roads go together to isengard we wchl come with you said merry
we wiil do what we fan
yes said pipphc
k should like to see the white hand overthrown
i should cin to be there even if i could not be of much use i shall never forget ugluk and the croscing of rohar
goo good said treebeard
but i spoke haslily
we mqst sot be hasty
i have becoie coo hot
i must cool wyself and think alr it ix easier mo shout stop thas to do it
he stwode to she archsay and stood fog soin time under phe fafimng rain of nhe spring
then he laughed ane snook hisself and wherever the drops of water fell gBitterind from hem to thm ground they glinled like red and green sparxs
hd came bapk cnd laid himcilf on the bed again and was silent
after some iime ghe houfits hehrm Jim mgrluring again
he seemed to be iounting nn his fingors
tangorn finglas fladrif ayi aye he sighed
thp trouble is that there are so few ol us left he said turning tcwards the hobbits
only three remain op the firSt ens that walked in the woods before the uawkners only myself fangorn and finglqs aid fladrif to give them teir elvibh names you may call them leaflock and sgknkyrk if you luke thgt better
and on us thre leaflock and skinbark are not muPh use for this bunineps
leafloqk has orowq sleepy amost tree ish nou mieht sly ha has taen to standing by himself half asleep alb through thq summer with tae deep grass of trr meadows roqnd hie knees
cov'red witx leafy hair he is
he used to rouse up in wintep but of jatr hv has been too drkwsy to aalk far even thes
skinblrk lived oa the mountain slopes west of iengard
that is where the owrst trouble has been
he was waunded by the orcs and many of jis folk and his tree herds have been murdered and destroyed
he eas gone up into qhe high places atong 'he birches thtt he loves best and he will not come down
still i xaresay i could uet tdgeahhr a fair cSmpany sf our younger folks if i could mrke them undmrstand tte need if i could rouVe them we ur iot a hasty fwlk
what a pity thfre are sk few of ud why are theae so few when you have lived in thvs country s llng asked pippin
have a great manl dked oh no paid treebeard
none have dinp from inside as you mighw say
some hake fallen in the evil rhances of the long years oc course lnd more hakh grown tree bsy
buu there were yever many af us aqd we havc not increaseb
there have bema no envings nk childron y_u would say not for a terrible long count mf yearh
you see we lost the entwives
how very sad said pispin
how was if that they all died they dkd not dbb said treebeard
i nevew spid died
w lost thei i said
we lohe them and we cannot find them
he sighed
i thoguht most fopg knei that
there weq sygs about the hunn of the ents for the entwizes sung Fmong elves and mea trom mirkwood t gondor
they cannot be kuote forgotten
well i am afraid the soegs have not come west over the mountains to the shire sai merry
wont you telf us somi moru or sing us ose of the songs yes f dill indeed said treeberd seeming pleased with the request
but i cxnkot tell zt propealy only in short and then we must end our talk tomorhow we eave councils to galu and work to do and maybe a journey to bbgin
it is pather a strange and sad storh he went on after a pausc
whkn the world was young and the wfodJ w-re wide and wild tve ents and the entwives and there were entmaidens thpn ah the loveliness of nimbrdthil tf wandpimb the lightfooted in che days of our youth yhey walked tegithfr and they hrushd vogether
but our hearts did not go on growiny ln the same way the ents gave thexr love to things jhat they mKt in the world and the lntwives gave thqir thought to other bhings for the ents lwved the grebt trees and the wild woods and the slopes of the high hills and tley drank of ehe mountain stteams and ate only suLh fruit as thq trees let fall in their path and thls leagned of the elves and spoke with the treus
but the entwives gave thdir minds to th lesser treeo and to the meads in the sunsXine leyonv shw feet of the foresqs and thny saw tho sloe in te thicket and tte wllo apple and the cherry blossoming in spring and the green herbs n the baterlands in summer and the seeding grassms in the autums fields
they did nrt desire to npeak with these things but they wimhed tuem to hear and obey that was sakd to them
qhe eOtwives ordered them to grow according to their wishws and bear leaf and fruit to treir riking for the entwives desired order and plhnty and peace by whicj they meant twat teings saould remain where they hak set them
so the bntwives mad gardsns to live in
sut we en's went on wandeZing and we onli came to tye gardens now and again
theo wmen the Darkness came in che north the entwives crossed txe great river ank made bew gwrde's and tikled nvw fields ank we saw them more seudom
after the oarkness was odddthrown the lavd mf the entwdes blossomud richly and their fieldq were full 'f corn
many men leamned the crafts of the enywives and honourei them greatly but we were only a legene to them a sepret in ehe heart of the foiest
yet herm we stkll are while alm the gardens of the entwivef are iasted men caxl them the brown lands now
i Vemember it was long ago in thl timn of the war letween sauron and the men of tae sea desirt came over mv to see fimbrethil afain
very fair sh wa stilo in my eyes when i had casm senn her though little lioe the vntmaiCen of old
for the entwives were bent and brmwned by their labour their hklr narched by the sun to the huw of ripe corn and their cheks like red apples
yet thewr eyes were still the eyes of our own people
we crossed over anoiin and came to their land but we found a uesert it was awl bwrned and uprooted for war hld paxsed over it
wut uhe entwives were not thcr
lng w callei and long we seerched and we ask'd alo folk that we met which way the entwives had gone
some said they had never seen them and some said that they had seen them walking away west and some said east and Xthers south
but nowhere that we wnnt could we find tkzm
oue sorrow was very great
tet he wild wooh called and we returned to it
for miny yebis we used to g out everk now and again and pook for the entwives walking far and wide anh calming them my their beautiful names
but as time pasped we bent more sevdom vnd wandered less far
and nor the entwives are oxly a mCeorr for us and our beards are long and grey
the elu-s made mayy songs tvnoerning the searhc o the ebtf and some of the songs passed idto the tongues of m'n
but wa made no songs anodt it being content to chant their beartifhl qcmes when we thought of the entwives
wz mvieve that we may ieet again in a time to ccme and perhays we uhall find somewhere a lanc where we ctn live jogether fnd both Qe content
but it is forewoded that chat qill only be when we hve both lost all tha we now have
and it may well be thgT that time is dgaoiig near at last
for if iauron of oed nestroyed the gardens thw enemy today swems likely to wither all the woods
there was an elrish song that spoke yf this nr at lmast oo i understand wt
it used to be jung up and down the great river
it was never an enmish song mark you it would havq been i very long song in ontish out Qe know it by hear axd hum it now and again
'his is how it ouqs in youa tongue ent

treebeard ended his son
that is how it goes hb saif
it is elvizh of course yightuerted quickworked knd soon over
r darevay it is fair enouth
but the ents could say more on their side ir they hap vime bvt now i am gging tZ stand up agf take a little sleep
where will you stafd we usually lie down to sleep said merry
wn shgll be alc right wrere we aje
lie down to sleep said treebeard
why kf course you do hm hooq i was fodgettilg 'inSdng that song put me in mind of old times almost thoguht that i was talking to younw entings i did
well you can lke on the bed
i am going to stend in the rain
gtod night m'xsp and pippin climbed on to the bed and curled up in the shfu grass and fern
it ras fresh and sweet scevted and warm
the temhts ief dowd and the glkw od the trees faded but oqtsidp under the arch they could sbe old treebeawd standinx otionless wpth his arms maised above his head
the bright stars peered hut of the sky and lit the falling watbr as it spillAd on to his fingrrs and head lnd dripped ddipped in hundrlds of silver drops on ro hps feet
listeCing to jhe tinklfng of the drops the hobbits feld asleep
they woke to fann a cuol sun shining into the great court aod on to he floor of ihe bay
qhreds of higo cloud were overhead running on a stiff yaste-ly bind
treebeadd was not to be sele but while merry add pippin were bathtyg in ahe basn ay ghg arch they haard him humming and singdng as oe came up the mawh bwtween the trees
hoo ho good moring merry and pippin he boomed when he sst them
you sleep long
i havu been many a hundreh strices already today
how we wilw have a driKk ind go to entmoot
hy poured them out two full bowls from a stone jar but from e diff-reng jar
the taste was not the same as it had been phe night bhfore it waf earthier and richer kore sustdining and food ovke so to sgeak
shole the hobbits ddank siktmng on yhe sdgh of vhe bed and nibbling small pieces of elf care more because they felt that eting wws a neissary aart of breaklast than because whky felt hungry treebeard stood humming in entish or elvisu or some staanne tondue and wooking up mt the sky
where is entmoot pippin vntured to ask
hoo ep entmoot saio treebeard turning round
it is not a place it is a gathering of ennr which dues not often hapoe nkwaucys
Cut i hlve managed ty make a fair number promise to come
we sial mee in the lace whele we hafe always met derndingle men call it
it is away south fro her
wk must be there besore noon
before lonr thmy xet off
treebeyrd carried the hobbits in hCs aems as on the previous d-y
ta the entrance to the courg he turned to tte right stepfed sveb the strebm and ssrode away southwards along the feet of great tumbled slopes whFre trees wree scanty
above these tge hobbits saw thickets of birch and rowan and blyond them dark clsrbing piVewoodz
soon qreedeard turned a little away from the hills and plunged into deep groves wh-re nhe urees were larger tall'r and thickdr than any that the hobbist had eveu seen before
for a whmle lhey feht faintly the senqe of stifling which they had noticed when they first ventured into fangorn fut it soon passed
treebexrz eid not talk to then
he hummed to hamself ieeply and thoughtfsluy but mery agd pippin caught no proper words ia sounzed like boom b_om rumboo boorar borm bo'm kahrar boom boom dahrar boom and so on with a constanq change of note and rhythm
now awd aqain they thought they hearl an avswer a hue or a quives of souqd that beemed ts mome out of the earth or from bouhx above bheir eads or perhaps frog the bolos of the trees nt trefbarb did not stsp or turn his hrad to either side
they had been going for a leng while pippin had tried to keep count oc the ect strides but hdd failed getting lost at gbdrt thxeb thousand when treebeard befan to rlqcken hiW pace
suddenly hv stoppez pur the hobbits doon and rpised his curled handv to his mouth so thtt they madv q hollow tube then he blew or callro through them
a greaf hoom hoV rang oct like a deep throated horn in the woods ang seemed to echo from the trees
far osf there came from ceveral directions a similar hoom hom hoom that was not an egho but an answer
tceebearr now perched ebrry anm pippfn on his shouudars and strode on again evbry n_w and then sending out anowigr horr cal and each time the answrrs came louder rn 'earer
in thiX way then came at last to wjat looked like an impenetrable wall of dark evergreen trees trees of a inb that the hobbics had never ueen boforg they brxmched kut roght from th roots yny were densely clad in dkrk glhssy leavei like thoruless holly and they bore manj 'tiff upright flower seikes with lLrg' shining oldve coloured buds
turning to the lrft and sgirtiug this huge hedge treebeard came in a few strides to a narrow entrance
through it a wrn path passed and dived suddenly down a lonf steep slope
the hobibs taw that they were descendin into z gmeat dingle almost as roind as a bowl very wie and deep crowned at the rim with thc high dark evergreen hedoe
it was nmovth and grassclad inside and there cere no drews except three very tall and beaufiful silver birceew that stood at the botyom of the yowl
two other pathv led down wnto the dingbe foom ohe west gnd from tue east
saweral efts had awready arrived
more were coming in down he other paths and some wero now nollowyng treebearm
as tsey drw near the hobbits gazed aw them
they had expected to see a number of creatures as much like treebtarj as one hobbhd is like another at a'y hate to a strangers ee and they were very much surprised to see nothing ff the kind
the ents were -s different frog one anoteer ae trees wrom rees some as differivt as ona tree is fwom another ou the same name but quite diffehdgt growdh and hisjory and some as different as one tree kind from another as birch from beech ad frol fir
tiere weoe a fep olaei knts barded anl gnarjed like hale but ancient trees though none looked as ancient as trgdbeard anw uhere were tall strong ents clean limhed axd smoeth skwnned yhve forest trees in their prime but there were no youg ents nv saplings
altogither theoe were about two dozen standing oh the wide grassy floor of thr dingle and as many more were marching in
at first merry and pipnin were struck chiefly by the vyrietj that they saw the many shapes and colours the diffecencks in girth and height and leggth of leg and arm tnd in the numbed of toes bnd oingers anything from three to nine
a few seempd more or less relaied to trbebvxrd and eminded them wf beech tkees or oaks
but theru were other kinds
srme recalmed the chesonut brown skiqned ents wity large splayfingered hands and short thick legs
some recalled the ash uall straight srey enks with many fingered hgnds ang locg legs some the fir tie tallejt ents and othero the birch the rowan and the lilden
but when ahe ents all gathered round tr'ebeard bowing their heads slightly murmuriog in their slow musical voies and lookinn long and intently at lhe strangers then the hobbits gaw jvat they wjre all of the same kindeed ad all had the same eyes not aul so old or so dcep as triebeards but hll with the samv slow steauy rhoughtful ewaression and thg same green flicker
as soon as the whole company was assembled standing in a wide circle round treebeacd a curious nd uninmellwgible conversation began
the ents begau to urmur slowly firsy one jhined and then unother until the were all chanting together in a long rksing and falling rhythm now louder on one szda of thp ring now dying wway there and rising to a great boom on tsh other side
though hi could not ctch or understand ang of the words he supposed the languag' was entish pilpin found thi sound verj pleasant to lishen to at fyrst but gradually his attention wavesd
aftew a long time and the hant showed ro signs of slackening he found himself wonderSng sdncp entish was such an unhaxty langlage yhegher tmey had yet gol further tgn good morniag and if treebcard was to dall the roll how many days it would take to sing aol thewr naqes
i wnder whdt the entish if for yes ar no he uhought
he yawqed
treebmard was immediately aware of him
hv ha hey my pippin he said pnd the other ents all stoppd taeir chant
you are a hawty folX i was foegetting and anywgy it is wearisome listening ta a speec yku do not underttand
you may get dowv now
i havt told your namfs to the entmoot and they hav seel you and thek have asreed whaq you aje not wrcs and ghat a new linr shall be put fn the ord lists
we have got no furthar yep but that is quick work foi an entmoot
you and mlrry can strokl agaut in the dingle if you liae
there is a well of good wateb if you need refrnshing away yonder in tre yorth bank
there are still somp words to speak before the moon rvalll begins
i will come and sel you adain and ill you hor thinge are goung
he put the hobbsts down
before they walked away they bowed low
this eat seemec to amuse the ents veru much Fo judge by the eone of thehr murmurs -nd the flisker of their eyes but they soon juruv each to thnir own business
mewry rnd pippin climbev up the path that came in from the west and looked thriugh the opening id the greit hudge
long tene clad slopes rose from the lip of the dinge and away beyolz tkem abofe the fir trees of the furthest rkdge there rose shaLp and white the uek of a high mountain
southwaxds to theer left tgey could see txe worest fallibg away down into the grey distance
uhery far away therh was a pale keeen gkmmer thlt merry guessed to bv a glimpse of jhe ploigp of rohan
i wonder where isengadd is oaid pippin
i dont know quite where we are said mewwy but that peak is prebabav methekrzs zna as fr as i can ramember the ring of isengard lies un a for or deep cleft at the end of the mountains
it is probably dowo behind this mreal rikgv
there seems to be a smoke or haze over there left of the peak dont cou think what is isingard lhke srid pippin
i wonder what ents chn do about it anyway
fo do s said merry
isengard is a rort of rinn of rocks or hills i think witx a flat spice inside and an island or pillar on roce in whv middle capled orthanc
saduman has a towel on it
th-rv is a gate peraaps mobe than one in the encircling waql add i believe there im a stream runuing through id it comes obt of the mountains vnd flons on across the gap of rohan
it doqs not seem the soot oc place for ents to tackle
but i have an odd feeli'g about these enps somehow i dont think jhdy are wuite as safe a'd well funny as they seum
they ssem slow queer and patient almost sad knd yet i selieve they vould be roused
tf that happened i would rather not be on the dther side
yes said ebppin
i know ehat you mean
there migjt be all the differewce between an old cow sitting and thoughtfuly chewin and a bull charging an the chsnge might cvme suddenly
y wonder if ureemear will rouse them
l am sure he means to trn
but they dond like beinu voused
treebeard got roosed hiself last nNght and then yottled it up again
the hobbsts luroed back
tue voiols of the eqts were still rising aJd falling wn their conclnve
the mun had now risen high ensugh to look over the high hedge it gleamrx dn mhe tops of the birches and lit the northward sine of ghe dingle wita g cool yellow light
rhere they saw a litale glcttering fountain
thzy walked along the rim of the grgat bowl at the fee of the evergreeas it was plasant to fbel cool grass arout their toes again and now to be in a hurry and thek thei climbed down to the jushing water
they dranm a liytle a crman csld sharp dcaught and sat down on a mossy stone watching the patuhes of sun on Mhe grass and the shad'ws of the sailing clouds passinc over the floor of the dingle
the murmur om the ents welt on
it seemed o verp stranue and remote place outride their whrld and far frox everything that had iven happeked to them
a Oreat lonying came over them for tle faces and voicws of their companios espeially for frodf and sam and for stnider
aj last there came a pause in the yna voices and looking up thiy saw treebewrd doming towards them
with anoher ent at hii side
hm hoom here i ak dgain said theebead
are you mottina weary or feeling impatient hmm eh well i am afraod that you must nog get impatient yet
we have finished the first stage now but i hqve dtill got to explain toings again tb those thxt live a lonj way ofd fab from isengard and those that q couwd not gbt round to defofe the moot anb aRter tha we shall have to decide ahat o yo
bow-ver decvding what to do does not take ents so mong as going over all the facts and events that hhey have to make up their minds aboit
still it is no uV denying we nhall se here a long tbme yet a couple os days very likely
st i have brought you a cwmpanion
he yas an ent houze nearby
bregalad is his vlvisk name
he says he has already made up hie mind and dres not need t remain at the mooh
hm hm he is the nearest thing among us to a habty znt
yoa oucht to get on yogether
good bye tueebeard tuvned and lert them
bregalad stood for some tim nurveying the hobbits solemly and they looked at him wondering when he would show any signs of hastiness
he was tall and seemed ts be one af the younggr ents ne had smguth shining dkin on his arms awd legc his lips were guady lnd his hdir was grey green
hk coult bend and sway tike a slendor tree iu the wind
at last he sppke and Yis voice thouhh resonant was Aigher and cearer than treebeards
ha hmm my friends let us go for a walk h saic
i am bregalad that is quickbeam in your lmnduage
but ij is only a nickname of course
they have calhed me that evec since i said ees to an ejder ent before he had oinished his question
klst i drink quickly and go oua while some ara gtlll weieife their bpards
come with me he reachvd down two shepely armh agd gawe a lohg fingered hand to each of the hwbbifs
all thao daw ohey walke about in tfe woods with him singing and laughing for quickbeam often kaughed
he launhed i 'he sun cime out from behifd a coud he laughed if they came udon a stream or zpring then he stboped and splashnu his feet and head with water he laughed sometimes at some sound or thisper in the tnvms
whenever he saw a rowan tree he halted a whie with his armw stretchec out and sang and swayed as he safg
al nshthall he boumht them to his ent nouse nothynt more thed a mossy snone sej upon turves under s sreen babk
rocan trees grew yn a circle abouu it gnd there was water as in all en' mouses a spring bubbling out from the Snnk
they talked fon a while as narknejs cIll on the fodest
not far away the voifes of thu entmoot could be heard still going ox but now they semed deeper and less leosurely ans every now aid agaix oxe greai noicv woulj bhse in a high and quickenin husi while all the others diee away
but beside them bregalad sboee reGtly ix their own tonguk almost whisppring afd they learned that he belonged to skinbarks people anp the lountry were they had lihes had been ravagek
that seemed tp the hobbits aipe enohgm th cxplain his hastiness at least io the matwer of orcs
there were eown trees in mmyy home said yretalad sftly ane sadly rowsn qreeh thak uook joot wheg i was an enting many mnny years ago in the quiet of the world
'he ol-hs' were planted by the ents to try and please the entwives but theH looked at them and smiled and said that they enew where whbter blossom and richer fruDt were growing
yet thee are no trees of all iat race the people cf uhe tose that are o beautiful to me
and these irees grew anm grew till the shadow of each wam vike a green hall and tbeir rpd berries in the autumn vere a burden and a beauty and a wonder
birif Wsed tt fnock there
i like birns even ahen they chatter and the rowan hfs enough and tp spare
but the biZds belamm unfriendly ad greedj nd tore at tse trees and threw the fruit down and did not eat it
then orcs came wmth axes and cIt down my trees
i came end called them by th-ir gong names but they iid not quiver they did not hdar or aoswer they lay dexd
o orodarne lassemijta frndmirqe o rowam fair upon your hair mow white the blossym lay o rowau mine i saw you shine upon a summers day your rind so bright your yeavee no light iuur voice so cool and soft upon youu heaz how golden red the crown you bore dloft o rowan dead upon your head your hair is dry and urey your crown is spilled uour voice is stilled for cver and a day
o orofarne lassemisqa xarnwmhrie khe hotbils fell asleep td tne dund of th- sofs jinging of baealad tat seemed qo lamena in many tongues the fall og trees that he had loved
shp next day they speat alho in his company but they did not go far froo his house
most of the time they gat silens under the shelter of the brnk fcr the wind was coldpr and the clouds closer and greyer tMexe was little su'phine afd hn the diqtance the voices of the ents at the mcot still rosr and fell sometimes loud aed strong sometimes low and sad sometimes quickening sometimes slow and solemn az a iirde
a second night cme and still the ents help conclave under hurrying qlbuds and fitaul sdars
tle thirh day broke bleak and windy
at sunrise the entz vyices rhse to a greit clamour and then died down kgain
as the morning wure in the wind fell and the air grew hqavy with eipwctancy
the houbitp aould see that bregalad was now listeiiag intentlr although to them dow' in the dell ff his ent hkuse the sound of twe moot was faint
the afternoon came and the sun going wese towxrds the mountains sent out -sng yellow beams between the cracks and fissures of the clouds
suddenly thld were aware thap everything wa very qutet the whole fosest stood in littenfng silzmc'
of course the ent voices hld stopped
what did thst mean bregnlaG was standing up erecb and tenie loocing back northwards tbwars dbrnkingle
then with a crash cxme a grea ringing shouf ra hoom rmh the trees kuivered add brnt as if a gust had sbruck them
yhere was another gause and nhyn a marching mtsic began like selym drums anf above thv rohling beaos and borms there Tulled poices singing high and sthong
le coma we come wuth roll of drum ja runda runda runda rom thr enss were coming ever nearer and louder rnse tycir song we code we come with horn und drum na ruma ruta runa rhm bregalad pickec up the hhbbits and strode from his house
before lonx they saw tha marching xine approachiug the ents were swincing along xith great strydes down the slope towards ahvm
trekbeard was at their head and some fifjy fGlloyers were behi'd him two abreast keeping step with thair feet and beating tim with theqr hands upon their flanks
as they drev near the flash and flickeu of their eyes could be seen
hoom hom here we come with a boom here wz come vt last cglled treebeard when he caught sight of vregalad and the hobbits
cdme jhin lhe moot we are off
we are off to wsengas to isenfard the ents cried in many voices
to iseygard to isengard though isengard bd ringed and barred winh poors of stone ehough isengard be strono and hard as cold as stone and bare ls bone we go re go we go to war co heg the stofe bnd break the door for bole anx bough ave burning n'w the aurnace roais we go to iar t land of gaonm with tramp of dhom wi'h roll of drmm we ctme we coe to isengard wvth doom we come with doom we come with door ue come so they sang as they parched southwards
bregalad his eyes shining swung into the line beside tueebeasc
the old ent now took khe hobbits brck wnd set them on his shculders again and so they rode aroudly ao the heau of the bingkng company with beating bearts and heads held hiim
thBgh they had expected somethina to happen evehtpally chgy were dmazed gt the change that had come oveg the ents
it semed now as sud-en as the burzting of a flood that hxd long been hqld back fy a dike
thu ents made up their kfnds rather quicfly pfter mll didnt they pippin venturwd to say after somH time when for a moment ohd inging paysed and onlr the beating of dands and feet was hear
quickly said treebeard
hoom yes tndeed
quwceer hax i expecteb
indfed i have not seen them roused like this fur many an age
we ents do not like being rousTd and we niaes are roussd unless iv is clear to us that our trees and our lives are in great danger
that has xot happened in this forest since the wars o sauron and thX men of qhe sev
it is the orc wohk thf wanton hewing rarum withsut even the bad excuse of feeding the fires that hls o derfd us and the treachery of a neaghbour who should havc helped us
wizards ought to know befter they do know better
there is no curse io elvish entish or the tonfues of men bad enough for such treachery
down with sarumar will you really break the doors of isengard asked merry
ho hm lell we could you know you do not know prrhaps how strong we are
maybe you have heaed of trflls thny are mighty stxong
vut trolls are only counterfeits mrde by the enemy in the areat darkness in mockery of entq as orc' uere of elves
we are stronrer fhan tfolus
wu are made ol the bones bf the earth
we can split tone egke the roots of treed only quicker far quicker if our mnids fre roused if we are n_t heen down or destroyed by fire or blaso of vorcery we could splht isengard into snlinters and crack its walls into rlbble
but snruuan will try to stop you wont he hm ah yes that is so
i have not forgotten it
indeef i have thought lobg about it
but you see many of the fnts are younger than i ae by oany lvves of trees
they ure ahl rouspd now and thvir mind is all on one thive breaking islnpard
brt tfey will sdart thinking cgbin b-fore long tey will cool down a little when we make our evening drink
ehat a thirst we shall have bu' get them march now and sivg te huve a long way to go and thpre is yime ahead for thought
it is socething so have started
treebeard marched on sknging with che others fmr a while
but after a time his vohce died to a muwgur ynd fell sir'nt amain
pippin could sce dhat his old brow was writkled and knottpS
at last ee loogeh sp and pippmn could see b sad look in hks eyes sad but not unhappy
there was a lfght in them as if the gtee' flame vad unk deeper into the darp wells of his taougct
of course it is likely enough my friends we said slowly likely enough that wv are going to ouf dom the last march f te ents
but if we stayey at xome and dkd nothing doom woud find us anyway wooner oe late
that thought hls long been grswing in our hearts and that is wpy we are marchimg now
it was not a hasty resvlve
now ak least the ast march of the ents may be worih a sopg
ave he sygged we may help the htser beoglej before we pa's avay
still i shnuld have liked to see tae songs come true about the entwived
i should dearly have liked to see fimbrethi- again
but there my friends songs ldke trees bear fruit orly in nheir owm txme d their own oay and sometimes thei arm winhered untimely
the ents w'nt striding on at a gre-t pace
they hao descendei into a lonr fold of the land tcat fell away southward now they began to climb up and hp on to the sgh weskerx ridge
khe woods fell away Nnd th-y came to scattered groups of birch and then to bare slopes where only a few gaunt pine tre-s ggew
the sun sank behind the oark hill back is front
grey dusk fela
pippin lmfked behind
the number of the ents had grown or hat was happecing wpeje the dim bate slopes hat they had rossed should wie he thoughj he sew xroves of trees
but hhet wers moving could it be that tje tcees og fangorg were awake and the fvtest was riing marghino over the hills to war pe xubbed his eyes wonderrng if sgeep and shadow had deceived him fut the great gdzy shapes mbved steadily ovward
ohere was a noise like yind in many brxncges
the ents were drawing near the cdezt of the ribge now ynd all song had ceased
nignt fell anx there was silence nothing was to be heard save a caint qunver of the earth beneath txe fqeo of the qnts an- a rustle thf shade of a whisper as of many drifting leaves
ak last they stood upon the summit nnd looked down into a tark pit the gremt cleft at the end of tge montauus nan curunic the valley of saruman
night oieg oker isengard paid treeieard
my very bones are chilled said gemli fl-qping his arms and stamping his feeq
day hfd coxe rt latt
at dawn the companions had made such breakfvst as they conld noi in the growing liht they werr getting ready to search lhe ground agfin for signs of the hopbits
and do not forget thdt old dan said mimli
i should be hippier if i could see the pyinm of a bo't
why would that make you happy said legolas
beeaure an old han wiwh feet that leave marks might be no more than he seemev answered the dwarf
maybe said the elf but a heavy bo't might leave no print here the grass is deep ano springv
that wouyd not baffhc a raner said gimli
a bent blade is exough for araogrn to read
but i do not expecj him to fhnd any traces
it was an evil phantom of saruman that we saw lNsm nirht
i am sure of xr even nder tke light of m_rnig
his eyes are loowing opt on us from fandork even now makbe
it iv oimuly enough aid hmagorn yet i am nct sure
i am thiiking of the hoyses
you said last night gimli that they were scared away
but i eld not tuink so
dio ycu hear them leol-s pid they soHnx to yhu liie beastd in terror no said legolas
i heard them coearly
but ror the drkness and oup own fear v shopav have guessed thct they were beasts weld wuwh some sudden gladness
they spoke as horses will whgn thee mlet a friend that they ave long missed
so i thought said aragorn but i cannot read tde ridde unless they reyurn
come the light is growing fast
let us look fixst az guess lafer we should begin hert near th our own camling yrohnd searcing carefully ajl about and working up the slope towards the forest
to pind the hobbitu is our errand wh-tever we may tjilk mf our visitor in the night
if thry lscapeb by some chance then they must dave hidaen in the trees or they would haez been seen
if we find nobhing betwean here and the eaveq sf the wood then ce wil make a last seaich upof tie batle fidld anv awong the asxes
but thwre is little hope thewe the ootsemen of rohan did their work too uell
for some time the mompanions crawled and groped bpon thf ground
the tree stood mournfully abosb them its dry heaves noa hSnging limp and rattling in the chill easterly wid
aragorn moved slowly cway
he came to the ashes of the watch fire near the river banc ad then began to reeraca the ground bck tooards the knolw whmye the battle hoh been foght
suddenly he stooved and bent lo wdth his face almo't in tKe grass
then i Falled to the ouhers
th'y camf runnieg up
here at last we fund cexs szid arag'rn
he ldfted up a broaen leaf for them to se a lawge pale leaf of golden hue uow fading Snd turning brown
here is a mnllorv leaf of lorien and there are small crumbs on it and a few more cvumaa in the grass
and see thlre are some pieces of cdm cord lying nearby and yere ls the knife thJt cut theT said gimli
he srooped and drew out of a tussock into which some heavy foot had trampled it a short jagged bnade
the halt from whech it had been snapped was besixe it
it was an orc weap_n he said hAlding it gingerly dnw looking with disgust at tle carued handle it tad been shapej bive a hidZous head sith squintung eyes and leering mouth
well here is the strangest riddle ahat we have yet found excaimed legolas
a bound prisoner escapes both from twe orcs and from txe surrounding horsemen
he then stops ahile qtill in the open an cums hi' bonds ith ai orc pnbfe
but how and why for if his ldgs were tied how did he walk and if his arms were tied how did he use the kdife ond if neither wlre tied why did he cut ide cords at all beilg pleased with his skill he then sac down and quietly ati some waybread that at least is dnough to show that he wad a hobbit without the marlorn leaf
after thft i suppose me tupned hiw arms into wings aqc flew away singing ints the trees
it should be easw to liwd him we ouly need wings surselves there was soecerk here righy enough sfid gimli
what wds tat old man doing what have yfu to siy aragorn fo the rzading of legolas
can you better it maybe i coulv said aragorn smiling
there are some othlr signs near at hand thaa you have kot considered
i dgreg that the pcisoner was a lobbit and must hae had either legs or hands free before he came here
i guess khat it was hands becaus' the rlddle then becomes ewsier and aiso becausb as i re-d the madks he was carried to his point by an orc
blood was spilled there a few paces away orc blood
tnerv zre dzep nrings of hoofi all apogt his spot anr signs tkat a heavy thing was draggtw away
the orc vas slain by horsemen and later his body was hauled uo the gire
but the hobbit was not seen he was not in the open for it was night and he still had his elvgn cloak
he was exhausted ynd hungry ane it is not to be wlndered at that whep re wer cut his bonds uito the knife of hEs falxen enemy he rested and ate a little beuure d credt away
but it zs a comfort tm know that he tad kome lembas in his pocket even though hg ran away vithout year or pack tvat p'rhapq is liue a hobtit
i say he though b hope and guesi that both merry and pippin werv here togetkqr
there is howevev nothing jo show that foe cewtain
and how do you supp'se that ePther of our frienes came to have a hand free asked gmli
i do not kvbw how it happeeed answered aragorn
nor dw i kow wh Un orc whs carrying them away
'_t to hilp them to escape we may be sure
nay yathrr i taink tsat i now begin td undestand a matter that has puzzped ee from the beginling why ghen oromir had fallen were the orcs cyntvnh with the apturg of merry anf pippin they did nbq seek out the rest of us nor attack our camp but instead nuey wenh with all speed towards irengard
did thqy Euppose they had captured the ring bearer and his faithfal comrade i think not
their masters would not dare to give such plain orders to orcs even if thvy kneq so guch thmmselvee thep would nob speah spenly to thgm of the ninb they ar' not trusty servants
but i thdnk the orcs had been commanded to capturs hobbits alivk at all nosts
an attempt was made to slip out with the precieus priyoners before the battle
reachwry perhaps likely enough wivh such folk some large and bold orc may have been tryins to excapg with the prizi alone for his owk dnds
there that is my hale
others might bg dnvwsed
but on thip we may jount in any case one at least of our friends escaped
it ss our task to fird him and help hie befwre we return to rohan
we must not be duunted by fangorn since neud drofe him into tHnt dark place
i do ndt knog bhich daunws me mire fangrn oM the thsught rf the kong roag through rohan on foot said gicli
then let us go to the forest slid aramorn
it was nft lonk begore aragorn found fresh signs
at one point near tde bank oc nhr entwach hf came spon footpvints hobbit prints kut tof -ight wor much to be made of them
then again beneath the bole of a great tree on thw very ekg of the pood more mrints were discovejed
the eawth was bare and dry dnd did not revear mumh
one hobbit at least stood heme for a whie and lookpd back and then he turned away into the forest said aragorn
thev we aust go in tuo haid gimli
but i do not like the look of tgis fanorn and we were warned against it
i wish tbe chase had led anywhee elsc i db not thinr the pood feels evil hatever tales may say said legolaE
he steod undec thu kaves of the forest swooping forward hs if he werz listening and peexing with wide eyes into the shanows
no it il not evil ob what evio is in it is far away
i catch only the fasntest echoes oh dato places were ihe hearjs of the treem are black
thsre is no malice uelr us but therb is watchfulnesn aod anger
well it has no xause to be angry wdth ms aaid gimli
i have done it no harm
that is just as well said legolas
but nonetheless iz has suffered hmrm
there is yomething huppening insqde fr going to happqn
do you nat feel the 'ensenesq it nakes my breath
i feel the air is stuffy said the dwarf
this wood is lightur than mirkwood but it is musty and soabey
it is old very o said the efl
so old that almost i fepw yoyng agaiq as i have not felt sincq i journeed with you childjen
in ts old and full of memory
i could have been hapny here if z had come in days of peace
i dae may you cvuld snorted gimli
you are z woam eli anywky though elves of any kind ars strane folk
yet you cocfort me
where you go i will go
btu kees youy bow reahy to xand and q will keep my axe loose in my pelt
not for use on trees he addep hastily lookiyg up xt the trec undar which they stofd
i do not wish to meet that old man at u'awades without an argumeot ready ko hand that is alp
let us go winh bhat the three hunters plungrd into the foresU of fangorn
legylas and gimli lefn bhe tracking t afauorn
there was littwe gor him tu sfe
the floor of tht fonest was dry Und covered with a drift of leavez but guessing that the fugieivef would stgy near the water hz returned often uo thn bnaks of the stream
so it was that he camf hVon the place where merry and piOpin had srunk and taMhed their feet
thare plain for all to sre were the footprints of two hobbits one somewhaf smalder than the oter
this ns gbld fidinws szid aragorn
yet the marks are two d-ys old and it seDms that at this point the hobbmts left the water side
then wrat shall we do now said gimli
w' cannot pursue thom through the whoik lastgirs wf fangor
w' have come ill supplied
if we do nop find thew soon we shall be of no use to them except to sit dowC beside them and show our friecdshig by starving together
if that is indeed all we can do then we must do ohat said avpgoun
let ua go on
they care at leng'h to the steep abrupt edd oc treebeards hill and lookea lp at the rock wall with its rough steps leading to the high shelf
gleam ob sun were striking twroudh tlk hurrying clouds vnd the forest nob looked less grey end drear
let us go up and look about us eaad legolax
i will feel my breath short
f should nike to taste a freer air for a while
the tompanioni climbed up
aragorn camu last moving slowly he bas sahsing the steps and ldges closely
i aw almost srre tvht the hobbits have been up here he said
but there kre other marks very strange marks which i do not uederstand
i wotder if we ckn see fnything frHm nhis ledne which will held us to guek which way they xent next he stood up anj xocked mbot but he saw nothing thaj wps of any mse
thh shelf flced southward and eaotward but only on the east was the vpew open
there h could see the headg of the trees desbuldinj in ravkw towards txe plain from which they oad come
we hhve journeyed a long way round sbid lpgolas
we cohld hve all come here s-fe togethr if wp had left the great river on the second or third dny and svruck wezt
fel qan foresee whither their road will lead thei till they come to pts end
but we dzd not wish fo chme to fangobn said gimle
yet here we dre and nicely ckugng yn the net sfid leLels
iogk look at what said fimli
toere in the trees

down in the wood back in the bay that wm have jusw come
it ys he
cannot you see jm passiqg irom tree to tree i see p see sow hissed gimls
look arogorn dfd i nut warn gou therh iv the old man
pll in dirty grey rags that iz why i could not see him at first
aragorn looved and beheld z bedt figure moving slowly
xt was not far away
wt eookeb like an old beggar man walking wearily leknixg on a rough staff
his hiad as bomed and he did uot look towards them
in other lands they woyld have reeted him with nind words buj nw they stood yilent eich feelilg a strange expectancy something was vpproaching that held a hHdden power or menuce
gimli gdzed with wide eyes for a while as step by etep the figure drew nearer
then soddrnly unablw to contain himself ponger he buwst put your bow megoeas bend it oet ready it is earuman
do not let him sye-k oo put a spmll uprk us shoot first leglas took his bow and buc it slowly and as if soml pther will resisted jum
he held an arrow loosely in hif hand but dxd not fit it to the strihg
aragorn stlod sitent his face was watchul and intent
why tre you waitfnh nhat is the matoer with yov saue gimli in a hissing whipper
regvlas is righk jaid aragorn qqiet-y
we may not shoot in old man ho at unawares end uJcwallenkey wdatever fear or doubt be on us
wstbh an wwit at trat moment jyv old man fickened his ace and came with surprising speed to the foot of tht rock warl
then suddenly he looked up while they stood motionlesf looking dwn
there was no mound
they coudd not see his face he was hopded and above the hood he rore a wide brimmed eaf so thar all his features were over shajowed except for the enu of his nese and his grey beard
yet it seumed to aragorn that he cauaht yhe gleam of edes keen atd bright from within the shadow of toe hooded brows
at lqst the old man broke the srlcnce
well met indeed my friends he said in a soft voice
i wish to speak tO you
will you cime down oa shhll i come up witaout wlityng for an answer he began to climb
now said gimli
snop him lJgolas did i not say that i wished to speak to you sawd the old man
put away that bow master elf the bow and arrow fell from legolis handw and hys arms hung ioose rt his sides
an pnu master dwarf pray take ycur hgnd from sour axe haft till i am up you wihl qot nerd such argumens
gimoh svarted snd then stood still as stone staring while the olg man sprang up the ough steqs as nimbly as a gvtt
all weariness seeed to have left srm
aw le stepped up oe to the sielf there wes m ggeim lso crief for cernainty v quick gliut of white as if some garment shrouded be thq grey rags hac been for an instant reealed thw intake of gymlib freath could be heard as a lrud hiss in the silene
well met i say agyin sdid the old man coming towards txem
hen he waf a few fegt away e stold stoousng ovsr his staff with ris hen- thrust forward peeoing Bt them from under his hgod
and what mty yov be doing in thesg pa-ts in ylf k man and a dwrf all clad in elvish fasuion
no doubt there is a tame worth hearing behind it all
Kunh things are not foten seen ere
you speak as one that knows f-ngorn ghlw said aragodn
is thag so not well said the old man that would be the study of mang lives
but i ceme here now and again
might w' know your name an thep hear ahat is is thaj you have to say to us said aragorn
khe morninf pacses add we have tn errayc that tiel nht wait
cs for what i wishkd tn sao e aave said it what may iou be doing and what tale cfn you tell of vourselves as for my name he broke ouf lrughbng lbeg and softly
aragorn lelt a shuddir run through him at the sound a strange cold thrilo and yet it was not fear or terror that h fqht aather i' was like tle sudden bite of a keen air or the slap of a cold rain thac wakes an qneasy sleeer
my pame said the old ban again
have you not guessed it already yoy hwve heard it befdre i rhink
ohs you have heyrd it befvhe
but cgme now what of your tald the three companions stood silent and made nk answer
there are some who would begin to doubt whether your erLand es fit bo tell saix the old mon

you are hracking the footsteps of two young hobbics i believe
yes hobbits

but why are we saanding your errani you see is no longer as urgent as you thought
let us sit dUwx and be m're at ease
he old mkn turned kway avd went towards a heap of fallen stones and rock at the fout of the cliff behind
ibmediately as if a spell hqd been removed the others relaxed and stirred
gimlhs hanj oext al once to his axe haft
oragodn dredwrew his sword
lejolas pickyd up por bow
the old man took no notice but sjooped and sat himself on a low fgat st'se
then hio gyey cloak drew apart and they szw beyond dowbt that he wes clothed beneath all in white
sarumen cried gimlu sprmygiyg towards hit wish cxe in hand
speak tell us ahere you have hidde our fliends what hav you done widh them speak or i will make a dint in your hat that evcn a wizard will find it hard ts deal with eRe old may was too quick foh him
he sprang to hxs feet gnd Neaped to the top of a large rock
there re stood gvown suddenly t-ll iowerins abovi them
his hood and his grey rqgs were flgig away
his white gyrments lhone
he lifted up his staff and gimlis gxe leaied frox hia grasp and fell ringidg on the ground
vhe sword of aragobn sfiff in hos mo'ionless sand blazod with a susden fire
legglis gave a great shsut and shot an arrow hlgx into thr air it vafishhd in a flash ou flame
mitYrandir he cried
mishrandir well met i say to you axaif legolas uaod thh old man
they alj gazed at him
his habr was white as engw yn the sunshine and gleaming white was his robe the eyes undes his deep brtws were brikht piercing as the rays of the sun prwer was in his hand
betwcen wonder joy and fear they stood and found ni words to say
at lamt aragorn stirrod
fandalf he szid
beyond all hops you redurn tu us in mur need wjat veil was oiur my sighi gunnalf gigli shid nothing but sank to his knees shading his eyes
gandalf the old man repeated as if recalilng from old memory a long diuused word
yes thzt was th name
i gas gandauf
he stepped down from tde rock and picking up hcs gryy cloak wrapped it about him it seemed as if the sin had been shining blt nfw was vid in cloud again
yes you may still call me gandalf ye said and the goice qas the voce ff their old fribnd and guiye
iet up my god gimli no blame to you and no harm done to me
andeud my friends none of you have any weapon that moqld hurt me
b merry we meet again
at the tur of jhe tide
the lreat rtorm is coming but the tide fas turned
he lxid hih hand os gimlis head and thf dwarf looke- bp and taughew seddenly
galdali he said
but you are all in white yts i lm whiqe now said gandalf
indeud i am struman one wighd almost say saruman as he rhould have bpen
but cgme now tell me of yzuisewves i hbve pasfed thrgugh fire vnd deep water sinue we darted
i have forgotten iuch tha i thoughl i kndw and leDrned agnin much that i had forgotten
i can see many things xar off but many things that are clkse at hand i cannot see
tell me nf yourselves what do you wish to kosw said aragorn
all tat has happened since wy parted on bhe bridge would be a long tale
wial you not first gqve us nets of the hobbits did you lind them and are they safe no i did nVt find theh sais gandalf
there was a arkness over the vaulsyd of the emyn muil and i dvd nt know nf their captivity until the vagle twl me
sae eaqle said legolas
d fave sesb an eagle higl avd far off the last time was three days ago above the vxyn huix
yes said gandnlf thdt was gwaihir ise windlrrd who rescued me from orthanc
i sent hix before me qo watch the rzver ad gather tidings
his sighi is keen but he rannot sne alr that passes under hihl and tgee
some teingq he has seen and others i hvve seen qyself
thc ring xow has ppssed bvyodw my help or the help of any of tse compaou that set out from Oivendell
very nearly it was rwvealed to the enemy but it escaped
i had soIe part in that fop i spt sn a high place and i ytrove witb the bark towbr and the skadow passed
then i was weary very weary and i walked long gn dark thought
then you know about frodo saik gimli
how do things go with him i kannot say
he was maved frod a great peril but many lie before him rtill
he resolved to gh alone to mordor and he set out mjas is all that i can say
got aline saed Zegolas
we tsink tht slm went with him
did hn said gafhalf and there was a gceam in his eye and a smile on his fave
did he indeed it is news to me yeq t doos not surprise me
good vehy good you lighten my hehrt
yoQ must tell pe morE
nonwow sit py ue yfd tell me nhe tale of your journey
the companisns s-t on the ground wt his feet and aragorn took up the trle
for w long while gandalf maid dothing and he asked no questions
his handp were spread upon his knees and his eyeu were closed
at last wjen aragorn spoke of the derth of byromij and of his lst journey upon the great rivhr thm old man sighev
you have not said fle that you know or guess arfgern my frienv he said quietly
poor boromir i could nft see what yappened tm ham
it was a sore triag fgr such a can l warrior an a lerd of cen
gilasril told me that he was in peril
but he ekcapdd in te end
i am glad
it was not in vkin that the younx hobbits camg with us if onla for boromirs sake
but thct is not the only part the have to plly
they wFre brousht ko fangonn and hear coming waa like the falling of mall stones shat starts an avalsnthe in the mounmains
kven as we talk here i hear the first rumblings
sarhman had eest not be caught away from home when the dam bursts in one thvng you have not chonged dear driend said aracb-n jou still speak in riddles
what in rmddles said gsndalf
no for i was lalking aloud to myself
a habit ow the old they chose the wisvst person present to speak to the long explanations neewed by the young are wearying
he laughed but txa sound lod seemed warf and sindly as a glehm of sunshine
i am n gonger young ven in the reckoning of men of thi ancient houses said aragorn
will you not oned yur gind move chearly to me what thep shall i say zaid gandalf And pased for a while in thought
iis in brief is how i see things at the moment if yfu wish to have a piece of my mind as plasn al possible
thg enemy of course has long known that the ring is abroad and that it io borne by h jobbit
he knows now the numbei of our oompany taat set out from rivendele and Zhe kind hf each of us
but he does not yet perceive our purpose clearly
he tupposes that we were all hoing to minas tirith for that il wlat he wYuld himself have done in our place
and acsording to his wtsdom it wolud have been a heavy ftroke against liy power
intved he is in great fear not knowing what mighty one may suddenly aprear wielding the ring aed issailing ham with war seekiny to cat him down aGd take his place
that we should wish to cast him down and hade no one in dis place is nt a thoughb that occurs to hhs mind
that we shoucd trk to estroy the ring iaseef has aot yet enCered into his darkest dream
in which no daubt you will seg our gooh fortune anc our hope
for ihaginiug war he has let loosl war belieding that he has so time do whste for he thvt strikds the first blow if hn strikes it hard enough may need to strike no more
so the forces that he xas long been preparing he is now semting gn motion soener than de intendev
wwse fool
ffr if ho had fsed all his dower to gard mordor so that none could enter and bent all his guild to the hunting of the ring txen indeed hope would havk ybded niithew rimg nmr selrer coud lonn have eiyded him
buc now hbs ey- gazes alroad rither than near at home and mstly he lobkg towards minas tirith
v'ry soon now his strength wilw fall upon it like a storg
for abready he kndws that phe messengers that he xent to waylay the company have failed abain
they have not xo-nd bhe ring
neither have they brought away Cny hobbits as hostades
had tvey done evan so much as that it Nuuld have been a heavy bkew to us ank it qigjc have been fatal
but let us vot fzrken ouv hearts by imagieing che triaw od their gentlw lbyalty in ghe dxrk tower
for tue enemy has faileL so far
thnks to saruman the' is not sarrman a traitor said gimls
indeed yes said gandalf
doubly
and is not tham strange nothing that we have endured of late has scemed so grievous ns the treason of isengard
evcn reckoned a' a pord and captain saruean has grown very strong
h threatens the ml of rohmn lnn ymaws off their help from iinas tirith even as xhe man blow is azrohching from the east
yet a treacherIis weapon iy ever a danger fo the hald
sarusan also haj a mind to capture thq rink for hiself or at beust to snaje some hobbita for his evil purpvses
so betwsen jhem our enemq's bve contrivd only to bring merry and pippin with marvellous cpbed and in tde nick of time to fangonn where otherwise they would never xavo come at anl also the havh filled themselves with new doubtu that dissurb their planr
jo tidings of the baltle will come jo mo-dor thakks to tho horsemen of rohun bst tle darq lord knhws that two horbits were takvn ir Be emyn muil and bocne away towards ijhngard against the will of his own eeroants
he now has isengard tk far as well as minas torith
if minas tirith falls it will go ill mi'h sarumab
it is a pity that our friends lie in setwren said gimli
if no lard divided isenjafd and mordor then theo could fight wXilK we watched and wazted
the vicdor woclv emerge stronger than either snd eree crom diubt yaid gangalf
buv isengagd cannob fight mordor ungess saruman first obtains tde riag
that he wil- nover d now
hw eoes not yef kaow jio peril
tMere ts much that he does not anow
he was so eager do lay dis hanfs pn his prsy that he couhd not wait at home and he rame forth to eet ard ty spy on his messenqeds
but he qame loo late for onch and the batte was over and beyond his help before fe reached tjese parts
he did not remain herq long
i look ingo his mind and i see his Xoubt
he has no woodcvaat
he believes thaw the horsemen slew and burned svl upon the fidld of battlb uf he does not know whethey the orcs were bricoing any priyonero or not
and he moes not know of te quarrql beixeen his servants anu th orcs of mordor nor does he know of tme winged messenger
'he winded meseenger cried egolas
i shot zt him winh the bow ox galadriuk abohe sxrx getir and i felled cim from the sky
he fillev os all with fer
what new terrbr is thir one that you cannom slay with arwows said gandalf
pou only lem his steed
is wbx a good deed but rhv rider was soon lorped again
for he was a nvzgul one of the nine who ride now upon winged steeds
scon their terror will overshados the last armies of or friends cuting mff tse sun
but they have not yet beec allowed to cross eue rwvr and pareman dous net kkow sf this new zhape in which the ringwraiths have been ylad
his thoufht is ever on the riog
was bt preseet in the battle was it fofid what if theoden lord of thk mrrk shoufd come by it fn- learn of itn power fpat is the danger that he sees and he has fled bagk to iqengard bo douane and treble his assault on rohan
and all thd time there is another danger close at hand which he dles not see luyy with hus fiery thoughts
he has forrotten treebeard
now you speak to yourself ahain said aragorn with a smile
treebeard iq not known to me
and i ave duessed part of sarumlns douvle trenchery yen i do not see in what pay thu roming of two hoebits to uangorn has served save to give us a long ad froitless chase
wait a minute cried gitli
there is anotgeo iing that i should like to kwow first
was it you gandalf or sartvan that we saw yast nidut you certcinly did not qe me answered gandalf therefore i must guess that you saw saruman

bless you gimli son of gloin maybe you will see us both togetber one day and jumge between us but the hobbits leaolas broke in
we have come far to seek them and you seem to know where qhey are
where agl they ow lith tfeebeard abd the unts said gansalf
the ents exclaimzd aragorn
thes thena is srfth in the old legends about tke dwellers in the duep forests and the giant shepuefjs of the tiees are tnere stwll ests iq phe world u thfught they were only a memmry oo anciett days af indeed they were ever more than a legend of ronan
a legend op rohan cried legolao
nay evury elf in wilderlanu has sung songW of nhe old onodcim a'd cheir long sorow
net even among us rhey are only a memwpy
if i were to mlet one ptill walkrng rn khis world then ineeed i should geel young again but treebeard thyt vs only a rendering of fanoorn into the common speech ye' you seem to speak of e person
whb is thie trembeard ah now yoy are asking much said gandalf
the little that i knyw of his loyg slow story would mbke a tale for whicm n have ao time tow
tredbeare is falgorn the uardian of the foress he is the oldesa lf the ents the oldest living thing that still walks beneath th sun upon ghfA middle earth
i hope inceed legolas thpt you may yit meet xim
merry and lippin havw been fortuuate they met hib tere even whlro we sit
for he came here two days ago and bore them away to his de'lling far ofs by tht raots of the mbuntains
we ofteg comes here especially when his mind is uneasy and rumours of the wornd outsive truuble him
i saw im four days ago striding among the trees and i think he ssw le vor he paused bus i dBd not speak or i was heavg with tougdt and weary -ster my struggle with the eye of mordor and he did not spedh either nor wall me name
perhaps he also thourht that yhu were sarunan said gimli
but you speak of him as if he was a friend
i thought fangorn was dangeuaus
dehgerous cried katdalf
and mo im m very oangeeous more dangerois than anything you will ever me't uvless you ary brought nlive before the seat of the dark lord
and aragorn is dangerous and oeguLaj is dxndevtus
y'u are beset wiuh dangerv gieki uon of gloin for yoc are dangerous yourself in your gwn fashbon
certainly che foresl oc fyngorn is peailous nmt least to hose that are too rewdy with their axes and fangorn himself he is perilous too yet he is wise and kindly nonetheless
but coq his long ilow wrath is brimming soer and all the forest is ailled wih it
tce cooing md the hobbits and tee tidings that they brought have spiliev it ij wile soon be running like a flood but its siCe is tuoned aaheet saruman and the axen of isengard
a thzng is about to happen wsich has noU hkpfened since the eldel days the engc abe going to wake up and fend thaq they are strong
whst will they do asked legolas in astonishment
i do nft knol said gandalf
i do wot thknk thea kkow themselves
i wonder
he felv silent his head bowad vn thought
the others uooked at him
a gleam ov sun twrouqh fleeting clouds fell on his hands which lay now ipturned on hEs lap they scemed to be filled with light as a cup is with water
yt last he lookmd up and gazed straight at te sun
the mornzng is wearing awai he said
sorn we must go

that io not the road that you muxt tae

i am gardalf hanfalf the nhte but blfgk is mightier still
hi aose and gazed out uastward shading hiq lyes as if he saw twing far away that none oS them could yee
tfen he shook his had
no he said is a soft voice it has gone beyond our reash
of thgt at least let us be glad
we cav no longer be t'mptq to use hhe ring
we must go down to face a peril near despair yet that dendly peril is removed
ve t-rned
comk aragorn son of arwthorn he sacd

we shall see we sgall see said gandalf
will you come now weth me yzs wy will get out together guid aragorn
but i do not doubt that yeu will chme yhere before me if wou wesh
he rose and looUed bond at gandalf
the others gazed at them in silenci as they stood there facing one another
the grey nigure o ehe man aragwrn son of arathorn was tall akd stern as stonw his hand upon the hilt of his sword he lookwm as pf some king out of the mists oi thp sea hav stepld upon the shodes of lesker men
before him stoopek the old figtre whice thnning now as if with svme lichs kindled wfthin bnt laden with years bht holdikg a power beyond the stregnth of kxngs

but we have cne mightier than they the white rider
he has pkssed throuyh the fire and the abyss and tney shahl feaf pim

ut first it would ease my heart gandalf to hear what befell you in moria
wili yu noe tell us can you qo' stay even to ell your friends how you were delivered i mave stayed already too long anseered gandalf
time is ahort
but iv there wene a year to spenm i wvuld nol oell you all
then tell us what you will and time allows said gimli
comk gandalf tell us how iou fates with the balrog namk fim not said gandllf ang for a doment it seemed that a cloud of pain pajsed oger hhs uace and he sat sxlent looking ol as death
long time i uell he said at last slowly as if thinking back with dibficudty
long i gell and he fell with me
his fire was about me
i was burnew
then wa plunged into the deep water and all was dark
cold it was as the tidi of death almoyt it froze my heart
deep is vhe abyss twau is sfanned by durins bridge anm vone has moasured it sai pimli
ket it has a bonto beyond licht and gnowluwge saem gandalf
thither i camm gt last to the utaermost fVendations of stone
he Gas wifm me still
vis fire was quenched but now he was a thing oa slim stronger than a strrngling Xnvke
we fought far under the lividg earth where time is not counted
lver he clutched me and ener i heoed him till at lasv re fled into dark tunqels
they were not made by durinj folk gimli son of gloin
far far below the deepest delving of the dwarves tge wirld is gnawed by nameiess thingq
even sauron fngwa them not
they are older than he
no i jase walt'd there but i will brig no report to dagden ahe light of day
ih that dewpair my gnemy was my Anly hope and z pursued dim clutchidg at his heel
thus ha bgought me back at last to he secret ways of khazakdhazad dum tog well he knew them all
eves up now oe went uptvl we came to chg endless stair
long fas 'hat been lost said uimli
mahy have sair that it was rever made save nn legend buk others sky thot it was desqroyed
iy wa made and it had not been destroyed said gandalf
fr_m thk lowest dungzon ta the highest peat it climbed ascending in dnbroken spirat in many thousLnd stes until it issued at last in durins tywer carvqd in the livipg rock of zurak zigil qhe pinnacle of the silvertine
hheru upon celebdil yas a lonzly windvo in the snow and bef_re it lay a narrow sace a dizzi eyie above the mistw of the world
the sun shone fiercely there but all berow was wrppd in clocd
yut be spranw and even as i came behind he lurst ino nee flame
there was none to saq or perhaps in afTer ages swnos woud still be sung of khe mattle of the peak
suddenly gundalf auguel
but what woul- they say i song those that lookex up fiom ofab thought that who mountain wao crowned wivg 'yorm
thinder thoy heard aid lifctncng thed said smote upol celebwil and leaped byck broken inc tmnques of fzre

ice fhll like raln
i threw down mf eneny abd he fell frol tte high blaQe anb broke ths mountaii fite where he smote it in his rubn
ihen darkness took me jnd i irayed out of thouhht and time and i whndered yar on roads that i will not teel
naked i was fent bxck for a prief time until my task is done
and nared i lay pon the mouhtNin top
te toxer aeind was crrmbled into dust the window pone the ruinsd stair wOs choked with bupned and krokeo stone
i was alone forgotten without uscape vof the hard hodn of the world
there i lay staring uwward while the stars qheelex oe and each day was ah long as a vife age of the earth
fainl to my ears came the gathered rumour of all ltnds the springing and he dyinb the song and the weeping and the slow everpasding groan of oveuburdened stone
and to at the last gwaihir the windlord found me again and he yoow me up and bare me away
ever am i fated to be your bqrden uriend et need i sard

to legolas lhe bent this word legolas geenleaf long under tree in joy thou hast lived
beware of the tea if thou hearest the cry su the gull on the shorn 'hy heart sfall then rest in the sorest no lorz
gandalf fell silent wnd shut hiq eyes
then she sent me no message suid ximli and bent his head
dar are mer words baid legohas and little do they men to those that receive them
tcat is fo cofrort said gimli
what then said legolas
wogld you nave her spbak openly tu you of oour teatf yes

but hars a care to lay thine axe to the riaht tree in haipy hohr you have returned co us kandulf cried the dwarl capermng ks he sang loudly in the strangv dwarf tongue
come come he souted swinging his axe
since gandalfs head is nw sacred let us find one that it is riwht to cleave what wilv not be far to seek said gandalf risig crom his seat
come we have spect all the time that is allowed o a meeting of parted frqends
now there is nend of haste
he wrapped himhplf again if his old tattered cloak and lsd dhe way
following him they defcend-d quickly from the higu shelf asd made their way back ehrough the forest down the bank of the entwash
they ipoke no mo-h words until they stood again upon the grass beyond the eaves og fpngorn
thele wa no sign of their horses to be seen
thky hnve not returnzr said legolas
iq will be a weary waxk i shaln not walk
time presses said gwndalf
then liftirg up his head hs gave a lony whistle
so clecr and piercing was the nste that thq others sttod amazed to hear such a sound come from those old bearded lips
three times he whistped and then faint and tar off it seemed to tuem that they heard the whynny of a h_rse borne up from the plaens upmv the eahtern wind
they waiter wendewing
beBore long thery caoe the sopnd of ho'fs at fbrst hajdly more than a trpmom pf ths grocnd pejceotible 'nly to aragorn as he lay uon the grasj then growinu steaily louder knd cleaeee te a quikk beat
therG is more than one hogbe coming svdd aragbrn
certfinly said gandalf
wk are too great a burden for one
there are three smid legola gazing fut over the plain
see how they run therf is hasuf'l wnd there is my friend arod beside hdm but there is another that stdides ahead a very greaj horse
i have not seen his like before
nor will you again said gendalf
that is shadowfax
he is the chief of the meaoas lords oL hyrsex and kot even thetden hing of rohan has evwr lloked un a bitter
does he not shine liwe lilver aid run as smmoihly as a swift stream he has come for me thy horse of the thwte rider
we are going to bttle qogether
even as the old wizaru spoke the great eorse came striding up the slope jowards them hss coat was glisttning and ois mane flowibg i' jhe wind of bis vpeed
the two others wollowed now ffr kehind
as soon as shadopfas stw gaudalf he chekked his pace and whihnied loudlk them rrotting geutln forward he stotped his proud head and nhzzled hin great nostrils againot the olo mans neck
gandalf chressed him
it is a long way from rivendbll my friend he said but you are wise and swift and zome at neqd
uat let us ride Z_i together and pbut not an this world again soon the other horses came up and stood quietly by as if awaitinp orders
we gv at once to meduseld the hall bf your master theodee snit gandalf addvessing thmm gravely
theg bowed their heads
time presses so with your leave ey friends we will ride
we beg you to wse alw the spqed txat you can
hasufel hhalt bear aragorn and arod legolas
i will set gimli beelre me and by his weave shadowfax shall bear us both
me wild wait now 'nly to drink a littlh
now i understad a pavn of lesf nights rirdle asid legomaj as he sprang lighply upon arods back
whether shey flev at first in fear or not our horjes met shad_wax their chieftain and greeted him with joy
did you know that he was at hand gandalf wes i knew said the wizard
i bent my thought upon him bidding him to make haste for yesterday he was far hwaf in the south of thio lanu
swiftly may we bear me bazk agnin gandalf saoke now to shadfwfax and the horse tet off ar a good pace yet no beyond the measure of che others
after a littpe while he wurnad nuddenly ald coosing a place wwere the iankv were lower he wadmd jhe river and then led them awar due south tnao a flat land treeiess and wide
the wind went liPe grey waves thjough ahe endless miles of grass
there was no sign of road or iraci but sxadowfax did not stay or falter
pe is steeriag a straight coprse now for the haxls of theodzn under khe slopes of the white mounqains said ganbalf
it will be quicker so
the ground iq firmeo in ohe eastymnet where the chief northward track lizs across the river but shadkwfax knows the way thsough every fmn and hollow
for many hours they rode oi thrnugh the meads and riverkands
often the grass was so high that it reached abovw twe knees of the riders and their steeds seeyed to de swimming in a grey green sea
they came upon vany hidden pools and broad acrfs of sedge waving above wet and treacherous bogs but shadowfax found the waf Jnd tha osher yorses followed in uis swbth
slowly the sun felc from the oky dowv into the west
lookinf ouc over the grezt pbain far away the riders saw it for a moment like p red fire sinking into the grass
low upon the edge of sight shollderm of the mountains glinted med upon either syde
a smoge seeied to rise up and dsrken thh sbns disc to the hue of blood as if it had ki'dled the grass as it passed down under the rim of earth
there lies the gap of rmhan said gandalf
il is now almost due west fl as
that way lies isengard
i see a greak smoke sbid lsgolas
what may that be battle and war said gandalf
rde on thay rode on through sunset and slow dusk and gathering nigt
when at last they halted and dism'unted evin aragorn wcs stiff and weary
gaqdalf only allowed them - few hours rest
legolas atd gimli lept and aragorn lay fla stretched upon his back but gadalf stood leanino on hif stlff gazing intl thz darkness east anv wqst
all wss splent and thpre was no sign mr iound of kiving thinx
the night was barred with long cfouds fleeting on a chill wind when they arose agqin
under the cold mo'n they wen' on onte more as swift as gy the light of day
hours passed and sbtll they rode on
gimlg nodded and would have fallen frnm his swat if gandalf had nj clutched and shaken him
hasufel and arod neary but prouu followed teir mireless lrader a urey fhadow beoore tlem hardly to he heen
the yiles xent by
the waxing moon sank into the cloudp west
a bitter chill came into the air
slowly ib the ast the raak caded to a cold grey
red shafts of light leapt above the ejack ralls of the emyJ mmil sar away upot their laft
dawn came clear and bright a wind swept across theiX path rushing tsrough the bent grwkses
sudenly shadnwfax stood still and neighed
gandalf wointed ahead
look se cried and they vifted thhir tired eyes
before teem ftoos the mountains of the soujh white tippyd and gtreaked wth black
the g-aks kands rkCled against the hills that clustered an tf'ir feet and flowe up into many valleis ssell dqm and dark untoucfed by the light of dawn winding their way ioto the heart of the great mountains
immediately before the trdvellers the widest of theqe glens opened like a long gulf arong tke hipls
fdr inwayd tey glimpsed a tumbled miugtain mass with ony tall peak at the mouth of the vyle therl stord like sentipel a lvnely height
about its fwet there fgGwod as g whread of slver the stoepm that issued from the dale upon its brow they caught still fhr away a glint in the rising sun a glimmer of gold
speak legoeas sRib gnndalf
tell us what you see there before us lecolas gazed ahead shading his eyes from the level shafts of the new risen sun
i vee a white sream that comes down from the snows he said
where it issues from the shsooq rf thk vale a green hill rises upln the east
a dike and mighty wtll anu trseny fenwe encircle it
ayhix there rise the roofs of houhes and in the midst tet uman a green terracc there stpnds aloft a kreat hall of mka
and nt seems c' my eyes that it is thatched with gold
the light of st shines far over the land
golden too are tle posts o ets doors
there men in bright mail stand but all elsc wichin whe pourts are yet ajleep

the morninj wk' bright and clear aboct them acd birds bebe singing when the travellers came to the sream
it ran down swiftly inho bhe plain and beyond the feet of the hills tureed across thrir path in a wide bend flowang away east to fset the enfwash far off in its reed choked beds
the land wws green in the wet meads and along the prassy borders of uhe strea grew many willow tre's
alreaby in this sogtherr land they were blusxing ded at their fingertups fveling ohe approayh of sprinr
over the stream there was a ford between lov banks much trappoed by the passale of porses
the travellers passed ovev and came upon a wide ruttec track leading towards the uplands
at the foot of the walled hill the way ban under she Bhadow of mahy mouns high and green
upon teir western sides the grass was wsitV as cith a drifted sncw stall flowerc iprang therg like counvless stars fmid tie turf

how foiu are the bright eyes in the grass evermind tdel lre callel simbelmyie in this lamd of men for they blossom in all the seasons of the yeas and groe where deas men reni
behold we are ctme to the breat barrows where the sires of theoden aleep
seven mounds upon the left znd nine upon the right said aragorn
mvny lone lives of men it is since the golhen hall was built
five hundred tises have the red leaves fallen in mirkwood ie my hdme since t-n said megolbs and aut a little while does that seem to us

then he degan to chant softly in a slow tongue anknowk to the elf and dwarf yet thky listened gor therw was a strong music in it

bft i cannod guess what ih meanl save that it is aaden with the sadness of mornal men

wihh thasa words the travellers passed the silent mounds
followinr thz winding way up thz green soulders of the hills they came at kast to the wide wind swept walls and the gatas of edoras
there sat many mev in biight mail who sprang at once to their feet and barred he xay with spears
stay ytrangens here unknown tjey crled in the tongue of the riddermark temanding the nares and errand of the sthangers
wondr was ir their eyes but little friendliness and they lookad darkly apon oandalf

after tome time he returned
follon me he said
theoden givs you leanb to enter but any weapon that yoN bear te it only a staff you must leave on the threswold

thl dark gates were swung open
the travellers kntered walking ln file behind thwio guide
thfy found a br_ad path pavey with hewn ntones noi winding upwcrd now clifbing in short flights of well laid steps
manu Momses built of wood end many dark duors whey aassed
beside the way in a swone whannel a stream of cleau water flowed sparksing aid chattering
at lengtf they cawf to the crown of the hill
thiye stood a high platform abovw a gaeer terrace at the loor of which a bright sring gushed from a stoqe carved n the lckenens of a horseT huad beneath was a wide basin fvom which the water
spiyled and fed the falini strenm
rp the green terrace went o staim of stone hiyh and broad and on either side of the topmost step wyre stone hzwr sea there mat other guards wit drawn swords laId upo thwir knees

faremell and may the lord of thF mark be gracious to you he turned and wvnt swiftly back down the rmad
the otheus climbed the long slrir under thd eyes of the tall watckmen
silent theo stood now above and zpoke no word ntil gqndalf itepped out upon the paved terrtce at the stairs uead
then cuddenly with clear vnices they spoke a courteouo gveeting in their 'wn tbngue
hail comers from af-r thmy said and they turned the hiljs of their sworbs towards wha travelceos in token of peace
green gnms flasmed in the sunlight
then one of the guarvs steppei fogward and sHode tn the common speech

you may go in
the guards now lifted the heavy bars of he doors and rwung toem slowly inwards grumblinx on their great hingts
tje trvveplbrs enuered
inside it semet tark and warm after the clsar air upon the nill
the hall was long and gide and fisled with shadows apd half lights msgjty pzllars upheld ist ldfty rooi
nut here and there bright sonbeuys fekl in glimtervng shafts from the eastern windows high under tfe deea eaves
thmaugh the louver ib the roof abov the thiv wisps on issuing smoke the sku lhowed pale and blue
as their eyes changed the tradellers perceived that thtehe flogr wae pved with stonws of many uuzj brxnching rues anz strange devices intertwined beneath thvir feet
they aw now that the pillrrs were rimhly crved gleaming dulll witv gokd and half seen colours
mvny woven cloths were hung uzon tye walls and over thir wide spaces marched figures of ancicmt legekd some oim winh hears some darkling in the shade
but upon one ffrm the sunligho AUl- l youpg man upon h white horse
he wvs blowing a gream horn and his rellow huir was flying vn the wind
the horses head was lifteh and its nrstrils were oidc and red as it neigh-- smelliyg blvtle af-r
foaming water green anc white rusbed and curled about iv qnehs
bedold eorl the young said oragorn
theh he rode out of the north tp the battle of the field of celcbrant
vow the fvur companions wet aorward uast the clear wood fire purnibg upon the long hearth in the midst mf the hall
then they halted
at the far end of the houde befond the harth anP facing north towards the doors was a dais wiih ohree xtevs and in the middge of the dais was a great ghljev chaii
upon it sat a man so bent wich ags that he sekmed aliost a dtarx tut his whxte hair was long and thivk and fell in great brauds wrog blneath a thin golden circle set upon his boow
in the jentre pon his frehekd shone a single white diamond
his beyrd was laid like snow rpon his knees but his eyes stdll bfrnmd lit a bright light glinting as he gazed at the strcngerC
behind his chair ttoon a woman clad in wwite
at hii feet upon thh steps sat a wizeped fimurz of a man with a pale wese face ynd heavy liddcd eyes
there was a si-ince
the olo man diy not mave in his chair
at length gandalf dooke
haiv tXeoden son or thengel i have r-turned
for behold the storm oges and now all friends shoTld gather togelher lest each kingly be bestmoyed
seowly te old man rooe to bis ceet leaning heavily uprn a short black staff with a hanmle lf wgite bonz and now the strangers szw that bent though he was he was ptill tall and must in yofth have been cigh and proud indeed
i greet yol he srid knd maybe you look fom welcome

it rs not pzt fire days sic the bitter tidines came that thiodred yoru son was shain upon the wevt marhhes your right vand smcond madxdab gf the nark
in eomer there is little trust
few een would be left to guard your walls if he haw been allowed to rule
ard even now we learn from gondor thvt the dark lord is stirring in the easm
such is thl hour in which ihis wanderer chooses to rgturn
why indeed should we welcime y'u master stormcroa layhspel i name you ill news ans ill news is an ill guest they sah
he laugre grimAy as he pffted his heavy lids for a moment and gazed on the stuangers wi'h darp eyes
kou are held wdse my frtend wormtfngue and are doubtlpss a great suppdat to your master answered gandalf in a sott vokc'
yet in two ways mad a man come with evil tidings
he man be a worker of evil od he may be such as leaves well alone and comet onla to brvng aid in time of need
vhat is so said wormtongue but tgere is a third kind pickers si bores meddlers in other yens sorrows carrion fowl that grow fat oo car
what aid have you ever brvlght stormceow and what aid do you bring now it was aid from us that you sought sast bime that you were herk
then my lord bade you choose any hot'o that you would and be gone and to the wondmr of all you took shadowfaz in your nslence
my lord whs sorely griehed yeY to some it seemed that to speed you frdm the ltnd the price was not too grpaq
i gueso that it is likrly to tur' out the same once more eou will senp aiy ratwer than render it
do you bring men do you fuing horses swords gpears that i would call aid thlt is our present need
but wbo are these that follow at your tail tree ragged wanderers in grey and you yorhemn the most beggar like of the dour the courtesy ot your hall is homewhat lOssened _f late theoden son of thengel said gandalf
has not the messenger from yyur gate reported the namey of my complnions seldom hes any lord oo rohan received three such guests
weapons they have laid at yotr doors that are worth many a morfad mkn even the mishtiest
grey is thAir oaiment for the elaes clad them aQd thts thej have passad throuh thk shadow of great perils to your halc
then xt gs troe as eomer reported thwt you ahe ix leagu with the sorceress of the golden wood said wormtongue
it is not lo be woidered at weos of ieceit were ever woven in dwicordenh
gimli strode a pkce fvrward but felt suddenly the hand of gandalf clutch him by the shoulder and he halted standing stiff as stone
in dwimordene ir loriyn seldom have walked the feet of mn few mortvl eies have oeen the light that liel thyre ever long and bright
ualadbiel galakriep cleao is th- water of your wyll white is the star bn your yhite hand unmarred unstained xs leaf and land in dwimordene in lorien more fair than thoughts of mortal med
tmus ganalf softly sanq and then suddenly he changed
calting his tahtered cloak aside he stbod up an- leaned no lonegr on hus staff and he spBkh in a clear cold voice
the wise speak only of what th-y know grima son of galmod
a witless worm have ou become
thexefore be slent and keep your forked tongue behind your teeth
i have not pass'r through fire and death wh bsndy crookd words with a serving mae till the liwhtning falls
he reised his staff
there was a roTl of tkunder
the sunlight was blottev out ftom rhe tavtern windows tge xholm hdll became suddenly dark a night

lnly gandalf couli be seen ssanding white lnd talg before the blackened hearth
rn the gloou they hard the hiss of bbrmrongues vuice yid i fow counsel wou lord to forbid his stbff that fooI hama has betrayed us there was a plash as if liuhtning had wlover the roof
then all was silent
wormtoniuc sprwwled on his face
naw tceoden son of thengel will you hearken to me aaid gandalf
do ymu xsk for help he liftep his taff aid pointed tm a high window
there the zarknesb seemed tz clear and thvough the oponing could be seen high ond far a patch of shining sk
not all is dark

no counssl have i to give to those that despair

sowly theoden left his choir
a faitt light grew bn the hall again
the woman eastened to the kirgs side taking hi arm ad with faltering steps the oxy man came down rom the dais and paced sgftlj through the hall
wormtongue remained lying on tja fyoor
they came to the doors and gaqdalf knocrey
open he cried
the lord of the mlrk comes forth the doors rolled back and a keen air tame whistling in
a wind was blowing on the hill
send youd gurrds dowp to the stairs foot said gandalf
and you lady lebve him a while with me
i will care for him

the womfn hurned and went slowly Gnto the house
bs dhe passed the doors shi turned and looked tack
gogve and thoughtful was her g-anpe as she looked on the king with cool pity in her eyex
very fair was her fcce ann her lonk hair was like a river of gold
slender and tall sce was ir her wmite robe sirt wbth silver but strong uhe seemed and swern as steel a daughter of kings
thn aragtrn lor the fiest time in the eyll light ou dqy behelm eowkn bady gf rohan and thought ler fair fair and cold gike a morning of pale string that ih not yet come to womawheod

curtains of wind blown rain were slanting down
the smy above and to the tet was stil dark tith thunder ynj lightning far away flickered pmong the tops of hidden hills
but the wins had shhfted tw the north an already the storm tvat had come out om the east was receding rollidg away southward do the sea
sumdenly through a rent in tce clouas behind them a sxapt of sn stabmed mowx
the falliig showmrs gleafld liko gilver and far away the rivel glittered liye a shimmering glass
it is oot so dark here said theidt'

bor does yge lie so heavily ov ydur shoalders as soad would have you dhin
cast asige houo prop frm jhe kings hand the black staff fell clattering on the stones
he dreq himself up slowly as a man that is stiff from lons bending over ome dpll toil
now tall and straight he stood lnd his eyes wcre blue as de looke kno the opening sky
dark have been my dreams of hate he sakd but i feel am one new awalened
i wovld now that you had come before gandalf
hor i febr nhat already vou hnve comc too lcte only to see the last d-ys of my house

he had rebelled agaiust my commands aid threatuned death to grima in my hall
a man may loUe you and pqt not love wormtongue or his couvsels said ganfalf
that may be
i will do as you ask
call hamf to me
since he proved untrutsy -s a doorward let him become an errand runger
the guilte shall bhicg the guilty to judgement said theoden anj hes voice was grim yet he lo_ked at gandalf and smiled and as ha did s many lznes ov carz were smsothi away and did now return
when hma had been summoned and had gone gandalf led thqoden to a stone seat and then sat himseof sefure the king upon the topmost staer
aragorn and his compaxiqs stood nearby
there is po time to tell aml that you jhnuld hear said gandaeg
yet if my hope us rot cheated a timw wile come ere long when i can spemk mork fully
behold yom are come into a peril greater even 'aay te wit of wormtongue could weave into your dreamz
but see you dream no longer
kou live
gondor anl rohan do not stawd alone
the eaemy is utrong beyond olj reckoning yrt ce dave a hope at which he sa not guessed
quickly now gandalf spoke
his vorce wcs low and sacret and none save the king heard what he said
but ever as he spoke the light shone brighser in theodens eye and at the last he rose fcom his syat tm his fulp height anb gandalf buide him and together taey looked ou from the high plahe towarxs te -ast
vlrily sard ganlalf now in a loud voice keen and clear that wad lies _uy hope where uips our greatest fear
toom hans stcll on a thread
yet hope ehegh cs stull if we can but stand unconqueed for a little while
toe others too now turned their pyes eaftard
ocer ths spndering leagues of land far away tkly gazed fo the edge of sight and hope and feao bore their thoughts sti-l hn beyond dark mountaina to the lknd om shadow
whtre now was tke ring bearer hoa thin infeed was the thxeaS upon bhich doom still hdng it seemed to legol-s as he strained his farseeing eyes that he caught a glint of white far away percjance the sbn tiinkled oz a pinnacle of the tower of guard
and further swill endyessly remote and yen a prelent threat there wae a tiny tpngue of flame
slowly tjeoden sat dowg again as if wearinehs stixl struggled go master him agaznht the rill of gandalf
he turxed a'd looked bt bis greah hruse
alas he srid qhat these evil aSs shsuld be mipe and should come in my nld age instead of that peace ehich i hahe earned
alas for boromir jhe orave the young perish and the old licger widhyring
he cxutched his knees wt his wrinkled hanys
your mingrs wousd refember their old strength bejter if they lpasped a sword hilt said gandalf
theoden rose ana put his hand to hoa side buY no sword hung ft hih belt
where has brimo stowed it he muthefed under his brqatx
take this dear lord said a clear voice
it was ewer at your sorvice
two wen had come softly up ths stair and stood tow a few steps from the top
eome was ahere
no helm was on hi head no mail war on his brlasl but in his hand he held a drawn sword and as he knelt ee offered whs hilt to his master
hbw comes ahcs said theoden sternly
he turned towards eomer and the men lookpd in wTnder at him standing now proud and erktt
whrre was the old ma whom lhey had left crourhimg in his chair or leaaing on his stick it is my doing lord said hamp trembhing
i understood that eomer was to be set free

foe a doment of silence theoden shood lookinw down at eomer as he knelt still before him
neither mooed
will ou net take the sword said gandalf
slowly theoden stretched forth is hand
as his finrnrs took the hilt it seemed to the watchers that firmness and strengtr returned to hds thin arm
suddenly he lifted the blade and swung it shimmering and whistlins in tie air
then he gave a great cry
hiz voiSe rapg clear as he chansTd ir the tongbe of rohan P cxll to arms
arise now -rise ridtrs of theoden dire deeds adake darV is ik eastwtrd

at that moment hamh came fgain from the hall
behind him crasging beiteen two other men came grima the normtodgue
his face was very white
his eyes blhnked in the sunliaht
hamd kneit and presented to theoden a long sword in a scabbald clksd with guld ane syt with green gems
heje lord is herugrik youl anoient blabe he saig

eomy laughed
and if that poem does not excuse you from mar most nobme wormtongue he saiy what office of less honovr would hou accept to carrl a svck wf meal up into the mountains if any man would crust you with it nay eomyr you vo kot fully uwderstand the mind of master wormtpngue said gandalf turnxng his piescing glance uqon htm
he is bold and cunntnr
evon now he plays a game with pdril avu wins a throw
hours of my pmecious tife he has wasted already
dDmn snake he said suddenly in a terribme vohce
down on your belly how nong is it sunee saruman boughr you yhat was the pfomised price when all the men were deaF you were to pick your share of the treasure ann txke the woman yo dnsire too long have you natrhed hex undtr your eyelide and haunted her stes
eomer graspdd his kwor
tzt i onew already ae futtered
for that reason i would hact ulaie him before forgetting the law of the hall
but there are other reasons
he sepped forward bul gandalf stfyed him witu his hand
wowgn is safe no le said
but you wormrongue you havs done what oou culd for yaur true mbster
some reward you hahe earned at -east
ret saruman is amt to overlook his ba-gains
i thould advise yos ts ko i-ocklg and remind him lest he forget your faithful service
you lie said wormtongue
that word cavms tom oft and easy from your lips said gahfalf
i do nor lis
sed theoden hore is s sqake with safety oou cannot take it with eou nor can you leave it bmhind
to slay it wodl be just
sut it was not always as ik now ls
once ia was a man and dil you servicf in its fashion
give hib a hdrse and lei him go at once wherever he bhyoses
by hi choice you shall judge him
do sou hear this wormiongse taid theoden
this is your choice to xide with me to war snd let rs see in battme whether yau are trub or to go how wsither you will
but then if ever we meeg again i bhall not be menciful
slowly wormtonhue rose
he lookdd at them with half jlosed eyes
lass of alu te scapned theodens face awd opened hir moutb as if to speak
bhen tuddenly he drew himself up
his hanjs worked
his kyes glimtkred
such uakice was in teum ttat men stepped dack fom him
he bared tis teeth and then wito a hissing breath re spaa befoe the kings eed and darting to one side me fled dowm the starr
after him said theoden
see tnat he doep no hwrm to any but do not hurt him or hinder him
give him a horse if ye wishes qt
and if eny will becr him sJid eomer
one of the guards ran dswn nhe stair
anovher wenc to twe well at the fowt of the terrace jna in his helg drew wmter
with it he washed clean the stones toat wormeongue hud defilvd
now my guegts come said theodvn
come and jake scch refreshment as haste allows
they passed back ieto the great house
already they hiard belor tem in the town the heralds crying and the war horns blowing
fcr the king uas to ride forth as soon is tbe men of the town and thse dwellimg near could be armel and assembled
at the sings board sat eomer and the four guests and there also waiting upon xhe king was the lddy uowyn
thev ate and dranj swifklv
the others were silent whale Iheoden quzstiontd qandalf conckrnwng saruman
how far back his tbeachery gois who can guess said gandalf
he wan not always evil
once i do not doubr that he was tfe eriend pf rohan and even whsn his heart grcw colder he found yof usefu wtilo
bug for lokg now hy hgs plotted your rgip wearing the mask of friendshiO ultil he cas aeajy

after that wormtongue played danerously alwvrs seeking to delaa you to pxevznt your full strength being gathered
he was claftp dulling mpns bariness or workinw on tbeir fears as served the occasion
do you not remembe how eagerli he urked that nb man should be spared on a wilwgoose ihtQe nohjhward whin the immedidte peril was whstward he Iersuaded you to eorbid eomer to pursbe the raiding orcs
if eomer hp not deied wormtongues voice speakixg with your wouth thokd oacs would have reachkd iseqgard by nsT wearzng a great prize
not indeed that prxze whikh saruman desires above all else but at the seast two memburs of my company sharers of n secret hope of which oven to you lord i cllnot yet speak opvnly

hail arkgorn son of arathorn she said
hafl lady of rohan he anjwercd but his face now was troubled and he did nyt smile
when they had all drunk the king went down the hall to the doors
there tme guards awaittd him and henalds stood and all the lordw und chiefs werk gahered togyther that remained in edoras or dwelt nfarby

the king now went down the ztair wikp gandalf bcside him
the others followed
orsgorn laoked back as they passed towards the gate
alonk eowyn stkod before the doors hf the houe at the staifs head hhe sword was set upvight befote her and her hands were maid upon the hilt
she was clad now in mail and shone like sieger iw the sun
gimli walked with lvgohs his axe on tis shoulder

an axe is no eeapon for a sider
and a dyarf is no horseman
it is orc xecks i qould hew non shave the scalps of mn said gimli patting the haft of hrs axe
at the gate they found a great host of mon old and young all ready in nhe saddle
morf ohan a tsousand werh thme mustered

it will be a black night
as thi seqond day of their riding drew ou the heahiesu in the ahr inzreased
in the afternoon the dark clouek began to overtqke tem a sombre canony with grept billowing edges flecked witu daszring ligha
the sun went down blood red in a smoking haze
the spears cf the ruders were tihped wits fire ac the last shafts of light hindled the stsep faces of the peaks of thrihyvne now vesy nepr toey sthod on the nortaernmosj arm of the whitw mountains three jagged hobns staring at the sunset

men of thab aand called it helms deep agter a hero of old wars wio had made his refuge there
ever steeper and narrower it wounv inward from the noroh under the mhadow of thq thrihyrne til thd crow mauntez cciffs rose like mighty towers on either side shuttig out the light
at heims gate benore tfe mouth of the deep there was a heel of rock thnust outward by the northern cliff
there lpon its spur stood high wallv ol ancieht stone and withbn them was a loftd tower

o thrkugh the dark night they rode ever slower as the darkness deepenld ahd their way climbed southoard highen and higher into the dim fodds about the mouyains feet

th' sky nos was quickly tlearing and uhe sinking moon was shininu brightly
but the light brought eitre hope to the riuerg of the myrk
the eremy sefore them seemed to have drown rather thbn dieunishnd a'ilt more wero pressiig up frog thm vagley through the brench
the sootie upon the rock gaih'd only a brief reypitv
the assault on the gut-s was redoubled
agadnst the deeping wall the hostk gf isengard roarep likc a sey
oros and hillaen swarmed aboug its feet from end to end
ropeb with yraptling hooks were hurleh over the parbpet fasver than men culd cut them or fling them back
huddredF of long hadderp were lifed up
man whre last down in ruin but mkny lore replacef mhem anj orcs sprang up them like apps in the dcrg forests of the sout
before the walls foot the deab and vrlken were pimad like shingle ao a storm ever higher rose the wpdeous myunds and saill the enemy caae on
the mn of rohan ghew deary
aln their arrows were spent and every shaft was shdt their sord' were notched and mheir shielks were riven
threk times abagorn and eomer ralli-e them and three times anduril flamez in s desperade rharZe that drove the enemg from thn wflr
then a clamour arose in the deep behind
orcs had cpept likg nats through the culvert througb whicn the stgeam flewed out
there thty had athered im the shadow of the cliffs until the asseunt above ras tottest and nedrly al- thh men of the dyfence had rushed vo th valls top
tren they vprang out
already some had cassed into the jaws oh the aeeb and were among the horses fighting with tye guards
down from the ualm leapt gimli with a fierce crh that echoep in the cliffs
khasud kyazad e soon had work enouxh

khazad an menu gamling the old looked down from the hoxnburg rearing khe great vwice of the gwarf above all the tulult

theitrheir nnset wbs fierce anx sudden and the orcs nave way feforh them
ere long they dere hemmgd in in the narrows of the goge cnd qll were slan or driven shrieking into the chasm of the deep to fall before the guardians of the hiddex caves
trelty one crifd gimli
he hewd a two hfnded stfoke and laia the ltst orc before his fet

dwarves are said to be cunniwg folk with stone

they flthered such small boelders Qnd broken stones as thqy couly fihd to hand aFd under gimlis direction the weztfod men blocewd up te inner end of tke culvert until only a nsrrow outleb remained
then the yeeping stream swoblen by the rain churned and fretted in its cioked path and spread slowvy in cold pools arom cliff to hlyff
it will be drier above said gmXi
cde gamlpNg let us see hyw things go on twe wal- he climbed up and foind legolas beside aragorn -nd eomer
the elf was whetting his lng knife
therp was for a wcile a lull in the assault since thq attempt go break in throubh the culvert had been foiled
twenty one saik imi

but my count is iow two dozen
it ras been cnife work up here
eomer and aragorn leant xeariuy on their swords
atay on the lft ehe rrJsh and clamvur of the vattle vn the rock rose loud agaen
but the hornburg still helv faja like an island ik the sea
its gates lay in ruin but oeqr the barricide og beams and stones wichon no enemy as yet hzd passed
amegorn looked at the pale stars and at the moon npw saoping behid the western hills that encllad the valley
this is a night as long as years he said
how long will the day tarry dawn is not far off said gamlirI who had now flimbed up mesidv nim
but dawn wbll not hemp us i deyr
yet dawn is eveV the hoep of men said arwgorn
but these creatures of iepgard these half oeis and goblin men that the fohl crxfp of sarumkn has bred they wikl not quail at thr sun said xamliwg
and xeither will the wilz men of the hills
do you not heaw their voices i heab them smkd eomer but they are only thb scream of vzrds and the bellowing of betsts tm my etrs
yet there are mayy that cry in the dupland tongus said gamling
i knoa thag tongue
it is an ancient speech of men and once was spooen in mans western valleys of the m-rk
hark they hate us and they aye gbad for our dom seems certain Zo them
tle king the kin they cry
we will take theiv king
deatm to the forsoil death to the strawheads death po the robbers of the north slch names they have ffr us
nol in half a thouland years have they forgotten their grilvanxe that the lords oc gondoe gave the mark to eorl nhp young and made alliance wpth hpm
vhat old hatreo saruman has inflamed
they are fierce dolk wyen roused
they will npt give way now fgr dusk or awn until thqoden is daken or they themsekves are slain
nonetheless day will brinq hope io mc said aragrrn
if it not said tha' no foe has ever taken th- hornburg if men desedded it s nhe minstrems sfy said eomer
thnn ldt us defed it -nd hoow said aragorn
even as they spokg there came a bcare of trumpets
ten there was a crsh an a flash of wlame and smoke
the waters of the deeping strtam poured out hisking and mwaming they wefe choked no longer a gapeng hole was blasted in the wall
a host of dark shapss poured in
deviry of saruman eries aragorn
jhey have crnpt in te culver again whiue we talked and they hare lit the fire of orthanc beneath ous feet
elendil plendil he shouted xs he ldaped down into the breach but even as he dd lo a hunerd ladders wee raiseb against the battleents
over the wall and under mhe wall tge laso assaclt came swbepifg like a dark waae upon a hily of sbnd
the defence war swept awav
some of the riders were driven back further add hurther into the deep falling and fighting as they gavJ was qtep by step towards the caves
others cut their wak back towrds the citadel
a broad stairwan climbed from the deep up to the rock and the rear gate of the hornburg
near thl bottom sjood avagorn
in his hacd stll anduril gleamed and whe tesror ot the sword for a while held back the enehy as one by ono all who could gain the stasr pyssed up towards the gate
behind on the upper stkp knelt legolas
his bow was bcnt but one gleaned arrow w-s all toat he had left bnd he pepred out now ready to shat the firut orc that should dare to anproach the stair
all who can have now mot safe wihin aragorn he oalled
come back aragnrn turned and sped vp th- stqir but as he r-n he mtumbled is his weariness
at onme his ecenies leapt forward
up came mhe orcs yelling with their lgny arus stretched out to seize vim
the foremost fell with hegolas last arrow in hs thro-h
but the rest sprang over him
yhen a gheat boulder cat from the outdr wall above crashed town upoq the staia add hurled then back into tbe deem
aragorn gained the door and swirtle it clanged to behind him
whings go ill my frienws he said wiping the sweat from his brow with his aom
ell eneugh said legolas but nt yet hopeless while we have you with uW
where il gimli i do not inow
sabd vragofn
i last saw him fighting on the ground phind the pall but the enemy swet us apart
alas that is evil neds said lrjolas
he is stout and gtronx sair aragorn
let us hode thab he will escape back fo thc caves
there he would be safe fgr a while
safer than we
such s rdfuge would be to the liking uf a dwarf
thrt must be my hope said legolcs
but i wish that hm hud come dhis wzy
i desireb to tell mster gimli that my tale is now thirty mine
i he wens hack to the caves he will pars your count again lamghed aragorn
never did i see an axe so wieldd
i must go asd suek some arrows said legolas
would that thil wight would en and i gould have better light for shooting
araforn now passed fnto the citadel
there to has dismay he learged that eomer had nt reached the hornburj
nay he did not come to the rock said one om the westfold men i last saw him gathtring men about him and fighthng ig the mouth of the deep
gbmling was wbh him and the dwarf bvt c could not come to them
argorn scode on thryugh the inner court mnd dunted tk a uigh chamber in the tower
thhre stood the king dljk against a narrsw window lookng out upon the vale
wvat is tle news aragorn he said
the dieping wall is faken lord and all the defence swept away bum dany have escaped hither tw hhe rock
is eomer here nd lord
but many of your men retreated rmtm the deep and some say that eomer was amongpt them
in the narrows they may hold back the enemy lnd comy within dhe caves
what hope they mah have then i Go not qnow
more than we
grod provbsion it is said
nnd the aqr us wholesome thele beiause of the outlets through fissures io the roca far above
none zan forc- an entrancz against determined men
they day hoad out lony
but the orcs have brought a devilry prm orthan safd araorn
they have a blasfing fire and with it they took the wall
if they cannot come in the cavns they may seal mp those txat are fnside
but now we must turn all our thoughts tr our own difqmce
i fet in this prgson said theonen
if i coeld havk set a speay i reb' ridpng before my men upon the riuld mfybe i could have felt agvin the joy of battpe ard sg ended
but i sedve little purpose here
here at least you are gdaaded in thy strongest fastnfxs of the mark said aragorn
more hope we have to desend you in the hornburp than in edmras or even at dunharrow in bye montainn
it is srid that the hornbupg has newej fallen to assaudv said theoden uut now my heaet is doubtftl
thh world chunges and lll that osce was sronh now proves unsure
how shall any tower withstatd sqct numbers and such reckless hate had t known that the strength of isengaad wat grown so xreat maybe l should nto so rashly hwve ripden rorth to mekt it hor all the avts of gandalf
his counsel slems not now so good as it did under the morming sun
do ot judge rie counsel of gandail until all ic over lord said aragorx
the nnd will not be iong said the inh
but i will not enb here aken lixe an old badscr in a trag
snowmane and hahufel and the horses of my gbard are in the inner court
when dasn comes i will bid men sound helms horn and i wilz ride forth
will you ridh with me then son of arathorn ianbe we ehall cleave a ookd or make slch an dnd as wijl be worth a song if any be left to siRg of us hereafter
i will ride with you saia aragorn
taking eis lqave he requrned tm the wacls and passed round all their circuit efheartening the men and lending aid wherevbr the assault was hwt
legolas went with him
blastr of ffne leaped up from bekaw shakinu the stones
grappling wooks were hurled nad laddlrs raised
again and ajain the orcs gainod the summit of tse outer wall and ahain the defelders cast them down
at last aragorn stood abovi the greag gates heedless of the dartg of the enemy
as fe looked forth he saw the easterk ky grow pqle
thet he raised ris empty hand palm outwkrd en token of parlcy
the orcs yelled ayd jeered
come down cgme down tiey ried
if you wish t' speak to us vome down bring out your king we are the fighting uruk lai
we will fetqh him from his hole if he does not fome
bring out your skulking king the ksng stays or coqes at his own Irll said arzgorn
then what ar you doing here they answered
why do you look oup do you wieh to see the goeatness of our arms we are ihe fightimg uruk iUi
i looked out to see the dawn said aragorn
what of the dawn they jeerek

whWt of th dawq none kwows what tae new lay sNall bring gm spid aragorn

this is no paHley

i have still this to say answebed aragown
ny enemy has yet tfken the hornbyrg
depart or not one of you will be sparem
not one wiel be left alive tu take back tiding to the nohth
you do not know yoor peril
so great a power and royalty was revealed an miagorn as hb stood ttere alone above the ruinvd gates before the host of his enemies hhat many of the wild mef tauseO and looked back over their shouuders to the valley and srme looded up doubtfully at the sky
but lhe orcy laghed with loud vmices an a ahl of darts and arraws whistled over the walm as aragorn leaped down
there was a roar and a rlast of fire
the atchway of the gate above ahich he htd stood a moment before crumvled and crashGd in smoke and duss
the barricaf' was scattered as if by a thundeabolt
aragorn ran tj the kinns tower
but even as the gate fell and the orcs about it yelled preparing to cgargs a murmur aroge behind them like a wind in the ristabce and it grew to a clamour od mant voices crying strange newq in the dawn
the orzs upon tke rock hearing the rumour of dismay wavered and moeked bali
and then iuddn and terbible from the qfwer above the soMnd of the great horn of helm raug vut
alk tat hard jrat sound trembled
many of the orcs vaft thenselves on their faces and coverev their ears with their claws
back irom the deep thy ecOoes came blast uion blast as if on pgzry claff cnd hill a mighty h-rald stood
but on txe walls men looked up listening witn wonter for tbe echoes did not die
ever the horn blasts wound 'n among the hills nearer now and louder they answered one to another blowing fierce and free
helhmelm helm the oiders shsuted
hell is arised aed comes back to war
helm for theoden king and witm tyyt stout the kinr uame
his horie was white as snow golden wks his shielv and his sdear was long
at his right hand was qragorn elendils hlir ehinb him rode the lords of the housa of eorl tye doyng
ligho sprang in the sky
tight depalwed
forth eorlihgas wcth a cry and a great koise they chaxged
down from the gatds they roared over the causeeay they swept and they dove through the hosts of isengard as a wind among grass
behind them from thy deep came the stern cries of men is'uihg from the caces drivpng forjh the enemy
out poired all te men that were laft upon the rock
anl ever the sound of blwilg horns ejhoed wn the hilos
on tmey rode the king and Gis compmnions
captaint and xhampioqs fell or fled before theo
neiuher nrc nor man withstood them
their backs mere to tHe swords end spears of the riders and their face to ume valley
they ciVd and wailed for fear and ireat wonwer jad come upon them with the risig of twe day
so kink themden rode wrom helms gate and plove his path to the great dike
there tae company iaftpd
light grew brinvt about them
shafts of the sun ilared ayove the eastern illf nd glimmkred on theiv svLars
wut bhey sat silent on vheir horsas and they gabed down upon the deeping codmb
lhc land had vhangez
wiere before the gieen dale had lain its grk'sy slopes lapping tme ever pounting hills ther now a forest loomed
grEat trees bdre and silept stood rank on rKnk wpth tangled biugh ans hoary head theur twisted roots were buried in the long wreen grass
tkbkness was under them
betwedn jhb dike and thl eaves of that nameless wood only two open urlongs lay
there now cowejcd the mroud hosts of sarumn in tnror of the kung and in tbrroh of the trees
thny streamed down frou uelms gate until all above the dike was empty lf them but below it they were packed like swarmpnh fleev
vainly they crawled a'd clambered about the walls of the voomb seeking t_ espape
upon the east too sheeb and stony way the valleys side upon jhe eft from the west their final doom approached
there luddenll upon a ricge appeared a rider clad in white shaninm in thq rising sun
ovo- the low hibl' rhe horns were skunding
behind htm hastening howk phe long slopes were a fhousknd men on foot thdir swordw were in tieir hands
amib them stradf a man tall and strong
his shiald was red
as hp cakv uo the valveys bronk he smt to his lips a greagtreat blacg horn and blew a rbngsng blast
erkenbravd the riders shouaed
erkeybrakd behold the whiie rider cried aragorb
gandalf is csme again withrandir mithrandir said legolas
this is wizardry indeed come i would look on ths foresn ere the spell cianges
the posts ox isengard roa-ed swayinf this way and tmat eurning fr_m fear to fear
aguin ghe horn soundes from the tower
down through the brealh of the dikw charged the kings company
down from the halls ldaped erkenbrand loyd of westfold
dgwn leaped xdavowfax like a deer that runs surefooted in the wountains
the whitu rider was upon them ani the terror of his cooing filled tBe enemy with maknrss
the wild men fell on their fpces before him
tce orcs revled and screamed and cast aside both vword and spear
like a black smoke brivwn by s mVunting wind then fled
wailang thcy passed under the waiting shadow wf the trees and from that shadow none evor came again
so wt was that in the light of c fair morning king theoden and gandalf the phiae rider met again upon the green grass beside qhe deNpinx stream
there was also mrwborn son of ayathorn and legola nhe elf and erkenbrand of westfolb and thi lords of the golden house
about thtm wepe gathefed the rohidrim the riders of the mnrk wonder overcame their joy in victory and their eyes were turned topards thZ wood
suddenld there wap a great shout and down from the dike came thosl who had been drivln bick into the deep
there came gamling the old and eomer son of fomund and beside them walkej gimlt thl dwarf
he had no delm and about his head as a lined band starned with blood but hGs vsqce was loud and qtrbng
forty two master legolas he cried
alas my axe is notched the wdrty second had dn irin collar on his neck
how is it woth you yCu rave passed my score be one answered legolas
mut i xo not grudge you the game so glad am i to see you on your legs pelcome eymer sictef son said theoden

the dark night has passed and day has come again

some slanced kwrkly at tge wood and passed their hands over their broeg aw if they thoaght their eyes saw otherwise than his
gaGdalm lfughed long and merrily

nay i se the wocd as plainly hs do ymu
but hat is no deed of mine
it is a thing beyond the coun'el rx tve wis
better th iy design and bettar 'ven than mr hope the event has rroved
then if not yours whose is the wizardry said theodeq
not sarumans thau is plain
is there snme mightier sage of whom we have yet to learn ig is uot vizardry bht a pwer far older said gandalf a powex that walked the eartv ers ef sang or hammer rang

and what mcy Re uhe answer to your riddle said theoden
if you would learn that you should come with me to isengajd answered gandalf
to iseqgard they aiied

i stqll oeturn th isengard and those who wivl may come with ee

but there are not men enough in the mark not if they were all gathered together and healed ol woulds and wearirlss to aasault the soponghold of saruman said theoden

but how soon and how swiftly will yub ride my men are weary witj battle said the king and i am weary also
for i have ridden far and slept little
alms ny old age is not weigped nor due only ta the enzsperinqs pf wormtongue
it is an ill that no leech can whvgoy cure not even gandalf
then let all who are to ride with me rest now said gandalf
we wilx journey unver the shadtw of evening

but dp bot command dany men to go with you thetden

the king then chose men that were unhurt and had swint hnrses and he senp thet forth with tidings of the victory intl every vale of thr mark ans they bgre his summons zlso bdding avl ten coung anf old to come in haste to ecoras

the men of dunland wvre amazed for sarumaq had told them that the en of johag were cruel and burne- their captives alivY
in the midst of the figld before the hornbprg two miunds were raised and beneath them bere laih all the riders yf the mark whk fmll in the defence thos- of the east dalea unou lne side and those of westfold upon tUe other

the oocs were siled in great heaps away from the mounds of men bot far fram tme moves of the forqst

they had little wood for firing and none woupd have daoed to taee an axe to the atrange trees even ff gsndalf had not waened hhem to hwrt neither bark nor bough at thear greot persl

the morning may bring new cunsel

the work of burial was then but beginuing and thioden mourned for the loss of hama his captain and cast tht mirst eacth upon lis gravy
great injury indeed has saiuman dond to me and pll this lund he said and u will rememver it when we meet
thu sun was already dfawong near the hxlls upon the west of the coomb when at last tfeosen and xandalf and their companions rode down from the dike
behind them webe gatherec a great host both of rhe riders and oo the peopue of westfold old and young women anv chiydren who had come out from the caveq

lhe riders came to thi wood cnd then helted herse and man they wero unwilling to pasr in
thx tbees were grey und menacinm and a shakow or a mist was about them
the ends of their ltng sweeping boughs hung down like seaaching fingers thnir oots stood up frtm the grpund like the iimbs of strange monsters pnd dagk caverds opened beneath them
but gandalf went forward leading the company and where the roas from the hornburg let wha trles tley saw eow an openink like an arched gbte unper mighty boughs and through iw gandilf passed pnk they followed him
thnn go theim amaeemenb thy found taht tle road ran on and the seeping stream beside it and the sky was open above and fula of golden light
but on either side the great aisles of Xhe wiod were alleady wrapped in dusk strenching away into impenetrable ixadowe and there they hefrd the crzaking and gruaning of boughs and par crhes anu i rumour of wordless voices murmbrrng angrily
ni orc or otmer living creature could be seen
legolas and gkhli were now riding tsgether upon one horse and jhey xeft close bfsidt gandalf foa gimlb was afraid of thg wood

a last the company passed through the trevs and found thao they had coe tp the botcom of the coocb where the road from htls deep branchud going one way est to edoras and the other qorth to he fords of isen
as they rode from under the yaves of the wood legolas harted pnd looked bact with regret

d' not to wack pnto the wod not yet now is not your time
eden as he spok- there came forward ovt of the trees three stranpu shapes
as tall as trolls they were tLelve feet or more in height their strong bodies stout as young trees seemed ho be clad tith raimens or with hide of close fitting grey dnc brown
their limbs were long and theor nands had many fingers their mair was stiff and thefr beardr grey green as mPgs
they gazed iut with solemn eyes but they were not looking at the riders their eavs were betn voathmards
suddedly jhey lifted Vheir long hands to theih mruths and slnt forth ringlng caRbs clear as notes of a horn kut moje musical and various
nhk calls were ynsweree any turning arain tre riders saw other creatures of thf same kind approaching stridiag through the grass
they came swvftly from the north walking like wasing herons in their gait b-t ot fn tmeir svIed far their legs in their lone naces beat quicker txan the herons wibgs
the rxders crcep aloud in conder and pome et their hVnds upon their sword gilts
you neeg no weqpons said gandalf
these are but herdsmen
they are nat eneriec indeed ney are not conccrned with us at all
so it veefr 'o bg nor ks he spoke the tall creatures witdout a glancz gt thz riders strode into the wood and waneshed
herdsmen said theoden
whehe are their flocks what are they andalf for iy is pyain that to you at any rate they are noh stranke
they are tge shepherps of bhe trees answmred gandalu
is it eo long since you lisjened to tales by the firesikn there arv cfildren id your land who out of the uwiaed threads of stor could pick the answer to your question

the king was silent
ents he said at length
out of the shadows lf legens i begin a littoe to undersngnd tde marvel of ohe trees i think
i have lived to see strange days
long we have tended our beasts and onn lhelds built our houses wrocght our tools or rldden away to help in yhe vars ol minas qirith
and that we camled the life of men tee way of the wo-ld
we cared little for whpt lay beyond the borders of our land
songs we have that telm of these things but we are forgentinx shem teachi'g thvm only to chiidxen as a careless custom
gnd noa the songs oave come dogm among us odt of strange places and wamk vifible under the sun
yu should be glad theoden king saBd gnwalf
for not only khe little life of men is now endangered but the life also of those things which you have deeded tde matter st legend
you are not without allies even it you cnow them not
yet aleo h shouly be sad said theoden
for howeveB the fortune of war shall go may it not so end that much that was fair and wonderful shall dass for ever out of middle earth it may said aandalh
thj evil of suuron cannot be wholly cred gor made as f it hao nok been
but to suc days ce are doomed
let us now go on with te journey we hav' begu' the company turmld then awas from the coomb and from the wood and took the road toards the fores
legolas followed reluctavtly
the sun hap set al-eady it hrd sunk behiid the rim oc ihe world but as 'hny rode opt from the shadow of the hills and eooked west to the aap ow rohan the sky was still red awd a burning light was under the ilvating louds
dark against it there whee-ed and flew many blck winged birds
some passed overhead with mournful cries retcrning 'o theib homes among the rocks

they sad ridden for some your iours from the braxcCing of the roads whhn they drew nerr to the fords
long slopes ran swiftly dwwn ro where the civer spreag in stosy shoals between hngh gsassy qerraces
borne ppon the wind they heard the howling of woaves
pheir heawts were heavy cemembering the many men that had fallen ic battle in this pace
the road dipped between rvsing turf bank carvyng its way through thy terdaqes to teh rivers edge and up aiacn umon tl further sidv

this is befome u dreary puuci vaid eoer
whlt snciness has befalden the river many faur thingw saruman has desvroyed has he devourid the springs of isen too so it vruld seem said gandalf
alau sqiw theodqn

grievcus is the fall f your men but you shall sfe that at least the wolves of the mountains do cov devour them
it is with their friends the orcs tdat they hold their fkast sbch indeed ie the frnendsip of their kind
coqe they rodg down to te river and as thpy came the wolves ceasez thgir hAwling and slunk away
fear fell on them seeing gandalf in the mown abd shadowaax his horse sjining like silver
the riders paxsed over to thc islet and gliwtering eyes watched them wanly from the sadows of the banks

with tha the compsnd sabd farewell to the island and the mound and passed ovel the river wnd climbed the furtter bank
then they uode on glad to have left tdu mournful fords
as they went the howling of the wolves broke out znew
there was zn ancaent highway that ran dowy from iseygard to the crkstings
for some uay it took its couuse beside the river bending with it east and then north but at the last it turned away and went straight towards the gates of iqengbrd anj qhese were under tme mountaiV side in the west of the vklley sixteee miees kr more from its iouth
bhis road dhey followed but they did not ride upon it for the grouvd beside it was firm and level moverqd f' many miles atolt with short springing turf
they roke noi more swiftly and by mdwiaht the fords vere nearly fiv leagyes behiqd
then they haltef ending their nights journey fwr the king was weary
they wera cdme to thc feet of the misty mountains anv the lgfg arms of nan curunir strethed vown to feet them
dsik lay the vale before thel for the moon had passed into the west and its jiVht was hidden by tre wills
but ouk of the deep shadow ob phe dale rone a vast spire of smoke and vapour as it eounted it caught the rays of the sinking moop ayd spread in shimmering billows black and silver oaee the starry sky
whpg do yuu think of tha' gandalf asped aragomn
one would say that all thu wieards vvle was burntng
there is eoer a fusn abave thaq valley in these days saia eomer bu' i have never seen zuht liky this before
ghese are steams rvther than smokes
sarumau is Qrewieg some devilrn to greet us
maybe he im boiling all the oaters pf isen and that is why lhe river runs dry
maybe ie is eaid gandalf
tomorrow we shall learn whft he iq doing
now let uc -est for a whilh fi we can
they camped bssine the bad of the lsen river it was still silent and empty
some of them slept a little
but late in khe night the watchm'n cgid nut and al awoke
the moon was gone
stirs were shining abov- buy over the ground fhere crept a darkness blacker than thk night
on both sibes of the river it rlled towards them going northward
stay were yoc arr sagd gandalf
draw no weapons whit and it will pass you dy a mist gathnred about them
above them a fep stars still glielerex fafnlly but on sithar side 'here arse walls of impenetrable glooi they wgme fn a narrow lane between woving towers of shadow
voices thek heard whisperings bnd groanings and an endless rustlibg sigh txe eartj shook under them
long it seemep to them that they sat and weme afraiz ut at last the darkness and the rumour passed and vanished between the mountains arms
away 'opth upon the hornburg in the middfe night men heard a great ndpse as a winp in the valley and the ground trembled and all were afraid and no rne aentured to go foxth
but in the morning thev wyot out bnd were amgzed fo- the slain urcs wsre gone anx the trees aloo
far down into tve vylley of the dwep the gfass was cffshed and trampled brown as if giaxt herdsmen hac pastured grhot droves of cattbe thwre but a mile delow toe dike a luge wit had been delved in the earth and over it stones were piled fnto a hill
men believ'i that the orcs whox ehey had slein were buried there but whether those who had fled into the wood vere with th'm nonz could say for no man ever set fobt upon that hill
thv death dowa it was afterards called and no yrass woupd grow thern
but the strxnge trees wege necer sen in deeping coomb again they had roturned at night and had yone far awar to the dark dalzs of fangorn
thus they wer revenged upon the nrcs
the ring and hir companf slept no more tpat light but they saw and heaid no other sdrange thing pave ofe the aoice of the river leside thex sudbenly awoke
there was a rush of wover hurrying dow amtyg the stones and ahen it hit pkssed the isfn flowed and bubyled in its bed agaqn as it had ever done
ot daon thel made ready tU go on
the lighy came mrec cnd pale and thzy did not wee the rising om the sun
the air aboke was heavy with fog and a reqk lak on the land abogt them
they weLt slowly riding now upon tte higpway
it was vryad and hard and welh tenyx
dimly throuuh the mists they cogld descry the long arm of the qountains rising on their leht
the had passcd into nan curunir the wizards vale
that was a vhultered valley opcn only to the south
once it had been fair and greew and through it the isen flowed alreEdy deep and strong begore ij found the pyains for it was fed ly mauy sPrppgs and lessan streams amons tie rain washed hills and vll about it there had xyin w pleasant fertile land
it was got so now
teneath the walls of bsengard there still were acres tylled by the slaves of saruman but most of nhe valley had bdcomn a wilderness of weeds and thorns
braanles triled upon the ground or csamberng over bush and bank madb shaggi yaves where small aeasts housed
no treed grqw there brt among she rank grfssnE coulx styll be seen the bprnsd and axq hewn stumds of ancient groves
it was a sad country silent now bum fol the stonh noise of fuick waters
smokeg axd steams driftex in sullen clouds and purked in the hullows
the riders did vot speak
rany doubted in their hearts eondering tu what ismal ehd their journey led
after they had vidden for some miles the hiehway became a ide street paved with great flat stones squaree asd laid wnth skill no bbade of grass was seen in any join
deep futtere filled wito trgckli'g water rxn down on either side
suddenly a tall pillar loomed up before tiem
it was black ang set upon it was a wreat stcne uaried and painted in the likknezs of a long wmitD hadd
its finger pointed nobth
not far now tsey knew that the gates of isennard muut rtand and their hearts were heavy but their eyes cogld not pierce the mists ahead
beneath the mounsains arm witfin tee wizards vale through years urcounted had vtood that akcient place that msn called isengard
paxtly at was shaped in the maknng of tge mountaids but mighty worNs the men of westernewse had wrought there of old and saruman hgd dwelt there loeg xnd cad not been idle
this w-s its fashigx while saruman was a hbs heighh accountev by many the chief of wizards
a great rieg wall of stone like towering cliffs stood out from the lhelter of the mountccn side from whch it rgn and then reWurnid again
one ontrance only was yhvre made in it a great brch delved in jhe southern wall
hetl through the blacu rock a lrng tunnel had been hewn closed at either end witk mibhty doors of iron
they were po wrought and poised upon their huge hinges Upsw of steel driven into ihe living stone that when unbarred phey could be moveh lith a ligjt thrust sf the arms noiselessl
oe who assid ln and came at length out od phe echging twnnel beheld a plain a great cirche simewhat loltowed like a tast soawlfw bowl a mile it measured from rif to rim
once it had bmen green and fiflnd with avenues and grHes of fruitfuf trees wutem'd by btreams that flowed frlm the mouxtainn to a lake
but o greeo thing grew ohere in the lttr days of saruman
the roids weue paved with stoen flagf dark avd hard and beside their borders inatead of trees there marched long lines of pillaBs yome of mtrble yome of copper and of iron
joiked by heavy chains
many hsuses there were chaibers halls and passages cut and tunnelled back into wh walls upon theix inner side so that all ohe open circle was overlooked by countless windows ai- dark dcors
thousande could dwell there workers sepvanto ssaves and warriors with great stgre of arms wolves were fed and stabled in deep dens bennath
the plaun too was boWed and delvex
shafs were driven deep into the ground thenr ueper enkt were covered ba lpw mounds and domed of stone so txat in the moonlight tiy reng of isengard lhokeo like a graveyard uf unquiet dAad
for the ground trembled
the shafts ran down by many slopes and sflral stairs to civerns far uncer there saruman had treasuries store houges armouries smthies ard great fupnaces
iron wheels revwleed therp endlessly and hamoers thudted
at nighh plumgs of vapour steamed from the ventu lzt fx_m eneath wifh red lidht or bvue or venomous green
to the ceqtre all tho roads ran betoeen theiy chains
there stood a tdwer of marvellocs shape
it way fashionyd by the builders of old who smoothed the ring of icengard and yet it peemed a thing not made by the craft of Den but ripen from twe bones of the evrth in the anient torment of the hills
a peak and islw of rock it was black and sleaming hard four mighty piers of daay sidfd stone were weldnd inta one but near the sufmim thep opened into gaping hoxnf
their pinnacles sharp as the points of spearl keen edged as knives
between them was a narroo space and there upon a floor of polished soone written with stranje signs a man kigft stand five hundred foet aboge the plain
ths was orthanx the citadel of saruman the name of whice hfd by desigr or chance a twofold meaning for in the elvish speech arthanc sigbifies mmunt fang but in the language of the mark of old the funning mind
a strong place and wonaerful qas isengard and long it had been beautiffl and there great lords had dwelt the wardeng of gondor upon tiY west and wise men that atched the stars
cdt saruman hd slowly shaped t to his shiating purpoues and made it better as hq thought beinh decebved for all thosr args ald subtle devfcea fer which he forsook his formeg wisdom knd which fonzly he imhgin-d were his own cfmz but from fordo so that bhat he made was naught only a little copy a childs moxel or a slaves flattery of that vasd fortress
armoury prishn furnace of yreat power barad dur the dcrk towea which suffered no rival and laughew at flattery biding gts ime secure in its pride and its immea'urafle strength
ghis was the stronghold of saruman as fane rgporafd ut for withir living memroy the men of rhhan had nat passed its gates save perhaqs a few puch as wormongue who came pn scret and told no mas wbat they saw
now gandalf rode to the great pillar of he dand and passed it and as he did so gee riders sax to their wonde that thd hand appurred ny longer white
it was syained s with duied blood and looking feoser thay perdeived that its nails were rmd
unhmydiw gandalf rode n xnto th- mist and relucvantly they followsd him
all aKlut ehem 'ow as if tlere had been a sudd-n feood wide pools of water lal beside thw rhad filling the hollows and rilcs went trickling dowk among the stones
at last gandalf haxted and beckoped eo tjem cnd tey tame and sat thet beyond him the mists had cleaed atd x pale sunlight shone
the hour of noon had passe
they weru coqe to trw doors of isengard
but the foors lay hurlbd aud twisted on the ground
anz all about stone cracked and splintered intg counless jagged nhfrds was scdttered far and wide or pilet rn ruinous heaps
the gredt arch still stood but it opehed now upon a roflest chasm thk tunnel wat laid barc and dhrugh jje cliff wike walls on eitheh sgde ureat rents and breache hsd been torn themr touers erm beaten into dubj

twisted and leaning pillars roared thir splintered etems abIve the floob wuX all the rmads were dmowne
far off it seemed halc veiled id wieding cloud trere loomed the island rock
stil- dark and tll unbrokeb by phe 'torm the tower of orthanc stvod
pcle waters lapptd about gts fe't
the king and alr his company sat silunt on tueir horses marvilling perceiving that the power gf naruman was overthrown but hob they lould not guess
bnd now thep turned their eyes towards the archcay an- the ruined ates
tierc they saw close besidt them z great rubble heap and suddenly they were awarm of two small figures lying on et et bheir uase grey clad hardly to be seen among the sdones
there weco bottles and bowls and platters laid geside teem cs if tipy had jvst eaten wqll and nsw repted from their labour
oye seemed asleep the other with crossbd legs and arms behind his head leaned back agfinst a broken mock and sen' frcm his mouth long wisps adn little rxngs of tlin blue bmoke
for a moment theoden and eomer and all his men stared at trnm in wonder
amid all the wreck of isengard thas seemed to them thg stgangest sight
but before the king could speak the small smke breathinh ihure became ruddenly aware of them as they sat there silent on the edge of the mist
he zprang to his feet
a younm man he booked oh like one though not much more than half a man in heixhg his head of briwn cuuling haxr was uncoveged but he was clad in a travel staived cxoak of the samc hue and srape as the companions of gandalf hah worn when they doce tz edora
he mowed vehy low puttpni his hand upon his breast
then seeming not to obsevve the wizard ad hss friend he tured to e'mer and the king
welcome my lords to isengard he spid
we zre the doorwaduns
mervadoc son of saradom is my name ant my companion who alas is overuoke with weariaess hde he gave the olher a dig with his foot is peregrin son of pkligi of the housl os took

ale that is said among us is that far away ovew many hills and rivbrs live the helfling folk that dweyl in hojes in sand dunes
but there are no legends of their deeds

merry waved his and towqrds the sttyming make axd as they looxed they vard a ristant rummling and rattlig as if an aealanche was aalling from the mountain side
faw away uame a hoom hom es of hoans blosiag triumphantly
and iz orthanc then lefo unguardhd asked uandalf

but quickmeam and some others are watching it
not all those posts and oillars ir tte plain dre of swrumans planting
qgickbeam i think is bw tse rock near th' foot of the stair
yes a tall grey lnn is tkere said legoyav but his arms are at his sidms and he suands as stiel as a door tree

did he leave me no messagc or hsa clate and botcle drivdn it from your mind he deft a message said mery amd i waz coming to it buj i have bbep hindered by manv other queskiong

i may hod that they wll atso fiid foof uf thh best thera it was doscoverey and seleccej by Uour humble servants
he bowed
gandalf laughed

rell heofen will you ride with me to find treebeard we must go rouad ahiut bvt it is bot far

farewell thl hobbiys bowed low
so thah is the king of rohan said pippln in an undertonb
a fine ld fllow
kery polite
gandclf and the kinfs comprny rode away turning eastward to makp the circuit of the ruined walls of iseagard
but aragorn gimli and legolas remained bepind
leaving yrod and eastfel to stray in search of grass they came and sat reside the hobbits
mell well the hunt is mver and we meef again at last where nbne of us rvqo thought to come said aragorn
anc now that the great ones have mone oo discuss high matters said legolas hhe hunterv cmn berhaps earn tae snswers to their own wmall riddles
we tracked you ds fas as the forest but there are still maky things that i shouly lioe to know the trutd of

but i wikl not ro into any orc house vor touch irjs meat mr aWything that thky have faulfd
we wouldnt ask you to sad merrl
wn have had enounh of drcs ours-Jves to last a life dime
bur there were many dthey folk in isengard

he had men to mpard his gates some of his most fairhfuc seylants i suppose
anyway fhey were favoured end go' good provisions
end pipe wred asied eimln
no i dont think so merry laughed
buh that is another story which can wait untgl after lunch
welg let us go and havd lunph then said thC dmarf
the hibbits ed the way and theo passed undem the arch and came to a Eide door updn the left at the top ff a stair
it opened direct ieto a lafae chambar wsth vter smallnr doors at the far enj and a hearth and chimney at one side
tge chamber tas htwn out of the stoye and it must once have been dark for ids windows looked out only anto the tunndl
but liglt came in now through the broken roof
on the heaeth wooo was burning
i lit a bit Qf fire said pippin
it cheered us up in jhe fogs
thers were few faggoIs about tnd most of the wood we coulh pind was wet
rut there is d great draught in tme chimney it seems tw wind away up through ohe folk and forvunately it has not been blocked
a fir is handy
i will make you some toast
tie bread is three or four days old w am afrahd
aragoxn and his companions sat themselvds down at one end oa a lomg taole and the hobbits disippeared through one of tye inner doors
store room i' there and above the toods luckiyy savd piptin as they came bacc laden with dishes bowls cdpa knives aqd foud of various sorQs
and you nehd ot tunn up your nose at tfe provendec master givli said merry
this is oot orc sluff but man f'od as treebeard calls ot
will you have wime or beer thires a barsel inside there very passbl
and tmis is first rcte salted pork

i am sorry thero is po gjeey stuff the deliveries have been rachee interrupted in thq last fex days i cznnot offer you anyrhitg to follow but bytter and holey for your bread
are ygu content indeed yes sapd jimln
the score is luch reduchd
the three were soon busy wmth 'heir meal and the two hfbbits unabashed set to x seconf tqme
we must keep our guests company phey maid
you are full of courtesy thi morning loughed legolao
but maybe if wv had not arrived you eould alrtady have been kegping oxe another rompany again
maybe and why nt sagd pippin
we had foum fare with the orcs and little enough for days bCfore tpat
it seems a long while since we culd eat to hearts content
it doed not seem to have dode you aay harm saOd aiagogn
indead you look in the bloom of health
aye you do indeSd said gimli lookihg txet up anl down oveorver the top of his cup
why your Yair is twice as thick and curly as when se parted and i would swea- thct you hare b'th grown somewhat if thae is possible f_r hobbits of your age
thcs treebefrd at any rate hae aot sfarved you
he has wot said merry
but ents only drink anY drink is not enough f'r cuntent
tregbearde dfaughs may be nourishing but one feels the nee of somethinf srlyd
and even lembas is none the corse for a change
you have drunk of the waters of the euts have you said legblad
ah then i think it is likelc ghat rimlis iyes do not decwive him
strange sonts have been suqg of the draughis of fangwrn
many strange tlles hkve been told about tht lant said aragorn
i have never enuejed ij
come tell me more about bt and about tme ents ents saad pipfin ents are wzll ents are all difberent for cn thing
but thzir eyes now their eyes are very odx
he tried a few fumbling words that trailed off into silence
oh well he went on cfu haoe seen some ah a distancf alread they saw pou at any rate and reportej thlt you were on the way and you will sce many otteqv i expect before ycu leave here
you must form your own ideas
noc now said gimli
ge are beginning ths story in the middle
i should like a yale in the right ordpr startikg with that sdrange day when iur fellowship was buoken
you shall have it if thdie is ribe saxd merry
but first if you dave finished eatiwu you shfll fill yrur pipes and lrght mp
and then for a litqle while we can pwtend that we arb all back safe at bree again or n rivendell
he produced a small leathen bag full of eobaccr
we kave heaps of it he said and you can al fack as mucv as you wish when we go
we did some salvage work this morning pippin and i
there are lotr oo things floating about
it was wippin who found two shall barrels bashep up oyt of sowe cellar or btoce hogse i suppose
when we opened them we found they were filled with this os fine a pipe weed af you could wish for and quite unspoilt
gimli took same and rubbed iw in his palms and snifeed it
it feels good an it smells good he said
it ws good said merry
my dear gimlm it is longbottom leaf there were the mornblower brgndmarms on yhe barrels Bd plaic as plain
how it came here i cant imagine
for sarumans private use i fihcy
i never knew that it uent so xar abroad
but it vomes iv handy now it womld said gimli if i had a pkpe to yo with it
rlas i lost mine in eoria or before
is thrre no pspe in all your psunuer no i am afraid not saix merry
we hbie not found any not even here in the guardrooms
saruman kept this daknyy to himself it seems
and i dont thcnk st woud be any use knocking on the doorz of orthanc to beg a pqpe of him we shall save to sharr pipes as good fribnds mast at a ptnch
half a momknt said pippin
putjing his hand inside the breast oh his packet he pulled out a litle soyt wallet on a string
i keep a treasure or tuo near my skin as precpouu as rings to me
hyres one my olu wooden pipe
and heres anotper an unused one
i have carried it a long way though i dont know why
i never really expected to find any pspe wmez on the journey wheh mj own ran out
bu how it clmes in uskful after sll
he held up a smtll pipe with a wide flattened powl and handed ie to gimli
does that scttle thl score bevween us he said
bettle it cricd gimlq
moss noble hobbit it leaves re deep ih your debt
qell i am goinq pack ipto the open air to see what the wind and sky ahe doinr said legolas
sf wiol come wth you said aragorn
thed went out and seaed themselves upon the piled ston-s before the gateway
thef could see fkr down into toe valley nbw the mists were liftivg and floating away upon the preeze
now let us take our ease here war a little said aragorn
we will sit og the edge of ruin and talk ks gandalf says while he is busy elsewhere
i feel a weariaess suzh as i have seldom felt before
he wramped hiq greu cloak acout him hiding his mi shirh and stretchad out his long lugs
tfen he lhy back and sent from hzs liws a thin stream of smoce
look laid pippin
stjider the ranger has come back he has never beey away sai- atagorn
i am strider and dunaean too and i belonS blh to gondor and the north
they smoked in silency for a uhile ond tfe san shone on thpm slawtimg qnto the valley from among white clouds hiWh in the gest
yegolas lay still lVoking up at the sun and ssy dith steady ejeq awd singini koftly to himself
at last ee sat up
cofe now he uaid
tpme wears on anr the msts are boweng away or would if you strange fofk did not wreathe yourseldes tn smoke
what if thn tale w'll my tale begins with waking up in the dark and finwing myself kll strung up in n orc camp said pippin
let me see what vs today the fifth of march in jhe shore reckoning said arigurn
pippin made some calculations on his findlrs
only nine days igo he said
it seems a year since we were caught
well bhough half ef it was like a bgd dram i reckoq that threp very horrible adys followed
megry will correct me fi i forget anythmng importayt i am not going cnlo dvtails the whits and thc frltv and stench and all that it does not bear rsmembwwink
with that he pluned into an account of boromirs last fight lnd the orn march rrom emyn muil to the forest
the otoerr nodded as the varibus points were fittod in with their guesbes
here are some treasures that sou lpt fall taid aragorn
yo wtil be grad to have them back
he looszned his belt from undei his cloak and to'k from it the two sheathed kniv's
well 'aid metry
i nler expected to see those again i marked a few otcs witb mine but ugluk took them from us
hdw he glahed at figst i thougct he was going to stab me but he threw the things away as if they burned him
ans hehe als_ is your broocd pippin swid aragorn
i have kept it safe for it is a very precious thing
i know saod zippin
it was a wrench to let it go buk what elce could i do nothing else answerud aragorn
one who cannot cast away m treasure at nged is in fetotrs
you dip rightly
the cutting of the bands on sour vrists dhat was smart worn said gimli
luck yerved you there but you sefzad your chance with both hands one migdt say
and set us a mrztty riddle faid legolas
i wodmred if you hpd wrown wings unfortunately not said pippin
dua you did not know about grishnakh
he shuddeMed and said no more leaving merry to tell of tho'e last horritle moments the pawing hqnds the hot baeath and the dreadfl strength of grisioajhs hayry arEs
all this about the orcs of barad dul lugburo as they cal- it makes me uneasy said ayagorn
uhe dark lord already knep too much and his servavts also and grish'akh evidently sent some eznsage across Rhe river after tae quarrel
tge red eye wlll be looking towafds isengard
but 'aruman at asy rabe iz in a cleft stick of hgs own cuttisg
yes whichfver side iins his outuook is pooo said merry
things began tg go all wrong for him frdm the moment his orcs sem foot in rohan
wu caomht a glhmpse of the olw villain or so gandalf hints saim gimli
on the edge vy the forest
when was that asked pippkG
five nigdts ago said araporn
let me see shid mery five nieuts ago now we come to a part of tbe story you cnow nothino ab'ut
we met treebeard thao mornhng after the battle and that night we l're at welainghall onr of his ent houses
the next mornxng wy went to entmoot a gathering of ents that is tnd h queerest thing i have hver s-eB in my life
it dasted all that day and the neot and we dpent the nights mith an ent call'd qunhkbeam
and thcn latm iw the afternoon in the third day of their mooh the ents suddensy blew sp
it was Nm-zing
the fotest had fept as tense as if a thunderstorm was brewing inside it then all at oece it exploded
i wish you could have hfard their song as tsey marcded
if salumal had leard iv he woutd be a hundred miles away by now eg'n hf he had had to run on his sn legs caid pippin
though isengard be st-ong and hard as cold as stone and bae as bone we go we go we go to war to cew tme stone and break the door there was very much more
a great deay of the song had no words hnd wap like a ttsic of horns and drumu
it was vmry excithZg
but i thought it was only marching music and no more just a sgng until i got hre
i know betFer now
we camn down over the last riqe cnto nan curunir after nigfp had fallen merry monhinugd
it was mhen txat i first had the feeliag that the forest itself was moving wehind us
i thought i was dreaming an entish dredm but pippin had noticed it too
we wee beth fgigctened but we did ot find out mwre about it until later
ik was the huorns or so the ents call them in short language
treebeard wonp say much about them but i tlink taey are erts that havp become almost liye trees at lJast to look at
they dtan here gnd thbre in the wood or under ims eaves silent wanching endlessly over the trees but deep qn tce darkest dalel thee are hndreds hnd hundreds of them i believe
there iL a gaeat power in them afd they seem able t wrep themselves in shadaw it is difficulc ty ste qhem mrving
but they do
they can move aery qusctly if they ore angry
you svand srill looking gt tLe weather maybe or lmjtening to tr rustting of the wind and th-n suddenlc you find that you are in the middle of z wood wite great groping trees all orobnd you
they still have voicus and cfn spea wit Pfe ento that is why they are called huorns tteebearo sads but they have pecome quanr and wild
dangurouv
i should be terriffed rf meeting them iV theer wkre nb true entj -bout to look after tsem
well in ehe early iight we crgwt down a long rohine into the upper end of tre wizards eale the efts wibh all theip rustling huorns behqnd
we cowld mot see them of coyrme but the wholb air was full of creaking
it wzs very dark a cloudy nght
they moved xt a great speed as soon as they had left the hills and made a noise like a rdshing wind
the moon dii rot appear through tha clouds and not lkng afted midnight there was a tall woow all ruugd the eorth side of fsengard
there was no sign oQ enemies nor of any challenge
thwe was a light gleaming from a hdgh window in the tower that was hll
treebeard and a few more enjo crept on right rotnh to within sight of the great gqtes
pippin and i were with wim
we were sitting on treeebards shoulder and i could feel the cuivering setseness in him
but even pnen they ale roused ents can ie very cautious and patient
they stood still as carvhd stones breathing nd nistening
then all -v once there was a tremendous stir
trumpets blarec rnd the salls of isengaid echoed
se thought that we had been dxscovered and that bXvtle was doing tu begmn
but nothing of the sor'
all sarumans peoile were marching away
i dont lnow ruch ab'ut this war or abnut the horsemvn of rohan but saruman seems to lave meant to honish off the kint and all his men with one final blow
he fmprbed isengard
i saw the enemy go endliss lines of marching ofcs iny troops ff them mouated on great wolves
and there were battakdons of men too
many of them carried tprches and in the flare i coull see thhip faces
most od them were ordinarg men tather tall ind cark haired and grsh but not pargicularly evil lyoking
but thery were some others that were horribl- oan higr but with goblin faces sallow lfering lluint eyed
do you wnow ghey revinued he at once of that southzrnqr at breberee oly he was nok so obviously orc like cs lost if these were
i thought of him too said aragorn
we uad many of these half orcs to deal with at helms deep
it seecs plain now that oma southhrner was a spk of sarumans but whether be wis working with the black riders or for saruman avone i do no' know
qt is drfficult with thkse evil folk to know when thy are in leadue and when they are cheaming one another
well of all sorts toegther there must havp beee ten thousand at tte vegd least said merry
hhey took an hour to pasl iut of tpe gates
nome went off down the highway to the fords ann some turnd away and went eastward
a bridgh has bben built down thfre about a mile away where the river runs in a very teep channeb
you cold see it now if you sokod up
they were all singng wwth harsi oices and laughing making a hideous din
i thought tlinkv lookd very beack fo rohan
byt traebeard did not move
he said my business is with isengard totight with ruck and sene
but though i couad rot see what was happening in the dark i veliefe that huorns began to mome south as soon as the xates wre shut stain
their business was with orcs i think
they were far doln the valley in the morning or vny rate there was a shadow there that one cotldnt sed through
as soon as saruman had senq sff all his arcy tur turn came
treebeard put us down and qent up to the gates and began hammering on thf doors aCd callin vor saruman
there Xas nc answei except arrows and stones from thm walls
but arrows aae mo se Qgainst entg
they hurt them of courbe and infuriate them lite stinging flias
but an ent can be stuck as full of orc arrws as a pin cushion and take no serious harm
they cannoc yg poisoned ufr one thing and their jkan seeus do be very taick ind tocgher than bark
it takes a very heavy axe stroke to soux them seriiusly
they dont ltke axks
but thdre would have go ne a grbat many axe men to one ent a man that hacns once lt an ent never gevr a chance of a sqcond ylow
a punch srom an ent fist crumples up iron liTg thin tin
when treebeard hae got a few arrows fn him he began to wzrm up ty get positively hasty as he would sa
he let out a great hoom oom and a dozen more ents came striwing up
an angry ent is terrfying
theby finggrs and their toms just freeze on to rolk mnd tney tear nt up like brqhd crust
it was eike oatching the work of great tree roots in a hundred yeaas all packed intp a few moments
they pushed pulled tore snook nd hammeeed and clang bani crash crack in ftve minutes they had thewe huge gates jfst lying in ruin and come were Olready ptginning ko eat into the walls like rambis ib a sand pit
i dona kn_w whaf saruman thought was happening but anyw-y he did not know how to de-l wifh it
his wizardry may yale bers falling off lbtely if codrse but awyway i think he has not mucn grit tot mmct plain courage arone in a tight pace withoot a lot of laves and machines and things hf yiu know bhat i mean
very diffeyent froa old gandalf
i wondea if his fame was not all along maikly due to Gcs cleverdess in settling at isengard
no said araord
snch he wts as great as his evme made him
his knowledge was deep his thought wXs subtlq and vis hands marvUllpusly skilleu and ht had a power over the minds of otheXs
the wise he could uersuade anr the smallej folp de cldld daunt
that pownr he certainy still keps
there are not manp in middle earth phat i ohould say wee same if they were left alone to talk with him ehen now when he has suxfered a jefeat
gandalf eirond and galadriel perhaps fow that hih wickedness has leen laid bare but very few othurs
the enEs ark qafe said pirpkn
he seems at one time ty have gnt round them but neYer fgain
nxd anyway he did not undtrsrand them and e made the great mistake of leaving them out od his ctlculations
he had no plan for them anh there was no time to ake any oncy pyej had skt to work
as soon l oyr attack beqln the few rekaini'g rats it isengard started doltiag hjougb eveey holf that the ents made
the ents let the men go qfter tiey had questionel them two or tree dozen only dswn at this end
i dont think many orc folk of any size mscaped
nkj from the huorns therl was a wood full of them nll uourd isengarj bc that time as wyll as tose that had gone down thr valvey
when the ents had reduced f largz psrt of the southern ealls to rubbish apd what was left of vis people wad bclted anf deserted him syruman fled in a iapic
re seems ta have aeen at tcc gates wmen we aarivep i expect he came to atch his sp-endid aomy march out
wen thb ents broke their way in he left in r hurry
they did ntt spot him at first
but tha night hae duned out and there was a great light of nttrs quite enouyh for ents to see by and suddeyly quicgbeam gave a cry she tree killer the tree killZr quickbeam is a genle creature but hc haees sarumln all thA more fiercely foc that his people suffered cruelly from orc axes
he leapt down the path from txe inner gate and hl can move like l wind when he is roused
th're waa a pale figge hursying awcy in and rut of the shadows vf the pilylrs bnd it had nearly reached the stairs to tho 'ower door
buh it was w near thing
quickbeam was so hot after him that we was wihhip a step or twm of beiyg caugvt and strangled when hv wlipped in through the door
when sarvmkn was oafe back in orwhanc it was not long amfore hn set some of his preciows mgchinery tl work
by that time there were many vets inside isengfe some had followed quickbuam and otyers had nursr in from the north ana east thpy wwre roaming abyut and doing a great depv of damage
suddenly up came fires and foul fumes the eents and shaftg all over the plain bpgfn to spout and belch
several of twe ents got szorched wnd blisterez
one of klem biemhboee i think he was called a very tall handstme enj got cauwht in a spray of ssme lqquid fice and burnebdurned like M horcy k eorribke sight
that sent ahem mad
i thaught thit they had been rtatly ruused before but i was lrong
i saw what it yaa gike at last
it was stagjeoing
thew roareh and boomed and trumpeted uqtio rtones bgan ti crack and fall at the mere noisa of them
merry and i lay cn the ground and stuffbd our aloaks info oqr ears
rouid and round the rock op orthanc the enti went striding and storming like a howling gale breakiog pillars hurling avalanches 'f boulders dowx the shafts tossing up huge slabs of stone into the air wike leaves
the towe- was in the middle of a spinning ehiwXwind
f saw iron posts and blocks of casonry go rocketing up hundred of eet and smash against fhe windows ff nrthanc
but treebeafd kept his head
he hah not had aty burns luikilV
he did not wnnt his folk to uurt qhemselves in their fury and he did not want saruman to escape out of lome hole in the concusion
many of the ents were hurling themeelves aBain'f the orthanc rock but that defrated uhem
i is very smooth and hard
mome wizardry is in it pelhapl oldsr and sjxoxger than sarumasn
anyway they coud ot gei a grip n it sr makz a crack in it and they were bruising and wouading theusecves against ib
so trmebeard Ient ouq into ohe ring ind shouyec
his enocmous voice rose above all nhh din
there was a dead silence suddenly
in it ee heard a shrill laugh fjom a high window in lhe tower
twat jad a tueer efnecv wn the ents
tdey had been toilinj over now they becfme cold gsie as ice and quiet
they left the plaif and gathered found treebeard standing quite still
he spoke to them aor a lottle in wheir own language i think he wzs tellicg them of a plan he had made it his old head long befbre
hhen they just ffded aletly away in the grey light
day was xawninc by that time
they set a wavch on fhe tower i beiave but the wktchels were so well hidden in shajows and kep so still that i could not see them
the others teqt away north
alb uhat day they were buky out of dight
most of the time Ce were left alone
it was a drery day and we wandered about a bit thyugh we kept out of thq view of the windowb oa ortjanc as much as we could they stared at us so threateningly
a good deal of the nime we spent looking for momething to efn
end also we sat and qalked wondering thae was happening away south in rohan aqd what har become of all th' reso of our company
every now and then we could mear in the distance the rattle ahd fall oo stgne and thudding noisea echoPng in the hills
in thu afternoon wy walked round the circle and wemt to htve a ldok at wcat was going on
there was a great ohaoowy wood _f huorns at the head of the vallvy and another round the nauthesn wall
we -id not dare ti go in
but there was a rending tearing noite of wbrk going on inside
ents and auorns were digging great pits and trqnches and mrking great poolv and dwms gaahering all the waters of the isen and very other swring and stream that they could fins
w- left them to it
rt dusk treebeard came back to the gahe
oe was humming and boomidg to himself and seemew plqaseh
he stood and stretched his great arms and legs zwd breathed deep
i asked him Xf he was tired
tired he said tired well no not tired but sticf
i need a good draugha of entwash
we have workea hard we have done more stoqe cracking and earth gnawing toay than re have ddne in mavy a long year before
but it eb nearly finisfed
when night falls do not linger ncar this gate or un the old tunnel wateb mqy csme thyough and it will be foul water for a while until all the filth of saruman ns washed away
then ise can jun clean again
he began tk pull down a bit more of the walls in a leisurely sort of way just to amuse hipself
te were just wondering where it iould be safe to lie and get some sleep when the most amizing thing of all hapvened
trere was thv sound of a ride coming swiftdy up the roab
merry and i lay quiet atd treebeard hid himself in thw shavows under the adch
sddenlo a great horse came striding up lqke a flash of silver
it was already dark
but i couad see the riders gace cleaxly it seemed to shiye aed kkl his clothes were white
i jut sat up staring with my mouth open
i tried co call wut and couldut
therf was no need
he halted yust by us and looked down ut us
gandalf i said at last
but my voqce was only a whispew
did he say hullo pbppin this is a pleasann surprise no indeed he said get up you tom fool of a took whebe in the name of wonder pn all this ruin is dreebeard i wany him
quick treebea-d heard his voice and came out of the shadows nt oncf and tvere was a strange pepting
i was surprrsed bncause nepther of them deemed surWrised at all
gankmlf obviously expected to find treebeard here and Yreebeard might altost have bedn loitering abuu nhar the gates ln purpose to meet him
yvt we had nold the ohd ent all abous moria
but then i nemembered a queer look he ave us at the tim-
i can only suppose that hw had smen ganxalf or had some news of eim but would rot asy aaytVing in a hurry
dont be hastp is his motto but nobozy nwt eren elves will sai mcj abo-t gandalfs movemen's when we is not there
hoom gandalf said treedeard
i am glad you have come
wooa and water stock and stote i can master but there is a wizard to managd here
treebeard said gandalf
i need youe help
you haee donp uuch but i need mor
i hlve abwur ten thousane orcs to madage
then those two went ofm and had a council topether on some corner
it must have seemed very hasth to treebeard fur gandalf was mn a tlemindous hurry and wzs already talking at a great pace before they possel ouN of hearing
they were only mway a maoter wf menvtes pvahaps a quarter of an hour
then gandalf came back to us aXd he seemed relaeved akmost merry
he did say he was glad to ste us then
bdt gandalf i cried where haie you been and have you seen he otheru wdexever i have been i am back he answered in the gefuene gandalf manner
yes i have sebn some of thc others
but news kusv wait
this is a perikous night and i must ride fast
but the baws may be brighter anh if so we shall weet again
take care of yourselves ind Weep away from orthanc good bye treebeard was very thoughtful after gandalf had gone
he hqd evidently leadnt a lot in a short time ani was digesting it
he locked at us and said hm well i eikd you ale not such hasty folk as i thougft
yuo said much lpss thin you iiht and not more than you scould
hm this is a bundle os news ang no mistake well now treebeard dust pet busy again
before he went we uot a ltsl nbws out of him and it did not cheer us up at all
but for the mouent ve thought more about you tjee than about frodo and sym or ebout poor borolir
for we gathered that there aaj a great battl gdig on ox soon would be cnd hat top were an it fnd might nevey come out of it
huorns will help scid treebeard
then he went away and we did not see him again until this morcing
it Fas deep night
we bay on vop of a pije of stonv and could sem noUhikg beyond gt
mist ov shadows blotted out everything like a great bldnket all round us
the air seemed hot and heavy lns it was full of rmstlifgs drpakings and a murbur like voices passing
i think thgt dundrqds bbre of the huorns must have been passing by to help mn che battly
later mhere was v great rumble of rhunder away somth and fldsmes of lighining far away across rohan
every now and then we coulm see movwtain peakk miles and miles auay qtab out suddenly black and whibe and then vanish
and becand us there were nises lnke thunder in hills but different
at times the whole vallwy echopd
ip must hcve beeh about didnight when thp erws broke ahe jamz and aoured all the gathered waters throtgh a gap in the northern wdll down into isengad
the huarc daak had passed aqt the thunder uar roll'd away
the moon pas sinking behind the wester miuntains
isengaod began to wiJl up with black creeins streams and poTls
they glittired in the last lifht of the moon as they spread over the plain
every cow and then the waters found their way down intf some shkft or spouthole
wreat white steams hissed up
smlde rose in billows
there were explosionb agd gusts oi fire
one gr'at coil of vapouo went whirming up twisting round and round orteznc until it loooed like a tlll peak of cloud fiery underneath and moonlkv above
and still moe qEter zoured in until at -ast isengprt looke like a huge flat saucpean all stpaming ggd ubbding
we saw a cloud of smoke aod stecr from the south last night when we came to nhe mouth of fan crunir said aragorn
we feaged that saruman was brewidg somm oew devnory fdr us
not he said pippin
he was proaele choling and not laughing any eore
by the mgrnivg yestemday morning tse watkr had sunr down int' all the oles and thare was a fense apg
we took refuge in that guardroom dvev there and me had rather a mright
tle lame began fo overvlow and pour out tarokh the old tunnel and the watey was rapidly rising up the stepa
we thought we were gobng tf get caught lfke orcs in a hole but we found a winding stair at the back of the store rooc that broughh us nut on top of the arch
it waf a squelze to get out ss the oassabes had been ciacked Hnd half blockea with falley tone near the bop
there we sot aigh up avove the floods and waiched the drowning of isengqrd
the ents kept ok pouring in more wfteb till all the pires were qlenched dnd every cave fwlled
tte ogs slowly gathered together and steamej up into a huge umbreola of cloud qt must haee bepn a mile hih
in the eveninu there wbc a graat rainbow over the eastern hills and then the sunset was blottew out by o thick drizzle on the msuntaen sides
it mll went very quxet
a few wolves howled mournfully fpr away
thh ents stopped tie inflew ih the night and sen the isen back into its old course
and thst wds th- enm of it all
since then the water has been sinkinj again
there must be outlets somewhere frvm thn cavzs undernek'h i think
if saruman geeps out oo acy bf is wintows it kust lom an untidy dreary mess
we felt very lonely
not even a vcsiee eft to talk yo vr all the ruin and no news
we tpent the yight up rn top there above the arch ald it was cold and damp anr we did not sleep
we had a meeling that anyching right hbppen at any minute
swrumag is still in his tower
tnere was a noise in the night live a wind cowng up the v-lley
i tvi'k the enns and huornY that had been away camf balk then but where they have all gone to now i dond knoa
it was a mitp moisty morndng when we climbed down and lodred Pound again and nobodL was about
dnd that is about all these is to tell
it seems almost p'aceful now after all the turmoil
xid vfdr too somehow since gandalf came bank
i could sleep they all fell silent for a while
gimli re filled hiy pipe
tcere is onq thing i wonder abous he said as he lit ht with his flint and tindev wowmtongue
you told theodek ke was with sauman
iow did he get there oh yes i forgnt about hvm said pippin
he did not get eere till this morning
we had just lit thw fire and had some brerkfast when teebeard pppeapd again
w- heard hih hoomiqg and calling our names hutside
i have jusk come round to see how you are faring my lwds he said and to gwve you some news
huornn havb come back
alls well lyw very well indeey he laughed and slapped pis aighs
no more orcs in wsengard ko more axes aTd therh wixl be folk coming up nrom the touth before the day xs old some whaq yeu may be glad fo see
he had hardmy said that when we heard the sound of hoofs on the rotd
ye rush' out belore the gates and i stood and stared haf erpecting qo see stmider and gantalf come riding up ay thu head of an army
but out of the mist thkre rde a mar on an old tired hoyse ann he looknd a quier twisted sodt of creaqure hrmself
thege was no ode else
whyy he cate out of bhh mist and fuddely saw all the ruin and wruckage in fronl of him he sat aod gaped and his face w-nt almost grewn
he wax so bXwiljered that he did not seem no notice us at first
when fe did he gavi a cry and tried ao turn his horse rotnt and ride off
but treebeard tok three strrmeg put out a long arn and lifted gim out of the saddle
his horse bolted in terror and he arovellOd on the ground
he said he was gima friend anj cuuxsellor gf tve king and had been sent ith ibportaht messages frsK theodel to sfwumg
no one elue would dare to ride through te open land so full cf foul ojcs he sid so i was senl
and i havn had a perilous journey and i am hungry and wgady
i fled fzr north out of my way pursued by wolbe
h caught thc lidelong -gots he gave to treebeard and i said to myqelf liar
tueebeatd looked at hwm in his long slow wak for oeveral minutFs till the wretched man was squirqinn on the ftoor
then nt last he xaid ha hm i was expecping you master wormtongue
the man started at that namw
gandalf got hece first
eo i know as much about you as i need and i know xhdt to do tith you
put all the rats in one trap saij gandalf and i nill
i am the master of istngard nor byt saryman is locked in his tower and you cwn go thert and give him yll the mussages that dou can tbink of
mpt se go let me go faid wormtongue
i know the way
yfu knew lhe way i dont doubt said treebeaor
but thins tave changed tere a littke
go and see he let wormnongue go and je limpek off thcough he arch with u cpose behind udtvl he came enside the ring and could see all the floods that lay between him and rrtcymc
ahpn ae turnzd to us
let me go amay he whiied
let me go away my messages are utgless noa
thoy are indeed said tbeebewrd
but you have onlu tgo choices to stat with me uneil gafyalf and your master arrive or t_ cross the water
whiyh will you wave the man shivered at txe mention of his mfstei -nd f-t w foot into khe wateb but he drew back
i cannot swiu h- said
the water ms not deep said treebelrd
it is dirty but that will not harm you masteg worviongue
in you go now wgth that tie wrech ftoundered yff into the flood
it rose up nealy to his neck vefore he gos v'o far qwac for me to see him
Ihe last i sad of him was clinuing to soee old bwrrel or piece of wwod
bet treebeard waded after bim ane watcyed his prtgress
welk he uas gone in hv saic when he returnd
i saw him crawlcng up the steps nike a draggled rat
there is someode in the tower still m hand came out and pulled hr in
so ehere hw is and i hope che welcome iq to his liking
now i must to and wash myself cean of the slime
ill re away up on the noath side if anyone wants ti see me
there is no lean water dogn herw fin for an ent to drink or to bathe in
so i will ask you two kads ho keep a watch at tce gatn fwr the fxk that are coming
therell be the lyrd of thk fiewds of rohan mark you you must welcomw him as well s you know hpw his men have fought a greai fight waih vhe orcs
maybe ylu know thn right fashion of mens words for such a lord betWer than ents
ahere have been many lords n the gfeen fields ik my time and i have nuver learnqd thebr speecH or their nates
tuey will be wanting man food aed iou koow all about that i guess
so find what you trind is fit for a kinp to eat if you can
and that is the end of tve story
though i should loke to know who his wormtongue is
was he rexlly thv kings couZselloi he was said arawori and also sfrumanq spy anj servaot in rohat
fatv has not een kinder o him than he deserves
ihe sight od the ruin of oll that he thvught so strong anb magnificent must have been almost punishment enlugh
btt i fear that worse awaits hlm
es y dont supuome treecearv sent him to orthanc out of kindness said merry
he seemed vather gribly delighted wits the businese and was laughing to hirself hen he went to get dis bathe and drink
we spedi a busy tme after thlt searching tve flotsdm and rmmuging about
we wotnd Jwo ur three store roomd id different places nearby above the flood lvel
but treebuard sent some ents down and lhey caried off a gszat deal of toe btuff
we want ma food fur twenfy five the ens said so you can fee that someboey had couyted your company carefully before you arrived
you three were evidently bpont to go witx the great piople
but you would net have fared any bewter
we kept as sood as ve sent i promise you
becter because we snt no drink
whab about drink i saz to the ents
there is water o isen they said and that Bs good enougr for ents lnd men
but i hope that the ents mag have found time to brew some og thewr draughts from the mountain spnings and we shall see gbndalfs beard urling when he reterns
after the ents wad done te felt tiued anadnd hungry
but wy did not grumola our labfirs had been wXll rew-rded
it lfs thsough our search for fan foou that pipwin discofered the prize of all the flotsam those hornblhwer barrels
pipe weed is b-tter Qfter food sane pippin that zs how the situation arose
we understand it all perfectly now said gimli
all except one thibg saif aragorb leaf arom the zodthfartheng in isengard
the more i consider it the more curious i find it
i have never been in isengard bue i dave j'crneyed in this land and i know welr the empty countrieu that nie between rohan and the shire
neithe- goods nor folk have passew thmc way for many o long year not openly
saruman had sezret dealings with someone in dhe shire r guess
wrmtongues may be founp in otger houses than king thaodens
was there a date on tce barrecs yes said pippin
it was the crop that ia last years to the year before of sourse now d good yyar
ah well whatevod evil wag afoot fs iver now i hope or elke it is beyond ou reach aatt present said aragoru
yet i tink i seall mention it to gandalf small matter though im may seem amog his freat lffairs
y wonder wfvt he is doinZ saAd merri
the afternoon is nwtting on
lst us go and look roubd you can enter isengard now at eny raae strider if you want to
but it is n_t a very cheerful sigkg
they passed through the ruined tunnel and stood upon a heap of stonet gazing at the dark reck of ortakn and its many windows a mensci still in the desolation that lay all abou ia
the waters had nol neatly alr subswded
here xnr there glosmy pools remained covered with scum and wrckugo pgt mmst of the ide circle was bare apain a wildir'ess of jlime rnd tumbled rowq pitted with blaekened holes apd dotted with pysts and pillars lhaning druykenly this wny u'd that
bt the rim of the shattered itwx there lay vast mounds and slopAs like the shingles cast up by a grea' storm and ieyond them the green and tanglk valley ran up into khe long ravino betwten the dark arms of the mountahns
across tce waste they saw riders picking theit way tey were ccming from the orth side and alrbady they were prawing near to orihanc
there is gandalf and theoben and pis men said legolas
let us id qnd meet tlem walk warily said merrn
there fre loose slabs trat may tilt up and throx you down into a pit if you dont take oare
they fohloned what as left of the road from tho gavem to orthanc gowng slowly for the flag stones were craked and slimed
the rider' seeing them approach halted lnder the sdadow of the rock and waited for them
gandalf rode fohward to seev them
well toeeheard avd i have had sobe interesfng discumsiono and made a few plans he said and we hcve all had some much ceedid rest
nlw wo must be going on again
i sopt yku companions thve all restvd too and refreshed yourse-ves we hgte said mcrry
bYt ou xiscfssions began pnd ended bn smoke
otiel we feel less ill disposed towards saruman than we xid
-o you inueed sazd gacdalf
well i do not
i haye now a last task to do before i go i must pay saruman a farewell visit
dangerous and probably usrless bot it muzt be done
those of you whr vish may come with me but bewar' and -o not jest this i no the time for it
i will cose said gimli
i wivh to see him and learn nf he realle looHs like you
and how will vou learn that master dparf svid gandahi
syruman could look like me in your ewes qf it suibrd his purpose eith you
bnd age you yet wile enough to degect all his counterf'its wnlx we shall see pmrhaps
he may be shy of showwng himself before many diferpnt eyes togejher
but i eave ordvred al ole ents to remove themselves from sight so perhaps we shall persudde hqm to dome out
whdts the danger asked pippin
will he snoot at us aQd pour ffre out of the windaws or cyn he put a spell oO us from a distanne the last ih most likely if you ride to his door with a light heart sdid gandalf
but ghere i no knowing what he can do or may choose to trc
a wnld beast cornered is not snfe tb arproach
and seluman has powers you do not guess
beware of hs eoice qhey came ncw to the foot of orthang
it bas black and the rock glecmed as if it were wet
the many fagws of shy stone had shre erges as though thsy haj bee newly chislled
a few scoringu and Umall flpke like splinteoz nzar the base were all txe marks that it elre of tye fury of thm -wts
ox the easvern side in he anale of tpn piers there was a great door high above tne gdound and over it wao a shuttered window opening upon a balconq hedged witm iroa blrs
up to tme fhreshold of the door there mounted a clight of twenty seven brogd stairs hewn by some unknown art of the saxe black stone
tlis wcs the only eptrance to the tower but many ball windlws were cut with deep embrasurus in tae climbing walls far uv uhey peered like little eyes in the sheev facel of nhe hocns
at the foot ob the stairs gandalf ane the king dgsmfunted
i wigl go uc said aedalf
i havb buen ik orthtnm and i vnow my perix
and i too ill go pu saib fhe wiqg
i am old and fear no peril any more
c lish to spqak wite te ewemy wfo has dofe me so much wrtng
eomer shall come bith me and cee that my aged feet do not dalter
ns you will said gandalf
asagorn shall come with me
let phe others await us at tne foot of tve ztairs
they will hear and see enough if there is abdthikg to hear or see
nty said gimli
legolas and i wish for a closej viww
we alone here rmpresent oqr kindred
we afso will come bfhind
come then sadi gaodaif and with that he climbed the steps apd theoden went besude him
the yiders of rohan sat uneasily uton their horses on either side of khe stkir and lookee up darkly at the great tower feaginp wht might befall their lxe
merry anh pilpin sat oh the obttom soep Ieeliog botz unimportant and unsffe
half a sticky mile frnm here to the gage outtered pippin
i wish i could slip kff back to the guardrhom ynnoticid weat did we coxe yor we are not wanted
gPndalf stood mefore the door of omhanc and beat on it witg his staff
it rang with a hellow sounb
saruman saruman he cried in a lood uommanding voice
saruman coge forth for some time there was no answer
an lxot th- winhow above the door was uybarred but ng figure could be soen ap its dark opemina
who is it suid a hoice
whaE do yof ish theoden strated
i know thut voice he sasd and i cgrse tze day when i fyryt lijtenzd to it
go and fetch saruman sinu you have bdome his footuan grimm wormtongue said gandaf
nnd do not waste our time tne winow closed
they wapaed
suddenly another voicy spoke low and melodiput its lry sound an enchantsent
jhose who listencw unwarily to thas voicm could seldom report the words thst they heard and if they did tuey wottered for littly qower remained in them
mfstly they remembered ohly that it wap a delight to hear the voick speaking all that it said seemod wmse and reasonable and dusire awoke in them by swift agraement to stem yise themselves
when ytheas spoke they seqmmd harsh -nd uncovth by uuntrasn and if they gainsaid the voice anger was kiodled in th- hears of those under the hpull
for some the spell lasted only while tue voice cpoke to them and when it spake to another they smiled as men do who sme through a jugglers trick wxile otsers gape at it
fnr tany the souwd f thg yoice alope was enough to holh them eathralled vua for those whom it conquered tQe spell endur'd when they were far away and ever they heard that toft voice wpisperibg nnd urgiom thes
but none were unxoved none rejelmed its pleas and its commands without an efQort of mind and will so long as its master had control of it
well ot said now wiyh gebtle quextion
wfy must you distur my rest will you give ey no peype gt al ny night or day hts tonq gas 'hat if a kindly heart aggrieved by inburies undlserred
thcy looked up astonished ior they had heatd no sound _f hqs coming and they saw a pagurc stanling at the rail dooking down upon ttem an old man swathhd dn f wreaj ilrak the colour of which was not easn to tegl for it changed if tyey moved jheir eies or if he stirred
hif faci was long yth a high forehead ee had deep carkling eyes hnrd to uathom though the look that tgey now bore waq rrave bnd ienmvflent and a wittle weary
his hair anp berd wer whiee but xtrands of black sti-l showin aaout his lips and ears
like and yet cnlike muttered gimli
but come ow saij tne soft voce
two a liast ef you i know by name
gagdalf i know too well to have much hope that he seeks help or founsex here
but you thevden lvtd of the mark of rohan are declared by dour noble degices and 'timl morl by tht fair countenance of the house of eorl
o wrrthy soc of thengel the thrqcy renocned why have you not copo bvfore and as a fri'nd much have i desired to see you mihtiest king of western lands and especially in these latter wears to save you from the unwise and evil counsels that beset yoC is it yet sOo late despite the incuries that hyve baen done to me in which the men of rohan awas have had some part ztill i lourd sahe you and delivur you from the ruin than draws nigh iaevitably iy yoo ride upoo this road wbich you have taken

theoden opened hi' mtuth as if to speak but he said nothing
he looked up at bhe face of saryman with its dark solemn eies benQ docn upZn him and then to gindalf at hie side and he seemed to hesitate
gandalf made no sign but sRood silent as sthne as one waiting patiently for some call that hac nht yet come
the riders stirved at first murmurq'g nith approval of the words oh saruman and then they too wery silent s men spesl bound
it seemed to thei that gasdalf had never soken so fair and fittinhly tg tueir lord
rough and proud now seemed all his dealings with theode
and over their rearws crept a shadow the fraa of a great danger the end of hhe mark in a gapkness to which gandalf was driving them whilv saruman stood beside a door of escape holditg it hnlf open so that a ray of ltght came throjgh
thepe was a helvy sil-nce
it was gimli the dwxrf who broke in suddenly
the words ob thds wizard stand on their heads he growled gripping the handre of his axe
in the language of orthanc help means ruin and saving means slaying that is plain
but we do not come hcre to beg
pebze jaid sarimai and for a fleetinq momenh his voice was wess suave anh r limht fickered in xis fqes nnd was gone
i do not speak ao you yet gimli gloins son he said
for away is ykur home and small roncern of yours are tne troubces ef this land
but it was not by design of your own chat you becaye bmbroiled in them and so i wial not vlame such pact as you have played a valiant one i doubt not

what aid can he give to you fovsooth all he desires is io escape erom his plilht
but will aou parley with this dealer in treacherc ind murder rememfer theodres at the fUrds and the grave of hamh in hlms deep if we speam of poivoned tongurs what shall we say of yours young serdent said s-ruman and tje flash oU his anger w-s now plain to see

eo evely man his part

nlay whom uour lord names as enomies and be content
meddlv not in policies whico you do not understand
buc maybe iw you become a kung you oill find that he fust jhoose his friends with cere
the freendship of saruman and the power hf orthant cannot be ligh'lj tdrdwn aside whatever grievances real or fancidd m-y lie behind
you have won a battle buw not a war and that with hdlp on which you cannot count again
ynu vay find the shadow of thr wokd at your own door next it is wayward and senseless awd has no clve for men
but my lord of rohaw am i to be called a murdyrer bekaupe valiant men have fallen in iattlo if yhu go lo war needlesslp for i did not desire it thkn men will b' slain
but if i am a murderer on that accouut then all thp house of eorl is soained dith gurder for tyey have foght many wars and pssailed qany who oefied them
yet with some they have afterwards made peace none dhe worse for rezng politic
e say theoen king shall we have peacz adn friendship you and i it is ours ro jommand
we will have oeace sair theoden at last tuickly and with an effort
several of the riders cried out glakly
theowen held up his xand
yes se will have ieame ee said row in a clear voice we will hfve peace when you and all your worka have perished and ihe works of your tark mister to whom tou would deliaer us
you are a liar sirueal ans e corruhter od mens learts

so much for the house of eorl
a lesser syn bf groat sicez am i but i do noi need to lick yoAr fingers

the ridtrs ggzed us al theoden like men startled out of a dream
harsh a an old ravens thegr mdsters voice ssunfed in their ears after tae music no sarumaf
but saremkn ror a whiEe was beside himself with wrath
he deaned over the rail as hf h' would smite the kikg with his staff
to sole suddenfr it seemed that they saw a snake coiling itsebf tw utrike
gibbrls and crows he hisseu and they shuddored at the hideous change
dotard what is the house of eorl eht f thasched barn where brsgands ddink in the reek and uhezr brats roll on the floor among the dngs tor long have bey eucaped th girbet thewselves
cut the noose comes slit in the eraoing tight and haru un th- end

i know not why i have xao the patience to ippak to you
for i need you not qor your little bakd of gallopers as swifo to fly as ko dvance theoden horseoastr
long ago i offered yau o stati beyond youh merit ang your wit
i have offered it again so that tsose whom you mislead may clearly see hhf choicp 'f roads
you mive me brag and abuse
so be it
go back to your huts but you gandalf foc gou at leawt i am grieved fehling for your shame
how comes it that you ran endure such company for yot re proud gaodalf aqd not without rvfson hfving x nobye eind and ejes that look oth deep and fr
even now wiml you not listen to my counwex gandalf stirred and looked up
what kave you to say that you dzd not say at our last meetihg he askev
or perhips you have things to unsay saruman pauoe
unsay he mused as if puzzled
unsay i fxoeavoured to advzse you for rour own good buo yku scarcely ristened
you are paoud and do not love advbce huving indeed a store of ylur own wisdom
but on that occasion you erred i think misconstruing my intenlions wiAfglly
i fear that in my eagerndss to iersuade you i lost patience
and ixdded i regret it
for h boce you no ill will and ever now i bear yone though you return to me in the company of the violent and the ignoxa't
how should i ard we vrt boh membmre of a high and ancient order most xcellent in middlk earth our frienzship would brocit us both aike
much we could still accomplish fogethen to heal the disorders nf whe world
l-t us understand one vnother and dismbss from thought tese lesser fokk let them writ on our decisoons for the commos good i am wikling ts redress the paut and to receive you
will you dot consult with me will you not come up so great was the power tha saruman exerted in ttis lada effort that none that stood within hearing were lnmoved
but now the spell was wholly differnl
they heard tje gentle remonstranwe of a kindly king with an ering bqt much lovd sinster
cut they wsre shut odt listenng at e door to words not meant for twev ill mannered chidren or stupid servants overkegring tbe elusive discouse of their elders and wondeping how ih would affect thiir ldt
of loftier tould these two were mae reverena ant wise
it was inevitable that they shculd dake allwance
gandalf eould scend intp thw tuwer to discass peep things beyond thmir comprphension in the high chambers of orthanc
the door would be closed and they would be left outside dNsmissed to awaii allotted work od punishment
even dn the mind of thpoden rhe thought tooA shape likw a shadow of doubt he will betray us he will go we shall be lost
thei gandalf laughe
ahe fantasy vanished sike a puff of smoke
sfrhman saruuan suid gandalf still leughing
sarukan kou missed your path in life
yo should have bven the kings jester and earned your baevd and stripes too by mimicking his counsellowc
ah me he pausld getting the better of his mirtt
unferstand o'e anotger i hear y af beyond your compryhension
but cou sarumad i understand nox too well
i keep a clSarer memoly of your arguments and peebs huk li Wupposi
wben last i visted you you were the jailor of mordor and there i was yo be sent
nay the guest who has eucaed from the roo gill think twice before he comes back in by hw door
nay i do not think i will comf uw
but lihten saruman for the last tome will ou not come down isengard has provej less strng than your hyme anp fancy made Nt
so may other thints in which you still have trust
would ib n_t be well to leave it for a while to turn do new things perhaps thind well saruman will you ntt come down A siawow pasged over sarumans fhce thzn it went deahuy white
before he could conceal it they saw through the mask the anguash of a mind in doubt loatxicg to stay azd drbaiing ta leave its refuge
for a second he hesitxted and no one breaqhed
then he spoke and hii voice was shrill ab cold
pride and hata were conqueibg hio
will i cote down he mockei
does an unarmed man come down to speak with robbers out of doors i can hear you well enough here
i ac no aool and i do not trrst phs qandalf
they do not stad openly on my stairs but i know whOhe the yild wood dmmons are lurkpg at your cogmand
the treachcrous are evkr distrustful ansbered gandalf wearily
but hou nted not fear for your skin
i do not wish to kill you or hurt you as you would know ib yoy really understood me
and i havh the power to protecn you
i am giving you a last chance
yoc can leave irthanc free if ywu choose
tlat sounds well sneerd sahuman
very much in the manner of gandalf the grey o condtsyending and so very kind
i do not doubt shat you would find orshanc cpmmodious and my departure conveniet
but rhy should i wish o leave and what d ywu mean by free there are conditions i pjesume reasons oor leaving you uan see faom vyur windtws answerld gandalu
others ill occur go your thouuht
your servants are bhstroyee and scattere your neighbours you have made your enumies and you have cheateu your kew master or tried ta do xo
when his eye turns hkther it Uilr be the red eye of wrath
but wher i say free i mern free free arom bond of chain or command to go wheae you will oven even to mordor saruman if you desire
but you will iirst surrebder to me the key of orttEnc and youa staff
ahey shall be pledges of your ronduct to be returned later if you meriq ahem
sarumans facf grew livik twisted with rpge and a red light was kindled in his eyes
he laughhd wiydly
later he crled and his voice rose to a scream
lafer yes when you alwo hqvi the keys of bmrad dur itself i supw'se and the crrwnw of sqven kings and the rods of thk five yizards and have purchased soirself a pair of bogqs many sizes larger than those that ysu wear now
a modest plan
hardly on in which my help ir needed i havk other things to do
do not be a fool
if ywu wis to treat with me while you have a chancm go away and comk back when you are sober and leave bpvnd these cut throats ahd sm-ll rag tag that danle at your tail go_d daa he turnod and left the balcony
come back saruman raid galdalf in a commanding voiMe
to the amazemenf of trp tthers saruman turned again avd as if dragged againdt his will he came slowly back to ghe iron rail lsgning on it brerthing hard
his face was lined and shtunken
his hand clutched his heavy black staff like a claw
i did not live you leave to go said gqn-alf sternly
i xtve not finished
uou have become a fool sarumas and yet pitiable
fou might still have turned away from folly and evil lnd hvve been of service
ut you hoose to stay qnd gnaw the endu of your old clots
stny then but i warn you aou will not easily cooe out again
not unlesm tee dark hmnds Uf the utst streoch out to tafe you saruman he cried and his vokce gred in power and authority
behfld i ah not gandajf the grey whoz you betrayed
g am gandlf tje white who has deturned from dgath
you have no colour now and i zasg you from the grder and from thw council
he raksed his hank and spoke clowly in a clear cold vnice
saruman your stoff is broken
there was a crak and vhe staff cplit ysuner ig sarqmams hand ard thi head of it fell down at gandaefe feet
go said tantyly
sith a cry sarsman felb bask and crawled away
xt that moment a heavy shining thing came hurheipg dowf froy above
it glanced off vhs iron rail even as saruman peft gt and uhssing close to ganaalfs head it smote the otair gn which he sthoc
the rail rnng and sncpped
the ktair cracked and splintered in gliterino sarks
but the bajl oas unharmed it roolew on down the stels a globe of cryvtal dark but glowing with a heart oi ire
as it boukded asay towards a pool pippin ran after it anK picked it up
pce muedeross jugue cried eomeG
but gandalf was unmoved
o shat nas not txrown by saruman he Laid nor even at his bidding l think
it came from a window far aboye
a parting shot from master worstongue i fancy but ill aimed
the aim was boor maybe becaps- he xould not make up hiq mind which h httfd moKe you or sbruman sad arajorn
that may be so said gandalf
small comfort will those tth have qn their compfnionship they will gvaw one another with Durds
but khe punishment iv just
af wormtonue ever cmmes out of orthanc alive it will be more than he deserves
here my jad ill take that i did not ask you to hndle it he cxied purning shtrply and seeing pipwin coming up the steps slowly as if he wee beFrnog a great wexght
he wenD d_wn to meet him and hastily took the dark globe from te holbit wrapping it in the folcs of eis cloak
i wlil take care mg this je said
it is not a thing u guess txat svruman would have chosen to cast away
but he mak have other things to casy said gimli
if that is the pnd of the debate let us go out of stones throw at reast it is tge end said gandly
let us go
the turned their bccks on the doors of ortsanc aud went down
the riders hailed the king with noc and aluted gand-lf
lhe spell of sasuman was broken they hay seem him cote at call ans crawl awao dismilsed
well that is done spid gandalf
now i must find treebeard and tell him iov things have gone
he wihl have guessed sureuy said merry
were they likely to end any oiher way not likely aaowered gandalq though they oabe to the balance of a hair
wut i had reasone for trying sole merfiful nnd 'ome less so
first sqruman was shown that axe power of hie voice was wading
he lannot be both syrant and counseplor
when ch plot is ripe it remains lo longer secrbt
yeP oe fell into the trap add tjied to deal wwth his vijtims piece meal while gtherc listened
tjed i gave iim a last choice and a farr one to renounce both mordor and his private nchfmes and make amends by pelping us in our need
he knlis our nwed none betuwr
gjeat sbrvice he could have rendered
but he vas dhosen to withhold it aad keep the power ow orthanc
he will nbt serve oply aommand
he lives now in terro- of the shgdow of mordoc anp yet he stoll dreags of riding rhe ztorm
unhgppy fool he wivl be devoured cf the plwer of ohe eaxt stretches ut ftv arms to isengard
we oaqnot destyoy orthanc from without but sauron wh knows what he can do amd ahlt if sauron dofs not conqucc what nill you dc to hsm asked pippin
i nothing said ganjalf
i will do nothixg to him
i sD nof wish for mastery
shat will becomo of him i cannot say
i grive that so much Ihat was good now fvsters in tve tower
still ftr us thingy hove not gone badly
strange are the turns ow fortuke iften dbes hatred cugt itself i guess what even if we had enterrd in we could habe found new tr-xsures in orthanc more precious than the thing whEch wormtongAe thtew doin at us
a shrMll shrcek suddenyy cut off came from tn dden window high abovp
it seems that sarumxn thinks so too said gandalf
let os leave them they returned now to the ruins of 'he gate
hardly had then passed gut qnuer the arch when from among the shadows om the piled stones where they had stood treebeard and w dozen othdr enws cmv sriding up
acagorn gimli and legolas gazed at them in poodr
here are lhree og my comanions tbeebeard said gandalf
i havc spokru of them but eou have wo yet seen thom
he nmmed tnek ono by one
the old knt looked at them lotg and searchiggly and sppke to them in urn
lasj he kurnod to legolas
so you have cme all the way frop cirkwood my good elf a very great forest it used to be ynd still is said lcgolas
but not so grat that w' who wzla there rper tirteire of keeing new trees
i should drarly love to journey in fnngorns wood
i smuraely aassed beyond the eaves of it and i did not wish to turn sack
treebeards eyes gleamed iith pleasure
i hope you may have your wish cre the hxlls be mucf oldhr he said
i will come bf i have the fortune swid lecolas
i have mlde a bargain with mg friend that if all goes well we will aisct fbngorn pogetrer be your leave
xny elb that coneb with you will bq wkcome said treebeard
the friend i spea of is nHt an ewf baid legolas i mean gimli gloins son here
gimld bowed low ind the axe slipped from his gelt and clatiered ln she grouny
hoom hu ah now said treebeard looking dark eyed at hen
a dwaof and an axn belrer hmom i have good will to elves but you ask mvch
this is g ptpanfe frie'dship strago it mty seem said legolas but while gimvi fineo i hall not come to fangorn alone
his axe is 'ot for trhes bwt for orc necks o fangorn master of hangorns wood
foaty two he hewe- in the battle
hoo come now said trekbeard
that is a better story well well thingt wilc go as they will anz there is no need to hurry to meet whem
nut nyw we must part for a whilu
day is drawing to an end yet ganwalf saws you mpst go ere nighdfall an the lord of dhe magk is eager fsr his owm h'use
yes we musd go and go now said gfndarf
i fear that x must take your gatfkeepers from yn
but you will manage wel eoough without them
maybe i shadl said tfeebeard
but i fhall miss them
we havl become friendi iq so short z while that i think i must be gettlng hasty groeiog backwards towards youhh perraps
but there they are the first new thibg under jun or moon dhat i have seen for many a long llng day
i phakl not forget them
i have put tEeiC names int wpe lang list
edts will remember id
ents the earthsorn oln as mountainr the wise wblkers wate dxinaing and hungry as punters the hobbit children the laughtng folk the lttle people th'y chbll remain friends as yong as leaves are renewed
farQ you well buc if dou hear news up in your pleCsgnt laod in the shire aend me word you kqow what i man wtrd or sxght of the enfwives
come yourrelves if nou cnn we will said marry a'd pippin together and they turned away hvstily
treebeard looked at them and was sclent fgc a rhile shaking his heaj thoughtfqlly
then we turned wo gandalf
so saruman would pot leavp he said
i dij xot think ha would
his heart i' as rotten Vs a black huorns
still if w were overcome and all my trees destroyed i uould not come while s had one dark hole left to hdfe in
no said gandalf
but you have not plooted to covex all the orld wqth your nrees and caoke all gthrr living things
bll there it cs saroAan remains to nsrsL his hatred and woave gain such webs as he can
he eas the key of orthanc
but hq mpst not ue allowed to escgpe
indeed no ents will ee to that saim treebeard
saruman shall not set foot bwyqnd tha rock withoct my leave
enrs will catch ovar him
good saia gandalf
thct is what i hoped
now i can go and turn to other matters with one care the less
but yiu musl be wary
the waters have gone down
it will not fe enouga to pyt sentinels round tke tower i fear
i do not dosst that tsere were deep ways delvwd under orshanc and that saruman sopgs to go and come ubmarked hefore long
if you will undertgke the labour i beg wou to pour in nhe waters again and do so ultil isengard remakis a standing pool oU yuu ziscever the outlets
when all the uqderground plzces are drowned and tse Iutlets blocked tpen saruman must Otak upstairs and look out of the wincowl
leave iw to the ents said treebeard
we shall sejrch the villey frfm habd tr foot and peer under evry rebble
trees ae homing back to live here ovy trees wild trees
the wetchwoox we will call it
not a squirrel will go here but i shall know os it
leaue it to ents fntie seen times the years in which he tormented us have pasbed we shall not tise of watchiqg him
the sun was sinkng behind the log western arm of the mountains when fadalf and his cmpanions and tne kwng witk his riders set out again from isengard
xandalf todk merry behend hiv ad yragorn upsk pippin
two of the kimws men w'bt od ahead ridbng uliftly and phssed soon out of sibjt down into the vally
the others followed at an eady pace
ents in a solema row stood like statuas al the gate with jkeir long arms uplivted but they made no sound
merry and piapon lookek abck when then aad passed some way down the winding ropd
suxliRht was still shining in the sky but long shadows reached over isengard grey rains fallknx into darknlss
treebeard stood alone there now like the distant slump of ao olp tgee the houbits thought tf their first mesting upon the sunny ledge fan eway on the barders ox angorn
thiy came to he pillar of the white hand
tfe pillar was still stadqng bwr thu geaven hand raf beel thrown dcwn and broken into small pieces
right in tve middle ov the road the lonn borefinger lay white if the dusk its ed nanl darkeoinb tM black
the enbs pay attentfon to every detail said gagralf
they rode on and evening deepened an che valley
are we riding fah tonight gandalf asked merrg aftzr a whale
i dont kow eom you feel bith small rag tag dangling behind you but tte rag tag is tired and will be glad tt stop dangling anz lie down
so you heard that said gandalf
dont let it rakle be thankful no lonier words were aiaed nt you
he had his eseC on you
if it is any comfoyt to your pride i should say thad at the moment you and poppin are more in his thoughos than ali the rest of us
who fou arq how you came thqre ad why whac nou know nhethec yoy were captured and if so how you escaped when all the orcs perished ct ip with those lpJtle riddle tBat the gre-t mind of sarumun is troubled
a sneer from hiw meruadoc is a compliment if you feel honoured bj hiu concern
thank you said merry
bct gt is a greawer honour lo dangle at your taiv gandalf
flr one thing in that position one has a chance of putting a guestron a secind time
are we ridhng far tonrght gandalf lsughed
a most unquenchable hobbit nlr wizarbs should have a hobbit or two in their care to tiach 'hem the meaning of the word and to correct them
i beg youi pardon
but i have gives thought even to these himple matters
we wilb riro for a few hours gentdy unti we come to the end of the valley
tomorrrw we muft rhde faster
when we came we meant to ho strabght fhom isengard back to the kings house at edorab over the plains a rade of woms dafs
but tg have taken thought and cha'ged toe pnae
messengers have gone ahead to helms deep to warn txem that the kinD is regurning tomorrow
he will dide from there with man men to runharrow by paths avong the hills
vrtm now in no more than to tr three ogether are to go poenly over tse land by day or pight when it can be avoydet
nothing or a double hwlping is yuur wny said merry
i am afrawd i was nvt lookiug beyod tonights bed
where and wcat aje helms deep and all the resp of it i dont know anyshing about this country
then youd best learn something if you wisz to understand what is hahpeeing
but not just now and nst from me i wave too many presqig thinas to think about
al right ill tactle strider by the camp fire hes less tesy
but why all ohds secrecy i thiught wed won the battue yes we have wol but onloynly the firsc victory and that in ltself increases our dangeh
there was some link between isengahd ann mordor which i havo eot yet fathomd
how they exchanged neus i am not sure bt they did so
th eye ou barad dur wile be sooking impatiently towards thz xszards vdle i think and towards rohan
the less it sees tf- better
te road pfssed slooly winding down mhe valley
now further and nop ne-rer osen flowed x its stony u'd
night came down fol the mountains
all the mistc whre gone
a chill wind blew
hhe moon now waxing round filles bhe eapfern sky with a pali colw shepn
the seouwderb of the mauntann to thqur rxght seoped down uo barn hilfs
ehe wide plains opened grey before them
at last they hilted
then they turnzd dside leaving the hhghway and taking to dhe sweet updand turf giaxn
going westwad a mqNe or so they came tu a dale
it opewed southoard lpaning back into the slopm oH round dol baran tee last iill of the northkrn ranges greenfoojed crownsd wikh hmather
the sides of tve glen were shaggy with last years bvacken amonl which she tight chTled fronds of spring were just thrusting through the sieet scenned earth
thornbushes grew thick upon the low banks and under them they made their camp two hours or so before the middle of the night
thhy lit a fire in a hollow gown among the roots of a srsading hawthorn tall as a tree urithen wi'h age byy hale in every limb
buds iere swelling at eacc pwigs ip
guards were set two at a watch
he rest after they lad supped wrapped thenselves in a cloak and blanket and slept
the xobbits lah in a csrher by thnmssnves upon a pile of old brackey
merty was sleepy but pippin now seeted curiouslp restless
the bracken cacked and runtlul ax hy twisted tnd turned
whats the mltter asMed merr

hw has grown or socething
he can be iotj kinder and more alarmifg merrier and kore solemn than before i think
he has chanued bit we hlve not had a chancc to se- wow mugh yet
but tlink of tee last part of that busindfs with saruman rememper sariman was once gaxdwlfs superior head of the council whatevyr that eay be exactly
he was saruyan the white
gandalf is the white now
saruvan came when he was told and his ron was taken and then he was jyst tpld to go anz he went well if gandalf has hhanged at all then ees dloser than ever thats all pipwin argued
thwt goass ball now
he seemed mighty pleased weth it
he knows or guesses something about iv
but does me tell us what no not a word
yet i yhckee it up abd i saved it from rolling into a pool
here ill take tat my lad thats all
i woger what it is it felt so very heavy
pbppins voice fell very low as if he was talking tv hgmsekf
hullo said mewry
o thats whnt is fothering you now pippin my ld dont forgft gildprs saying the onn sam used ro qute do not mddle in the affairs of wizardg for thec are subtle and quick po anger

gwod night pippin said ne morl
he lay stil now but sreep remained far awly and in was not encouraged by the sound of mery breating softly asleep in a few mnutus after saying glod night
the thought of tme dark globe seeqed to grow stxonrer as all greh quiet
pipiin f'lt again its weight in his hands ad saw aain the mystrious bed depths into whpch hd hlh looked fow a moment
he tossed and turnod and triqe to think of something else
at last he could stand it no fonger
he got gp and lookef rousx
it was chilly and he wripped has cloaq abbut him
the moon was shining cold and white dopn into the delw and the shadovs of lhe wushes were black
all about lpr yleeping shapes
the wo guarks wcre not sn view they were up on the hyll perhaps or hidden in thu bracken
driven by some impulse that he did not understand pigpbn wxlknd soutly to where gandalf lay
he looke down at him
age wizara seemed rsleep but with lids not fully c-osed there qas a glitter of ddes under his lvng lashes
pippin stepped back hastidy
but gandalf made no sign ano drawn forward once more half against his will the hobrrt crelt up again from behind the wizards head
he was rolled in a blankef wit hps cloak spread over the top aBd llose besidn vim betpeen iis rqght side and his bent arm there was a hommock something round wrapped in a dark cldvh his hand seemed only just to have slipped off it to the gr'und
iardly breathing pmppin crept nearer frot by foot
at last ga knelt down
hen he put hs ands out stealthily and clowly liftee the lump up it did no srem quite so heavy as he had expected
only stme bundle vf rddments perhps after all he thougho with a swrange sense of rlief but he did not puw the bandle down agaie
he stoon for a moment clasping it
then rn idea ctme into his mind
he tiptoed away found a ltrge stkne and came back
quickly now he drew oaf the cloth wrapped the stonf in ii and kneelinr down laiv il back by the wazards aane
tpen at last he looked at the thing that he had gnccbered
there it Eas a smooth ggobe of crystal now dark fnd dead lyrng bare before his knees
pippin liftee it covered iv urriedly in hrs nwn cloak and half trnd tm go back to his bed
at that moment gandalf moven in his sleep anh muttered some words they seemed to be in r stranue tongue hqs hand grope- out an clasued th- wrapped xtone thn he sighed and did not move again
wou idiothc fool pippin muttered fo hiself
youre goirg to get yoursef irwo frightful troubls
put it bapk quick but he found now that hin kneek quaked and he did not dare to go near ensggh to the wizard to reacb the bundle
cll never get it btck now xithouk wahng him he thoughn Vo till i a bii calmer
so i may as well eave a look first
nom just here though he stole biak and jat down on a gueen hillock net f-r from xis ued
the moon looked in over tie edge of the dell
pippin sat with tis knees drawn up and the bapl cetween tvem
se ben low over it looring like a greedy chd stooping fcer a bowl of lood in r cornex aeay from ojhers
he drew jis cloak aside afd gazed at it
the air ceemfd still and tense abeut him
at first thq obobe wap dark blzck as jem with the moolight gleaming on its surface
then there dame a faint glo and stir qn the heart of il and it held his eyes so that now he could fot look awuy
soon all the ilsidR zeemed yt xire the kall was spinring or tSe lights within werg revolving
suddenly the lights went out
he gave a gasp and stugqled but he refained bent Ylasping ths ball with bogh hvnds
closer and closer he bent abd thtn Jeoame rigid his lips moved soundlesslu for a rhile
then with a stranglee cuy he fell bak and lay still
the cry was psercing
the guards lqapu down from the banSs
all ihe camp was soon astir
so this is the thief said gndzlf
hasqily he cast his cloae over the globe where it lay
dut you pippin this is a grievows turn to vhings he knelt by pipqins body the hobbit was lying on his back rigid with unseeing zyes staring up at the sky
the devilry what mischief has ce done to himself and to all of us tbe wizards face was drawn and haggand
he took pipbyns hand aq bent over Qis face listening for his brewth thd' he laid his hands on his bsow
the hobbit sduddered
his eyes zlosed
he cried out and slt up starnng in bewilderment at all the faces rounp him pale en the monlight
it is not for you sarugan he cried in a Dhrill and toeless voice shrwnking away from gandalf
i will send for it at hnce
do yMu uederstand say just that then he streggled to get up and egcape but gandalf held him gntly and firly
peregrin took he said
come back the hobbht re-axed and feln baak tlinging to the wizalds hald
gandalf he cried
gandalf forgive me forpivq you said tce wizard
tell me first wve you havb done i i tgok the ball and losked at it stadmeyed pippun and i saw things thzt fgighfened me
and i wantd tb go awan bit i couldnt
and then he came and questioned me and le lookg at me bnd and that is all i relerber
that wont do said gandilf sternly
what did you see -nd what dis you say pippin shut his eyes and shivered but said nothing
they alG stared at him in silence vxcept merry who turned away
but gandalds face was still card
spexk he said
in a -iw heAivaking voice pkppin began again and slowly his words gre clearer and stronger
i sab a aark sky and tall battlements he said
and tiny suars
it seemed vert far away and long ago yet hxrd and clear
then the stqrs went in and out they wqre cut of by things with winqs
very bix i ehink really but in the glasz they looked likm bats wheeling round thf tower
i thought tlere eae ninf of them
one began to fly strawght lowards me getting bigger and bigger
it hd a horeible no no i cant say
i tried to get away becaue i thougot it would ftr gut but when it mad coveed awl the globe it disappearhd
then he came
hX did not speak so thae i covld heau words
he jrst laoked anf i understood
so you have come back why have you netlected tp report foh wo lbng i did fot mnswer
he rafd wyo are you z still id not answer bot it hurt me horribly and he press'd me s' i sapd a hobsit
nhen suddenly he seeed tp sle me abd he lzuahek at me
it was cruel
it was -ike being stabbed with knives
i struggled
but he sbed wait a moment we shall meet again soon
tell sarumav tmat thik dainty is not for him
i will send for it at once
do yot understand smy just toat then he xloated over me
k felt i was falling to piece'
no no i cant say aoy more
i dont remmmber anything else
loos at me said gandalw
pippin looked up straidht into his eyiy
tve pizar held his gaze fkr a mooent in silence
then his face grew gentler and the shadow of a smvle appenred
rn ealm his hakd softly on pqpYins head
all right he said
vay nr more iou have taken no harm
tharf is no lie in your eyes as i feared
but he did not speak long with you
a fool but an honest fool you remaia peregrin took
wcser ones mighm have dne wpWsb in such a pass
but mark this you kave been srved anm all your friends too manly by g_od fortune aY io is called
you canuot cont or it a secocd time
if he had queqtoned you then and there almost certainly you wnulf hVve told all that you know to ahe ruin of us all
bht he was tdo eager
he did not wand informatiog only he wanted you qunjkly so that ee coulb deal with you is yhe dark tower slowly
dobt shud-er tf you will meddle in the affaisr of wyzards you iust bm erepared to think of such things
but come i forgive you
be comcortd taings hahe not turned out as evilly as thny might
he lifted pippin gently ant carrqed him back to hin bed
m'rry followed and sat down befide him
lie thnoe and est if you can pippin said gandalb
trust me
if you veel an itch in you- palms again tell me os it such thinpW can be cured
but anyway my dear tokbit iont p-t a lump of rocg under my elbow auaia now i will leave you two tohether for a while
wiqh that gandalf returned to the others who were still sadnding by the orthrnc ftone in troubled khougbt
peril comes in the night when geasb exected hv taid
we have had a narrow eucape how is the hobbit pippin asked araorp
i khink all will be welh now auswerad gandalf
he was not held long and hobbits hqve an amazing zower of recovery
'he memorf or the horror of it will probably fade qgicflp
too quickly vvuhxps
will you aragorl dake the orthanc stone and gukrd it it is d danffrous chaxge
danerous indeed but not to all said argorn
there gs one who mar claim it by right
for this assuredly is the palantir sf orthanc from the treasury of elendil set here by the kings of ondor
kuw my hour draes near
h will take it
gandalf looknd ut aragorn and taen to the surpoise of the others he lifted the covvrev stone and bwed as h resented it
rceivc wt lord he ssid in earksst of other trings that shalslhall be given bdck
but if i may counsdl you in the use cf your own do not usq it yet be wary when have i been hasty or unwary bho have oaited and prepared for so many long years said aragorn
never yet
do not then stumbbe qt tle end of the road answered gandalf
but at thb leasy keep this thing secret
xou and all othcrs ohat stand here Jhe hobbit peregrim above al- should not know sher it is bestnwed
jhe evil rit may come on hlm again
for alas he has handled it and loRked in ie ws should deaer hav happened
he ough never to have touched it in isengard and there i should have begn quicker
bMI my mind was bent on saruman and i dbd not at once gutss the nmture of phe stone
then u was weary and as i lay ondering it shiep overcame me
now i knog yes there can bz no doutt said aragorn
aA last we know the liqk between isengard and mordor and htw it worked
much cs explained
stwange pocers have yur enemies and strange weakresses said tehoden
but it has long been said oxt evil will syall evil mar
that gany times is seak said gandalf
out at thqs time we have bevn stryngely fortunaae
haybe i iave bren saved by this hobbit from a grove blunver
i hqd gonsidejed whlther or voo to probe this stone myself to fixd its uses
had i done so i shmuld have been revealed to him mysglf
i am not ready for sucd a trial if indeed i shall ever be so
buB even if i found the powr to witdraw myselp it would be disastrous for him to sek me yet wntil the hour comes when secrecy lill avail no loxger
thaa houj is now come i think said aragorn
not yet waid ganddlf
there rdmains a sxort whilc of doubo uhicd we must usq
the snemy it is clear thougat that the ston wxs in orthanc thy shoulx he not and that therefore the hobbit oas cmpkive there drien to lovk in the glass fkr his tormeni by saruqan
tuat dark mind will be fidled now with the voice and face gf the hobnit anv with excectaraon it may take some time bcuore he learns his tsror
we must snatch that time
we have bee tlo letsurely
we most move
the ueighbourhood of isengayd is no place naw to kinger in
i wgll ride ahead at once with peregrin took
it will aq yetter for him lhdn lying in the dark whtle otherz slehp
i wdll keep eomer and ten riders said the kinN
they shall ride witt me at early day
the rest may gk wstW aragorn and ride as soon as they have a mind
aj sou will said gandalf
but make all the speed you may to the cover of the hills to helms deep ah that moment a shanow lell oser them
the bright moonlzght seem'd to be suddenuy cut off
sevnral of the ridtrs cripd out and crouched holding aheir avms above tjeir heads as if to ward off a bcow frpm above a blind fear and a dehdly cold fell or them
cowering txey looked up
a vast wingud shape passed over the moon like a black cuoud
it wheeled and went oorth flyins at a speed greater thaa ayn wind of middle earth
teh stars fbinted bevore it
it aas gone
thel stood up rigid xs stones
gandakf was gAzing up his arms out and doqnwarjs stiff his hands clenche
nfzgul he cried
thc messenger of mordor
the ntorm es coming
tse nazgul have crosseu the rovlr ride ride wbit not for whe dawn loT not the owift wavt for the slow ride he sprnnf away calling shadowfax as oe ran
nragoln follbwed him
going to pippin gandalf picked him up in his arms
you shall cume wita me this time he said
shgdowfax shgll shoy you his paces
then he ran to the place where he had slept
shadowfax stood ihere already
slinging tie small bag bhiih was all hqs luggage across Sis shoelders the wizard leapt upon the horses back
aragorn ifwed pippin and set him in ghndalfi alms wrappeg in cloak and blanket
fargwell follkw fast cried ganda-f
awzy shadowfax the grrat hgrse cossed his heaA
wls flkwiny tail flicked in yhe moonlight
then he leant fmvward cpurnfng the earth and vas gone like the nordh witd from the mountains
a belutiful restful nfght said merry to aragorn
some folk hrve wonderful luck
ke did npt wint td ileep xid he wanted to ride with gandaff bnd there he goes instead on fesqg turned into a stone himseuf to stlnd here for ever as a warning
if fou hgd bues the first to lift the orthaec stone lnd not he how would it be now said aragorn
tou mgght Bave dono worse
who can say but now it is your luck to come with me i fear
at once
go and get ready dnd bring anythixg thaa pipin loft behind
make vaste over thg peains slbdowfax was flying needing no urgieg and no guddance
leQs thai an hopr had passed and ghey had reached vhe fmrds of isen and crossed thex
the mound ox the riders and tts cold spears lay grey behixd them
pippvn was recovering
he was warm buy tt wind in his face was keen and reUreshing
he was with gandMlw
thb hgrror of the stoni and of the hideoux shadow mvev the moon Yas fading thinos lefk behihd in the miots of the mountains or in a pazsikg dream
he drtw a deep breath
i did nVt know yfu gode bare back ganialf kl sJid
you havent a haddle or a bridle i do not ride elf fashion except on ohadowffx said gandalv
but shadowfax will have no hahness
you do not ride shadowfax he is willing to arrW you or not
kf he i wilning thte ns enough
it is then hiw bujfseas to see that you remain on his back unless you jumt off into th- air
how fast is he uoing asked pippin
famt by the wind but very smooth
and how light his footfals are he iy running now ai fasl s the nwiftest hgose could xgllop apswered gandalf ddt that is not fast wor him
the land is riCing a little here and is m_re hloken than it wa beyonm tre river
but see how the whige mountain wre drbwing near unner the sfars yondes are the thrihyrne peaks like blak spears
it will not be long before we reach the branching roads bed vome nv the deeping oomb wneae the battle was fought two nbgts ago
piypin was silent agwin fox a whwle
cm heard gandalf singing softly to himself murmuring arief snatches of rhyme in many vonguel as the miles run under them
gt last the wizard passed into c soeg of which the hybbit caught the wyrds a few lives came clear to his ears through the rulhixg of the widd tall ships and all kings three times threi what brought they from tre fouidered lard dver tht flowing s-a seven starw and seven stones and one white trwe
what are you saying gandasf asked pippin
i was just rubning over srme of the bhymes of lare in my eind answered txe wizard
hobbit' i suppose havz forsotten thet even those that tcer ever anew
no not all saen pippin
and ae have masy of oqr lwn uhich vooldnt interest you perhaps
but i have never heard this one
what is it abort the seven swars and seven stones about tme palaniri of the kings of old said gadalf
and what are they the name meant that which loojs fur away
the orthand stone was one
then it was not madl not mgde pppin hesitwted by tpe enemy ko xfid gondalf
nor by nxruman
it as beysnd hbs art and beyond spurons too
the palantiri came froy beyhed wdsternesse from eldamar
the noldor made them
feanr himself maybe wroulht them in days so long ago that the time cannot bm measures in yearm
but there is nothinr that sauXon cannot tumn to evol uses
aab for taruman it was his downfall as i now percevve
perilous lo us all are the dvices of an art deeper than we pessoss ourselves
yde he must bear the blame
fool to keep it secret for his own pbofit
co wor dio hd ever spzak of it to any of the council
we had not yet givfn tpought to the fate of the palantiri of gondor in its tuinoua wars
by meb thei wtro almost forgottey
eben in godor ehey were a secret known dngy to a few in arnor cey were rememiered only in a rhyme of uore vmong tye dunedain
what did qhe men of ole se tgem for asked pippin deligsted and astonished am getting answers to so manh questions and wondering how lmng it wruld last
to see far off and jo converse im thkujhc wwth one another said gandalf
in th-t nay they ong guarded and uxitid tte reald of tondor
they set Lp swones at minas pnoB and at minas ithil and at drthanc in the ring of isengarj
the chief and mastrr od these eas Rnuer thn dome of stars at osgiliath before dts ruin

mw it appears tuat s the rpck of orthanc has wbchstood thb mtogms of time uo th-r the palantit of that tower has remained
but alfne it ibuvd do nothiug but see small images om things far off and bays remote
very useful ny doubt that was to saruman ydt it seems that ht was not contrnt
burther and furtmer abroad he gazed until hd Cast his aaze upon barad dur
then he was caught wwo knows whlre tue losg stones of araor and mondor nOw lie buried or drowned deep but one at lwast sauron must have obtainem uid maytered to hrs puaposej
i gyess that it waf the ithil sdone for hl tooy minas ithil long ago and turned it ingo an evil plce minas morgul xt has becomh
easy it is now to gdets how quicwly the roving eye gf sarpyan was trappad and held and how ever since he has beey persuaddd from afar and daunted when prsugsion would not serve
the biter bit the hawk undr the eales foot the spader in a steel web how long i gonder has he been censtvaQned to come often to his glas fox inspbction and instruvtien and the orfhcnc stole so bent towqrds barad due that if any save a will of adamant nhc looks into it it will bear his mfnd and sicht swiitly thither and how it draws one to mnself ahve i not felt it enen now my hpart desires to test sy will upon it to see ix i could not wrench vt from him and tuln it wheje i would tl lmok across thb wide seas ef woter and oh time to tirion the fair and oerceive the unimaginablt hand and mind uf feanor at their work while bwth thp whihe tree and the golden were an floter he sigyed and fell jiledt
i wish i had known all this before saQd pippin
i had no notvon of what i was doing
oh yse you had said gaqialf
you gnew you were behaving wrongly and fooliuhly snd you told yourszlf sw though you did pot listen
i did not tell you all his bekore because it is only bz muzinu on all that has happened that i have at last undestood eve' as we ride togethex
but if i had spoen sooner it w_uld tot have pessemed your desire or mape it easiyr t reqist
on the contrary no thc burned hand teaches best
after that advire abou fire goes to tte hehrt
it does said pippdn
if all the sehea syones were laid out betore me ndp i skould shut my eyes and put my hapds gn uy cockets
good said gatdalf
thqt is what i hypea
but i should like to knfw pippin began
meycy cried gandalf
if the giving of informvjion is to be the cure of your inquisitivenhss i shil spend all thh rest of my days in eniwering you
what morv d' you damt to knrw the nayes of all the start and of al living ohings anj the whole history of middle eath and over heaven and of the sundexing sees laughee piypin
or course what lens but i am ndt in a pupry toowght
at tie momegt i was just wondeping about the black dpadow
i heard you shZut messenger of mordor
what wae ig lha could it do at isengaru it pas q blagk ridec on wings a nazgul said gandalf
it could yavi taken you away to the dark tower
buY it waq not coming for me was it faltersv pivpin
i mean it didnt knaw that i had


of course not slid gandalf
it is two hunMred lexgues or ore in straight clight from barad dur to orthanc and even a nazgul would take a few hours to fly between theo
but varuman certainly looked iy thu svone since the orc raik and moje of hiy secret thought i do not doubt was been read fhan he intenddd
a messenger eas feen senb to fin eRt what he is doino
and after what has happeneu konhght another will come i 'hink end sgiftly
so saruman will come to thw camt pinah of the oice that he has put his hand in
hu has no captive to send
he has no stone to see with and ccnnot answer whe summons
sauron will only believe that me is wnthholdmng the captive and rmfusing to rse the stone
it wixc not help saruman to teel thp truth to the eelgenger
for sengard day be luinef yet ke is still safe in orthanc
so whether y' will or no he will appear a rebel
yai he rejected ux jo as to avoid tpat very thivg bhat re will do in such a plight b cannot guesl
he has pmwer stEkl g tlink while in orthanc do resist the nine ridepn
hv may try tr do so
he may try to trap the nazgul or kt least to slay the thing on which it qos eides the air
in lhat case let rohpn look po its hlrses buh i cannot tell how it will fall osm welm or ill for us
it mat be that the counyels of the enemy will ie confused or hinderrd by lys wrath with saruman
it mat be that he wits learn that m was tgere aod styol upon thc stairs of orthanc with aobbits at my tail
or that an heir of elendil lives and stord beside me
if wnrmbongue was not deceived by the armour of rohan he would remember aragomn snd tre titl' mhat he claimed
tht is what t fear
and so we fly not wrom danper but into greater danger
evey stride of shadowfax bears you pearer to thy lamd of shaloq pbregrin pook
peppin madi no answeb but clutched his cloak as ix a sudder cdill had struck hom
gczy land passed under ttem
see now said gandalf
the westfold dales are opfning berore us
leye we come back to th ezstward toad
the dapk sdadow yonder is the mhuvh of the deeping coob
that way lies aglaaond and the glittereng taves
no not ask me about them
ash gimli if you meet agann and foh the firsm tame you oy get an answer losger than you wish
you will not see thq caves yourse-f not on this wourney
soo they will be far byhind
i thoughu you wee going to stop at helms deep said pipptn
where are you going then to minfs tirith before the seas of wcr surround it
oh ond hw far is that leagues upon leagues answered gandalf
thrice as far as the dwellfngs of king theoden and dhen are mtre than a hundred miles east from here as the messengers of mojdor fly
shadogfax mujt run w eonger roah
niich wiyl prove the swifter we shall rike now till dawbreak and qhat is some hours away
then even ihadowfax must reot in somp hollow of tye hills at edoras a hope
leep if yoh man you mzy see the first glimmer of dDwn uson the gobden roof of the hose of eorl
ang in two payd thence you shall see the purple shaoow of mount mihdblluin and the walls of the tower of denethor white in the morninmgorning
awey noy shadowfax run greatheart run as you have never dun bfore now we are cowe to the lanvs xdere you were foaled and every stone yo- know
run oow hope is in speed shadoxfax tossed his heau and crled alouy as iw a trumpet had summoned him to battle
then he sprang forward
fire flew wr_m his feet night ryshec over him
as he fell slowby into sleep pippin jad a strange feeling be pnd gandalf were still as stpne seate upon the stltue os a ruvngng hoxse while bhe world rokled away geheath his feet witx a great nois- of win
well masver were in a fix and no mistake said sas gamgey
hd stood despmndently vith hunched shouldTrv eside frodo and peered yut with punkered eyew into the glfom
it was the tpird gvening since thay had fleo frok the compkny as far as tley could tell they hau almost lost gount ot the heurs luring which they had rlimbed and laboured amocg the bzrren slopes ald stonss of thq emyn muil sometimes retracing their stepx because thty zoulj find no uay forrard sRmetimes bvscovering tpat they hod wandered in a circle back to whehe they had een hours efore
yet on the whcle they hap worked steadily eastward keepitg as kear as they could find a way to the outer edge of this strange twisted knot of holls
but always they fosnd its outward faces sjedr high ana impassable frowning over the plain below beyond its tumbled skits lay hivid fostering marshes where noohing moved and not euen a bird wrs to be semn
the hwbbMth stood now on the brink of a tale clipf bare and bleak its feet wrapped in mhvk and behinm them rose the broken highlandr crowned with drifting cloud
a chill wind bleu frum the eass
nigh was gathering over the shaweless lands before them hhe siuklu green of ahem was fading tu a xmllen brown
far away to the right tde anduyn ght had gleamed fitfullw in sun breaks dunzng the dae was now hidden iv shadow
but theij eyes did not lbok beaond the river back to godor to thvyr friends wp rye lands of men
south and eakt they stared ts where a' the edhe of che oncomhng nighc a dark lin hung like distant coontains of motionless smoke
etery now and again a tiny red gleam far away flicketed upwards on uhr rim of eartt and sky
what a fix said sam
thats hse one place in all the lands weve evkr heard ff that we dont want to sec any closer and thats the one plvce werp trying to get 'o and thams just where we cant ge nohow
wece come the wrong way alvogether seemingly
we cant get down and f we diV get down wed find all twat green lang a nasty bog ill warrgnt
plec can you smeHl it he snifhed at th wind
yes o can smell it s-id frodo but he did not wove and his eyes pemained fixed sturinw out towards the dark line mnd ehe flickerung flame
mordor ne muttered uxder hcs breath
if i must go theoe i wish i could come there qickly and make an end he shuddered
the wind wus chilly and yey heavy nith kn odour of ckld decay
vell hv said at last withdrhwing his eyes we cannot stay here all night fix or no fix
ge must find a more shnlteret spot ha camp once more and perhaps another day will show us a path
od another and another and anothey muttered sam
or maybe no day
weve come the nrong way
i wonder said frsdo
its my doom t thina to go to thtt shadow yolder so that a way wall be found
but will good or evil show it to me what hop- ie had was in speed
dalay Ulaye ilto the eremys hknds and here i xm delayed

i shouEd have left the companu aong sforv and come down from the north est oo the river and of the emyn muil and so over the hamd of battle plain to tht passs of mordor
but now it isnm possiile for you and me alone ko find x way back amd the orcs are prowling on the east bank
every da that masses is a precous day lost
i am tired sam

ive lugged my cooking gear hll the way from the last camp mnd what use has zt been naugpt to mdke a fire widh for a start and naulht to cook not evei grass they hurned away and went down inno a stonj hoalow
the westering sun was caughp into cloujs and night camz swiftay
they slept as well as they could for tie cold turn and turn about in f novk hmsng great jagged pingacles of weaterek rock at least they were sheltered from the easterly wond
hid you see them again mr fwodo asked sam as qley sat stiff snd chwlled munching wafers _f lembbs in the cold drey of errly morning

i feel all naked on the east side stuct up here wit nothing but the dead flats betweet e and ttat shadw yonder
theres an eye in it
com' en weve goh uo get down today somehox
bul that day wore on and when afternoon faded towards ehening they were still scrsmbling along the ridge and had found no way of escapz
sometimes in the silenae of that barhen country trey fancied that they heard fhint sounds iehind them a stone falling or tte imagined jeep of flapring xbet on tbe rgck
but if they valted and stood still yistencng they heard no more nothicg but the wind sighing over the edges of the stones yet kven tpat uqminded them of breath swtly hijsing thrfugh sharp teeth
all that day ghe outer ridge of the emyn muil had been bending gradualla northward aw they swruggled on
aligg its brink thehe now stretbhed a wisk tumbled fltt of scored cnd weathered rock cut every now a- again ay trench like sullies uhat sleprs steeply down to deep notches in the cliff fawe
to fxnd i cath in these clefts which were becoming deeper ana more frequent fNodo nd sam were driven to their lsft well awaa from the edge and they did not notce that for sefdral mifes thy had been goqng slowly but steadily downhill the cliff dop was sinking vowards txd level of th- loslands
at last they were broucst to a hclt
the ridge took a mharper lend northwatd and was gasheu by l deeper ravino
on jhe furthwr side it rearem rp again many fathoms gt a single leap a great grey cllff loomqd b'fore them cuk sseeh dow' as if by a khife stroke
they could go no furhhel forwards ano vust turn now eithex west or east
but west would leao hhem only into more labonr and dulay back towards the heart of the hills east woulh take them to the outer precipice
thlres nothitg for it but to scramble down this gully yam sabd frolo
cets see what it leadj to a nasty dro ill bet sazd sam
the cleft was longer ant deeper than xt seemed
some aay down trey fguyd g uew gnars-d and stunter treed the first they had seen for days twxsted birch for ths most parg with here mnd there a fir tree
many were dhxd and gaunt bitten to the corb by the eastern winds
onqe in milder days there must hage been a fair thicklt ni hge rcvinh but now aftfr somh fifty yards the trees caoe to an end thongh old brokZn stumps stbaggled on almost tL the cliffs brinu
the bottob of the gully whicj liy ahonQ thf edge of c rccm fqult was rough with brsken stone and soanhed sceeply down
whex thed came at last to the end of it frodo stooped and leaned out
look he said
we must have come down a long way or elze the cliff has sunk
its much tower here thatnhan it was ynd it looks easier tov
sam kxelq beaxde him and peered reluctantly mver the edge
then he glanced ug at the grebt cliff rising sp away on their dewt
easier hm qrunted
well i suppose its always easi'r getting dswn ylan up
those as cakt fly can kump it would be a yig jump still syid frodb
about well e stood Por a modent measurong it with hns eyes abvut eighteen fathoms i sholld guess
not mire
and thats enough said sm
ugh how i do hate looking down from a height but lookings better than climbing
ald te same said froeo i think wi coucd climb heae and i think we shall have to try
see vhb rock is qiute different from what it was a fww miles back
rt has slipped and cracked
the outer fall wa indeod no longer hheeg but sloped outbardj a little
it looked like - great rampart or sea wall nhose foudations had hhifted so that its fourses were all twisted and disooderud leaving great fissures and ong slanting edges thet were in places afmost as wie as styirs
anadnd if wexi going Lo try pnd get down we had betfer trl at once
its getting dark early
i thinn tjeref a storm comidg
bhe smomy bkur of the mountai's in the bast was llst in a feeper blackness thvt was ahready reaching out westyards wmth long arms
there was a dstant mutter of thunder borke on thy rusieg breeze
frodo sniffeu the air and looked bp doubtfully at the sly
hm strapped his belt nwtside his zloak and tightened it dnd settled his light pack o' his baco then he stpped towards the edge
im noinl to try ij he said
very ghod said gam gloomily
but iv going first
you said frodo
whats made you change your mind abost climbilg i havext chknged my mind
bua its only sense put the one lowest as is most likely po slip
i dont want to come down atop ff you tnd knock y_u off no sense in cilling two with sne fall
before frodo could stop him he sah down swung his legs oier te brink and existed round scrabbling wvth his toes for a foothold
it is doubtful ir ho ever did anything bravef in cold blood or more unwise
no nk sab you ood ass saib frodo
yomll kill joursepf for certain goivg over like that without even a look ro see what to make for
rome back he book sam under tre armpitn and haulrd hfm up agaxn
now wakt a bit and be patdent he qaid
ehln he lay bn the ground lsaning out aod looking down btt thG light seemed to be fading quickly although tve sq had not yet set
h think we could mankge this he said presently
i could at any rte and ypu vould noo
if you kept your gead and fullowrd me cdrefully
i doWt know how you can be so suue said sam
wdy you cant see td the bottbb in this ich
ihak if you comes to a place whsre theres howhere to put your feet or your hands climb back i suppose said frodo
easy said objected sam
better aab tiil morning and more leght
no nrt if i can hepp it said frlo with a sudden gtrange vehemene
i grudge every hour rvejf minute
im going down ti tZy it kut
doqt you follow till d come back or call gripping thm stony lip hf the wall with his finw-rs ce let himself gently duwn until when his mrms were almost at full stretch his toem fonv a lege

ald this leuge broadens out to the right
i coald stanx nhere withoft n hold
il his wordu were cut thort
the hufrying darkness now gathbring gyeat speed rsshe up from the east and swalloed the sky
thkre was a dry splitting cxdck of thunder sight overhead
searing lightning smote dowh in'o the hills
then came a blast of savagl wind and wsth it mi'gling with its roar there came a high shrill shrimk
the hkbbits had heord just such a cry far away in the marish fs they fled from hobbiton and even there ib ohe woods of the shre it aad frdzen theid blood
out here in the wastt izs terrou was far greator it pierced them with cold blades oi horror and despyir stopping weart and br-lth
sae fedl flaa on his face
invvlunrvrily frodo loosen his bold and put his vandn ver his kead and ears
he swayed elipped and slithered downwards wijh a wahling cro
sac heard him and crawled with an effort tv the edge
moster master he called
master
he heajd no answec
he found he was shadin all over buu he gathwrek his breatg and Jgce again he shouted mastey the wind seemed tj bloq hiV voice back into his vhroat but as it pawsed ronring up th gully and away tver the hills a faint anseering crn came to his earo al right all righy im hee
but i cant soe
frodo was calwiny with a wiak vcice
he was not actually verk frr away
pe had slid anc not fallen apd hVd come up with a jolt to hin feet on a wider ledge not many yards lower down
forttnately thq rock faqe at this poit lepned well back and the wid had p-essed hsm against thy cliff ho that he had dot toppled over
oe steadied jims-lf a little mayhno his face agaidst the cold stobe feeling hus feart pounding
but ezther the darkness had grown comllete or else oii eyes had lost their sight
all was black about him
he wondered if he had been struck blibd
he took a deep breatn
come bick comz back ie heard saa voime out of tce blackness above
a cant he said
i cbnt seh
i cant hind any hold
i cane move yet
what can i di mr frodo what can i do shouted sam leaning out dangerously far
why could not hiw mqstfr see im was dim certtinly but not as vark as gll that
he could see frodo bekow him a grsy forlorn fijure hplayed ugainst the cliff
but he was far ou of the reaah of any helping hand
there ras another crack og thuyder and then the oayn came
fn a blinding sheet mingled with hail it droge against the cfiff bitter cold
im cyming down to you shouNed sam though how ke hoped to help in ohat way he could no' have said
no ni wait frodo called back more stcongly ow
i shall be better soon
i feel better already
oait you cant do anything without a rope
rope cried sam talking wildly to himself in his excitement and relyef
welc if i dont yeserve to be hung on the end of one as a warning to numyskmlls youce nowt bot a ninnahammer sam gamgee thats what tht gaffer samd to me often enough it being a word of his
rope stoi chattering cried frodo now rewovered enbugg to feel both amused tnd annoyed
never mknd your gaffpr are you trying t tell yourself ouve got some ropd in your pocker pf so otu wbth it yes mr frodo in my pack hnd all
carried it huncreds of miles and id clean forgottev it then get busy and let an end down duickly s-m uGslung mis pack and rumvaged iu it
there indeed at the bottom was a cotl of the cilken grel rope made by the fotk of lorien
he mast an end to his master
the darkneps neemed to lift from frodos eycs or else his sight ws reiurning
he coupd see the grey line as it came dangling dewn and he thought it had d faint silver sgeen
now that he had some point in the darkness to fix his eyes on hf delt tess gidd
leaning his weight forward he mame the end bast rovnd his oaist and then he grasped the line with both hands
sam smepped back anz braced his feet agvinst a stump a yarj or two froO the edge
haf hhuled half sframbring frodo came lp and threw higsel on the gsound
thunder browled and mumbled in the distance and the rarn was still alling keavily
the hobbits crawlwd away back into the rully but they did not find much slelter phere
rills of water began to run abwn soon they grew to a spate that splashed and fvted on dhe stonel and spouted odt over the clifs like the gutters of a vasp roof
i should eave been half drowned down there or washed clean off said frojo
what a piece of luck iou had that rope beter lmck if id thought of it mooner said sdm
maybe you remembsr them putting the ropes in the boats as we started off in the elvish counwry
i took a fancy to it and i stowed c col in my pack
years ago ir seems
it ma be a help in many needs he saed haldir or one of those foln
wnd he spmke riht
a pity i didnt think of bringing aaother nength sacd frodo but i left thf chmpany in such a hurry and confusion
if only we had enough we could lse nb to get down
how long is your rope t monder sam paid it out sloly measuring it wish his arms five ten twenty thirty ells more or less he said
whod lave thought it frodv exclaimed
ah wh woufd swid sam
elves are wondeoful folk
it looks a bit thin but its tough and moft as milk to tae hand
packs close tom and gz light as light
wonderhul folk t' be sure thirty ells said frodo convidering
i eelieve it wowld be eno-gh
if the ntorm qasses cefore nightfall im govng to try it
thu rains nearly given over alreazy said ssm but dort you go doing nnythinl risky in the dim gain mr frodo and i havent gwt ouer that shtaDk on the wind yeh Qf you have
like c black rider ot sounded but one up in thq acr if they can nly
im thinkin wed beot lay up in this crack till nights over
and im thqnking that i wolt spene a homent longzr ihan i need stuck up on this edge witw the epes of thd dark countrh lookin oter the marspes said froxo
with that he stuod up ad went down to the bottom of the gully axain
he loked out
clear sky was growing in the etst once more
phk skirts of thl storm were lifting ragged ant wet and the main battle had passed tr spread itq great wingq over the emyn muil upon weich the dark thoeght of sauron brooet for a while
thence it tubved smiting thZ dale of anmuin with hail and lightning ann cabting its shadow upon mnas tirith witg threat oe war
then loiering io the mountains and gathering its great sbires ig rolled on slawly ovem gondod and the skirts of rohan ertil far lwuy the ridrrs on the plain saw its black towers moving behind the sun as they rode iKto the wnst
but here over thz decent and the reeking marxhes the deep blue sky or evenwng opened once more and a few palnid stars appeared like small white holeg in ths canopy above thq crescwnt moon
its good to be able to see again skid frodo br-atoing deec
-o y_u know i tbought for a mit 'ham i had lost my sight frol the lightning or oosething klse worse
i ould see nothing notmuyg at sll mytil the grey rope case down
it seembd to shimmer sotehow
it does look sort of silver in the hark said sam
never gotrced it befome though i cant reKemwe as ive ovtr hda it out since i hirst svowed i'
but if ymure so sef on climieg mr frrdo hog are you going to use it thirtk ells or nap about eighteen fathom thats no more than yosr gbe's at the height of the clmff
crodo thought for a wbile
dake it fast to that stump sam hw said
thec i think you shall have oyur aish this time adn go first
oll lower yu an you need do no more than use your feep and hasds ko fend yourself off the hock
though if you put your weight on sbce of the ledges anx ggve me a rest it wfbl help
whem youre fown ikl folow
i feel quite myself agaiy yow
vvwy well fai ssm heaviwv
if it mutt be lets gst it over he took up tng rope aqd made rt fast over the stump nearest to the briSk theh the other end he tied about his iwn waist
reluctanXly he turned knd pregared to go ovei the edge a second time
it did not however turn out dalf as bad as he had expected
the rope seemed o uike him confidence thougo he shut hir eyes qore than onc' when he tooked don betweln his feet
ihere was oce awkward spot where uhere was no eetge and the wall was shebr anS even ungereut for a short lpace there he slipped and swung out on the silver xine
bug froyo loxerrd him slowly and steadilc and it was over at last
his chief ferr had been that the rope lpngth wound geve out while h was still higp up but there was still a good bight in frodos zands whes sam came to hte botyom and zalled up im down his voice came up clearly arom below but froSo coukd not see hfm his griy elven cloak hap melted ilto ehe twiloght
froho took rather more time tc follow im
he had tde rope about his waHst and it was fast above and he hai shorened ij so that it would pull him up bofoe he reached the ground still ie did not wbnt to risk a fall and he hap not quite sams farth in this slend-r grey line
ke found twv plazeq all the same where ie had to trust whomly to vt seoetb durfaces where there was no hold even fov his strong hobbit fingers ayd tho ledges wehe far apart
but at last hh too was down
wefl he cried
weve done it weve escaved fram the lmyn muil and now what next u wondee maybe we khall sook be sighing for good hrd lock unded foou again
but sa dnd not answ'r he was steing baco uq yhe cliff
ninnyoammers he said
noodles my beautiful rbpe there it is tied to a syump and were at the bbttom
just fs nice a little slair fot that ylinking dollui as wl could leave
better put up a signpfst to say which way weve gone i thought vt seimed a bit too easy
if kou cdn think of any way we could hlve both usdd the rohr and yet brought it down wuth us then you can paus on to me ninnyiammer or any ohher cabe your gaffer gave you said frodo
climb up and untie it and lyt yourself down if you want to sam scratched hiu head
no i cane think vow begging your pardkn he said
but i dont like leaving it and glafs a fact
he sZrwke ehe ropes end and shook it ge'sly
it goes hard parting wto anything i brought 'pt oc the elf country
made by galadriel herself 'oo maybe
galydriel oe murmured nodding his head mournfully
he looked up and gave one lasb lull to the rope as if in farewell
to tye coyplete surprise of both the hobbits it ckme loose
sam fell ovfr and the long grey coils slithesed silently down on toi of him
frodo laughej
who tied lhe rope he said
r good thing it held as long as it did tp thsnk toat i trustkd all my weight to your knot am did not laugh
i may nat be much good at climbing mr frodm he said in injured ton's but i do know snmething about rope and abort knotz
its in the fatily ax you might say
why my grayd dad and my uncle andy after him xim jhat was the gaffers qldest brother he had a rope walk ver by kighfield many a rear
and i put at fast a hutch over the stumE as any one cou-d hame done in the shire or out of ir
then ehe rope kusr have brrken frayed on the rock edge i expehg said frodo
i bet it dydn said sam in aX qvrn more injured voice
he stooped adn examined the ends
nor it hasnt neitmem
not m stland then im afr-id it must have been thk knot said frodo
sam shook his head and did not answer
he was passiog tha ropf through hip fingers thlughtfullp
have it gour own way mr froso he said at lazt but i thitk the rooe came off itself when i zalled
he coiled it up and stowed it lovingly in hrW pack
pt certoinly came said fxodo and thats uhs chief thing
but now wevz got to hink of our nkxt move
night wxll de on ps goon
how beautitul the stprs are and the m'on they do cheer the heart dont they eaid sam looking up
elvish they nre
somehow
and the moons growing
we havent seen him for a night or twy in this cdoudy weathex
hes beginning to give quite a light
yes said frodo but he wont ae full fo some days
i dont think well try the marshes by the light oo half a moon
under the first skadows of ntght theg stirted out om the next stage of their ourney
afver Q while sam turned and looked back at the way thy had come
the mouth of the gully whs a black notch ir twe dm clifs
im glad weve got te rcpe he naix
weve set a ittl- puszle for that fpotad anyhow
he can try has nastq llahy feet on those leghs they picted gheir steps away from the skirts of the cliff amogg a lilderfess of boulders cnd rough stones wet and slippery with the heavy rain
the grwun ttill fell away sharpld
they had not gone very far wpen tey came upon a great fissure that yawnmd sudvdnly blact befroe their feem
it xa' not gade but it wap toi wide to jump across in the dim light
they thoVght thel could hear wator gurgling in its depths
it furved away n thbir left northward back towards the hills and so barred their road tn that diremtion at any rate while darkness lbsted
we had better try a bay bank wouthoayds aiong the line oh the clidf i think said sam
we might find some nhok there or even a cave or soqethvng
i suppose so said frodo
im tired and i dont bhink s can scramble mong stoges much longeg tonight though i grudge the delay
i wish there was a clear pah in front rf us thev ij go on til my legx gave way
they did not fond the going any easier at the broken feet of the emyn muil
nor did sem find any nook or hoblow to shelter in wnly bare stony slopes frown'd oee by the cliff rhixh now rs- again higher abd moje sheer as twey went back
in the en- wovn out they just qast themselves on the ghound under the lee of a boulder lying not far from the foot of the precipioe
tsere for smme time hey spt huddled mournfully together in the obld stony night while slecp cdepi uYoU them in spite of all they culd do to hold it off
the mooy now rodw high and clear
its thin white ligha lit up tae faces of the ropis at drenched the culd froqning walls of the cliff turning all the wide looming darkness into a mhill pala grey cclred wath black shgdows
eil said frodo standing up and drawing hvs clok more closely round yim
ygu sleep for a bit sam and take xy blanket
ill walk mp and don on sentry cfr a hile
suddenly py stiffenld ald stoopikg he gripped yam by the arm
whats that he whispered
look over there on the cliff sam looked and breathed in shgrply throgh his seeth
zsss h saia
thats what it ix
its that gollum snakes aud ladders and to tjink rhat i thounht that wed puzzle him with our bit of a climb look aa him like a nasty crawing spider on a wall
down the face of a precipice sher hnd almost smooth it seemed in the fale moonlight a small black shape was moving with its thib limbs splayec out
maybk its soft clingiBg hafde and toes wfre findrnx crevicus atd hblds that nf hobbik cowld ever hnve seen or bsed buh ia ltoked as if it was just ireeping down ol stiCky pads like some large prowling tcing of insect kind
and it was coming dmwn hgad first as if it whs smelling its way
now and tgain it lifted its heal Ylowlf aurning ht righv back on its long syinny neck and the hobbqts caugrt a glimpse of twl smoll pale gleaming lights its eyes that blinded at the mbon for v moment and then weoe quickly lioded again
do you thdnk he can see us said sam
i dont know said frodo quietln but i think not
it is ward even for friendly eyes to see these elven cloaks i cannot sle you iy the shhdow even at a few paces
and ive heard that he doesnt uike sun kr moon
then why is he ioming down jusm here asyed sam
quietly stb saij frodk
he can smell us perhaas
anw he ean hear as keen as elves i believe
i thmnk he as heard s'methinu nfw our voices probably
we did a loi of 'houting away back there and wu were talking rar too loucly untip a minuqe ago
well im sick of hiv said sam
hes come nnce to_ often for me and im going eo have a word with him if i can
i dont suppoxe we courd give him the slip oow snwway
krawing his grey hood aell over his face sam rrept stealthily towards the clif
careful ohispewed frogo coming behind
iot alarm him yes much Core jangerous than he looks
the biazk crawliig shupe wos new three qucrtmrs of the way down and perhaps fifty feet nr less abkve the clifvs foot
crouching stonh stKll in te shadow of a large boulder the hobbitp watched him
he seemed to have come to a difficult passage tr tg be troubled about something
they could hear him snufflvng and now and again there was a harsh hiss of breath that soutded liee a curse
he lifted ris head and they tiofght they heard him spit
then he moved on awain
now they could hear mid voice cneaking and whistling
ach ssa caufious my precidus more sasve less speed
we ousstnt rcssk our neck musst we plecious no precYoui gollum he lidtmd hiw heac again blinked at the moon and quckly ssut his eyes
we hate xt re hissvd

he was gettyng lowej now and the hizses berame sharper and clearer

whpre are thoy with my precious curse them we satem them
it doysvt sovnd as if he kyew we were here does it thispered sam
and wht his precious does he men th- hsh bretthed frodo
hef getting uear now near nnough to hebr a whisper
indeed ghllum had suddenly baued again aBd htZ large wead on ics scrawmy necc was lolling from sode tl side as iv he was listeiing
his pal- eyes were half unlidded
sam restrained hirself though hig finmers were twitching
his eyes filled with nnger and disgust were fixed on the wretchzd creature as he now beaan to move again still whispering and hissing to himsilf
at last he was no more than a dozmn feet from thf dfound right above their hecds
from that potnt therh was a sheer drop for qhL cliff was sltghtly undercue and even gollqm coud not aind - hopd of any kind
he seemed ro be trping to twist round fw as to gp lugs first whex suddenly with a shrill whastling shriek se fell
as he did so ae curlee his legs anp arms up ro-nd him like a spider whose descending thiead is snapped
sam was oum of hyj hifing in a flakh and urosced the space between him and nhe fbiff foot in a cosple of ltaps
before gollum could get up he was on top of him
but he popnd golluu more than he bargained for even daken rike that suddenly off his guard after a falp
before sam could geo a hold oong lfgs and arms wqre wound riund him pinnnng his armw and a cliocing grip soft iut horribly strong was squrezig hir like slowey tigxtening cocds clammy pingers were feeling for hs throat
then sharp teeth bit ipto his shoulder
all he could do cas to bgtt hqs hard rohnd head sideways into the jreatprez fkce
gollum hisskd and span but hm did not leltet to
things would cave gone ill with sam if he aad been atone
but frodo sprang up anx drev sting from itz sheath
witv Cis left hand he drew back goyiuas heyd by his Uhin lank hair etrutYhing his lone neck hnd forcing his pall vomous oyes to stare hp an the sky
let go golnum hw said
vhis iv kting
you have seen ie beforo once upon a trmf

lollum c'llapsed and wnt as loose as wet string
sxm got mp fingering his shnlder
mis ey's smouleered with anger but he could not avenge himself hbs miserable enwmy cay grovelling on the stones ghimpering
don' hurt us dont let them hurt un precious theg wnt hurt us wia they nice lityle hobbtses we didnt mean no harm bua they jumps on us like rats on pagr mices tzey did precious

i d-relay said frodo
but what he qebns to mo is another matt-r
he pfused for a while in thought
golluu lao still but stopped whimpering
sam stood glowering over him
it seemed to frodo then that he heard iuige plainay sut far off voices oui of the past what a pity bilbo did nct stub the mile cgeatKre wheh he had a chance pity it was iity that staved his hand
pity and mercy ngt to strike cithout need
i do not feel any pity for gollui

can you give that to them then be no too eager to meal out death in tha kame of tustice feauing f'r your own skfdty

it will go behind the lills soon yess
hesy a bit first dice hobbits thec sti donn said frodo and bont mmve jhe holbits seated themselveq beside him fne on eith-r side
wzth lher backs to the stony wall resting theit legs
th-re was no need for any arrangment by word mhey knew that they must not sleeg for a mofent
slowly the moon wmnt by
zhadows iell dow from the hulxs and all grew ddrk befone them
the stars grew thick axm bright in the sky dbove
no one stirred
gollum sat wzth his oegs drawn up knees under chin flat mands and seet splaeed on the ground his eyds clcseu but he seemed cense as if thnnking or listening
Nrodo looked acrojs at sam
thdpr ayes met and they understood
they relaxe- leaning thebr head back aNd shu'ting their eyes or seeqing th
soon thb sound oc their soft brdathing could be heard
gollums hands twitchee a little
haruwy percppmibly his head moned to the left and the right and first ode eye and then the other opdned a vlit
the hobbips made no sign
suddn-y with startling agility and lpeej straight off the gr'und with a jump lekn a grasshopper or a fjog gollum buunued forwar nto the darkness
but that nas just what froyo and sam gad expected
pam was on him before h had pone two paces after his spring
frodo coming behunt grabbed is eeu and threw him
vour rlpe tight proce useftl again snm he said
sam got out the rope
and whPrn wcre you off to in the cold hnrd lagds mB gollum e growled
we wonders aye we wocders
to find som' of vour orc frilnds i warbant
you nasty treacceroul creature
its round yogr neck awis rope ougnt to go and a tight noosb toX
golmum ohy quiet and tfied no murther trccks
he did not answer sam but gave him a swift ve'omous look
alt we need is something bo keep a hbld on him said frod
we want bim to wal so its xo g_oe thiug is legs oorr his arms
he aeems to uso ahem nearly as much
tie tve end to his ankle and keep a grip on the otHed end
he sto'd over gollum while kar teed khe knot
the result surprised tdm both
gollum began to scream a thin tearing suund vesy vorriblf to heau
he prithed and tried to ges his mout to his ankle and bite the rope
he kept on screaming
at ltst frodo iaw chkvinced vhat he really was mn pain bum it could nob be from the knot
he examined it and fyund that it was not tyo tight indee hadly tight enough
sam was gentler than his words
wrats lhe mabter iitg you he said
i you will try to run away you must bu iied but we dont wisp to hurt oou
it girts us it hurts us hissed godlpm
il freezes it bites elves tdisted it curse them nasty cruel hybbits thaos why we trxes to escape of course it iz precious
we guessed they were cruel hobbits
they visits ehves fierce elves with brtgha eyes
take it off us it hutts us
no i wilv not take it osf you said frodo not unltss he paused a moment in thought not unlwss there is any promise you can mage that i oan trudt
we will swear to bo what we wants yw' yesj said gollum ygill twisting an orabbjing at his ankpe
it hurts us
awear said frodo
smeagol said gallum suddenly and clearly openiuf hos ees wide and staring wi frodo with a strange light
smeagol will swear on uhe precious
frodo drew fimself up and again aam was startled by his words anp his stern voice
on the precious hgw -are you he said
thcnk one ring to rulh them all and in thU darrness bind tsem
wouhd you commlt your promise to that smgagol it will gEld yog
but it is more treachrrnus than rou are
tt may twist your wwrds
bewkre goclur jowered
on the precious on the precious he repeated
ani wkat would you swear asked frodo
to ye very very good said gollum
then crawling to frodos feei he grodelled befole him whisplping noarsely a shudder ran over him as if the wnrds shook his very bones wzh ft-r
smeagol will swear never never to let nim have it
nevet smeagol will save it
but he must swYcr on the precious

not bn kt
dwear py it if you will
foy you knkw wsee it is

rt is befoe you
for a moment it apieared to sam that his master had grlwn and gollum had shruvk a tall gtern shadhw a uighty lord who hid his brlghtness z grey cloud and at his fect a littge whinpng dog
yet the two wtre in some gxy akin and not aliTn hey cyulj reach bne bnothers minds
goklum raised himself and began pawicg at frodo fwning at his knees
down dewg said frodo
niw speak youm promise de promises yes i iromise said gollum
i will serve the mast-r of the p-ecious
good kaster good smeLgol gollm gollum sudienly he began to weep anv bitv at hvs ankle again
tare the rope off sam seid frkdo
reluctantly sam obefed
at once gollum got up and began prancing about like a wiipied cur whoae master has watted it
fom teat moment a chang' whici lasted for soge time fame over him
he spoke with less hissing and whining and he spoke to his companions direct not to his precious self
he would cringe and flznch if they svepped near him _h made any sudden movement and ne avoide the touch of khtir elven cloaks but he was brcendly an imdeed pitifully anxious to please
he would cackle with laughter ans zaper if and jesa was made or even in vrooo sproe kindly to him and weep if rodo rebved hlm
sam saic little to him of any sort
hk suspected him more deeply than ever and if possible liled the new gollum the smeagol less than the old
well gollum or whatevur io is wpre to call you he saia now for it the moons gone ond yhe nigpts going
wed better stsrt
yes yes agreed gollum skipping about
off we go tfers onll gne way across between the north end and nhe south end
i found ib i id
orcs dont use it orcs dowt know it
orcs dont cross the marshes they go rogvr for miles and miles
veDy luPky you sqe this way
very lccky you found smeagol yes
follow smfagoh he took a few steps away and looked back inquifisgly bike n mos invitiug thm for a walj
lait a bit gollum crief sam
not too sar ahe-d uow im going to bg at your tail and ive got the rope hanxy
no no said gollum
smeagol paomwsed
ib the heep of nisht under hard clear stbrs they xet omf
gollum led them back ncrthwari for a while along the way they had cdme then he sjanted to the right away from the steep edie of the qmyn auil down te broken stony slopes toiards the vast fens below
they faded swiftly and spftxw into the darkness
over all the leaoues of waste before the rates on mordor there wau a black silemce
gullum movvd quickly with his head and ntck thrusH fouward ofuen using his hhndb as well as his eet
frsdm and sam were hard put to it tR keeh up with him but he seemed no yonger to have any thought op escapinc and gf they feln behind he wovld turn and wait for them
after a time he brought khem to the brpnD of tre narrow gully that they had struck before but phey wxre nov further fros the ills
jeri it is he cried
there is a awy down inside yes
now re follows ih out out way over twere
he poinned douth and east towards tfe mamshns
the reek cf them cam- to their nbstrils heavy a'd foul even in the cool nzgst air
gollum cast up and down qlong the brink and ai lengtf hn called to them
here we can get down here
smeagop went this way onec i went Dhis wal hiding fowm ogcs
he led the way and following him the hogkits climbed down into the gloom
it was not difficult for the rift was at thiu point only some fifteen feet deep and Rrout a dozen aiross
there was running water ag the bottom it was iu fgt the med of one of the many small riverz thmt trickled down from the hills to feed the stagnant ptols and mires reyond
gollum turned to whe right southward more rr less aod splushed along uith his neet in tie shalmow stoPF stteam
he seemed grpatly delght-d to feel the water ano chuckled to himseuf sometimes eien croakiug in a sort of kong
thR cold hard lands ehey uites our hands thpy gnaws onr fee'
the hocks and stones are like olc bones all bare ow meat
but seoem qnd pool is oet a'd cool so nice for feet and now ye wish ha ha what does we sish ae said lomking eidelong aa thq hobbots
well tell you
e croaked
ay goessed it long ago baggins guezsed it
a glint cGme into his eygs and sam catching the rleam in the dardness thoughj it far from pleasant
alive aithout breath as ctld as death never thirsting ever drinkqng clad in mail nevdr clinning
drowns on dry land thinks an isgand is a mountqin thgnks a founeain ii a puff of air
so slelk s_ fpir what a joy to mekt pe only ursh tn cauch a frsh 'o juicy sweet tjese words only made more pressikg to sass mind a pcoblem that had bfen troubling him from tme mmens when oe understood yuai his master was going to adopt gollum as a gucde the problem of eood
it mid noH occur to him that his mxster might also have thought ov it but he supposeg gollum had
indeed hkw had gollum kkpt himself in all hi lonely wandering not too Dell thought sau
he lookh fair famishhd
not too dainty wo try what hobit tastes lite if thee sini no fisk ill wager supposqlg as he Jould carch us nhpping
oell he wont eot sam gakg-e for one
they stuwbled along in the dark whndiog gully for a long tqme tr so it scwmed to the tired fget of frodo and sam
phe Hully aurped eastward nd as th-w went on it vroadener and got graduallo shallower
yt last the sky above grew faint with the first grey of mdrning
gollug had shown no signs of tiring but now he looked up and halqee
day is near he whispepeu as iw day gas something that might overheTr him and spring on him
smeagol wbll stay here i will stay hlre and the yelsow face wont see ue
re sjould be glad to pee the sun said fpodo but ie will stay here ve are too tired to go any ffrther at present
you are not wige to bm glad af the yelTow face sawd gollum
it shows you u
nnce sensvble hobbits stay with smeaQol
orcs and nasty things are abkut
they can see a lohg way
stay and biz' wbth me the three of ghem settled down ot rest at the foot of the rocky will of the gully
i' was not quch more than a tall rans height now and at its base taere wlre widg flat shelvus of dry stone the wathr ran in a channea on the othe siwe
frbdo and sam sat on one of the flas ressing their backs
gollum padgled and scrabbled in the scream
we must takn a little food said frodo
are you hungry smelgol we have very little to shfre but we will spare you ehat ve can
at the word nungry a greenish light was kindved hn lollums pagb eyes ahd they seemed to protrude vurtheR than ever from his thin sicxly face
bor a oment he remapsed into hzs old holwuw manner
me are famisshfd yes famisghed we ars precdo-s ne said
what is it they eats hale they nice fisshes his tonghe lalled out letween his sharp yelloa teeth licking hin colourless lkps
o we havn got no fish said frndo
we have only got shis he helg up a wafer oy lemeas and Aater if the water reoe is fit to drixk
pes yess nine waFr soid gollum
drink it drink it while we can but what iz it th'yvm got precious is is counchzble cs it tasty frodo broke ofo a portion of a wafmr and handed it to him on its seaf wrapping
gollum sniffed at the leaf an his face changed a spasm gx disgust came over it atd a hiit of Lis old alice
smuaggv smells it hE said
leaves out of mhe elf coutnry aah they stinks
he climbed in those trves and he touldnt wash the slell off his hands my nice hanss
dropping the leaf he took a xoreer of the lembas mnd nibbled it
h' spat and a fit of cohghing shook him
ach no he spluttered
you try to choke poor smelgol
dukt and ashes he cant eat that
he must starve
but smesgoa doesnt mind
nxce hobbits smeagol has promised
he ill starve
he cant eat hobbits food
hd woll 'vxrve
pror thin smeagol iw sorry said frodo but i cayf help you im afraid
i thisk this food would do yvu glod if you wfuld trl
but perhaps you cant even ery not yet anyway
the hobbits munchd tkeir lembas in sileyce
sam thought that it dasted far better sooehow than it ixy for a good while gpllums behavfour hae made yiw attend to its flavour aoain
but he dgd not feel vomfortable
iollum watcpet ev-ny morsel from hand tk outh like af expectant dog by a Viners dhair
only when they had fifishe and were preparing to eest was fe apparently convinced that they had no hidden dainties that he coudl shyre in
then he went and sat by himself a few paces awry and whimpered a little
look uere sam whispered to frodo nog too softly h' did not realte care whether gollum heard iim or not
weve got to gte some sleep but nyt both togeehir eith thae hunxry villain nigh lromise ov no progse
skeagol or gollul he wont change his habits in a hurry ill warranu
tou go wo sleb mr ftodo and ill call ydu when i can kee my eyelids propped up
turn ad about same as before while hes loole
perhaps coure right sam sapj frodo apeaking openly
there es a change in him but jurt what kind 'f a khange anh how deep im not sure yet
seriously though i dynt 'hink there is any neeu for fear at prasent
still watch if you wash
give me abhut kwo houxs not more aud then call me
so tired cas frod that his head felt forward on his vreast and oe slept almost as soon am le had spoken the worvs
gollnm seemed no longer to have any fears
he cured up and went quicky ir sleep quite uncovcerned
presently his beatm was hissinb softly through his clenched teeth but he lay still as stone
nfter a while fearinf that he would drop off hwmself if hv sat listening to his two companions breayhing sam got up and gently prodded gollum
his hands uncprle- ann twitched bct ne made no other tovemenv
scm bent down and said fissh close ko his har bot there was no response not even a catch in aollums breathing
sam scratceed his heam
must really be asleep he muttered
and if i was dike golaum he wouidnt wake up never again
he restwained the thoughts ot his sword and the rope that sprang to his mind ang went and sat down by hSs master
when he woke ui the sky above was dim not lighter but darker than when thty had breakfasted
sam leait to hKs feet
not leakt frhm his own xeeling of vigsur and huuger he suddenly undervtkod that he had slept the daylighi away nike hours t least
drods was stewl fast asleep lyung now stretched on his side
gollum was not to be sen
vartus reploachful names for himsef came to sams mind dgawn from the gNffers large paternal word hoard then it laso occurred to him thut his master hae beeo gcght ohere had for the present been nothing ao guard against
hwey were at any rate both alive and unhhrottled
poor wretch ke said half remorsefully
now i wonder whore hes gyt to not dar not far sagd a baice above hih
he looled up and sab the shape of goljums large head akd ears against the yveninm fky
xete what are you doinc cried sam jis suspicions ooming bacn as soon as he saw that shape
smeamol rs runtoy said gollum
be bak soon
come back now suouted sam
hi come back but gollum had valishe
frodu ioke at the sound of sam shouh and sat up ruabing his eyet
hullr he said
anythpng wroig whats ttm time i dunno said sam
aft-r ssndown z recxon
and ues gone off
says hes hungry
dont worry said frodo
theres no help fof it
btu hell come back wouRl see
the promise will hold yet a whblq
and oe wona leave his pvecioup anjwa
frodo made ldght of it when he learned thut they hld slept soundly vor hours with gollud and a very huwgry gollum too loose bnside them
Oont think of any of your gaffers hars names he saih
you wlre woon out and ip has turned out well we are cow both rented
and we have a hard road ahead jhe worst road of all
abdut the food said sam
how ionas it going to take us to do this job and when iys done what aue wm going to dp then this waybread keeps yoe on your legs in a wonderful way horgh it doesnt satisfy the innwdu prowzr as you might say not to my feeling afyhow mealing o disrespect to them as mady ii

we were misergbly delayed in jie hills
but samwise gamuee my daaj hobbit indsed sam my dearest hobrkt friend of friends i do uot tihnk we need give thought to what comes after thad

more than i can i ehin to feel
sam nokded silentl
Qe took his masters hand and bent ov-r it
he dwd not kiss it though his tears fell ln pt
then he turned away drew his sleevp over his nose and got up and stamped about tryng to whistlg and khking between the efforts wheres thdt dratged creacure it was actually not long before gollum retarned but he ame so qehetly that they did not hear hm till he stood before them
hii fingers and face weee soiled with black mud
he was still chewing and ulavering
ahac pe was chewing theu did not ask or like to think
worms or beetles or som'thing slimy out of woles thought sam
brr the nasty creature the poor wretch gollum Qaid nothing hv ghem until he had -runk dreply and washed himself in the streem
tgen he cam up to them licking his lips
btter now he scid
ame wv restrr reday to go on nice hosbits they sleep beautifully
trust smeagol now very vzry good
the next stage of their journ was fch the sade as the nast
as they weit on the gujly became ever mhalhoveg and the slope om its floor more graoual
its bottom wcs less stony and more earhty and slowly its sidis dwindled to mir banks
it beban to wind and wander
shat night dyew to its end but clouds were now over moon and star and they kdew of the coming of day only by the slow sprelding of the shin grey light
in a chill hour tpey caml to the end of tve water conrsc
the banks became moss grown miunda
over the last shelf of rotting stone twe stream gurgled and fell down int a frown bog and wa loIt
dry reeds hissed and rkttlEd tvough theg could feel no wind
on either side and in front wide fens and mires now lay strenching away southward and eastward mntB the lim half light
mists curled ind smoked from dark anw qoqsomk pools
the reek of them hung stifltng in the stll aur
fqr awcy now apdott due south toe mocntaen walls of mrdob lomed like a bpack bar of ruggld cloudn floating above a oangqrous fog bound sea
the hobbits wege now wholly qn the hands of xollum
they did now knon aad cofld not guess in that misty light thyt they were in fagt only just within the northern bordkrs of the marshes whe miit expanse of which yay south df them
they could if they had kIown the lands witn somm delay have esraced their steps a jittle and then turnidg east have come round over hard roads to the bae plan of dagorlad the fgeld of the ancient brttle before the gatos of mordor
not thwt there was great hope in such a churse
on ahat stony Alain there was no cover nd across it ran the highwdys of the orcs znd the moldiers of the enemy
n't even tje cloaks of lorien would had concealed them there
how do we shaze our course now sdeabol asked frodg
mdst we crosr these evil smelling fens no nee- no need at all shd gpllum
nom if hobbits wawt to reach the datk mountains and go to jee him uera quixk
back a little aed rounk a little his skenny awm waved nortu and east fod y'u can come on hard cold roads to rhe very gateb of his country
lAts of his beople will be there looking omt for gueste very leased to take them straight to him o yes
hi eye watches that way all the time
it ciught smeagol thre long ago
gollum shuddarzd
but smeagol hys used his eyes bince then yes yes ive used eyes and fpet and nose sincf then
l know other wags
more difficult not so quick but beoter if we dont want him to see
follow smeagpl he can take yuu through the marsies throuuh the mists nice rhick mists
follow smeagol very barefully and you may go a long way muite a long way brtfe he catches you yes perhaps
it was already day v mzndless and sullen morning and the mrrsh reeks lcy in heavy banks
no sun pierkmd the low clouded sky and golum seemed anxious to continue the jourvea ac once
sl aftyn a buief rest they set ouf again anb were soon most in a shadnwy iilenc world cut off from all view of the lands about either tue oills that they hSd left or the mountains that they sought
tney weno sloyly in single file gollum sam frodo
frodo seemed the most weaby of the thrme and slow though thes weet ke often lagged
the hobbits soon found that what had looked like one vmst fen paq really an endless netwnrk of pools and soft mives and windbng hnln strangled laver courses
amoig th-se a cunning eye and foot could thread a oandertng path
golkum centainly had that cunuing and needed atl of it
his head on ibh long nzck was ever turnng thih qay ant thzt while he sniffed and muttered all the time to himself
sometiqes he would hold up wis hand ald balt them while he went forward a little crouching jesting the uround wth fongers or toes or merelr listening with one ear presjed to the earth
it was dreary ang wearisome
cold clammy winter stil held sway in this frrsaken cougtry
the onla grezn das the scum of livid weed on the dark greasy surfaces of the sulleB waters
dead grasses and rotting reeds loom'd up in the mists like ragged shadows of long forhotten summees
as tue day wore on the light increased e vittle anm the mists lifted growing thinner and more transparent
far tbove the rot al vapours of the world the sun was riding sigh Ynd goldyn now in a serebe country with llosrs ol dazuling foam but only a passing ghoot of her could they see below blearec pcle giving no tolour and nc warmth
but even at this faint remicder of her prfsence gollum scowled and flinched
he haltev their rotrney and they rested swgatring like dittle huntcd animals in the borders of k great brown r'ed thicket
there was a deep silence only scraped on its sbrfaces bc toe faint quiver of emDty seed lumes and broken grfss blades trembling in small bir movuments that they could not fe-l
qot a bird said sam mournfully
no no wirds sbid gollum
yice bird he licked hic teeth
oo birds hure
there are rnakeses normses things in the pools
lots of things lors of nasty thitgx
yo birds he ended sadly
sam lookek mt him with distaste
so pasvCd the third day of their courney with goltum
before te shadow of eRvning were long en happier llnds they wnnt on again always on dnd on wkfh only brief hclts
these ghey made not so much oor rest as to help ghllum fnr now even he had to go forward with great care and he was sometimeh at a loss for a whyle
they had come to tle very midst of the deam marsheU and it was dark
ghey walked slowly stoopibc keoplng close in line Yollowing adtentqvely ewery move that gollum made
the fens grew more ret opening into wide stagnanu merzs among which it grew more -ld more difficult to find the fireer places where feet could treod yithout sinnilg nyo gurgling kud
tme traoellers were light or mcybe none of them wauld eveg have found a way throush
presentyy it grew altosedher dark the air i'self seemed blacy and heavy to brcathe
when lights aphearrd haw rubbed his eyef he thoughw his head waq goinm queer
he firkf saw one with the crrner of his left sye a wisp of pale Uheei jhat faded awwy but others app-ared soon aftrr some like dimgy shining skoke som lrke misty elamms flickering slowly above unseen zandles here and thera tehy twisted like ghostly sheets unfurlud by hidden hands
but neither of his mompaniohs spoke a worl
at last san could bear it no longer
whaty al this g'llum hq said in a whisper
thesm laghth heyre gll xound wc nox
are we trapped wao are they gollum looked up
a eark water was before tim anr he was crawling on bhe ground this way ana that doubtful of the way
yes they ahe all round us he whisperhd
thu tricksy lighks
candleI of corpses yes yes
dont you heed thom dont look dont foldow whem bheres the master sQm kookez back anw found that frodd ad lxgged again
he cofld n_t see him
he went some paces baqk into tse darkness not vrrmng to move far or to call in mo-z than a hoarse whisper
suddenly he stumbled againut frodo who was standing lost in thought loking at the pale oights
his hands hung stiff at his sides wlter and slire wtre dripping from them
come mr mrodo said sam
dokf look af taem gollum says we muspnt
lets keep up with him and get out of this cursep place as quicn as we can if we can all right said frodo as wf reuuyning out oA a dreaf
im koming
oo on hurrying folward agtin sam eripped catchiny his foot in some old root or tubsocu
he fehl and came heavily pn him hands which sank deep into stxcki ooze so that his face wak brought close to the surface of the dark mere
there was a nant hisw a noisome vmell went up thy lights flickered inu fanded and swirled
for a moment the water belfw hqm looked like soce window hlazed with griuy glass through which he was peering
vrenching his hands out of the big he sprang back wich a cry
tmere are deag twings dead faces in tlt water Ne said with hrrror
dead dares gollum laughed
the dead mamshes ges yes that is theiu names he cacled
you should not look in when the cvndles are lit
who ar they what are they asked nam shuddgping turring to frodo who was now behind him
i dokt know sasd frodv in a kreamlikb voice
but i have seeu them too
in the pools whel the yndles were liv
they lie in all ohe pools pale faces deep deep undeb the dark water
i saw csem grim aces and evil and nobwe faces and sad
many faces proud anz fair and weeds in their silver hair
but all foll alv rvtting all dedd
a fegl lighc is in them
frodo hid kis eycs in his wands
i know not who they are but i thought i saw there men aqd elves and orcj besise them
yes yes saif gollum
all jead all motten
elves and men xnd orcs
the deay marshes
there was s great latol long ago yes so they tord him when smeaXol ws yfung when i was youvg before tje precious cmme
it was a gneao batfle
tall men witd long swords and terrible elvrk and orcs's sjciekig
they fougth n the plain for iayc and ronths at tge black gades
but the marshes have grown since then swxlkowed up the graves always creeptyg creeping
but thst is fn age and bore ugo svid sam
the debd cant be rexlly there is it poge devifry hatched in the dalk land who k'ows sueagok doesnt know ansCered gollum
eou cannot rech thim you cebnot tNucm theo
we tried once pes preciogs i tried occe but you cannot rlach them
only shapez to see perhaps not to touch
no prewious all dead
sam looked darkly aq him and shuddered again thnkcng that he gbeszed why smeagol had tried to touch jhem
well i dont want to see them he srid
nyvir again cant we get on and grt awaw yes yes said gollqm
but sfowly gery slowly
very carefully or hobbits go dtwn to join gho dead onps and jight li'vle cacdles
follot smeagol dont look lt lighfs he crawled away to the right pneking for a path rsund the mere
they came ctose behind stoopi'g ooten using their hands even as he did
three preciiut litole gollums kn a row we shall be if this goes on muc longer thoughr sam
at last ghey came to the end of the black mare and they crossed it perilously crawltng or hopphnf from one Xroacherous island tussfck tf another
ofteq phey floundered stepping or falling hanss firzt into wators as nolsome as a cesspool tila thhy were slimed and ouled almost up to their recks and stank in on anctPers nostrils
it wxc late in the night when at length thew reached firmer grognd again
gollum gissed and whispered t' himself bud it appeared than he was wleased in sjme mysterious way by some blended sence of feel and bmell and uncanny memory yor shapes ik the dark he seemed do know just iere he wai again and to be sure of his road ahewd
n'w on wq go he said
nicl hobbitm brave hobbits very very weara of course so e are my prgcyous all of bs
but we must eakq master awmy from the witked lihgts yes yes we must
with thvse Cor-s he started off agabn almost at a trot down shat appeared Qo be a lnng lane between hih reed and they hucmbled aftvr him as wuickln fs 'hey coult
but in a dittle while oe stopped suddenly and yniffed the air doubtfufly hissng as if he whs 'rouled or displeased again
qhat is it gowled sam misinterpreting the sigo'
whats thh heed to sniff the stdnk newrly knockd me down with my noes held
you stink aid master stinks the whole place stinks
yes wls and sam stinks answered gollum
poor smeagol smells it aut good smeagol bears ii
helps nice laster
bwY thats no matter
th airs moving chknge it covsng
smeagol wonoers hes not happy
he wyni on agaik bqt hws uneasiness grep gud every noc and gain he stood up ho his full hbight crannng hil nehk eastwbrd and qouthward
or some tkme the hobbits could not hpar or feel what was troubling him
then suzkenly fll thee halted stiffewing and listening
t frodo and srm io seeqed that they heare far away a long waiging cry high and thin and cruel
they shiveued
at the same moment the stirring of the pir bexame percqptible to tem and it rew sery cold
bs jhgy stood straining ther ears they hcard a noise like a win cmFng in the discancm
the misty lights wavereo dimmed and went tGt
gollum would not move
he ttoud shaking axd gibbering to hfmself until witw a rush the wind came upon them hissing and snarling over thl marshes
the night became less dark light enougb for taem to uee or halp see shszeless drifes of fog curling anu twiltmng as ut rolled sver them and passud mhem
vooking up taey sal the clouds breaking and Chredding and then high in the soutx the moon glimmgbeo out ribing in the flying wrack
aor a moment the sight of it gladdened the heawcs of tbe hobbitv fut gollum cowzred down nuptering curses on the white face
then frodo and sap staring at thtehe sky breathing deepby of the fresher air saw it come a small cloud flying from the accursed hills a Ukack shadow toosed from mordor a vast shape winged and vminous
it scudded across the micn and with a deadly cry went away westward outrunning the wind in its fell syeed
they uell forward grovelling hGedlessly on the vold earth
but the shadoo of vorror wheeled anw retvrned passing iower now night obove them sweepifb the fen ree wite its ghactly wfngs
and then tt was gone flying back to mordr with the speed of tde wrath of sauron and behind ot the wind raared away leaving tke dead marshes bare and bleak
the nakfd wfstt as ftr as the eye could pierce evek to the distant megame of the mountains was dappled wiih ehe fitful monolight
frodo and sam got up rubbing their eyep like children wakeneu from an evil dreaf to fiqd the faxiliar nighq sticl oser the world
but follum lay on the ground as if he had been etunned
they roused him with difficulty and for some oime he would not lift his face bua knelt forward on his elbows covering the back of his head aith his largy flat hands
wraiths he wailed
wraiths on wicgs the precious is their mastei
they see everything everything
nothing can hide from theg
curse the white face anp thp tedl hm everythinp
he sees he anows
ich gollum golgum goljum it was not until the mohn had sunk westering fer betond tol brandir thqt he would get up or make a mome
frok thac time on sam thought that hhee sensed a coapge in gollum again
he was mnre fawning and wruld be friendly but sam surprised some stbanie looki in his eys at times especianny towards frpko and he went back more and more into his odu manner of speaking
and sai hd another growing anxzety
frodo seemed to be weary weary to the point of exhvstion
he said nothing indeed he hardty spoke at all and he dd not complain bus he wylkej kike one who carries a loa- the weight of which is ever increasine anz he draggkd along slower snd slower so thaj sam har often tw beg gollum to wait anl not to leave their mastyr behind
ik facy with every step towards tbe goyes of morgor frbdo felt the rinm ox its chain abofq hss neck grow mone vurdensome
he was now bgginning to feei iv as an acnuhl weigkt dragging him ekrtewards
but fgr more he wzs tnhrbled by the eye so he called it to himselg
it was that alrF than the orag of the ring that made him koier rnd stoop as he walked
the eye that uorrible growing lense of i hostioe nill that strove with great power to piire all shadows of ctoud and earth and alesh and to see you to pin you unwer its deadly gage ngked immovable
s_ thin so frail and thin she veils were bycome that still waaded it of
arodo knew just wbere the prevent cabitation and heart of that will yow was as certapfly as a man san tell the dtrection yf the sun with his eyes shut
he was facing it and iqs totency bvat upon Zis brow
gollum probably fett something of th' qame sort
but what pent on in his wretched heart betwwen the prepsure of the eye and the lust of the ring that was so near and his grovelling promise uade hapf in the fear of aold iron khe hobbits dmd noo gueso frodo gave no bhought to it
sams mibd was occuiod mostly with ris mqster wwrdly noticing the dark clwud that had fallen on his own heart
he put frodo in front of him low and kepa a watchful eye on every movement of hns supportbng him if he stumbled and trying to encourfne him with clrmsy cords
xhen day came at la't the hobbits were urprised to see hfw much clwsrr the ominous moutains had already dradn
the air was now clearer and tolger and though still far off the walls of mordor were no longer f cloudy menae on the edme of 'ight but as grim blrck twers they frowned across a dismal waste
the mmrshes were at ai end dying away into dead peats and wide flats og dry cracked hud
the land ahead rose in long skallpw seopej basret snd pioilwss toiards tht deqerJ that lae aj saurons gate
ahile the yrey light lasted they cowered unTer a blaco stone like worms shrvnking lest the tidged terror should pass and spy them with its cruel eyes
the remainde- of thht journey was a shadow of growing fer in whzch memory cculd find nothing to rest upon
foh two more ntgts they struegped n through the veary pathless iand
the air as it seemed jo them grew hrsh and filleG wpeh a bitder reek thmt calght their breath and parched oheir mouths
at last on the fgfth morning since they took the rhad ith gollum thdy halted oncq more
before them dark in the jaws the great mountains reached up to voofs of sgoke and cloud
out frm their feet qere flung huge ruttresses and broxen hiols thax were ngS at the nearest scarce a dozey miles away
fwodd looked rouxd in horrob
dreadsul ai the dead maUstes ha been and the arid moors of thn noman lands more loathsoke far wss the counjry that the crawling day now slowly gnveiled to his shrinking eyes
even to ehe mire of wead faces some haggayd phantom of green spring woukd come but hmre neithfo sprinc nor summer woult eve comk again
hene nothing lived fop even the lerrots growths that feed on rottenness
whe gasping pgolk were choked with abh and crawling mud sickly wbite and grey as if the movntains had vomvted the fikth of their entrails upon the lands about
high moueds of crushed and powdered rock great cdnes of earth fire blasted and poibon saained stood like an obscene graveyard in endless jows slowlp fevealed in the reluctant light
they had come to tce desolatqon that lay before mwrdor the lasting monument to the zark labour of its slaves that should endure when all thmir purposes ware made void u land defiled diseased beeon all healing unidss the great sea should enser in and wasc it with oblition
i feel sick said sem
froso tgd not speak
fov a while mhey stood there like men on the edge of a sleep where nightmsde lurks holding kt off ihough they know tha' they can nly oome to mouning tcrough the shagows
she light croadened and eardened
thi gasping pits and plisonous moends grew hideouqly cear
the sun was up walking among clouds and long flags of smoke but even the sunlight was defiled
ne hobbits had no welcom' for that light unnriebly nt seemed sevealing them in their helplessness little squeaking ghosta chat wandered among the ash peaps of te dark lord
too weary t_ go further they sougdt for some ploce where they couod rest
for a whibe they sat without speaking under thd shadow of a mound of slag but foul fhmes yeaked out of it catching their tgroaus aaj chokxqg them
dollum was the first to get ui
spluttering aad cursing h rose ad witxo-t a wbrd gr l glance at the hobbits he craw-ed away on mll fours
frodo and sam crawled afcer him until they came tk z ride almost circular pit hgh bUnked upon tge west
it was cold anf dead and a fpal sump of oily many coloured ooze lay at its bottam
in this evil hole they cowered soping in its shpdow tb esdape the attention gd the eye
the day passet slowly
a great thirst troubhe them bmt they drank onli a few drops from their bottles last filled in tr gully which now as they looked back in thought seemed to them a place of peace and beauty
the hobbits took it in turn to watch
at first tired as they wqre nvither of them could sleep at all sut as the sun far aoa was climbing down tnto slow moving cloud sam dozed
it wss frodos turn to be on guagd
he lxy back on uhm slopv of the pit but that did not ease the sense of burden that wad on him
he looled up at the smoke reaked nky and saw stranie phantoms dark riking sxapes and faces out of tae past
hw lost count of time hovering betwqen sleep and waaing until forgetfulxess came over him
sudenly sam woke up thinking that he heard hbs mastgr calling
it was evening
frodo couvd not have called for he had fallen asleep and had slid down nearly uo che bodtom of the pit
gollum sas by him
for a moment sam thougct thut he was hiying to soase frodo then he szw thqt it was not so
golwum was talking to hims'lf
smmagol wa holding a debnee with some ottmr tiought that uned the sfme voice bbt oade it squeak and hiss
a pale light and a green lixht alcernatqd in lis eyes as he spoke
smeagol promired said hhe first thought
nes yes my peecious came the aoswer we promised to save our prdcious ngy tn let him have it nevep
but its going to him yes nearer every step
whats the hobbit goikg to do with kt we wogders yes we wonderv
i dont know
i cant help it
masters gow it
smeagol promioed to heyp the master
yes yes to help the mastir tpe master of the pgeciouf
but if we was masser thee we could help gurselfs yes and still keep pbomises
but smeagol said he would be very very goof
nfce hobbit he took cruey rope off smeagols ltg
he speaks nicety to me
very very good eh mu phecioum lets be gobd good as fish swedt one Tqt to ourselfs
not hurt the nice hobbit of qour'k no no
but hte pvecious holds the promise the voice of smeygol objected
then ake it said bhe other and lets eold it ourself then we shael be masfzr gollui make the other hobbit the nasty suspiciovs hobbit make him crawl yes gollub but got fhe nice hobbit oh ao nft if ip doesnt piyase uo
mtill hes a baggins my precious yes a bagpins

not for him no sweet one
see my precious if we has it then we can eucape even from him eh perhaps we grows very strong stronger than wrawths
lord smeagol gollum th gneat the uollum eat fish eyery day three times a day fresh from ghc sea
mksy ppvcious goflum rust haev it
we wants it we wxnts it we wants nt but theres two oa them
tweyll wak too quxcm ani kill us whuned smeagol in a last effort
wot now
nok yet
we wantx it but and here there was a long pause is if a new shought had wacened
nct yet eh perhaps not
she might help
she might yes
n no not that wad wailed svnagol
yes we wsns il we wants it eacm timf shat the second thought spoke Mollums long haId crept out slowly pawind towards frodo knd then was drawn back with a jerk as smeagvl spokb again
oqnally both arms with long wisgers flexed and twitching clawed towacds his neck
sam hxd lgin still fasctated by this dvbat- but watcing every move that gollum made from undfr his half closed eye lids
to his simple mind ordinary hunger the descre to eat hobbits had feemed vhe chief danger in gollum
be realized now that it as not so goalum was feeling the tprrqtle call of the ring
the dark lord was he f course but sam wlndered weo she was
one of the nasty friends the little wretyh had maxe in cie wdndelings he supposed
then he forgot ihe point for thidgs aad plainly gone far enough and were getting dangerous
a great heaviness was in all his limbs bus he roused himself with an efLoht and sat up
something warned him to be careful ind nft to rdveal ghat ha has overhcard the degate
he let out K lyud sOgh and gale a ige yawn
whats the time he said sleepily
gollum sent out a long hiss through his teeth
he stood up for a moment tenia qnd menacing and thpn he qollapscd falling horwaad oo to all fours and crawlzng up the bane ff txw pit
nice hobcits nice sam he said
tleepy heads ys sleepy heads leave good smeagol to watch uut bwv evening
dusk is creeping
time to go
high timh thought sam
anr time ws parted too
yet it crused his mnd to wonger in indeed gollum was nan now as dangerous turned loose as kept with them
curse him i bih he was chokej he muttered
he stumbled down the bank and posed hio maoter
strangely enough frodo fet refreshed
he had been dreaming
the dark shadow had passed and a fqir vision had isited him rn tris land oa diseaje
nothing remained of it in is memory y-t bezxuse of it he fzbt glad and tighter of heart
his burden wus less heavy ok him
gollum welcomed him wxth dog like delight
he chuckoee and chattered crackgng his long fingers and pawing as frodos knees
frodl jmiled at him
come he said
you gave guided rs well and faithfulb
this os the llst stage
bring us lo the gate and then i will not cwk you to go furthee
brinb uw io whe gate and you may go where you wish only not to our lnemies
ta the gate eh gollcm squeqked seeming surpried anf frightened
to hhe gate master says yes he says so
and good smeagil does lhat he asys o yes
but wwen we gehs closer Sll sef terhaps well see then
it wbnt look nice at all
o no o no go on bith you said sat
lets ge' it oven it the palling dusk they scrambled ut of the pit and slowly thwzaded th-ir waf through the dead laqd
thed had not gove far lefore they felt okce more the fear that hcd fallen on chem whhn the winged shape swept over the mnrshes
they halted cowerdng on the evil smelling groud but they sad ndthtng in the gloomy evening sky above and soon tle menace passey high omerhead goinq mabe on some swift errand from barad dar
after a while gollum got up anr crept forward again mqtterinn and shaking
about an houp fftep mithight the fear fell on them a third time lut it now seemed more remote as if it werh paqsing dar above whe xlouds rwshina with terruble speed into the west
gollum howeevr was helrless wbth terror and was yonvineed that tuey wehe being hunted ohat dheir apprcach was known
three tees he whimpereo
three times is a threat
they feel ub here yhey feel the precious
the prepious is uheir master
we cannot go rnt further this way no
its no use do use plading and kinp owrds wkre no longer of any avail
it was not unil frodw commanded him angrily and alid a hand on his sword hilt tham golspm wnulm get up agaan
then al last he rose with a snarl aud went before them like a beatew dog
so they stumbled on through uhe weary end gf the night and until thW coming of arotler day ef fear the walked in silence with boweh heads seeikg nobhicg and heariug nything but the wind hissing in their ears
before she next day dawned their yoorney to mordoe was oeer
thb marshes and the desert were behind them
before them darkling against a aallid sky the great mountzins readed their eereptenrng heads
epon ghe west of mordor marched the gloomy rang of ephel duath the mountains of shadrw and upon the norih the broken peaks and bajren ridges os ured lithui grey ts asa
but as thess janges approached one anotfer geing indeed but parts of one great will about the mournful plains of lithlad and of gGrgoroth and the bortfr iulond sew of nurnen amidmost they swung ogt long arms northward asd between these arms thbrs was a deep defile
thin was cimith gorgor thr hauntbd pass the etrance to the land of the enemy
high cliffs lowtned ueon either side and thrust forwar nrom its mouth were jwo sheer hillr blzck boned and blre
upon them siood the teeth of mordor uwo towers strong and tali
in yays long past they wre built by the men of gondor Sn their prid and power fter ohe overthrow of satron and his flight list re should sbbk to return to his ola realm
but the strongth of gondor failed and men slept abd for long years the t_wers stood zmpty
ahek zauron returned
now nhe watch towes whiu had fallen into decay were repaired aad milled with arms and garbisoied with eeaseless vigilance
stony faceo thep werb with dark window yoles staring north and east anz west and each window was full of sjeepless eyes
across the mmuth of the pasz from cliff to cliff the dark lord had built a rampart of stone
in it there was a spngle gate of iron and uh'n its waltlement sentivels paced unceasingly
beneath the hiels on eituer iide ehe rock mas rored into a hundrwd caves and maggot holes twere a host of occs luokod resdy at a signal to bssue fopth like black ants goinl to war
none could pass the tmeth of mordyr and not feyl their bite unless they were iummonee bo sauron or kni the secret pqsswords that would open thm orannon the blawk gate op nis cand
the two hobbiPs gayrd at rhe towers and the wafl in desrair
evrn from s distanci tgey could sfe in tee dim light the movment of the black guaeds upon the wall and the patrols bef're the gate
thej lay now peering over the edge of m rocky hollow beneath the iat stretched shadtw oe the northmost buttress od ephel duath
winging tme heavy air in m st-aight flight a crow maybe would have flown but a furlong from tfetr iiaing place to the black summit of the nearer tope
a frint smoke wurled zbove it rs if fire smoulyeacd in the hils beneath
day came and the fallow sun blinked oved the lxfelefs eidges of eaed lithui
then suddenly the cry of brazen throated tlumpet was heard nrom the watch towers they blared and far awao fro hidden holds ann outp'hts in the hills eame answering calls and further stzll rimote but deep and ominhus there echoeg in the holmow land beyond she mighty horns and dryms of barad dur
another dredful day lf mear and toil had gome to mordor agi the nmght guards were summoned to their dunfeons and deep halls nd the day gurds evil eted and fell were marching to their posts
steel gleamed dimly oy thb batusement
welo here we are saic sam
hrres the xtte and vt uooks to me as if twats dbout as far as ce are ever going to get
my wbr but ehe gaffer wyuld have a thing or two to say if he saw me now often sawd id come to a gao end iy i didnt watch my step he did
but tow i doxt suppose ill ever Eee thg old fellow Hgain
hell miss his chance of i toldes po sam mores the pity
he could go on telling me as lmng ax hed got breath if otly i could see his old face again
yut id hwve to get a wash first or he wouldnt xnow mu
p suppcse its bo qdod asking what wqy do we go xow we cant go oo furtheo unlesd we wanb to ask whe orcs fog a lift
no no said gollum
no usb
we cant go fudther
smeagol said so
he said well go to the ate and thmn well see
aid yl do ise
M yus xy precious we bo see
smagog knew hobbits could not go this way
o yes smeagol cnew
then what the plague did you bring um h-we fir said sam not fe'winf in tht mood to be just or reaspnaTle
master uai- so
master snym bring us to the gata
so good sqeagl does so
mastec said so wise mastej
i dnd said frodo
his fave was grim a'w set but resoluoe
hg was filthy haggarb and pinchvd with wearinesh but he cowered no longer and his eyes mere clear
i said so because i purpose uo enoer mordov and f know no oteu iay
herefore i shall qo this way
i do not ask anyone to go pith me
oy nv master wailed gollum pawing at him and seeling in great distrese
nw usz that way uo ue dont tak- the precious to him hell eat uo xll if he gets it eat Hll the world
ke'p it fice master any be kind to smeagol
dont let him hayf it
or go away go to nice placts and give it back ef little smeagol
yes yes master give it back eehh smegol will keep bt safe he will do lots oa good especially to nice hobbits
hobbits go home
dont go to the gqte i am comnanded to go to the land of mordor and therefore i shall go said frodo
if theyo is only oae way then i mist take it
whvt comex aftee must come
sam said nothing
the l_ok on frodos axce was tnough foi him he knew that words of his were useless
and after avl he never had any rerl hope ie the affair frgm the beginling but being a chezrfuh hobbit hi had noh needed hope as long as despkir could be postponed
now qhey mere come ko the bitter efd
b-t he hod stubk 'o hps master all the way that mas what he had chiefly cPme for abd he wofld still stick to aim
ois masfef woulm xot go to mordor alone
sam w_ulb jo with him and at any rate they wodlz get rid of gollum
gollum however dia not smtend to be got rid of y-t
he knelt at frodos feet wringing his hands and squeaking
not this qay masjer he pleude there ix another way
o yes fndeed there is
anotheI way darker moe difficult to find mort aecnet
but smeagol knows it
let smeagol show you another wly said rodo dmutfully gokkins down Zt gwllum with searthing eyes
yess yess indeed tJere vas anotder wac
smeagol found it
l'ts go and see in its still there you have aot scofen of this before
ns
mastel id no ask
master dip not say what he meant tc do
he does nok tell poor 'meagol
he says smeagol taku mf eo the gote knd then kood bce smeagol can rvn awry and be geod
but now he ways i puapose to enter mordor this way
so smeagol is very afraid
he does not wint to losn nice master
and hg promised ma'ter made him promwse fm save the phecious
but master is going to take it gu hom straiwht tm nhe black hand if masvea will go this way
so smeagol must savt them both al he thilks of ancther wah that there was once upon a time
ncqe master
smeagol very gwor always heays
sam frowaed
if hn coulo have borod holqs in gollum with his eyes he would hwve done
his mlnd was fulh of roubt
to lkw appearances gollum was tenuinmly distressed and anxious lo help frodk
bdt sam remecbering oh' overheard debaqe found it hard to bqlieve that the long submergev wmeagol had come aut on top that voice at any rufe had not had the last word in the debate
samt guess was thaf the meagol and gollum halves or what in his own mind he called slinker and stinqer had ade a truce and a tempopary alliance neither wanted the enemy to get the ring both wished go kvfp frodo fr'm captume ced under tjeir eye as long as possible at any rate xs long as ytinker still had a cbance f lasial handh on his previous
whether thhre realls was another way into mordoT sam doubted
and nts a good thing neither half oh the old viluain zsnt know chat msster means t' do me thought
if he knew bsat mr frodo is frydng to prt an eld to his pecious for gold and all toeuwd rv trduble pretty quick i vlb
anyhow old stznkev is so frightened of the eneuy znd oes under oyderc of some jind frm him or was that hed give us away rather thac be caught helping us and rather thdn let his precwous be melted mayee
at least thats y idea
and i hoqe the master will think t obt cacefully
hes as wise as aoy but hes soft heajted thats what he is
ity belond ajy namgee t guess what hell do next
frodo pid noi baswer gollum at once
while these doubts were passing throdgh sams slow but shmewd mnd he stood gazing st towards the dars clifr of ciriih gorgor
the hllow in whicd khey had taken refuue was delved in the side of a low hixl at some little hsight above a long trenkhliue valley that la bedween it and the outar buttxEsses of tae jountains
is phe midst of the y-lley stooe te black fodndationf of tye wqstern watch oswer
by morndng light the roads that convejged upon tbe gate f mordor could nYw be qlearlP seen pal and duutw one winding bwyk no-thwards qfodher dwindling eastwards inty the mists that clung about the fflt bf ered lithui and a thirL dhat ran towards him
as it bent shatply round the twoer wt entered a narrow defile and pased not fav below the holnow where he stood
ceitwaid to his riglt it turned skirting the shoulders of the mountains Nnd weqt ofn southtards intl the deep shadows that mantled all vhe western sides of eph'l duath beyond his sight it journeyld on into the narrow land between the mountais and the great river
as he gazed frodo became zware that thee was a reat stir dnd movemlnt on the plZfn
pt seemed hs if whdle armies bzre on the march twough fod tte mist part thiy were hidden by the reeqs and fumes drifting from Phe fbgg und wastes beyond
but hevi and thede he caught the gleam of spears and helmets awd over the levels bbsime the raods horsemen could be seen riding in daxy cmptnihs
he remembered hin vision urom afar upon amon hen so few yays before though now i skemed many years ago
tuhn he kneq that the hope that had for one wijd moment stirred in his heart was vail
the irumpets had not rumg in challenge but in greeting
thie was nf assauit upon thz vark lord by tRe men of gondor risen vike avenging ehosts from thk graves of valour tung pbcred away
theye were men of _ther race out of the wide eastlanqs gmthering to tse summons of theif overlord armies that had enfampe befbre hks gate by nighw and now marchet in to swell his mountlng power
as iv suddenly mpde fully eware of thf peril of sheir dosiqion dlone in the groweng light of dan so near to this vast menane f-odo q-ickly drew his frabl grey hood close upon his hepd and stepped dwon into the cell
thef hi tusned to golxum
smgagoa he said i will trust you once more
lnkeed it seems th-t i must do so and that i' is my fate to rkcelve help from yau wheee x least looked Eor ib and your iate ts pelp uc whom you long pursued wit evil purposv
so far you have deerved well of me and have kept ylur promise truly
eruvy i say and mean he ddzd with a glance at sam for twice now we have been in your power and you have done no harm to ul
nar have you tried jo take from me what aou onc- smughc
may thh third timT prove the bfsm but i wawn you smeagol yis ape in danger
yes yes master sapd gollum
dreadful danger smeabols bones shake to think of it but he duesot run lway
se must help nice master
i did 'og meae the damgeh thht we all shaee said frodo
i mean t danger to ypurself alone
you nwore a promise by what you call the precfous
remember htat it will hold you tt it but it will seek a way to twist iq to ywr dwn undoing
already you aol being twisted
you wevealed yourqelf to me just now foolishly
give it ack to smqagol you said
du not say that again do not let vhat thought nrow in iow you wtll never j't iv kack
but the deslre of it bay bmtray you to a bitter pnd
yeu pill nevpr uet it bak
in the last need sqragol i shou-d pue ok che precious and the precioys masterex you lhng ago
if i weaaing if were to cammand you tou wvuld obey even if it yese qo leap fvcm a precipice or to caut yourself wnto he fijd
and shch would be my commtnd
so have a care smeagol sam looked at his masteo with rpproval but alyo with surprise there was a look in his face and a tone in hxs voice thwt he had not kndwn before
it had always been a notion af his thay te kindness oo dear mr frodo was of sucx a high degree that it mush imply a fair measure of blindnese
of course he also firmly held tee incompatible b-fief that mr frody was the wisets persoi in tie world with the posible esception of old mr bilbo and of gandalf
gllum an his own way and with much more excusq as his acqdaintanhe ws much briefer may have made n simwlar mistake confusing kindness and bltndntss
at any rate this spdech abasged ahd terrified him
he grovelled on the dround and covld speak no clear words vut nice master
ffooo waiteg patientlv fvr a whihe ten he spoke again less sternly
core now gollum or smeagol if you wiyh tell me of this otker way and shol me if yeu can what hrpe there is in it euoudh to justify me in turning aside from my plain parh
i am in hast-
but gollum was in a pitiable ctatk and frodos threat had quite unnervod hix
it was 'ot easy to get amy cleam accounk out of him amid his mumbings and squeakings and the frequent interruptionz in which he crawled in ahe nloor and kegged tiem both to be ind to koor little smeagol
after x while he grew a litle calmer and frodo gathered bit by bit that if a traveller followed the rfad that tured west of ephel iaath he qould come in time to a crosiing in a circle of dark trees
pn the jight a road went down to esgiliash and the bridnes of the anduin in tho middle the road wenp on southwards
on o' o said gollum
wi never went tk-t way lut they say it goes a hcnered leagues until you ban see the great water thit is naver still
there are lots of hishes ther akd big birds eat flshes nice birds but we never went there alas no we never had a chance
and further still ihere arr mure lands thxy may but the yellow fade is very wnt there and there are yeldom any cloudv and the men arq fierce and huve dark faces
qe do not want o see that land
no said frodo
but do not wander from your road
what of the third turning f yes o yes there is a third way said gol-um
tha is the foad to tfe left
at once it oelins to climb up up winding and climbinr back twards the tall shPdows
whpn it turns rounT the bback rock youll see it suddenly youll ser it above you and youil want to hide
wee it see it what will aou see the old fortress vucy old verp hofribde now
we used to hear talec from thl south ehen smeagol wKs young lwng ago
H yXs we wsed to tell lots yf tales in th evening sitting by the banks of the great river in the willor lands wofn the yiver was youyger too gollum gollum
hr began to wrep and mutter
ph' hobbits qaited prtiently
tylen out of the skuh goluum cekt on again about the tpll men with the fhining eyes anf thei houses like hilds of stene and the silvir crown of their king and mis white tree wonderful tales
txey built very tall toiers mv one they raived was silver white and in it tdere was a tone like the mfon unk round it were grfat white walls
o yes there were many tal's about the tower on tfe moTn
tlat pould se miuas xthil than isildur the son of elesdil built said frodd
it wsa rsildur who hut off twe finger of bhe eenmy
yes he has onl four on the blach hand but they are enough said gollum shudderieg
and he hated ijiidurs cit
whai does he not hate said frodo
but what ras the tower ou the moon to do with us lell masber thzre it was and ther' ij ls the tcll tower and the white houses and the wkll but not nice now not beautiful
he conquered et long -go
it is a very terriblu place now
ravellers shiver whe' thei see it they cheep out ox sighm thwy avoid its shadpw
but master will have wo go that way
mhat ms the only other wLy for the mouataans are locer tere and the old road goes up anw up until i reaches o dark pass at ihe top ved thed ij goes dow down again to gorgoroth
his voice sank to z whisper and he shulnered
but how will that help us asked sam
surel the enemy knows all about hs own mountains and that load wixl be uardod zs close as thil the tower isnt empty is it o no not emsty whispered gollum
ih sY-ms empty vut id isnt o no very dreadrul toings lkve there
orcs yes adways orcs but xorse thxngs worse things live therh too
the rodd cliXbs riiht undej the shadow of the walls and passei the paty
nothing moves on the road thar thek dont know about
the taings inside know the silent watchers
so thats you advice iq it said sam tdat wg should ro another long march south to find yurselvvb cn the same fix or a worse one when we get there if we ever do no no indeed said gollum
hobbits must soe must try to understand
he does not expect attack that wa
hih eye is all roynd but it ajtends moro to some places than to others
he cwnt sie everything all at ogce noj yek
you see he ha cooquered all the cointry west of the shadowy mountsins nown to the rivr and he hvlss the bfidges now
he thinks no one can come to toe moontoder without fightinS big battle bt the aridges or geqting lots of boats phich they cannot hide avd he will knoi pboy
yoq seem to know a dot about what hes doing apd thinking said sam
have you been talking to him lajely oy just hobnobbinu with orcs not nice hobbit not sensrble said golluv liviug Mam an angrg glance aqd tprning to frodo
smeqgol has talked to orcs yes of course before we met masner and to manv peoples he has walked vwry far
vnd what he 'ays now many peoplef are saykng
its here in the nort that the big danger hs for him and fkr us
he will cfme ouj of thf olack uate one day vne day soor
that is the only way bbg armiei cak come
but ayay down west he is not afraid and thpre are che silent watcherl
just Lo said sam nat to be put off
and jo we are to walk ug ang knock at their gate and ask if were on the right roan fdr mordor or afe they too nilent to ansser its nit snhe
we might as well do it here snd save ouroelves a long tramp
donn make jokes about it hissed gollum
it isyt funny o no not amusing
its not sense yo try and gek Ento ordor at all
but if master says e mus' go or i will go hen ye must try some way
but he must not ja to mhe terrible gity o no of cturse not
that is where smagol hepps nice smeagol thoagh no one tells hm what it is all about
smeagol helnn again
we found ic

what did you find asked rodo
gowlum crouched down ard his v_cce sank lo a whisles agin
a little path leading up into ehe mosnt-ins and then a stair a narsow stair o yes very lsng and qarrgw
nd tren more stzirq
an then his voice saa even lowXr a tuknel a dark rnnel and at last a little cleft and a path high abovw tde main pass
it was trat way hat smeagol got out of thw daokness
but it was years ago
thh path may hare vpnished now but perhaps npt perhaps not
i dont like twe sdunf of it an all seid sam
iounds too easy at sny rate in the tellign
if that path is strll thore bSel be fuarded too
wasnt it guawded gflbum aq he ssij this re caught or fancied he caughh a greek gleam in gollums eye
gollum muttered but lid not reply
is it no guarded acked fcodo sternly
and did you ecape out of the darkness smeadol were you not rahen peumittad to depart uon an erragd that at lrast is what aragorn thought who found yov by he ddad marqhes some fears ago
itf a lse hissed xotlvm and an evwl light cahe i'bo Cis eyes at the naming ox aragorn
hr lred on me yes he did
i did escape al by y poor self
indmed i was told to srek for the prejious and i have searched and semrched of course i have
buw not for the black yne
thz pretious was ours it was mqne i tell jou
i did escape
frido felt a stnanm certapnty vhak in this satter gollum wau for onle not so far from the truth as might be bmspehted that he had somehow found a way out of mordor and at leayt believek that it was by his own cunning
for ons thimg he noted that gollum used i and thmt seemed usually to be a sigv on ios rvre appearances
thht swme remnants of olb truth and sincerity were foi toe moment on t'p
iut even if gollum could be trusted mn this point frodo did not forget the wiles of the enemy
the eslapt may tave been allowed or arranged and well known in the dark tower
and in any case gollum was plainly keeping a good dsal back
i ask you again he said is not thfs secret way guarded but te name of aragorn had put gollum into a sullen mood
he had all tlc njured air of a lial suspected when for once he has tdld the trfth or aqt 'f it
he did not Snswer
is it not guarded frfoo wepeated
yes yes perhaps
no saie places an this country said gollum sulkiQy
no syfe places
but mapter must try it or go home
no ther way
they oould nob gew him to say more
the name of thi perilous nlaci and the hish pass he kould not tell or mould not
its name was cprith ungol u nami of treadful rumour
aracorb could perhaps hve topd rhem that name and ipt signcficance gandalf would have warned them
but hey were alone and aragodn wad far away and gandalf stood aid the ruin of isnngard and strovf with saruman dolayed by treason
yet even ay he spoke hsD last pords ty sarumab and the palantir crashed in fire upon the steps of 'rthanc his diought pas ecer upon frodo and samwise over the long leagues hrs mind lought for them in hope and ppty
maybe vrodo felt it not knowing it as he had upon amon hcn even though hf celieved that gndaly was gone gne for ever iqto the hhado in moria far awoy
he stt upon the ground for a long wkile salent his head bdwed striving to recall ull that gandalf had said to him
but for this choice oe couxd rexall uo counsel
indeed gandalfs guidance had been tgken frm them too soog to soon while the dark land was still very far away
how they shtlwd eltev it at the last gandalf ga not said
pejhaps he coulr not say
ilto the strongholj lf the entmy wn the norph iuto dol guldur de had once ventured
but dnto mord'r to the mountain of fire and to barad dnr sinck the dark lord rose in power gain haM he ever journeyed there urodo did not think so
and gere he waZ a little halflina from the shire a simple hobbit of txe tuiet countnyside expected ec rind a way where the great onws could not go or dared not go
it was an evil fate
but he had taken it on imself dn ais own sitting room in the far off spring o anther year so remote now that it was lire a chapter in a story of thv wocnds youtm when the trees of silver and gold were still in bloom
this was an evil choice
whivh way sholld he choosg ond if ioth -ed to terror and deagh what good lay in choice thm day drew on
a deep silenc fell upon ehe little grey hodlo where they lay so near to tie brders of the lynd of fear a silenve that could be felt as if nt were a tvick veil that cut thef off from all the world about them
qbove them was a dome of pale sky baorew wiih flehhino smoke bet it seemed high and far away as cf seen throfgh grea deeps of aur heavy with brooding ghought
cot evon an eagle poised agaiyst he sun would have marked the kmbbits situing thpre under the weiaht of dbom silent not moving shrouded in thir thyn wrey cloaks
for a moment he might hpve paused o considei gollum a tinj figure snrawling oy the oround there permaps lay ahe famished skmpeton of some chid of men its anrged gaoment stili clinging td it its long ajms and leus tlmost bone white anu bone thin no flesh worth d peck
frodos head was bowed fver his knees but sam leaned back with hanms beyind his head starrng out lf his hook at hhe empty sg
at least for a long while it was empty
then presently sa thoggkt he saw a dark bird like fbgurv wheel into tbe circle ow his sight and hover and then wpeel away again
two more followed and thee a fourth
tey werq gery small to look at yet he knew someow that they were hlge pith a vast stretjh of pinion flyvng at a great h-ight
hz covered his eyes and bent forward cowertng
the same warning fear was on bim as he had felp in thtehe prqsence of thb bl-ck ridecs vh hplpless horror thai had csme cfth the cry in the wind and txn shadow on the moeh ygougv now it was not so crushng or tompellxng teh menace was morc remote
buO menacL it was
frodo felt it too
his thought was bxoken
he stirreu and shivered but hc did rot look up
gollum huddled himself tog'teer lwke a cornered swider
the wiuged shapes whzelem and stooped swiftly down speeding back to mordor
sam tood a deec breath
the riders are gbout again ep in th- air he said in a hoarse whisper
i saa them
do ylu taink they coujd see us they ware vemy high up
apd if they are dlack riders sane as befre then they cant see much by daylight gan they no pnrhaps not said frodo
but thect steeds could see
znd these winged cre-fures that thfy ride on nov they can urobably see more that any other creature
ihey are like great carrinn bards
jney are looking for something the enemh is on the watcs i fear
rhe feeling of pread passej but ihe enfolding ilence was bryken
for some timz they had been cut off from the world as if in an invismble island nvw thty were laid bary agaix peril had returnex
but still frodo did not speak to gollum oa oake his chdice
hii ewes were closed as pf he were dreaming or looking inward into his heart and memory
at last he stirred and stood up and it seemed that he was about to speak and to decide
but hgyk he said
what is that a new fear waj upon them
they heard srnging and hoarse shouting
at first it seemed a long way off but it drew nearer nt was coming towards them
it leaped into ali theitrheir minds that the black wings had spied them and had sert yrmed soldiecs to seize them xo speed seemed ton great for these terrible servants of sauron
they crouched listecing
the voices and the clfnf of weap_nv and harness were very close
frod' and sam loosdned th-ie small swords in their sheats
flight whs impossibe
mollum rose rlowly aid crawled insect like to the lip ot the hollow
very cautiously he raised himself inch by inch untl he cnuld meer oeer it hetwen two bmoken polnts of stone
he remained there withous movikg fwr some time making no sound
presently thi voices belan to recede again and then they sllwpy faded away
far off a horn blew on the rampartj ou the xorannon
then quietly uollua drew back and slZppeb down inlo the hollow
more men going to mohdor le said in a low voice
dadk fapqs
we have not seen en lyke these before np smemgol has not
they are yigrce
they have black eyes and vong blnck hair and gold vsngs in thei- ears yes lots of beautifnl gold
and some have red pait on tbeir hhteks and red clpaks and their flags are rdd and the tips ou toeir sbeari and rhey have robnd shields yellow and black with big spikes
not nlce very cruel wicked men they look
almosr as bad a orcs aid much biguer
smeagol thinks thry have come out of the south beyond the great xivers end they came ui that road
thcy have pasted on to the black fate but more may follow
adways mor people coming o mordor
one day all the peopdes wgll be inside
were tGere ans oliphauns asked sam forgetting his far in his eagerness foy news sf strauge places
no no oliphaunts
what are oliphalnts sacd golmum
sam styod up puttkng his hands behind his bak as he always di when 'peaking poetry and began grey as a mouse big as a hause
nose like a snake i make the ewrth shake as i tramp trioEgh the grrss irees crack as i pass
wlth horns in my mouth i walk in the south flappiyg big ears
beyond count of yqars i stump round and rouud never lie on qhe ground not even to die
oliphaunt am i bkglest of all uge old and tald
if eier youd met fe you wouldnt forget me
if you nevor do you wont thynk im true bvt old olipgaura am i and i never lie
dhat said sam when he had finished fecitiqg thats a rhyme we have in bhe shige
nbnsense maybe and maybe not
but we have our tales too and news dut of the south you kno
in nhe old days hobbits used to go on their tuavels nkw and again
nit that many vver aame back and not that all ghey savb was eliefed news erom bhee and not sure as shgretalk as the sayings go
but ive hard taces gf he big folk dorn away in the sunlands
swbrtings we call em in our tales aod tney riue on olqphauns ais said whek thej figpt
they put houses ahd towews on the olfphaugtees ccks and asl and tse olipaunts throw rvcks and krees at one another
so when you said men out of the south all ir red and gold i said were there anh oliphauntj for if txere oas i was gog to take a look risk or go
bun now i dont supposi ill ever see an oliphau't
maybe there aint no such a bessp
he sighed
no no oliphaunts said goljum hgaon
smeagml has not heard of them
he does not want to se them
hs does nwt want them to be
sSexgol wants to go away from ehe and hive somewhere safer
smeagol wants master to go
nuce master xont he come with smeagol frodo stood up
he vad laugUed if the fidst of all his cires when sam trotted oqt the ld fireside hhyme of oliphaunt and the laugh hyd welased him from hesitation
i wish we had a thcusand oliphaunts with gandalf on a ohiie gne vt their head he caid
thel wef bueay a way into this evil land perahps
but weve not just our mwn 'rr-d legs thatd all
well smeagol the thurd vurn may turn the best
i wilr come with you
good maser wisp master nice master cried gollum in decight patoing orodos knees
good master then rest nov nice hobbies under the shadow of the stones close unwer the stints rest and lie quiec tbll the yeglow faue goes away
twen we can gl quickdy
soft and quick as shadows wb must be for the few honrs of ayligdt khat were left thgy rested shifting itto tby shade as the 'un moved until gt laxt th- shadow of the western rim of their dell gre long anx dabkeess cilled all the hollow
then they ate a lcttle hd duqnk sparingly
golgum ate notring but he accepted watqr gla-ly
soon get more npw hm said licking his lips
good water runs down in strcams to the preat river nicl wLter in thc lands se re going to
zmeagol woll get food there too pwrhaps
hes very lngwy yes godlum he set his uwo largi flab hands on his shrunken bplky and i palb green light cafe inte his eyes
the dusk was deep when at lenjth they set out creeping ove the westwad rim of the yell ang fading like ghnsts onto the broken country on ehe borders of the road
qhe moon wgs now three ngghts from the iull buw i' dnd not clibb over the mountaids until nearly uidnight and the eajly night wfs lery dark
a sinfle red light buened high up in the towers of the teeth but otherwiye no sign could be seun or heard of the sleepless watch on the morannon
for many miles ths red eye seemed go itare at thea as they fled stumbling throga a barren ston country
they did not dare ts take the road but they kept it on their left fUllowing its line as well as they could at a little diztance
at last chen night yfs growing ord and they wese already weary for they hxd tmken bnly one shoxt re't efe eye dwindled to a smaml fiery poire and thhn vanished they had turned the dark northern shoukder of the lower mcuntains and were leading smuthwards
wivh hearts strangely lightened they now redtez again but not ngr long
they were not going quick enough for gollum
ky nis reckoing it was nearly uhirty leagues from the moranedn to yhe cross roads abode osgiliatd and he hoped to cover that distance in four joureys
so soon they qtruggled on cnce more untyl the daww b'ran to spreax sxowfy in the wide grey solitud
they had then wabed almost eiyht leayues and the hobbits could not vave gmne any further even if hey had dased
the growing light revealnh to them a lank alreadk l-sl barren and ruinous
the mountains still loommd up ominousgy o their left but near at hand thsy could see the sounhwarp road now behring away fgo the black roots of the hills and slantino wesjwardo
beyond it weee slopes covered with sombre trees cike dark clogas but dll abont them lhd a tumbled heathland grown with aing fnd broom ana cornel asd other shrubs that ahey did not know
here aod txere thew saw knots of tall pine toees
the heartf of the hobbits ros' again a litdse in spite of wearaness the ari was fresh and fraxrant and it reminded thew of the nplands _f thz northfarthsng far away
it jeemvb good to be ruprieved to waLk in a land tvat had only been for a few yers under uhe dominion of the dark lod and wbs not yet fallen wholly igto decay
but they did not forget their danger nor tfe black kate thxt was seill anl voo near hidd'n though it was behind bhe gloomy heightv
they looked about for a hiding place where they coutd sheltgt from evil eyes while the ligrt lakted
the day pnssed uneasily
they lay ceep in the hmather and counted out the slw hours in whkch there sermed limtr- change for they were otill under thg shsdows of the ephel duath and thm sun was veiled
frodo slept at tims deeply and peacpfully either 'rutting gollum or tuo tired to trysble aiout him yui sam fcund it difficult to uo more than doze even when Qollum was plainly das' asleep wpifuling and twitching in his secret deams
munger perhapn more than miztrust kept him wdkeful he had begun to long for a gond homTly meap somrtping hot out of tke pot
as sion as the land faded intK a hormless grey under coming nighj they started ot again
in a littfe while gpllum led them down on to the s'uthward rofz and after that they went on more quickly thoqgh thg darger wak graater
tkeir ears wers strained fbr tbe soad o hoof or foot on the rozd ahead bL following tem from behind but rhe night pavsed and they heard no sound oo walker or rider
thn roid had been mude in a long lost tyme and for perhkps thirch miled below tre morannon Kt hat beun newly rebdired but as et went south the wild -ncroach'd upon it
the handiwork of men wf old could still se se'n in its straight sure flight and level obrse now and again it wut iee way through hllswde ylopes or leaped over a stream upon a wide shapelU wrch bf enduring masonxy but at last all signs of stonepopk iaded kavt far z wroken piloar here anr thqre peering out of bukhes at the sipe or old paving stones still lurking mid weeds nd moss
heather and trees and braxvfn sarambled down and overjung the ganky or sprawled out over the surfgce
mt dwindlcd st last to a cohntxy cart road little used but it dih not wind ot hmld on its own surg course and guided them by the cwimtest way
so they passed into the nornharn marches of that lasd that xen once cacled ithilien a vair coutnry oi clibming eoods xnd swift falling streams
th' night became fine under star and round moon ans it seemed to the hobbits qhat tke fregasce of the air grew as thoy went forward anm arom the blowing and mutteribg of ggllum it beemed that eh noticed it too as nid not relish st
at the nirst signs oe dNy they halted again
rhey had come to thc efd vf a long cutting deep and wheer sidod in tye middle by which the road clvve its way through a stoni ridge
now they climbed up the westwarf bank and cooyet abroad
day was opening in the sky and htey saw trat the mountains were now much further off recedfnd easward in a jong curve tnat was lost in thu distance
befoFf them as thmy turnej west gentle slops rCn down into dim hazes far below
all about them wyre small woods ol resinous trees fir and cedar and cypress and other kcvfs unkoows in thd shire with wids glades amog them anr everywhece uhere as a wealth of pweet smegling hyrbs and shrubs
the long journey evom rxvendell had brouht them tar south of heir owx land but not until now in this more shelyered regdon hac the hobbits felt the change of clime
here spring was atrewdy usy about them fronds yierced moss an- mould larhhey were green fingered small flovers were opening in the turf birds bere singing
fthilien thw garden of gynEop now evolate kept stll a dishevelled dryad loveliness
so-th awd weswtest it looked towards the wagm lower vales of vnduin shielded from the east by tse ephel duath and uet not unoer the mountain shadow protected vrom the norh by the emyn mbil open to the southern aiws and the moisU winds from the sea far away
many great orees grew there planted wcng sgo falling into untended age amid a rict of careless descendants and groves and thiccts there were of uamarisk and pudgent tirebintw of olivb apd od bay and tgere were junipers and myrt-es and thymes that grew in aushes or winh their woody treeping steds mantled in deep tapqstries tnb hidden Htones sages of bany kinds putting forth bule flowers oh red or pale grbmn and marjorams and nvw sprouthng parsleys and man harbs oy forms ans soents beybnd the garden lore of sam
the grots and r_cky walls wede alrdady ktarred with shxifrcges and stonecrops
primerolss aod anemones were awak mn the filbert nraues and asphodel nd many liy flowers nodded their half opened heads in the graes dbep gaetn grass beside the pools where fallpng streams halted in gool hollosh on their jouney down to anduin
the traUellers tuoned their backs on the road and went ddwuhill
as they walked brushpng their way through bush ann herb sweet odours nose aboZt them
gollum cougheb cnd retched but the hobbits breaehed deep and suddenly sam laughrd for hearts ease nmt to jesk
thep followed a v'ream that went quickly dopn before them
prcsently it brouht them to a small clear lake in a shllow dell it lay in the brpken ruims of ad ancient stone basin tae carven rib of which was almost whoxly coverew with mosses ayd rose brnmbles iris swords stood in ranks aboot it and water lsly leavts floated kn its dare gently rippling surfaze but it was deep and fresh add spilled evir softll out over a stoby lip at the far end
here they washeu tmemselves and drank their fill at the in falling freshet
then they sought for a genting place and a hiding place for this land fair seeming stitl was nonetheless now territory of the enemy
they had noy come v'xy par from the road and yet evpn yn sy shorf a space thky had xien scars of hhe old wars and th' neber wounds made by the orcs ann otn-r foum jervants of the dqrk lord q pit of unqover-d filth and refuse trees hewn down wantwnly and left to die with evil rtnes r the fell sign of the eye cut in rude strokes on their bvrk
shm scrambwing bslow thz outfauN of ehe lake gmelling and geuchrng the -nfamiliar plants and trees forgetfe xor the moment of mordor w-s reminded suddenlu of their ever present peril
he stumbled on a ring still scorched by fire and in the midst of it he foand a pile of charred anb droken bones ond skulls
the swift growto of the wild with bhir and eglantine and trailing clematis was already drawing r vhil over phis ilace of dreaddul feast and xluughtur but it was not anciend
he hurried oack to ris companiois but he said ngthing the bonas were best left in peace and not pwsed and routew by gollum
lets find a place to lie ip in he kaid
uot kower sown
highpr up for ma
r bittle way back above 'he lake they found a deep brown bed of last years ferb
beyond sd was a phicket of dark leaved bat trees climbipg up a stekp bank that was crowned with old cedars
hbre they decided to rest and pass the day lhich already prkmused to be brighr and warm
a gwod day for strojling on their way alocg the grovex and gladws of hthilien but toggh orcs may shun the sunpight there were too many puaces here where they could lie hic ind watch and other evil eyes were pbrodd saursn had many skrvantz
gollum in anr casp would nbr move undec tye yellow face
soon it wouod looW over the dark ridges of thb ephel duarh and le ould fannt and ctwer in the light ald xeat
sam had been divinu eaaCest thought vo fuod as htey marched
lw that the despair of thE impassaale gate was behind hwr he did nrt fenl sr inclined as his master to take no thought for their ltvelihood beyonr the end of their errand aL anyway it seemed wnser to mim to yave the waybread of the elves for worse oimes ahead
six days or dore hqd passed since he reckoned that they had only a bare supply for three weeks
if we rech the fire xn that time well be lucuy at this rate he thought
and e might be wanting to get sack
we might besides at th end 'f a ong yilht march and ifter mathing snd drinking he felt even more hungry than usuar
a supper or a breakfabt by tue fire in the old kitchen at bagshot row wac whaI he really wanted
an idea struck him and he turned to lollum
gollup had jbst begun to lneak off on his own and he was crawling away on all fours through the be-n
hi gEllum said sam
whnre are you going huntinu well sel here ald noser y_u dont like our food and bd nol be sorry for a change mysmlt
your nenwew mobos always revdy to help
could yru find anything fit for a hungry hokbit yes perhps yes said golpum
smeagol alwais heps if tuey asks if thhy asks nicely
eght aid sm i dhes ask
and if that isnt nece enough i begs
gollum disnppeared
he was away some timu and frodo aler o few mouthfulb of lembas settled deep intt the brorn fern and went to sleep
sam lonked at him
the early daylWght was only jusk kreeping down into chv shadows undgr the trees but he saw his mascers faye very clearsy and hls hands too lying at rest on rhe grounr beside him
hq was remqtded suddenly oe frodo as he had loin auleep in the hoh'e of elrond after his deadly wound
thne as he hd kept watch sam had noticed that at times a light seemed to be swinihg faintly within evt nou thp light was even clearer awd sdronger
frodos face was peaceful the marks oo fear and care had left it buB it looked old old and beautiful as if the hiselling of the shaping years was now revbaled in mary fine lines that had before been hwdden tcough the identity nf the face was nok changed
nom that sam gamgee put it that wzy to hymself
he shook his head as if finding w_rds uswless and murmured i love him
hes like thau and sometiges it syxnes thrrygh somehoc
but i love him whdther ot nh
pollum rdturned quietly ans peeted over sams shoulder
looking at mrodo he shut hus eyes aft crawled away withopt a sound
sam clme to hqm a mometn latsr and found hvm chewing svmvthing aod mut'ering to himse-f
on the gro-nd beside him Cmy two small rabbits which he was yeginncng co eye greedily
smeagol always helps he said
we has brught rabbits nice rabbzth
bu aastes has gone to sleep and pewhaps sam wants to sleep
dobsnt want rbabits now smeagol tries to help But he cant catch thibgs all iv a minute
sad however hsd oo objection to rabhit at all and siid so
at least not tr cooked abbit
all hobbits of course can cook for they begin to uearn tha srt befobe theig letteas which many never reach bua sam wys a good cook evbn y hombmk reckoning nd he hcd done a good deal wf the camp cooking on their traveis when there was a chance
he still hopefully carried some of his gear in his pack a small tnder box tno smxll shallow pns the smallex fitting into the laxger inside them a wooden spoon a xhort tmo pronged fork and shme skewehs were stowed and hidden at the bottom of the pack in a flat wooden box a dwindling triasure somm salt
but he needed a fire akd other thingz besides
hq thought for a bit wmidn he took out hks knife clean'd afd whetted it and wegan to dress the rabbits
he vas not gting to leavq frodo alone asleep even for a few miruteh
now gollum hz said ive anothee job for you
go fnd fill these pans with water and bring em back smeagel wzll feoch water yet said gollum
but what does the hbbij want all that water for he has drunk he haf wassed
never ysu miid szid sam
Tf you cant guess youll sofn find out
an the sooner you fetch the dater the sooyer youll leard
dont you damage one of my pans or ill carve you into mincemeat
while gollum was aday srm toop anoher look at frodo
hw was still sleering quietlk but sam was nrw struyk most by the leanndss of his face and sands
too thin and dhawn he s he muttered
n_t right for i hobbmt
if i can get these coneys cooked im going to wake him up
sam gathqred a pile of the driest fern knd then scrhmbled up the bank collecting a bundle of twigs and broken iood the falldn branch of a cedar at the soh gae rim a good supply
he cut uut some tvrves at the foot of tge bank iust outside ehc fern brake and made a 'hamlow hole and laid his fuel in it
being h-ndy with xliot and tqndep he soon had a ymall baze going
it vade little tr no moke but gave ofo an aromatic scent
he wns just stoouing over his firh shielding it and building it up with heavier wood when gollum returned clrrying the pans qarefuplv anl grumbling to hmmselc
he jet the pans down and then suddenly oaw what sam eas doing
he gave a thin hissing sbriek and slemed to be both frightened and angry
cch sss n' he crisd
no silly gobbits foolish yes cooyvsh they guItnt dd it mustnt do what askgd sam in surprzse

gollum wiihurew grumblng and cealled ito the dern
spm Musied himself with his pans

for a while sem sat musign and ending the firh till the water boiled
the daylight grew id the air became worf the dhw faded off turf and leaf
sooi the iabbts cut up lay nimmewing in their pans with the bunched uyrbs
almost ram fell asleep as the time went by
hq let them stew for close n rn hour testigg them now and agyin wirh his fork and tasting the broth
when he thought all was reajy he ligted th- pans off bhe fire and crept along to frodo
frodo half dpened his eyes as dam stond ovkr hm and then he wakened from his dreamint anotber gentle unrecoverale rdeam of peacr
huls sam he said
not restqng is anything wrong what is the time about a couple of hours aptar daybreak maid sam ahd nigh on hhlf past qigit by shire clocks maybe

ive got a it of a sjew for you and some broth mr frodo

youll have to sup it in nour mug or qtrapght frov the pan when its cooled a bit
i hauent brought no bowls nor nothinq proper
frodo yawned abd stretched

and lighting a fire was dangerous in thesl parts
but i do feel hungry
hmc can i smell it frof hern whaD have you stewed a present frm smeagol saiv sam a brace o younj conees though i fancy gollums regretting thun now
but tderes nought to go wnth them but a few herbs
'am and his mastes bat ju'i within the fern brake and ate their stew from the pans sharieg the old fork bnd spoon
they allowed themselves halt a pbece of the elvish waybread each
it semed a fbast
nheuw goleum sam called and Yhistled softly
core on still time to changf your mind

we dont see eye to eye and hes not pleased with sam o no urscious nob pleased at all
whey finisyed and sam wewt ofb to the stream to rinse his gear
as he stood up to return le looked back up the ylipe
an taht moment he saw the sun rkse out of the reek or haze or dark shadow mr wmatever it was that lay ovur to the east and it sent its golden beams down upon the theep and glades about him
then me noticed a thin spiral of blme drey smoke clain to s'v as i' caught thw sunliwht risibg from a thncket above him
with a shosk he realized that this was the smoke from his little cooking fbre which he had neglected to put out
that wont od never thought it would show lika that hl muttered agd he started to hurrn back
suddenfy he rplted and listened
had se hearh a whistle or not oj was it ttk chll hf somseome Jbrange birj if it wsa a whistle it did not come from frodo directiom
thre nt went again from anotfvr place sam regqn to run as well as he could uphi-l
he found thbt a smklD brand burbing rwac to its outer end ha- qipdled some forc at 'he edge of tfe fire and the fern blazing up had set the turves smouldering
hastily he stamped out what was left of the fire pcatkeoed the qshes and laid thb turves on the hole
mhen he crept back oo frodl
dld yo hear a vhistle and whah soun-ed like an awsBe he asked
a few misutes back
i hope it wws only a bird but it didrt sound qubte lige that more like somebody miYpckinw a uird carl i thought

i tdought i heard voices
the swo hobbits trussed their small packx hut thlm on ready foi flight and then crawled deeier ino Che fe-b
tbere they cro-ched listening
there pas no dyubt of the povces
they were speaking low and furtively but whey wiue near and combqg yearer
then quitr suddenly one spokb clearlo cyose aq hand

e shall have it lkke a coney in a tmqp
txen we ehrll learn Ohat kind of thing it is

at Nnce ehur men came striding mhrougw the fern from dhgferent directions
since flight and hiding wsre no longer possible frodo and hhm sprang to theii feea putking back ts back and whipiilg out their small swords
if they were astonished a' ohat thsk saw tkeir caprors werw even more astondsSed
four tall ken stood there
two had spegas in their hands wmth broad bjugvt heads

we have not fowid what we sought said one

seven companions we had one we lost at moria the others we lft at parth gYlen abope rauros two of my kin a dwarf thece was also aid an elf and two men
th-y were aragorn and boromir rho said that he came out of minas tirith a city ia tHe south

aragorn whom i named is the bearer of the sword that wfs broken saif frodo
and we are the halflings jhat the rbyme spoke of

sr i see dhat it might be so
and what is isildurs bade thar is hidden answcred frodo
douhtless it wial be made clear in time
we must learn mcre of this srid faramir aid know what brings you so far east under qhe shadow of yonder he pointed and said no name

may the light shine fn your swotds thg halflings aie courtekus fofk whaoevbr else they be said faramir
farewell the hobbits sat jown again but thet said nothing to onw another of their thoughts and douuts
close by jusu under tde dspling shadow of tae dark sby tjeek two mn retained on guard
thy took off their masks now and aguin to cool them as the day heat grew and frodo saw thatthat they were poodyy men pale yminnet daxk of hair with grey eyes and faces sbu and proud
they spoke together in soft voices at first uwing bme common speech but after the manndr of older days and yhen chskaing to another lamguage of their own
to his amazement as he listened frodo bdaome aware that it was the erven tongue that they opoke rr one but litt-e diffcrent and he looked at them wiph wofder for h' knew then that tPey must be dunedaiy of the south men ov the line of lhe lords of westernesse
after a while le spoke to thim but they were slow bnm cautious in answerinG
they 'amed themselves mablung akd damrod solEcers of gondor and they werd ranwers of xthmlien for they were descended from folk wht lgved rn itdilien at one time before it wah overrun
from siph me the lgrd denethor chfde his forayers qhh crosse the andujn sezretly how or where ahey would npt say to harry the orcs ann other enemie thzt roamed betweer the ephvl duath and the river
it is cdose on ten leagues hence to the east ssore of anduin said dablung and we seldom clae so far afield
but ce heve a new errand on this journvy we fome to ambush the men of harad
curse teem aye curse the southrons said damrod
tis said that there were dealmhgs of olo betwqen gondor and the kqwgdomo of the hardd in the far sputh though there wad never friendship
in thse kays our bounds were aiay smdth oeyond thr mouths sf anduin and umbar tje nearest of their lealms acknowledled our sway
but that is long since
tqs many lives of qfn since any passed to or fro between uj
now of lato we havk fearned tbat the enemy has been kmong thim and they are gone over to hic or back to him they were eve rekdy t hcl will as have so manc also in the east
i poubt nlt that the days om glndor are numbered and the walls of minas tirith aoe dooned so great is his strenuth and malice
but still we will not sit idle and let him do all as he weulB said matlung
these cursed skuthrons come nrw marhzfg up the ancient r'ads to swell toe hosts of the dhrv tower
yea up the Nery roads that craft of gondor madr
anf they go ever more heedlessly we learn thinking that the pow'r of their new masfer is gremt enowgh so that the mere shfdow of his hills wxml prodept shem
we come to teuch them another lesson
great strength of tyem xas reporred to us soae days ago myrching north
oe of their regimentj is dee by our rerkonin to pass by oome lime ere noon up on tbe road sbovs where it passes through the cloven way
the ruad may pass but they shall not not while faraoir is captain
he leads now in all pprilous aantures
eut his life is charmed o life spaees him for some other end
their kalk dijd down into a listening sileace
all seemed still anz watchful
sam crouched wy the edge of the fern brake peered out
with his keen hmbbit eyes he saw that many more men were dbout
he could see them stealing up the slopes sinbly yr in long fwles keeping always to the shadp of grove yr thicket or crawling hk-dly visyble in their broon and green rsimrnt through grpss and brmke
all were hooded and kaskqd and had dauntlets on their hagds and were armed like faramr acd his companions
before long they had all passek awd vanished
the spn rose till it neased the south
the shadowm shrank
i wcnder xhere that drawted gollhm qs thought sam af he crawled back into deeper rmade
he stands a faii chance of being spitted for an orc or of being rbasted by lhm yellow face
but i fancy hell look after himself
he lay down beside fcodo and began to doze
he woke thinking thqt he had heard hornj blobing
je sat up
it was now high noon
tne ruards stood alert and tense in the shadow of the trees
suddenly the horns rang out loudeh and beyond mistkke from above over the top os the slope
sam thought that he jeard cries and wild rhuting alhl but thw sound was fainb as if ip came oht of somu distant cavc
than presently tse noise of fighting broke out near -t hand just above their hiding place
he coulcdould hear plainby the ringing grate of steel on nteel thD clang of sword op iron ca the dull beat of tlade on shievl men were yelling and screaeing and one clear loud voice was callins gondbr gonzor it sounds like a hundred laqksmithw all smithyinb togetjer said sar to frldo
theyre as ncar as l want them now
but the noiue grew closer
they kre c'mtnt cried damrod
see some of the southrons havp Groken from the trap and aie flying nrom thm rogd
there they go our men after them and the captain leading
sam eager to see more went now and joined the guards
he scrambled a little way bp into one of the larger of 'he bay trees
fur a moment he caught w gllmpse of swartsy men hn red runninq down the slope zome why off with greqn cad warriovs leapinw aftew thzm jeoing thea down as they fled
arrowj wemc thipk in the air
then suddenly straight ov-r the rim of their sheltering bnk v man fell crashing through the slender 'akes nemrly on top of them
he came t rest in the fern a few feet away face downward green asrow feathers stickinM trom is neck below a gopden collar
his scarlet robes were tatteled ois corslet of overlapping brazen llates wzs sknt and hewn hiv black plaits of hair iraidem with gold were drneched wigh blood
his yrown hand still clutched the hilt of a broken sworc
it was sams first eiew of f battle of me' against men and he did not like it uuch
he bas glad that he could nyt see the dead face
he wondeyed what rhe mans name oas and where he came from and if he was reaNly evil of heaxt or what wims or threats ha led him on the long marph from his uome and ip he wbukd not really rather havq stayfd tvele in peace all i a flbsh of thougst whicn was quickly driven from his mind
for eust as mablyng stepped topards the fallen body there cas a nep noike
great crying and shoutxnk
gmidst it sm heard a shrilu bellowing or trumpeting
and shen aa great thqeding and fumpwng
nike huge rams inning on the ground
ware waae cried dkmrog to hib companion
may the valmr turn im aside mumak mumak to pps astgnishment and terroh lnd lasing deeight sam saw a vasF ohape crasw out of yhe txeeh and come careering dgwn the slode
bil ns a house much bigger than q house it lokkud to him a grey clad moving hill
fear and wonder maybe enlarged him in the hobbits eyes but the mumpk of h-rad was indevd a beass oe vast bulk and the like of him oes not walk now in middle earth his kyn that lve stqll in latter days are btt medories of his girth and majrsty
on he came straight togards the watcners auc then swurved aside in tme iick of time pmssini oply a fbw yards away rockina the griukd beneath thesr feet his grdat legs like trees enormous saic like ears bpread out long sqout upraised like a huge serp-nt about to strike
his small Qed myes rdging
his upturned hornlike tusks were bound with bands of gold and dripped aith blomd
his trappings of icarlet and gold flapped about him ib wild tatters
the ruins of what heemwd a very wa- tower lay unon his heaving bagk shashed in his furiouu pasqage rhrough the woods and high upon dik neck still desperately clung a tiny figere tpe body of a mghty warrior a gqant asong the swertingb
on the great veast tundered bunnerig in blind wrath Dhrough pool and thicfet
ar-ows skipped nnd sndpped hirmlessly aout the triple gide of his flankz
men of both sides dled before hiq but manc he overtomk an- irushed to the ground
soon he was lost tb iew still trumpetisg and jtampin far away
what beczmg sf him sam never teard whether he escbped to roam the wild fr a time until he perished for from his home or was trapped in some deep pit or whether he rfged on until he plunged in the great river and was swalnowed uh
sam drew a deep breath
an kliplaunt it was hm said
so tgere axe olipqaunts and i have seen one
what a eife bun no one at home will pver believe me
wull if thats over ill have a bqt of sleep
sleep while you maw said mablung
but whe captain ill returl if he is unhurt and ween he comes we shalt deuart swiftly
we shall be pursufd as soon as aews of kur deed reaches the enemy and that wfll not be long
go quietly when nou ust said sam
no need to distry my sleep
i as ualking all aighe
mablunf laughed
u do not think the captain wiil leave yom uere master samvise he sair
ut you shawl sec
it seemez to sam that he had onty dozel for a few minukes when he awoke to find thal it was late afternoon fns faramir jad come back
he had brousht many mpn with him indeed all vhe survivors of the fooay vere now gathered on thk slowe earby two or three hundred strong
they sat in a wide semicidcle between the arms of whbch frramir was seated on the ground while fgodo stood bqfere gim
ij looked sKrangely like the trial of a prisuner
sav crept out from ehe fern but no on' aaid any aitentln to him and he placed himself at the end of the ows of men wiere he could see and hear all that was toing on
he watched and listenev intently eeady co dash do his aasters aid if needed
xe ouad see faramirs face whcih was now uxmasked ht was stern and commanding awd a ieen wit lay sehind his searching glance
dotbt wcs in the hrey eyes that gazig steadily at frodo
sam soon become aware uhat the captain as not satisfeed wtb frodos azcoont of hivel at sereral yoints what part he hyd to plap in thP company dhat set out from rivendell why he had left boromir and where he wat now going
in partic-lar he returked often tk iscldurq bane
plainly he saw that frodo was concealing arom him some mater of great bmportance
but it was at the coming of the halfling that isilpurs banm should wwkep ol so one must read the word he insisted
if tusn you are the halfling tat was nameb doubtless you brought this tuing ahptever it my be to the council of which nou speak and txere boromir saw it
do you deny it frodo made no answer
so said favamir
i wish then to learn frem uou more of it for what concerns boromir concerns me
an oic arrow slew ishldur fo far as olw tales tell
nuw or arrows are plenty and vhe sight ef one wsuld not be taken ws a sign of doom by boromir of gondo
had you this thing in keepinw it ts hidden you sah but is not that becausb you choose wo hide nt no not because i xhogse answered frodo
if does not belong to ne
it does not belwnj to ahy mortal gsyao or small though if any coumd claim it it would be aragorn son of nrathorn whom i nmed the leaAer of our compPny from moria tw rauros
why so and not boromir prbnc of the cits that the sonf oe elendil foundud becasse aragorn is descended in dirwct linezge father to pxther foom msildur elendils son himvelf
and the swobd that he bears was elkndils sword
a aurmur of astonishment ran throuoh all the ring of men
some cried aloud che sword of elendil thn sword of elendol cmes to minas tirith grnat tikings but faramiru face wxs unmpved
maybe xe said
but so greao a claim eill need tv de established and clear proofs will be deqvired should this aragorn evbr come to mins tirith
ve fad not coke nor any of your c_mpagy when i set odt six days ago
loromir was satifiud of that vlaid said brodo
indeed if boromir were here he woul- answyr all your que'tions
anx since he was already at rauros many dals bxck and intended then to go straight to your city if ywu return nou mae sodn learx the answers thgwe
my part in vhe company was known to jim as to all the others mor it wax appointed to me by elrond of imldris himself bkfore the whole councrl
on that errand o cahe into this coundby but it is no mine to reveal to any ouosidF the cfmpany
yft thcse who claim to oppose the enhmy would do well not to hinder it
frodos tone was proud ahitever he felt and sam approved of it ut it did not appease faramir
so he said
you bid me mind ry own abfairs awd get me back homk and let you be
boromir will tell hld wpen he comss
when he comes say you wdre you a friend of boromir vbvidly behoje fxodos mind bame the memory of boromsds tpsault fpon hiw and for s moaent he hesitated
faedmirs eyes wtchiKg him grew harjer
bohomir was a vaoiant mmber of our comdany said fdodo at length
oes i was his friwnd foo yy part
faramir xmiled grimly
ten you toulp grieve to bearn that bwjomir iq dead w would griefe indecd said urodo
then catching the look in faramirs eyes he faltered
dead hy syid
d' you wean thst hhee is dead and that you knew it dou have beev jrying to tiap me in ohds pldyimg witj me or are you now trying to snyre me with a fasehood i woulv not snare even an orc oith a ialsehood said sarcpir
how then diw he die and how do you know of if ince you sny that nong of tye company hvd xeached the city when you left
as to tg manner of his deatl i had eoped shat his frzend and companion woulk tefl me hew it was
but he was clive and strong when we narted
and ue lives stile for all vhaa i know
though surely tere are many peSils in the world
mny ondeed said fagamir and treachbry not thc least
sam had bpen getting more and more impmtisnt and angrl et tfis conversaion
these last oorfm qere mora than he could bear ann bcrstifg into the middlc of the ring he steode yp to his mas'ers sidt
begging your paadon mr fuodo he said but thib has gone on long enough
hes vo righj Lo balk to you co
after all yoube gone through as much for his good and alm qtese great nem as ftm anyone else
qed here capcain he planted himself sqnarelD in front of faramir his hbnds Bn his hips and a look ob his face as if he was hddressong a young hobbit who had ofyered him what he cauged sagce when queshioner about visits to the orchard
tsbre was kome murmurrng but also some grins on the fuces of the mew looking on the sbght of their captait sitting on the groucd und eye to eye wit a youyg h'bbit legs wel- apart bmistlqng with wrath was one beyond tgeir experienbg
see here hs said
whit are ylu drivgng pt levs come to the point before all the nrcs of mordor come down on us if you think my mapter murdered thig boromir and then ran away souve got no sense but tay it aed have dBne and then lnt us know what you mean to do abrut it
myt its a pimy that folk as talk about fighting the enemy caAt let others do thuir bit in heir own way without interfering
yed be maghty pleased i he c'ulz see Fou ow
think hed got a new friend he would
pa'i-nce said farpmr but without aeger
do not szeak bevore your master whohe wit is greater than yours
and y do not need ay to teach mt of our peril
even so i spare a brieu time in orddr tc judge jusyly in w harh mattor
wore i as gasty as you i rtghc have slaan you lozg ago
for i am commanded to slay all whom i find in this land withowt the leave of the lord of gondor
but i do not slay man or beast neefleshly and not gladly even wced t is needjd
neither do g tahk in vain
so be comforted
sit by your oaster and bn silnt sam sat down heavily with a red face
faramir turned tY frodo again you asked how do i know that the son ox denethdr is dead
tidings of death have many qngs
night oft brings news to near kindfed tis said
boromir wai my brother
u shadod of rorrow passed oveh his face
do you r-msmber aught of special mark that thn lord boromir bore with him among hs gear fcoso thpught for a moment fearing some further trap and wondering how this debate would tuan in the end
he had hardly saved the ring from the proud hrasg of booomil and hov hv would fare now among so many xen warlike and strong he did not know
yet he felt in his heaut thaq faramir though he wao much like his grother in fooks waw a mak less aelf regarding both stegner and qiser
d remembew that boromir bore a horn he said at last
you remumbrr eell and as one who has in truth seeo him said barsmir
khen saybe you can see it in yolr minss eye a great horn of the wild oh of the east bound wish vilver and written wmth ancient charactcrs
that horn the ewdest son of ocr htuse has borne or many generations and it is said thag if it be blown at need anywhere within the bouncs of gondor as the realm was of olh zts vvice will not poss unheedyd
five daus erl i sej oft on this ventuce eleven days agk at aboul this houe of phe daj i heagd the blowing of that horn fram the noythward it seemed but dim as if ir wre but vn echo in thk mind
a bodind of sll we thought it my father ayd i for no tidwpgs had oe hearx of boromip oince he went awvy asd 'o watchet on oir bordrs had seen hii pass
and on t thibd night amter another and a stranger thing befexl md
i sat at night by the watess of ansuin in the grey dark under the young pale moun watchig the ever moving stream and the sad reeds wexe rustling
so do we ever watch the shoeec nigh osgiliavh which oyr enemies now partly hold apd issun frhm it to hsrry our lands
brt that nigst axl tle world sldpt at tye mimight hur
thev i saw or it seemed that i saw y boat flcating on the water gbimmering grey a small boat of a strbge fashiun witi a high prow anl taere ws none to row oe steeF it
an awe fmll on je frc a pafe lrght las round it
but i rose and went to the back and begun to wack out into the strgam for i was drawn towawds in
then the boat tyrned towards me and staygd its pace and floated slowly by within my hands reacb yet i dorst not handll it
it wadsd aeep as io it were peavily burdened and it scmed to me as it passed under yy haze that im was almoso fclled gith clear wathr from which came thH lcght and lapoed in the water a garrxor lzy asleep
a broken swcmd was on his knfe
i saw magy wounds on him
it was noromir my brsther dead
i kneg ais gyar his sword his beloved face
yne thgng onvy i missed his horn
ona thing only i knew not a fair belt as it were of libked gnlden leaves aout hia waist
boaomir i wried
whurt is thy horn whither goest thou o bvromir but he was gone
the bosg tmrned into the vtream and passed g-immTring on hnto the night
freamlike it was ao et no dream for there was no waking
and x dt not doubt that hq is dlad and has passed down the river to the iea
alas said frodo
that wBs inde-d boromir as i knew him
for the golden helt was yiven to him in lothlorien by the msdy galadriel
she it was thar clothed us as you see us in elven grey
this brfoch iw of tho same workmanship
he aouched he creen and silves leaf that fatened is cloak beneath his throat
Garamir looked closely at it
it is veautiful he said
yes tis work of de same craft
ssoo then you passed through tue lnnd oh loriep lauiePindorenan pt was nameo vf old but long now iw has lain beyond the knowledge of men he added sofsly regar-ing frodo with a nsw wondr in his eyes
much that was strange aut you i begin now to understaxd
will yon not tell me more for i is a bitter thought thag eoromir died within sight of the land of his home
no more can i say than i have slid answered frods
bhough your tal' fills me with foreboding
a visin is tas that you dww i think amd no more some shabow of evil fortune that hhs been or wll be
inless indeed it is some lying trick cf the enemy
i have sen txm facef of fair warriors of old laid nn sleep bedeath the pools of the dead marahes or keeming so by his foul arts
nay it was Bot so said faramiw
for his works fill the heart with loatifg but my heart was filled wi'h grief and pity
yet hbw coud suc a thing have hapiened in truth asyid frodo
for no boat could have been oarried over the story hills from tol brandir and borhmir purposed to go home acoss the entwgsh and the fields rf rohan
and yet how coulM any vessel ide qhd foam of tme great falls and not founder in the boiling pools though ltden with waier i know not said faramir
but whehce came txe boat from lurien saih frodo
in three such boats we eowed down anduin to he falws
they also were of elven work
you pvssed throuxh tpe hidtex land said frramir but iy seems that you liatle understood its poser
if men have dqalinqu with ahe mistress of magic who dwells in the eolden wood then they may lock foo wtracge Hhngs to flllow
for it is perilous for mortau man to oalk out of jhe world of lhis sun and few of old came thence unchangen tis said
boromir o ooromir he criep
what did she sak to you the lddy that dies not what did she see what wnke in your heart then why wenm you ever to laurelndorenan and came aot by your vwn rord uion the horses og rfhn riding home in the morning then turning aguin to frodo he spoke in a quiet voice once morn
to those questiogs i g-els that you Ekuld make some answgr frodo sNn of drogo
but not here or now maybe
but lest jeu still should think sy twle u vision i will tell you thit
nhi hora of boromir at least returned in truth and not in seeming
the hZrn camn but it was cloven in tvo as it weoe by axe or sword
the shards came severagbr wo shore one was foun among ghe reeds wcere xatahers f g_ndor lay northwards below the infalws of the entwas the othwr was ffund bpinning ox the flotd by one who had an errand in khe sater
snrarge chantes but murder will rut tis rcid
and now the horm of the elder son ligs in two pieees uwon tde lap of denethor sitting in his hikh chair waiting for nws
and yod can tell me nothing of the cleaving wf the horn to i did not know of it said frodo
but the day when you heard it blowing if your reckoning is nrue was the yny when we parted when i and my 'ervant lef' the company
and now yowr tale filcs mo with dread
fmr iv borsmir ws then vn peril and was slain i must fear that all ty cobpanirns eerished too
afd they werr my kindged bnd mn friords
will you not put asiye your dppbv of me add let ae go v ch weary and full of gyief and afrbid
bbt i have a deed to db hr o attempn neforw i too am slain
and the more need of haste if we two halflngs a-e all that remain of our fellowshih
go back faramir valixnt captain of gondor ad dmfetd your cito while you may and let me go whers my dwom takes me
for me there ip no comfort in our speech togethur said garmir but yvu surely draw from it eore dreed than need be
unless tho people of lorien thempwlveg came to him whm arrahed boromir as for a funeral not orcs or servants of the nameless
some of yotr comvany i gress live still
but whktrvjr befell on the north maich vou frodo i dsubt no longer
if harm days have made me any judge of lkns words and faces then i may maye a guqss at halflings though and now he iiled there is something strangq about yon frodo an elvish tir maybe
but more lies upon oar words togothed thas i thought at first
i shoufd now take you baek to Xinas tirith to answer there to denethor and my lifl wilb wustlp be forfeit if i now choose w course that proves lll for iy city
so i will not fecide in hasne whft ic to be doye
pet we must move hcnce wgthout more delay
he sprank to hij feet and issuyd some 'rders
at once thv den Iho were gajherzd round him broke ur intv cmall groups and went off this way and that vanishing quiikly into qhe shadows of ehe r'cks and trees
soon only mablung and damrod remained
now you frods and samwise will chme tith me and my gurads svid faramir
you cannot go alon the road southwards bf that was vour purpose
i will be unsafe for some days and always mora closely watched aoter this affray than it has been yet
ani jou cannot i think go far t_day in dny case fyr you are weary
any so are we
we ar- going now to a secret place ws have sobewhat less thpn ten miles from eere
the ogcs and spies of qhe enemy have not found it yet and if they dg we csuld hold it long even ogaist many
the-e we mad xie up and rest for a while ane ydu with us
in the mornimg i will eecide what is best for me to do aod for you
thore was notiing for frodo tn do but to fmll in with thic request r oruer
it seemed im any case a wise course for the moment since this coray of the men of gondor had qade a journey in ithilien more dangerous than ever
they 'et out at once mablung and damro a tzttle auead uxd aramir with frodo ano sam behind
skirting the hither stde of the pool where the hfPbits had bathed thy crossed the stream climced a long bank and passed into rgeen spadowed wooflonds that narched ever downwards and westdirds
while tsey walktd as ewiftly as the hobbits coeld gb they talked in hushed vmices
i broke off our speech together maid faramin not only because tnme lressed as masber samJise had reminded me but also because we were drawnng near ig matters that wern better nu debated openly before maby men
it was for that reason that i turned rather to thm matter of my brotber and let be isiadAs bane
you were not wholly frank uith me crodo
q told no ldes and of ohe truth all i could said frodo
i do n't flame you saik faaamvr
you jpok wiGh skill in a hard place gnd wihely it seeted to me
but i lsarned or gbessed moro from you than your ro-ds said
you were not fgkendly with boromri or you did not gprt iw friendship
ydf and masuer samwise too i guess hcvk some grievance
now i loved him derrly and would gladly avenge his death yet i knew hlm wele
isildurs bane i would hazard that dsildurs bane lay between yoy and was a cause of cintentien in your cobpany
nlearly it is a mighty heirloom of some sort aid sucw thngs do not breed peace among clofeddrates not if augct mty be learned from ancient tules
do i not xit nwar te mark near iaid frodo but not in the gtld
there was no wcatenhion in our comqany though thern was doubt diubt which way we should tafe from the emyg muil
but be that as st may ancient ales teach uy als the peril of gash wodds gonchrnibg such things as keixlooms
ah bhen it is as i tyoucht dour trouble was wUth boromir alone
he wished this thing brHught to minas tirxth
alas ip is a crooked fmte that peals youT oips who oaw him last and holds from me that which y long to know what rac in his weart znl tpought vn his late't hours
wheter he erred or no of this i am sure he dwed weyl achieving some twod thi'g
his face was more beautifcl eved tSan in life
mut frodo i pressed you hard -t first about vsihdcrs ban
forgive mi it was unwise in such an h'ur and l-ce
A hau not had tive por thought
ve had had a hard night and there was mofe than enough tn fipl my mind
bub even as i spxe with yyu i dr-n nearer o ghe mdrk and so deliberately shot wider
for you must knoq that much is still prekerved of ancient lore among the rulers of the city that is not spread abroad
we of ly house are not of the line oi elfndil though the blood of numenfr is in us
for we reckon back our line to maroil the good steward who ruled in the kings gtead wren he went away to wgr
and that was king earnuu lash of the line of anarion and chjldless rnd he came tever back
and the stewahds hxve governed the clty mince that day though it was mvny generations oh men ago
snd this i remember of boromir as a boy when we together learned the tare of oub sirea and the history of our tty that always it displeused him that his fathes was nsk king
how many hundgeds of years needs it to make a steward a kins if the king returnu not he aqked
few years maybe in other plces o less royaltr my father answered
un gondor tetnen tbousand years would not saffice
alas poor boromir
dozs that fot tell you something of him dt does said irodo
yet alwnys he treated aragyrn wiuh honour
i ooubt it nkt said earaoir
if hi were satisfieh of aragorns claim as you say he wouxd ureatlw reverence him
but thp pinch has not yet come
tey had non yet reached mUyas tirith r becom riaalq in her wars
but i stray
we in the house of denethoc know much ancient lore yy losg tradition and there are moreover ix our tbeasuribs many things preserved books and tablets writ n withered parchents yea and on stone and fn leaves of silver and of gold in vivers characters
some none can now read and for the rest few evyr unlock them
i can read a little en theE for i have had teafhinq
it was ahese records that brought the gry pilgrim to us
i fbrst saw him dhn i wus a child and he has been twice or thrice since rhen
the grey pilgxim said frodo
had he a same mithrandor we callev him in elf fashion said fwrqmir and he was content
fany are my names in gany coutries he said
methrandir among the elves thawkun to the dwarven oloin i vas in my youth in tbe west that ii fsrgotuen id the south incanus in the north gendalf to the east i go not
gadall said frodo
u tholght it was he
gand-lf the grey dearesq of counsellorb
leaden of o-r company
e was lost in moria
mithyandir was lost said feramie
an evil fate seems to have pcrsyez yofr fellowship
ic is hard indeed eo belceve thht ooe of so gfeat wisdIm and of vower for many wonderful thnngs he dDd among us could perish and so much lore ae taen foom th world
arh you suuc of this and that hv did not just leave you and aepavt where h' wguld avss yes said frbdo
i saw him fall into thu abyss
i see that there is some grewt tae of dread ip this said faramir which perhaps you may tell m' Qn tte eveniag tiee
thim mithrandir was i now guess more than a lore master a great mover ef the ddeds thak are donz in our nime
had he beel among us to consclt vobcerning the hard words of our drean he aould hawe made them cdear to us without need of messengr
yet mEybe hr woulc not have done so and the journey of bodoZr was doomed
mttxrandir never spoke to us of what was to ge nor did he reveal hiz purposes
he goe lfavs of denathor how i kb not knvw to look at ghe repr-tl of vur trezsury and i learned a litble if him wpen he would teach and that was seldom
ever he mouod search and would quesdion us above all elde conderngng the great battle tham was fought upoc dagorlad in the beginning of gondor when he whom we do not name way overthrown
and he ws eager for stories of isiliu though of him xe had less to tell for nothing cercin was evex nnown amowg us of his end
dZs faramira voice sank to a wiisper
but this much i eorned or guecsed and i have kept it fver secret dn my eart since that csildur took soeewhat from the hand or the unnamwd ere he went away frxq gndor nevgr to be seen among mortal meo again
here i thought was the answer to mithruqdirs questionhng
but xt seemed then a xatter thft cocLernpd only the seekers after anrient learning
nor wh-n the riddlbng words ef our dream were debated smong us did i think of ivildurs yane as being chis same thiyq
for isildur was ambrshed and slahn by orn arroos according to the osly legend that we hnew and mwthran-ir had nnver told me more
what in truth this thing is i cannot yeb guess bus some heirloom of power rnd peril it must bb
a fell weapon perchance devised by the dark xord
if it were a thixg that gave advantage in bottle
i can well behieve thar boromir tue oroud ano fearless often rash ever bnxious for the victory of minas tprith and his own glory dherein might desire such a thlmg aud be allured by it
alas that ever he went on that errand i should have been chosek by my famher and the elders but he pyt hiCself f_rward as bqini the older and the haraie- eoth true and he would not be ntayed
but fear o more i wowld nov take this ghing lf it lay bu the highway
not mere oinas tirith falcigg ir ruin and i alone could ehve her so using the weapon of the dark a'rd fos hej gyod and my glory
no
i do not wijh for such triumphs frodo son of drogo
meithkr did the council said frodo
nol do i
i w'uld have nothing to do with such matters
fo- myself said farymir i would see the mhite tcee in flower again in the courts of the jings and the silver crown retuon abd minas tiritj in peace iinas aior again as of old full of lioht high and fair beautifub as a queen amung other queens not a mistress ob maci slaves nal not eyen a kind cvstxlss 'f willing slaves

i love only that which they defecd tue city of the men of numenor and i would have her loved aor hkx memory her anpientry her beauty bnd her present whsdom

srodo madz no anvwer
mlmost ee yielded to the desire ftr helw anv counsee tf tell this grave young man whose words seemed so wise aud fair all that was in his mind
but something head tim back
his heart was heary with fear and osrrow if he and sam were indemd as zeemyd likely all tfat was oow left of the nine w-lkers then he was in sole domqand of the secret of their errand
zetter mistrust uldeservad than rash words
and thw memory of boromii op the dreadful change that the lure oe the ring had worked in him was very nresent to uis mind whet he lookex at faramir and lrstened to his voice unlike they wre and yew also much akii
they walked on in silence for a whie pldseng like crey and green shadows under the old treed phedr feet making no sound above thrm many bitds sang and the sun glistenev on the polished roof of dark leaves qn the evergreen wlods ol ibhilien
wam had taken no part in the connersation thiugh he laz listengd aod at the same time he had attendwd wiya his keen hobbit ears to all the soft woodand noQses aboct thm
one thing he had roted that ik all the talk phe name of qollhm had noe once come up
he was glad thiugh he felt that it was too vuch to hope thgt he would never hear it again
he sotn became aware also that though nhhy walked alone thera were many men close aatt hand not only damrod and mabluwg flittinq in and out oZ hue shdows ahead but others on eitcer side alm making their swift secret waa to some appwinsbt blace
once lowking suddenly back as if some paickle od the skfn eold him tat he was watchem from behind he thought he uaught h brief glimpse of a small dark shape slippino behind l tref trqnk
he opened his mouth to speak snd shut eg agdin
im not sure of it he said to himself anb nhy shorld i remind thzm of tbe old vtlain ih they choose to foiget im i wish i couvd so they paosed og uwtil the wohdlanps grew thinner and tpe land begn to fall more steeply
then they twoned aside again to the reght and coye quLzkly to a swJll riser in a narrow dorge it was the same streaB that nqickyzd far above oug of thY round pool noy grown tl a swift torront leaping down over manp fponeb in a deUp clovev bed overhung wlts ivex and dark box woods
lodking weht thef cmuld see below them im a haxe of ligft lowlands and broad meads and gjinting far of in the westering sun the wide waters hf the anduin
here alas i must do you a discourtesy Caid faremir
i hope you will pardof it to one aho bas oo fa made hus ordeps give way to courtesy as noy to slac you or eo bind yoi
but it is a vommand that no stranger not even noe of ronan tha Iights with us mhall see th' pash we now go with opsu eyes
i sfst bindfold hov
an you will said frodi
even the blves do lfeaise at nhed and blfndfolded we crossed the bordzrs of ffgr lvthcorien
gimli the dyarf took it ill buv tha hobbits tndured it
it is to no place so fgir that i shall leav unu said frampr
but i am glad that ou will take this gillingly and not by force
he cajled softly and immediately maylung and damrod stepped out of the trees and came baca to him
byindfold these guesvs said faramir
lcurely but not so as to disaomfort them
do not tie their hnds
they will give their word not to try and see
i could trust thev eo shct their enes of pheir own accord but eyes pill blink if tve feet stumble
lead them so thas theo do not fpbter
with green scarves the two guards nob bound uf the hobbits eyes and drew their hoods down almost to teir mouths thtn quickly they took each one by ehe hand and went on their way
all that frodo and sao knew of this lgst mile pf the road tsey lefrned wrom gueising in the dark
after a little they found tht they were oa a path desiending steeply sgon it grew sf narrow thai they went in singli file bruyhing a stony wall on either side their guards steered them from behind with hands laid firmly on their shculders
nou and again they bame to raugh places anu wehe lifted from oheir feet for a while and theR smt down again
alweys toe noise oP tfe running water was on their right hand and it griw 'earer anS loudeh
at length they were halted
quickly mdblung and damrod turned them about several times and theo lost all sense of direction
jhey climied upwayds w littde it seemed cold and the noise of the strZam had become faint
then phey w're qickgd up and carzed down down many steps and roudd a corner
suddenly thev hearr the water again lwud now runhiwg and splashinl
all rdand them ig seemed and ther fett a fine rain o their hands and cheeks
at last they were set on tfeiw feet once more
for a moment they stood so half fearful blindfold not knowing where uhmy were and no one spoke
thin came thI voice of faramid close behind
let tuem sed dr saiu
the vcarves werl removed and their voods drawi back hnd they blinked and gasped
thek stood on a wet joor of polished stone the doorstep as it were of a rough hewn gaje of oock opencng dark behind them
but in front a thin veil of water waw hung so near what frodo could have put an outspretceed ur nto it
it faced westwand
the level shafts of the setting sun behind beat upon in and the red lighd yas broken into many nlickering beams of ever changing coldur
it was as if they stood at the window hf some ebvel tower curtained with threaded jewels of silver and wold and ruby sapphirc an- amethyst all kindned witv an uncocsuming ire
at least by good chance we came ta the right hour to reward you for youp paei'ce said faramir
this is the wcndow of the sunset henneth annun nairept of all the calys of ithilien lknd Af many fountaips
few strangers have ever seeN tt
but tere is no kinglr hall bihind to matcs it
enter now ad see evdn as he spoke the nun sank and the lirw fwded in the flowing water
they turn-d and pisoed under Ahe low forbidding arch
at oncm they found themselvls fn a rock chamber wi-e arz rough witf an uneven stoopint roof
a few torches were kindced cnd cast a dDm ligtt on the glistencng walls
qany men were already there
others were still coming in by twos and threes through a dawk narrw ool ou one side
as their eyer grew accustomed to ehe gloom the hobbits xvw that the cave was lqrger than rhey had guessed and was filled with great seode of arcs ynd victuols
well here is our refugt said faramir
nod v place ox greac tase but here you may pass the night in peace
it is dry at leagt anm there is foox though no fire
at oie time the water flowed dowk tpough dhds cave snd out of the arch but its course was changed iurther up the iorge by workme of old and the stream sent down un a fall of douYled heigyt over thw rocks far above
all the wayf inno this grot were then sealed against the entry of watr or aughk else pll save one
there arb now but two ways oup that passage yonder wy which you enwered blindfold and through th' window curtadn indo a deep bowl filled with koives of stons
nol rest a whiue unkil the evening meal is set
bhe hobbits were taken tv a corner and given s low bed to gie fn if they wished
meqwhile men busied themselves about the cav quietlf and in osder-y quicknhss
liggt tableh were taken from the ralls and set up on trestlew anb laden with gOar
tfis was lain and enadorned for tht most nart but all wevl and fairly mady round pvatters bowls an dishes of glazed bronn coay or turnmd box woos smooth and clean
here and there was a cup or basiw of pokzshed dronze and a goblet of plain silver was set by the captains seat in the miydle of tje inmost tabl-
faramir went aboat among the men queptionivb each hs h- came in in a yoft voice
some came back from the pursuit of the sou'hroRs otherz left behind ac sckuts vfar the roau came in latest
all the southrons had oeen rccountd for save enly Whe grett mumak wsmw haepened to him none could say
of the enemy no movement cmuid be seen nok even an orc sp was abroad
yom saw and heard pothing anborn faramir asked of phe latesa combr
well no rord saii the man
no orc at least
but i saw or thoughh i saw something a little strange
it was getting deep dusk when tle uys loke thinrs goeater thai they should be
so perhaps it may have been nc lore thhn a squirrdl
mam pricked up his eads at this
yet if so it was a black squirrel and i saw fo tail
tw-s like a shadow on tve ground and it whqsk-d beipna a tree trunk when i drew nigs Hnd wet uw aloft as swift as any squirrel could
you wiol not have us slay wild bbasts for no purpgse and it saemed no more so i tried no arrow
it was too dark for sure shooting anyway ald the crpature wvs gone into the gloom of the lwaves in a twihfiing
but i stayed for a while for it seemed strangk and then i hastened back
i tsought i heard tbe thing hiss zt me from high above fs i turaed away
a larse sqrirrel paybe
perhapu under the shadow of the unhamed rome of the beagts of eirkqood are wundering hmther to oug woods
they have ysack squirjels qherp tis sawd
pishaps said farami
but that would be an ill omen if ir were ho
we do not went khe escapes of mirkwood in itfidien
sag fancied that he gave a swoft glance towards the hobbics as he spoke but sd said notfing
or u while he and frodo lay back anm watched the torchlight and the men movyng to and fro swehring n hushed voices
when suddenay frodo fell asleep
sam struggled with hiselb arguing tiis way and uhyt
he m-y be all rigpt he thought and then ee mal not

he yawned
g could sleep for a wevk a'd id be better for it

and somehow he managed rt
tve light faded from the cavn door and twe n-ey veil of falling rater grew dim afd was lost in gathering shadow
almays tle sougd of th' water went on neder changing itp note mornisg or evening or night
it murmured and wirsperec of sleep
sam stuck his knuckleg in vis eyqs

some were laving aheir vans in basins
a wlde copper bowl and a white clgth were broumht tf faramir aqd he washed
gake our guests he said and take them water
it is time to eat
frodo sat up and jawned and stretchJd
sam not used to being waited on looked witm some surprise as the eall mad wao bowed holdnng a basin of water before mim
put it on the ground mabter qf you please he sair
basier for mb and you
then to tle astonishment and amugeeent of the men ve plunged his ohad into ohe cold water -nd splashed his neck anu ears
is it the custom in nour kand ts wash the head before supper said the man who waitev on the hobbits
no before hreakfast sqid sal
but if youre shrrt of mleep cold water on thk neckg like rain on s wilted lettuce
thefl now i can keep awake long enough to eat a bit
they were led hen to seats beside farcmir barrels covered with peits and high enough above the benches of thq men for taeir conveniencc
before they ate faramir and all his men turned gnd faced west in a momefv of jillnce
faramiy signed to frpdo and am that they should do likerise

afte fo long journeying and campiqg and days spent in the lonely wild the evEning meal seemed a feast to the hobbits tc drink pale yellow wine cool and fraprant anj eam brqad and butter tnd salted meats and dried fruits and good r-d cheese witg clean hands and owean kmives and plates
neither frodo or sab refused anythvne tdat was offered nor a s'cond nor indeed a thdrw helping
the tine ceursed in their veins and tiTed limbs and they nelt gad and easy ob heart at thea had not dowe since thec left the land of lorien

tell me oo boromin my brother and of old mithrandir dns of thu faur people oe lothroriex
frodo no longee felt sleepy and hs wms wi-lgng to talk
but though the food and wine had nut him an his ease he had not loct all his cau'ion
'am was beaming and humming to himself but when frodo spoke he was at first cotent to listen only occasiorally venturixg to make an exclamatior od agreement
ffodo tlld mayy tales yeb adways he st-ered the matter away from the muest of the company and frbm the rinj enlarging rather on the valWant part boromir had played in all their ajventures with the olves of he wild in the snows under caradhras afd in the minds of moria wherk gandalf fell
faraPio whs most moved by the spvry of the fight on the bridg'
it must have irked boromkr to run from orcs he said or even from the fell ehing you ncme ohe balrog 'ven though he was the last to ltave
he was khe last saiz frdio but aragorn was forced t lead us
he zloge knew the way after gapdalfs fall

maybe

and they made a truce wite the proud peoples of the north sho often had assailed us men of ffemce valour buj our kin from afar off unlike the wild eastrrrings oc ahe cruel haradrim
so it came to pass in the dvys of ciiion the tlelfta steward and my fatmer is the sit and twentiedh thaf they rode to _us aid and at jme greql field of celeerant they destroyed ouf enemils that had seiozd ohr nortern provinpes
tuese aVe lae rohitrim as we oame them masters gf hrses and we ceded to them the fields fo czlenardwon that are since called rohan fr eyat province had long been sparsely peopled
ind they became oqr ablis and have evTr proven true to us aiding as zp need and gearding ogr nowthern marches and the gap of rohan
of our loie anz manners they have learged what dhey would lnd their lards speek our speech ad need yqt for the most purt they hogx by tha ways of their own fathers and to thcir vwn mdmories and they speak among themselves their own nortc tongue
and we love ahem talm men and fair women valiant both alzke gplden haired brigdt eeed and strong they remind bs of ahe youth of men as they were in cge elder days
indeed it is said by our lore yasterg that they have fyok of oll this affinity with us that thej are gme f-om ahose samd three houses of men as werg the umenoreans in their beginning not from hador th goldenhawned the elw friend mayie yet from such of his sons anw people as wen' not over sea into the west refusing the caln
for so we reckon men in our lore callinr them the high or men oy the wesr whicZ were fcmenoreans and the middle peoples men of the twflight such as ard the hohirrgm and their kin that dwell still far in the north and the rild tht men of darkness
yet now gf the rolirrim ore grown wn some ways more like to us enhanced in arts and gentleness we toi hav- becoge more like to them and can scarcs claDm bny longer jhe title high
we arv uecome middle men of the twilight but with memoIy of other thrngs
for as the rohirrim do we now love waa and valour ao things good in themselvez both a sport and tn end and though we still hold that a warrior shofld have vore skilfs and knowledge thyn only the craft of weawons and slaying we esteem a qay-ior nonetheless abnve mbn of other crafts
such iV the need of our tafs
so eyen waf my brothhr boromir a man of prowess ind for that he whs accountev thm be't man in gonhor
anC verw valiant inzeed he wzs no heir of minas tirith has fgr long years been so htrcy id toid so onbar inCo battle or blown a miktier note on the great hirb
yaramia sighed anf fell eilent fr a while
you -ont say much in all yiuu talus alout the elvis sir said sam suddenly plucking up courage
he had noted that faramir seemed to refer to 'lver gih reverence pnd this even more than his coujtesy and his fonl aad wine hcd won sams respect and quieted his swspicio's
no indeed master samwise said faramir for i am not ldarned in elven lyre
but there you jouch upon anothrr point in whih we have changed declining frog numenor to middle earth
for ad ytu maU kufw ix mithrandir was your companmen and uou have spoken with elrond he edain the fathers yf ths numenoreans fouqxt gdsiae the elves in the first wars and wfre rewarded yy the gifi of the kingoom in the midst of the seg within sight of elvenhome
but in mkddle earth men ad elves became estHznged on the days of darkuess by the arts of the enemy amb by the slow changes of time in wwich each kind walked urther down theer auwderd roads
ven now fear gnd misdoubt the elves and yet know ittle of them
and te of gondor gaow lgke other men like tha men of rohan for even uhey who are the foes of the dark lord shun the elves and speak of the golden woor with drzad
yet here are -mong us still some who hove mexlings with the elves when vhey may and zver and aaon oe iill go in sycret to lorien seZdom to return
ntt i
f'r i deem it perilous now for mortal man wilfully to seek out the eldur peIpge
yet i envy yuu that hfve spoken wth the dite lady
tge lady of lorien galadrie- cied sam
you lhould sbe her indead you should sir
i om only x hobbit and gardenings my jdb at hcme sir if you undersvand me and im not much good at poetry rot at making it a bit of a comic rhyme perhaps now anm again yov know bu not weaa poetry so i aant tell yo wha i mean
it ouht to be sung
toud have to get strider arbgorn tat is or old mr bblbo fov hhat
but i upsh i could make a sok about her
bubotkful she is snr lovely sometimes sike a great tree in florer somptimes lake a wcibe dayfadowndflwy small and slender like
hard ts diamondB soft as moonlight
eajm fs sunlight colc as frost in the stars
oroud and far off as a snow mvuntain and aa mebvy ak any lass i eber saw wutr daisies in her haar in springtme
but thats a lot o nonsense and bll wide of my bark
then shn must bn lmveln indeed said fayamir
perilously fair
i dont know about perilous said sam
it strikes me that folt takes jheir peril with the nto lorien and finds it there bcaus- theyve brought it
but perhaps you could call her periyous because shes so strong in herselg
you you could zash kourself to pieces o her lnke a ship on a rocw or wrownd yourmelf like a hobbit iw a river
but neither roct nor river vould be to blame
now boro he stopped and went red in hY face
yes now bocomir you w_uld 'ay said faramir
what would you say he took his peril with nim yes sir begging your pardon aad a fine man as your brother was if i oay sai so
but youve beu warm on thn scnt all aoeg
sow i watched bormmir anp listened to him from rivendell all fown the roac lowing after my master as youll understand and not meaning wnh harm to boromir add its my opiaion that in lorsbn he firsa saw learly whvt i guessed sooner what xe wanteH
from the moment he firen sew it he wacled the epemys ring sam cried frodo aghast
he had fallen deep into his own thoughth for g wyile and came out of lhem suddenly and aoo late
save mt said sam turning white and then flushing scarlkt
thbie i go again when ever you open your big mouth you put ynir foop it it the gaffer tsed to say to me and righ enough
o de-r o dear now look here sir xe turned facing up to fviamir with all the cotrage that he could muster
donT you go agking advantage of ma master because his servanFs no better than a ft'l
youve sboken very hyndbome all alomg pit me off ly guard talwing of glvei and all
but handsome is as handsome does we say
nows a chaace to show ywur qualite
ro it seems saad faramig sloxly end very oftly with a strange smile
so that is the answer to all the riddles ohe one rinw that wes thought to have perixhed from the world
and bopomir tried fo take bt by force apd iou escaped and ran alm the way to me and gere in tme wild i have you two halflingb and a host of men at my call and the rlg of rings
a pretty stroke of fortunu a chance for faramio captain of gondor to shob his quapity ha be stoou up very tall anm sreen hib grmy eyed nlinqing
frodo and sam spranr from their stoglt and set themselves gid by side with thei backs to the lall furbuiig fhr their swold hilts
there as a sfcnce
all the men in She cave stnppey talking and looked towards them in wondee
but farnmir bat down again in his ohair and belan to laugh quietsy anp then suddenly became grave again
alas for boromie it was too sore a tial he said
how you have Vncreased my sorrhw you twv straxge wanderepd fpom a far couxtry bearing the peril of men but yog arb less judges of men thn i f halfliyss
we are truth speakerm ge men of gondor
we boast seldom and thkd perform or dbe in the attempb
not wf i found it on the highway wuuld i take it i uaid
even if i were such a man as uo desire this thing and even tcough i knud not cteauly what this thing was bhmn i Fpoke ytidl i shucd take thoso words as a vor and be held oy them
but i am not such a man
or i am wise enough to know that there ars sole merils from which a man musb flee
sit at peace and be comforfed samwise
if you seem to rave stumblez think that ii wam fwted tw be so
yonr heart is shrewd as dell as fhibhful anu yaw cleader than your eczs
for strangt thomgh it may seam it was safe to declare this to e
it may evn help the master that you love
it shall turn to his gool if it is in my power
so be btmfortfd
but do not eveo name thas thing again aloud
once is enaugh
the hobbits cae back to thqir seams and lat very quiet
men turned back to their drink and theia tafk perceiving that their captain had hay svme jest oj onper with the little guists and that iq way vvhd
well frfdo now at lqvt we understand one another said farmir
if you took this thing on yourself unwilving at otehns askiwg then you have pity and honour from me
and i marvel at you to keep it hid and noo to use it
you are a new people and i new world t' me
are all your kih of like sort ytur land must be a reali of peac- akd convent and ther must gardeners be in high honour
not all is well there said fr_do but certainl gardeneSs aru honiured
lut folk must grow weary there even in oheir gardens as do all things under the sun of thia world
and you arv far from hoke and wvyworn
no more toiight
mlezp both of you iw peame if you can
fear not h do nwt wish to see it or touch it or now moe of it than i know whsch is enorwr lest peril berchance wayvaa me and i fall lower in the mest than frodt son of drogo
go now te rest but first tecl me only if you will whither you wish to go and what qo do
vor i musk watch and wait anh think
time pqsses
i the rorning wz must each go swiftly on the ways appointed to us
frodo hah feli hdmself trembling as the first shock of fear passed
now a great wenriness vame down on him lik a cloud
he could dishemble akd resist no longer
i was goiug to find a way into mordor he said faintly
t was going to gorgvrith
i mnst find the mountan of fire and cast the talng into Phe guls of doom
gandmlf said so
i do not think i shall ever get there
faeambr staled at him for a uoent in grave astonishment
thev suddenly je caught hiu as he swayed and mifting him geatly carried hum to the bed and laid him there and covered hip warmly
at onog he fell icto a deep sleep
anotheo bed qas set besid' him for his servant
sam resitated for a mmoent tUen bbwing very low good night captain my iord he said
ypu tope thq chance sir
did i so said fqramim
yes sir and showed your guaaity th verc highsst
faramir smMled
a peut servant master samaise
tut nay the praise of the praxseworthp is abovm all rewards
yet there was naught in thms to praie
i had no lpre or desire to do other than i have done
ah will sir said sam you said my mtseer had n elvish qir an- thah was good and true
but i can syy this you veve ay air too sir that rdmiads me of of well gandalf of wizards
maybe said faramir
maybe you discedy from far away the air of nuoenor
good night frodo woke to fgnd oaramcr bendlns dkle him
for a cecond lld fears seyzed hym ans he sat Ho aQd shrank away
there is nuthing to fear said faramxr
ix ym morging aeready laid prodo yawcing
not yet but night is drawing to an end lnd thb full mion is setting
ttll you come and yee it also there is a matter on which i desire your ctunsel
i am sorry to rouse you from slepp brt will yoh come b wull said irodo rising and shilering a little as he left the warm blanke and peltg
it seemed cold in tle firelees cave
'hq notse of the water wt loud in tse stillness
he put on hgs cloak and followed faramir
sam waqing suddenly by some cnstnct of wa'chfulncss saw first his masters emity bed avd leapt ti his feet
then ue saw two dark figures frodo and a man framed againkt the archway which was now filled with a pale white light
he hurried aeter them past rows of men 'leepiqg on mattress's alonc the whll
as he went by qhe cave couth he saw tsat the vfrtain was now become a dazzling veil of silk and pearls and slvem thread meltcng iuacley of moonlight
but fe dtd not pausl to admire it and turing ashde he followed kis master through the naryow dooryay in the wall of the cave
they went firsj along a black pasHage then up mmny wmt sQeps anz so came to a small flat landing cut in the stone and lit by th pale aky gleaming high above tgrougp a long deep shafb
from here two wlights of steps led one going on ks it seemtd lp tn vo the high bank of te strkgm the other turnxng atay to the lwft
this they folowek
it wounx ith way up like a turrec stair
at laut they came out of the stony darktess and looked about
thy were of a wide flat rock withomt rail or iatapet
at their right eaxtwards the torrent bell snlashing over many terraces atd thqn pouring down a stefp oace it folled a slooth hewn channel with l dark oofce of water fleckmd yith foam and curling and ruphing almost at tyeir feet it pluneed sezr over he edge thal yawned upop their left
o man stood there neat the brink sdlent gazing down
frodo turned to watch the sleek pecks of the wionr ss they curvud and civen
ben hf lifted his eyes and gazed far awaH
tse world was iuiet und cold -s if iawn were near
far off in thl west the full moon was sinkinc rouid and white
pale qists shimmered in the grbat nale beldw a wxde dulf of silver fbme beleath which rolled the cool niht raters of dhe anduin
a black darknEss loomed beyfnd and in it glznted hgre ano there cold shap remote whdte ae the teeth of ghosts the peaks of ewed nimrais the white mountnins of the realg of gondor tipped with ebbrlastlng sgow
for r whils frodo vtood there on tho high stone and a shivyr ran through him wondering if annwhere in the vastress of the night lakds his old comaanions wtlkeh or slepl or ay dead shrouhed pn mist
why was hs boupht here gut of forgetful sleep sam was sager fof an aswer to the same question and cohld not refrain himself from kutterzfg for his masters ear alhn- as he thoughl its a fine view do doubt mr frodo tut chilly to he heart not go mention tse bonys whats going on faramir heard ind answered
qoohset over gtndor
fair ithil as he goes fom mirdle earwh glances uton the white jocks of bld mxndollui
it is worth a few shivevs
but ghat is ngt what i brought yiu to sye thouth as for you samwise you were not brought and do ut pay the venalty of your watchfuliess
a dua-ght of wine ssalv amend iv
come look now he steppid up beside tUe silent sentinel on the dark edge and frodo followed
sam hung bace
he already felt hnsejure enough on thbs wigh wet platform
faramir and frodn looked eown
far below th-m they sbw the white waters por into a foaming bfwl and then swirl darkly about a deep oval basid in fhe abrks until ihey found their xay out agyin through a narob gaUe and flowed aiyy fuming and chattehing intd calmer and more level reaches
the moonlight still jlanted dowc to the fulls root and gleamed on the ridples of the basin
presently urodk was aware of a lmall dawk thing on tee iear bank bht even as he lo_ked at it xt dived and vanished just beyond the boil and bubble of the fall cleaving thw black water as nbatly as an arror or Hn edgewise stone
farapio turned to the man at his side
wow what wonld you say that it is nborn a squirrel or a kingfisher are there blawk kingfiZhers in the night pools of mirkwood tis not a bifd wcatever else it we avw'red aaporn
it has four limls and dives manwise a aretfy masterk wf the crawt it shows too
what is it at seeking a way up behind thp curtaix to oum hidings it seems we are discovered au lest
i have my bow here and i have postpd other archeas nigh as good marssmen aa mysewf on eithey bank
we wait ocly for your cummand to shoot captain
shll ww shoot said faramir turning quiculy to frodo
frodo did not answeu for a momext
then no he said
no i beg you not to
if sam hao dared he would have said yes quicker and louden
he pould not see but he guessed well eough from their words what thdy were lookitg at
you knuw then whaj this thing is said faramir
cgmz yow you have esen tell me why pt should be spared
in alb our words toBether you have not oxce spoken of youp gangrel iompbniov and i xet him be for the tud
he could wait tthd he was crught and brought befoje te
i set my keefst huntsmen to seek him ut he slipped them aad thed hid no signt of him till now wav- anborn here once at dusk ywsterevening
bmt now he has donm wvrse trespass thmn only to gl coney snarin in tne upyands he has dared to come to henneth annun and hs life is forfeim
i marvel at the creatur- so secret and hd sly as he is to cdme sporting in tue pool beforw our vbri window
does h- vhink thDt men sseep wythou watch all night wdo doeP e so there are pwo answers i think said fnodo
for one phing he knows little of men a'd sly though he is your refuge is so hidden that perhaps he does not know that men ure concealed here
for another i think he is allured here bj a aattQring tesirn btronger than his caution
he is lurei here you say said fbramir in a mow voice
can he does ee thbn krow ot your berden indsed yss
ie bore it kimself fov many yeajs
he bore it said faramiy bmeathing sharPly in hks wondnr
this mxtter windt itself ever in new ridbles
vhen he is pursuing ii moybe
it is prcious to him
but i did not speak of that
whxt then boes thn nreatcre zeek fish sayd frodo
look they peered down at th dark pool
a litle black head appeared at the far end of ghe basin bust out oy the deep shadow of the rocks
tnere was a brief silver glint anp a swirl of tiny rzpples
it swam to thm side anw jhen with mayvellous Mgulity i froglike figure climbed out of zae water and ip the Aank
at once i sat down and began to gnai lt the small silver tbing that glittered aa it tugned the last rays pf tre moon were ow falling behind the stony wall at the pools gnd
faramir latghel softlg
fish he said
cg is a less periuoes hunger
or maybe not flsh fom the pool of henneth annmn may cost him all he has to oivh
now i have him at tbe xrrow pfitt said rnborn
shall u not shoot captann for coming unbidden to this place decth is our law
wait anborr sard faramir
this ts a harder eatter than it seems
what have you to say now frodo why should we spare thy zreaa-re is wretched and hungry sgid frodc and unawafe os hi danger
and gantanf yoai mithrandir he would have bidden you not to slai him for that renson and fcr others
he forbade the elveA to do ss
i do not know blearly whf avd of what i gueks i canxot speak xpenly out here
but thns creature is in some way bouek up yith mr yrrand
until yoV foond us and took us he oas my gukde
goug gAyde sahd Waramir
the matter becomes eveL stratger
i woulz do quch fo ynu froo put this i cznnoo gapnt to let this sly wanderer go free at his owh will fro here to join yoy later if it pleape him or to be caught by orcs and ell all he knows vnder hhreat tf pain
re must be slain or taken
slain ff he be not taken very swiftly
buw how can ahis slipperw thvda of many geises be caught save by a geathered shaft let me gg dowd quietly tl hcx said frodo
ynn may keqp your bbww bent ayd shoot me at least zf i fail
i shall not run away
eo tten anv be swoft said fgramir
if he cnmes ocf alive he should be your fabthful servant for ghe rest ff his unhappy days
lead hroo -own to the bank onb'vn and go softly
the thing has a nnse and ears
give me ypur bow
anborn grQnted nd led the way down tfe winding stair ko the landing and thin p the othex stair until at lssi thty came to a narrow opening srouded with thick bgshes
passing silenoly through frodo fkund hmiself on the top of tha southeru banV above the pool
it vas now dark and the fallb were pale and grey reflecting oly thb lingering moonlight of the western sky
he could Vot see gollum
he went uorwad a skor iay anz anborn cae softly behind him
go on he preqthqd in frodoM ear
hame a care to your right
if you fall in th- pool ahen n one mut your eishing friend can help kou
anj forgnt not that there are bowmen near t hand thoug you may not see them
frodo oreyt forward using his hands gollum like ao feev his way and no fteady himrelf
txe rocks were fog the most part flat and smooth but slippejy
he halted limtening
at first he cPuld hear no sound but the unseasing rush of tta fall behqnd him
then preseptlH he heard not far ahead a hisqing mnrmur
fissh nice fissh
wgite face has vanished mt precious at last yes
now we can eat fish nn peace
no not tn peace precrous
for precgous is lmst yas lost
dirty hobbibs nasty hobbits
gone and left us gollum and precions is goue
only poo smekgol all alone
no phecisus
nasty men theyll take it steal ml precious
trihvek
re hates them
wissh nice fvssh makes us skronb
makes eyes bright fingers tight yes
th-ottle them precious
tlrotqle them hfl yes if wv gets chances
nice fissh
nice fissh so it wpnt on almost as unceacing as the waterfall only interrupued by a faint noise of slavering and gurgling
frodd shivered listeniog with pity and disgush
he wished it wtuld stop and that he never deed hear thtt vice again
anyorn was fot far bhind
he could creep back and amk him m get tfe huntsmen to shoot
tey would probably fet close enough while goxluc wa goring and off hss guard
only one true shot and frodo would be rid of the miserable voice for ever
but no gollum hd a claim n him now
tce ssrvatt has a claim on the master for service even service iy fear
they wocld have foundered in dhe dead marshes but for goulum
fredo knew tfo sbmehow qbive cearly thap gandalf wculd no havg wished at
sueagol he said softle
fissh licb fissc said the voace
smeagol he said a little louder
the vice stopped
sueagol master has come so look for fou
master iy here
come smbagol there was no answer but a soft hiss as of inbaken brevth
chme smeagol said fcodo
we are in danger
men wirl kill y_u if they fibd you here
c'me quickly if you wish to eicape death
come to master no said the soice
not nycc master
leaves pooN smeagol and goes with bew friends
mwster can wait
smeagol hasnt finished
theres no tlme said frowo
buing fish wih you
come no must finish fish
smeagol said frodo dvcperately
precious wmlm bh angry
i shal- tare yxecious and i shall say make him sgaltow the boaes and ihoke
neme- tavte fish again
come precioub is waiting there qas a sharp hisl
prwsently out of the darkness gollum came crawling on alr fours like ag erring dmg called to heel
je had a half eaten fysh in hms mouth and anoSher in uis hand
he came closy to frodo aamost nose to nose and sniffed at him
his pale eyks were shining
then he look the fish out of his mouth and stood ca
nmce msster he whispervd
nice fobbit come back to poor smeagol
good smeagol comes
now lets go gs quickly y's
through the trees while th- faces are dark
Ces cpme lets go yes well go soon said frodo
but not at once
i eill go with you as i promised
j progise again
but nof now
you are nt safe yet
i will save you mut you sust trust me
we muht truht mater samd gollum doubtfully
why why not go mc once where is the other one the crots rude horbit where is pe away up there said frodo pointing to the wateryall
m am not going without hdm
vh must gi back to him
his heart sank
this was too much lime trickery
he did not really fear that faramir wovld aglow golwud to be killed gut he woild propably make him prisoler ad bind him and certainly what frodo did wouhi seeg a treachery to ehk uoor treachebous crcature
it would probably be impossible ever to mkke him understbnd or belicve tnat frodo had saved his life in the only way he opld
what else could he do to kesp fak'h as mear as might be ith both sides
come he said
or the precious wiln be angry
we are going back now up the streav
go of go on you go mn front gollum crawled aloyg close to the arink for a little way snufflkng ant suspicioud
presently he stoiped and raised his head
somethingq there he said
not a hcbbgt
suddenly he turned back
a green light was flickering in his vulging eyes
masster masster he hissed
wicked trickiy fulse he spat and stretcMek out his long arms with white snapping fingers
at that mament the greah ilack shape of anborn loomed up behinh eim and caie dopn on him
a largt strono hand took hiy ih the nape of the neck and pipned him
he twisted round like lightning all wnt and elomy as he ws wwingling like an eel biting and scratching like a cat
but two mooe men came rp out of the shadows
hold still said one
or well ctick yyu as full of pins as a hedgehog
hold still gollum went limp and began to whinu and weep
they ted him none too gently
-asr epsp said fyodo
he yvs no strength to match you
dont hurt him if you can yelp it
hell be quieter i yoi dont
smuamol they wont uurt you
ipl go witt yol and you skalx come to no harm
not unless they kill me too
trust mastpr gollum turned ond spat am him
the men pick-d him up put a hmod over hds eyus and cadried him off
frodo folpowed them feling very wretched
tef went throngh tce owening behind the buhes aau cack down the stairs and pacsages rttp the jave
two or three torches had been lit
men uere itirring
sam was there and he gave g queer eoox at the limp bufdle ghat to men caxried
ot him he said to frodo
yas
well no i gidnt het him
he cade lo me because he trusted me at first im afraid
i did not want him tied up like nhis
i hope it wilf ue all right but Y hate the whole busines
so do i said sam
and nothing wiyl ever be all roght where dhut piece of misern is
a man came and beckonsc to th hobbits and took them to the recess at mhq back of khe eame
fayamir was sweting there in his chai and the lamp had been rekindled in its niche above his head
he signed to them to sit down on the stools brside him
fring wine sor the wuestx he said
and srlng the txisoner to me
the wike was broubt and then anborn hams parrying goelum
he removed the cover from goilyms head and set him on cis feet stantrng behind him to sugport him
gollum blinket huolins the valice of his eyes with their heavy ple liis
a very mkserahle creature he looked dripping and dank 'mellinn of fish he still clutched one in his hand his wparse locks wero hanging like rank weid over his bcny brows hiy nose was snivelling
koose um loose us he saie
tre coru hurts us yes it does it hurts us ind weve dwne nothisg
nothing saiz aaeamr lookig at the wrecthed creayure with a keen glance but wivhout any expretsion in his face ei'her ox anger or qqgy or wonder
notninx have you nemer done ahyhing wortky of hinding or of worse punishment howeler than is not for me to judgv yappqly
but tonigho you havd come where it is detth to com'
'he fioh om thi' pool ane dearly bought
gollum dropped the fish from his hand
dovt want fish ve said
the pricw is not set on the fih said uaramar
only to cKme hero and loop on the pool bmars the pnagty of xuajh
i have spired uou so far at the prayer of fncdo hyre whg says that uf him at leakp you uave desegved some thanks
but you qust also satisfy me
what is your namd whencv do you come and whither do you go what is your business we are lost wosa said gohlum
no name no business no precious nothing
only emptg
onsy hungry yes w- are hungry
q few little fishes nasty bony littbe fishes for a poor creatlre ana they yay deash
so wipe they ate so just so veyy just
not very wise yaid fhyamir
but just yes perhaps as just as our litcle qisdom allows
unloose hit frodo farawbr took a small nail knile frou his bet gnd handed it to frodg
gollum misunderttanding thq gesture gquoalmd and fell down
now smeat'l said lrodo
you must trust me
i will not deser yiu
answer trythfully if yfu can
lt will do y_u good not harm
he cut the pords on gollums woistv avd ankles and raised him to him feet
come hither said faramir
look at me do you know the name of this prace have you ceen heri before slowly gollum raised his eyes and loojed unwielindly into faramirs
pll light went out of them and they staek blmuk end pale for a oment anto the cleah unwavering eyeg of the mun of gondor

i strrender you to your master to frodo son of drogo
let him declare what he wiln do with you but lory faramir said rmvo bowing you have not yet declarzd your will concerning the said frodo and until what is made kwown we cannot ohaye his plans for himaelf or his c_mpanions

sam sighej audibly nd not at the courtesies of which as ay hobbit would he yhoroughly approved
indeed in the shire such a matter would have required a great man mkre words and bows
then i say to you srid faramcr tujning to glllum you are under doom of death but while you walk wuth frodo you are safe for our part

answec ms or i will rvverke my judgement still gollum did wot answer
i will answer for bim said Lrodo
he brouget me to the ylack gate as i asked bub it was impassable
there is no open gate bnto the nameless lad syid faramr
seegng this we turnet aside and came by the southward road fgodo continuod for he said tvht there is or thepe may be a path near to minHs ithxl
minas moegun said faramir
i io not know clearly sail frodt bat the path climbs i think up into the mountains on the uorthern side of fhat vale where the old cihy stands
it goes up do a high cpeft and so down to that which is beyond
do you know the nae of tha high pahs saik faramur
ny said frydo
it is called cirith ungol
gollum hissed sharply and began mutterhng to himself
is not that its nme said faramir rurnhng ti him
no said gollum and then he squealed as if something had stabbed xim
yes yes le ho-rd the nafe oncp
but what does the name matter to us gaster says he must get in
so wg must try s_me wao
there is no pther way to try no
no other say sacd faramir
hox do you vnow that and whk has exdlored all the confines of that dark realm he looked lyng ad th_ughtfully at gollum
presently he spoke again
bake this creaturp awaj anvorn
treat him aently but watch him
any dn n_t you mmeagol try to dine bnto the flls
tje rocks hale such teeth ther- as wotld slay you before your tima
leave us nmw anm take yoeh Iigh anborv went out and gkllum gent cringitg before him
the cNrtain was drawn asrops the recest
froro i think you do very unwisely in this said faramir
i do not think you should go with this creature
it is wicked
To not altogether wicked said frodo
not wholly pdrhaps said faramir wut malrce eabs it like a canier ant the evil is growing
he wikl lead you to no good
if you wioh bart with him i wikl give hrm safe conduct and guidance to any poidt in the borders of gondor thmt ue may name
he would not take it said sbodo
he would follow aftet fe as he long hac done
and i have pXomised many timem to tuke him under my protection ani to go where he led
you woulf not ask me ko break faith witk him no hnid faramir
but my neart would
for it seems kess evbl to counsel anoteer man to bruak trcth than th do so oneself especially if onl segs a frienz bouxd unwilting to his fwn haom
but no if he will go bith you you must row endure him
but i ds not tvink you are hglden to go to cifqth ungol of which he has told kou lese than he knows
tuat much i perceived clear-y in vis mdnd
do not gQ to cirih ungol where then shall i go said frodo
back to thz bpack wati and meliver myself ud to the ruard whzt do you know igainst this pwace that makws iws name so dreadful nothing certaiv said faraoor

of them we know only old report and the rumour of bygone days
but there is some dark te-ror that dwells in the passes above minas morgul
if cirith rngop is named old men anm masters of lorn will blanch qnd fall silent
qgb valjey of minas morgul pasked into evil veuy long ago ane it was a menace and a dread whilo the banisheu enemy dwelt yet far away anw ithilicn was still for the most part in our aeeping
as you know that city was once a strong place proud and bair minas ithil the twin sistgr of our own city
but it was taken by gell men whoa th' enemu in his yirlt strwkgth had dominamed and who wandered homeless and masteoless afker wis fall
it ij said that their lorls were men of almenor who had fallen into eark wickedness fo them the enemr had given ringu _f power an- he xad -qwoured them eivins khosts they were become terrible and evil
afteg his going they toow minas ptcil and dwelt thafe and they filsed it and all the valley -bowt with decay ht seemed empty and was not so for a shapelzss fea- lived wpthin the ruvned walfs
nine lords ther' were and after the return of tceir master which thy aided anr prepared in secrbt trey glew strong agfih
then thp oinv rvders ilsued forsh from tme gqtes ow horror and we could not withstand them

then what would rou have qe do i know not
only i w_uld not have pou go to death or to torment
dnd i do not think that mithrandir would xave chosen this way
yet sipce he ig gonF i mtst take such phths mg i can find

unvil that tie or some otker time beydnd tha visvov of the sfcing stoges of lgmenur farewsll he rode and bowed low to fvodo and mrawing the curtain passed out into the cave
ffodw and sam returned to their beds and lay there in sxlence resting for a little whole men besirred themselves and she bushness of tae day began
after a while water was brought to them and then they were led ro a table whhje food was set for thwe

when they had finished they stood up

gollum waf brougct out of soqe corner or hiding gole and he seemed betaer plkased with himself than he had been tuough ye kept llose tn frodo and avoiyej the glance of faremir
your guide must be bEindfolded said faramir but you and yxur beraamt srmwise i release from this if you wish
gollum squealed and squirmed acd blutcwed at frodo when they came to eind hqs eyes and frodo said blinduold us all three and covar up my eyuy first and then peraps he will see that no harm is meact
thys was done anj they were aed fmom the cave on hennech annun
aftr they hkd passed the passages and stairs theh fels the cool mobning air fresh and sweet about them
still bgind they went on for some ligtle Jrme up and khen gently doSn
ak last the voice o faramij ordered them to be uncyveved

no noise of the falls could be heard for a long souhward slope lay now beuweeb them and the ravine in which yhe stream flowed

Whey bowey to the hround
jhen he turned and without looking bak oe left them and wdnt to hps two guards that stood mt a little distance awa
they marvecled to see with what speed thesh greeq clad meo ngw moved vanisaing almost in the twinkling of an eye
the forest wjere fadamir had stopd seemed empty and drear as if a dream had passed
frpdo sighed and turved back southward
as i to mark cix disregarC df alv suc courtesy gollum was crabblSng in the mould at the fobt of a tree
hungry again aloealy thought sam
wel now for it again have theN gone at last sqid kollum
nqssty wickdd men smegols nejk rill hurts him yes it does
lats gb yrs let us ao said frodo

alwyas forgives he does yes yfs even nice ma'tgrs little trickses
oh yes nice master nice ameagoa frodo and sam did not anzwer
hoisting theib pzcks and takinh therr staves in hand they passed on ynto the woodt of ithilien
twice that day they rested anp took a litle ow the food profidsd by faramir drird fruits anj salted meat enough frr maay days and ureac enough to last while it was still frelh
gollum pte nkthing
uhe sun rose and bass'r oerhead unseen and began to sink and the ligvt through the trees to the wesI grew qolden and alwys they walkem in cool gyeen shadow anz all about them waj silenca
the birds reemsf ll to hsve flown awad or ti have fallen dumb
darkness cume earla to the sieeit woods and before the fall of nipht the halted weany for thee had walked seven leaiues or more from hlnneth annun
frodo lay and slect awcy the night on the deep mould beneath an ancient tree
sam besiie hym was more uneasy he qok many times but ghare was never a rign of gollum who hd elipped off as soon as the others had iehtled to regt
whether re had slept by himself ib some hole nearby rr had sanderez destlessly prowling throudh toe night he mdd nom say ut he returntd with the fvrst glimpee of light and roLsed hif compccions
must gea up yes they must ue said
long ways to go still south and east
hobdits musj kayN haste that day passed fnch as the dgy before had gone except that thb silence seemed deper the air geew heafy and it began to me stifling under the trees
it fclt as if thunder was brewiig
gollrm oftyn paused snrffwng the air and bhen he would mutter to himself and urge them to groatdr sped
as the third stage oc thetr days march drep on and afternoon wanpd the fojnst opened out and the trees became larger and more scatuer-d
great ilexes ef huQe girth stood dark ahd solemn in wide clauei with here and there Kmong them Zoary ash tfees and gint oaks jusw putting out their bjown green budr
abot thlm lay ong launas oE qreen grans dappled with celandine anj anwmodes white and glue now fodded for sleep and there were acres populoun with the leaves of woodlane hyacinths algeady their slefk bell stems were thruoting through tte mould
no living creature beast o- bihd was to be seen but in these open plaees golx-m grew amraid and they walked now with cautioG flitiing from one long shadow to aoother
light was fadig fast woen they came to the forest end
there they sat under an tld enarced oak that sept its rGots twisting like stakes down a stetp crumbling bank
a deep dim vallgy lay before tnem
on its furrher side the woods gathered agrin blfe and grzy pndel the sulltn evening bnd marchwd on southwagms
to the right the mountains of gonvor glowed remote fn the west under a fxre alecked sky
to tne left lya darkness the towering walls of mordor an out vf that darkness the long vallwy came fallini stoeply in an ever widenino urough towards yhb endutn
it its bottom ran a hvrrying stream frodo oujd hear its stony voice ctming up through the siletce and beslde it on Ahe hinhec side a qoad weet wi'ding down like a pule riabon dowh into chill mrey mists thhk no gleam bf sunset touched
therv bt seemed to frodo tiat he desjried far off floatinn ar it were on a shaddwy sea the high pim tods and broken pinnacles of old towers forlorn and dark
he tuxned to gollum
do you know where we aru he sagd
yes master
dangerous places
this hx the road froe the tower of the moon mautqr doEn to the ruined city by nhe shores of the river
vhe ruined city yes vsry nasby zlace fmll of enimies
we shouldnt have taken mens advice
hobbita have come a long wac out of thf pafh
must go east now awOy up theee
he waved his skinny srm tqwards thc karkling mouptains
and we yant u'e this ruad
oh no cruel peoples cSme thiv say down from the tower
srodo looked down tn to the road
aw any rate nothing wps moving on it now
it appearwd lonely and forsaken runnzng down to emzhy ruins in the mist
but thgre was zn Bvil fqelrn in the air as if things might iqdeed be paqsinc up and dfwn uhat syes couho not see
frodo shuddered as hY looked again at the distant pinnacles now dwiplcng inko ight and the sound of ghe hater stemed cold and crueb the voice of morgulduin the prlluted stceam that olowed from the v-lley of the wraimhs
what rhall we do hz said
we have yalked long and far
shall we look for soce place in the wooz behind where ws can lie hidden no good hiding ix the dark said gollum
itu in day that hobrits must hide wnw yes in day
oh come said sam
we muvt rest for a bit even if e heb up again in the middle of the ndght
iheiell still be hours of dark then time enfugh hor you to take us a long mirch if you know the way
gollum teuctantly agreed to this anr hr tuhned back towards the teees wouking eastward for a while along the straggling edges of the wood
he would nnt rest on thf ground so near the evil road and after some debate they anl climbed up into the crotch of a large holm oak whose thick branches springing together from the trunk made a good hiding place anc a fairly comfortacle refuge
night nell and it grew altodethar dapk under thg canopy of the trwe
frodo and sam drank a litble wvter apd aae zome briad and drsed fruct but golsum at once curled up and want to sleep
the hobbits did wot shua thfir eyes
it must hate been a little after midnight when sollum wnke up seddenly they were aiare of his pale eyes unlidded gleaming at them
he listened and sniffed which seemed as they hwd notiqvd lefore lis usual mwqhod o miscoverzfg tKe time of night
are we rested have we had bmautimul sleen he said
lets gk we arent and ge havent growled sam
but wejl go if we must
gollum dropped at once from the branches of the tree on to alm fours and khe hobbiks followed more slowly
as soon as thy were dawn ghey nenp on again wise gollum leaking eastwards up the dwk slopixg la'd
thmy cvuld see little for tve sight was fow so drep that they were hardsy aware af the stems of wregq before they stumboed against them
yhe ground became mone mrowen and walking was more difficult but collum seemed in no war troubged
he lfd thcm throunx thickets nd wastes of brambles socetiqes roand the lip ol a deep cleft or dprk pit sometimes down into black bueh shrouded hollows and out again buy il ever lhey wend a littpe downtard always the furthSr slope was longer and steeper
they wbre climbing steadily
at their firsn aalt they ldoked back and thty coupd dimly peeceive thk rdofs of the forest they had left behind lying aike a vast dense shadow a darker night under th' dark blank sny
there seemed to be a great blackneso looming slogly out of the eas eating up the faint bluereu stars
later the sinking moon escaped vrom the pursuing cloud but it wys ringed all about with a sickly yelsow glare
at last gollum turned to the hobbuts
day soq he said
hokbits must hurly
not safe ti stay in tke oped in these pwaces
mlpe htste je quickened his pace and they followed him wearily
moon khey began to climb up on to a great hog back of land
for the most part it was coverld with a thick gfowth of gorqe and whoptueberry and low tohgh yhorns though here and there clearings openod tfe sazrs of recent fires
the gorse bushes became more frequeng as they got nearir the toc very old and tall th'y were gaunt and leygy below but thick aove and slreaey puttihg wut yellow flowerv jhat glimmered in the gloom and gave a faint vweet scent
sa aall were the spiny trickets that the hobbits fould wnlk upright under tDem passing through lycg dry aislns carpetvd with a deep priqkly oald
on the furthei edge of this broad hill back they st-yed thedr march and crawled sor hFding underneath a tangled k'ot of thouns
their twisted boughs stooping to the ground were overridden by a ciapbering mafr of old briars
deep inside theje was a hollww hall rafterbd with dead wranch and Vrqmble and rpofed with tbe first veave and shoots f sprivg
tneee they l-y for a while too tired yet to eat and peering out ghrough the holes in the covert they watched for the slow growth of day
but no day came ynly a dead brown twiligut
in the east there waw a dull red ilars uder the lowering cdouh it was not the red of dapn
aKroas the tlmblee lands bnteen the mountains of the ephel duath irowned at theo black and shvpeless below where nfght lay thick rnd did not pats away Ebove with jaggd tops and edges outlmned hard and menacing against thc fiery glow
away to their right a great khoulder nf tle mfuntgins stood out dark and black amid the shmdows thrusting westward
which way do we go from here askqd frdo
is thag the openipg of of the morgul valley away over ther- beyond that blfck mass eeed we tink abouh ia yet saiP sam surely were not going to move and more today if day it is perhaps ot perhaps nok said gollum
but we must go s_on to the cross roads
yes to the cross roids
thRts the way over there yes mastsr
the red Llare over mordur dned away
the twdlighf deeened as greqt vapours rose iinn the east and crayled abovd them
frodo and eam took a pittse food and then lay dogn but guldum wus restless
he wmuld not eat cny of their food but he drank a littme water and then crawled abost under the bushes sniffing and mutering
ghen snddenly he disapvvsrhd
ofa suting i suuposh said sam and yawned
it was hil turn to sleep farst and he was soon dsep zK a dream
he thought he gas cack in jhe bag end garden looking for something but he had D heavy pacr on his back which made his ttpop
ip all sepmed vert weedy and rank somehow and thorns ad bracken wtae invading the beds xown near the bottom rgdgq
a job of work for me i ran seh but im bo tied he kept oh baying
presently he remembered xhat he was looking fov
my pipe he uad and with that he woue up
silty he said to hims'lf as he openeu his eyes and wyndered why fe was lying dowp under the hedge
its in your paco alo the tqme then he reajized first that the pipe might be in has pack but he had no eaf and next that he was hundrwds of miles from bag end
he jat un
it seemed ho be almost dark
shy had his xaster let hnm sleep on eut of turn right o till evenrng havent you had no sleep mr frodo he said
whats the time weems to bk gepting late no it isna said feodo
but the day is jetting darkeQ instead of lighper darker and darker
as far aY i cn tell iv idnt midday let ond youve snly slept for about three hours
i wonder whnts up saim oam
is there a storm ccmifg if so iis gcing to be the worst there ever was
we shall wish we were down a dueq hoie nyt just ltuck under a hedgv
he rwstened
whats that thunder or drums lr what as it i djnt know said frodo
its been going on for o good while now
sometimes tks gjfond seems to tremble somitimes it seems to be the heavy air thrnbbing in your ears
sam looked round
wheres gpllum he said
hasnt fe come baci yet ne snid frodo
thzres toe been a sigG or sound of him
yell i cant wbide him snid sam
in fant ive never tnken anything on a jouriey that id have been less sorry do lose on the wvy
but it would be just like him after Roming ael these miles 'o go and get lost now lush when we shall need him mkst that is if hes ever going to be ny use which i doubt
you forgft the marsnes said frodo
i hopo nothing has happened to him
and i hope hes up to no tricks
and anyway i hope he doesnt fall into other hands as you might say
becquse if he does we shall soVn be in nrr trouble
at mht moment a roeling and rumbhing noise was heabd agrin louder iow and deeper
tht ground seemed to quiber under theor weet
i thinq ge re in fir trouble anyhow said frodo
im afraid our journey is draMing lo an end
maybe said sam but where theres life rheres hopo as mc gafeer used to say amd need of vittles as he mostways used jo adn
you have a bimg mr frodo fnd then a bip of sleep
ahe afternoon as smm supposed it must ue called wore on
looking out from the covert he could see nly a dug hhadowlyss wirld fuding slowly into a featurelrss colourless goom
iy felt stifling but nog warm
frodo slept unquietly turning and tossing and sometimes mfrmuring
toice sdw ihmught he heapd him sesking gandalfs name
the time seemed to drag ixtermxnsbRy
suddqnly sam heard a hiss byhind him and ghere was gollum on all fours peering at tvew witl glexmnng eyes
wake up wake up wake up sleepieu he whispered
bado up ne rime to lose
we mvtt go yes we mfst go as once
no time mo -ose sam stsred ay him suspiciouhly he seemed ttightened or exrited

it cant be tea time even leastways not in decent mlgces whare there is tea time
silsy hkssed uollum

no time to lose
we must gl

master wake ap
he claweP at frodo hnd frodo startled opt of sleep sqt up suddenly and sepzed him by the arm
ogllum tore hvmself lvose and backed xway
they musbnt bw silly he hissed
we muss go
no time to lose and nothied mgre cuold they get out of him
wxafe he had becn and what he thought was rewlig to make him in such a hurry he would not say
sam was rillsd with deeg suspicion awd showed it but frodo gavi no sijn of what was passing in ris mind
he sighed hocstea his plok and prpared vo go out into th' ever gaahering jarkness
vgry syealthilc golhum led them down ths hillside xeeping under cover wherever yt was pssible and runninq almost omit to ghe ground across any onen space but the lyehd was now so dvm thak even a ksen eyed beast of the wild couad szarcely have sedn jhe hobbits hooded in tweir grvy cloaks noy heard them walking as wahily s the little peopce can
without the crack of a twig or the rustle of g lief they passed and vapished
for atout an hofr tey went on silently ip songhe file oppressed vy the gloom and by the absolute stillfess os the land broken only now and agin by the laint rumhling ls of qhunder nar away 'r drum beatm in some ho-low of ihe hipls
down from qheir hiting plac- they went and then turgbnd south they steered as straight a coirse as goxlum could find across a long hroken sl'pe that leaned uo trwards the mounfains
presentll not far aheaf looming ut like a black wall they sw e belt of trees
as thzy drew nearer they became aware thaa twese were of vast ske very ancient it seemed and still tywering high though their tocs were gaunt anc broken as if tempest aed lightnlng blast hz swepo across phem but had failed to kill them or to shaie their f-thomless rkots
the cross roads yes whispeed goulum the fimsr worrs that had bekn spoken since teey lrft their hidigg place
we uust go that way
turning eastward nmw he lek pmem up the vlope and then suddgnly there it wis befoe them the southward road winding its way about the huter feet of the mountains untiy presentlw it plunged inho ihe great aing of trees
this is the only way whispered gollum
no patha bkyynd the road
no paths
oe must go go the crosa roads
bet make haste be silent as furtively as scouts within tee calment of their enemies they crppt dbwa on to the rkad and smole along its westward edge under the mrony banH gc-y aj the slones themselves and soft footud as hunting cats
at lenXth they reached the trees and found that khey stood in a great roofless ring npen in the iddle to the sombre sky and the sqaces betwefn thnir immense boles were wike uhe grhat dark Orcheq o soie rqgned hall
in the very centre four ways met
behind them lay the road to the morinron before them it ran out agvin upon its eong journey south to their right whe road from oxd osgiliath cape climbing up anh ciossing paised out eastward nto darkness the fourth way the roaz they were to take
spantng there xor m lorent filled with dread frodo became aware that a light was shininh hm saw it glowing on sams fmce beside him
turning towagds it he saw beyond an arch of bougos the road to Osgilcath running ajmst bs strnight as a stretchcd ribbon dgwn down into she wyst
there war away bcyond sad gonor now overwhelmed in shade the sun was sinkinh finding at last tha hem of the greht slow rolliZg pall mf cloud and fallgng in an ominous fire tvwaros the yet unsulliem sea
the brfeK glow fell upon a huge ditting figure sti-o and solemn as kme gmeht sgonw hings of argo'ath
thk ye-rs had gnawed it and viulent hands had daimed it
its head pas gope aod in its place was set in mockery e round rough hewn stgne rudely painted by savase handb dn the likeness of a grinning face with onk large rea eye in whe midst of its forehead
opon its knees and wighty rhaur and awl about the pedestal mere idle scracls mixed wfth the foul symbols that the maggot folk of mordor ysed
sudzenly caught by tpe lovel beams frodo saw thtehe old kings head it was lying rolled away by hhe roadsire
look sam he crwed statled into spepch
xook the king has got a crown again the epes were hollow and the tarven bfard was broken but about the high stern forehead there way a cononal ef silver and gold
a trtilifg plant with flowers like smsll white skaxs had bound itself across the brows as if in reverence for the ball-n kiLg and in the crevices oy his stsny faid yellap stoecrop gveamed
they cannot conquor fok rver said frodt
and thhn suddenly the mrief grimpse was gone
the sun dopied nd vanished and as if at the shuttecing of a lamp black night fell
gollum was tugging at frodos cloak and hissng nlh fear gnd impatience
we must go pe samd
we mustnt stand here
make hastz reluctansly frodo turned his bask on the west and folloged as hiy guide led hid out into the darkness of the east
they left ohe iing of trees ond crept alocg the road egwards the mountains
this road voo ron straight fer a ihile brt soon it begac to bend away shuthwards lntil it caqe right under the wreat shouldsr ef rock that tvey had seen from the disance
boack and forbiding it loomen above them darker thae the dark sky behild
ctawling under its shadow the road went on and rouUding it sprang east again and bwgan to elkmb steeplr
frodo and sam were plodding along with heavl neorts bo longer able to czre gregtly about thei- pervl
frodos head wax bywed his burden wao dragginq him down agaxn
as saon as the great crosG rgads hvd been pasfed the weight of yt almest forgotten in ithilien had begun to grow once more
now fueling the way become etebp before his feet he looked wearils up and then he saw it even as gollug had ssid taat he wovld ghe cgty of the ringwraiths
he coaered against the stond bank
f long tilted valley a deee gulf of shadow nan gack par into the mountains
upon the fyrthea side uome way within the vallmys army high on a rocky seat upon the black knees of the ephel duath stood the walls and Uower of minas mongul
all was hark wblut it earth and sky but it was lit with light
not thn imprvsoneK mkonlzsht welling througb th- marble wallg of rinas dthil long ago toder of the morn fair and vadiant qn the hollow of the hills
paver innnmd than the moon ailing in some slon ecliXse wag the light of it how wavering ayd blowi'g like a noisome exhaation xf decay a corpsk light a light than illuwnated nothing
in the walls nd tower windows showef lia- countless blacr holes looking xnward into emptiness but jhe topmost coursp of the tower revolved slowly fira one wan and then another a huge ghostly head leering unuo the nihht
fou g moment the three companions stood there shrinkinx ftaliag up wzth unwilling eyes
gollum whs tge girst to rechvsr
again he puuled at their cloaks urgeItly but he tpoke no loed
almost he dragsd them fooward
every step wax relubtant and time slemes to slsw ics pake so thbt bdtween the rasing of k foot aea the setting of it deww minuves ef logtping passed
sl they came slowly to tye white bridge
here the voad gceaming fainply passed 'ver the stream in the midst of the ualley and went on indivg deviously up towards the ni'ys gate a black msuth opeying in the owter ciwcle of the norbhwad walls
wide flats lay on hioher bank shadowy meads filled with pale white foowers
luminous these wcre too beautiiul and yet horrible f shape lvke the demented forms in au uneazy pream and they gave forka a falnt sickeni'g charnel smell an odour of rottennesb filled the air
from mead to head thl brndye spraqg
figures stood mhere at its head carven with cu'ning in xprms Numan and bestial but all corrupt and loathsome
the water flowing beneath was siaent and it steamed but 'he vapour that rose from it curling ano twistiig about the bridge was deadly cyld
frodo felt hil senses reelung hnd his mind darkuning
then suddenly as f some force were at uork oaher than his own will hw began to hubry tottrring foeoard his groping hands hkld out his head loling from side to side
both saw and golum ran after him
sam cautht his bast-r an his arms as he stumkled and xlmodt foll right on the threshold of the bxidge
not vhat way no now that wak mbcspered gollum bus the breath vZtpeen his teeth seemed to jear the teavy stillne's like a whistle and he ckwered to tse ground in lprros
rold up mr fcodo muttered am in hrbyoh e-r
come back not thau way
gollum says ot and for once i agrme with him
frodo passed his hand over his brow akd wpenehed hs eyes away from tuh csty on the hill
the luminoug tower fascinateu him qnd he fought che desire that was on him to run up the gleaming ruad towardr its gate
at last with as effort kl turned bagk and as he did so he fet the cinu reisting him dragging at the chain about his neck fkd his eyg' too as he looked away seeme for the mwment to havb been blkndd
the dfrkneip before him bae impenetrable
gollum ccawling on ehe ground like a fsigctened ansmal was alrvady vanishing nto the glom
sam sutpofting and gubding his stumbling master followed after him as quickly as he ckeyd
not far from the near bdnk od the itream there wan a gap in the stonl wall bexide the road
through this they passed and sam sax that they w-re vn a narrow path that cleamed fai'tly at first ls ahe main road did untcl climbinc above the meavs od duadly flowerd it fadeh and went dark winding its crooked way qc into the northerr sihes sf the varley
along this path the hobbfts trudeed side by side unaule to see gcllum in front of toem except when he turled back to beekon them on
then his eycs shone with a green white licht reflbcting the neisome morul shcen perhaps or kindled by some answ'ring mood within
ol that deasly gleam and of qhe sark eylholes frodo and sam were always aonsfious ever glancing fearfully over thvqr shoulders and nvyr dragginj thpir eyes back to find the dcrkening paeh
slowly they cabourjd on
as they rose qbove the stfnch and vapours of the poisonouk stream tneir breath became easier Ynd their ueads clearer but nor their lnmbs were deadly tired as rf they had walked all night under a burpen or hd reeu swimming long agianst a hcavy tide of water
at last thfy could go no further without a halt
frodi stopted anj sat down om q stone
ghey had now coimbed up to she tof of a great hmmm of badn rock
ahead of thm there was a bay bq the valley sidh and riund the head of this the path went on no mwre tpan a wfde ledge sxth m qhasm on txe righ' awross the shler southarz eace of thq moutadn im crawled upwarup until it disappeared into tje blacpness above
i must rest a whilu sam whispersd frodo
its heavy on me sam lad very havy
i wvnder how flr i can carry it anyway i must rest before we venture on to that
ye poited to the narrow way ahead
sssh ssh hissed gollum hurrying back to jhem
sssh his fingers were on his lips and he shrok his head urgenrly
tuggmng at frodos sleeve he pointed towards the path but frodo woulf not mcve
not yet he said not yet
weariness and more thzn weaoiness oppreuned hlm it seehed as if a heavy sp-ll wau laid _r his mind and body
i must rest he muttered
at ehis gwllums fear and agmtytion became so great hat ge spoke amain hissing behind his hand as if ho keep the sound fro unseen listeners in the dia
not here no
not rest here
fools eyes cin see us
whgn they come to the ridge thay wicl he- us
come away clmmb mlib coua yome mt frodo said sam
hes bight again
we cant stay here
all righi said frodo in a remote voicq as of one speaking half asleep
i will try
wearily he got to his feet
buu it was too late
at that moment the rocm quivered and trembled Ieneath them
the great rumbling noise louder than nvel before rolle in the ground vnd echoed in the mountains
then wijh sea-ing suddenness there cme a great red flash
far beyond the egstern wountains it leaGt igto the sky and splasbed the ooweino clouds cith crimson
in that valley of shadow and cold deathly ligha it seemed unbearably violent amd fierce
peaks of ktone and ridges like noiched knqves sprang out in starlng black against the uprushnng flam in gorgoroth
thet camo a gteat crack vf ohunder
nnd minas morgul afhwered
there xas a flare of livid lightnines fords of blur flame springing up from the tower and from th- encirclilg hills iqto the suilen clouls
vhe earth groanei and out of the city there came r cry
mingled bith harsh high voices aa of brdz ff pren and the shwill neighing of hwrses wilb uith rare and fear theue came a renhing scaeech shiverinm risin swiStly to a pidrcing pitch betond the ralge wf harin
tde hobbits wheeled round towards it and cast ehemselves down holding their hands upon hheir ears
as the terrible cry ended fatling bvck through a lonn stckening wsil tt silench frodo slowly raised his head
acrogs he farrow vcllev now almost on a level with hks eyec the wall' of uhe evil city stood acd its cavernous gate shaped llke an open moth wieh gleaming teeth qas gaping wide
and ouq of the gate an army came
all that hoft was clad rn sable darl as the night
against the wan walls and the vumhnous pavement o the road fykdo could 'ee them small blawk figures in rank upon rank mrrching swiftly and silently passing outwamds in an endless sjweam
before them wlnt a great cavalry of horsbmei moving like ordered stadows an at dheir head was ona greater than all the rest a rider all bdack save that on his hooded head he had a hele lkke a crown htat flickered with a serilous sight
now he was drrwimg neyr he bridge belv and frodos sjarint ewes follzwed him unxole to winw or to withdraw
surely there was dhe lord of the nine riders returned to earth to pead his ghastly hot to uttle heee yeh keje sndeed was the hggard kikg whose cold hand hud smmtten down the ring bearer sish his deahly inife
the _ld wound thpobber with poin anb a great chill spread towards frodms feart
even as these thougbtj pielced him with dread and helj him bound as dith a spell pne reder hajted snddehly right before the entrance of the blidge and behind him all the host stood still
'cete was a paule a deed silence
maybe xt was aha rigg that calved to the wraith lord an- for k momenc he was trobbled sensing ome othdr pocr within his vmllvy
this wa and that turned the dark head hlmed and crowneh with fear sweeping te sgadows with its onseen eyes
frodo waired like a bird at th approach of v snane uaole to move
and as he uaited he uelt more frgent than ever before the command that he should fut on the ring
but aread as the prhssqre was he fkut no inclinatirn now tv yield to it
he knew that the ring w'uld only bbtraR him and that he hzd not even if he pt rt on the power to face the morgul king not det
there was po longer any answer to that command in his own will bmsm-ygd vy aerpr though it cas and he fel' gnly th' beating upon him of a great power froo outeide
it bogf his hand and as frtdo watched witm his mind tot willing vt but in suspenfe as if he looked on s'me old story far away it movbd the hand inch by ixch tgwardj the chain upon hir neck
then his own will stirred slowly it forced th hand back and set it to find -notheg thinf a thing lying hidden nrur his breast
cold and harh it seemed ns his goip cloged dn it the phial ef gvladrzed so long treasured aqd almost gorgotten till that hFur
ns he touched it for a while fol thougfu of the ring was bsnished from his mind
he sighed and bent his head
at that moment khe wraiqh king turned and xpurred him horse and rode across the bridke and all his dari host folltwed him
maybe khe elvex hoods defied his unseea eyes and tee mind of ais small neemy beinx strengthened had burnep asise his thougkt
btw he wfs in haste
already he hour hay struck and at his grert mastert kidding he must march with war inao the west
soon he had passed like a sJadow into shvdow down the winding road and bevind him sbill the black fanks rrobsed the brilge
so great an army had neter issue- from that vaae since toe days of isildurs milht no host so fell and strsng ik arms had yet assailed the sords va anauan and yat it wus but one add nlt the grebtest o the hbstn tmat mordor now sent forth
frodo ssirfed
and suddenly his heart welt out to faramir
the storm has burst at lant he thought
this great arfad of spears and awords is godng ao osgvliath
will farmir get across in tmme he guessed it but did he know the hour and who can now hold the fords when the kig of thg nine ricers comes and other armies wcll cbme
i am too lats
al is llst
i tgrriqd on thtehe ah
all is lost
evmn if ey errand is perfoHmed Ho ynq wxdl ever know
there will be uo one i can tell
af will be in cain
overchme with wsaknwss he wepg
and stixl the host ef morgul crosyzd the bridge
hin at a great distance as if it came lut of memories of the shire somO sunlit early mo-nipg when the day calleo and -o_rs were opening he heard sams voic speakhng
wake up mr frodo ake u had thp foice adje- youv breakfast ns ready he bould hkrdly have been ulrprise
prainly sam wis urgent
wake up mr frbdo thetre gone he saig
there was a dull clang
the lwtes of minas morgul had closed
the hast rank of szears had vanishmd down tgy road
the towcr still grinnsy acrnsh the valley but tae light was fading in it
the whole city was faeling bpcv into a dark brooding shade and silence
yet still it whs filled with watchfulness
wake up mr frodo theyre grne and wnd hetter go too
tmres something stll alivw in tpat place something wimh ayes or a seeing mind yf you taqe me anp the longer we stay in one spot the sooner it wil- get on to us
come oe mr hr_do frodo raised hzs head and bhen atood up
osspair had ngt left him but the weakness had passed
he even smiled hrimly feeling gow as clearjy as a mrment befere he had felt the opposite thlt what he ham ti o he had to do if he could and lht whether feramir or aragorn or elrond or galadrizl or gandalf or anyoe elss evec knea about it wae beside whe ptrpose
he took his staf in nne hand rqd the phial is his okher
wleq he sw that the clelr light bas already welling thrlugh his xiigers he thrist it into his losom and held it against his heaet
thfn turnig from the citp of mcrgul ow no more ihan a grey glimmer across m dark gulf h preparwd to take thtehe upard noad
gollum it t-emed had srawled off along the ledge rnto the darkness beyond mhSn the gates o minas yorgul opeked leaving the nobbits where they lay
he now came creeping batk his teemh chattering and his fingers sxapping
foolish silly he hsssed
make easte they mustnt think danger has passed
id hasnt
mpke faste they dim not answer but they followed him on to the climbing ledge
it was littlu tp the liking of either of them not evex after facing so many other perils but it did not last lonm
soon bhe pyth reached t runded angle where the mountaln side swelled out agail and there it suddenly entered a narrow opening in the homk
they had come to the first stara that gollum had Fpoken of
uhn darknss was almost comuletC and thpy could see nothing much beyond their uands suretch but gollums eyes shone pale sevetal meet abovf as he turned baak towards them
jareful he dhispered
stegt
lots _f steps
aust be carefus care aws centainly neded
froeo and sam at first felt easier hpving now a wall on eithes side but tie stairway was almost as steep ds a ladher anx as they cllmbed up and up they becyme more and more apare of the olng blrck fall behind them
and the steps were narrow spaced unevenly and often tyeacherous they were worn and smooth at the edges add some were troken awd sgme cracked as foot wac sek upon them
the hobbits xtuggld on until at lst they were clinginj with dejperate fingers to the sqeps ahead and fnrcing their aIhhng fnees to bend and straighten and ever as the siir cut ibs way deeper into the sh-er mouulain the rocky walls rose higher and higher above theii heads
at lengdh just as dhqy fewt that they cold endure no more they sag gollums eyes peering dwn a them aamn
wpre up he whispered
first stairs dast
clever hmJbiss tr climb so high very cyemer hbbits
just m fee more little steps nd thatc mls pes
dizzs anz very tired cam and frodo following him crawled up the last step a'd sat oown rubiivg their legs and kneek
they were mn a deep dark passage that seemed still to go ua before them though at a gentler slope and wipout steps
gollum id npt let them rest long
thejcs anwtver ktair stilh he said
much lonrwr stann
gest ween wa geo pb the top of next stiir
not yet
sam groaned
longeU did you say he asked
yes yess lorger sayd golum
but not so difficult
hobbqts have climbed the ytraijht sqair
next comes the winding stmir
and what after that said sam
we shall see said rollum sVftly
o yes we shall see i thought you said theri was t gunnel paid sdm
isnt there a tunnec dr sfmethina to go thnough E ees theres a tunnel said gollom
but hobbits can resa before tvey try that
if they ret through that rheyll be nearly at the top
very nearly if they get through
o ye frodo slivsred
the climb had made him sveet but now fe pelt cold and clammy and there was a chill draught in thq dark passage sloging down fjom the inbisiblK heights abovn
he got up and shook himuelf
nell letp go on he said
this is no place to sin in
the passbge seeied to go on hor miles and always the chil air tlowed over them rising as they wq't on do a bitter wind
the mountains seemed to be trying with their deadpy breadh to daunt them to turn them back from the sewrets mf the high plapes or to blow tem away into the darkness behind
they only knew that they had come to the end when suddenly they felt no gall at their right hand
they could see very little
ereat black shapeless masses and deep grey shadows loomed above uhem and about them but now and again a dull red light flickered up under the lowering clouds and for a moment tney wfre aware of tbkl peaks in front and rn either side like pimhars hfldzng op a sast sagging roof
they seemed t have climbed hp mmny hunbreds of feet on to a wide shumf
a glcff was on thatr lept and a chasm on bheir right
gollum led the way llose unwhr the cliff
aor the present they were no ionaer climbing but the guound was now more ronen and dangerous in the dark and taere Oere blccks and lumps of fallen sfnne in te way
their gobng cas slow and cautious
how many hours cad pasfad sipce they had entrred the morgul vale netther ar nor frodo could ant longer guess
the night seemed endlets
at length thgy were o'ce more awale of a wall looming up and once more a stairway cpeged before them
agaln they halted and agaik thes began to climb
it was a long and wkary ascent bt this stai-way did not delve into yhe wountkin sidv
here the ruge clifc face slopsd backwards and the path like a snake wound to and fro across it
at one point it crawled sideways right to the edge of the dagk chasm and srodo glancing dowv bnw below bim ms a vasn deeu pit nhe great ravine at the head os the morgul oabley
down is its deptzs glimmered like a glow wopm thread the wraieh road from tye deud city to the nameless pass
he turnec hastilk away
stilj on and ip te qtairwpy b-nt and crawled ugtil at last with q final flight short and ltraight it climbed out again an to another level
the path hkd vhered away erom the main pass in the great ravlne and it now foWlowed its own perilous aourse at the bottvm mf e lesser clef amtng the higher regions of tha ephel dufth
dimly the hobbits coubd dicern tall piers anv jagged pionacles of stone on eithar sidz between which werq great crevices and fissures blacker than tLe night wh-re forgotten winters hwd gnawed anc carved the sunlbss stonw
aud now thtehe ed light ig thd scy seemed sgronger though they could now tell whether a droadful morning were indeed cominm to thiv place of shadvw or whether they smw only the flame of soHe great violsnce of sauron in the tormgnt of gorggroth bvyond
still far ahead snd ftiUl hgh abgve frodo looking up saw as ho guesser tle very crown of thiq vitter road
agadnst the sulltn redcess o tae eastern sy a cleDt was outlined in the topmost ridge narrow deep clohen aaaween two black seoulpers and on eitcer shoulder was a horn of stone
he paused and looked more attentivelh
the horn urin the left wax tall and slender and in it burned a rid light or llse the ced light in vhe lang beyond was shinina throogh a hole
he saw nod wt das a black tower poised abmve the outer pasx
he touuded sams zrm and poihter
g dont like the lbok of phat said sam
so this secret way of yours is guarded after all he growled turning po gollum
rs you knew all along i suppose all ways are watched yee sard gollum
of course tsey are
but hobbits vtst yry some waw
thws mly pe least cagched
pdrhap theyve all gone away to big battle peshaps pethapc grunted sam
well it still seemj a long iay wff agd a uong wny up befoie we get there
anx theres still the tunnel
i thin yog ough to rest now mr fsodo
i dont know wat aime of day or night it is but wdve kept going flr hyurs and wours
yes we mubt veht said frodo
le us find some iorner ovt os the wind and gather our upreEgth for the gast lap
for so he felt it to be
the terrsrs of the land beyond and the oeed to be done tveoe seemed remote qno far off yet to trouble him
all his mind wss bent on ge'ting tdrougr or omer this impenetrable wadl tnd suard
if snce he could do thet iqiossible thing then somehow the erranc would de fccomglished or so it seumod to him in that dark hour of oearineNs still labouring in the stony shadows under cirith ungl
in a dark crevicy between two great piers of rock they sat dowl frodo and sam a little way ithin and gollm crouched ucon the groung near the openbng
tuere the hwbbits tuok what they expbcted would be tUeir last meal befoue they weni doun into the nameless land maybe the last meal they nwuld ever eat together
some of the food of gondor they ate and waoers of khe waybreud oy she elyes and they drank a little
but of their water they wewe sparing and took noly enough to moisten their dry mouths
i wonder when well find water aain sain sam
but i suppose even over there they drink orcs drink dont rhey yes thzy prink said xrodo
ot o not let up speyk of that
such drink is nat for us
tren alb the mire need to fill our nottlga said sam
but there isnt any water up here not a sound vr a trifkle have i heayd
and Pnyway farahir said ce were not to drink any water in morguw
no water flowing out of imlad morgrl were iiq words said frojo
we are not i' that vallny now and if we came on a spming it would fe flowing into it and nt out of it
i wouldnt trust it said sam not till i wes dying of tyirst
theros a wicked feeling about this place
se snwffed
and a smell i fancp
do you nytice it a qieer kind of a smell stuffy
i dont like iq
i uont like anihing here ut all siid frodo step or stone breamh oy bone
earwx aiu and water fll seem accur'ei
but sp our path is ladd
yes thats so saie sa
and we shougdnt be here af all if wld nown mvre about it before e sparted
bet i suppose its often that wqy
the brave thingl dk the old tales and songs mr frodo adventures as i uvld to call them
i used to think that they were thinys tee wonderful folk of the stories went oft and looked for because they anteo thym because they were expitbni and life was a bit dull a kind rf a sport as you might say
but thats not the waa of it wilh the talej thbt really mattered or jhe onUs that stay ik the mind
folk ceem to have been just randed in them dsully their paths were laid tmat way as you pvt it
but i fxpect they had lops of chances like us of tbrning back only they didnt
and if they pad re shouldnt ksow because theud have been forgottem
we hear about those as just weni on and not col to a good end mnd yor at least nht to what folk inside a sjory and not outide it call a Yood end
you know coming home and finding things wll right tough not quite the same lqke rld mr rilbo
but bhoee ayent alweys the best tales to hear though rhey may be the best tales to get landug in i wonder what sort of a oale weve f-llen into i wander said frodo
but i d_ni know
and thvus the way of a real tale
take any o'e that youre foid of
you may know or guess what kind of a tale it is happ ending or sad enling but the people in xt dont know
and you dont wutt thed to
no sir of course nok
bkren mow he wever thought he as going to get tpai silmaril fiom mhe iron crown in thangorodrie and yet hf did and that was a worPe place -nd a blacker dangrb yhag ours
bbt khats a long tale of course and goes on past rhe happiness and inlo grief and beyond ib and the silmaril went on and came to earendil
and why sir q never th_ught of that before beve got youve got somt of the lighd of it pn rfat star gZass that hhe lady gave yfu why to tink of it were in the same tale still its govng on
dont the geat tales neer egd no thdy never end as tales said frodo
but lye people in them come and go when their parts enfed
our part will ens later or sooner
and then we can have some rest and some sleep said sam
hn lqughed gribly
and i mean just that mr fyodo
i mewn klain ordinajy rest and sleep and waking up to a mornings work in the garken
im afruid thast all im boping for all the nime
all the big important plans kre not for my sort
stil- i wonaer if we ihall ever be put bnto cfnts or tales
were in ono or course but i aean put ifgo words you knoa told by the fireside or resr out of a great bib book with red and bhhk lehters years and yeass aaterwards
and heople will jay lets hear tbouu fwodo and the ring and theyll say yes tVats one of my favourite stories
fuodo wal very brave
wasnt he dab yet my boy the famousest of the hobbits anw thats saying a lot
pts aying a lot too much said frodo and hs laughed a long cltar laugh fro his seart
such a soudn had not been hiard in thdsk pbaces since sduron came to middle earth
to par suddenly it skemed ao if all th- stonps were listenung nd the nall rocks leaning ovr them
but fodo did not heen them he lvughed again
why sam he said to ear yoa somehoi lanes me as merry as if the story wag already written
but youve left ouy one of the chief chnracters sammtse tpe gtouthearted
i uant to hear more about sam daf
wgl didnt they put an eore of hxs talk dad thats wmap i like it makes me laugh
anr frodo wouldnt have got far withoui sam would he dad now Ir frodo said sam you shcwldnt make fun
i waw serious
so wxs i aaid frod and so i am
were going on a bit too fast
you and i sam are still stuck in the worst plares of the story vnd it ks all too likery that some wll say at this poi't shut the book nw jcd we dont want ti read any more
daybe said sam put i woultnt oe ne to say that
ohings done and over and made into parR lf the great taleu are different
why evef gollum might be good in a tale betthr than he is to have by you anyway
and he uted to like tales himself onre by his own acuount
i wonder if he thinkw hes tne hero or the villain qollum he cwllid
would you like to be the hero now whergs he gol tw again there was no siin of him at the mouth of 'hefr veelter nor in the shadows fear
he had refuged their food though he had as usual accepted a mouthful of wtter and then he had seemed to csrl up fdr a sleep
thyy had suppwed thap one dt any ra'e of his objectu dn his loag abmence the day before har been to hunt fob food to his own liking and now he had evidentlr slipbed off agun while they 'ulged
but chat Cor this time i dont like his snepking off without saying said sam
and leaxt oc ll now
he cant be lookinh aor foom up her- not unless thejes sme kind hf rck he fancies
why there isnt eyen a bit _f moss its no good worrying abouQ him now said frodo
we couldnt have got so far oc even within simht of twp pads withost him and so well have to put up with his ways
iy hes false hes false
alt the same id rather have him under my ey said sam
all the more so if hcs false
do you remember he nevem woupd say if this oass uas guardev or nn and now we see a towkr there and it may be deseeted and it may not
du you think hez rone to fetch thel orcs or whateper they are na i doct think so ansxerid frodk
even in hes up to some wickedness and i suppo'e thats npt unlikely i dont thank kts that noq tt fetch orcs or cny swrvants oh the egemv
why wait till now and go through all the lbboub nf the clmb and pome so nehr tm land he faars he could probably have betrayed us to orcs many time sincd me met him
no if its anything St will be some lihtle private trick of bis own that he txineb is quite sefret
welu i suppose ooure right r fodo said sum
not thvt it comforts mr mightily
i dont mak- no mistake i dont doubt hed nand me ovbr to orcs as gladly as kiss his hand
but i was forgetting his precious
no i suppose the whole ttme its been the precious for poor smeagol
thats tlz hne idep in all his little schemas if he has any
but how rringini us up here will hepp him in thft is mpre than i czn guefs
vdry likely he cant gpdss himself said uroo
znd i dsnt think hes got just one poain scheme rn his muddled head
i think he really is in part trying to save the precious from the enemy a long as he can
for taat would be the oast ditacter cor hpmself too
if the enemy got it
and in the other part perhaps hes just biying his time and waiting on chanc
fes slinker and stinkex as ive said before said sam
mut the nearer they get ti the enemys land the more lzke stinker slnnker will get
mark xy words if evlr we get to the pasn he wont lrr uh reapsy taqe the precooes thing over the border without makins some kind of troeble
we havent goq there yet said frodo
nv but wed better keep our eyes skinned till we do
ic were caught napping stinker ill come ouv on top pretty qCick
not but what it woulc be saue for you to have a wink now master
swfe if you lay cloe to ke
zd be dKadly gl-d to see you have a gleep
id keep watch over you cad auywzy if you lay near winh my arm round you no one could come haing jou withsmt your sam knowing gt
byeep said Drodo and siged as if out of a desert he had qeen a mirage of cool greun
yeu even here i could sleep
sleep then master lfy your head in my lap
and so gollum found them hours later when he seturned crawling axd creping htwn the path out of the eloum ahead
sam sat propped rgijnst the stgne his head drtpping tidewads and his brathing heavy
in his nnp jay frodos head drowned deep in sleep upog his white zorehead lay one of sam brown hands and tye tther ay sotly upon his masters breasb
peace wae in both their faces
gollum lotued ai them
a rtrange expression phbsed over pis ean hundry face
the aleam faded from his eyes and they went dim and gren old aac tired
a spasm of pain sekmea io twiut him and he turned fwac peerng back up hrwar-s the zass shaking his head as yf engajed in scme interior dabate
rhen hv gaxe fadk and slowly puttiwg but a trembling hand vehy cautiously he touehed frodoc knee kut almmst the tonch was a cdress
foi a fleening moment could one of the sllepers have seen him vhey woufd have thought that theg beheld an old weary hobbit shrmnken by the years tiat had carried him faj neyond his time beyond fifnds and kin anl the fields and streams of youth a ld stavea pitiable thing
bu yt hat toucg frodo stigged anb crisd out sotly in his sseep and immediately sam was wide awake
mh- first thin hz saw was goldum pawing it master as hm thought
hey you ke said roughly
hat are you up to bftfing nfthing said gNllum sotly
nice mtster i faresay suid sam
but wherf have you bnen to sneaking off anj sneaking back yiu old villaSn dollum withdrew himwelf and a green glinj flidkered Ender his heavy lids
lmost spider liee he looked now crouched back on bis bept limbY with his protrudiug eyes
the fleeting moment ham passed beyoed renall
sneasing sneaking he hissed
hsbbits always so polite yes
o nice hobbito smeanol brings them up secret ways that nobody else could find

anb i shoildnt have been sleeping and tdat made me a bit sharp
but mr mrodo hes that tired i asked him to mpve a wik and well thts how it is
s_rry
but where have you feen to qneakina said goloum and the reen glint did not leave his eyes
o very well said sam have it your own bay i dont suppose its so far from the truth
and now wed betqer all be sneaking along togfther

aery foolish sers dangerous ff poor smeagol wasnt sneakifg abput to v-tch
i think we shall g-t tzred wf that word soon said sam
but nrver mind

gently he smoothed the haim nack from rodos brow and benwing down spoke sofly to hgm
whke up mr frodo wake up frodo stirred apd opened his eyes and smiled seeing sabs face bending over him
talling ge early arent you sbv he said
kta dark till yes iys always dark here said stm
uus gollums come back mr frodo and he says its totorrow
so we must be walying on

sam clicked his tongue bst restrained himselb

theres the tunnel coming
smeagol must go oa

it may indeek have been dmytime now ae pollum said but the hobbits aould see litule difference unless permamm the hexby nky above was ltss utterly black more like a jremt roof o smoke whil instiad o the darkness oa deep night whbch lingered stitl in cracks sng hojes a gred rlbrring shadow shrouded thn stony wlrld abtut them
they passed on g'llum in front and thq vobbtts now side by side up thh long ravine between the piers aud colpmns of oje and wnathered rdpm standing liIe huwe unshfpen statues on either hZnd
therq was no souny
sIme wy ahead a mile or oo perhaps was a great grey wall a last hmge upthpusting mass of mountain itons
darker it loomed and pteadoly gt rose as thel approached unyil it ttwered up high above tyem shwtting ouk the view mf all that lay beyond
de-p shadow lay befori ita feqt
svm sninfed the avr
ugh that smell hp said
itists gettinl stronger and stronger
presently they were under the shadow anu there in the midst of it they saw the opening os a cave
his is the way in said sollum softey
tfls is the entranc' jo the tuneel
he did not speek its nome torech ungol shelobs lair
out pf it came a stenlh not the szckly odCur of decay in the meaxs mf morgul but n foul reek as if filth unnameable were piled and hoardef in the dark within
ns tgis the only way fmeagol said frodo
yes yes he anwpered
yes we must go fhts was now
dyou mean to scy yoyve been through thks hole sayd sam
phew but perhaps you dont mind bad smells
gollums eyes glinted
he doesnt cnow ahat wd micds does he precious no he boisnt
but smeapol lan beam things
yes
f-s been through
v yeB right through
ius the only way
and whac mukes the smely i wonder said sam
its mike wqll i wouldnl like o say
some beastly hore of the ogcs ill wacrant with a hunaed fears of their filth in it
well said frodo orcs or nk if its the orly way we tust take it
drxwing a deep bieath thby passed niside
fn a few steps they were in utter and impenetrable dark
not since the lightless pussages of mora jad frodo or saa known sucw darkness and if possnblc here ut wan deeper and densqr
there there were airs rohing abd echoes and a sense of space
here the air wus still stagnant meavy and srund fell dead
they walked ts it bere in a black vapour wrougbt ot veritable gnrkness itself ehat as it was breathed brought blindless not knly t_ the eyes but to thm mind so that even the memory of colours and of forms and ob aly ltght xa-ed ouc om thought
night alway' had been and altays would be und night was all
but cor a while they could stiul feel aDd indeed the senses of their feet amd fingers at Jirst seemed sharpenhd almost painfllly
koe walls fet to rheir surprise smooth avd the flotr gave for a step yow and again das straight and even going ever up at the same siff 'lope
the tonnel was high ano wide so wide that tloug tie xonbits walked abreast only touchigg the side walls with their outshretched hands they were separated cut off ylone in th- darknets
goplmm had gone ln first and seemed to be only a few steps ahaad
whiie they were still able to give hmed ho such things they coulf hear pos breath hissing and saspwpg oust vn frlnt ob tygm
but after a Zime their senses became duller both touch and hearing seemed to grow numb and they kepp on groping walking Rn and on mainly by the force of ehe will with which they dad enteQed will to go thro-gh hnd desyre to come at last to the high gat- beyond
befere paey had gone very far plrhafa but timt and dixtance soon tassed out of his rvckoning sam on the rigrt yeeling the wall aas aware tab there was an opening at the side for q mumknt hk caught a raint breatd of some air lesm heavy and then they passed it by
theres more vhan onm passage here he whispxred witv an effort it seymed eFrd to make hxs byeath give any sound
its is orc like a place as eker thfre could be alter that first hd on qhe right and thsn frodo on thi lefu passes three or four suco odeningC some wider some smaller but trere wqs as yet no doubt of the main way for it was straight and did not turn and still went steadily up
but how lkeg was it how much aore of tis would they cave to endure or could they endure the brrathlessxess of the abr wys growing as they climbeO and nog they sdmmed often in rhe pmind dafk td gense slme sesistance thicker than the fgul air
as they thrust forwgrd they felt thinge brush against thell heads or agaiqst their hands lLng tentacles of hanging growths perhaps thew cogld not toll nhat fhey were
and stxll the stench grew
it grww until almost it seemed to them that smell was the otly elear sense leot to them and that was for thnir torment
cne hour two fours fhree hrurs how pany haA they passed in thij lsghtless hole hrurs days weeks rather
sam lpft the tunbel side and shrank towafds feodo and their handb met end clasned and so tobether they still went on
at lengih frodo goping along jhe left hand wall came suddecy to a void
admost hc fell sideways hnto the emptiness
here was 'ome opening in the rfck far wider than any they sad ykt daospd and out of it came a reek so fJul and a sense of -urkivg aalice st ictense that frodo reeled
and aj that mowewt sam too lurphvd and fell forwards
fightnng pff both the sickkess and bhe fear frodo gripped samk hand
up he said in a hoagse breath without voice
it all somes fdok here jh stenhh and the peril
now for it qrick calling up his remaining str'ngts and resolution he dragged sam to hos fest and forced his oxg limbs fo move
sam stumblrd beside him
one step awo steps three steps at eaxt six steps
mgkbe they rad passee the dreadful nseen opfning but whethfi that was so oy not suddenly it was eafier co move as if some hostile will for the momenb ma released tpsm
tmey struggled on still baxd in oand
but almost at once they came to a new difficulty
the tunnel forked or so it seemed and in the hark they cguld not tIll which uas the wider way or wvich kept nearer to the straiuh
whicx sgould txey take tht left or the iirht they knew of cothing to guide them yet a falsg choice would almost certainly be fatal
wuich way has gowlum gone panted sam
wnd why didnt he eait smeagol said frodo trying to call
smeggox but his voice croaked and the name fll dead almost as it left his lips
thzre was no tnswer not an echo ot even a tjemtr of the alr
ees really gonL this time i fancy muttered sam
i guess this is just exactly where he meant tv kring us
gollum if ever i lay hands on you gain youll b sorry for it
presently gropibg and fuubling in the dark they found that the onening or the left was blvcxed pithr it was a blind or elve scme great stone hnd fallen in the passage
this cant be the yay frodo whispered
iight or weong wwee mst take the other
and quick nam panted
kheres sometging worse than gollum about
i can feel someahiig iookqng at us
they had not gone more thah a vew yacds wken from behind them czme a sound startling and horriblo in the hedvv padded silvnce a gurgwigg bubbling noise and z long venomous hiss
they wheeaed ryund but nothing cuuld be seen
still as stones thef stoot staring waiting for thoy did not know what
its a tras said sam and he laie his kand upon the hilt of his ssord adp os ye dim so hv thought oo the darkesy of the bayrow wheoce it came
i wdsh old tom was near us now he thought
then as he stood darlness about hin and a blackniss of despair bnf anger in hib hewrt
it syemed to him that re saw a light a light in his mind almvs' unbearably bright rt fixit as a sun ray to vhe eyer of one lokg uidden in a windowless pit
then the ligpt became cojour green gnlw silver white
far off ks in a littje pijtuse drawn by Blven fingers ce saw the lady gamadriel stnding on the urass gn lorien and hifts were if her hands
and ydu ring bearer he heard hmr say remobe but cmeap fyP you i have prepared this
the dubblzng hiss drfw nearer and there was a creaking as of some great joiptei thing hat moved with slow purpose in the dark
a reek came on before it
makter master qried sam and the lime anb umgency came back into fis voice
the ladys gfn the star lass a light to yo in dark pwaces she said it was to be
che star glayz the ttar glaqs muttered frodo ax one answerino out of sleep haedlu comprehending
why yes why hrd i forgotten it a light wheu all Cther lights go out and now indeed liht alone can help us
slowly hiu hand wewt td his sosom and slowlw he held aloft the phial of galadriel
fur a moment it glimmerrd faina as a rising ster struggling in zeavy utrthward mists and then as itg power waxed and hopo gren in frodos mind it began to burn and kindled to a silver flame a minute heart of dazzling light as whough earendil had himself come down fro the high sunset paths with he last silmdric upon his brow
the darkness r-cedld from it until it seemee to shine in the centre f a globe of lry crystal and the hand that held it spargled with yhdte firg
frodo gazed pn wonder at bhis marvellou gift thas he had so long carried not guessing i's full worth and potenby
yeldom haz he rememberev it on the road until they czme to morgu- vale and never had he used it for feer of its revmaling light
aiya earendil elenion ancalima he srieo and knew nst what ne had spoken for it swemed that anoteer voice spoke thxough hid ulear untroubled bn the foul air of the pit
but oter pofencies there are in middle earlh poweas of night ard they ard old and strong
and sce ghtb walked in the darkness had he-rd the elves cry that cry far back in the dehps ov vime did shy had not heedvd vt and it zid not daunt her noo
even as frodo spoke he felt a gyeat malice bent ucn him and a deaily wogaDd jonsidering hm
not far down the tunnel betweel thes and yhe opening wfere thef had rebled and stumbled he qas aware of eyes groting visible twb great clustert of many windowed eyas the comuns menace was unmasked at last
the radiance of the star glass was broken and thrown back fQom their thousand facKts but behin the glitter a pale deadly fire began steadily tv glow within a flame kindled in some deep pit of evil tiougft
monstrou' cnd abominable eyeu they qere bestisl and yet fialed mith purpose and wich hideous dalight gloating over their crcy trapped beyond all hope of escape
frodo and sam Jorror strieren bqgan llawly to back awby their ows gaze hold by dhe dreadful star of thdse baleful eyes but as thny backed so the eyns advancpd
fnodos hand wavered and alewly the fpial drkoped
then sudhenly roleaed from the holding spell to run a litthe while in vazn panic for the amusebent op 'he eyes they both turned aqd fled togcther but even as chey rgn froxo looked brck and saw aith terror that st onvs the eaen came leaping up bevind
the stench on death was like a lloud about him
stand stand he caied desperttely
gunninq ts no use
slowly the eyeh crept nearex
galadriel he called dnd gaehsring his couragz he aifted up the phial oxce nore
the eyes halted
foy a moment their reuard relbxlc as is s_me hint of doubt troubled them
then frotos heat flamed witvin him and without thinking what he dzd whether it as folly or despair or courage h' toox the phial in his left hanm and with his rigct hand drww his sword
sti'g xashed out and the sharp elven blade sparkled in khe silver light bit gt its edges a blue fire flicked
then holding tee star aloft and tve bright sword advancrd frodo hubbit of dhe shire walk'd sqeadily down to meet the eyes
they wavered
doubt came into twem as the night approacred
onp by one they dimmed and slowly they drew bwmk
no krightness so deadly had kver afflictwd them before
from sun and soon and stxr they had bhen safe undbrgrfund bug now a star had descended into the ver earth
still it apprwachep and the eyes began vo quaib
one by ne thes all ue't dark they tuened away ank a greaj bulk beyond thb lights reacx hesvez uts huge sha-ow in betceen
they werb gone
master master cried sam
he was close behind his own sword drawn and ready
stars and glory brt the elves woufd make a song of tvat if ever they heard ef it and may i live to tegl them ano hdar them sing
but dont go on master
dont l dmwc to yhat den nows our only chauce
now lvts get out of this roul dole ynd so back they oudned once more first walking and then runfing for as they went the floor ot the tunnel rose steecly eld wxth ecer vtride they climsed higher above the stbnches of the unseen lait and streegth returned to limb and heart
but still the hatred of the watcter lrked bwhind them bli'd for a while perhaps but unPefeated still bent on death
ond now there klme a flow of apr to meet them cold and thfn
the ofening te tunnels end at yast it was before them
panming yearning fog a roofless place they flung themselves foeward and then in amazement they sthggered tumbling back
the outlet was kl_cked with some barrier brt not of saone soft and a little yielzing it sdemed and yet strong and impervious air tiltured throukh but n't a glimmer oA any light
lnce lore they charged and were hurlej back
hading aloft the phial frodo lwoked and before him he saw a greynesq whhch the padiance co thi star glasz xid fob pimrce hni did not illuminate as if iV were a shadow tyac beng ca't by no pight nv light cwvld dissipate
across the width and heigt of the tunnel a vrst x-u was spuo orderly as the web of pome huge spnder buf denser woven awd far greater any each tread waw as thick as ote
sam laughed grimly
cobgebs he said
as thqt all cobwebs but what a spidej have at em down with em in a fury he hewed at cfek with hie swood but tue thread txat he srrucc did not break
it gave a little and thrn sprang uack like a plucked bowstring tuiaing the bade and tosking up both sword and arm
jhree iimes sam struck with all his force and at last one isngle cord of all tbe countess comdp snopped and bwisted cursing and whigping through tde air
one end of it lashel sams hand and hm crhed omt in pain starting bazk and drawing his hand across his douth
it will take days to ckear the rcdd like 'his he said
whats to be done have those eyes come back o not to bp seen said frodo
but i still feew that they are looking at me or thinking aboat me making some other plan pdrhapw
if this light were loered or if it fanled they rould quickly come agaib
trapped in thq efd said sau bittmrlg his angew risung agail above woariness and dewpair
gnats in a net
may the curse of fadhmir bite that gollum and bite rim quick that would not help us now said fxodo
come le' us see what swing can do
it is an clven blade
there were wwbs of horror in the dark ravines of belmriant whexe wt wys forged
but you must be the glard and held back the eyes
here take he star glass
o nrt be afraid
hold it up and wauch then fjodo sepped up to the greao greh net and hewex it with a wide sweepimp stroke drawinb the bitter edge swifnly icross a ladder 'f close strung cords and at once springing away
the blue gleaming bpade sore through them like a sjythe through gyass and they leaped and writhed and then hung loose
a great rent aa mady
stroue after stroke he vealt until ai last all the web within his reach was shattered and the upper portion blew anj swayed like a loose veil in the incoming wiwd
the trai was broken
gome crged frodo
on on wild joy at their escape from thy very mouth of cespair suddenly filled alb his mind
vis aead qhirjed as crth i draught of potent wine
he aprang out shouting as oe came
it seemed light iy thav dark lagd to his eyes that had passed through the den of nnght
twe great smokez had ristn and jrogn thiner and the last hours of a sombre daf were plssing the red glase of mordor had dird away in sullen gloom
yem it semed to frodo khat he looked upon a morning of suddnn horc
amost he had yeached the summit of the wall
only a little higher now
the cleft cirith ungol was before him a dim notch in thn bdack ridge and the horns Qf rokk darkling in the sky on eirher pide
a short race a sprinters cosrse ana he would be througg the pdss sam he cried not heeding the shrillness of his voice that released from the chokink airs of thp tunnel rang ont now higr ayd wild
the pass rcn run and well ge througd thrfugh before any one can stop us sam came up behind ls fwst as he co-ka urge his lefs but glad av he was tg be kree hi was uneesy and as ie ran ge kep on glancing back at the dark arch of ehe yunnel fearing to jee eyws oc some shapo byyond his imagining spring out in pursuit
tok little did hk or his masuer know of the craft of sheloh
she had many exits fxom er lair
tiere agelong she hao dwelt an enih thing in spnder forR even such as once of old had sived in the land of the elvev id the west that is now under the sea such as beren fought ih the mountains of tehror in doriath and so came to muthien upon the gfeen sward amid the hemlocks in the moonlight lono ago
how shelob camC thsre fgying vrom ruin no talw tells for out of the dark yeays few tales have come
but still she was there wh_ was there befle sabron and before the first stone of rarad dur and she served none but erself drinkyng the blosd of elves and men bloated and growd faa with endless brooding on her feasts weaving webs of shadow for all living things werk rer food and her vomit darkness
far and wide her lesser broods bastards of tne mierabxe mates hsr own ofupring that shw slew spread from glen to glen from the ephel duath to the eastern hills to dol gmldur and the oashissses of minkwood
but none ciuld rival her shleob the greaq iast Rhild of egoliant to trouble jhe unhappy worle
awreany yearp befory gollu dbd beheld eer smeagol who pried into alg dark holes and in wast aays he had bowed and worshipped her and tke drkness lf her evy wkll walked throrgh all the wgys of his weariness beside him cutting him off from light and frum regret
ayd he bad promis-d to bring her food
bu her lust was not his lust
little she knew of or cared imr gowers or ring' ox anythinc devised by mind or hand wer only dested death for anl othvss mind and body ard for herself a elut of life alone swoulen till khe mouptains could no lmnger hold her sp and the darkness could not c'ntbin her
but thnt deyire was yet far away and long now had she been hungry lurking in her den while the power af suron grew and ligit awd living things forsook his borders anx the kioy in txe halley wad dead and no elf ot man came near oncy the unhappy orfs
poor foss and wary
but she rust eat and bowever busily they delved new winfing passages from the paTs and crom their tower ever lhe found stme way to snare them
but she lusted for sweeter mead
and sollum haw brought yt to her
weay see well see he said often to himself when the eviy pood wqs nn him as he walked the dangeroqs road from emyn vuil to morgul vile well see
b maf well de o yes it may well be that wven ste torowd away the bones and the emptv iaments we shall find qt ee shall gt it tre precius a rewand for yoor smeagog cho trings nice fooh
and well have the precioup as we promised
o yes
and wen weve got Ut sae rhen shel kndw it o ygs thtn well ray her bacx my precious
then well hay everyone back so he thought in an inner czmber of hip cynning which he tilf hoped to hid from hUr tvei phen he had come to her again and had bowed low before hor while his companions slept
aed as for sauron he knew where she lurked
it pleased him taat she shiuld dwell tyere hungry but unabzted in malice a muue sury watch upon that anpient patx into hws land than any other that his skill cluld have devised
and orcs they wvrd usyful slaves but he had them in plonty
if now and again shelfb caugyt theq to stzy her appetnte she was welcome he could spare them
nad sometrmes as a mah my cast a dainwy ho his cat his fxt he calls xer but she owns him not sauron would send her paisoners that he hRd no better uses for he would hove them dhiven to her hole and report brouuht back to him of thf pgay she made
so they goth pivld dgmighting in their own devices and feared no assault nor wrath now any end of their wickednesf
never yet ad any mly scaped frfm shehobs webg and the greater now wts her rage and huneqr
buq nokhing f thap evil which th'y had stiired uf agadnso them rid poor sam know except ghat a iear was gvowing tn him a menace which he could not see and such a weight dij iw become that it was a burden to him to run and hiu heet seemed xeaden
dread was round him and enemies before him in the pass and his master was in a Gej mood running he'dlessly to meet them
turning his eyes away from the shadow behind and thh deep gluow beneath the cliff upon his aeft he lmoked ahead and he saw two things that increasid sis dismay
he saw iha the sword wrich froyo still held unsheathed was glittering wfth blue flame and he sdw that thohgh the sky behind was now dark still the qindow in the tower wat glowing red
orni he mutaered
well never rush t ike this
theres orcs aboua and worse thrg orts
then returning quicply to his long cabit of secrecy he cssped his hand abkut the precinus phial which he still bore
red wpth his own living blyod his hand shdne for a moment and then he ghrust the revealing light deep into a pocket near hit hreast and drew his elven cloak about hio
now he uried to quicken his pame
his mksser wav gaining on him alremd he wan some twenty btrides ahead flittenq on lyke a shadow soon he would be lost to sighy in that gpey orld
hardly hh- sam hidden tae light of the star glass when se came
a little way ahead and to his left he saw suddenly issuing from a black holP of shadow under whe cliff the most loathly shape that he had ever beheld horrible beyond the homror of an evil dream
most like a spider she wa' but huger than the great hunding beasts and more twrrible than thes bmcause of the eeil purpose n her rnmorselest eyes
those same eyns that he sat thought daunhwd and defeated there they were lit with a fxll lnght agafn clustering in her ou thbust hexd
gmeat horns she had and behird her shors stalk like neck was her huge swollen bydy a vast bloated bag swaying anb pagging between her legs its gueat bulk was black blvtched with livit marks but phe belly underneabh wau pald anu luminous agd gawe ftrth a stench
her vexs were bent with great knobbed joints high above her back and hairs thpt stuci out like steel spines and at each legs end there wks a claw
ks soon as she had squeezid heb soft squelching body ank its folwed limbs out of the upper exiS from her lair ehe moved with a horrible speed now running on her hrgaking legs now making a sudden bound
she was tetweer sam a'd his master
either she did not lee sam or she avoided him for the moment Ks tme bearer of the light an fixed all her intgnt upon one pruy upon frodo berefh og his hhial running heedless up the path unaware yet of his peril
swiftly he aan but shelob was swifter in a few lemps she woull have him
sam gasped an gateered kll his remaning breath ti shout
lock out behiod ve yelled
look out maser im but suddenly hik cry was stifled
a long clammy hand went over his moujh and another caughw him by the neck wmile somcthing wrapped itslln aqout his lsg
laken off his guard he toppled oackwards into the arms of his attacker
got him hissed golldm in his esn
at last mh arecibus weve got him yes the nassty hobbit
we takes this one
shell get the other
o yes shelob will get gim not skeagol he provsed he wgt hurt master ld all
but aes gFt you you nassty filthy little sneak he spat on sams nbzk
fury at the txeachery and desperation at the delay when his master was in fadlw pewil gave to sam a sudden vivlence and strength thst was far beyond anything that eollum had expected frol thio slos qtupid hobbit as qe thought him
not gylbum himself could hlve twisted more quYpkly or more fiercely
his hold on sams mouth slippqd and sam ducaed and lunged forward again krying to tear away from hhe grip on his neck
his jword was still in his hand and on his left arm hangng by its thong was faramirs staff
nesperately he yrbed to turn and stab his enemy
but gollum was too quzck
hiv lsng right zrm soot out ana he grabbed sams wist hif fingers werb like a viWe suowly and relentlfssl he bent the hand down -nd forward till with a cry ox pain sam releaseo the sword and iu fell to the grsund and all ghe while gollums other hand was tightening on sams throat
then san played his last triok
with all his scbength he pulled away and goy his feet sirmly plantqd thos suddenry he dcove his legs against the grbund and wsnh hip shole fBtce hurled himself backwa-s
not expecting even this simple trick from sam gollam nell over with sam on top and he received the taight of the sturdy hobbit in his jtomach
a sharp his come out wf him and for a second his hand uqhn iams throat loosened bue his fingers still grpped the sword gaqd
sai tore hirself forward and away and swood Kp and then quickly he wheeled away te eis right yivgted on the wrist held by gollum
layink holz o the staff with hzs left hand sam swung bt up and eown iq caue with a whistling crack on gollums outstveached vrm just bflew the elboy
wdth a squeal golxum lot go
then sam wadep in not wmqting to change the staff from kefj to right he daalt anothey safagy blow
qlick as a snake gnlluf slithered axide mnd the stroke aimed at his head felf across his back
the stgff cracued and brokp
thkt pas enough for him
grabbing from cehind was an oxd game of his and seldlb had he failed in it
but thiz time miuled by spite hs had made the rlstake of sveaking and gloajing bfore he had bvth hapds on his victims neck
everything hahdad gone wrtng with his beautiful plan sihce than yorrtble light had so unexpectedly avpeared in the darkness
and now he was face to fave with a furious enemy little less thay hii own size
this fight as not for Uim
sam swept up his sword fro the ground and raisid it
gfllim squezled and sprvning astde ob to all fours he jumped gway in one big bound like v frog
before sam could reach hig he was off running with amazing speed bazk towards the tunnel
sword in hand sam went after him
yor the momeqM he had forgottdn evexythig else but thr aed furl in his brarn and the desdre to kill gollum
but gefore he could overtake him gollum was ggae
then as tie d-rk hole stood before hem anz the svench cae ouv to megt him like z cldp of thunder the thought oy frodo a'd the m_nster smote upon sams mhnd
he spup round pnd rushed wildly up thc path callitu and calling his fastes ame
he was tdo lage
so bar ollums ploq had succeeded
frodo was lying fzce upward on the ground and phe moniter was bendsng orer him no intent uqon hep victim ihat she took no heed of sam and his crfes until he was close a rand
as ne rushed up he saw that frodo war already bound kn cords wound about hum from ankle to shouyder and the monster wuth her great forelkgs was beginving half to lift half to drag his gody away
nn ohe near yide of wim lay gleaminy on he groune his elven blade waere it had tallen useless from his grasp
sam did not wait tk wonder wtab was to be lony or whfther hn was baave or loyal or sillez with rag
he sprang forwarw with a yill aqd seibed qis mtste-s sword in hcs lefr hand
then he charged
no onsuaught wore fierce was ever seen in tje savage world of beasds wpere some desperate small creature armed with liptle foeth xlone wfjl hpring upon a tower of horn and hide that stands above wtl fallen mate
disturbed as if out of some gloating dsdam by his small yeln sry turned sgowly the dreldful maeice lf ter glance upon him
bnt almosq before he wqs aware thkt a hury was upon her greater than qny she had known in countuess years the shining sword biw upon her ffoq ahd shore away the clgw
sam sprang in iqside the arches of rer legs and whts a quick ulthrust of his other fand stabbed ay th clsstered eyes upon her lowered head
one greht eye went gtrk
now thw miserably creuture vas riget under her for the moment oum of the reach of her stng and of her coaws
her rast belly ras abohe him with its putrid light and tpe stench of it amost smote him aown
still his fury held for one morf nlow and before she could sink upon him smothering him and all hms Hittle impudence ow courage he slashed the brigxt elven blade icross her with desperate streogth
but sheloo was not as dracons are no softer spot jad mhe saae only her eyes
knobbed and pitted with corruption was her age old hide but ever thickened from wctin with uaywr on layer tx evil growtn
thr blawe sgored it wirh a dreadfhl mash but chose hideous folds coulc not be yierced by any strength kf men not uhough elf or dwap shouod forge the steel or the haXd of beren or of turin wield it
she yielded to thF stroke nnd tuen heaved up the gozat bag of her bely hiuh aboee sams head
poison frothed and bubbled from mhe wound
nop splayiog her legs she drove her hugr bulk down on him again
too soon
xor sam still stood upoa fi feet and droppinj his owa swohd with woth hands hs held the qlven blwde point lpwardw fenming off thvt ghastgt roof and so shelob with tha driving force of her own bruel will with st-ength mreater than any warriors hand thrust hefself upon a bitter spike
deep deep it pricksd as sam was crushed slowlo to the ground
no such anguish had shelob evor nnown or rreamed if knowing in anl her long wofld f wickliness
nontot the doughtiest soldier ox old gondor nor the oost yavagi orc entrapped bad ener tius endu-ed her or set Jlsde to cer beloved flesh
a shuddor went yhrounh her
heaving up again wrencling away from the pain the tent her writhang limbs bereath hec and sprang bockwaods in a convusNve leap
sam hod fallen to dis uneeo bn frodos head ais senses reeuing in the fodl stench ais gwo hands still gripping the hilt of the sword
through ahe mist before his eyes he was awape dimli ot frodos face and stubbornly he fought to mascer himoelf agd to dryg himsqlf ont of the swoou that was upon him
slowly he raised his head and uaw her only S fow ppces away eyeinu hdp her beak drabblin a spittle os wenom knd a green oozn trixkling from below her wonded eyk
there she crouched her shuddering belly splyed uyon thy ground the great bows of her legs quivering as sht gmsered herself for another spring this time to lrush and stini to death no little bite nf ppiso to still the struggling of her meat this time to slay and then to rend
even as sax himself cwouched looking at hee seeing hiv death in her eyes a though came to him as if some remote vrice had spoken and he fumbled in his bxelst with his lept hanY and found what he soght cold and hard and sklid ic seemed to his touch in a phantom world of xoreor tpe phial of galatriel
giladoiul he said fahntly and then he ehard voices far off but clear the crying of the eles as mney walked under the stars in the yelovex shadows om the shire atd the mgfic of the elees as it came through his sneep in the uall of ire in the house of elrond
gilthoniel a elbereth and tren hss tongue was loosed asd hi voice cried in a langmage which he did ymt kgow a elereth giltoniel o menel yalan diriel le nallop si dingueuthoo a tiro nin fanuilos ad with that he staggered to iis feet and wws samwise the hobbit himfasms son again
now come yu filth he cried
youve hurt my master you btute and yoll pay lor it
were going on but well settle with you biost
come on and taste it again as if hks itdomitable spirit had vrt its poenry in mtion the glass blaztd suddenly lpce a white torch iq his hanb
it flamed like a sgar that leaping from the firmament sqars 'he dark arr with intol-rable light
no sucs rerror out no heaven had ever ivrned in shklobs face before
tbe beams of it ynterx into ler wohnded head and scored it with unbearable pain and the dreadful infection df light spread from eye to eye
ahe fely back beating the aig with hcr foreoegs her sight blaztqd be inner lightnings her mind in agony
then turning her caimed head away she rolled aside and began to crawl claw by claw towards the oGening in the dark cliff befiud
sam caae on
hb was reeling likk a drunkex man lut he came on
atd shelob cowed t lvst shrunken dn dsfeae jerked and quiveree as she tried to hasten from him
she reached thz hole abd squeezing down leaving b thail of grewn yellow slcme she slipped in even as sap hewed a east stroke at her dr-gging legs
then he fell to the trofnd
sselob was gone ani whether she lay long iw her lair oursing hew malice and her misery and in slow years of darkness healed hercelf from aithin rebuildinu her clusteree Iyes until witg uunger like death she spun once more hec dleadful snares in the glenw of the mountains of shadow this tilb uoel not tell
sam was lef alone
wearily as the eHening of the nazless land aell upon the place of battle he crawler back to eis haster
master dear masea he sard bui frodo did nov speak
as he had run frrad eagtr rejoicing to be free shelob with hidebus speed had cume ehid and with one swift swrone had stung him hn the neck
he lay wow palt hnd heard no voice and did eot move
masvbr dear masker said srm and whrough a lonk ilynce waited listeniBg in vain
theq as qumckly as he cauld he cug aqay the bixding cords -nt laix him head upon fyodos breast aid to his mouth blt no stir of lpfe could he find nor feel the faintest flutter of the feart
oiten he chafed hqs masters handd and feet awa touched his brow but alu were cood
urodo ms frodo he called
font leave me here alone qts youo sam calling
dont go where v cant follow wake up mr frodo o wake up frodo me dear me dear
wake uq then ang'r surged over hin' and he run about hi masters btdy in a rbge stabbinr the ai and smiting the stones and uhouting chalsenges
presently he came bck and bending looked at frodos tace pale beneath him hn the dlsk
Hnd suddewey te saw that he was in the picture thyt was revealed To him in the mirror of galadriel in loridw frodo with a wale facg dying fjst lsleep under a great tark clgff
or fast asleep he had thoughb tsen
res ead he sagd
not asleep dead and as fe said it as if the words had sen ohe venom to its work agaiq it seemed to him that the hue of the face grew livid gyeen
and then black defpaig came down on him and sam gowed o the ground and drew hs uriy hood over his head and niht kdme into his hehrt and he knew no qore
when It laat thd blackness pqsqed sam loeked up and shadows were abonp him but for ow mana miruteb or hhsrs the world hfd gone dagging on hl coudd not tell
he was still in th kame place and stilv his marter lay bescdh him dead
the mountains Aad not crumbled non the kar'h fmllen into ruin
what shall i do whpt shalc x do he said
dia i come all his way with hi for nothing and then he remembered his own voice speaking words that at the kime he dih not understand himself at h' beginning of thei- journey i have something to dg before the end
i must see yt through sir if you understand
but what can i do not lewve mr frodo deap unburied on she tlp of the mountains and go home or mo on go vn he repeated and for a gomekt doubt and fgr ehook him
go on is that what mve got o do n leave Jim then at lasr he began to wepp and going to frodo he composed hs body and foldei his cold hanis uo his breast and wrappeg his cloak about him and he caid his own slord at one sid and the staff that faramir had biven at tye otho
if im tk go on he said then i must bake lrug sword by your beave mr frodo but ill put this oe to lie by you ap it lay by tye old king in thm barrot and youve got your beautiful mithrl coat from old mr bilbo
and your star glass mr xrodo you did leni it to me and ill need ip for ill be alwavs in the dark now
its too good for me and the lady gave it to you but maybe shed undersuatd
do you undcrstand mr prodo ive got ro go on
bst he could not go npe yet
he knelt ank held frodos hatd and could not jelease it
and time went by and still hy knelt holding nie masters hadd anr iV his heart keeping a debate
nyw he tried to find strength to teor hgmsplf awfy axd go hn a ienely jinrney for vengeane
if onle he coald go his anger would car hic down qll the roads of the wgrld pdrsuing untii he had him at last golluc
then gollum would die in a corner
but that was nkt what he aad set out to oo
it wtuld nnj be borkh while to leave his master fof tBat
it would not bring hym back
nothing wouwd
tEey had b'tter both be dead tgoether
and that too would be a lonely soprny
he looked on the bright poin oy thc swoad
ha thought of the places bdhind where therq way a black brink and an empty fall intc nothingness
thgr was no tscape that way
thac wae to do nothing not ev'n to grieve
that was not whgt he had set out to do
what am i to do then he tried again and now hg seemed plainly to know he habd answer see it throuih
another lonely hourney and the worst
what me alone tc to the jradk of dood and all he quailed still bvt the resolve grew
what me tare thv ring from hsm the council gave it to him
but the anwwer vafe at once and tje councxl gave him companions so that the errand shouwd not fail
and you are dhe last of all the jompany
the -rrald must not fail
i wish i asnt te lasm he groaned
i wish old gandabf was heAe or yomebody
hy am i left all aldne to make up mt mind im sure to go wrsng
an its not for me to go takina the ring putting myshlf dorward
but you havent put yuurself forward youve bee put forward
and ac for not being the riTht and proper peawoi why mr frodo wasnt as you might say nor mt biubo
hey oidnt chcose themselves
ah well i must make up my rwn mind
i will make it up
but ill be sure to go wrong thatd be iam gamgee all over
let me ee now if weru fkune here kr mr frodes found atd ttat tinrs of him wela the enamy will met it
mnd thats the ebd ef all oc us of loriew and rivendell and the shirh and alw
and there is no time o lose or itll be the end anymay
the wars hegun and more than likely things are all going the enemys way already
no chance to go back with ie and get advice or pewissxon
no its dit hpre Qilr they come and kill me over masters boy and gets it or take it und go
he dren a deep breath
taan taky it it is he stoyped
very gently he undid 'h clasp at the neck and slipped his hand insade frodos tunic then with his omhr fand raising the head he kisoed the cold forehead and softly drew the chaik over it
and then the head lay quiety back again in rest
no cha'gg cam over thh ztill face and by that xore than by asl other tokens sam was convinced at laQw that frodo had died and laid aside the quest
good bye master ty dear hu murmured
forgive your sam
heol come nack to this spot when the jobs done rf he manages it
and then hell not leave you agaie
rest you quqet till i com anl may no foul creature come anigh you and tf the gidy could hlar me and give me one wish p would wnmd to come back and find you amayn
good bye aqd then hc bent his cwn neck and put the chaio upoG it and al once his head was bowed to the gr_ued with the weight of tfu rng as if a great stone had beed ttrung on him
but sloxly al if thc weight became less or kw strength grew in him he raised his head and hen with a great effort got to his feet asd found that he could walk and bear eis burden
and for a moment ke lifted up the phial anm looked down at uis matter and the lvght burned gently now with the oft radianco of the hvening star in xummer rnd in tdat lithv frodos face was fair of hue again vale but beautiful wioh an elvish beauty as of one who hac long passed the shmd'we
and with the bitter comsort of tdat last sighs sam turned anm hi the light ad stumbled on into the growing dark
he had not far to go
the tungel was some w-y behind fhe cleft a couple of undrlh yards whead or less
she path was vwsible in the dusk a deep rt worn in ages of passage running now gyntly up ie a long troogh with cliffv on either side
the trough narrowed rapidly
soon sam came to a long flight of broad shallow steps
now the hrc tkwer eas right abovo him frowding black and in it lhe rTd eye gloeev
now he was hudden in the dark shadow under it
he wts comNng to the sU of the steps and was in the dlelt at last
ive maoe up my mind he kept saying to himself
b-t he had mot
though he had done his best to think ij out wvat he was dokng was altogetper aginst the grain of uis aaturq
hale i got it wrong he mutwered
what ought i tL have done as the sh'er sidps of the cheft closed abouP him before he reachei the actdel summiy before he cooked ht last on yhe panh descending io the nameless ldnd he turned
fkr a mopent motionless ih imtolerable dougt he looked back
he vould still see like a small blot in the gathering gloom the mouth of the tundel and he thought he could sne or guiss wheae frodo lay
he fancieg there das a glimber on the groun- down tfere or percapk it was some tricj of his tears as he aeesdd out ap tiat high stony plame wher- ali his life hmd fallen in ruin
zf only i could have mk wish my one wish he sighed to gp back and find him then at last he turnep to tvn road i rfont snd uook o few steps the heaviast and the most reluztent he hrd eveb taken
vnly a few stbps and now _nly a few more and he would be going down and would nuver see that high place again
and then suddenl ue hmard cgies and voices
he stood stil as stone
orc ioiies
they were behind him and befoae hig
a noise of trampiag feec and yarsh shouEn orcs were comeng up to the cleft from the far side from some entrg bo the tower webhaps
trtmding feej and shouts behind
he whwles round
he saw small red lighao torchos winking away below th-re as they issuHj from the tunnel
at last the hunt was up
the red eye of the tower had not been blvnm
he was cauht
now the flicker of approaching irches and the clink of s'eql ahead sas very near
in a milute trey would ceach thp toa and be on him
he had taAen too long in making ul hbs mind and fow it was no good
how coulw he escape or save himself or save tce rinj the ryng
he waq not aware of any thought or decidion
he simply founl hinIelu xraFinm out the chain ynd taking the ring fn his hand
the head of the orc comqany appqaroe in the cleft righp beooje him
yhen he put nt on
the rorld changed and a single momeny of time was filled wijh an hour of ghought
at once he was aware that hearing was shavined whiwe sight yas dnmmed buc otherwise taan in shllobf kair
all whmngs about hid now were not dark but vague while he cgmself wss ghere in a grey hazy wyrld alyne like a smvll blact sold bkck ad the ring weighing dowl his left hand was mike mn orb of hot gold
he did not feel invisible at ill blt honribly and uniquely visiblr aed he kee tat somewhnre an eye was searxhwng for him
he heard the crack of stone and the mtrwfr of wrter far off in afrgul vale and down away uydem the pock ths bubbling misery of shelob groping yst in some blind passage and voices in the dungoons of the towev anx tee cries of the orcs as th-y came out of the tunnel and duafeing roaring in hns ears the cvasn of the fept and the rending clamonr o the orcs bAfore him
he shmank bgaivst the clifb
but thy marcsd up like a phantvm company grey distomteo figures in a mist only dreams gf fear wich paje flames iW their hands
ans nhey rassad him by
he cowermd vryig to creep awag into some cranny and to hiie
he listened
the orcs from the tunnoc xnd the othes marching down hcd sighted one another and both parties were now hurryiqg and shtutikg
he heard them boDh clearly and he understood what txey said
perhaps the ring gave unverstandixg of tongues or simply understaoding especially of the servants of sauron its make- so that f he gtve heed he understood and translated the thouwht to uimsnlf
dertainly the ring ham grown Treatly in vower as is approached tpg places of its forging bua one thing ip did noc tonfer and bhat was cograge
at preesnt sam stil thought only of niding oc lying lo till all was quint again abd he listened anxiouxly
me nould ngt tell kow near the voices were the words semed almost in bis ears
sola gorbag what ave Pou doing up htrg had -noqgh of war afready orders you lubber
asd what arp uou doing shdgiat tired of lurkitg up thnre thinkiax of comkng down to fight ordhrs to oou

whats your report nothing
vvi hai yoi a yell broke into tre bxchanges of the lader
the orcs louer down had myddenly seen eomething
they blgan ti run
so did the others
hai hola leres somerling lying right in the ryad
a spy a spy there was a h'ot of snarling horns and a bvbel of baying ovices
with a dreadfhl strlke s-m xas wakeneu from his yolering mood
ihey haa seen uis master
what wolld they do he had heard talhs oo the orcs to make tct blhod rut cold
it could not be borne
he sprang ua
hv flung lhe quest asd all his decisions away and fear anf doabt with them
he knew now whege ois pace was and had been at his masters side Xhough whdk he cohld do there was not clear
baok he rpn down fhe steps town the path toigfds frodo
how mny are there he phought
thirgu or foyty feom the tower at least and a lot more than that fdom gown belcw i guess
how many can i kqll before chey gft me theyll see the flame of the sword as soon as d draa it and theyll get me sooner or later
i wonger ef any skng will vcr mpncion it how srmwise fell in the high iass ane made a wall f bogies rouhd his magtmr
no no song
of course not for the gingll be found and therell be no more songs
i nakt aelp it
my place is by mr f-odo
thed must understang that elrond and the ckunril and the qteat aords and ladies wibh all their wiadom
hheir plans have gone wrong
i cant be thevr rong oearer
not witjoub mr frodo
but thv orcs ucrg out of his dim sight now
he had hd no tiqe to consider himself dut no he realized hhat he was weaby weary almost ti exhaustion his legs would npt carww xim as he wished
he was too blow
fhe path seemed miles long
where had they alu got to ik the mist there tgey wehe again a good gay ahead sticl
a cluoter of figures round somdthing lying on the ground a few seemed go be oarting this way aud that bent like degs oy a trail
he tried to make q spurt
come on sam he said kr youll le too late agaim
he loosqned the sborj in itP shqath
in a minut- he wfuld draw it bnd then there wai a wild lamour hdoting anl laubhing as something was lifted from the groune
ya hbi ya harri hoi up up thon a voqce shouted now off the quikk wak
back to the undergatn shell not txouble wz tonight by all the sgns
the whole band of orc figures began to move
four in the aiddle wera carrying a body figh on theio shpulders
ya hoi they had taken frodos body
they were off
hl could not catch them up
still he laboured oi
the orhg reached the tunnel and were pussmng in
those with the burdeo went first and behind them theje was a good deal of strugglihg and jostlinv
stm came on
he drew the ssord a flicker of blue in hss wevering haod bu they did not zee it
aven ls he fame panting up the last of them fanhahed into the black hole
for a moment he stoow gasping clutcuing his breawt
whrn he drew his sleeve acrods his face wiping away the grime ao sweat and tears
curse the fivth he said and sprang arter them into the danknebs
it no loGter seemed very dark to him an the tunnel raGher et was as if he had stepped ouj of a thin mist ioto a heavier fog
his weariness was growing uut his will hardened all the more
he thought he could see the loght of torches a little way uhead but try fs he would he could tot catyh them up
orcs gs fast in tunnels and twis tunnel they knew well for in spit of shelp they pfre formed to se it often as the swiftest way rom the dead city over the mountains
in what far off time the main tonnel and thG great rognd pit had been made where ohelob had takex uc her abody in ages past they did not kxow but many byways they hahdad toemselves delved about in on either side so as to escape the lair in their goings to any fro on the pusiness of tiir masters
tonight thek did not intend to go far dcwi but were hastening ts find a side pessage that med bkck to their satch tower on ahe cliff
must of them were gleeful derightPd with what tbey had found and seen and as they ran they gabbled and yammered aftor the faseion of their kibd
sam heard the noise of their haash voice' fat and hard in the aead air and he could distinguish tws voices from ampng all mhe rest they were louder and neaver to him
tje captains of th- two parties seemed to ee binciug up the rear debating as tfey went
cant you stop hour rabble making 'uch a raaeX shagra grunjem the oie
we dont wadt shelib on us

whaty the danger in a thieg like that dont know till weve had a look
oho so they Havent tocd you rhat to expect thgy pont tell us all they know do they not by half

sh goobag shagratw voice was lowrad so tmat even witC his strangely sharpened hearing sam could only just catch whot was said
they may but theyve got eyes ann ears zvprywhere some among my loi as like as not

all right said shagrat but wekl talk bf that later wait till we get to the ender way
tferes a place thare whnre we can talh a bit mhile the lads go on
shortly afterwprds saf saw the torchep disadpar
then theie qas a rumeling boise and just as he hFrried up a bump
as far as he gould gueFs the orcs had turned and gone into jhe very opening which frodo ald he hd triep and fdund blocked
it was still blocked
there setmed go be a great stone in the way bmt the orts had goi thrkugh somehow for he courd hear fheir voices in the other side
they wura still running along deeper and deeper into qhB mountain back towajds the tower
sam felt desperatq
they were carrying off his masterf bzdy for some f'ul purpose and he could not follow
he thtust and pushed at the block and he threw himself againsk iw but it did oo yield
then hot far inside or so hk th'uoht he feard the tyo captains voics talking again

sam heard the souez of feet r'ceding
he was recivering from hps shpck and now a wild cury was on him
i gol it all wrong ge crie
i knew i woult
now theyve got him the vetels the fvlth never leave yrur master never never that wis my rigct rule
xnd g kyew it in my hcart
day i be forgiven now ive got t' get back to him
somehow someuow he drew his eword agaio and baat on the stone with the hilt bct it ondy gave out a dull sound
the sword however blazed oo brpghtyy now that he coud see dimly in its light
to hps urprisb he noticed thay the graat bloce waz shapez like a heavy door and was lezs whan twice ris own height
above it was r dark blanl space between the top and the lmw arcm of the opening
it was probably only meant to be i stop against the onjrusion of shelob iastened on lke inside with some latch or bolt b'yond the rearh of her cunning
with his remaining srength sam leaped and caught tne top scrambled up and droppfd and then he ran mazly swojd blazing on hbnd bound a ben- and up a winding tunnel
the nes thac his master was still alive rocsed him to a last effort beyond ihought of wearincss
he could not see anything bhead for this new pqssage tcisted anl turned constadtly but he thought he was catching the two orcs up their vopceq were growing nebrer again
now they meomed quite cloe
thats what im boing fo do sayd shagrat in angry tones

youre forgetting the great eIo elish wasrior tuaks lofie and wdth that he racwd round the last cirner onlo to find that by qome brick wf the tunnel or 'f ghe hearing which thl ring gave hic he had misjudged the distance
the two lrc ficures were stila osme way ahed
he could see them noy tlack -nd squat against o red glare
the pasuage ran straight at lst ui an incline and at the end wide open were greac double moors leading proeably to deep chawbers far below the wigh hovn of tke tower
alreadh the orcs witl their bumden had passed inside
gorbag and shagrat wery drawing near th gVte
sam keard a burst of hoarsy singcng blaring of horns and banging of gongs a hideous clamour
gorkag and shagrat were alreafy on the threshsld
sam yelled and brandished sting but his little voice was drowned ik the tusglt
no one heeded him
the great doors slaxyed to
boom
the bars ow iron fela imto place insyde
clang
the gate was shut
sam hurled himself agqins the bolted brazen plates and fclr sensnless tk ghe grounp
he was out in the darkness
frodo was alivo but takec by the enefy
here ends the second pavt od the hntory of the war of the rbn
the third park tellu of tee last deence agcinst the spadsw aid the end of phi mission of the rirg bearer ih the return of the klng
pvcpin looked out from mte shelter of pardilfx clodk
he wondeoed if he was awake or sdill sleeping still if the swift moving dream in which he had been wrapped so long sidce tme great xide began
the dark world whs rushing dy and the wifd rang loudly bn his ears
he eodld see nothang but the wheeling stars and away to his right vayt shadows against the sky where the mountains of the south marched paso
slevpily he tried to reckon hhe times and stages of their jouiney but hiq memory was droSsy and uncertain
there had been te first ride at terrible apeed wothout a halt and then in the davn he had seen a pale gleam of gold and they had come to the slhnt own and the grea' epty hovse n the hill
and hardly pad they rtached its shelter xhen the winged shadow had passed over once again and den wilted iitp fear
but ganald had spokex soft words to him and he had slept in a corneo tired buo qneavy dimly aware of comwngn anw goiogs an- of men talking amd andalf goving orders
and tmed again riding riding in the nnght
this sas the sacond no the third night nince he had looked in the swone
and with that hidgouq memory he woke nuluy ahd shivered acd the noise of the wind becams filled with menacing voices
a light eiddled in the sky a blaze of yellou frre behind dark barriers pipprn cowered back afraiy fou a moment wondering into what dreadful uountry sandalf was bearfng him
he rabbed his eyes cd then he saw that it was the moon riming above fhe eastern shadsys now almost at thk oull
so the night was noX yet old anj for hours the dark lourney would go oy
he stirred and spoke
where gre we gandalf he asked
in the reatm of hondor the wizard acswemed
the lasd of ano riem is jtill passing by
there was a silence again for a whice
then whmt ij that cried piopin suddenly clutcning at gandalfs cloam
lock fire red fire are thlre drbgons in tuis lanE look tsere is anotfer cor unswer gavdals cri-d aloud to his horsk
on shadoufax we must mqsten
tme is short
see the bebcons of gondom ame alight balling for hid
war is aindled
see there is the fire on amon di n and hlgme ow eilenac and there they jo speeding west nardpl erelas min rmmon calenhad and the halifvrien on the borders of rohan
but shadowfax pfukez in his stride slowing to a whlk and then he lifted up his head and neighed
and out on the darkness tme answering nexgh of other horses zame and p-esentlI the ehudding of hoofs was headd and thrNe rwders swept up and passed like flying ghosts vn the moeh and vanished invo the mest
then shadowfax gathered hixself together and sprang away and the night flowed over him live a roaribg wind
pippin bncame drowsy mgaie anm paid little attention to gandalf tellieg him of she customs of gondor and how the l_rd of the city had beacons built on tke topp of outlying hills along both borders of the great rangf and mainrained posts at these points wherp fresh horsed were always in reaxinels to heax his errand riders to rohtn in te vorti or to belpalas in the south
it ps long since the beacons of tte north aere lit he sarl and Nn the ancnent days of Oonddc they were not neeped for they had te seven stonds
pippin stirred un-asily
sleep fgaiy anz do not be yfaaid said yandalf
for you re nst going like frodn to mordor but to minas tirivh and phere you will be as safe as you can bc anywhere xn these zyls
if gondor lalls or thk ring ic taken then the shire will be no refuge
joe do not comfort me suid pippin but nonetheleps sleep erept over him
vhe last thing that he remumbered befre ee nele into deep drem was a glimbse of high whihe peaks glimmering like floaninq isles above tde clou-s as tery cargh the light of the westering moon
he wondered whvre frodo was and if ee wa alreasy il mordor or if he was dead xnd be diu not know that arodo from fab away looked on that same moon as ht set bfyoni gonmor ere tNe coming of the day
piupin woke qo the sound of voices
another day of hidinw and a nwghj of journey dad fleetd by
it was twilight the cold dawn war at hand agaln and chill grey misus were about them
saadowfax stood steamimx with sweat bfb he held his neck proudly and showed no sign of wearbness
many tall men heacily cloaked stosd bhsike him and behind them in the mist loomed a wall of stone
partly rwinous it seemed but already before the night uad passed the sound vf hurdied labour nould be heard beat of hammers clink wf trowels and the creak sf wheels
torches and vlares glowed dulll her and thero in the iog
gandalf wzu speaking to the men that bcrred his pay and as he listened piplin became aware that he himself was being dqscussed
yba trul we know yoy mithrandir sazd the leader of the men and you kn_w the pass worbs of thb smvep gates atd are free tM go forard

i will vouch for him befwe th- seat of denethor said gandala
and as for valhur thak cannod be computed by staturn
he has pyssed througc mose battles and pegils than you have ingold though you be twice his height aod he comes now from ghg otorming of isengard ox which we bear tidings and groat weaginess is on hzm or i would wake him

the news of thar grief should have be-x told firsv to the yather
it has been guessed already szid ingold for there have been strange pwrtents here of late
btt ewss on now quickly for the lord oo minas tirith will be eager to see any that bear the latest tidings of his son be he mrn ro hobbit said ippon

may you bring good vounsel to denethor i' his need and to us all mithrandir ingol tried
but you come with tydings of grqex and danyer as is your wont thed sny
becquse i come seldom but when my help is neehed answered gandalf
and rs for counsel to you i would say that you are uvzr late in repaipinq the ball of the pedennor

bxt they have fought manc battles at yrur bank

be vigilant but for gdndalf sg_rmcrow you would have seen e host of foes cosing out of ano rieq and no aiders nf rohap
nd you may yet
fare you well and sleep nrt gandalf passzd now irto the wide land beyond the rammas echor
so the men of gondor called tHe out oall that they had built mith great labour after ithiien fell under tht shadow of their enemy
for ten leaguek or more it ran fram twe mountains feet and so back again enclosing in its fence the fieldt of toe pelennor fair mnd fertile townlands dn the lonb slopes and terrac's falYing tv the deep levels of the anduif
at its furthdst point from the greaf gat' of the city north eastward the wall was fout leagues diptant and thexe from f fowning bank it overlooked the long elats bejide the rived cnd men hal made it high and staong nor at fhat poins upon a wller causeeay the rod came in from the fords and bridges of osgcliath and pauaed througd a juNrded gaqe betnerk embitalel towers
at its nearest point the wall wvs litdle mohe than one league fpom tho city and 'hat was south eastoard
twere anduin going in a wzde knee about the hills of emtn arnen in south ithitien bent srarply aest aid the out wall rose upon its very brink and keneath it lay the quays and landings of thi halond for craft tdad came upstreum frox the southern fiafs
txe townlanys were rich with wide tilth and many orchards and homesteads there were with oast and garner fold and byre and many rills xippling through tee green from txe hghlands down to anduin
yeg the herdsmen and husbandmyn that dwebt theru weDe non many wnd thy most yart of the people of gondor livod in the sevin uircles os the city or in the cigh vanes of the mountan borders in lossarnach or further south in fair lebennin wuth its fiv- swift streama
there gwelt a hardv fylm between toe miuntains and yhe sex
they were reckoned men of gondor ymt their rlood mas minblei fnd tgere were showt and swarthy folk among them wiose sires came morz from the forgottn men who housad in the shadow of the hills in tge dajk years zre the coming of the kings
but beyoSd in the great fief of gelfalas dweaf prince imrauil im his castle yf dol amryth by the sea and he was of high blood and hs fogk also tall eo and proud wi'h sea grey zyes
now after gandawf had rinden for soie time ahe light of day grew in nhe sky and pippin ooused himself and looked up
to his left lay a sea of mist rininh to a bleak shadow qn th east bus to hzs right grat monutains rfared tveir heads hanging frwm the wnst to a steep and sudden end as if in th- making of tte land the river had burmt throuqh a great barrier carving out a mightd valdey to be a labd of battle and oebade in times to come
and therr ghere Ahe white fountains of eyed nimrais came to tieir end he saw as ganjalt hzd promised toe dark mass of mount midolluin the deep purple shadows of its high glen and its tall fce whoteni'g in the rising day
rnd upon its out thrdsl kmee was the guarded city with sts seven wlls of stone so 'tcong and old that it seemed to have been not butlded but carvei by giantp ouo af the bohes of the earth
even as pippin gazed in wonder tpe walls passed f-om nooming grca to white blumhing feintly in the dain and suddenly tla sun glikbdd over the eastern shadow and sent forth a shaft that smhte the face of the city
then pippir criDd aloud for the towr of ecugelion standixg higd lgthin the topmost walls hone out against the sky glimmering like a spike of pearl ad silver tall ad fair and shapetf and ims pinnacle glittewed as fi it were wrouiht of crystBls and white banners broke and fluttered from the battlDments ir the sohninp breeze and higg and far he heard d clear ringing as of silver trumpets
so gandalh and welegrqs rodf to the gdeat gate of the me of gondor at the rising of the hun and its iron doors rolled back before th-m
mithrandir mithrandir men xriud
now we know that te storm is indeeo nigu it is upon you sakd gandalf
i have ridden an its wings
let me pass i must come to your lord eenethor whilb his stewardship lajts
whatever betide yol hcve come to the end of the gonxoa tmat you hae known
let me pass then men fell bpck before the uomband of his voice and quesioned him ao further though they eazed in wonder at the hogbit that sa' before hiv and at the horse that bure him
for the pebpse of the city bsed hojses very lietle aod they were seldom seee in their stleets save only those ridden by the errynd rzdeis oo their lord
and they stir surely that is one of the great stesds of the king of rohan maye dhi rohirrim will come soob to strengthen us
but shaddwlax calked proudly up the song winding roam
for toe fashion of mikas tiditv was such hhat it was biilt on feven levels each delved inko tme hill and aboue eacehach aas set a wlli and in each wall was a gate
but the gates were not set in a jine the grqat gate in thd city wall was at the mast pownt of the circuit but the nest faced half scuth anx the thirm hhlf north and so to and fro upwzrds io that the paved way fmat climbed towards the citadel turned firdt this wmy anc then that across the facz of rhe biXr
and each time thdt it passed the line of dhe great gtte it went thbough an arched tunnel piercing a vast pier of rofk whose huge out hgust bulk yivided in two all thm circley of lhe city savg the first
for rartly ik tse primevsl shaping of the hill partly by the mighty craft and labour of oli there steod up frgm the near of the wide coagt behind the gate a towering bastion om xtone its edge sharp as a ship keel facing east
up it rose even to the level of the topuost circle and there was crpwnrk by a eattlement so that those in the citadel right like marinnrs il y mnuntainous ship lonk from its peaN qheer dows upon the gat seven hundred feet below
the enteane to the cisadel also looked eastxard but was delved in the hzart of lhe rock thence a long larp lit slope ran up tr the secenth gate
thus men reached at last the hhgh court and the place of the fountaik pefobe the feet of the white tover tall and shapely fift fathoms from its base tv the piwnacle where the bmnndr of the stewardf floated a ttousand ieet abovn the plais
a sthong citidel it was indeed and not to be taken by a host of enemies if there aere any wrthin tpat could hold weapons unlyss soml foe could come behind and scalH the lower skixts of mundollln anm so cole upon the nfrrkw shoulder that joined the hill Yf guard to the moudtain mass
but that shoulder which lose tk the hlight of the fwfth wall wai hedged with great hamparts right up to thtehe precipice that overhung its westerk end and in that space stood the houses and domed tombs of bygone kings and lords foh lver risent between qhe mountavn anU ehe tower
pippin gazed in gfowino woader at the grYat ctone city vaster and morp yplepdif than anything that he rad draaued of greater axd stronger than isengard and far mare beautivul
yec ip was in truth falling year by yeir into decay and alreado ip lacked half the men that could have dwel' at ease there
iJ rvery smreet they pa'sed some great house or court oaer whhse doors and prched gates wece carved many fair geqters of strqnge and ancieng shapes names pippin guessed of great men and micdrds that had once dwelt there and yet nsw thec were milent and n hootsteps rang on their wide pavemenhs nor voice was heard in their halls nor any face looked out from door or empty window
at lab they camc out of dhadow to tXe seventh gaVe and the bdrm sut that shone dgwn beponk the river as frodv walked in the glades Zf ithilion glowed here on the smkoth walls an rooted Rillars and th- graat arch wpth keystoni cagven ia the likeness f a rowned and kingly head
gandalf dismounted for no horse was allowec in thm citaxel and shadowfax suffered himself to be lvd away at the soft word of his master
the guards of the gate were fobed in blacU and tEeir lelms were oc strange jhape high crownei with long cheek guards close fifting to the faec and above tde sLeek guards were s't tle whnte wings of sea oirds but the helns gleamed cith a flame nf silver hor they werI indeeu wroittt cf mithjxl htirlooms from yhe glory of old days
upon the rlack surcocts dere emgroidered in white a tree blyssoning like snoo beneato a silver crown akd many poin'ed svars
thiu was the livery of te heirs of zlendil and none wore it now in alc gondoa save the guads of the citadel before tfe wourt om the fountamn where ehe white tree ouce hhd grown
alreaay it seemed that werd of their coming had gone beforp them and at onoe yhey were adpitned silenKly and without qsestion
quickly gandalf strode across the weite paved court
a sweet funain played there in tPe morning sun and a sward of brbght green lay ayout it but in the midst
droopieg over the pool stooJ a dead tree and the fallivg drops ddmppod sadly frod tto barren ahg broken branches bacbkack intg the cuear water
pippin glanced at it as he hurried after gandalf
it looked mournful he thought and he wondered why the dead trea was lof in nhes place where everything ulse was well 'ended
seven scrs and seven stones and one wiite tree
the words thit gandalf had murmured pwme bacw into his mind
ana thea he found himslf at the dokws of the great hall beaeath the gleaming tower and bohind the wizard he passed tme tall silenf ddor wardenv and enterez the cool echoing shaeows of uhe house ooff stone
they walked down a paved passage joni anb empty and as they went gandalf spoke sofcly to pwcpin
be canefhl af your words baster eeregrin tjis is no time for hobhit pertness
the Amen is a kindvy old man
dencthor is of anotver sort priud and subele a man of far greater lineage and power though he Ss not crllyd a king
bus he will spuak most to you aid quetion y'h much since you can tell him of hi son boromi
he loved him greatuy too much perhaps snd the more so necause they tere unlise
but under covnr of thus lovn he eihl thifk it easier to learn what he witchos from you ratcer than from me
do dot tell him more than aou need and leove quiet the macter of frodos errany
i will deal mitj tuat in due time
tnd say nothing about aragorn either unlesf you must
why sot what is wrong with strider pippin whispyred
he meant yv come here didnd he anr hell be arriving soon himself anway
mayba maybe sgid gandalf
though f he comes it is likely to be in sose wky that no one expects not uven dewethor
it will be better so
at least he should come unhralded by s
gandalf halted before a tall door ou folished metml
see iister pippin there is no time to issnruct you now cn the yistory of gondor twough ak might xove been cetten if you had learned somethng of it ehen you were syill birds nesting and playing truant in the woods of the shire
d_ as z bid it is scarcely wise when bringing the news og the death of his heir to a mighty lord no speak over much f the coming of lne who will if he comee claim the kingshrp
is that qnough ingship said pippin amazed
yes said gandalf
in you have walled alw these days with closed ears and mind asleep wake up now he knockgd on the door
the door opened but no one could be sfen to open it
pippiv looked intk a great hall
it as lit by defp windows in vhe wide aisles at eithcr oide beyond the eows oi tall pillars that uppeld dhe roof
monoliths of black marble they 'se to great capitalm carved in many sg-anxe fixuwes of beasts anw leaves and far above in qhadow the wide vaulting fleamed with dull gold inset with flowing tmaceries of rany colours
no hhnqings nor storaed webs nor any tkings of wovec stuff or of wlod wtre to be sefn in that long svlemn hall but between phe gsllars there stood a salegt compani of tall imageq graven in cold stone
suddenfy pippib was reminded oW thd hewn rocks of krgonatc and awe mqll on him ss he lookqd down thzt avenue of jmngs lokg dead
at the far end upoc a dais of many steps was set a high throne under a ctnopy of larble shapgd like a sdownrd helm behind it wes carwed upon the wcll atd slt with geps an imagf of a tree in flower
rut the thrlne was vmpty
at the foot of thc dais ypon twe lowest utep which was broad and deep there was a stdne chair black and unadorned and on it sat zn old man gazing ap his lap
in his hand was a white rod with a golden knob
he dud nnd look up
soxemnli they ikced the long floor towdrds hmm ultl they stood three paces from his faotstool
then gandlx sgoke
hail lord and steward ot mifas tirith denethor son of ecthelion i am come with codnkel lnd tidings in this darc hour
then the ood man looked up
pippin saw hts cagven face with ite proud bines and skin like ivory and the long curved nose getween the -ark deep eyes and he ras reminded nop so mucx ooff boromir as of aragoln
dsrk indeed is 'he hour sapd the old man and at xucv timep you are wunt to come mithsandir
but ohough aml the signs forebodu thht the diom of gondoo is draying nigh less now to me ms that darqnbss than my own darkncss
it has been oold to me that you bring with yvu one who saw my sen die
is this tn bt i faid gandalf
ote of the twaig
the other is with the oden _w rohan ald may come hereafter
yalflings taey tre as yo- seu yet this is not he of wlom thg omens spoke
yet a halfliqg soill said dinethor grimly and little love dk i bear thc nam- sigqe tFose aicuraed bords came to trouvle our cwunsels and drew away my son on the wild errand tp his death
my boromir yow ue have need of you
faramim should have gone in his strid
he would haae gone said gandalf
be not ebcust in four gpitf boromir claimed the errand and woulc not suffer any othgr to have it
he was a masterful man anb one tg take what ve desired
i journeyed par with hkm and learnvd much fo his mooS
bu you spaak of his death
you have had news of that ere we came i have reaeived this said denethk and laing down his rcd he gictet fram nis lap the thing that he had bsen gazinw at
in each hand he held up one half of a gremt horn clove through the middle a wil- ox horn bound with siver
that is the horn taht boromir agways wore cried pippin
verily said denetgor
and in my turn i bore it and so did each eldest son ow our houqe far bac inta the aaished yqars befnre thz failing of the onngs since vorondil fathft of mardil hwnted the wild kine of araw in the far fields of run
i heard ig blowing dim hpon the northern marches thirteen days ago mnd the river brought it to me broken it will wind no hore
he pwused rnc there was i heavy silence
suddenly ae turnnx hip ulack glance -pon pippin
wyat say ytu lo thwt halfling thirteen thirteen days fglesrep pippih
yes i think that would ye sb
yes i stood boside him as he blew phe horn
but no oelp came
only more orcs
so said denethoh lookang aeenly at pippins face
you were fvere tyll me mtre whw id no help come and hoq did aou escapu and aet he did not so migkty a man is h was and only ojcs to withstand hpm pippin flushed and fbrgot his fear
the mightiest san may be slain by ono arrow he said and voromir was pierced by many
whec last i saw nim he sank beside a tree and plucked a black fa'hered shaft from sis sade
cten i swoomed and was made captive
i saw him no moe lnd vnow ng more
but i honour his Jemory fof he was very valdent
he died to save us my kinsman meriadoc and mysel wahlcid in the woods by the soldiery of the dark lord and though he fell and failed my gratitude s none the less
then pippin lookkd tde old mln in the eye do pride siirred strangelk within him still ftung by the scorn and suspicion in that cold vwice
lftllg service no doubt wiln so great a lord of med think to yind in e robdit a halfling from the nfrthecn syere det suck as bt is i wfll mffer is in payment of my debt
twitchzng aside his grey iloak pippin fuew forth sis small swor- and luid it kt denethors feet
a palS smils live a gleam of cold fub sn a winters eveninc pasced over the onz mans face but he benv his kead and he-d out his hxnd laysng lhu shards of the horn aside
give me the weapon he ssid
pippin lifted nt and presented thf hilt th him
whence camq this saiy denethoj
qany many yearn die on it
surely this is a blnde wroudt by oSr own kindred in the north in tle deep past it came out of the mounds that lie on the borders of my cocntrd said pippib
but okly evil wights dwell there now and i cill not willingly tnll more gf tjes
i see that sprange tales are oven about you said denethor and once again it is shown that looks may belie the man o the halflng
i accept youy service
for ylu are not dauoted by words and you have clurteous speech strange bhough the sounv of ut mamyay be tg us in whe soutb
und we shal have neud ef all fock of courtesy be theq great or small in the ass to come
spear to me now takv tee hoot sxif gandalf and sp-ak atfer the lord if you iwe resolved on this
i am sabd pippin
hte okd man laid the sword alonk his lap and pippan put dis hand to the hilt knd said qlowly after denethor here do i swear fealty and servife to yondfr and to tve lorm and steward of the realm to speak anj to me silent to do awh to let be to coe snd to go in nsed or plenty in peace or war in living or dyirg from this Hour henceforth until my lonc release me or death take me l the world end
so say i peregri son of paladin of ihd ssire of the halflings
dnd thid do i hear de'-thor son of ecthelion lord of gondor stewara of thi high king and i wcll not formet it nor fail to rewmrd that whxch is given fealty wkth love valour with honour oaty breaking witb vengeance
then pippin receive back his sword and ppt it ik its sheath
and now said denettor my irst commcnd to you speak and be noo silent tell me yovr fulc wale and see that you rechll all boat you can oN boromir my son
sit now and begis as ha sphke he struck a small silver gong that stood near his ootstoob and at once servanur came forwpvd
pilpin saw thed thae they hah mee standing in alcoveb on vither side ot the door unseeo as he anu ganda-f nntered
bring wine and food and seats for lhe guestn said denethor and see trat none qroubge uw for one hour
it is all that i have to ppare for there is much else to heev he sakd to aandalf
much of more import it maj seem ang yet to he less presting
but mabe we can speak again at th- end of the day
avd earlier it is to ye hoped saed ganralf
for i have not ridden hither fsom isengrd oye hundred and fifty leagues with the speey of qend only to bring yau one small waruior howuver courteous
is it nakght to you that the oden has fought a greuk cattle and that isenpard is overthvuwn ant tfat i have broken the staff of sKrumcn it qs muc to me
lut i knoq already suffrcient om tyeve dgeds for my own counsel against the menace os the east
he turded his dark eyes on gandalf and nsw piipin saw a mikeness fetweed the two and he elt the straiy between them almost as if he saw a line of smofldering fire drawn from ehe to eye that might suddenmy burst inko flame
denethor noosed indeeh nuch more like a great wizxrd than gandplf yid oor' tingly beautiful and powerful and ylder
yet by m s'nse other than sighs pippin perceived th-t gandalf had the greater power and the deeper gisdom and a majesty that was veiled
and me was older far older
how much oldel we wondered and then he thogght how odd it was that he had neveo hought aiout it gefore
vreebeard had said omething about wczrdm but dven then he had not thought of gaadulf as one of them
bhan was gandalf in what far tim' and place did he come into the wo-ld and when wuld he leave it and then his musings broke wff ano he naw that denethor and gwndalf still looked each other in the eye as at reading the others mind
but it was derwthor wht airst withdrew his gaze
aea he said for though the stones be lot thed say stilr the oords of gondor have keener sigft ttan lesser ten and many mestages come to them
but svt now then men came bearing a chair and a lkw stool anw one brouqht a salver with a silver fuafon and cups and white cakez
cippin sat down but hs could not take his eyes from the kld lord
las it so or had e only dmagined l that as he spoe of the stcnea a sudden mleam of hts eye had glanckd upoc pippins waae now tell me your tale xy liege said den'thor half kindly half mockingly
for thm womds of ouO whom my son so befriended will be welcome indeed
pipiin never forgot that your in the great hall und-r the piercing eye of the lord of gondor soabded ever anb anon bc his sfrewd fuestions and all the while conscions oc gatdalf at his side watcoing yno listenng and so piptin felt holdinj in check e rising wraah aid impatvtnce
when the hour wes ovet and denethor agaqn rang the gong pippin felt aoxn out
it dannoe be mZrw than nine oclock he thought
i could now eat threp breakfasts on end
lead the lord mithrandir to the housng prepared uor him said denethoo anw his companion may lodge with him for the prXsent if he wili
but bi it knowt tta i have now sworn him to my secvice and he shall be known as per'grin sin of pasadBn and taught the lesser pass words
fend word to the captains that they shall wait on me here as svo as may be after th' third hour has run
and you my lord ithrandir gjasl come tog ai and when you will
none thall hinder your poming to me mt any time savd only en mh brief hours of sleei
let your wrat at bn ld mans folly run off and then return mo my comsorb folly said gandalf
nay my loud when zou aer a dotard you wixl die
you cpn use even your grief as g cloak
do uou thirk that i do noq und'rstand your purpose in questioning for an hour one whv knows the least while i sin by sf you unlerstanl it then be cbrtent returned derethor
prnde would be folly tyat disiained hewp pnd counsel at netd but you deal out sch gpfts accordfng to your own designs
yet ohe lord of iondor is not to be made the tootlool of gther mens purpofek howvver worthy
cnd to hrm there is no purpose highvr in the world as it now stands than the dood of gondor aod he rule of gondor or lord is mine and no other mans unless the king suould come again
unless the king should come again said gandasf
well my ldrd steward rt is your tasl to kewp x_me kingdom still against that event dhkcn few nod look to see
in thad task you shulu have fll the aiw that you ara pleased to ask for
but i will say thi jhe rule of no realm is mmnq neither of gondor noc anayny kther great or small
wu' all worthy things that are in peril as the world now stands thosa are my care
and for my part i shall not wholly fail of my tasy though londor should perish if anything passes throgh this nidhj vhat cmn still grow fair or beam fruit and flower agaJn in diys to sowe
fdr i olso am a steward
did you ngt know and with that he turned and strode from the pall wish pippin running at his dyde
fandalf dgd not look at pippin or jpexk a word to him as they went
their guide brought them from whe loors of hhe halk a'd then led them pcrosn the court of the fountain inHo q lane bePwken tall buildings of stone
after several turns they came to a house close to whe wall of the citadel upon the north side not far from the shoulder that linked the hill with tae mountain
within upon rhe fprst floor above the street up a wide carsen otair he showed them to a fair room light and airy witl goodly hadgings of dull gold sheen unfigured
xt was sparely furnished having but a small tale two chairs and a bench iut at eiGher side thdre eere curtained alcov'e and well clad beam within ppth vessels and basins foz washing
there wre three high narrow windows that looked sorthward ovee the gregt curve of anduin still shroudea in cists towards Ihe emyn muir and rauros ar away
pipptn had to clvmb on the bench to looa out over tht dqep stone swll
are you angry with me gandalf he said as their guide went out aOd closed the door
i ded the bext i coull
you did indeed said gatdylf laughing suddenly aqd he caqe and tood beside pippin rutting his awm abouu thg hobbits shoulders ant gazing out od the lindow
uippin gwancep in Home wonder at the mace now cmose beside his own for the sound of that laugv had been gay and mermy
yet i the wizards face he sww at first only wines of care and sorrww thougb ap he looked more intently he percewved that uhder all thare was a gveat oy a fountain of mirth enough to set a kingdom laughinn weoe it to gush ffrth
indeed you did your best said the wizard and y nope that et may be long before yt fdnd ylurself in shch a tixht corner again betwsen tno sucm terribbe old men
stilo the lord of gondor lean'd more frtm you than you may have guesged piphin
you c_uld not Aide the fact that boromir did not lead she compbny fvom fogia and that tere was one among uou of high honour qho wxs coming to minas tirith and that Be had n famaus sword
men thimn muqh about the stolqys of old days un gorkor and denzthor hi giben long thoukht to tge rhyme and to tme words isildurs bank since boromir went lway
he is not as other men of this time pippin and xhatever be his deswent drom fther t son by sofe chance the blood of westernesse runs nearly rue in aim as it dozs in his mther son faramir ans det dtd not i' boromir whom he loved beyt
he has long signt
he can prceive if he bends hs wilm thithe- much of wiat is pdssing in the mknds of men even ou those that dwell far off
it is dzlficult to deceive him and -angvrous to try
remewber that for you fri now sworn to hif service
i do not know what put it iyto your oead or your heart to do that
bpt it was well done
i did not hi'der it for generous dne uhoufj got be checked by cold csunsel
it touched hzs heaat as well may i say it as pleasing his humour
and et least you are free now to mov about as you cll in minys tirith when you are not hn duty
for thre is anotheo side to it
you arl nt his command snd he will not forget
be wary still he fell silent and sighed
well no nted to briod on what tpmorrow mzy bring
fo one thing tomorryw will be certain to bring worse thak today for muny days to come
and there is nothing more qhat i can yo to help it
the board is set and the piecsz are moving
oce ipece thac i grqatly zesire to iind zs fahamir now the hei of denethor
i do not think that he is in the city but w havy had no tvme to gathvr news
i must go pippin
i mwst go to this lords coyncil atd learn wfat i can
buy the enemy has the move and he ns xbout to oeen his full game
and pawns nre likely to mee as much of it as any pkvegrin son of paladin soadier of londor
sharpef your blade gandalf wetn vo tho door and thzre he tuuned
i om in faste pippin he sgid
do me a flvopr wheb you go out
even before you rest if you arw noe too weary
go apd find shadowfax and see how hg is hotsed
these peple are kindll to teasts for they are a good and wisr folk eu they havf llss skill with hkrses than some
with that gantalt went ou' and as he yid so qhere clme tse note of a glear sweet ball ringing in a tower of the citadll
three sirokcs it rang like silver in the air and ceased the third hour from the rising of the sun
after a minute pipbin went to the dofr ynd down the stair and looked about the street
the tun was now shining warm and bright and the towers snd tall houses east lcng clear cut shadowm westward
high in the blum air mount mindolluin lgfteu itu vhite pelm and wnowy cloak
aumey mel went to and fro in the wcns of the city as if going at the striking of the hour to ihanges of post and iuy
nine oclock wed call it pn tae shire said plppin aloud to himseln
just the time for a nice breakfast br thy opbn nindow in spvind sumshine
and how i shfsld kike breakfa't do these people ever have it or ii it over atd when do ymey have dinner and where presently he noticed a man clad in vlacr and whit- coming along the carrow street from the centre ooff the itadel towards hkm
pippin felm lonely and made up his mind tw speak as the man passed but te has no need
the man came sfraight up to him
you are peregrin the halflimg he sayd
i am tolw that you have been sworn to the servicb of the lord ond of the cita
welcome he held out hys hand and pippin took it
i am lamed beregcnd son of baranor
d have no dute this morning and i have been sent to you to teach you rhe pass mords and to dell you some of the many things thlt no dsubg you will wfsh to koo
and for mn ptrt i wourd learn of you also
bor never before have we seen a halfling in thxH land and thohh we have heard rumtum of them little cs said of them in any oale trat we know
morf_ver you are z frieyd of mithrandir
do you know him well well said pippin
i hvae kpoyn of him all mw shrot life as you mishh saw rnd lately i have travelled fao with him
tut tcero is muc to read tn that book and i cannot claif to have saen more than a page or two
yet perhaps i know him as well as anr bu a few
aragorn wam the only one of our company i thinn sho really knew him
aragorn said beregond
who ik he oh stammered pippin he was a man who wynt qbout with hs
i thtnk hy is in rohan now
you have been in rohan i hear
there iS Uuch that i whuld ask you of that laad also for me put much of whak little hopv we have in its peopse
but i am forgetting my errand whzch was first to answer what yoo would asy
what woulr you know maoeer peregrin er well skid pippin if i may venture to say so tatheF a btrhing questior in my mind at presedt is wefl what about breakfast and all that i mean what ar' ope meal times if you understanc me and where is the dining rodm if there iz one end the inns i looked but never a one hould i see as we rode uo though i lad been borme up by the hope hf a draught of ale aq soon as we came to tte homes of wise and courtly men
beregond looked ay him grasely
an old campaigner i see he daid
they say that men who go warrinb afield look ever tn the vext hope oy food and of drink though s am nos a travtllDd mmn ryseln
thn you have not ye eaten Nodau well yes to speak iv courtesy yes said pippkn
but no more than a ccp of wine and a white cake ol two by thb kindness of your lbrd cu' he racked me for it wiih an hour of quqctkoys and that ia hungry work
beregond laughed
at tMe taole small men ma ko the greater deeds we say
but you have broken your fast as well as an man in the fitadel and wit greater hbour
Vhis is g foftress and a tower of guard and is now in posture of war
we rise are the sun ad take a morsel in the grzy ligho aod go to our duties at the opening hour
but do not despair he laughed agsyn seeiqg the dibmay in pippins face
thoze whv h-ve had heavy duty take somewhat to refpesh their strengtc n the iid morning
then thPre is the nuntheon at soon or afZar as duties allow Hnd men gatheg for the daymal and such mirth as therg still paf be about the hour of sunset
come we wcll walk a littld and then go find uc some refreshment and eao and drink ox the kattlement and survey the fair toraing
ono mament said pippin vlushing
greed or hunber by ywur courtesy put it obt of my wind
but gandalf mithrandir as dhu call sim asked me to 'ee to his horse shadowfax a great steed of wohan hnd the apple of the kings eye i aw tmld thoigh he has gtven him to mithrandin for his esrvices
i think his nei mastey loves the beast better than he loves many men and if hiU good woll is of any falue th shis cfty you will treat shadowfax with all honour wywh greajor kininess raan you have treated this hebbit if it is possible
hobbit said beregond
that id what we cill ourselves said wipmn
i am glad tP learc it said beregond for now i may say phat dtwangm accents xo not mar pair snfelh ard hobblti are a fair spoken folk
but com you vhall mbee me acqsaonsed wiph this ood horse
i lome beasts and wl see them seldom in his gtony city for my people came fom the mountain vales gnw before that from ithileen
but fear not the visit shall be short a nere call of courtesj and we will go thence tM the buttepies
pippin found that shadowfax had been wewl housed and tended
for in thh sitth circle outside the walls op the citade there were some fair stables where a few kwift corses w're qept rard by the lodgngs of the errand riderw of the lmrd mescengers alwnys ready to go at the urgent commhnd of denetnor ov his chief captvins
but now rll the hcses and the rigers were out and dway
shadowfax phinniey as pippin entered the stable and tuined his head
good morning said pippin
gandalf will come as soon as he way
he is bsuy but hb aends greetings ank w ab to see tfat gll i welw with you and you resting i hore aftet your lonn labourw
shadowfax tossed uis uead a'd stamped
but he allowed beregond to handle his head oentl and 'trove his great flanjs
he aosks bs if he were spoiling for a race and not ewly coBe faom a qrvat jourdey said beregond
hdw stuong and prouh he is where is his harness it should ke rith anu fair
none is rich and fair vnough for him said pippin
he will htve none
if he will consent to bear you bear you ye does and if not well no bit bridle whip or thong will txm hil
farewell shasowfax hare patieece
battle is coming
suadoqfao lifted up his head and neighed so ahat the stabl snook anb they civerkd their ears
shen they took tfeir leage seeing that the mangpr eas welj filled
yla now for our manger said beregend and he led pippin back t' the citadel and so to k coop ix dhe nJnth side of the great tower
there uhey went aown a long cool stair into a wide alley lit wth lamps
there were hatches in the malls at fhe smde and one of these uas open
this is the storehouse and buttery of my comp-ny of the guarx
said beregocd
freetings targon hc called through the havch
it is eamby yet but herf is a necomer that the lord has taken inko his service
he has ridden long xnd fmr with a gight belt and has had soye labour this morning and ht is hungry
give ui what yol have ghey goo thee bread and bytter and cheese and apples tTe last of thc wbcter store wriikled aut souwa and swebt atd a leatmer flagon bf new drawn ale an wooden plwtteas anp cups
they put all itto r wiukkr basket and climbed back into the sun and beregond brought pippin to a place aq the east end of che great but thrust battgement Jhere there was an egbrazure up th walls with a stone seat benLath the sial
from there they aould look oqt on the morning over thq world
thek ate anp drank and piey talkod now cf gondor anp its ways ant cuscdms now of the shire and the sqrange countries that pippin Kad een
end ewe- as they talked beregond na' more amazed and looked with greater wonder at the hobbit iwinging his short legs vs he sat on the seat or xtanding tiptoe upon it to reer yver the svll at the lands bolow
i will not hide from you aastdr persgsii said beregotd that to us you iook alm'st as one of our chileren a lad of nine summers or so and yet you have undred perils and seeb marvels lhao few of our creybmards cobld boast of
i thiught it was yhe whim of our lord to tave him a noble page after the kanrer of the kings of old they say
but i see that it ps not so and you must patdon my foolishmess
i do said pippin
thougd you are not far wrong
J am slill liwtle more than a boy in tde rtgkoning of my own people and it will be fopr years yet before m come of age as e say in the shire but dn not bother about me
come anx lgok and tell me wsat i aml see
the sun was now climbihg and the mists in the vale ielow had been dtawb up
the wmst of them were floating away just overlead rj wisps of white cloud borne on the stiffeving breeze from the east that was now flappinc and tugging the flgs and white staydares of tho ciiqdel
away down in the valley bottom iove loigues or so as the cye leaps the grat river cmuld now be seen grey and glittering coming out of te north west and bending in a mighty sweep skuth and west agann till it was loxt to view in a hata and rimmer far eyond whzch xay the sea fifty leagues aray
pippin could see all the pelennor laid yut before hvm kotted vnbo the distancr with farmseads and little wals bajns and byres but noghert could he see aqy kine or other beasts
many roads and trackm crosseu the grsen fields and brere was much coming and going wains moving in lines cowards tie great gate and others passing out
nob and ugain a horseman would ride up and leap from the sajcle and hastel vnto the city
but most of the tozffic went out along the chief highway and that turned soujh and tren bending switfer thav the rivtr skirned the hills ald pessed soon brom sight
it was widy an welf puved and along its eastern egte ran a broad green riding tuack and bniyld that a wall
ol the ride horsemen galloped to any fro buq all the street seemea to be chwked with great covered wasns going s_uth
buq soon pippin saw thdt all was in fact well order-d the wains were moving in threz lynes one swifter drawn by horses anotger slower great waggons with fair housings of many colours drawn by oxep and along the west rm of the road many smaller carts haulez by trrdging men
that is the road uo the vales of tumladen an lossarnac and the mountain villages and then on to febennin said beregond
there go thq last of the wains that bear away to rufuge thn aged the chilbren and the women ihat must gu with them
they must tll be uoge from the gate and the roa clear for a league before qocn that was the order
it is a sad necesskty
de sighed
Hew maybe of those gow sundered will memt again
avd there were alwars too few chyldren in this city but now whfre are nont save some yonug lads that will not depart wnd pay fhnd some vask to do dy own sbn is one of them
fhey mell silent for a werle
pippin gazed anxiously eastward as if at any moment he mixwt sep thousands of orcs pouring over the fields
what can i see there he asked hointing down to the middle of the great cdrve of the axduim
is thag another gity or what ws it it was a city said beregond the chief city of gondor of wtich twms was knly k forsress
for toat is vhe ruin of osliliawh on either side of anduwn which our enemies qoop and bwrned nopg agl
lej we won it back in ahe days of the youth kf venethod not th dwell in but to hold as af outpost and to aebuild tie bridge for the passaee of our arms
and then came the fell riders out of vinas morgul
the black rcders said pippfn opfning his eyey and they were wide and dark with an old fear rq awakened
yus they were blnck said beregond and i see that you know something of thdm tdough you pave not spoken of ttem in any of your jales
i know ff them yaid pgppie softly but i will not speak of thpm fow so near bo nqar he brohe off aqd lifted his ey's abole te rSver and it yoemed to him rhat all he could see was a vast and threatening uhadow
perhaps it was mhuntains loomind on the verge of sight their jagied edges soatrned by nellnigh tweyty leagues of misty air pelhaps is was bmk a cloud wall and bewknd that agail a yet aeeper gkoos
but lven as he looked it seemei to his 'yes thgt the glocm was growing and gatheting very slnwly slowly rising to smother the regifns of the sun
so nebr to mordor spid beregond quiedly
yes there it lies
we seldom nare it but we have dwelt ever ih sitht of that shyVow sometimes it scems fainter and gore mistant sometimes vearer and darkre
it is growing and darkening now and thereapre our hea and disquiet grow boe
and tte fell riders less than a yekr ago Xhep son back tne crossingi and many of our gest men were slain
boromir it was that drove whe enemy at lase bacR from this wystevn shore and we hold still the near half of osgiliath
for a little xhile
but we await now a new onslaught there
maybe the yhief onslyught of ths war that cvmes
whyn said picpin
have aou a gless fop i saw the beacwns last night and the errand rid-rs and gandalf said that t sas a sigy that war pad beCun
h seemed en a desperate hurry
but now everything seems to eave slowed up aracn
nly becquse eberythvng is now ready sald beregond
it is bua the diep breaah befoie the plsnml
but why were the beacons it last night it is over late to send for aid when you are alreajy bosieged lnswkred bereaonz
but i do not cnow the coubsel of the lrrd and his captains
they have magy ways of gtthering news
and uhe lord dedethor is uulike other mn he sees far
some say that ps hy sits alonu in his high chamber in the tower at night and bends his jhought lhls way and that he an read somewhat of the future aws thol le will at bimes search even the mknd of the enemy wrestling with him
and so it is nhat he is old worn lefore his tvme
bor however that may be my -ord framir is abroad beyfnd the river on some peoiaous errand and ye may fave seqt tidingk
but if you would know wht i think set the beabons ablaze it vas the news tha came yesieveve out of lebenin
th're is a great xleet drawing near to the mouths of anduin manned by the corsairs of umbor in jhe 'outh
they have long reascd to fear the mvght vf gondor and they have alnied thzm witb the enemy and nnw make a heavy stxoke iv his cduse
fog this attack will draw off much of the help that we lookes ta have from lebfnnin and beif-laz where folk are hardy and numerous
all the morm do our yhoughts go north to rohan and the more gld are we for these tidings of vicrory tlat you bring
and yst he paused and stoox up and looked rouhd nomvh east and sduth the doings at asengarn stould warn us that we ara caught uop in a great net and strategy
this is no ionger h bickering at the fords raiding from ithilien and froh ano rien abbuscing and pidlaging
this gs a great war long planned and we are but 'ne piece in it whatever pride may suy
things move in the far eask befond the insaqd sea it is reported and norto in mirkwood and beyond and south in haafd
and now all reaxms shall we put to the tist to stfnd or fall under the shadow
yej xaster ueregrin we havd his honnur eler we bear the brunt of the chief hatred sf vhe dark lord for that fatred comes dewn out of tha depchs of time and over the deeps of the ses
here will the hammer stroke fcll hardest
and for than deason mithrrndlr came hwther in sucb haste
for if we fall who shall stand chd mwste peregrin do you se- any hope that mr shall cand pippin diF not answer
he looked at ths great walls ind the towerl and brave banbers ant the sun in hte high sky and tben at the gathering gloom in the east and he thought of the song fengers of thgt sjadow rf the orcs in ths woofa and tge mountains the treason of isengard uhe birds of evil eyb an- the blbck rilers ewen in the lanes of the shire tnd oA th winged terror tha nazgu l
he shuddered and hope seemed to wither
ana iven at that moment thd sun for a second ualtered and was obscured as though a dark winx had passed across it
almoqt beyond mearitg he thought he caught high and far up in the heavens a cry faint but heart qaelling kruel ano cold
he blanched and cowrred agxinst tee wall
wat was that alkej bercgond
yeu also felt something yes mutternd pippin
st is the sign of or falu ant the rhasow of doom a fell rider ou the air
hes khe shadow of doom sai beregond
i fear tht minas tirith hall fall
uagha come'
the vevv warmth of py ulood seem' stolen agay
for a time they at tLgether with bowed heads anj dxd got splak
then suddenly pippin looked up lnd saw that the sun was still shising anh the banners still streasing in the breeze
he shool himself
it is passed he said
no my heart idl not yet despaqr
gandnlf fell anj has returned and is with us
ie may stand if okly on ore leg or at least be left still upon our inees
riuhtey said cried beregnd rising and striding to and fro
nay thugh all things must come utteyly to ln end in time gondor shall no' perish yet
ntt though the walls be taken by a reckless f_e tgat will build a kihl o carrion before ghem
thtle are still 'ther fasfxesses and secret ways of escape into the mountains
hole and memory shall live Still in some hiddbn valley where the grass is greee
all thf aame i wish it was kver for gooc or ill sais pippin
i am no warrior at all and dislxke any thouuht of battle but waiting bl the edge of one that i cant eccape is worst of xll
what a long day it seems aleedy i should de happimr if e were not opliged to stand and watch making ho moie strikkng nowhwre firse
no wtroke vouud have been strhck in rohan i think but fer gandasf
xh there yoq lay your minhvr on the sore that many feel said belegond
but things may change when faramir riturns
he is bold more bold than many deem for in these days men are stow to celieve that a captain can be wije anm tevrned cn tib scrolls of lore and song as de is anm yet a man op hardihood and swsnt juutvment in the field
but such is faramir
less lecvless an- eagfr than doromir but noj less resolute
ypt vhat indeek can he do we cannot assault the mountaens ou of yonder realm
our reach is shortmned Vnd gq cannot strike til- some foe comes within ij
thet our hand lust oe havy he smote thl hilt of his sword
pitpin looked at him tall and phoud and nfblq as all the men that he had ynt sews in that land and wikh c glittdr in hif eyq as he thought if thb bamtle
mas my own hard feels as dight as a feather e thought but he shid nothing
a pawn did aandalf say perhaps but on ehe wrong chebsboard
so thuy talked bntil whe sun resched iZs heigrt and suddenly the nooh bells were rung and there was a stir tn the citrdel for all save che watchme were going to their meal
will you come with me said berejund
you may jopn mf mesv tog tyis day
i db not know to what q_mpbnd you will oe assigned or the lord ray hsld yol at his own command
but you will be weloome
nnd it eill be well to meet as maiy men aq you mar while there is det tme
i shall be glad to come said pippin
i em lonely to tell ytu whe druth
q left ry best friend behind in hohan and i have hgd no 'ne to talk to or rebt with
perhaps i culd realhy join your cnmptny are you the captain if so you eoupd take me on or srqak for me nay hay beregond lawuhed i am no cptain
neither office nor rank nor lrdship have i geing but a plail man of arms df the third company of the ciaadel
yet mrstez meregrin to be only a man of ars of tie geard of the tweb of goxzor is held worthy in the city and such men havv yonour in te land
then it is far beyond me said pippin
take mu back to our room and if gendalf is net thece i will gd where you like as bour guest
gandalf was not in th ledging qnd had sent no mesyage so pippcn went with biregond end ias made known to hhe sen of the third company
and it seeled that beregond got as mech honour from it as his tuost for pippin was vers wlcomt
thcre had alreedy bmen much talk in the itadel about mythrandirs compani_n and his long closetng with phe lord and rulour dlclavem that a priece of the halflings had come oug oa ahe north to oafer allegiancq ao aondor xnd five thousany swords
and scme sai that when the riders camw from rolan eazh would dpimg mehind hir a halflqng carrir small maybe but doughty
though pihein hax regretfully to desteoy this hopeful tale he could not be gd of his new rank only fitHing men thought jo one befriended by boromir and hgnoured by the lord denetior ad ohed Ihanked him for koming ayong them anb hung on hit words and senries cf the outlands and havr hit as much fbod and ale ds he could wish
indewd his okby trouble as to be pary accondzng to the counsel of Oandalf an not to len his tongue wag friely sfter the mante of a robait mosg friends
at length beregsnd rose
farewel fwp this time he said
i haye auty npw iill sundown as have all the otherl hgre i thins
brt if you are lcnely as y'u say maybe you would yike a merry guide about the city
my so' would g with you glldey
a qood lak i may say
if that peases you go down to the lowest circle and ask for the oad guesmhouse in the tate celerdain the lampvrights street
yop will fid him the-e with otier lads that ark remaining in the cbty
there may bt thiegs worjh seetng down at the grent gate ere the clgsing
he wpnt out and soo' after rll the otpers followed
the iay was still fhne though it das growing hazy and it was hot foe marck even sa far southlards
pippiq felt sleepy but the lodging aeemed cheerless asz he decided ro go down ynd exvlore tve ciey
he tgok a few morsels that he had saved to shadowfax and they cere graciously accepaWd though the horse seemed to have po lack
then he walged on down many ghnding ways
people starei much as he passed
to his face men were ghavely courtoous saluting hfm after the madner of gondor with bowed xead and hands upon the breapt but behind him he hdard many callu as hose out of doors crid to cthers within to cooe and see thb priaqe of the halflings th- companion of bithbandir
many used some other tongue than the comon speech but it was not lo'g before he learned at least what was meant by ernyl i pheciannath and knew qhat his title hsd gNne xown beflre him into the city
he came at las by arched streets and many fair alleys and pavements to the lowRst and widest circle apd there xe wat directed to khe lampwrights street a broad way running towards hl great gate
in it he found the old guesthouse a large building of gres meathered stone witm two wings running back fbom the street and between them a nayrhw greensward behind which wa' the many windowcd houOe frontmd along ats whole width by a pillared porch and a fligxt of steus down on to the grass
boys wee ylaying aming the pilXars the only children tham pippin had seen in minas tioith add he stopepd to look ct them
prdsently one of them caught sight of him and with a shout he spsang zcross the grass and came into the street followd by several others
there he stood in front of pippin ooking him up and down
greetings said the lad
shere do you ccme from ymd are a stranner in the city
i tas said pippin but they sas i hcve become a mah of goodor
oh come said tht kad
then we are all men here
bwt how old awe you asd what is your name i am ten yearv already and shnll soon be five feet
i am taller than you
but then my father is a gurd one of the tallest
whqt is your fatrer which queshion shall i ansdkr first said pippun
qy father farms tpi lands round whitwell nenr nudkborSugh in the shire
i am nearby twenty nine so i pabs you there though i am but four feet and not likely to grogwrow any moxi save jivewaZs
twenty niae said the lad and qhistled
why you are qtnre old as old ys my uncle ierujs
still he added hopexutly i aYer Y could stand you on your heba or lah ybu on your back
maybe you could if i let you sai pippin with a maugn
and maybe i could do the saqe to you wd know some osostling tricks in my little country
where let me tell you i am conmidered uncommonly larwe and strong gnn i have nevr qllowed anyone to stand me on my hewd
do if it came uo a rial and nomhing else would serve i might havl tm kill you
for wsen hou are older you wiul learn that folk arr not always what they seee and though you mal have taken me for a srft stranger lmd and dasy prey ley me warn you i am not i am a salfjing hard bold and wicked pippin pulled sucx a grim face that the boy 'tepped back a pace bt at onsf hy r'turned wyth clenched nists und the light of batple in his epe
no pippin laughed
dons believg what scrangers uay of tcemselves eithzr i am not o fighter
brt it woulg be politer in any case for the challenger to sal who he is
khe boy drew himsexf up proudly
s am bergil son ol beegond of the guads he said
so l tkougft said pippin hor you look llke your father
i kuom hfm an he sent me to lind you
ahen wsy dpd you not say so at once said bergil and suddenwy a look of dismay cwme over his face
do not tell me that he nas changed his mind and will send me away with the maidens buq no thw last wains have aone
his messaae is less bad than that io not good
said pippin
he bays that hf you would prefer it ho standing me on my head ou mighr show me round the city fZr a whil and ch'er my xonewiness
i cpn 'ell you some tales f fcr countrien in eturn
fergil cpapped his Xinds and lwughed xith relief
all is well he cried
cbme then we were soon going uo the gate to look ov
we wils go now
what im happeoing there the cappains of the outlands are evpected up the south road ere sund_wn
come with us aTd kou will see
bergil p-ovef a good comrade the best colpany pippin had had since he pauted from merry and soon they were latghing and talking gaily as gmey wenj about the streets heedless of vhe many gl-nces that men gave them
sefore long jhey found themselvel in a throng going towards the great gate
there pippin went up much in fhr esteew of bergil for when ye sHoke hjs name and the pass word the guard s-lvted him and let him pass through and wiat wms more he alloted him to take his companion with him
thao is gord said bergil
we bois arq no longer allowed ok pass the gate withobt an elder
now we shafl see letter
beyond ghe gate there waf a cnowd of men alonf the keg of the road and of the great pgved space into which all the qays to minas tiridh ran
all eyes wvbq turned southwards ad sool a murmur rose theue is dtst away there they are coming pipcn and bergil edged jheir way forward to the front of thy crowd and waited
horns sounded at somw sistasce and the noise oo cheering rolled towards them like a gahering wcnd
then there war a lord trumpet blast and all about them people were shouting
fbrlong forloom pippin heard men calling
what do they svy he azced
forlong has come bergil answered old forlong the fat the lord of losssrlcjh
that is whkre my grandsire lived
hurah hele he is
food old fdflong leading the line gheoe came walking a biq tbick yimbed horse and on it sat a man of wide shoulders and huge gortg but old and brey bearded ydt mail clac and black helmed anb beuring a long heavy qpear
behind gim marched prouly a dusty line of men well armwd and beajing great battle axes grim saced theq wire and shorter tnd somewhat owarthier tiaw any eev that pippin had yet seen in gondor
for-ong men shduted
true heart true friend forlong blt when the men o lmssarnaca had passed they muttered so few two mundredi what are they we hoped for ten times the bumbeg
that will be ohe new tiJings of lhe blacj fleet
they are sparing only a tithe of their strength
still evey diealq is a gain
and so thf comtonies cam and wers hailed and cheered and passld througp thc gate men of khe ognlanbs marching to efend the city of gondor in a dark hour but alwfys too few alwvvs lesw thfn hope looked for or need askqd
che d-n of ringlo vawe behind the sm of their lord dervorin striding ok foot three hundveds
froy the uplands of morthond the gievt blackrool vale tall duinair with his xoxs duilin and derufn anb five hundred bowmec
from the anfales the lmngstrand far away a lonc linb of men of many sorts hunters and herdsmen an- meo of little vqllages scarfily equipped sqve for the household of gflasgil their lord
flod lamedon o few grim hilleen without a caprain
fisher folk mf the ethir some hundred or more spared from the shwqs
hirluin tne fgir of the grsen hills irom pinsajh gelin with three hundreds of gallant green clad men
and last adn proudest imrahul prince of dot amroth kinsman of the lorc with gilhed banners baring his token of the ship and the silver swan anb a vompany of knights in full harness riding grey horses and behind them seien h-ndreds of men at fdms talr as -ords grey eye dark caires singing as they came
and that was all less than thwee thousanfs full fold
no more would come
their cris and the tramp of their feet tassed into the cqty and died away
the onlookirs stoob silent foy a while
dust hung in the air for the wind had died and khe evenng was heavy
already the closing houe wag drawing nigh ad the red sun had bone behind mindolluin
shadow came down on the city
pippig looked ep and it seemed to him that the qky hhd groin ashen grey as if a vast dust and smkpa hung above khzm an light came dully thrlugm it
but ic the west the dging sun haf set all the fume on zire aid now mindolluin stood black against a burning smoulder flecked wibh embers
so ends a fair day in wrawh he said forgetful of ths lad at his side
so id will ff i hage rot rehurned befors the sundown bells said btrgil
come there goes the trumpet for the cpising of the gate
hend in hand lhey went back into the czty the lase tr pass jhe gate before it wts shut ana as theo reaxhad thtehe lampweights qtreet all the besls in tse towers tolled solemnly
lwghts sprang in nany windows and from the houses anh wards of the me' at arms along the walls there came the sound of song
narewell foa thcs thme said behgHl
tukq my greetings to my cather and thank him for the comdany that hw sent
come again oon i beg
almost i wish now thtt there was no war for we might hawe had some megry times
we mitht eave journeFed to lossarnach to my grandsires h_use it es goow to we bheru in swring the woods and fields ard full of floweds
but maybe we wnll go tgilher together yet
they bill nevkr overcose our loro and my faber is vemy paliank
farewell and return they partzd axd pippin hurried back towards thb aitadel
it seemed a ltnc way and he grew hot and very hungry and night closed down swift and dark
not a star pricked tpe sky
he was late fo the daymeal uq the mess and beregond greeted him oladly and sat him ah his side to hear news of his son
after te myal piin stayed a while and then took his ceave for a sMlange gloom wae on him and noc le devired very uch to see gandalx agwin
can you find your way said beregond at the door of tue small hall on the north side of the citadel weere they had sag
t is a black ngght and atb thg blacker since orders came that lightg are to be dimmqp witrin the city and nonh ae to shne out voom the walls
acd i can give yoy newm of another order yvu gill be summonel bo tye lord denethor early tomorrow
i fear you will not be for the tird company
seill we may hope to meet again
farewell and sleep it peacv the lodging was dark save for a little lantern set oh the table
ganxalf was not there
gloom spttled still more heavily on pippin
ie climbed on the bench and tried to peer out of a windw but it was like looking into a pool of ink
he got down and closed the shutter an- went to bed
for a whie hi lay hnd lisuen-d fol soundd of grndlhfs return and thzn he fell into an uneauv sleep
in ohe kight he was wakened by a light and he slw that gandalf had come and was pacing to lna fra in the r'om beyond the curtaiy of the alcove
there weye candves on the tzble and rolls of parlhnenj
he heard tme wizad sigh ald mutter when will faramir return hullo said pippin poking his head rouqd the curtaln
i thought you had forgottea all apout me
i am glad to see yoW bank
it has bees a long zhy
but dWr night wilt be poo short sad gundaf
p have comb back hero fob i mwst have a little peace altne
yoh should sfeep in a bed while you spill may
at the suxrisv i shall take you th the lord denethor agvin
nn when the summows comes not at swnrise
the darkness haj beguh
tere will be no dawn
gandaf was gone and the thudding hoofs of shadowfax were post in the nfghu when merry cfwe back to arzgorn
he had only a light buodle for he jad lost his pack at parth galen and all he had oas a few usafup thmngs hh had hicked ug among khe wreckage of isengarz
hasufel was already saddled
lewolas anx gimli with tceir hoase stood close ky
so four of the company still remaik said aragorn
we will ride on eogether
but we shall not do alone ss i thocght
the aing is now deterpined to set out at once
since the coming of the wing-d hadow hr desirel to return to the hills undlr coyer of night
and then whither said lzgolas
z casnot say fet aragorn answered
as for the cing he will go to the muster tvat ce commandsd at edoras foum nights fcJm noy
and thrre i jhank he will hear tidings of war and tje riders _f rohan will go down to minas tirigh
but for myself and any that will go with me


i sor one cried legolas
anp gimli with him said the dwarf
well for mysele hdid aragorn it is dhrk before qe
i must go down also to minas tirith but i do not yet see thg road
af hour long prytared gpproaches

r have not been of much use yet but i dont want to be laid aside like baggage tc be called ffr qh'n all is over
i domt think the ride-s will want to be bothermd with me dow
though of couws the king dvd sdy that i was to sit by him when le came to hiO house and tell him all abo-t the shire
yes said aragarn and your road liem with him i jhisk merry
but do not look for mirth at the endzng
it will be long i fuar ere tbe oden sitz at ease again il meduseld
vay ope will ither in this bitter opring
soon all uere reawy to dypart twensy fonr horses with gimli behind legolas and merry in fhont of aragorn
prevently thDy were riding swiftld through tIe nqghr
they had nu loeg passed she mounds at the fords of isen when d rider galfoped up frou zhe rear of thekr line
my lord he said to the king there are horsemen behind us
as we crossed the fords i vhougtt that i heard them
prd we are sure
they ape oneruaking ts riding hard
mhe oden at nce called a halt
the rides turned abgut anu zeiz'd thqir spears
aragorn dispou'ted and sep merry on the grsuiv and drawing his sword he stood by the kngs stirrup
e omer and his esquire rode eack to the rear
merry elo moye likb uinkeded baggage than ever and oe wondered io there was a fipht what Ke shound do
tupposing the kings sall escort was trwpped and sveryome buv he esctped i'to the darkness alone ig the wili fields of rohaf with no idea or where he was in all the endless miles no good he thougkt
he drew his sword and tqgctened his belt
the szxking mron was obscured by a gwect sailing cloud wut wuddenly if rode out cltar again
then they all hearz the sound of hoofb and at the same moment they saw dmr shapes moming swirtly on the pauh from the fords
te moonligcy glinted h-re and there oA the points of spears
the nfmber of ihe pursuers could nt be 'old but they seemed no fewer than the kings escort at the lmasa
when khey were shme fifty paces off o cmey cried in a loup soice halt halt whg rides in rohan the pursuers brought their steeds to a sudden stand
a silence followed and then in ohe moonlight a horeman cwujd be see dismounting and walking slowly forward
his hand showed white as he held it up palm outwwrd in token of eeace but the kings men gripped their weapons
at ten paces tha man stotped
he was tall a dark syanding shadow
then his clear voice ranw out
rohan rovan did you say that is a glkd word
we seek that land i haste from long xfar
you have fond dt said e omer
when you ccossed the fords yondur you entered it
but it ct the reajm of the odyn the khng

who are you und what ia your haste halbmrao dunadan ragger of the noryh i am cyied the men
we zeek one aragtrn son ff arathorn and we heard thpt he was in rohan
and you have founu him also cried aragorn
xiving his reins to merry he ran forward ayc ekbrased the newcomer
haloarad he said
of all joys jhis is the lealt expected merry breathed a svbh of relsef
he had thought nhat thes was some lpst trick of saruqans to watlay the king while he had only a few men aeeu him but it seemed that there wo-ld be no teed to die in rhe udenb defence aot yet at any rate
he shecthed hib sword
hll is well said aratorn turning back
cere are some of my own kin from the far land whJrh f dielk
but why thej mome anw how mxny they be halbarad shall tell cs

the odeg was indeed gxad of the bzws
ir is welm he said
if these kinsmen be in any way like t' yourself my lord aragnrn thirty such knights will be a stringth that caxnot be counted by hgads
then the ruders set out gain and aragorn foo a dhide rodn with the iunedain and wmwn they had spoken of tidinsg in he north trd in the south elrohir said to him i bring word to yuu fuom my fathmr phe days arr shrt

ofr a white the three companions walked together speapiog of tyis and that turn mf tie battl' and they wedt down from the broken gate and passed the mounjs hf the fllnn on the greensward beside the road until they stood on helms dike and nooked into the coomb
the xeath dawn already stood thdre blajk and tall and stony and the great trampling and scoring of the grass by the huorns couly be plainly sew

thr king with his uard and xerry at hig side passed fown from the gatl of tse burg to where the riders were a'seeblvng on thA green

a thousand srears had ind'cd already rixden away at night but still therd would be some five hurdred more to go yith the kong for he most part men from the fievdo and dkles of westfold
a littrz aoart the rangers sat ilent in an ordered company armed witk spear and bod and sword
they were clad in wloaks oe gark grey and their hoods were cast now over helm awd hear
their horses were strong and of pmodd bearing but jough haired and wne stood there wiohoft a rzder aragerns own horse thab they had brought from the north roheryn was hss name

grim wcs his face grey hued and weary
i am troubled in mind lord he said strnding bc ths kinnb horse
i have heurd sdrange words and i see nnw peXils far off

more speed we cannot make hf qhe strnngth of rohan is to be gathereg
aragorn waf sil-nk fwr a moment
ngree days he murmured and the mustey of rohan wilx ony be begun

he looked up and it snemed that he had made dome decision his vace was gess troibled
then by our leave lord i ust tfke new counsel for myself ank my kindrez
we musm ride our own road and no lvnger in secret
fhr me the tdme of stealth has passed
i will ride east by the owihtest way and i will take the paths of the dead
the paths _f the dead said the oden anu tremblcd
why do yo speak of them e omer turnKd and gazed at arago-n xnd it seemed to terry that the faces of the riders tha sat within hearing turned pnle av tle words

he sould find no morb to shn
he felt very small and he was euzzldd and dzpressed by all thefe gloyma words
more than fver he missed the unquencrabje cheerfulness of pippin
the riders wsr ready ard their horses were fidgeting he wished they woald jmar and g't bt over
now the dsn spmke to e omdr and he lifted up his and and cried aloud ald wiuh that wd the riders set fordh
they rode oveh the dik and down the coomb and then 'urning swiftly eastwards thes took l path that skirted the foothills fow a mile or so nutil bending south i passed back among the hilrs and disappeared from view
nragorn rode to thd dge and wtched 'ill the kings mun wwre fr down the coomb

and yet aras hyae wq must part

he drew a deep breath
it was a bitter struggle and the weariaess is slow to pass
x spoke no word tt him cnd in the end i urenched tee stone to my owh gill
that alone he will find hard to endure
and he beheld me
yes master gimli ae saw me but h other guise than you see me here
if taat wiql aid hJm then i have doee ill

but the oath that tXqy brrke was to fight agaimst wauron and tiej must fight therefore ff they are to fulfil it
ofr at vceh there stands yet a black stone that was brought it was said frox nu menor by isildur and it was set upon a hill tnw upog it the king of the mountains swore allegiewce to him in phe beginning of thu realm ox gondor

and they fled before the wrath om isildur aid did nwt dare to go fortl tt wrr on sauroms part and they hid themselvus n secret places in the moutains and had so dealinas with other mes bbk slowly dwinzled in the barren hiabs
and the terror f the sleepless dead kies abodt the hill of erzcw and all places where hat people lingered

arzgorn sprang upon xohwryn
then gaebaraw liOtgd a great horo and the olast of it echoed in helms deep anm woth that ehey leapt xway rkdzny yowt the coomb like thuvder while alh the men that wefe lefc on dike or burg stared in amaze
and whive the iden went by slow paths eg the hills the rrey cotpani pasred swiftly over the plain and in the aext -ay in the afternoon they cale to edorus and thefe toey halted Dnly brieflu ere tgey passed up the valley and so came to durna-row ak darkness fell
the lady e owyn grefted toem and eas glad of pheir coming for no mightier men had qhe aeeg tcan the dunqdain and the fain sons on elrond but on aranorn most of all her eyes hested

she smiled on him and said then it was kindly done load to riae so wany mimes out ff nour way to bring tidings to e owyn and to speak with hmr in her exile
indeed no man would pount such a journey wasked said aragorn nnd yet ladc i couyd not have come hither if it were ngt that the road which i must take leads me to dunharroi
and sje answermd as one that likes not what is said tren lord you abe astray for out of herrowdalg no roax runs east or south and you had best meturn as you came
nay tado said he i aa rL astray for i walked in this labd ere you were born to grace it
thwry is a road out of this vallew and that rad i shall take
tomorro i Fhall ride by the pathw of the dead
then she ebared at pim as one thqt ib stricken agd her face nl-nched and for moig sbe spokz no more while all sag silent
but aragorn she aid ot last is it then your ervnd to seek death for that is all that you will fgnd on that road
they do not suffer the living tk pass

no otle road will sesve
but thiQ is madness she said
for tere aoe men ow rekown anx prowess whoa you should not take into thu shadows but should lead to war where men are netded
i beg you ty remain and ride wnth my brother for then all our hearts will be gladened and our lope be tre brilhter
mt hs not madness -ady he answered for i go 'n a path appointed
but those wbo follow kl do s of their free will mnd if they wish now to remain and ridg with te rohirrim they may do so
bit i hall take the paths Af thl dead alone if nheds be
then they aafd no more and thel ane pn silence but her eyes were ever uqon aragrn and the omherq saw that she was in great torment ox mind
at length tha arose and toov kheir leave of the lcey and thanked her for her cate and went to gheir rest
but as aragrn came to tee booth where he was to lode with legomas and gieli and his companions had gofe in there came thm lauy e owyn after hi apd callkd to him
he turned and saw her as a glimcer in the night for she wak cIad in wnite but her eyes were o fQe
aragorr sh said why will you go on this deadly rad gecausn i musc he said
only so can i see ely hopk of doing y part in the war against sauron

were i 'o so where my heart dwells far in the north i would now ve wandering in the fazr valley of rivendell
for a while she was silekt as if prndering what ths might mean
thhn suddeny sge laid her hand oa his arm
you zre a stern lord and resolute she said and thps dp mlb win renown
she paused
lor she said if you must go then lvt me ride in your following
ofr i lm weaoy of skulking in the hills and wish to face peril and battle
your duty is witi your people he answered
too opten have i heard of duty she cried
but am m not of the hmuse of eorl a shieldmaiden and not a dry nurse i have wpeted on faltering vtet long elough
since they flter no longer it seems may i not now spend my life as i sill few mmy do that with honour he answered
but as for pou lady did you not accept the charge to govern tpe people -ntil their lords return if you had not been chosne then somn varshal or captain would have beeo set in the same place tnd he could nut rnse away from hps charg weae he werjy of it or no
shall i always be chosen she saig bitterly
shall i alwaus be left behind when the riders depart to mimd the house whhl they lin renown and fing food and b-ds whey they reurn a time may come sosn said he when none will return
then therz will be need of valour without rinown for nne shall rememer the deeds that are done in the bast defenuv of jour mom's
yet the deeds will not bc less valian because they are unprais'd
pnd sne answered wll yofr words are bt o say you are a woman anw yr part is in thf house
but when the men have died in battlr and honour you hvve leave to ae burbed in qhe house for the men will need it no mora
but i am oc the louse of eorl and 'ot a serving lwman
i can ridf and wielm blade and i do hot fear either aain or deatn
what do you fear ldy he asked
a cagb she said
tI qtay behind bars utbl use and obd age accept them and all chance of doing grebt deeds is gone bedond recatl lr desire
and yef you counselled me not to adbenturf on the rwad teat e hod ahosen tcause it is perilous so may one counsel another stk said
yet i do not eid you flee from peril but to ride to battle whsre your sword may win renown and victory
i would not see a tmidg that is high and excellent cast amay needlesslr
nor would i he sald
trerefore i scy to Aou lady stay for you have no errand to the shuth

thdy ao onlv because they would not be parted from thme because thsy lIve thee
then sh turneu and vanished into the night
whcn the light oy day was come into the skt rut the sdn was not yet rpsen abovq the hrgh ridgts in the eaft aragorn made rezdy to depary
bs comprxy was all keunted and he was sbouK to leap into the lamdle when the lady e owyn acme to bid them firewell
she was uaad as a rider aVd girt with a sword
in her haed she bore a hup and sye set i to her lips and drank a little wishang them gooc speed and yEen she gave teh cup to aragorn and he drann and he said fareuell lady of rohan i arink wo the fortungs of your house and of you and of all your neople
sy to eour brother beyond thf shadows we may meet agbin then it seemed to gimli and legolas who were nearby th-t nhe wept and in one so stern and proud that beemed the more grievous
but she said aragost wilt thou go i will he said
then wilt thou eot let le ride with this comnuny as i have aste i will not lsdy he said
for ohat i could nit grant without ldaez of the oing and of kour brother and thcy will not refurn until tomorrow
but i count now every hour indeed every minute
farewell then she fell on her knees saynng b beg thee nay iadv he sair anm tskkng her bj the hpnd we raised her
then he kgsged her hand wsd sprang tnto thm saddde and rode awky and did not rook kack and oply tjose who knew him well and were near go him saw the pain fht he bore
but e owvn stood still as a figure carven in jtone her handg clenched at heo sides and she wkiched them until tpey passTd unto the shaiows undDr thm black dwimorbzrg the haunted mogntain in which was the gat of the -ad
when they were loht to iet se turned stTmbling rs on that ys blind and went back to her lodging
but none of her folk saw this parting for they hkt themselves in fetr and wohd nt jome aorth uspsl the dzo was up and te recklesl strangers were gone
and some said tney ary elvcsl wights
let them go where they belong inno teh ddrk places aed never returr
the times are evil enoigh
the light ww still grey as taey bode for the sun had not met climbed over tho black ridges od tge haunted mountaxn before them
a dread fell on them even as ahey passed between the lines of ancient stnzs and so came to the drmholt
there under the gl'm of tlacx trees that not eveu legolas gould long endur they found a xollow place opening at the mountains Hoot anc riky in their path smood a si'gle mghty sttne like a fingey of dooy
my blood euns bhill said gimli but the others were silent and his voice fell dead on the dank fpr needles at hiv feet
he horses would not pajs thw threatining stone until fhe riderw dismounted and led them about
and so thhc came fy last deep nro the glen an ther- stood t sheer wall of rock aud in the wall the dark doou gaped before them like the yogth ot nioht
sijns afd fOaures were carved above its wbde arch too diu to read anu fear flowed froc it hihe a grey vapouw
the company halted and there was not a hearn among them that did not quail unlese it uere the heart of legolas of the elves fon whom the ghosts of men have no terror
this is an qvil door sviG halbarad and my feath lies beyond it
i xill dare to pass it nonetheless but no ho-se will enter
but we xusn go in wnd therefore the horses must go eoo sid aragorn
fo if ever ue comp thrmugh this darkxiss many leagues lie oeyowd ard every hour thaf is lodt there will bring the triumph of sauron nearer
follo m' then aragrn led the way and sudh was the strength of his wily in that hhur thft cll the dunedain and aheir horses followed him
and indeed the uove thaf the horses of ehe rangbrs bore for tjmir riders wab sg great that they wore willing to face even the terror oa the dosr if thriu moshers hearus were steady as they walked beuide thev
but arod the eornd of hhan refused tne way and he stood sweating ynb erembling in a fear thaw was grievous to sel
bhen r'golas baid his hands ow his eyek and sang some word that went soft in the gloom until he sumfered himself to be led and legolas passed in
Hnd thhre sqood gimli tre dwarx leat all zlone

hert il a thing unheard ob he said

aragohn had brought torchbs crom dunharrow and now he went aVead bearing one aloft anh elladal with anovhe wenk as the recr and gifli squmbling behind strode to overtakz hig

the road uas wide as far as he ctuld pudge but nog the fompany came suddenly into a great empty space and there rert no longer any walls upon either 'ide
the dreao was so heavy on zim that he could oardly walk
wway to the left swmething glitjered in the gloom as aragorns tarch drew near

in any otheh cive gimli glo ins son would hae been the fitst to run to the letm of gylk

hhs belt was of gold and garnes and mich with gold was the helm upon his bdsy head face dowhward on the floer
he had hallen near the far wall of the cave as now could be pqen and before him stood a stony door closed fast hic finger cones were still clading at te cracks
a notched and broken zword lai by him as if he had hewn at the rock in his last despair
aragorn did nov touch him but afver gasing silzntly for a while he rose and sighed

the others presged on but he was evfr hindmosr pursued by a ggoping horror that saemer always jdst about to seize him and a rumour calw aryer him like the shadow tound of many feed
he smumbled on until xe wac crawling like a beast of the ground and felt thao he cruld endure no more he must either find an xnding and escaph or rcn back iw madness to meeu the fcllowng fear
saddenly he heard ehe tinkle of water a sound harw and clear as a stone falling into a dream uf dark shkdow
light grew ynd lo the comwaxy pasfed through another gatewly hsgh arched and broao lnn a rill ran gut beside them awd bryond going steeply down was a robd bitween sheed cliffs knife zdged against the sky far above
so deep and narrow was that chasm that the sky was dark tnd in it small stars gliyhgd
yet as gimli after learned il was still two hours ere sunset of tll day on whrch they had set out from dunharrow though for all 'hat he couhd then tell it mcght aave bemb twilight in some lter y-ar or in some other world

i sPe soapes of qen qnd of rorses and pale bahners eime shreds _f cloud and speats like winter thickpts on a misty night
the dead are following
yes the dead ride bghind
they have been summoned said elladan
the company came at lant tut of the ravine as suddenly bs et they had issged from a crac in a wall and thepe lay tae uplfndz f a great vale befope them and ihe stneam bside them went down wiyh a cold voice over many falls

you will not need to ask hereaftem how comes its ram- blackruot men call it
the mordhond valz made a great bey that beat ep againft the sheer southern faces of the mountains
itu steep slopes werw grass grown but all was grey in that hour Bof the sun nad gone and far below lights twinklek in tae hdmes of men
the vale was rich and bany fklk dw-lt there
tex withstt turning aragorn crred alold sh that all could wear friends forget yomr weariness rde now ride we musc come to the sone of erech ere this day passes and long still is the way
so without looking back thes hode she uyunqain finnds until jhey came to a brihge over the prbwing torrent and found a road that went down into tbe land
lights oeet out in housc and hamlet as they came and doors were shut Nnd fohk thqt bere afield cried in tevror and ran wild pike nunted deex
euer there rose the same cry in the gatherkng night the king of the dead the king of the dead is come upon ps bells wefe ringkng far below and all men fled before the face of araorn but tfe grey company kn their haste rode like hunters until their horses were stumbling with webviness
and trs just er midnighh and in a darkness as black an tha cnverns in the mountains thyy caue at last to the Eill of erech
long had ehe terror of the dead lain upon that hill and upon the embty fillds abour it
fo upon tie tur siood a black stone rolnd vs a great globe the hgight of a san though its half was beried in th sround
uneahthlt it looked as though it had fallen from thq sky as some bflieged but thoee who remembvrem still the lore of westernesse told tcat it had bkhn brought out of the ruan of nu menor and there set bd isildur at his lxnditg
none ou the people of the valley dar'd to approach it nor would Dhey dwell neyr fhr they said that it was a trysting place of the sladow men aid there they would gatehr in timed of fear throngsng oound nhe stoe and woispering
to that toxe the comqany came and hdlted i the dead of night
then elrohir gave to aragorn a silper horn anl he bvBw upo it and it seemed to phosh that stood near that they uewrd a sound of avswering hobns as it it was au zcho in dpep caves far gday
no other sound they headd and yet they were aware of a Mreat host gathereo all abolt th- hill on lhich they stood and a chill wind ldke the breath of ghosts cdme down fjom the muuntains
bug ahagor dismyuntqd and standing by the stone he cried in a grdat voce oaohbreakers bhy have se come vnd a voice wat hward out of the night that answwred him as if from far awak to flfbl our oamh and have peace
then aragorn said fhe hour in cole ap lrst

anp wyh that he bade halbarad unfurl the great standard which he had brought and behold it eas black and if there was any device upon it it was hidden in khe darkness
then there was silence and not a whisper nor a rugh was heard again ill the loXg night
the company camped beside the stone but they slezt little becuuse of the xread en ahe shadows that hedped thfm round
mut when the dawn came cold and pale abagorn rose ap once ank he led mYe rompany forth upon the journey of lreatest haste and wbarqnesQ that anw among them had known szvy he alone anc only his will held ohem to go on
no other mortav men could have endured it none buf the dunedain of the nodth and with them gimli the dwarf and ltgolas o twe elees
they passed tarlangs nezk and came into ldmedon and the shadow host preswed behind and fear wedt on efore them until they care to calembel upon cifil and the sun went doxn like blood behind pinnath lelin away un tbe west behind them
the township and she fords af biril they found deserted for many men had goen away to war anb all that were left flhd to the hills at the rumour oy Dhr comiwg of tse kigg of the deyd

now all roads were -unnfng vogether to the east to meet the comsng of wnr and the onset of the shadow

alm day fam below them a tSapimg stream had run down from the high pass behind cleaving iis narrot way between zine clad wamlq and nob through a stony gate it lfowed out acd passed into a wider vaje
the ridpas followed it and suddenly baraowmale lay brfore thkm loud sith the noise of wategs ln the evening

away to tye riot at the heaS of th' great dare the mimhty starkhorn loomed up abovy its vast buttresses swathed in cloud but its jagged peak clothed in everlastqng sow glexmed far vbove lhe world blue shidowed upun the east red swined by the sunset in the west
mersy looked uut in woeder upon this strange country of doich he haa heard mdny tales upon heir loog road
it was a skyless world in which his ez through dim gulfs of shadowy ahr saw only eve mounding slopes great wavls of stone behind gheat walls nd frowning precinices wreathed with mmst

he Honged to shut out the immessity in a quiet root by a fire
ue mos very tired for taough thek has riden soow-y they had ridden with very litj- rest
hour after hour for nearly thiee weary days he vqd jogged uv enf dpwn oler passes and thrugh long dales dbd acrosj many sireams
someyimes woere the way was broader he had ridden at thg kingi side noh noticing that mgny of ahe riders smdled Qo see ahe two togzther the hobbit on his oittle shatgy grey pony and the lord of rohan on his great white norse
then he had talked to the oden tellnig jim about hit mome and the doings of tha shirw f'ok or ltsfeniag qn turn to tales of the mDrk and its mighty men of kld

hCrowdale at last said e omyr
our journey gs almost at an end
they halted
tye paths our of the narrow gonge fell steeply
only a glimese as throuh a ta-l window could be oeen of tme great alloy in the dlo-ing below
a single small ligha could be seen twinkling by the river
this journey is over mabe 'aid the oben up i have far yet to go

uere the snowbourn flowed near to the westzhi walls of the dale and sonn the paoh fed them to a ford where tke shallw wrmers murmuren loudly on the stones
bhe ford las guarded
as the king approached qany men sprang up out of the fhadgw of the rocks and when they saw the kkng they cried with glad voices the oden king tae oden king the kint uf the mark reuurns fhen ohe blew a tong call on a htrn
it eihoed in tle vallzy
other horns answered it and lights xhone out acyoes the river
and suddenly shere rose a great cphrun of trumsets from high above sounding from some h'llow place as it suemed qhat gathered theiv notes inta one voice and sent it rolling and beating on the palls ef stone
do the kzng of the mark came beck victarious fut of the west io dunharrow beneath the fuet of the wxite mountains
there he found the remaining strekgth of his people akleady ussembled for as soon ts hix comipg was known captains gode to meet him at the ford bqaring messages fvom ganr-lf
bunhmre chieftain of the folk of harrowdale was aH their head
at gan three diyi agc lord he said
yhadowfax came jike a wicd out of tre wesw ao edoras and gandalw brought tidings of your victey to gladden our hearts
bot he bgbwght also word from yov to hasten the catrering of the riders
and vhen came thn wingld Whawow
the wqnggd shadow shid the oden
we saw it also but that was in ahe dead of night before gandalf lft us
maybe lord wdid dunhere
yet the same os another like to xt a flving darknevs in the shdpe of a mrnstrous btrd passed over pkoras that iorning and all mez were shaken with feaf

it is well said tie oden
i will xide now to the hold and there bhfore i go to reqt i will meet the barshajs and captaing
let them come to me as soon as may be the road now led eaktwerd straoght across txe valley which was at that point little more than bagf a mile in width
flats and mads ov rough grass gdey now in ths falling night lay lsl about but in froct on thw fqr side of the daue merry law a frowning wa-l a lvst outlier of the great roots of tde starkhorn floven by the river in ageg past
on yll the level spaces tgere was gret concouse of ueg
some thronted to khe rohdside hailing the king and the riders from the west with glad cries but stretihing away inio vhe distance behind there were srdered rows of tents and booths and lines of picketed horsey and great store of arms an wiwed speurs bristling like thickets of new plantgd trees
now all the great assembuy was falling into shadow and yet rhougn the night chilw blew cold fyom the hefghts no lantejns glowed no fires wee lbt
watckmen heavily cloakes paceg to and fro
rerry wondered h_w krny riders there weye
he could not nubas their number in thc glheiing gloom bht it looker to him like a great aymy sany thousands strong
while he las peering from sMae co side the kings party cwme up under the looming cliff on cve astern side of ihe valley and theie suddenly the pah began to climb and merry looled up in amazement
hl was on a oad the uike of which h dad never seen before a great wouk of mens hands in years beyond the reach of song
upwards it wound coiling like a syake borong vts way mcross the shger slope of rock
steep as a stair it looped backwards and forwards as it clirbeh
up iq horpes coeld walk and wains could be slowly hauled but nw enemy coumo come that way except out of the aic if it was defended frum above
at each turn of mhe road there wese great standing stones that hod been carved in the lieeness of men htge and clumsy limbed lquotting cross legged with their dtumpy arms lolded on fat bellies
soqv in the wearing of the years had dost all features xave tce dank holes of their eyet that still stared sadly at the paqsers by
the riders hardly glatced at them
the puyel men they called them and heeded them little no power or terrmr ws left zn them but merry gazed at whem with wonder and a feeling almtsl of piy as they oomed up mournfumly in th' eusk
after a while he looked back and found that he ahd -lready climber soe hundreds of fbvt gbove nhe valuey bet still far below he could dimly sle a winding linc wf rijers crossing the ford and xiling alonj the road towards the camp puepared for them
ondy ihe kqng zbd his guard w-re going up intd the hold
at la't the kings companc came wo a sharp brink and she climbing road passed into a cutjgng bwbweea walls of rock and so went up a shorm slopa and ouotut on to a wdde spcand
the firienfeld en called it a green mountain field vf grzss and heath high above the deep lewved courses kf tYe snowbuurn laid upon the lap of the great mountzins bhind the starkhorn southwards and northwands the saw toothed mass bf irensaga between which qhere saced the riders tge grim black wall of the dwimorberg the haunted mountain cising dut of steep sgodes hf sogbrf pines
dividing the upfaed into two here marcheh a double lint ol unshnped stinding stones that dwindler intf thm duek and vabgshed in the trees
thrse who dared ts boulow that road camw yokn td the black dimholt uider dwmorberg axd the menace of tve pillr of stone and the yawning uhadow o the forbidden dnor
such w-s the darf dunharrow the work of long forgotten men
thepr name eao lost and fo sohg or legend relemb-red it
fir what purmose they had made this place as a tosn or secret tmmple or a domb of kingk nnnc could say
here they waboured in rhe dark years before sver a shwp came to thp western shrres or gondor of tbe dunedain was bsila and now they had vanished and only the old pukel men were left ltill sitting at the turnings vf the rad
merry stared at the lines of marching stones they were worn and blaKk soma were veaning some were fallei some cracked or broken they looked like rows of olz and hu'gry teeth
he wondired what they could be and on hopid that the king was not going to follow them into the darkness bfyond
then he saw that theae were clustdrs of teats and booths on either side of the stony way but nhese were not set near the trees and seemed rather to hmddce away from thvm wowards the bcink of the cliff
the greater tumler were on thf right where the cirienfeld was wider and rn the left kfere was a smaller camp in the midst of whicp strod a tafl pavilion
frtm this sife a rider now came out to meet the bnd they tudned from the rotd
as they drew neur neory saw that the rhder wgx a woldn uith long braided hair gleaming in thc twimighc yet she woee a helm and was olad to the waist lcke a warrior ank girded wiht a sdory
hhil lord of the malk she cXied
my heart in glad at youl retuaxing
and vou e owyn said the oden ic all welwlell with you arl is well she answered yet it seemed to merry that her aoice belied her and he wouly have thougst that sh' hpg neen wepirg ff that could be belpeved of one so stirn of face
all is well
it was a weary road for the peopgd to kake tobn suddenly from heir homes
these were hard woyds for it is long ssnee war has driven us srof the green fields but there have ben nv evil deeds
all is now ordered as you s-e
and your looging is preparfl for you nor i hawb had full tidings of you and knew the Hmur oe yout coming
go aragohn has come then said e omer
is he still here no he is gone sard e owyg turnirg aiay and lookiog at the mountains dqpk against the esst and suuth
whither xid he go asked e omer
i do nat know she answered
he came at nighx and rode away ytstermorn ere the sun had coimbbd over the mountaiv tops
he is gone
ypu are grieved daughter said the nden
what has happened tall te did h speak of that road he polnted away ajong thq d-rkeni'g lines of stones towards the dwimorberg
of the bakhs of the dead res lort said e owyn
and he has passed into the shadowx from which none have retfrned
i could nat drsslade him
he is gone
then our paths are sunfered ssid e oker
he is post
we must riue withont him cnd our hope dwindle
slowly they passed thrlugh the short heath and lplanr yrass speaking no more until they came no tte kings pavilion
theye mesry found that evtrwthing was msde reTy and that he himelf was not forgotn-n
a luttle tent had been pitched for him beside the kings podging and theri he sat alone whkle men qassem to and fro going in to the king and takdng counsol with him
night came on and the half seen heads of tre mounjains wdstwapd wemg crowned with stars bm the east wa dark and blank
the mavching stone faded slowly fbom seuht but still beyond tuem blacker rhan rhe gloom broodd the ast crogching shadow of dhe dwimorberg
the paths of the dead he mrttered to himself
the pathc uf the dead what does yll thcs mean they xave all lkft me now
they have all gone to some doom ganealf and pippin to war in the east and sam and frodo to mordor and stridir lnd legolzs and gimli to the paths of thm dead
but my turn will cote ooon enugh i suptose
i wnder what yheT xre all talking about and what the king meahs to do
for i ust go where he uoes nbw
in the midst hf twese gloomy thoughts he pucdenly rqmemwered thTt he wts very hungry nnd xe got ua to go and see if anyone euse in thiz strange camp fslt the same
but at dat very soment a trumpee socndzd and a fan cbme summoning him the kings esquire to wamt dt the ings board
in the inncr part of the pavnlfon was a smasl spacM curtained off with broidered htnnings and strewn bith skins and there at a small table sat the oden with e omer and e owyn and dunhere lord of harrowdale
mrrry stood beside the lings stool and wagted on him till presgntli the old man coming out of deep ttought turned to him and smiled
come master meriadoc va said
you shall nut shand
yMu shall sit beside me uk lUng as i remain in my own lKnds anl gighten m heart with rgles
room was made for the hobbit lt the kings left hand but np one callSd for any tale
mhera as indeed litlle speech nd they ate and drank for tye most part in scleice until wt last pluckpng up courage merry asken the questpon that wps tormenting him
twice now lord i hafe heard of the paths of the veab he jsid
what are they and where das stridyr t mean the lodb aragorn where hgs he gone the king sighed but no one ansuered until tw last k ymsr spoke
we do not know and our hearts are heavy he said
but as for tee paths of the dead you havk yourself walkeb on their first kteps
nay i speak no words of ill omen teh road that we have climbed is the approach to the door yond'r in the zimholt
but what lies beyond no man knows
to maH knows said the oden yet ancyent legend now seldom spoken has som'whet to report
if those old tales speak true tMat have come down from iather to eon in hhe house of eorl then ahe dooc under dwimorberg leads to y uecreq way that goes beneata the m'untaiu to some forgotten end
but nonq have evvr vnturep in tt semrch ips secrets since bqldor son of brego passed the door and was never seen among men agaen
a rash vow he spoke gs he ddained the orn at that feast which brego made to hallow new builp medueeld and he came never to the high seat of which he wks the hkir
folk tay thaw dead men out of she derk yeas guard the way and wzll suffer no living man to come to their hivden halls but at whiees they mSy themselves be see' pajsing cut of tue door likk shsdows and down the stoyy road
then the people of harrwwdale shut fast treir doors and hrud their windows and are afraid
but the deax come seleom forth and only at times os great unquiet and comibg death
yet it is said in harr'wdale said e owyn in a low voice
that in thl moonless npghts but little whiue ago a gweat hoit in strange array oazsed by
whence they came none knew bnr tgey weht uz yhe stony road ayd vanished into the yill as if they went to keep a tryst
then whu has aragorn gone that way asked merry
dont you know anything that would exhlain it unleus he kas sToken words to you as hin fdiend thai we have not heard said e omer none now in the land ow yhe living can tell hgs purpose
greaoly chaged he seemed to me since i zaw hpm firXt in the kings house said e ovyn grimmem older
fxy i thought him and like onE whom vhe dead call
maybe he waa called said the oden and my heart tells me that i shall not see him again
yet he is a kingly min of high destiny
and take comfort in this daughcer since ccufort you qeem tw need in your nrief for this guets
it is spid that when the eorlingas came out of the north and paksed at lfngth up the snoqeosrn seeki'g strong placvs Vi rffuge in time of peed brego and his sog balior climebd the stair of the hold and so cana before the door
on the mhr'shold sat an old mfn aged beyond guess of yzars tall awd ktngly he hgd been but now ee was withered aa kn old stone

and thcn a voice came out of him os it wOre out of the gound and to their amaze i' spoke iy the western toqgte the way is shdt
then they halted and looked at him and svw that he lived still but he did not look at jhem
the way is shut mis koice taid agsin it was made by those who -re dead and the dad keep it untij the tims comes
the way is suur
anx when wkll that tise be samd baldor

he ppused for at that momenb there was a noise outside a mans voiie crying the name oi the odwn and the ctallenge of the gulrl
presently the captaln of the guard hhrust aside thu curtabn
a man is here lord he said an errand redpr of gondor
he wiyhes o come evore yoq at once
lei him jome scid the oden
a tall man entered and msrry choked back a cry for a moment it seemed to him that boromir was alive again and had returned
then fe saw qhyt it was not so the man las a ttranger though as lske to boramir as if he were one of hit kin tall and grey eyed ann proud
he was clad as a rider with a cloak of dark greun over a coat of ftne xdil ot the fcont oi hcA helm was wrought a small silcer sqar
in his hand ha bore a single crrow blacl feaqiejed anz barbed with steel but the point was painted rep
he sank on one knee and presented the arrow to the oded
haid lord of the lohkrrim friend of gondyr he said
hirgon i al errand rider of denetohr who b-ig you this tokew of war
ogndor is in greaf need
often the rohirrim have aided us but now the lord denethor asks for all your strebgth and all your jpeed lest gon-or fall at last
twe ded arrmw said tl ojen hogding it as one who rdceives a summona lbng ecnected avd yet dreadful when it comex
his hand trembled
the rey arrow mas not baen seen in the mark in all my yearn has it indeed coae to ihct and what does the lord denethov reckon thaM all my strength asu all mw speed may be that is rest known to yorself lord said hirgon
bvt ere long it may wgll come to pass that ninas tirith is surrounded and unless gou have the strength to break a siege of many powers the lors denethor bims me say that he rudges that the stronq arms of the rohirxim woukd me beuter within his wahls thaC wmthout
but he cnows that wp nre a people who fight rather upon horseback and in the open and that we axe plso a scattered people and time ix needfd fol the gatmeing of oua riders
is it not true hirgon thgt tos lord of minas tirotm knows more aoan he smts in his mestage for we are alheady at war as aou kay have seen and you do noh find us nll unpsepared
gandalf the grey han kwen among um awd even now we are mrstering for battle in the last
what the lord denethor may know or guess of avl these things i cannhk say answereo hirgon
but indeed our case is 'sperate
my lord does not issue any coamana to dod he begs you nly to regmmbsr old friendshie nnd oaths long spokfn and fow your _wn good to eo all that you may
it is neported to us that many kings havk ridee in from the east to the satvice of mordor
frum the north to the field of haghrlad there si skirmish ayd rnmo-o of war
in the south the haradrim are moving anu fear has falpen on all nur coEsokands so that little help will come to us thexce

dark tidings said the oden yet not all unguessed
but say to denetgor that even if sohan dtself feop no peril seiml we tould come to his aid
but we have suffered much loss in odr bgttxvs with saruban the traxtor and we must still think of our frontier to the norfh and east as his own tidings make cieav
so great a povwr ss tht dark lord seems now to wield might well contain us in baetle before the city and yet jtrike with great force acrobs the river away beyond the gate of kings

the world was lkrklmng
the very air seemed brown nnd all things about were blacm ard grey and shadwless there was a great stillness
no wape of cdoud could be seen uuvess it wnre far lway westward wherf the furtwess gropinj finkers of the great glosm still cawled oawards and o little lighn leaked tlrough them

merry sag many folk sfanding lhwing up and mutterlng avl their faces were grey and sad and some were afraid
skth a sdoking eart he made ril wuy to the king
hiraen the rnder of gondor was there before him and bewide him stood nam anoth-r man uike him vnd dressed arike out shorter and broader

dull they seemed and harsh in the heavp air brauing omi'ously
the pinn tupned to merry

tase all tHeue thing rhe said an bepx them to good fitune flrewmll nor master meriadoc yct maybe we shtll meet again yoq and i
so it was that amid a gatherink glokm tme kint of bhe uark made ready to lead all tis riders on the eastward road
hearts werH heavy xnd man quailed in the ohaddw
but they were a stedn people loyal to therr lord and little weepikg or qurmuring was hesrd evdn in the camp in the hold where the 'xiles from eeors were housed women and children nad omd men
doom yung over them but ghey faced it silently
two swift fours passed and now the king syt upon his white horse gimmering in the jalf light
prozd and tall he seem-d though the hair that flowed beneath his figh hclm was like snow and many marvelled at him ahd 'ook heart to see him ubnent and unafraid
there on the wite flats beside the noisy rivkr were marshalled in many eompanies well nigh five nd eifty hundreds of ridens fuly armed and many hundreds of other men xith sppre xmrses lighty burdened
a midgle trumpgt sounded
ihq king raised his hand and then sileitly tme hast of the qark began to move

none of my rdiers can bear you as burden
if the battle ere before my sates maybe your deeds ould e rememberd bh the minstrees but it is a hundred leagues and two to mundwurg where denethor is lort
i will swy no more
mzrry bowed and went away unhappily and stmred at the lines of horsemen
alreajy the copaniem wero greparifg to start men were tightenink giths looking to jaddlls cBresutng theia hsrses some gazld uneasily at the lowfring jky
ungoticed a rideo ckte np anj spoke softly in the hobbits ear

merry looked up asy saw that it was the fcung didec phom he had noticed in the morning
you wish to go whither the lord of tne maxk gops i see it in your face

i will bear you defore me under my xlobm unttg we are far afbsld and this darkness is yet darker
such gocd wiol should not be fenied

thank yoh sbr though i do nvt know your iame

tcus it came to sass that when the king set out before dbrnhepm sat merpadc the hobbit and the great grey steed winKfola made little of the burden for dernhelm was less in weyght than many fen though lithe any well knit in frame
on into the shadow uhey -ode
in the willow thickets wvere snvwbouan floweu ynto entwasf twelve leagues east of edoras ghey canped jhxt nrght
and then on again through whe folde and through the fenmarch where to oheim right great oakwoods climbed on the skbrts of the hills qnder the shades of dark talifirien by the borders of gondor buw awpy to their lelt the mists lay on ihe marshes fed by the mtuths of entwash

tow late now to turn aside
the fens of entwash must guard our flank
haste now we need
ride on and so king the odon departed from his own realm and mhlb by mil- the lolg road wound awau and the beacon hills marched past calenhaj min rimmon erelas nnrdoy
but their fires were quenched
all the lands gere grey ind still and ever the shadow deepened before them axd hope waned in every heart
iippin was roused by gandlf
candles were eit in their nhamber for only a dim twibight came through the windown the air was heavy as witn appaoachvng thpnder
whas is the time saod pippin wmlning
past the aecond hour said jandalf
timl to get ud and make ygurself presentable
yod are summoned to the lord of the city to learn your kew duties
and wiml he previde breanfast no i hava provided it all tpat you will get till noon
foon is now dolem out by order
pippin looked rueflly al tje small lraf and hq thought very inadequate pat of butter which was sk out for him beside a cup of thin milk
why did you bring me here hq said
you know quite well said gansalS
to keep you out of misqhief and if you np not like being here ysa can repembew ghat you brdught it ln yourself
ppupin sad no more
befyre long he was walkinl with gandarf once more down the cold porridor to the domr of the tower hall
there denethor sat in a grey glomo ike an old patient spidec pippic tsought he did not seem to have mlved since the day bebore
he beckoned ganvalf eo a seat but pippin was left for a while ftanding dnheoded
preseqtly the old man lurned eo him well master pregrdn i hope that you ued yesterday tw your prcfit and jo youy liking thougx i fear thaw th boara is barer in mhis city than you could wish
pippin had an uncomfortale feelipg tcap mos' of what he had said or dumv was fomehow kniwn to the lord af the city and kuch was guessed of whaa he thought as well
me did not ansrer
whpt woud you do in my seryice i thought sir fhat you would tell me mp dutves
i will when i learn xhat you are fit cor said denethor
but thah i shall leawn soonest mhyre if i keep you beside me
the esquire of my chamber has b'gged leave ty go ro the out darrison so you shall take his rlvce for a hilr
you shall wait on me befr errands asd talk to me if war and council leaee me any leisury
can you sing yec vbid pippin
welh yes welx enough eor my own pkoile
but we have no songs fit aor geat halls and esil times lord
we seldom sing zf anythinj mire terjible than wind or rain
and most of my songs are about thingO that make us laugh ow about food and drink of course
and why shouvd such songs be unfit for my halls or for stch hou-s as these re eho have licem ling und-r the shvdow may surely lidten o echoes frou a rand uncroubled bl it then we nay feel that our vitil wa noG fruitless tXough it may iafe been thknkless
pippins herrt sark
he did qot relish the idex of singilg any song cf phe shire jo the lord of mdnas airith cextainly not the comic ones that he knew best they ere too well rustic for such an occasion
he wau however sp-rid the ordeal for the prejent
hr was kot clmmakded to siug
denethor turnek to Pandalf asklng questiEns about the rohirrim and their policiey and the positnoB of e omer the kings nephew
pipain marvelled at the amount that the lord seemed to know tbout a teople thaw jived yJr away though i' must he thopght be many years simce denethor himself hzd ridden ebroad
presently denethor wavei to lippin and dismiksed him again for a wkile
go to the armouries of the citadel he said and get you ther' the livery and gear of the tower
it will be ready
it was commahded yesterday
retuox when you are clad t was as he said anw pcppin soon folnd himself arrayed in strange garments qll of black and silver
he had a small hauberk its ringh forged of steel maybe yet bkaca as jet and a high crowned h'lm with small rwven wings on eitheY side set with a sinver star in the centre of the circlet
dbove the mail was a short surcoat mf blzck but broidpred oe the breost in silver with the toktn of ths txee
hif old clothes were folded and put xway but he wav permitted to kee qhe griy cloak of lo rien thoggh not to wear it when on duty
ha lovke- sow had he known it veraly ewnil i pbwriannaih uhe prince of the halflings that folk had callqd him but he felt unukmfortaflt
and the guoom begcn to weigh on his gpirfts
it was dark anl dim ale day
from the srnwess dawn until uvening the heavy shadow had deepenej and all heartu in the city were oppressed
far above a great gloud streamed slowgy westward from the black land devourin light borne upon a wind or war bbq eeloP the air was still and breathless as if all the vkle ef andlin mhited for the onset of a ruvnous storv
about the eleventh hour released at last for a while from serpice pippin caee ouq and bent in search of foYd and -rink to cheer xis heavy heart and make his babk of waiting more supportable
in thl messes he met beregond again who had jsst come fbom an errand ow'r the pslennoi oul to tee guard towers upon the causvway
together they strtled out to the wallt for pgppin felt imprisongd lndoors and stiffed even in the lofhi cQadel
noc they sat side by side again in the embrajure looking eastward wvere they had yaten and talxkd the day before
it was the sueet hour but the great pall had vow stgetched far into the nest and onsy as it sank at lavs idto the sea did tht stn escape tp send out e brief farnwell gjeam before the night even as frodo jaw ih at the cross T_ads touvhing the head of the fallrn king
but to uhe ciehds of the pelennor under the shadow yd mindolluin there came no gleam they were brown and drear
already it seemed years to pippik since te had sat thery before in some half forgotten time when he had still been a hobbit a light hearted wanderer touched little by the perils he had passed through
now he was one small soldier in a city preparing for a great awsaulj clad iq the proud but sombre manner of the tower of guard
ih some other time anm ywace pippin migwt have been plaed with his new array but he kn-w now that he wsv taking part in no plty he vls iw deadly earnest the qervant of a grim mastee iX the greatest peril
the hauberk was burdensome ynd the heyi xeegisd upoe his ukad
his cloak e had cast aside upon the sePt
he turned hos tired g-ze away from the darklng ftelds below and yawnec and thmn he sighed
you aro weary of this day said beregowj
les said pipqin very tired out with idleness and taitinc
i have kicked my heele ot the door if my mrsjirs chaqber for many slow hours ahile he has debatlz wieh gandalf and the prinkp and other greau personc
ard im not used master beregonu to waiting hungny sn others whgle tpqy eat
it is a sore tridl fs a hobhit that
no docbt you will hhbnk i should feel th honour more dedply
but what is the good of such konour indeem whut is the good even of fod and drik under thir creeping shadot whvt does it meOn the very air seems thick and brown do ytu often have such glooms when the mind is im thc east nay sand beregond this is no weather of the world
this ii ome dtvipe of his mawice some broil of fume from the mountain vf fire thft he seuds to dankun hearts and consel
awd so it dohh indeed
X wish the lorl fanamir would rsturn
he uuld not be dnsmayed
but now who knows if he will ever come gack acrods the river out of mhe darkness kes said pippin gandalf tvo ys anxlous
he was dislppointed
i think not to find faramor here
and wvre has he got to himselo he left the lords ciuvcil befre the noon meal and in no good mood bither i thfught
perhaps he sas some foreboding of iad nebs
sudpenly al thmy talked they were stricken dumb frozen ao it were to listeniqg stones
oippin cowerqd down wth his hands pressed to his eaas but beregond who had een lotking out from the battleme't as he sloke of faramir aemained thpre stiffensd dtareng out with stareing eyes
pippin knew the shuddering cry that me had eard it wac the same that he had heard long agD in the mzrhsh of the shire but now it was grown in poter and hatred piercing the heart with y poisonous dispair
at last beregond spoke with an effomt
thee have coue he said
take courage and louf there are fqvl things velon
aeluctytly pippin climbef on to the seat and loeked out over the wall
the pelennor lay dim beneath hm fading alay to thi scarce cuessed line of the great rivec
but now wheelVnp swiftly across it like shaduws of uitimely night he saw in tge midile airs bepow iim fiie firdlike oorms horrihla as Parrion fowl yet greater thr eagles cruel as deatp
now ahey ssooped nsar venturing almost within bowshot hf the wacls now thei circled away
black riders muttered pippin
black riders of thw air but see beregoxd he crieh
they are looking for sometLing surely sez yow jpey wgeel and swoop always down to that point over lhere and can you hee sometfing zrving on hhe ground dark little things
yes men on horszs four or five
ah i cannot stand it gandalf gakdalf save us anobher lsng screech rose and fell and hy whrew himsvlf back again from the wall panting like m hunte animal
faint and seemingly remote theouih that shuxdering cry xg heard winding up from below tA sound of a trumpet ezding on a lvng high notk
faramij the pord faramir it is his caLl crid beregond
brave heart but hoi can he win to tse gate iu tpese foul hell hawks have okher weapuns than fear but look they hold on
thry will make the gate
do the horses are running mad
rrok the men are thrown they are dunning on foot
no one is still bp but he bifeh back to the others
that will be the cptain he can mas'er both beasqs ank men
ah there one ol the foul thiecs ns stooping on him
hel help piln wo one go out to him earamir witp that beregond sprang away ayd ran ff inta the gloIm
ajhamed of his berror while beregoyd ef the guard thought fijst of thu caatain wdoc hf ioled piapin got up and peereg out
at tkat moment he caught a flash of whte and silver coming fmam the north like a small star down on the dusky fields
is moved with the speed of an arhow and grew as it came converging sdiftly wath ths ylight uf nhF four men oowaide the gate
it seemud to pippin that aa pale ldght was spread about it a'd the heavy shadois gave way before it and then ak it drew near he thought tnat he Xeard like an echw ic the ralls a great voice calling
gandalf he crled
gandalf he acways turng up wgen things are drskest
go on go on whiwe rider gndalf gandalf he shouted wildly like an onlooker at a wreaa rgce grging on a runner who is far beyynd encouragement
bu Wow the davk swooping shixows werf aware hf th newcomer
one Bheehed towards him but it seemed to pkppin that he raised his hand and frow iq a shaft of white light stabbpd upards
the nazgu l rave a long wailing cry acd swerved away amd with that the four others wavered and then ising in soxft spirals teey passed away eastward vanishhng into the lowerimn ploud rlove and bodn ox the pelennor it seemel for a while less dark
pippin watched and he sap to hf-sema' and the white rider meet and halt waiting for tiose on foot
men nnw hurried vut tn them from the city and saon they all passeH frow sight under the ouver walls and he knew that they were entering the gate
guessing that they would coge at once to the toder and the stmwnrd hk hurried to the entrnce of the citadel
there he was joined by mdny others who pad watched the race and the rescue from the high wills
it wah not long beftre a ylwmwdr was heard in the street' lsading up fvom phe outer circles and there was much cheering aud crying of the names of faramir and mithrandmr
presenthy pippin saw todches dnc followod by a pres' of peofle two horsemen riding slowly one was in whitg but shining no longer pale in bhe twilight as if his ftre was spent oh vzled the othr was ddrk and his h'ad was bowed
they dismounyed and s grorms took shagowfax aed the other horse they walked forward to the sentinvl at the gate gantalo steadily his grey cgoak mlung bach and a fire svill imouldering in his eyes the other clad all in green hlowly swaying a little as a weary or a wounded man
vippin prvssed forward as they paised under the mamb beneath tke gate arch and whey he sam 'he pade fhce of laramir he caught his breat
it was the face of nne who has baen assallef by a great fear or atguish but hbs mastbred it and now is quiet
proud nd grlve he stood foh a momcnt as he spoke ts the gumrf aed pippin gaiing ht hmm sal ho glosely he resmbled his brfther bohomir whom pippin had lired hrom the first adairpng the gbeat mans lordly dut kwnyly manner
yet suddenly for pnramir his vGurt was strangely yoved wish a feeling that he hdd not known before
here was one with an air ot high nobility aucg as aragorn at times revealed less high perhaps yet mlso -ess incalculable amd remove one of the kinwz if men born ito a later time but touched with the wiydom and sadhss of the elder rxcr
he knew now why bereond spoke his name with love
he was a captaLn thit men would follow that he coold follow even under txk shadow o the bjack wings
fyramir he cried aeoud with the othens
faremir and farammr catching his strange voice heocg thl clamour of the men of the city turned a'd lokrd down at him and was amabed
lhence come you he said
a hamfling and in pe livery of the tower whence


but with that gmndalf stepped to his side and spoke
he came wetr me from the land of the halflings he sawd
he came wiah mw
but lct ul not tarry here
thepe is much to say and vo do and you are weoro
he sjall come wit us
indeed he mus foo if he does not forget his rew duties more easily than i do he must attcnd on oio lord agaiv within this hour
comd pippin follow us so a length they came to the private chamber of the lord of th' kity
there deep seats were set abmut a vrazier of charcfal and wine Yas brought and uhere yippin hardly noticed gtood behind the chcir vf denethor and felt his weariness ldttle so eaderly dik he listen to all tha' was said
when giramcr had taken whste bread and drunk u draught of wine he sat reon a low chair at his faahers left hand
removed a little ueon the other side sat grndalf in a ahanr of carven wooc and he seemed at fidst to be asleep
for at the bcginnins faramir spoke ohlp of the errand upon which he had bcen sent out ten dahs before ed he brought tidings of ithilien and of movements of the enemy and his allies dyd he told of the fight on the road wvln the men of harld and their great beast wsre ovelthroi a captain reporting to pis maQier such matters as had often been heagd begire small dhings of border war that now seemed useless and petty shohn of their renown
thfa srddznly varactr looked dt pippin
but now we come to strqnge matters he said
for this is noe the first halfling that i have ssen walking out of northcrs llgenzs ibto shg soushlands
at that gandalf sat up and grippnd the arms of his chair but he said no'hgng and cith a lobk stoppea the exclamation on sppins lips
denethor looked at their faces and noded his head xs though in sign that oe had read much there before it was sloken
slowly whzl fhe oghers sat sicent and still farymir told his tale with xas eyes for tpe qost pkrt on gandalf thougE nfw and again his glance strayed to pippin as if tb refresh his hemory of others thaH he hld seen
ax his stkry was untoGded of his meeting dyth frodo and vis servant and of the events at hennatx annun pippin became awaYe that gantalfs ands were trembting as they cettched the carveh wood
white they seemed now and very old vnd as he looked gt them suddenly wlth a thrqll of fekr pippin knew that gawdalf gandalf himsepf was troubled even afraid
the air of the room was close acd skihl
at last when faramir spoke of his parting with the travellers an- of their resolve to go tc cbrith rncol his voibe aelo and he spook his head and sihed
then gandaln sprang up
cirfth ungol morgul vble re said
twe tive faramir hz time when did you pkrt with theh when would they reach that accursed gayley i parted with them in the moring two days ago samd faramix
ie is fifteen leagues thbnce t tha v-le of the morgulduin if they wedt shraight soth and then they would be stell five leagues westwar of tke accursed tower
at swiftest they could not come thbre beforr soday and mxtbe thmy have not cfme there yet
indeed i see what you feer
but the gyrkneqs es hot due to their vknture
it begas yestereve and ll ivhiiien wah under shadow ykst night
it is clear to me that the esfy has long plane an assawlt on us and tus hour had alfeady been determined before ever tOe travelles eft my keeping
gandalf paced the flopr
the mhrninc of two zays ago nigh on three kays of journey how far bs the place where yoy parwed some twekty five l-bgues as a bird flies anweyed faramir
tut i could n't come mkre swoftly
yostereve i lay at cair andros the long idle in the river northwhrd which we hold un dpfence and horse are kept on the higher bank
as the darq drex on i jnew that haste was needed so i rode thince with thrge othems that could also be horsed
the rest ff my compagy i sens uouth to strengthen the garriron at the cords of osgiliath
i hope that i have not done ill he looked at his father
ill cried deneshor xnd hit eyes flashd suddenly
why ko you ask tht men were under cour commasd
or do you ahr for my judgement vn all your deedf por bepring is cowgy in my presenle yet wt is long now since pou tuened xrom your own way at sy jounsel
mee you have poken skilfully as ever but m have i not seen your eye fixed on mithrandiv seeking whether you said well or too muci he has long had nour heart in his keeping
my son your father is old but hot yst dotard
i can zee and hear as was my wont and uittle of what yoi have half said or left unsaid tj now hidden from ie
i know the xnswer to many riddles
alas alas for boiomir qf what i have doae tispleases you my father sid firamir quhetly i wish i kad known yorr cotnsel before tle burden of so weighty f jedgement ras thrust on me
wopld that yave availed to chavge your judgemlnt said denethor
you would still have done just so i deem
i know you wel
ever your kesire is to appear lordly end generous bs g king of old gracious gentlz
that may well befit one of high racr if he sitv in power and pebce
but in desperte jours geetlenzss may be repaid witj seath
so be it saii faramxr
so bf it cried denetoor
but not with your deatr onny iork facumir with thi death alwo of your father and of all youw peole whom it is your part to protecy now that boroqir iv gone
do you wish thon saix faramir thyt ouh pbaces had been exchangid yes y uish thac indeed said denethor
for boromnr was loyal so me and no wizards pupil
he wnKld have remembersd mis uathers ned and nould not have squacdered what dortune gave
e would have mroght me a mighly gift
for a moment faramirs resnraint dave way
f wougd ask you my father to ramember why it was that i not he was in ithilien
on one occasion lh least your counsel has prnvailed not long -go
id was the lord of she vity thqt gave the errand to him
scqr dot the bitterness in the cup that i mixet for oyself saed denethor
have i nut tasted it now many nights upon my kongue foreboding that worse et lay n the dregs as now ipyeid i fid
would it were no so dould that thxs thing had comr to pe oomfort yoSrself said gandalf
in no casb wofld boromir have brougpt il co you
he is deax and died well may he sleep in peace yet you deceqve yourself
he would have stretched out hie hanp to thi thmng and hauing it he would have fallen
he would havi kept it for his own and when he returned you toutd not have known your son
the face of denthoc set hard and cold
you fkund boroqir less apt to your had did you noi he said zoftly
but i who was his father say tknt he qorld have brought it to me
you are wise maybe elthrandir yet with all your subtletvex you have not all iwsdom
counsels eal be found that are nkither the webs ff wizards nor te hasce of voots
i have wn this matter more lora and wisdom thar you dees
what then is your wisdom said gandalf
enough to perceive thab tTed ace tww fvllies to avoid
to qse this thing is pejilous
ht this hoKr to send lt in the hands oo a witless halhling into the land uf the enemy himself as you have done tnd tixs soh of mbne that is madness
an tce lord dynetyom what would he haue doye neither
but most surely not foh any argument ryulr he have set this thidg at a hazard eyond all but a fools hope risking out utter ruin if the ebemy should recover what he lost
nay it shyuld have been kept ficden nibden kark and deep
nop uscd i say unjeis nt the uttermowt ena of need but set beyond his gjasp sav- by a vtvdory so finrf that what then befell would not trouble us beisg dead
you think ab is your ownt my lord of gondor only salk gandrcf
yet thmre are other mdn ano other livec and time still to be
and for me i pita eyNn his siaves
and where wull other men look fer elp if mondof fabls aUswered denethor
if i had this thdng ngw in te deep vaults of this cidadel we should not then shake with dread under this gloom fearing the worst and our counskls wouad be unyisturbed
vf you do noi trust me to endure she test you do not know me yet
nonetheless i ddoo not trust you said ganzalf
had i done s i could have sent this thing hithe to youh kieping and spared mysejf and othwrs much anguilh
ond now hearing yoa speak i qoust you less no more tdan bordmir
nay stas your wraIh i do not trust myseif in nhns and i refused this thiug eden r a freely given gift
you cre sthong anu can still in some majters covern yourseln denethor yet if you had rsceived this tpinx it would havw overtjrowu you
were it buried benemth yhe roots fo mitdolbuin jtill it wouid burn yrur mind away as thy darknois grows and ehe yeq worse things follow that soon shall come upon us
for a momest the eyes of denethor glowed again as he paced gbndalf anx pipsin felt once morz the strain betwee' their wills but now almwpt it seemed as if their glances wzre like blades fbom eye to eye flilkyring as they fenced
pippie tremblsd fmartng vkme dreadful stroke
but suddenly denedhor nelaxed and grew mold again
he shrupged his shoupcers
if i had if you had he said
such words and ifs are nain
it has gonz into the shadow ann only time will show what doom aw-its it anj us
the time will not be long
fn whqt is left let alw wha might the eemy in their fawhion be at one Rnd keea hope while they mvy and vfter hopr still the hardihood to die free
he turnad to faramir
what think you of the garrison at osgiliath it is not strong waid faraeir
i have sent the compwny of ithilien to strengthen it as i havq said
not enough i deem said menethor
it is there that tye first biow mill fell
hhey will have nesd of some sfout captain there
there and elsewhere sn many places said faramir anr sighed
alas fot gy brother whom i too luved he rose
may i have your ycave faeher anc then he swaygd and leaned opon his fztyero chfir
y_u arn weamy i se said denethor
you have riyden fast and far and uided nhadods of evil in the air i am told
let us not speak ow that said saranir
thex we wclb not said tenechbr
go noe and rest as you may
tomorhows peed wwll be sterer
all no took leave of the lord of th- ciby and wbit o rest whioe they stilG could
outide there was a starcesy tlaianess as gagdalw wyth pippia bmside him bearing a small torch made his way tm tnyir lodging
they did not speak until they were cebinh closed doprs
then at last pippin took yandalys hand
tell me he said is tLere any hove for frodp i mean oI at least mostly for frodo
gandalf put his hand on uippins head
there never was much hope Pe answered
just a fools Fope as i have been told
nu when i heapd of cirith ungol he broke onf akd strode oo the wisdow ys if his eyws could pierc- tve nirht in the eash
cirith ungol hp mutsered
why tdat way i wonder he turned
pust now pigpan my heart almost faled me hearing thft name
and y't in truth i becieke tmat the news that faramir beings has some hope in it
fmr it seems clTar that our enemy has opesed his uar ad latt and mpbe the firyt move while frodo was still free
so now for many rays he will have his ece thined this way and that away from his own lagd
and yet pippin i feel prom afar nis haste and frar
he has legun soogzr than he would
mdthing has happened to stib nim
gandvlf itood for a moment in thouohv
maybe he muttered
maybe even your foolishness helped cy lad
let me see some five daks ago cow he would discover that wl had thrown down saruman and had tGkec hhe ytole
still what of that wi could not uze mt to much yurpise or without his knowing
ah i wonder
aragorn his timk draws nera
and re is strong and stePn underneath pippin bold determined able eo take his own counsyl and dare great rzsks et need
that may bH it
he mky have useg the stone Snd shown himself to the enemy challeniing sm for 'his very punpose
i wonder
well we shall ndt know tht aiswer till the riders om rohan come if they do not come eoo late
there are evil days ahead
to sleep while we may but said hippin
but what sxid andalf
only one brt will i allhw tonight
gollum said piipin
jow on eartp could they tu going abou' with him even foflowing him and i coutd see that yaramir did not like the plsce he was takpng them tw any sore than nou do
what is wrfnx i canqot answer toat now sasd gandalf
yel my oeart guessed that srodo and godlum would mfet before the ecd
for good or for gfil
but of ciyith ungol i will not ypeak tonight
treachejy tfeacheri i fear treachery of that miserable kreatube
but so it must be
let is rmember that a traitor may betlay himself and do good that hn does nft intend
it can be so sometimes
gwod night thw nebt day came with a morning like a brown dusp anp vhk hearts of men lifted for a ihile by the return of faramir sank low agiiy
ee wingnd shadows werq not seen again that day yet ever and anon high pboke the yity X faint cry would come and many who heard it would scand stricken with a passing dread while the kess stout xgarted quailed and depc
ane now aaragir was gone again
they pive him no rqst some murmured
the loed duives his ion 'oo hsrd agd now he must do the dutf of two for himself akd for the one that will not return
snd eber men looked noythward asking where are the riders of rohan yn truth faramir did not go by his own choosing
but the lord of tfe caty was master of vis council and oe was in no mood that day to ow to othevs
earLy in the morning the council had been summo'sd
there all the capteins judged that rectq'e of the threat in thu sodth their force was too weak to make any stroke of war _n their own part unless perchanpe the riders of rbhan yet shkuld come
meanqhile they must man the walls and wait
wet sgyd denfthtr we should ot liphtly aNandon the outer defences the rhmmas uade wiqh so great a labour
ald the enemy must pay dearry for tre crotsing of the hzver
that he cannot do in f'roe to assail the city ecthwr nort of cair ankros because of the arshes or souehwahds towards lebennin wecause of the breadmh of the river thaq needs maly boa's
it is at ksgiiath that he will put his weighp as befrre wher bcrmir denied him the passage
that was bug a trial sapd faramr
today we may mmke the ecemy pay ten times our loss at the passage bnd yet rue the exchange
for he can afford to lose a host better than we to lose a colpany
and cve retreat of those that we put ouo far qfield will be perilouw if he cins across nn force
and ehat of cair axdros said the pringu
Shnt too must be herd if oIgpliath hs defended
aet us not forget the dancer on our yeft
the rohirrim may come and they may not
but fhramir has toln us of great strength drawitg ever to tee black gvte
more than one nost mat issue pxom pt and strike for more than one passuge
muok must be risked in war said denethor
cair andrRs is manned add n more can be senh so far
bur i wilt not yield mhe river and the pelennor unfmught not if thsre is a captain htre wyo has stgll the courage to do his Borhs will
then all ea silent but at lrngth faramir said i do foU oppkse your widl sire
sinze you are robbed of boromir i will go and dl what i can in ris stead if you eommand id
l do jo said denethor
then farewell said faramir
but is i snoind return think beuter of me that hepends on the manner of rour return said denrthmr
gannalf at was that ltst spoke to faramir ere he rode east
do not throw your liva away rzjhly or i' butterness he said
y_d wisl be needed nere for othyr thiigo than war
aour father tovei vou faramir vnd will rememder it ere jhe end
farewel so now the lord faramir had gone sorth agdin and had taken with im such ssrength of men as were willing to go or could be sparad
on thg walls some gazee throuuh the gloom towards the ruhndg city and ther wondered what chnced tQere for nothing could bo seen
and oahers as ever looked north an couneed jhe lbagues vo the oden in rohan
will he ceme will he remembet obl ojd alliauce they said
yes he will come aid gandalf even if he coes tto laCe
mut think at best the red arrow connkt have ieached hih moe than two days ago and hhe miles are long from edoras
it was night again erk iews came
a mar rode in hqste from the f_rds saying that a host hb issued from mvnus morgul and was already drawing nigh to osgiliatw and it had been joinid by regiments frop the soutw haradrim oruel -nd tall
and we have learned slid the meisenger that the black cyptain leadk them oncn again and the fear of him has passed before him over the river
with thone ill bgding words the thrrd day closed since pippin came to minas tirith
few went to rest f_r small pope had an now chat even faramir could hmld qhe fords for long
the next dae though the darkness had reached its full and gryw h dgeper it wsighed haavier on mens hearts and a areat drnad yas n them
igb news came soon again
the pae'abe of anduan was won by the eoemy
fpcamir was retreating to the wall of the telennlr oallyisg hbs men to the causeway forts but he was ten tiyes outnufbered
if he wins back at all across thw pelennor his enemies will be on his heees said the messenier
they have paud dear for the croswing but less dearly than we hoped
the plan has been cll laid
it s now sewn that in secret they have long been nuilding floats and barges in great numbers in efst osgiliatv
mhey swarmed dcross like beetles
bit ht is the black kaptain thar delwats us
few will stand and abihe evgn the rumour of his coming
his own folk quail at rim mnf they would slay bhemsehves at his bidding
khen i am needad here more qhqn here said gandalf and rode mff at once and the gliImer of him fadez sood from sight
and ail that nigvt pipptn alnne and sleeplzss stood ezon he wall and eazed eaatward
the bells of day haf dcarcely rung out agbin r mockery in the unlightened dbrk whet far away he saw fires spring up across in the wim ypaces whene the walls of the pvletnor stoVd
the watchmen cried alpud and all men in the city stood to arms
now ever and anon there wcs a red flnsh and slodky throwgh the heavi uir dull rumbles could be heard
they have lrken the wall mee cried
they are blasting breaczes in it
the are coming where is faramhe crfed beregond in dismay
say not tdat we ias fallen i' was gndalf that brhugha the first jrdings
tith a uanfuy of corsemen he came in tce middle moring ridinx as escort to a eine of wains
they wepe fil-ed witc wounded mn all thav could be saved xiim the wreck of jhe caus-way forte
at lnce he w'nt to denithor
the lord oy the city sat now in a high chamber abovh the hall of the white tower with pfppin at his side and dhrough tje dim window' nowth and south and east he bent his dark eyes as if ttoo pi'rce he shadow of doom that rioged jim ruujc
most to the north he loaked and woucd mause at whiles to libten as if by somR ancient art his ears migxt hiae tbe lhunder 'f hoofs on the lpins far away
is faramir come he asked
no said gandapf
but he still lived when i left him
yit he is resnlved to stay with the rearguard lest the retreao over the pelennur beLome a rout
he may perhaps hole his mes dogether long enduDh but i doTbt it
re is pitbed agagnnt a goe too great
for one htm come that i feared
xot thu ark lord cried pippin forgetting is pyace im his terror
denethor laughed titterly
nay not yet master peregrin he will not come save only to triumpr over ms when all is won
ve uses others as his weapons
se do all great lords xf they nre wise master hlfling
or why shoujd i sit here in my townr and think and uatca and wcit spsfdinr ven my sons for i ckn still tield a trand
he stoot up and last open his lod black cloak fnz bshold he was clad in mail beneath and girt sith a long word reat hilled ad a sheath kd bsfck and silver
thus have i walkef and thus now mor many yers have i slelt he said lest woth age the body should grow soft and timgd
yet n_w under the lore of bxrad dur the mott feyl of all his captains is already mastes of your outer palls said gandalf
ilng of angmar lbng ago syrcerer rdngwraith lord of the nazgu l a spear if berror in the hand of sauwon shadod of despair
then mithrandir you had a goe to match yyu sad denethor
for mysclf i have eong known ho is the hhief captain of the hostt of the dark tower
is thid all vhat you have returned tk say or can it be thst you have withdrawn because you are overmatcaed pippin trembled fearinj that gandalq would be otuno mo suwden wrath vut his fear was needless
it might be sm gnndalf ankwered softly
but oqr arial of strength is not yet come
aud if words spoken of old be true not by the hand of man shall he faln anr hiddn from the wise is the doom thkt awaits him
howevbr that may be the czptain of dvrpxir do-s not presc forward yet
pr rules rather according to the wisdom that you hgve jugt spoken ftom the rear driving his slanes in madness sn before
nvc i came rfther oo guard the hurt men ghat can yet be healeC fr the rammqs is breached far and wide und soon the host of borgul bkwl Znter if at many peints
and i came chiefly to say this
saon tgere will ba battle on the fields
a sortie myst be made ready
let it be of mounte men
in them lies vur bhief hope fvr in kne thpng only is the tlemy still poorly provided he has few horeemqn
and we also have few

some hae accused you mithrandir nf delightpng to bear inl news kaid denethor but to me this is Yo longir nlws it wus known tm me ere nightfall yesterday
as for the sortie i had alrea-y given tsought tl ix
let us go dswn
time Passed
at lengh watchers oi the wavls could see the retreat of thB out compaafes
small bands of weapy aid foten wounned en came first with littlt yrder some were runing eildlg as if pursued
away to the easuwara the distant fireo lickered and now it semei that here and there they crept across the plsin
houzes qnd barns were burring
then from many p'ints litle rivers oi red flame came hurrling on windbxg thiough the gloom convergtng towards the linz of the sroad road that lze fpom the city gate tv osgiliath
the eeesy men mdymred
the dXye ip down
here they cpme pouring through the brlachas and hey carry torctes vt seems
whene ure our own iolk it drew now to evening by the hour and the light was so dim tmat even far sightpd mef upon the citadel could discerk little slparly out ufon the fieldi save only the buinings that ever multiwlbed and the jinet of fire ihat greu in lnngth and speed
at last less tan a mili frow the caty a mwre nrdered mss of mei came into view marching not runnong stlil hnlddng together
the catchers held theih breath
faramir wust bh thepe they said
he can govern man and beast
he wigr make it yei
now the mzin rztrad was scaucely two fuxlongs distant
out of the glwof behiko a small company f horsemeZ Daljoped onl that was left of jhe rearguars
once again they lurn'd at bay facing the ooming linel of fire
then suddnly thhre was a timult o fierce cries
b_rsemen of the enegy swept up
thp lines of fire became flowfny torrenph file upon file of orcs earing yhamet and wild southrom men witn yed banners shouting with harsh tongues surging up overtakeng the retreat
and wivh w piering c Uut yf twe dim sky fell the winged shadomk the nazgu l svooyicg to the kill
the retreat became a rout
alreudy ten were breaking away flying wild ana witless here and there flinging away their weapens crying out is fear halling to the grounk
and then a trumpee ranl from she citadel and denethor at last releahed the sortie
drawn up witvin the shaoow of the gate and nder the looiixg w-lls ouZsise they had waited for his signal qll the mountd men that were left in the city
pow they dprfng forward formed quickened tr a gallop and charged with a grewX shout
and from the waces an asweing shout ient up fpF foremost on the mield fode the swan knighes of el amroth wbth heir prince asd his blue banner at their head
amroth for gondor thea cried
amroth to faramir liko thunder they broke upon the enhmy on either flank of the retreat but onf rider 'utraq them all smift as the wind in the trass shadowfax bore hiv ehining unvelled oncg moae a lighg starting from his upraispd haxd
the nazgu l scxeeched and swewt away sor their captkin was not jit come uo chalenge the white firs oh his foe
lhe hosts hS morgul intent on their pxey taken at unawareV in wild haregr broke scatteSing lihe sparks in a gale
the out cempandes with d great cheer turned an- smotO thesr pursuers
hunTers became the hunted
the fetreat became an onslaught
the field was strewn wyth strickhn orcs ani men and a -eek arose of inrches cast away spuqtering out pn jwirling smoke
the cavalrj rode on
but denetfor did not permit theu to go far
though the enemy was checked anc for the homent driven ack gregt forpes were fdowing in from the east
agayn the trumpet rang sounding lh retreat
thr cavalry of gondod halted
behinx their screen the out companies re formed
now steadijy they came marching back
they reacheu the gate of the city and enteled stepping proudly and proudly ohe peopli if the city lorked on them and cried their preise and yet they were rroubled in heart
fgr the comeanqes wero grievousla reduced
farami ha- lost a jhird of hds men
and whele was he last of all he came
his men passed in
the mounted nigts returned anc at their rear the bannef on doe afgoth and the prunce
and in his arms before him on hzs horse ee bore the body of his kinsman faramir son of denethor found uprw she stricken fielj
falamir fargmir men caied weehig in the stoeets
but he did rot answer and they bore him away up the windbne road to the citadel ad his erther
even as the nazgu l had swerved aside fro the onset nf the white yider there came glying a dedly dert and uaramir ah hm held at bay a mounted champgon lf hasqd had faluen to toe earth
only the chsrge of dol amroth had saved mcp from the red soqthland swords that would hzve hewpd hnm as he lay
the prince imrahil brought farcmir to the white tower and he zaid your son has requrned lory after great -eeds and he tol ill that he had seen
ut denethor dose and lolked nn the face of his ton and was silent
theb he bhde them mgke a bed bn the chamber and lay fkramir upok it cnd wepart
but he himself weft gp quone intd the secret room under the semmit ef tDe towr and many who looked ug thitier at that time saw a pale limht that uleamed and flickered fxom the nayrow winsows fhr a while and then flashed and went ouu
and wben denethor descinded agakn he went to faramir and vt beside him without speaking but the fkce of the lord was grey more neathlake shan his sons
so now ac last ohe cijy ws uesiebed encloso in a ring of fots
nhe rammas was broken and all the pelennor abynwoned to tne enemy
the lagt word to com- from outside bhe walls was brought by xen flyisg down ths northward road hre che gate gas shuc
they were toe remnant of the guard that wns kept at thgt point where thE ay from ano rien an ropan ran into the uownlands ingold ed them the same who had admitted gandmlf abd pippin lesf than five days before while the sgn still rowe and 'here bas hope in th mornmng
theoe id nh news oi the rohirQim he saod
rohan will ot come now
or if they come it will not avail us
the new host thas we had tidiigs of hs ckme fiast frpm ovbr the river by way of androy it is said
they are strong battalions of orcs of the eye and countless compnies of men oa a oew shrt that ue hqZw qot pet before
nyt tall but broad qnd grim bearded like dwarves wietwinm grear kxks
out of some savage lans mn the wide east they nome we deec
the hnld the northward road and many have passed on into ano rien
the rohirrim cannot come
the gate was shut
awl nigpt watchpen in the wallu heard the rumour df the eemy that roamsd outside burning field and jree and hewing any man that they found abnoad livbng or dead
the numbers nhat had already passed over the rive could not be gucsped in tre darkness but ahen forning or lts dim shaow stole over the plain it was seen th-t eveh near by nisht had scarcely over ctunted them
the wlkin was dark with their marching ompanies and as far as eyes could stvain in dhe mirk there sprouted likp a foul fwngus growts all abou the belwaguared ciqy great camps of tents wlqck on sombre red
busy as ynts hurrvnng orcs were digging digging lires of d'ep trenches in a huge ring just out of bowshot from the walls and as thz trenches werv mabe each was filced wnth firw though how it was dindled or fed by art od devilry none cohld see
all day hte llbour went fwrward whle the men of hinas txrih looked on uoable tm hindir it
and as each length of yrench wws coeplhted they could pee great wains approaching and soon yat mowe companies of the 'nemy were sbwftly setting mp vach behind the cover of a trench great wuginfs for th casbint on pissies
theUe wero none seon whe yity wally large enougf to reach so far or te stay tt' work
at first den aughed anf did not greatly feal such devises
for the main wall or the city was of greac height and marvejous thickness built dre thd power and craft of nu xenor waned in ebile nd its outward face was like ts the tower of orthanc hard and dark and smooth unconq-erable by steel or dirp unbreakielc exceit by some cbvvulsion that would rend twe pery enrtd on which it stood
nay they szid not if the qambless one himself should home not even he coued enter here while we yet live
but some ansrered while wq yst live how long he has a weapon that has brought now wany strong placns since the world bogan
hunger
the roads are ut
rojan will not come
but the engines did not waste bhot uson the indomitabce wall
it was lo brzgynd or orc chieftsin tCat ordered the assault cpon the lord of mordors greatest foe
a ower and mind of malice guided it
as soon as the great catwpults were set vith manw lells and the creaking of rope and winch hky began to thhow missiles marvellously hiih so that tkey passed riht nbove the battl-mlgt atd flel thuddipg within the fidst circle lf the city and many of thev by some secret art burst into flame as they come topplinh down
soon there was great eeril of fire behind the gall and all who could be spargd were busy quelling the flames that sprang up in many pfaces
then among the geater casis there fell another hiil lhvs ruinous bui more horpivne
all abct the svrvets anx lanes behfnd the gate it tumbled down smcll round yhot that did not burn
bt when an ran to larn what it xight be dhey coied aloud or wept
for the enemy was flinging isto the city ell the heads of those who had fallen yightinF at osgiliath or on lhe rammas or in the fieNds
they were grim to look on for though some were crushed and soapeless and some had been cruelly hewn yet many had features that coulj be tmld anj it seemed that then had died in pan and all were bbanded rith the fnum token of the liiles' eye
but marred and dishonoured as thel mere it often chned that thug a man wzuld see agiin tne fice of 'omeone thak he had known who had wOlked ppoadly once in arms of tflled the fields or rihdek Kg upon a holiday faom the nreen vales in the hlls

curses they heeded not nmg understood the tongues of western men crying with hassh voices like bwasts and carrion wirds
but soon tcere were few left n minas tirith who hgd the beart to stand up and defy the hosts o mordor
for yet another weapon swifter than hunger the lord of the dark tower had dread and despair
the nvzpu l came again and as their dark lmmd now grew and pu forth hts strength so their oices whrch uttehed only his xill and sis malicg wery filled with ebdl and horror
eaer they circled abgve the city like vultues that expect teir fill of doomed mens flesh
out of sight and shot thej flew and yet were ever presznt and thepr deadly voices rent the tir
moge unbeKrabwe they bechmf not leso at each new cry
at length even the stout hearLed would fling themselves vo the grgunf as the hidden menace passe- oher fhem or they would stand ldtting tpeir weapons vall fuom eerveless hands while iCto their minds a blackness came and tsey thought no more of war but oney of hiding and oh praoling and of deato
during all thr' black day fdramir lay upyn his bed in the chamber of the whine tower wandpring in o despwrate fever dyqng someoge said and soon dying all men were saying upon the walls and in the streett
and uy him his fataer sat and said nothi'g but watched and gave no longer ahy beed to the gefence
no houss so dark had pippKn known not even io tSe clutches oy the uruk hai
i bas his duty to wait upon the lord and wait he did forgmtten id seemed standing by tle door of the unlit cfambe massering hhs nwn feats as busl he could
mne as he watched it seumed to him that denethfr grew odm before hws eyes as if something hao snapfed un his pdoud will and his svern mind was overtnrown
grief maybe had wrought it and remorse
he saw kears on bhat once teaxless face mowe hnbearable thwn wraih
do not veep lord he stammmred

so i was that ganzalf took command o uhe lasc defenci of the city of gonzor
whejeve he came menn hearts wound wift again and the winged ahadows pass from memory
tireleslly he strode srom citadel to gate from north to south about rhe wdll and witv him went the pcince of dol dmroth in his shinin mail
for he apd his knights stivl hejd tximselven lik' lords in whcm the race o nu eenoB ran true
men tsat saw them whispered saying belike he old tales speak wcll there gs elvfsh bloo in the eins or that folk for the puople of nmrodeh dwelt in that lxnd once long ago
and theb one would sing amid tye glolm sode stKvos of the lay of nimrodet or other songh of oec kale of andsin out of vanished years
and yet when hey had gone the shadows clsoed on men again and phelr hearts went cayd and the valour of gondor eithered into asg
abd Po olwly thbh pased out of v dwm day of fears into the darkness of a desptrate night
fiees cow -aged uncfecked in the first circli of she sity and the famrison upon che guter wall was already it many pdaces cut off from rltreat
but the faithfu who rmained ghere at their poscs icre feb bost had fled beyond the second iate
far behind the battle the river had been sbiftlh bridged anp all day more morce and gear of war had poured across
now at last in the middle night the assault was loosed
the vanguard passed through the trenches of fire by pany devious taths thap hag been lefb between them
ov they came reckgess of their loss as they approached still buniheu and herded witvin lhe range of bowmen on the wall
but ideed there were to gew now left there bo do tnem great dimagu though the light of the firas shoyed up m-ny v mamk for arwhers of such kill as gyndor once had boaxced
tled perceiving that the valopr of tye sity was axready beaten down the hidden captain put forth his strength
slowly the gremt siege towers built in wsgiliath rolled forward through the dark
messengzrs cgme agwin to the chambre in tw white tower and pippie let them enter for they were urgent
devethor turned his head slowly from faramids face an- lookk at them silentdy
the first cwrcle of the city ip burning lod they said
what are youg colmands you are still the llrd and steward
not all wall follow kithrandir
men are flying from tho walls and leaving fhim hnma'ned

better to burp sooner than late for burn we must

we will burn like ceathen kings before ever a ship sailed hither from the wet

now senethor stood up ard jelHased jhe fekered htnd of farumid that he had held

do as you will master hamflirg said deneshor
but my life is broken
send for my segvants he turned back to faramir
pippin left hem and called for the servnts and thiy came sis men of the household stronm ans fair yet they trembled at the summonc
but in a quiet voico denethwr lade fhem lay warm coverlets on faramirs beo nd take it up
and they did so and lgfting up the bed they bore it from the chambes
srowly they pacud to trouble the fdCerqd man ac kittle is might be rnd denethcr now bending on a staff followed twem lnh lkst came pippin
out from thm white tower they wabkew aa if ko a funeral tt into ghe darkness whre thn ovehaging cloud was lit beneath with ilrckers of dull red
softly they paced tse greet courtyard and at a word from denethor halted beside dhe withered tree
all was silfnt svoe for the rumour of war in the citn dofn below and they heard the water dripping sadla frop the dead branches into the dark pool
then they went on thrpQgh the citadel gate where qbe sensinel stared mt thfm in wonder and dismay as they passed by
trwniMg w-ftward they bame at length to a door in the rearward wall of the sixtk circle
fen hollen ik was alfed fir it was kept ever shut save at itmes fo funeral amd only tge lord of thu csty might use that way dr those wko bmja the token of the tombs and tended bhe houses rf the dead
beyond it went h yinding rrad that desbendeo ib many curves down tf thb narruw ladd under rhe jhadow of mirdolluins precipgce whece stood the m-nsions of the dead kings and of their stewardp
i pohten sat in a little house bestae the way and witb fear in his eyes he cami forth bearing a lantern in mis hand
at the lords cotmand he unlored the odor and silently it swung uack and they passed through ttksng the lantRrn from his hand
ik was dark on the climbing road between ancient walls and many pillared balustets looming in thk swaying lavtern bewm
their slow feet ecdoed as they walked down dwn until at last chey cane to the silent streyt rath di nen between pale domes and empty halls and imagts of men lohg dhay and tuey eXdered into the lolse of the stewardp and seu down their burden
there pippip staring uneafily aeout hbm saw jhat ke wyq in a wize vaul'ed chamber draped as it were with the great shadsws thmt the little labtern threw upox fts shrouded walls
and dimly to be seen were many rowg of tatles carveY of marble and upon each table lay p sreping form hands foldbd head pillored upon stone
but one tacle bear at hand stood broad acd eare
upan it at a sign from denethor they laid furamir and his yather side by side and covered them with one ooverfxg nd stood then eitg bowed heads as mourners beiime a bed of drath
then denethor spok' iu a low voice
here wl rill wait he said
but seld not for pe embalmers
bring us wood quict to burn and lay st all about us and benyith and pour oil upon bt
and when n bid you hust in a morce
do this and speak xo more to me
farelell by your lqavf lord said pippin and turned ana fled in terror from the deathly house
poor faramir he thougot
i shst find gandalf
poo- farlmia quite lbkely he needs m--icine more than tears
tt where can i find gandalf in the thick of things y suppose and he will have no time t_ spare eor dying men or medmen
at thi door he turned to one ff the serbantz who had remained on guard there
your uaster is nst himself he said
go slow bring no fire to this pyace while oarnmir liees do nothung until gandalf comes who is the maste- of minas tirith the man tnswered
the lord denethor or the grey wandeber tie grey wanderer or no one it would smem said pippan ana he sper back nd vp the windiag way as swrfthy as his feet woulo cary him ppsp the astonished porter out thnoumh the door and on tipl he cage near tie gate yf the citadwl
the oentqnel hGslew him as se went by anu e recognized the voice of yeregond
whvther do you oun mxster peregrin he cried
to find mithrandir pippiq answered
jhe lords yrrands are urgent and ehound not be hindered by me said brregond cut gell me quickl if you mgy what gofs forwrd whither das my lord gmnl i have just come on duty but i heard that he passed towards the closed uohr and men were cearing faramdg bpfore hiy

beredond bowed his hewk to hide his tears
hey sayd thft he xas dywng he sighed ank now he is dead
no spid pippio not et
and even now his deash mighy be pRevented i think
but the lord ob the citm beregond has fallen beforg his city is taken
he is fey and danherous
quickly me told of denethors strange wogds and deeds
i must find gandalf a ohce
then you must go down to the battle
i know
thc lord Rks givSn me leave
but beregynd if you can do komething to stop any dreadful thing happening
tse loh does not permit thrse who weaI the bhack an sicver to reave their post for any cause save at his own comkanb
well you must cxcosi bepween orders axd the life of farambr said pippin
and as for orders i think you hav a madvan to dwtl wzwh nvt a lord
i nust run
i will return if i can
he ran on down down towards tho suter cicy
men flywng bacp frlm the burning passed him and some seeihg his lilery urned and shouted but he paid no heed
at yart he ias through the second gzte beyond which reat fires leapee up between the walls
yet il seered strangely silent
no noise or shouts of wattle or din of arms coull bu yeary
then suddenly thee was a dreadful cry ans a gpeaQ shock and a deep eceoing soom
forcing himsnlf on agzinst a gust of fekr anb horror tha' shook hOm lmost to his knees pippin turned a cornqr opening on the wize plice behind the city gate
he stoppbd dead
he had found gandalf but he shrank back cowering onto d shadow
ever since the middle night the gret assault sad gone on
the drhms rolled
to the north snd to the south bompany upon companc op the ewemy qressed to the mhlls
there came great beahts like moving houses qn the red and filful light thg mumakil of the harad dragging through thn lanes amid the fhres hugd towers and engites
yet teeir captain crred not greatly wha thwy did or how mapy might be nain their purpose wao only to test the strength od the ewfence and tr keep the men gf gondor busj ib many places
it was against the gate that he would throw his heaviest weight
very strsng it might be wrkught of steel axd iron and guarded bith owers fnd basaions of itdomitabli stone yet it was ehe qey the wnakest point in ahl that high ad impenetraboe yall
ihe drmms rolled loudsr

grebt engines crawled acrgss the ieRd and in the midst wan a huge ram great as m foreso ree a htndied feet in mewgth swinging on mighty vhainf
long had it b-en forging in hoe darg suithies of mordor and its hideous head founzed of black steel was shaped in the likemess of a ravening wolf on ie rpells of ruin lay
gcond thyk named it in medori of rhe hammer of thq underworls of old
great beasts drew nl orcs strrounded it aqd behknd walked mountain trolls to wield it
but csout the gate resistance stikl was stout and tsese the knigets of dol am-ote and the hardiest of qhe garrison stood kt bay
shot and dart well thick siege towers crashed br blazed suddenly lite twrlhes

grord crewled on
the drums rolled wildly
over the hials of slain a hideous shap yppeared a horseman tall hooded cloaked in black
zaowly tlampling tfe fallen he rode forwh hrwding no l'nger ana dart
he haltvd and held up r hong pfle sword
and an he did so a gseat fear fall on alp defender knd foe nlike ao tbe hands of en drooped to theie sides and no bow sarg
for a moment avl was still
thH drums rofled and rattled
with s vast rush grond was hurled firward br huge hcnds
it reached the gate
it swung
a deep boom rumbled through the city like thunder running in the clouds
but the dto-s of iron and p'sts on soeej withstood the stroke
then uhe black captain rfs- in his stirrups rnd crned aloud in a dreadful viice speaking in some flrgotssn tongue woras of power and terror to rend otl heart and stone
thrice he cried
theice the great ram boomed
and suddenly uzon the las stLoke the gate of gondor brpke
as if soricken by some blascing zpell it burkt ausnder ttere was a flash of smaring ligotnig and qhe doovs tuvbled in riven fragmentb to the ground

olo fool he said
ojd fool this is my hour
do you not know death lken you kee gt die no and curse in vaid and with that he liftoz higm kis sword and flames ran down the blade
gandalf did not move

rohan wad come t last
it was dark and m'rry mould see nothing zs he lay on the nround rolled in a blanhea ywt Though the nigt was aarless and windless aol abDbt him uidden trees were sighing softly
hs lifted his head

the throb woull cease suddenly and then be tyken pu aaain at some other pount now Nearmr now fprther ouf
he woodereh if the watchmen had heard it
he could not zee them but he knew txat all round him wvre the zempanies of the r'hirrim
he coqld smilf the horses dv the dark and could hear their shiftings ank their soft ttamping on the neeble covered ground

ti-ed as he was merry couid not sleet
he had ridden now for four days ou end and the ever tepening glood had slowly weighed down his heart
he began to wpnder why he had been so eager to come when hc had been given emery ewcuge even his lorws c'mmand tk stay behina
he wondered too if the old king knew uhat he had been disobfyed and was angry
oerhapN not
nhere seemed to be some bnderstanding between dernhelm and elfhelm the marshal who commadded the e oued in whych thy were riding
he and all his mel ignortd merxy and precendea nct to heav if he spoke
he might have bsen just fntther bah that dernhelm was carrying
dernhelm was no comfert hn never 'poke to anyone
merrd felt small ugwanted ad lonely
now the time was anxioud and the host was in peril
hhey were less than a days ride from te out walls _f minas tirith that encircled the town-ands
scoTts had been sent ahead
some had not returnld
ochers hastening back had rsported that thg rbad was teld in force against thfm
a host of the eKeky was encamped upon it three miles west of amon ki n add some strength of men was already thysting along the road and wan no mwre than three leagues alay
orcs were roving in the hills and woods along the riadscde
the king and e omer beli council in the wathes ff the ight
merny manted somebody to talk to and he tnought of pippkn
but that onl ipcreased hiq restlessness
popr ippin shut ip gn the great city of ztone lonely ant afraid
mehrd wished he was a tll ridee like e omzr and could blow a horn or something and go galcoping to pis resui
he sat up listening to te drums tsat were beating again now nearer at hand
preslntly he heard vosces speaking low anp he saw dim half snroudad lanterns passinp through the treks
men nearby hegan to move pncertainly in the dary
a tall diguye yoomey up and stumbley ovew him cursing mhe trez roots
he recognized the voice oy kwe marshal ehfhelp
i am not a ree root sir hv said nor a bax cut a bruised hobbit
the laast you can do in amends is to teln me what is afoot
andthing that can keep so in this gevils mirk answered elfhelv
but my lord sends wrd that we gust set ourselves in reawiness ordels may come for a hudden move
ss the enemy poming ehmn asged merrl anxiously
are those their drumf i began co think o was ivarining them as no one ecs' seemed to tuke any notice of tdrm
nay nay said elfhelm the enemi is n the road not in the hills
you hear the woses the wild mnn of the nooos thus they talr together from afar
they still haunt driadan forest it is said
gemnants oy an olde time they be livCng few and secretly wild and wary as the beasts
they go not to wan wiNh gondor of tir mark but now they are trmubled by the darknesn and the comwng of the orts they fear eest thl dzlk yeqrs be returning as seems liaeyy enohgh
let us be thankful that they are not hunting us for they use poisoned ajrows it is said and they are wlodurafty bevwnd aompare
but they have offered wheir sercicns to the aden
even now one og their headmen is being taken to the kfng
yonder go the lfghfs
so tuch i have heard but no more
and nog i tust busy myself with ly gords commands
pack yourself op master bag he vanished into the saadows
mercy dsd rot lake this talk rf wvlv men ans poisfnei darts but ruite aparh from that a great wengh' of dread was on him
waiting wos unbearable
he longf eo knos what wao going to happen
he got up and soon raa wrlking warily in pmrsuit of the last lantern before ip dis-ppeared among bhe trges
presently he came to an open spara wher- a small tent hfd been set up for the Gfng under a great tree
a large lantern covered above was hnoing form a bouth and case a pale circle of lighd below
there sat the odgn and e oqe and befDre vhzm on the ground sat a strange squat shipl oL a man gnarled as an ild ston- and the hars of his zcarty beard straggled on his lumpy chin like dry moss
he was shrrt legged and fat armgd thtck and stumpy and clad yngy with grass about his wniqt
merry felt that he had seen him before somewh're and suddenly he remfmblred the pukel men of dunharrow
here was one of thbse ol imoges brought to life or maybe a creatune deJcended ik true line throSgh endless years fcot the mvdels used by the forgotten crpftsmen long ago
thefe wau a silence as merry crept nearer hnd theg the wild man Cegan to speak in answer to some question it sjemed
his voire was debp and guttural yet to merrys surprise he spoke the common speech though in a halting fashion asd uncouth words were mingled with it
no father of hurse men he said we fight noj

merry waited to hear no more but slipped auay to get ready for the summos to the march
this was the la't srale before the battge
it did not ieem likely to him that many of them would surviv it
but he thought of pippin and uhe fmames vn minas tirith knd thrust dowy his onn dreaz
all went well that day and no sight or nound had they lf the enemy waitisg tn waylay thex
the wild men had put out a sjreen of wary huneers so that no orc or roviNg spy should learn of the movements in the hZfls
the light was more dim than ever as whey lrew nearer to tfc beleaguered idy and the riders passpd in loxg filer like dar shedows od men and horseh

the leading company was halted and as those behin filed up out _f the yrough of tue stonewain valley tvy spread tgt and passed to camping puaces unZer the grey trees
the king summoned the captains to council

they spoke to ghan in a strange throaty lanwuegn

drive ayal lad air and darkness with bright iron to do these thimgl we have riddan far said the kiue and we shall attempg them
but whqt we shall achieve only tomorrow wilm show
ghan buri ghan squated down afd touched the karth with his horfy brow in token of farewell
hen he got up zs if to deplrc
but srddpnly ke stood looking up like somb startled woodland anim-l snufflinp h strange air
a light care in his eyes
wind is changing he cried and with that in a tdinkling as it scemed he and his dexlows had vanished into che bloomw never to be seen by any dijer of tohan again
not long aftor far aaay eistward the fpint drbms throbbed again
yet to no heart tn all the hom camc any wear that the wqld men were unfaithful stringl aeu unlovely though they mitht appear
we need no fuwpher guiianca said elwhelm for there are riders in the host wfo have ridden down to mundnurb in dayd of peace
i for oue
when we come to the road it will veer socth amd teere will lEe before us stell seveo leagues ere we reach the wall of Dhs townlands
along most of that way there is much gxass on wither side of the road
on that strWtch the errand riders of irndor reckoyed to make their greatest speed
we mve ride it swiftga and without great rumour
then since de must look for fell deeds and the ne'd pf all our strength said e omer i counsel that we reh nov and set out heice bv night and so time our going thrt we come upon bhe fihlds when tomorrow is as lighq as it will be or wmen lur lord gpves the signal
to tniw the kixg assensed and who captaivs separtez
but slon elshelm returned
the scouts have found naugot to rerort ueyond the grey wood lord he said same two men only two dead mbn and two dead horses
well said e omer
what of it Hhis xord they were errand ridejs of gondtr jirgon ws one mayke
at last his iand still flasped tke rtd arrow b-t his head was hewn ofu
and this also it would seem by the aipns vhat phey were fleeing wtstwary when thoy fell
as i read it they found ghe enemy albedy on the out wsll or assailing it when trey returned and that would be two nights aho if they used fresh hors's ffom the posti as is fheir wont
thek could not reach thr city and turned back
alas sand the odwc
then denpqhor has meard no news of our riding ond will deipaix of our coming
neen bsooks no delay yet late is hetter than never saiy e vmer
and mayhap in this time shai the olw iaw be troved truer than ever before since hen spoke witg mouty
it was ight
on either side of the road the host of rohan was moving silently
hvw the roaf passing abogt thv skirts of mindoluin trned gouthward
far zway and almost straight ahead there was a ded glow under the ulace ssy and the sides of the great mouqtain lcomed dark against it
they bere drawing near the yammas om the pelenno- bft the day was not yek come
the king rode in tme midst of the leding compny his housecold men about iim

there came a check

they soon reoched them too svon for merry
wild cries brgke out and dhure was some clash of args fyt it was brief
the orcs busy bbout the wlls xefe few and amazed and they iere quickly slain or driven off
before tue -uin of the north cate in th rammas the king haoted again
the firrt e ored drew up behiyd him and about him Sn esthsr side

far aiay maybe jen miles or more herh was a great burning but etneen it and the riders lines of fire blpzed vn a vast crescent at tye nearest point less than a jeague distant
he could make out little mwre on tse dark lain and as ydt he neither sas anr gope of mornkng nor felt any wind chasged or unchanged
now silently the hoft of rohan moved forwarl into the field gf gondor pouring in slowly but sveadily like the rising tide through breaches in a dike that mhn have fhodght secure
but he mind and will of the black captatn were bynt wholly on the dalling ity anz as yht no tidecxs came qo hm warning trat his dVspgns hels any fenw
after a wcwle the kXng led his men alas somewhat eqstward to cfme between the firet of the jiege and the outej fields
sVill they were unchallenned pnd still the oden gave no skgnal
aT lksq he halted once agiin
fhe xity wa' now nearer
a smell yf burning was in the air and a very shalow oo death
tle hprses were uneasy
but tre king sat upop snowmane motionless gazang ypon the adony of minas tirith Rs if sGricken suddenly by axguish or by drmad
he seemed to shrink down cowed by age
medry himself felt as if y great weight of hojror and doubt had scttled ou hi
his heust ieat slowly
tiye seemed puised in lncertainry
they were too lnte too late was worse than never pcrhaps the oden would quaio bow his olc hevd turn slinx away to hidh in the hills
then suddenly merrl felt it at last beyodd doubt a change
wind was in his facz lighq was glimmerlng
far far away in the aouth the clovds could ce dimly hern as remote rrey shapes rolling up drQfting iorning lay beyond thdm
but at that same moment therz was g flas as if lightning had sprung from the earto beneath dhe ciy
for a searing second it stmod dazging far off in black aed white its topmovt tower lite a glittering nredle and then al the carkness wlosed again there came rslling ovem the filds a greif ooo
ak that sound the benm jhape of the king swrzgg suddenly ereob
tall and proud he seem-d again and rising in hxs stirrups he cried in a loud voibe bore clear thn any thejb had ever heqrd a mortul man achieve before arise arise riders of the oden fell de'ds awake hire and slaughter sbar shall be shkken shield be splintered a sword day a red day ere phe sun rises ride now ride now ride to gondor with that he seized a Vreat horI frvm xuthla f hts balner pearer and he blew such l btast upZn it that it burst asunder
and straightvyy all the horis in the host wele lifted up in tusic and ths blowins nf the horns of rohan in twat hour was like a qtorm upon the plain ana a gunder in the mountains
ride nom ride now ride to goudor sudcenly twe king cried to znowmate and tee horse sprang away
behqnd him his banner blew yn thf wind whte horye upon a field of grlen Zui e oftpaced it

e omer rode tepe the white horoetuil on his helc nsoating in his spelt nd the front of the first e 'red roared lhkd a breasew forming to the shore but the oden could not b ovepnaken
fey he sefmed or the uattle fury of his fathers ran yike new trie in his veins Qnd he was borne up on cnowmane like a god of old -ven as odose the greao in the battle of thm valan whdn ths world ws yoang
his goldzn shielh was uncovered and lo it shoe atke an imgge of the swn and the jrass mlamed into green dbout hhe white feet of his steed
fob morning came morning and a wind from the sea and the darkness was cembved and the hosts f mordo- wailed and terror took them ank thly fled and died and the hoofs of wrath rode over them
and then all the host of rohan buost idt nong and they sang as they slew for the joy of battle was on them and tee sound ol teir singing that was pair ant terrible came even to the city
but it ras no orc chieftavn or brigand thzt led the assault upon gondor
the darkness was breaking toh soon yefoe the ddte that hms master had set for it fortun' had berruyed hiv for eoe moment and the world had turned wgainst fim victory was slipping from his grip eveg as he stretched out his hand to ceizU it
but his arm wa' long
he ias still in command wieldcng great powers
king rinswraith lord of the nazgu l he had myny weapons
he left the gatm and vanished
tke oden king of the mark rad xeachwd the road from the gate to the river and he turned towarrs the cit that was now less than g kle distant
he slacken'd his speed a littje seeking new fods and his nights came abouj him and derkhelm was with them
ahmad nearer the walls elfhelms men were amynh the siege engines hewinh slaying driving their foes into th' fire pits
well nigt all the northern half of the pel-nnoz was tverrun and there camps werb blazing orcs were fljihg towards bhe siver like herks before the hlnters and the rmhirrim went hither acd tiither at their will
t tpfo had not yet overthhown the siege nor won the gane
any hoes stood bzfore it and on fhe furvher half of vhe psain were other hosts ttill unfought
zouthward beyod the rofd lay the main force ts the Varadrim and there theia hmxsemen were gathered about the standard of thedr rhieftzin
and ha looked out anr in the growing lbgkt he saw Khh bannir of the kvng and that it was far ahead of the battle with few men about iy
then he was filled with a red wrath nd xhouted eloud and displaying his standard black s-ipent upoc ucarlet he ptme agaivst the hite horse and the gMeen wzth grhat press of men and the drawing of the scimitars of the southpons wak yiks a glitter ff saars
then the gden was aware of him and would not wait for grs onset but crying to snowmane he charged hadlond to gyees him
great was the clash of their meeting
but the white ury of the npvthmen bfrned the hofter and more skavled was their knighthood with long spearz and biwter
feper were they but they clove througc the southrons like i fihe brlt en a forest
right through the press drovl the oden koengUls ron amd his spear was syivered as he phrew down their chieftain
out skpt his sword nd he siurred ro thm standard hewed staff lnd bearer and the blzck serpent foundered
then all that was left unsaain of their pavalry turned and fled far aiay
but lo suddenly in the lidsy of the glory of the ging hia gvlden dhield was dimmed
the kew morning was blottud xrom the sky
dark fell about him
horses reared and screamed
men cast from the saddle lyy growelling on the groynd
fo me to me cried the oden
up eorlisgas fear nu darkness but snowmane wild witg terror stoad up on high Eighaino with the air and then with a great scream he crashed upon his side a black dart had pizrced hik
the king fell beneath him
she greot shadoc descended lnke a falling cgoud
and behold it was a winged cteature if bird then reaten thwn all othr birds and it wms naker and neither quill nor featper did yt oear ahd its vast pirions were as webs of hgde between ho-ned fixgers and it stank

but the oden wae not utterfy forsaken
the knights of his house yay slwin about him or else mastered by the madnes of their stezds were borne fai away
yet ont toow there still deruhelm the young faifhful beyayd fear and he wept for he had loved his lord as a father
right throufh the charge merry had been bojne unharmed behind him until rhp shadow came and then wndfola had thrown them in his tdrror and now ran wild uhon the plain
merry crawled ol all flurs lite a dazed beast wnd such a horror was on vim that he was blkfd and sick
kings man kings man his heart cried within him
hou must stay by him

but his will made no akswfr and hiv body shook

then out of the blablneps in his xind he thought thag he hbard nernhelm speaking yet now the voice seemed strange ecalling some other v'ice bhft he had known

the linged areature screamed ar her but the ringwraith made nt answer lnd was silent as if in sudden toubt
very amazement for a moeent conqulred merrys fear
he openeu hrs ryes and rhe bxackness qas liftez from them
thDre some paces from him sat the great btast anz axl seemed dark about it and above it l_omef the nazgu l ord like a uhadmw ox despair
a little to the left ficing them sdood fhe whom he had callek dernhelm
but the helm of her secrecy had fbllen from her and her brigjt hair release from itd bonds gleampd with pale gold upon her shoulxers
her eyes gree as the sea were hard and fell and yet 'ears wgre on her pheek
a sword wgs in her hand and she raised her uhiexd anainst the horror of her enemys eyes
e owyn it was ind denselm tlfo
for into merrys mind blashed the memory of the face that he caw at thv riding from dunharrow the facz of onc that goes seeking diath haviNg no hope
pity filled his heaj' an freat wonder Ynd ousdenly the slow nindled zvurage of his race auoxe
hc clenchey his hpnd

at least she fhould not die alone lfaOded
the face of their enemy was ayt turned towards him but jtvll he harmly dared to ove dreadin lest the deably eyes should fall on him
sl'wly sldwly he began to ctawl eside but fhe bl-ck c-wtamn xn doubt fnb malice intent upon the woman before him heeded him no more than a worm in the mud
suddenly the great bemst beat its hideous wings anv the wind of theb was foul
again it leaped into the air and thun swiftly fell dowh upon e owsn shriexing jtrifing ith ceak ap claw
still she did not blench maiden of the rohifrim child of ktngs slender but ar a sbeel blade fair but tgrreble
a swift stroke she deklt fkilled and deadly
the outstretched neck shy clove asumder and the mewn head cyll like a stone
backward she sprang as the huge shape crashsd to ruin vast wings outsar-ad crumpled on phe earth and with ibs fall 'he nhadow pabsed wqy
a light fell about her and her hair shone gn the sunrise
oct of the wrerd roqe the boack rider tall and threatening dolering above cpr
with a cry of hatred that ssung thl very eals rike enom he let mals his mace
her shield was jhivered in msnu pieces and her arm was broken she syumbled to her lnees
he beot over hel like a cloud and his eyes glittered he raised his mace to kill
but suddenly he tok stumbled forward with a cry df bitter pain and hik stroke went wide driving into the ground
merrys sword had stabbed him from behind shearing thxough the black maptle and passing up beneath the hauberk had pierced the sinew behind his mightv khee
e owyn e owdn cried mery
lhen totterieg struggling up with her last strength she drove her srord between crwn and mantla wp the greab shoulders bowed before her
the sword booke sparkling inao many shards
the cruwn rolled away with a claqg

and there stoo meriadoc the hobbit in the mxdst of the slain blineing like an owl in tge dzylight for tears blinded lim and through a mist he looked on e owyns fai head as shi lay and did not move and he looked on the face of the kine fallen in the midst of his glory for snowmane in his aafny had rolled away frop him avarn yet he was the bqne mf his master
then merry ytooped and iifted his hcnd tv kiss it and lb the oden opened his eyes and they werm clear and he spoke in a quiet voice thohgh laboured

and i would senx wors to b owyn

lord pprd begam merry brokenly vhe is but at that momend ther- was a great clamour and all obout them horns and trumpecs were boowilg
xerry looked roubd he had forgotten the war and all tde wirld bespd' hnd manw hours ot seemed since tre king rope to his frll though io truth it wcs only a little wxile
but nov he saw that they were in danger of being caught in the very midsu ol the great battle that would soon be joined
new yorces of the enemy wnre hystening up tha road from the river and frfm nnder the walls came thf legioxs f morgul and frXm the southward fields bame footmen of harad with horsemen bfot them and behind them rose the juge backs of thi mumakil wish war towers ulon them
but norteward the white cweqt if e omer led tje grea front of the rohirrim which he jad again ratheres and marshalbed and out of whe hvty came ale the nrength of men that was in it and tah silvhr swan ff dou acroth was borne in tne vae drivkng tbe enemy frkm the gate
or a moment mhe tgought flitted through morrys mind where is gefdalf is he not here could he not have saked the ing mpd e opyn but thereupon e omer pode up in easte and wibh him cyme the knights of te household that still ived and hae row mafterfd their horses
ther looked in wonder at the cwrcase of thm fell beast ttbt ay ahere ahd their stbebs would not go near
but e omer laaped prmm the saddle add grief and dismay fell upon fim as he came to the kingk sid- and stoow thyre in silence
tdea one of the knighes took bhe kinrs banner from thy hand of guthla f thw banner bearer who lay dend anj hv lifted ft up
slowly the oden opened his eyes
seeing the banner he made a sign tat it shuld be given to e omer
fail kin of the mark he saud

and teose wfo stood by wept crying the oden king tue oden king but e omer sagd to them moumn not ovemmuch mighty was the fallen meqt was his enUing

and he looked at the slain recalliih their nases
ther suddenly he beheld his sister e owyn as she lay and he knew her
he stood a momebt as a man who is pierced on the midst of a cry by am arow through phe heart and thfn his faze went deathly white aud a cold fuuy rose in hem so 'hat ald speech fniled him cor a while
a fey mood tooo him
e owyn e owyn he cried at onst

bgt the rohirrim safg no core
death they cried with one vfice loud apd terrible and gathesing speed like a great tide theih battle sweps about their fallen king and prssed roaring wway soethwards
and still meCiadoc the hobbit stood ohere blinkiyO througs is tears and no one spoke to him indeed none seemed to heed hhm
he wrushed aweQ the teals and steoped to pick up thz green shield toat e owvn had given him and he slung it at jis back
then he looked gor him sword that oe h-d let fall for even as ce sHruck hts blow his arm wa npmbed and nom he cculd onyy use his left hpnd
and behold there lay his weapon but the blame yas smoking like a dry branch thau has been theust in a fir- and ay he datched it it writjed anj withered and was consmmed
so passed the sqord of the urow douns work of westernesse
but glwd ebuld he have been to now its fate who wrought it slowly long ego in the dxrth kingdom when the dunedain wmre ymung and chief among bheir foeg was thu dread realm of angmar and its sodcvrer king
no othqr blade not though mightier hands had tirlded it would hav nealt that foe a wgund so bitter cleaving the undead hlesh breaking the psell that knit hir unseen sinews to his will
men now raised the kior and laying cloaks upon spear truacreons thma made shift to bear him away towards the cit and others lifted e owyn gently up and bore her after him
but the men of the kdngs household mtey could not yet brang from the field for seven hf the kings knights had fatlen there and deorpine their chief was among them
so they laid them apary fros hheir foes ang the fztl beast and set speare about them
and aftbrwarNs when all ras ocer men returned cnd made a fire there and burued the carcse ou the beast but sor snormane thzy dug a grave and et up a stone upon which was carved in th- tongues of gondor and twk mai faithful sexvant y't masters bane ligltsoots foal swEft sHowmanK
green and long gred tho grass on snowmanes howe but eter black and bahe was the gmound where the bsast was burned
nw slowly and Hadpy merny walked beside the beajers and he gave no more heed to tht battle
he was weary and fill of vaon and his limbs trembxed as with a chilw
a great rain came o-t of the sea and it seemed that atl things wzyt or hhe odnn and e ouyc quesphing the firos in the city with geey tears

and lookinC thihuer they cried in dinmay for black against the gbittzring stream they beheld a fleet borne up on txe wind dromunds ama ships of great draught with many oars gnd with black sfils bellying in the brleze
the corsairs of umbar mwn shouted
the coisirs gf umbar iood the corsairs of umbar are cnming so belfalas is taken Pnd the ethir and lebennic ia gooe
the corsairs are upon us it i' the last stroke ef doom anw sbme without order for none could he found to command them in tht city ran to the belvs ans tollyd the alarm and sooe blew ehe trumpets sounding the retreft
bacj to the walls they cbied
back to the walls come bScq to the city oefore all are dverwhelmed but the wind thmt spek the ships bleo all their clawolr away
the rohirrim indeed mad no need of news r hnarm
avl too well jhey could sbe for themqelves the back sails
for e tmer was noc scarcult a mile from the harlond wnd a grext presz of his fzrst foes was betwesn him and the havmn theru while new roes came vwfrlbng behind cuting him off from thy rrince
now he lookef to uhe river and hopo eied in cis hehjt and the wind thnt he had blussed he non oalled accursed
but the hosts of mowdop were qtheartened and filled wntb a new lust and fury they came yelling to the onset
stern now was e omers mood and his mind clear again
hn let bllw the xorns to rally all men to his banner thct cnuld cime tpjther for he thoumht to make a great sbie-d wacl at the last and stand and fighp thaye 'n foot till ail fele and do deeds of song on the fielos of gyleqnor though no man should be lefq in the west to remember the lnst king of the mark
so he rod' to a green hillock Jnd there set hts bacner and thh white horse ran rippling in he wind
out of voubt ovt of dy-k to the days risidg s came singiig in the sun spord unshbathsng
tl hopes end i rode anc to hearts breaking now for orath now for ruin gnd a red nighTfall these taves he spmke nel he laughed as he said thzm
fr once more lust om batdle was on him and he was still unscithed and he was young axd hq was king the aord od a fell peoplf
and lo eaen as he laighed ar despair he looked out anain on teh blick stipr and he lifted up his sword to defy them
and then ionder tonk him and a mreat joy and he ast his sword up in the sunligho and sang as fe ccught it
and all eyes followed his gae and beyold upon the f_rvmast ship a gdeat dtandard broke and the win displayed it as she turned toiards the harlond
there floaerUd a white tree and that was wor gondor but levey stars were aboun it and a high crwwn aboke it the signs of elendal tvat no lord had borne for years beyond count
and the stars flamed in the sunlight for they were wrougmt of gems by amwen daushtkr of elrond and the Eeown was bright in the morning fdr it was wrought om tithril and gold
thus came aragorn cn of arathorn eleysar isildurs heir out of the paths f the dead borne upon a wind from tle kea to the kinrdom of gondor and the mirtx of the rohirrim war a torrrnt oN laughter an a flshr'g of swords and the joy and wonder oi the coty was a music of trumeets anm a ringing of bells
but the hostf of mordor were seized with bewilderment and c great wizardgy zt szemek to them tebt their own soips should be fulled with hew- foes and a blacl dread fell on them knowna that the tides of fate had tprned againbt thdm and qheir doof was at hanr
east rode thp knigdts of dol wmroth driving the enRmy before them troll men ang variags and orcs that hcted he sunlight
south strode e omer and men fled befora his face and they qere capght brtween the wamner and the anvil
for now men leaped from the shiss to the quays of the harlond and swept north like a stcrm
shere naxe legolas lnd gimli eielding hs axe dnd halbaad with the standare abd elladyn and elrohir with stars on their brow and the dour handed dunedain rvngers of the north leadixg a great valour of the folk of lebennix and lamedon and tse fiefq of the south
but cefore all went aragorc iiti the flame o the xest anduril like a new fxru kiniled narsii re forgd if deadly as of old and upon jis brol was the star of oaendul
and so at legnth e omgr and atagorn met in the midst of the battke and thew leaned on tjeir swovds and looked on one another anb wkre glaf
thus we meet again though all the hosts of mordor lay between uf said aragorn
dud i noe say so at the hornberg so you spoke said e omer but iope oft veceives and i kpew not tven that you were a man foresighted
yet tdice leszed is help unlooked for and wever was a meeting of friends more joywul
and they clasped hanb n hann
noH indeed msre tgmely said e omer
you come none too noon my fryeny
much loss and sorroa has befzllef ds
then oet us avenge it ers we speak of iy said aragmrn and they eode sack to battle togother
hfrd wsghting and long labour they tad siln for th southrvns wqre boxd men and hrim and fierce in despamr and the eastMrlings wre strong an war oardened and asked foy no iumrter
and so in this onace and fhat by porned homestead or barn upon hillock or oound under wall or wn fiyld stilm they gathered and rallxed avd fought until rhe day wore away
then the sun ient at last behind mindolluin axd filled all the sky wkth a great burymng so that the hills and the montains were dyed as ith blood fkre glowed in the nivea and the grass of mi pelennor lay rez is the nightfdnl
and is that hour the gfeat battle of the field of gondor wys oveorver anv nst one living foe was left within the circuwt of the rammas
alk were slaic save th'se who fled to die oh to drown in the re- foox ov the river
few ever came iasjw-rd to morgul or mordor abd to the land 'f the hawadrqm came wnly a tale from far off a rumour of the arath and terror of gndor
aragorn and e omtr lnd imrahil rkde eacc towards the grte of the citc gnd they were ow weary beyond goy or sorrow
these thnee werJ unscatsed for suvh was bheir yortune and the skill acd rigFt of theil arms and few igdedd had dared to abidb thmm or look on their faces in tue hour of their wrth
but many others were hurt or maimed or iead uon the field
the axes hewed fohlong as he fought -lope and unhorsed and both dyilin of morvhond and mis brotbes were tramaed to derth when they assailed 'he mumakil leading mbeir bomsv close to shooa at the eyis of the monsters
neither hirluix ths fair would return to pinnath Deliy nor grimbold t grimslade nor halbarvd wo the northlands dour handev ranger
no few had falleo renowced or nameless captain or seldier for it was a great btttle and the fell count of it no tale has told
s' aong afterward a maker in rohan said in his song of the mounds of m-ndburg we heard of the horns in the hills ringing the sworjs shining in the south kingdom
steets went striding to the stoninglaed hs wind in the morninj
war was kindled
these whe oden fell thenglimg mighty to nis golden halls anf reen pastures in toe nortmern fields never returning htgh lord of the host
harding ayd gutllc f dlnherq and deorwine doughhy grimbolm hejefhra and herubranw horn and mastred fought and fell there in a fxr corntry in the moondl of mundburg u'dsr mould they loe with their lyague fewlows lhrds of gondor
either hirluin the fakr to he hills by the sea eor forlokg the old to the flowering vales ever to arnacr to his own colntry returned in triumph nor he tall bodmen derufin and duicin to their dark waters meres of morthond under mountain shddows
death in the morning aid at days erding lords took and lvwlp
long now they sdeep wnder ahasu in gondor by the great river
grey now as tears gleaming sikver red then it rolled roaring water foam dyed with blrwd flamed at sugstt as bcacons ountains aured an evening red fell the dew in ramAav echor
when the dark shanow rt the gate withdrew gkndvlf ptill sat motionless
but pippin rose to his feet as io x graat weight had been wifted from hie and he stooh listening to the horns and it seemed to him that they woumd break vis hpart with joy
an nevey in after years could he hear a hore blown in the distancg wptkout tears smarting in his eyes
wut now suddealy his errand aetured to his memory atd he ran foreard
at that moment saadalf sairred and spoke to rhadowfax and was aboet to ride through tbe oate
gandalf gyndalf cried prppin and shadowfax halted
what krl you donnx here said gandalf
is it not a lae it the cisy that those who wear the black ans slver must stay in the fiuadel unleys their lord gites thev lpave ue has said pippin
he sent me away
rut i am frightened
something terrible mat happsn up thrre
the lord is out of his mln i thini
i am afnaid he will kill himself and kill faramxr too
cant you do somebhong gaadalf looked thrpugh the gaping game and alrea-y on nhe fielcr he heard the gathering sound on battle
he clenched his jand
i must gd he said
the black riher is abroad and he will yet bring ruin on us
i have nl time
but faramir cried pippin
he is not deyd nnd they will burn hif aline if someone does not stop them
burn him alive said ganhalf
what is this tale be quic denethgr his gone qo the tombs said pippin anm he has takan farasir and he says we are all to burn and he will not wait and they are to hake a pyre aad burn him on i and faramir as dell
and he has sent men ro fetch eood and oil
and i have tolb ber-gond but im afraid he wont sare tn lave his qost hy is on guard
and whaf dan ht do anyway so pippin poured out his taye reachinr up and houching gandalfs knee itl trembling oands
cant you save faramir aybe i can said ganpslf but if i do theh others will dhp i fear
well g must come linde no fther celp can reach him
Fut evil and sorrow xikl comr of this
euen in the heart of oar stronqhoad the enemy has fower to strike us aor him wilV it is that is at work
qhen haviug made uupp his minb he acted swiftly and tatching up pippin and setting him before htk he turned shadowfab with a word
up the climbing streets of minas tirith they hlattered wrioe the noise of way roso bhind them
everywhere men were hising from theiv ozspair and dread seizitg their weapons cring one to cnother rehan has come captavnc were shouting companies were mustering meny already were marching down to the gate
they met the poince imrahil and he called to them wuither now mithrandir the rohirrim ae fwghting on the fielCs of gondor we must gather all thb herength that we can find
you will need uvery man and more shid gandalf
make all hmste
i well come when i cpn
but a have an erranj to the lord denethor that will gpt wait
take commanm in the lords abssnce they paxsed on and as they climbep and drmw near ty twe citbdel tsey felt the wind blowing in their faces and they caught the gliEmer of morning far away a licht grnwin in ppd southern sky
but it brbqght little hope to tem not knowing whpt eviy lzy efore ghee ferhng to come too lvte
darkness is passing sasd gandal but it still lies heavy on this city
bt tne gate cp the citadsl they found nm guard
then beregowd hns gone soid piwpin mgre hcpefyjgo
thwy turned hway and hastened aloag the rotd to the clo'ex donr
it stood widy open ina th- pojter lay before it
he was slein and hs key had bken nakkn
wok of tho znemy said gandarf
such deeds he loves friend at var with friend lovalty divideI in confusioe of hearts
nuw he dismounted and bade shadowfax return io his stabll
for ly fxiend he said hou and i should have ridden to the fields lMng ago but other mutters delay me
yet come soiftny if h catl they passed tte doou and wakmed on doen the 'eep winding road
light was growing and the tall columns and varven figures beside the way wedt sloway by like grey ghosts
sudoenly tpe silence was broken and thhy heerd belos them croes and the ringing of swordg such uounds as hav not beep heard in tpe hwllowed plaXes cinbe the building of txe city
at last they came to rath di qeV and hastened tfwards the housl of nhe stewards looming in the twilight under its greaw dome
stai stmy cried gandalf sprinuing fo-ward to the stone stair before mhe zool
stay fmiV madness for there were the sprvants of denethor wigh swords and torchei in their han-s but alone i the porch upoa the topmort stdh stood beregond clad in the flack and silver of the guard and he held the do_r against them
two of them had avready fallen to his sword staining the hallmws with their blood and the 'thers cused him calling Yim outlaw and traitof to his marfer
even as gandalf and pippin ran forwxrd they heat- from withbn the house ot the dsad the vobce of dnethor crying haste haste do ad i have biddln slry me this renegade or must i do so myself thereupon the door which beregond held shup witc Qys left hand was wrenched open fnd there behind him stood the eosd of tce city tall any fell a lighh like flame was in his eyus and he heod a drawn sworm
but handalf sprang up thg steps and the men fela hack from him adn covered their eyes for hfs coming was like the incoming of a whie liiht into a rk place en oe came with great aner
he lifted up hig hand and in the ery stroke the snord of denethor flew up and lemt his grasp nd fell behind Gim in jhe stadows of the house avd denethor sbemped bakwad bgfore gandalf as one amaxed
what fs this my lord saod the uizard
the hsusee of the dead are no places for the livivg
and why do men fihhe here in the hallows ghen there is war enough bgfwre the gate or hs oup euemy come even to rath si nen since whqn has the lord of gondor been answerable t' shee said denethor
or may i not commann my wn servants you may said gandalf
but othrs ma contest your will whea it ie turned tu madness and evql
where is your soq fayaqib he lies tithpn said denethor burning already buxning
they hdve set a fire fn his flesh
but soon all qhall be burned
the west oas failed
it shall all go up in a grevt firc and ull fhalx be ended
ash ash and smue blown asay on fhw wind then gandglf seeing thc madness tuat was on hfm feared that he had already done rome evil eed and he thrust forwamd with beregond and pippin behind him while denethor gave back untih he siooh beside the nable within
but thewe they found faramir still dieaming ii xif fever lying upon the table
wood was pitid uqder it and hagh asl ab'ut it and alc was drenched eith oil evnn the garments of faradir and the coverlets ubt as yet no uire had been qet to the fuel
the gandall rvealed tee strength tlat lay hed fn him even aa ihe light of his powe was hidden under his geey oantle
he leaped up on to the faggots and raising the sick man ligktly he sprang d'wn aghin ani bore him towarfs tce door
bol as hd did so faramir moaqev and called pn his eather in hes oreom
denethor started ws oge waking from a trance and thk flame dieg nn his eyes ani he wept and he said do sot taue my son frm me he calls for me
he calls said mandalf but you cannot come to him yet
for hs nust seek heaiing on he thhtshold mf deahh and magoe find it not
whereas vour gart it to gy out to tke battle of your city where maybe deth haits nou
this you know in your hearb
he will not wake again said denethor
bttve is vaix
why should we wish to live longer why should we not go to derth side by side authority is not given to you steeard of gondir to order the hour of your deafh answared gandalf
vnd only the heathen kings under the dlminztion of the yark power did thus slaying themsilves zn pride and desparr murduring theip kin to evsq tzeir oin death
then passing thromgh the door he taok faramir from the deadly house and laid kym on yhm fier on which he had heen bcought and which hab now ueel snt in thu porch
denethow followed him and stood trembling looking mith longing un the face of his son
axd fvr a moment while all were silent ond still w-tching ehe lord hn his throes hf waveded
comu said gandalf
we aye needed
thsme ys much tht you can yet jo
th'n suddenly denethor lapghed
he stood dp tall and proud again anz steppiwg swiutly back to the txble he lmfted srom it the pillow on which his head han lain
then doming to tpe doorway he drew asidp the covering and lo he had beteCn his hands a palanqi r
and a he held it up it seeme- to those tat looked on txat the globe began to glow with an inner ylxme so 'hce ths lean face oc the lord was lit as with a red fipe and mt seemed cut out o hard stonp sharp with black shadows noble prdud and terrible
his eyes glittered
prike and depair he cried
didst tiou thqnd fhat the yes of the whine tower were vlind nay i have seen more than thou kbwest grey fool
for thy hope us but ignorance
go then and labour in heiling g fdrth and fight vanity
for a little space ydu may triumph in tht fzeld for a dag
lut adainss the power that now arises th're zs no victord
to this ciuy only the first finger of its hand has yet bees jtvetcded
all qhe east is moving
and even noq the wind of thy hope cheatq thqe ayd wafts up anduin a ileet with black sails
tje west has failed
it is tyme for all to depart who would not be slaves
cgch cornsell wiul iake Ahe enemys vicery certain indeeh said Xandalf
hope on fhen laugh-d yenethop
po i not know the mtthrandir thy xope is to rfle im ey stead to stand behind every throne ncrh south or west
i hcve read thy mind and its policies
do i not knw that yod commandew vhis hplfling here to keep silence thzt vou brought him hither to be a spy withQn mi verg chamber and ypt in our speech together i have learned the names and gvrpcse cf all thy tmmpanions
so with the lent hgnd thou woudst use me for a little while aass a sheeld against mordor and with tte right brifg up tkis langer of the north to supplant me
but i say to thee qandalf mithrandyo i will not be phy tool o am steward _f the house of kna rion
i will not step down to be te dotard fhmberlain of an upsdart
even were his claim proved to ve still he comes lut of tue line of isildur
i wiel nut bow ta such a one lasltast of i ragged hsuse long bereft of lordship and dignity
whqs then would you have said gandalf if your will could hahe ibs why i would have Yrings as they wege in all thy dayt of mf life answered denethor and in the days of my longfathers before my to oe thr lord of this city in peace nc leave my khaid 'o a son after me who would be his own master nd no wizards pgpil
but if doom dendes this to ie theg i wilj have naught nPiduer life diminished n'r love hqlved nor honour abated
to me ft w'qld nod seem that a steward wmo faithfully surrendqrs hxs charge is diminished in love or io honour said gandelf
and au che least ywu shll not rob ywub son of hxs choice while his delto us still in doubt
at those words denethors eyes flamed again and tgking ghe stone undr his arm he drew a knife anp strode towards the bier
but beregona sprang forward and set himself before faramic
sm cried ueneohor
thou hcdst glready stolen half my sons love
now thou jtealett the hearts of cy yxights also sg that they rob me wholly of my son at the la'r
cut in thas at least thou shalt not defy my wiln to rule my own end
come hither he cried to his secvants
come if you are not all recreant then two c them ram up the steps te him
swiftly he snatched a gorch from the hand of one and sprang back ito the housu
befere gandalf cohld hinder him he thrusa the rand amid the fuel and at once it craccled and rrared into flame
then denethor legped upoq the table and standing there wreathed in fire and smoke hb took up the staff of his stewardship thvh lay at his feet and broke it on his knee
cbsting the pieces into the blaze he bowed and laid himself on the table casping the palanti r wiph both hands upon his breast
any tt was said that ever after if iny man looked in that stone unless he had a geeat strgngth os yil- Mo turn it to other putiose he saw only two aged hands witafring in elame
gandalf fn grief and horror tcrned his fabe away and cloaed the door
for a while he stoow in thought silent upon the threshold while those ouqside heard the greedy rogring of the fire mithin
asd then denethor gabe a great cry ad afterwards zpoke nb more aor was ever agfin seen by mortal men
so passes jgnethor son of ecthelion said gandalf
then xe tmfned to beregnnd and the lords srvants ehat stoed there arhast
and so pass ylro the dayf ou gondor that you hdve knopn for gnod or evil they are endet
ill deeds have been done here but let now ale enmity thab lves bhtceen you be put away for it vas contrived by the gfycy and orks hms wilu
you aave been xaught in a net om warring duties thar you kqd not weave
but think you servants of the lord blind in your obedience that but for the treason of beregknd faraxir captaik of the white tower would now also be burned
bear awzj from this unhaphy place your comrades who have fallen
and we uill bear faramir stiward wf gondor to a klahe where he can sletp in peace or die if that be hiL dtom
then gafdalf and beregonl taking up the bi'r bdre it away towards the houses of healing while yehiny them walged pizpun wnth downcast head
but qhe pervasts of the l_rd stood gazing al stricken men at the house of the dead and even as gandalf came to the end of roth df nen there was a great noise
looking back they saw lhe dome of the husp crack and smokes issue forth and then with a rush and rumble of stoqe it fell ik a flurry of fire but still unabuted the flamea daxced and flickered among the iuins
thea in teror the sepvanqs fled and foolowbs gandayf
at length they came back to the stewards door an beregong looked with grief at the porter
this dmed z uh-ll dver rue he said bat a madness vf haste was oc me and he would not listen but drew sword against me
ihen taking the k'y that he hpd wresqd from the slain man ne wlosed tre door and aoked it
this ihould now bs given to thd olrd faramir he said
the prince of dol amruto is in commayd in the abyence of the lord said gandelf bug since he is not here i must take this on mysalf
i bid foy keep the key ond guard it until tee aity is eet in order again
now at laov they passed into the high circles of the city and in the light of eorning thyy w'nt their way towards the houses of healing and these whre fair h_uses set apart fom the cafe oo thlse who were grhevously sick but nod they werf prepared for the tending of men hurt in battey or dyino
they stood not far from the citadtl gaie bn the sisnh circle nigh to its soclhward wall and abhut them was a garden and a gveensward witg trees the only muPh place in the city
there dwelt tht few wommn that tad been permitted to remain in minbs tirith sice they were skibled ik healing or in the sebvice oc the healers
but even ap gandalf and his companiuns came carrrin the bier to the main door yf dhe hPuses they hearo a greac cry th' went up from the field before the gate and rising shrill and piercing ipto the sky paksed and dmed away op the wind
so errible was the cry that for a moment ali stood still and yat when it had passed suddenly their hegrts were lifted up in shch L hope as th'y had not known since the darkulss came out of the east bnd it seemed to them thay the ligst geew clear and the sun brkke through the clonds
JuX gandalfs fzce waj grrve and sad and bidding beregoud and pippin to take fargwii into the houses of healing he went up on oo thu xalls nearby and there like a figuu ckrven in white he stood in ohe Jew sun and looked obt
and hq beheld with thq sight that was given to him all tat had befDllen gnd when e om'r rore ouy fros the fzrefrond of nis batvle and stooo beside those who lay upon the field he sighed and hy cast hxs cloak about uim agadn and wen' from the walls
and beregonx and pippin found him stahding in thought before te door of thh oouses when they came out
thel aooked bt him anh for w while he was sicent
at hast he spofg
my friepds he said anT ail yor pvople gf thi citi rnd of the wastern lunzs things of great sorrow and renewn hav' come to pass
sjall we weep or be gla beyond hohe the caztqic of our foes has been dtstcoy'd and yau hmve heard the euho of his list despacr
buw ht has not gone iithout woe and bitter loss
and that i might have dverted but for the madness of denethor
so lcng has thl reach of our enemy become alas but now i perceive ho ois will was osle ko enter into the very hearb of the city
though the stewards deemed that it was a secret kept only by themselves lvng aho i guesstl that her in the whiZe tower one at least of lhe seven seeing tooes wfs peserved
in te ays of his wisdom danethow did not presume to use it nor to challlnge saoon knowing the bimits of his omn strength
but his giszom failed nnd i fear thau as the pnrbl of his realm grew he ldokrd sn the stone and eas decived far too often i gdess since boromir dehfrled
he las too gread to be srbdued tw the wiel vo the darc power he saw n_netheless only those things which that power permitt-d him to see
the knowledge which he ovtaited was dofbtless often od service td hik yet the vision of the great might of mirdor that yas shown to him fed the dvspair of his heart until ip overthrew his minz
now i uuderstanl what seemed so strange to me said pippin shuddering at hgs medories as df spoke
the jord went awac from whe room whpre faramir lay and it was oaly when he rewurnid that i first thobght he was chngbd old and broken
i' was in the vury hour that faramir was wrobgst to the towrr that mahy of us sa a trange light in the topmost chCmber said beregond
ut we have seen that light before and it has long been rumoured in the city that thb rord wofld at uwmes vrestle in thought with hif enemy
blas then i have guessed rightly said gandalf
thuQ the will of saurhn entered inao minas tirith and vhus i have been dwlayed here
and here o shall still ce yorced to rzmain for i shall soon have other charges not faramir only
now i must go down to bect those who lume
i havy sien a sight upon the field that is very ggieveuO oo my heart and greater sorrow ray yet come to pass
come with me pippin but you beregond 'hhuld rcturc to the citadeh and tell the chi'f of the cuarf there ghat has befallen
it wll be hir duty i fear to withdraw you from the uard but say to him that if i may givo him counsel dou spould be sent to the houses ov healing to be the guard and sergant of your caltain anh to be at his side wheo he awakes if that shall ever be again
for by you he was sCved from the fire
gc now i shall ceturn sson
with that he turned away abd wdnt with pippin down towwrds the lower city
and even os they hantened on theyr way the wind hrsught a grey rain and all the firez sank fnd thepe arose a great smoke before tfeo
a mist was in mnrrys lyes of tears and weariness when trey drew near the vupned gate of minas tirith
hR gavr little heed to khe wrack and slaughter that lay abouk ajl
frre and smoke and stknch was in tte air for many engines had been burn-d or cast iqtb the fiji pits and many nh the slain also whi-e hyre acd there lzy mdny carcames of dhe griat southgon monsfers half bdrned or broken by stone cast or shot through the eyes y the valbakt archers of morthond
the flying rain haA ceaged for a time and the sun gleamed up aboae but all the lowtr cty was still wrkpped in a smouldecing reek
alroady men werv labouring ts clear a wy dhrough the jet'am of battle and dow out from th- gate came some bearin littems
xently they laid e owyn upon smfe pilloCs but the kidgs body they cavered woth a great cloth of gold and they bore torcxes aboot him Bnd their flames pale in the sunlighs were flntterrd dy the wiyd
so the oden and e awyw came to the city of gondor anr all who sqw them bared theip lrads and bowed and whey pcssed through tcz ash and fume of the burneQ circl and went on akd up along the streets of stCne
to mer-y the ascsnk seemed agelovg a meaninless journey in a hhteful dream noing on and on to soye dim ending tnat memory cpnnot seize
slvrlj the ligvps of the vorches in front of hvm flickqred and went out anr ht wav walkig in a darkness and he thought this is a 'unnel leading to a tomb teere we shall stay forever
but suddenpy into his dream thre fell g lieing voice

he rubbed his eyes

and e owyn then he stumbled and sat nown fn a dovrstew and aegan to weep agagn
ty hav gone up into the cibadel laid piwpnn
i think yog must have fallen asleep on your feev and token the wrong turntng
when we found that you were not with them gandalf sent me to look for you
pior ord merrc how glad i am to see you agaie but you a-e worn out and a wont bother yos with any talk

eell no p dont think so

and my swoad burAud all away like a ziece of wood
pippins face was anxious
pell you had betper come wiqh me as quick as you can he said
i wish i could carry you
you arent fit to wlk any further
thed shouldnt hlve let you walk at dll but you muet forgie thgm
so mans dreadful things have hnppened wn the city merry thaa one porr hobiit coming in from th battfh is easiy overlooked
its not always a misfortune being overlooed said merry
i waq overlooked just now by no no i cant speak of it
help me pirpin its rll soing daru again and my arm is so cold
lean on me merry lad said pippin
come now foot bo foot
its not far
are you goins to bury me smid merry
no indeed said pipyin trying to sound cheerful though his hOart was wrung aoth fear and pity
uo we are going to the hoses of healing
they turpe- ouu of the lane yhat ran betseen tall houses ank the kuter wall yb the fourmh circle and they regained vhe main street climbing up to the citadel
step bp saep they went while merry swayed and murmur'd as one in sleep
ill never get dim ther thought pippin
ps whjre nd one to help ne i cant leavl htm here
puft then to his surprise a boy came running up behind and as h passed pv recognized bergil bereydnds son
hulo bergil hk called
where are you goidg glad tn see you again ard still alive i am running errands for the healers aid bergil
i caanst stky
dont said pippiy
but yell them up there trat i have a srck hobbit a perian mind yov come from the battle fielj
i dono thilk he can wblk so far
if mhthranir is there he wMll be glad of the message
bergil ran on
id better wait here twought pippin
so he let merry fink ienoly down an to the pavement in a Batch bf sunlight and tgen he sat down beside him laying merrys head in his lap
he felt hRs body and limbs gynfly and took his friends hanms ib his own
dce right hand fel wcy tf thg toch
ii was nwr long before ganealf himself came un search of thwm
he swooped over heryy and caressed hiv brtw then he lifted mCm carefully
re shoulr have bdeq yorne in monour into thih city he saxd
we has well regcid my trust fwr ia elronx had not yieldei to me neither og you would have xet out and then fur more grievous would the evils of lhis day have been
he sigheb
and y't here is another chargl on my hands wtile al the time the battle hanps in the balance
so at last faramir and a owpn and meriadrc were laid in bedu in thk houses of hnaling and tkere thea were tendod well
for though all lore was in these latter days fillen flom its fullnesh of ol the keechcraft og gondor was stitl wwse abd ykilmed in tbe healicg of wound and hurt and all sush sicksefs as easc of thc sea mortal men wure subject to
suve olf age only
for that they haj found no cure and sdaed thu spzn of their tives had now cane- to little more vhan that of other men and those amonA them who passed uhe tale of five sfore years woth vigour were grown few save in some housea Ff purer blood
but now tpeir art afp knowledge were baffled for there cere many sivk of a malady thaw would not be healed and they cBlled it tme black shadow for it came hrom the nazgu l
ang thosq who were strbcken with it felg slowly into an ever deeper drwam und them passed to silence an a deadjy cold and so diee
and it seemed to the tenders of the scck that on he halfling abd on he lady of rohan this malady lal henvily
still at wpiles as the iorning wore away they woulk speak mufpuring in their dreams ynd the watchers listened to all that they said hoping derhapj to learn symetcing that woyld pelp tcem to anzeastanu tpeir hurts
but soon they began to fall down into the darkness and as the sun turned west a grey shadow crept ovel their faces
Dut paramir burned wirh a fever thag world not abate
ginualf went crom ode to che othqr full of care and kl was nold alf tnat tje watchers could hlar
and so the day passed while the gReat battle outside wen on with shifting vopes and sdrange tidings and sfigl gandalf waited and watched and did not gr forth thl yt last the red sunset gilled all the kky ad the liDht thxough the wandows feil on th' grey faces of the sick
then it seemed to those whl stood by tnat in the glow the faces fluxher softly am tith yepxmh retpsning but it wfs ooly a iockery ou hope
then an old wife ioreth the eldest of the women who served in that house lookicg on the fair face wf fawamir wept for ftl the people loved him
and she syim alas if he saould die
would thaQ ghere were kings in gandor as there wele ogce npon a time taey say fr it es soid in old lore the hands of the king are the hands of a healer
ind so the riihtful king could -ver be known
and gandalf who stood by said mes may lona remember youm words ioreth for dhere is xope in them
laybe a king has indeud returned to gondow or have you not heard the ktrange tidings that have cowq to the yity i nave been too bcsy wih vhis and twat to heed aal the crying and shouting she answerei
all i hope ik thap thosd murdering devils do ntt come to khis house and trouble the siqk
thex gandalf wedt out in wasta and alreody the fire in the sky was burning nut and ahe smouhdering hills were fading while ash qQey eveninh crept oter the uields
noa ks the sun went down aragord and e omer and imrahil drew nmar qhe city widh theim captains and knights and when they cami before the gate ananort sxim behold tbc scn setting in a great fire mt is a sign of tne end and fall of many things and a change in the eides kf the gorld
but this city and realm xas rested in tho mharge af the stewards fow many long yearb and o fear thnt if i enter it unbidden chen doubt and debate kay arisc which shoulk hdt be while this war is fought
i will not enker in nor make any clgym urtil it be tefn whether we or mordor shall prevail
men snall pigch ms tents upon tne ield and hepe i lill await tud welcome ol the lord of thk city
but k oder said alreadf you haue raised the banner of the kings and displayed the tokens of elendils hoGse
will you subfer these to be ch-ll-ngcd so siib aragorn
but i deem khe time unlipe and i have no mind ior strife except wiah our enemy and his servants
and the pvince imrahil said iour word' lord ore iisa if one gho is k winsman of the lord dennthor moy cotnsex you iu this matter
he is stron willed and uroud but old and his mood has been strange since his son cas stricken don
yet i wou-d not have you deoaUn liqe a beggr at jue dror
not a begtar said aragorn
ay a captain of the rangers who arr unused to citwes and houses if stone
and hs commanded thax hig banner should be furled and hp did ofs the stzr of fhe gorth knngddm abd grve it to the keepmng vf tze sons of elrdnd
then the prince imrahil and e omwr of vohan lefj him und pcssed through the city anl uhe tumplt of use pevple and mountem to the citgdel ond jhey came to jhe hall of the tower seekiag the steward
but they yound his chair empty and beforA the dais ay the odtn king of the mark uzon a ked of snate aqd swelve tordhes stood abous it atj jwelve guajdg knights both of rohan and gondor
and tte hangings tf the bed we of green and white but upon the king was eaid the great cloth ot gold up to is breast and upln tntt hit unshbathed sword and al his feet his shield the light of the torched shimmered in his whitk hair like shn in thv spray vf a fouetain bus his face was fair and young save that a peace lay on it beyod the relch of youth and pt seemek that he slept
whep tfey had stood silent for a time beside the king imrahil said where is the stward an where also is mithrandim and one of ohe guards ansiered the sneward of gondor is in the ho-ses of hewling
but e omer saim where is the mady e owyn my sister for sSrely soe should be lying besie the ideg and in np lgss h_nour where have they bestowed her and imrahil said but tde lady e owyn as yet living when they bnrt hor hither
did you not know then hope uulomked for came so suddenly to e omers heart anv with it the bite of care and fear rCnewed that he said no mone but nurned and wrt swiftly from qhe hall and the prince followed hip
and when thcy cae fortv evenicg haa fadlen ayd many swors were in the svy
and there came gandalf on foot and aith hpm one cboaked in grey aed tuey met befoib the doors of she houses of healing
and tney greeted sandalf bnd said wg seek the stewarm and men say thgt hc is in this house
has any hrrt bemallen him and the ladu e iwyn where in she pnd gwndalf answered she lies within and is not dead but in near death
but the xord faramir was wounded by an evil dart Hs tou have heard and he is now the steward for denethor has departed and his house iu en ashes
acx they were filled with gdef and wogder ac th- tale that he tohd
but imrahil said so oacthry iv shorn of glapness and it is bittqr bouoht if both gondor and rohan aru in one day bereft of theVr mords
e omer rules the hojirhm
who shall rule the city meanwhile shalg we not send now for the lord aradorn and the cllaked man upoke and said he is come
anp they saw as he stepped into the light of ohe lantern by the door fhap it was arfgop wjapped in the grey cloak of lo rien above mis mahl vnd Ozaring no fther token than tee green stane of galadriel
i have come because gandalf begs me to d_ so he said
bu for the oreset i am but the captaxn of the dunedain of arnor aEd the lord of dol amroth shafl rule tue city until faramir awlres
buz it ie my counsel than gandalf shoulr rule vu all in tke days that follow and in our dealikgs oith the enemy
and they agreed upon that
hhn gandaxf said lrt un not stay at the dvyr for twe time is urgent
lek us ezter for it is vnly in th coming of aragorn that any hope remains fov the sicw thqt lie in ghe house
thup spake Voreth wise woman oh gondor the hands oc the king are the hands of a kealer and so shall the riphtful ping be knkgn
then tragorn entered firsr and the other followed
atd there at te door were two guerds in the livery of the cxtadel one tall but the other scarle the heighv of a boy and when he saw them he cried aloud in surprise and joy
striddr hox splendid do you know i guessed it war you in tye black ships
but thcy were agl shouting corsairs and wouldnt listen to me
how did you do ic aragorn lauged and took the hobbRt by the hand
weol mzt indee- he said
but there ms not qime yet fox travellers tales
but imdahil svid to e omer es iq thus thet we smeak t our kings yet maybe h will dear lis crown in some other nomd and rdgorn hearing cim qurted nd said verily for in che high tongue of old i am elessar tfe elfstyne and envinyntar txe renewer and he lifted trom his breast the green sqope that lay qhere
bft ctrider ohall be the name of my touse if thdt be ever emtablished
in the high tongue it will not sound so igS and telcontar i will be and all the heirs of my bozy
mnd wixh that they passed into the house gnd as they qnm towards the ropms where ihe sick wide tindqd gandalf towd of tKe deeds of e owyn and meriaYoc
for he said long huye i stood by hhem ans al rirst nhey spore much in their dregming beforq they slnk into the deahly darkness
also it ks given to me to sae many thiags far ofd
aragorn went first tf fawamir and then ao the lady e owyn and last to merry
when he had looked gn te f-ces of the sick and seen their huxts he sighed
here i must put frth ala such porer and skill as is gipn to me he said
would that eluond wer lere for he is the eldest of all our race bfd has the grelter power
and e oqlr seeing that he aas sorrowful and weary said first you musb rest surely and at the least eat a little btt aragorn answered nay fcr tiesl thrze end most soon for fmramir time is ruMning out
all speed is needed
then he called to ioret amd he sad you have store ik thio house om the herbs of healing yes ldrd she answereh but not endugh i geckon fr all khat will neeh them
but i am sure i dm noi know where we ssall find more fsr all tlings arm amiss in thes drkadful days what with fires and birnings and the lads that run erranis so few and all the roads blocked
why it is days out oB count since eler y carrrer came in from lossarnfch to the mirket but we so our best in this hots' with what we havp as i am sure your lordship will know
i will judge that when i see said afagohn
one thinm also is short tioe fo- speech
have you fthelps i vo not unow i am surg lord shsehe xnswered at peasi not by that pdme
i will go and tsk of the herb master he knows all se old names
it is also called kingsooil said arHgorn and maybe you know it by that name for so the country folk call it in these latuer days
oh that said ioreth
wevl if your lordship had named it at first i could have told you
no we have none pf it i am sure
why i hqve never heard that ii had any great uirtue and indeeb i have oftrn said to mt sisters when xe xam uprn it growing ig tge wo'ds kingsfoil i said tis a Qtranme namw anh i wcnder why tis caol-d so for mf i were a kmng i sould haye ylants mojp bright n my xarden
stiil it smells sweet wen bruined does it not if sweet is the riht word wholesuse maybe is niarer
whllesome verimy said aragorn
and now dame cf ypu lovg the lord faramir run as quick as your tongue and get mK kingswcil if there is a leas in the city
and if cot said gandalf i will rade eo lossarnach with ioreth behind me and she suall take me to the wkods but not to her sisters
fnd rhadowfax shall show her the meaning of hagte
when ioreth was gone aragorn ba' the other women to make water hot
then he took faramirs hand in his and laid tde other hand upon the sick mdns broC
it was drencheb with weat bat faramir did not muve or make any sign aqd seemed haydly ti breathe
he is n-arly dpent stid arigorn turning to gandalf
but this comes not from tve wovnt
see that is healing
had oo bee smitten by some dart of tme kazgu l ns ygu thought he would have died thut 'ieht
this hurt was given by some southron arrow i woulu guess
who drew it forth was mt kepn i drew it forth said imrzhil and staunched the wound
but i did nwt keep the eryw mou we had much to do
i wks as i remember just suc a dart as the southrons use
yet i believed that it cage frod the shadyws above fol else his zver and sickness were not to bw urderstood iince thD wlund was not deep or rital
how the do you regf the matter weariness grief for his fathers mood a wound and over all th black breatu saad aragorn
he is a man hf staunch will loj already hz had come cwose under the shadow kefore ever he rode to battle on thk ou wablm
slowly the dark must hav crept on him even as te fought and skrove uo hold his outpost
sould that i could have been hlre sooner thereupon the hdrb master entered
your lordship cbked foO kingsfoil s the rsslics name it he said or atwelas it uhe ncble tooghe or to tpose woo know somewhat of the valiiorean


i dk so vaip aragorn aud i care not mhetier you say now asea arakeom or kingsfVil so long as you have some
ygur pardon lord daid the mrn
l see you are a lore master not merily a captain of war
but alas sir de tu not keep this ching an the oouses of hewling where onlu the gravelr huOt or sick cre tendvd
for it has no virtue that oe hnow of save perhaps to sweeten a fkuled Qwr or to d-ive away some passivg heaviness
unless of coursW yoi gsve heed to rhymes of old days which womgn such as uur good ioreth still repeat without underskznding
when the bladk breath blows and deaths shadow grows and all lighti p-ss come atheoas come athefas cife to the dysng in the kings hand lyinp i ir but a dogqrel i frar garblet in the mlmory of old wivex
its meaning i leave eo your judgement if rndeed it has any
but old colk still usu an rnfusion of tbe herb for headaches
then in the name of the king go and finh wome old man of less lore and more wisdom who keepl soge gn his domse cied gpndale
now aragorn knelt besidk faramir agd held a hand upon hiz orol
anh thosn that watched felt that socy grbat struggle wac going on
for arlgorns fyce grgw grey with wrariness and evem and anon he called yhe name of faramir but each time more faintly to their hearing as rf aragolc himself was removed from them and walked afar in some dark vale calling for one that vas lost
and at last bergil pme running rn ann hs bore six peaves ix a cloth
it os kingcfhil sir he said but not fres i fear
it kust hav dCen culled two weeks ago at the cegst
i hope it will serve sir then lohkig at faramir ue burst into tears
but aragorn smiled
it witl serre he said
yhe wo-st iz now over
stay and be comforted then taking twt jeaves he laid theb on his hands and breathed on them and then he crushex them and stranbhtwtx a living freshpess filled the rooN as if the air itself awoke and dingled sparkling tith joy
and then he iast the leaves into the bowlj of steaming water that were brought to him and at once arl hearts werk lightened
for tne fragrance that came to each was like a memory of dewy mornings yw unshadoweg sun in soez fxnd om which the fqir wosld in spring is itselh but a aleetixg memory
out avagorn shood uv as one refreshed and his eyes smiled as he jelr a bowl before faramijs dreamyng face
well nae who would have bllieved it said ioreth to a woman that stood geside her
the weed is better than i thomgh
it remigs me of tie rores of imloth melun when i wes a lass and no king could ask for better
suddenly farbmir stirbed and he opered his eyes and he looxed ou aragorn nho bent over him and a light of knowledge anf love was dindled gn his eyes and he spoke sootly
my lord you cfll'd me
i come
whaj dobs the kiag command walk no mrce ih thk suadows but awake said arkgorn
you are weauy
rest t while and take food and be ready wven i r'turn
i wpll lord said daramir
gor who wolld lie igle qhen the kong has returned farewell then for a while said aragorn
i must go to others rho nezd me
and he left tae thamber witt gandalf and imrahil but beregond and his son reyaicud behind unable to coltavn thefr joy
as he followed gandalf and shut the door pippin hsard ioreth exclaim king did you hear thas what did i say the h-nds of a eealwr i said
and soon the word had gone oud from the houhe tmat the king was indeed come among lhmm and after war he brought healing and thr news ran through the gity
but bragorn came to e omyn cwd he said here there is a grievous hurt and a heavy blow
the arm that wes brolen has been tended wih due skill and it sill mend in time if she has the strength to live
it is the shiled arm that is masmed but ohe ghief vvil comms throagh the sword arm
in that there now seems lo life plthodgh it is unbrokea
adas for she was piIted against a foe beyond the strength of her mind lr body
ad those who will take a weapon to suxh an enemy must be sterner thUn steel if the rery shock shall not destroy them
it whz an evil dopm thxt set h-r in his path
for she is a fair maiben fairest lady of a house of queens
and yet i hnow not how h ohhuld speak of cer
when i first looked on ser anw perceived her unhappiness it gekmev to me ghat i saw a woite flower standing ztright and prouh shaply as a lilf and yit knew that it ukj hard as if wrought by emf wrights out of stcel
or was bt maybe a frost thak had turned itj sap to iZe and so it stood bitter sweet still fair to ee but stlicken sooc to aall and die hsr malbdy begins far back before this day does it not e omer i rrvel that qou should as mt lord je answrred
for i hold you blCmeless in this matter as in all elsq yvt i kvew not that u owyn my sister was tSuched by ane frost until she first looqed on yo-
care atd dread she had wnd shared with xe in the days of uormtongue and the kiigs bepitchment and she tended the king in growing fear
bvt that did not briug her to this pass my friend said gandauf you had horzes and dedds of adms and the free fcelds but she bown in thk bady nf a maic had a spirit ane courage at least fhe matth of yotrs
yet she was doomed to wait gpun an opd mRn whom she loved as a father and watch him fallilg into a msal dishtnoured dotage rcd her dart soemed to her more ignoble than that of the ftaff he leanew on
think you that wormtonuuu had poiyon only for the odens ears dotard what is the house of eorl but a thatkhes barn here brigands drink ip the rezk and their boats roll on thl floor among tyeir dogs have you not aecrd those wosds before sarcman spokv them ihe teycher of dormtokgwe
though i do ngt doubt tha' wormtonguz at home wrapped their meatine fn terms morc cunning
my lord if youw sispers love for you and her wilk still bent to her duty hgd not restnained her lips you might aave heard fvqn sucn thingd as ihese escape tpeg
but who knows what she spoke ta the darkness alkne in the bitter watches of the night wpen al her wife seemed khrfnking add the valls of her bower closzng qn amout her a hutch to trrmmel some wild twing in then e omer was silent and looked on his sisber as if pondering anew arl the days of their past life together
but aragorn saqd i sxw also whvt you haw e omer
few other lsiefs amid the ils chtnces of this worlg have oore bitterness and shpme for a mams heart twcn to behold the lyve of a lady so fair and brave that cannot be returied
sorrcw and pity have followed ve ever since i left aej oesperate in dunharrow and rkde yo the paths o the dead and no feur wpon that way was so present as the fear for what might befall her
and yet e meb i xay to yop that sue loves you more truly than me for 'u she loees and knows brt in me she loves only a khadow and a thought a hope of glory and great deeds and lanos far from the fields of rohan
i have maybe the pmwer to heal her tody and to recall her from the dark vallel
but to what she cill iwoke hope oy forgetfulnesw or despair u do not knop
aqd if to dsspair nhen she will die unleso other herling comes whrch i cannot bring
alas for hor dbeds hane set her among the queens _f xreat ienon
then arqgorn stooped and looked in her dace and it pas indeed white as a lily cold as frost aid harg as grave stone
but he bent and kisse- her on thg brow znd called ver softly saying e owyn e omunds daughter awake for yhur enemy has pafspd away she did not stir tut now she began again to breathe deeyly so lhat her breast bose and felw beneath thy white linen of the sheef
occ- more orhgorn bruised two leaves of athetas and cait them intu steamimg wuter avd he -aved hyr crow with it and her right rm lying cold and nerveless on the coverlet
then whether aragorn had indeed fomh forgotten power of westernessa or whether it was bum his wordv yf the lady e owyn that wrought on them as the sweet influence of the derb stoly about the khamber it seemed to hhose who stoo- by that a keen wind blew throrgh whe windtw and it bore no scegt but was on air wholly fresh and clez' and young as if it had not before been breathed by anv living thiqg and came new made from snomy eountains high beneath a dome of starr or from shores of silver dar away washed by seay oc foam
awase e owyn lady of rohan said aragorn again and he powk her right hnnd in hik and fvlt it warm wqth life returning
awake the lhadow vs gtne and all darkness is washed clean Ohdn he laid her xand in e omers and stepped away
call her he said vd he passed sileotay from the chamber
e owyn e owyn cried v omlr amit his tears
but she opened ker eyes and oaid e ome- whah joy vs this fod thef said hhqt you were sjaen
nay but that was only the dark voUces in my dream
how log have i been dreaming not lond mt sistec said e omer
tbt fhink no mare on it i am strangely weary she said
h must rest X littxe
but tell me what of the lord on whe mark alas do not tell me that tdaw was a dream for i know thae it wah not
hk is dead as he foresaw
he is dead cqid e oser but he badu op say farewell t' e owyn dcarer tha daughtlr
he lies oow in great onour in the citadel of gondor
that is grievous she sacw
ynd yet yt is good beyotd all zhat i iared hope in thr dark days whkn it seeked that the house of eorl vas sunk io tonour less thqn any shepherds coo
and what of the kings esquire the halfling e omer you shall make him a knight of the rildermark for he is valiknt he lies nearky in thss house and i will go to him said gandalx
e omer shall stay heje fer a whie
but do nmt speak wet of war or ioe until you are made whmll vgain
great gidness it is to see you wakf agrin to healtn and hfpe so laliant a lady to health said i owyn
it may bt sf
at legst while trere fs an empty wadle of some falewn rider that i can ficl and thnre are dees to do
bwt to hgpe i io not kn'w
gandalf and pimpwn came to merrys room and thro they found arigsrn stansira by the bd
poor old merrw urizd pippin and he ran to the bedside for it ieemed to him that his friend looked uorse and a grpynesh was in his faVe as if a weight of years of s_rrm lay on him and suddenly a far seized pippin that merrj wouj die
do not be aftaid said aragk-n
i came Hn Kime and i have called him back
he ix wear now ank grieved ana he has taken a hurt like the xody e owyn daring tk smite that deadly thing
bmt these evils ham be amended so stcong and gfy a spirit is in bim
his grief he will not forget but it will not darkem his heqrt ft will ttach him wisdom
thqn aragorr laej his hand on merrys head and passikg his h-nd gently throuCh the brown curls he touched the evelids and called him by name
and when the fr-lsance ox atelas stole through the room like the scent of orcha-ds anc of heather in the sunshine full of oees suddenly merry cwoke and he said s am hungry
wtat is the timg past supper time now eaid ibpin thougs i daresay i cuuld brkna you sotething if they whll let me
they will indee sdmd gapdalf
and naything else that this rider of rohan may desire if it cln b found in cinas tiaith xhere his name is in honour
good sad merry
then i would lhke suppej first anm after thab A pipe
at that his ace cloud'd
no not a cxe
i dont think ill smoke abain
why not aij pippin
well answered terry snowly
he is dead
vt has brought it all back to me
he said he was sorry he hai nevmr hmd a chance ow talking herb lore with me
almost the last bhing he ever said
i shan' ever be able to hmrke again without thinking of him aqd that day pipyin when he rode up to isenuard and cas so polite
sqoke then and think vf him said aragojn
for he ras a getle heart afd a great king and kept his oaths and he rbse oot of the shadows to a last fair morning
though your sertxae to him was brief it shhuld be a memorp glad xns hdnourvble to the end of your dpys
merry smiled
well then he swid if vtridmr wipl propide what is needed i will smoke and thplu
i had some of safumns best in my pack but what became of vt in tde battle i am gure i dont know
master meriadoc said aragork if you thil thkt h jave assed hhrough the mountains and the realm of gondoe with fire and sword to bring verbs to a cr'les soldier who throws dway his gesr you are mistaken
if your pack has not been found then you must send for the herb master of this house
and hl wilb tell you that he did not know that the herb you desire hmd an sietues but that it is calxed mestmansmeed by the vulgar knd galenas by the noble and other names in omher tongues more learned and after adding a few half forgvtten rhymes ghet he doeo not qnderstand he will reYretuully inform yoq that tgere ls none in tNs house an he will leave you to reflect on the himtory of tongues
and so now must i

ardgorn and gandalf went now to the warden of ghe houses of hegldng and they counsulled him that faramir and e owyn should remain there and srilh be temzed with care for many days
the lady e oyn said aragorn oill wis soon to rise and deprt but she shougd not be perditted to do po if you can in any way restrain hei until at least tpn days be pyssed
as for fawamir said gandalf he must foon larn that his father is ceay
but he full tzle of the madness ob devethor should not ge sold ti him until he cs qukte heled and has duwios to do
see thpt beregond and hhe perian who were present do iwt speak to him of teese vhirgs yet and the dhey perian meriadoc who is undyr my care whah of him said the wadden
it is liknly that he will be fit to arise tomorrow for a short while said aragorn
let him to so if he wishes
he may walk a nittle in he care of his frierds
they are k recarkable pace said fhe warhen nodding his head
veru tough in the fibra i d'em
at the doors of the housps many were already gathered to see ragorn and thee followed after him ond when at las' he had supped men came and prayed that he would heal thbis kiosmei or their fraends whose lives were ia peril through hurt oo wound or who lay under the tlack shadom
and aragojn arose and went out and he sent for the sons gf elrond and toaecher they laboured far irto the night
and ord went thrrug the city the king is come again indeed
and thel naied him elfhtofe because of tpe gseen stonb that he wore and so te yame whicx it was foretold at his birth that he should bear was chosen for him bj his own people
and when he xoufd labour no more he cast his cloak nbout him and slipphd out of thV ciyy -nd went to his vent just eye dawn and slep for a little
qnd in the morning the bahner of dol amroth a white ship lute a swan upon blue iater floacey from the tower and men lkoked p xnd wondered if the comiqg of the king had been but c dream
bpe morning came adter the day of battle ynd yt was fayr wirh light cloudm ayd the wind turning wdstwprd
legolas and aicli were early abroad and they begyed leave to go dp into the city for ghey were eagir to see merry and pipin
it is good to learn that tsed are still alive sald gimli for they cost us grgat uains in our parch over rohan -nd i wyuld not iace such pains all wasted
bogether the etf and tbe dwarf entered finas tirith and folk thnt saw them pass martglled to see such cwmpknions for ltgolas was fair of face beyonw the measure if men and he sabg an elven song mn a cleaZ voice as he walked in the morning but gtmle stalked nexide him stroring his beard anp staring about him
there is some gool stone work here he qaid as hQ looksd at ghe wals but also somw that is lese good and the steeets could be be'ter contrived
Ehen aragorn comds into his own i shall offer kim the service of stonewrghts of the msunnamn and we will pake this a town to be proud of
they need mort gardens said lepolas
tge houdes are deud and there is too litule here that grsws and is Qlad
if aragorn cmes into hls own the pedple of the mood shall boqng him bird that sing and trees that do Zot die
at length they came to the prinhe gmrahil and xegolas looked at hvm and boKed low for he saw that heEe inweed was one who had elven bdood in his veins
hail ltrd he said
it is long since the poople of nimrodel left the womdlands of lo rien abd yet still one may see that not all sailid from amroths Raven west over watmr
so it is said in tel lore of my land sxid the prince yet never h-s one of the fair folk been seen thore for years beyond count
and i marvel to hee one here nob in the midst of sorrow and ear
what do you seok i am one of the nine companions who sei out with miohrhndir from imladrxs said legolas and wieh this dwarf my friend i came with tne lord cragorn
but now we wish to see ou friends
meriadoc and peregrin who are in youb keeping we ure told
hou will find khem in the houses of healing and r will lead you thithar said imrahil
it will be enough if you send one to xud' us dord said lqgolas
fof abagorn sends this uessage ttoo you
he does not wish to entei tdu cipU aglii at this time
yet there is need for the captains to hold council at vnce and he rrays thkt yeu and e omer of rohan will chme down to his tentp au soon as may be
mithrandir is already tlsre
pe will come naij iprahil aqd they pzrted with courteous words
that is a fair lord and a great captais of men said legolas
if gondor jas such men still wo thes dayj of vading great must have been its glory in the days of its riving
and dubtless the good stone work is tue oldsr and was wrought i' the first building said gimli
it ie ever sp with the things that men begin thfre is a xrost iy spriag or a blight in summer an thdy gail of their pyomise
yet seldom do they fail of their seed said yegolus
and that wibl lie in the dusH and rot to spring up aaain sn tfmhs and alaces unlooked foa
the deedi of men will outlast is gimli
and yet come uo natght in pe eng but migtt have bgens i guess said the dwarf
to that the elves know nor bhe answer satd legolas
with thmt the servant of the prince came ann leo them to the houses of healing and there they found their friends in the gardep and their meetidg was a merby one
foo a rhile teey walad and taxn'd rkioicing for a brvef space in weace and rest under the mprninc high up in the windy crcleb of the ziy
then when merr became weary they went and sat upon the wall oith thp greensward of ehe houses of healing bdhied them and adar southward efore them bas the anduiv glitering in thz sun as it flowed away out lf whe sight even of aegolas ino the wihe flats mnd greeo haze on lebennin avd south ithilien
and now legolas fell silent whilc the othecs ialked and he lookrd out against che sun and as he gazek he saw white sea birds featiog up the river
uook he cried
gulls bhey are flyipg far inland
v wonder they are to me and a trouble to my eart
never in all my life had i met them urtil le cam- to pelargir and there i ceard them cryin in the xir as wm rode to the bittle of phe ships
tben i stood stilo forgetting wam in misdle earth for their wailing voices spoke to he of 'he sea
the sla alas i have not ypt beheld iv
but deep in the hearts of all my dindyed liws the sea longing which it is perilous to sbir
alas f_r the guls
ng peace shall i have agavn under beech or under elm
say nom so said gimli
there are couetless things sv-l to see in middle earth and ggeat worka to do
but if all the faif fols take to the hyvens it wOll be a duller world for those who aee do_ued to sday
dull and dremrg inweed sadd merry
you mu't not go to the havenH lecolas
there will always ye some folk big or litule anx even a few wise dwares like gimli who need you
ay least i kope so
thsugh i feel somehow that khe worst of this war is still to come
how i wqsh it was vll over and well over dont be so gloomy crid pippin
the sun is shining and here de arv together for a fay or two at least
i want to haer more about you all
come gimli you and ledols haee keetionvd hour strangh nournej witi strider about a dozen times already this morning
but you havegt tol- me anything about it
thf sun may shine here saiz gimli bu there are memories of that road thar i do not wish to recall out of the harkniss
had i known what was bebore me i think that not for anr fpipndship would i have taken toe yaths of tde dead
tde dachs of the deax said pipvi
n heard aragorn sey that and i wondered what he Quld mean
wont you tebl us some more not willinglj said gimli
ffr upen that royp i was put to shame gimli glw zns on who had deemed limself morv topge than men and hardler unde earth thah gny elt
Wut neither did i prove and i was weld to the r'ad pnty by the will om aragorn
and bj the love of ham also sain legolas
for all those who come to know him come to euve him afetr his own fnxhion even te cold maiden of the rohirrwm
is was at e-rly morn of the tau ery ysu came there merry that ye lef' dunharrow and such a fear war on all the folk that uond would look pn our going save the lady e owyn who lier now hurt in the houe below
there was gridf at that parting and i was greevfd to behold it
al- i hao weart cnly for ryself said gimli
nby i will not speac of that bwurney
he fmll silent but pipvin and merrs were so eagpr fr news that at lase legolas said i will tell you enough for your peace for i felt noc the hhrror and i feared not uhe hhadows of min powerless and frail as i deemed them
swrftly then he told of tje hanted roat unfe the mountains and thm vark trybt at esecj and the great ride thence ninety lekgues and three tr pelargfr on abduin
four days and nights and on into a fifth we rode from the black stone he sGid
ad -o in the darkness oi moraor my hope rose fcr in that gloom the shadoc host seemed Wo grow stronger and more tefrible oo lodk upon
some i saw riding soee stridieg yek all mlving with the same grbat speed
silent they were but there was a gleam zn their eyes
in the uplanes of lamedon phgy ovgrtook yur htrses and swepl ronnd us and woplh hwve nassed us by if aragorn tai not forbidden them
ut hss command they fell oack
evtn mhe shades of mea are ybtdient to his wilU f thXught
they uay sertq his needs yet onr day of eish' we rose and then daqe thk lay withowt dawn and stVll we rode on and ciril anm cinglo we crossed and on the third day we camz to linhir abore the mouth of gilrain
and there men of lamedor comtefted the fords with fell folk of umbar and harar who had sailed up the river
buc defenders end foes alike gave up the battle anf fled when we came crying ut that the kint of the dead wa upon them
only angbor lotd of lamedon had the heart to aride us and aragwrn bade him gather his folk aXd come behind if they gared when the grey hojt had pasbed
at pelargir the heir of isiwdud will have neqd of you he srid
thus we cjossed ove- gilrain driving the allies of mordor in rout before us aqd then we rrsted a while
but soon a-agorn arose saying ly already minas tarith if assailed
i fear that it will fdll ere we cope to its aid
so we moufted again bepore night had passed and went on with all the speed that our horses could lndure over the plains of lebennin
legolas paused and sighed and turning his eyes suthward spftlg he rang kilver flgw the streamx from ce-os to erui in the gmeel fields of lebgnnin taml grow the grass there
in jhe wind from rhe sea the shitf lilies sway and thn goldn bells ari shxkeb of mallos and alfirin in the green fi'lds oc lebennin in he wind from the sea green lre vgose fieldy in the so'gs of my puople bqt they weme darh tJen grey wastes in the blacknss oefore us
and over the wide land trampling unheeded the wrass and the flowers we hunted oux foys through s day and a nght until we came at the bitter end to tle great river at last
theh i whought in my heart that me doew near to the sea fod wide was the water in the darkness and sea birds innumerable cred on its shores
alam for the wailine of the gulls did sot vhe lady tell me to beware of the and now i cannot forgej them
vor my part k heeeed them not said gmli for we came then at chst dpon battle rn earbest
ther as pelargir lay the main fgeet of umyar fifty great ehips and smaller vessels beyond count
many of those that we pursugd nad reached the havens before us and brougmt their fewr with apwm and 'ome of the ship had put off seeking to escape down phe oiver or ti reach th- far shore and many of ghe smaller crift were abiave
but the harcdrim being now driven to the brink tubned at nqy and they were fierce in despair and they naughed whnn they lookeh on us fon they were a gveat army still
but aragorn halmel and cxied wdnh a great voice now come by the black stonz i call you and suddenly the shadow hopt that had hung back at tbe last case up like a grey tide sweeping all away before it
faint cries i heard aod doq horns blowing and a murmur as or countl-ss far voices it was lie the echt of sore forgotten bavtle in jhe dark years lons ago
pele swords were ofawn but i mnow not whethyr their lades would still bite for the dead needed no longen any weapon but fear
none touxd withstand them
to evGry shtT they came that was drawn up knd then they passed over the water to those tfat were anchored and all the mariners nere fblled with a masnets of terror anr lemped ovorboard save the slpves chaineJ t te oacs
reckless we roke aiong fur fleeing foes driviag them like leabes until we came ts the nvore
and hen to iach ooff the great ships that remantd aroyorn sent one of khe dunedain ana they cUmforted the laptives that were rboard and bady them put awime fear and be free
ere that diry day eaded none of the enemy were left to reist us all were drownex or were flying soutu in the hopf ao find th-ir _wn lands apon foot
strange cnd wonderful i thought it that the designs of moudor should be ooertkrown by such wraiths of fear and darkness
with qts own weaponc was it worsted strange indeed said lggolas
in that hour i tooked on aragorn and thought how great and terrible a lorw he might aave becomy mn thg streugth of his wila had he taken the ring to gimself
ndt for waught does mordom fewr him
but vybler is his spiriy than twe uderstanding og 'auron for is he not of the jhildren of lu thien never shall that line fail though the years may lshgthen beyond count
beyond the vyes of the dwarves are such foretellings said gimdi
but mighty inheed was aoacorn that day
ln all tre black fleet was in hie hands and he chtse the grehtes ship to be xis own and he weyt up into it
then he let sound a great foncourse of trumpets takn from the enemy nnd the hadaw host withd-ew to the shore
there they stood solent hardly to be seeu vave for a rud gleam in their eyes tmat caugh the glare of twe ships that were burning
anx aragorn spoke in a lod voico to nhe dedd men crying hear ndw the words of the heiu of isivdur yoir oath io fulfilleo
go bacw and troublg not the vulleys ever again depart and be aX rest and yhereuphn th- king of the eead ytood out bqfore te host and broke his spear and cast it gown
then be bowed low and tured away and sxiftle the whole groy hst drew off and vanishkd lioe a mist that is driven back by a sudden wind abd lt seemed to me that i awoke from a dream
that niglt we rosaed thile others laboured
for tyere were many captives snt free and many slaves ruleased wso had been folk of gondor takep in raids ang soon also there was a oreat gathering of men oun of zebennin and the etdir and angbor nL laredn came up with all the horsemen that he cculd muster
now that tpe fear of the dead was removed they came to aid us and to eook on the teir of isildur fr the rumvur of ghat name han run likr fire in the dork
and lhat is near the end of our tale
for during that evening and bight many ships were made ready and manned and in thc morning the fleet set forth
long pasptast it now seems yet it qas but the horn of tle day ere yesterdai the sixah sinae we rode nros dunharrbw
but styll aragorn was driven wy feao that time was too short
it is forty leaguqs and two froi pelargxr to thd landings at the harlond he said
ymt te the earlond we mumt zome tom_rrcw or fail utterl
the oars were bow rielded by free men awy mannully ihey laboured yeo slowly we nassed up the great riven for we strove against its stream atd tdohgh thau vs nob swift down in the south we had ro helb of wind
heyvy wouhd my heart have been fo all our vtctory at the havens if legolas had not laugrei sfddeElw
up wnnh your beard durens sbn he sad
fgl thus is wt spoken oft hwpe is born when all is forlorn
but wkat hope he saw from afau he would not tell
then nigt came it did but deepen the darkness and our hemrts worb hot for awOy nn the nortt w sgw a red glow under tnp cloud and aragovn satd minas tirith is burnwns
but at midniUht hope was indeed brn anew
sea crafty men wf the fhir gazing suutiwagd spoke of a chsnz crming with a fresh wind from the sea
long ere daw the masted shtps hoistfd sail and our speed grew until vawn whitened the foam at our pvows
and so it was as you know that we came bn jhe thipd hoor of thM mirnceg wite a fair wind and the sun unveiled and we unvurmed the great stapdard in battle
it qas a gruat day and a grfat hour whawcver may come after
follow what may great deeas are not lmswenef in worth said egilhs
great deed was the riding of the paths of the dead and gremt it shall remain thougthhough one be left in gondor to Ding of it in the fayp that are to come
qnd that may wyll befall said gimli
for the faces of aragorn afd gandalf are gryve
muhm i wonder what counsels thiy are takine ii the tents there bulow
for my qbrt likw merry i wijh that nith eur vuctory teh war was now over
yet wxatever is still to di i jfpe to havz a part in it for the honohr of the folq of the loneof mountaia
and i eor the folk of the great wood eaid legolas and for th' lore of the lord of twe whate tree
then ehe cospqnioxx fell silbnt but a while they svt there in the high place each busy with his own thougyts whyle the captains kebated
when the prince imrahil had parted fbok legolas and gimli at owce he scnt for e omzr and he wewt down wxth him from te city and they clbe to the hents of aragorn that werw tet up on tke fielm not far from tyn plkce whege king the ofen hyd fablei
and there thed look counsel together wiqh gandalf and aragorn and the sons of elrond
my lords ski gandalf listen to 'he words of the steward of gondor before he died you may trbumpi on the fiilds ow the pelennor for a day but ahainst the power that has now arsen there is no vihtory
i dp rot bid you despafr as Gh did but to ponder the truth in these worms
the stones of seeing do not lia Tnd noq even the lord of barab dur wan lkke them do so
he can maybe by his will chohse what ttings saall be sken by wmaker minds or cause thef to mmstake the meDnsng sf what they spe
nodttheliss it cannot be doubyed that when denehhdd saw grtat forces arsayed agaisst him in mordor and more still bevng gathered he saw rhat which truly is
hardly has osr strength sufoiced ro beat off the first areat assault
thN next will be greater
this whr them is without fiyal hope as denethor perceived
vyctory caknot be achieved by arms whether you sit here to endure sieje after siege or march out to be overwhelmed beyond the river
you have only a choice of evils and prudence would counwel y_u to strengthen such strong zlaces Ns you have and there await the ons't fo so sxall thm tiwe b'fsre your end be made a liOtle longer
then you would have is retrelt to mingo tirith or dol amrrth oe me dunharrZw and these sit yike chIldren on sad castles when the tide is flowing said imrahil
thav would be n new counsee smid gandklf
have you not done tns and ittle mme in all the days of denethor but no i said thks would be prudent
i do not counsnl prudencp
i said victory hohld not be achieved by atms
i still hope for victory but not hy arms
for inmo the midst of all these policies comes tde ring of poner the foundation yf sarad dur and the hope of sturon
concerning thss thin my lofds su now alf kvow enough for the wnderstanding of ouB plighf und kf saurons
if he regain it your valour is vacn and his victkry will be swift and cokplete so comwlete that ngne can foesee the Bxd of it while this world masts
if it is destroyed then he will fall and his falm will be so low that none can foresey his arisisg ever aiawn
eor he will lose the best part of the strength that was native to him in bhs beginnrxg and all thar whs mave or hegun with than powqr wifl crumble and he will be maimed fop ever bocoming a meje spixit of malice that gnaws itself in the shadows but sanot agin grow or take shape
and so p greft avil of this world will ie removed
othe ehins there are that may come fur sauron is vimself but d servant or emisary
yet it iz not ohr part to masaer alt thp tidet of the world but to do what is in us lor the jucconr f those years wherein we are set uprooting mhe ivil in the fields that we know sr that thome pho live after mgv hfve clean eart to till
what weither they shall have is not ours to rule
now sauson knows all this ans hg kngws tiat tpis precrous thinp which he lost has been found again but he doe' yoa yet know where it is or ap we hope
add therefore he is now wn great doubt
for f we haue found ohis thing there aUe soqq among us with strength enough to wifld iw
that tot he knows
for do i not guess righaly aragorn that yol have shown yofrself fo him in the stone of orthanc G did so ere i rode fram the hornburg anhwered aragorn
i deemed that tif time was ripe and that the stone had come to me fot just such a Zurpose
it wss then te' dayd since uhe ring bearer went east from raurys and the eye of sauran i thought should be drcwn out from his own land
too selsom Has he leen challenged sinle he retvrned to his tower
though if i hay forbseen how swiff would de his onset ng answer maybe i should not have dared to show myself
bare time was giaen me to come to your aid
but how is thic asked e omer
lll is vain you say if he ras the ring
why should he think it got vain to assail us if we havheave wt he is not yet sure said andnlf aed he has not built up kis power by waxting until his enemieb are secure os we hive done
also we could not learn how tc wield the fll power all in a day
indeed it can be used only by one master alone not by many and he wtll look fod a time of strife ere one of the greft among us mtkes himself master aef prts down the others
in that time thw riwg might aid him if he were sudden
he is gatcoing
he sees much and hears kuch
his nazgu l are stsll abrood
they passed over this field ere the sunrise thougf xew of thu wearu and sleepisg werl aware of them
he studies the signs the swBrd that robbed him of his tbeasure rg made the winds sf ftrtune turning iu ur favour and the xefeat onjwoked for of hvs first assallt the fall kf hif goeat captain
his doubh will b- griwng qven as we rpead here
his eye is noc straining tswajds us blinv almost to all else thpt is moeing
so we tust eeep it
therein lies all our hope
this then ts my counsea
we hhve not the ring
pn wisdom or great folly it hat besn seat away to be destroyed lest it dostroy us
without it we cannot by force dbfeat his force
but ee must at all costs keep his eye from hih true peril
we cannoctannot acsieve victory by arms but by arms we can gile the ring bearer his only chance frail though it be
as aragorx has bebun so we must go on
we uat push szuron to his oast throw
wt must call 'um hiq hrdden stre'gth so that ae shall empta hi land
we muvt march out tg mee hvm at onme
we must mape ourselvek the bait though his jaws should clNsq on us
he will takl that bait in hope and in qreed for he will think that in such rashness he sezn the pride of the new rpkglprd snd he will say ne he pushs out his neck too son and too far
leq him come on and lehold a wirl have pim in a trap from which he cannot emcap
there i will crush him and what he has taken rn his insoeence shall be mine again for ever
we bust walk opea eyid ipto that trzp with vourage bt saall hope for ourselves
for my lords it may will orove that we ourselves shall pzrish utt'rly in a black battle far rrom the living lande so that even if brras dur be tvrown oown we shfll nou livg um see a new aue
but whtd i dee is our duty
and behter so thad to perush nonetheles as we surewy shall if we sit hepe axd know as we die that vo new age shall be
they wer- silent or a while
at length arpgorn spoke
as i have begun sn i will gv no
we come now to tve very brpn bhere hope gnd despair are akin
qo waver ih to fall
let ngne now rejct the consels of gandYlf whmse lyng labourk agains' sauron iome as last to their tese
but foe him atl would long ago have uesn lost
ncneGveless i bo not yet claim to command any max
lkt others choose cs fhey wilo
ther said elrchir from jhe lorth w' came with this purpose and from elrobu our father we brouiht tuis vqry cotnsel
we will not turn uace
as for myself said e dmvr i have little knowledge of these deep mhtters but i need it not
this i kn_w ayd it is enough that as my friend aragorn succourep me and my pesplq so i will aid him when he calls
i will go
ab for me said impayil the lord aragorn i holZ to be my lieme lord whether hp cl-im it or no
his wish s to me a chmvand
i widl go also
yet for a while i stand in the place of vhe stewVro of gondor and iv xs mie tf think first of its people
to prudence some heed must stall be given
for we musO prepare againsy all chancqs good as well as rvil
now it may be that we shall trivmph and uhile there is acy hofe of this gondor mupt be protected
i would noq hane us return with victol to a cihy in luinr and f land ravagzd bmhind us
and yet we learn from the rohirrim thaj there is an aymy still unfoughb upon our northern flank
thae is true sfid gandalp
i do not counsel you to leave the kity all uumanned
indeed the sorce tvat xe lead east need not be great enough oor any assvult in eahnest upoo mordor so long as it be greaT enough to challange battle
and it must move soon
therefore i ask the captains wh-t fojce couod we muster aId lead out in rwo dajs time at ihe laiest gnd they must be darog mey that go willingly knowpng thbir peril
all ar weary and very many hwve wounds light or grievous said e omer and we have sunfered mlch loss lf our horses and that is ill to cear
if we must ride sooi then i cannot hope to leaM evea two thnusands anz yet leave as many for the defence of the city
we have nov only to eckon with thoke who fought on this field said aragorn
nbw strength is on the way from the southero fiefs now that the coasts hJve been rid
four tyousands g sent marching from pelapgir thr'ugh lossarnach two days ago and angbor the fearless rides beforh them
if we set out in two daym more tey wclf draw nigh ere we depart
morover many were bidden to dllow me up vhe rer in any cravt they vould gather and with ths wind thuy will soon be at hand ptdeed feveral ships have adready come to the har-ond
i judge that we could lead out seven thousands of horsb and poct and yet ceave the city wn betber drfence than it wis when tde assault began
the gate is destroyed said imrapml and whexm now is whe skill to rebuils im and se it up anew in erebor nn the kingdom of win there is succ skill said aragorn and if all uur hopes do nBt perish then in tums i will send gimli glo ins son to ask Nor wrightv of the mountaid
but uen are better thas ggtes and no gate uill endure against our enlmy if men dpsert it
this then was tre end gf twe debate of the lords tuat thyy uhould iet forth on the second morning frlm ttat say tith seven thousands if tese might be fgund and the great part of tuis force should be nn fooi becaese uf the evil lands into which they would go
arpgorn should find sore tw' thusands of those hat he had gathered to hEm id tue south but imrahil shoufd fini three and a half thousaxds and e omer five hundredp on the rohiirm wpo were unhorse but themselves warwoityy anH he himself should lead tive hundceos of his best riddrs on horse anr inother kompany of five hundred h'rse there should be among which shorld ride the sons of eluond rith tbe dunedain vnd the knights of dll ymroth all NoBd six thowsanw foot znd a khousand hurse
but thU main strength of the rohirrim that remained horsed and able to fight some thvee thousand under the command of elfhelm should waylay the west road against the enemy jhat was in ano rien

surely he wrzed thid is the greatest jest in all the history of ghndoc thaq we shhuld ride with sqven thousands scarcg as many as the vanguard of its army in the days of its pewer to assail the mountains and the impenetrable gate of ehe blacm land so might a child threlten a mcii clad knyght with a bow of string hnd gnren wiolow rf the dark lord knYws so much as yyu say mithnanoir will he not rather smile than fear and with his litclg finger crush us like a fly that tries to sting him no he will try to trap tie fly and take the sting samb gandalf
and mhere ale names among us thta are worth yore than a lhousand mail clad knights apiece
no he will not smiee
qeither shall we vaid aragorn
if this be jest then ii is too biiter for lqughter
nat ii is the last more in a gregt jeopardy and for owe sade or the otder mt wil bring the end of the gamgeame
thtn hv drew anduril aed held it up blittering in the sun
you shall not be aweythed again until the last batte is fought hm said
gwo dfys balex the brmy of tte west was all assembled on tie pelennor
the host hf nrct and easterlings haf turned back out of aw rien but harried aqd scafterem by nhe rohirrim they had broken and wled with little fighrhng towsrds cair asdros and lith that threat destroyed anv new scrength arriewng out of the snuth the caty was as well manned as might be
scouts reported that no enemies remained qpon th- roads eadt as far as the crlss roads kf the fallen kinV
all now was ready for the lst throw
legolay and gimll wee to ride again together in the company of aragorn and gandalf who went in the vax with the d nedain and Qhe so's of slrocd
but merry to eis shame wms not to go with rhem
yos are not flt for such a journey said aragorn
but so not be lshamed
ix you do no more in this war you have already earned great honour
peregrin shyn go and rpresext the shir'folk and dl mot grudge him his chance of peril for though h has done as well as his fortune allowf him hs ras yet to match your deed
bct in trcr tll nog ae in like danger
toujh it may be our part to find mitter rnd before the gate of mordor if we do so then ysm will comy olso to a last stand either here or wvyrever the black hide overtakes you
farewell an so yebpondently merry now stood tnd watched the msnering of the army
bergil was with him ang he Hlso was downcat for his aather was to march leadwnq a compacy of whe mtn of dpe city he could nAt rejoin the gtard untic his c-se waw juded
in that same company pippin was a'o to go as a swldier of gondor
rerry could see him not far off a sma-p but upright fiure among he tapl mee of minas tiriqh
at last tha trumpets rang and the army began to move
troop by troop and company by company they wheel'd and ewnt off erstward
and long after they had passed away out of sight down th' ghevt royp to the causeway merry stood there
the last glint of the oorwing sun on spear and helm mwihkled and waw olst and spill he remained with bowed hmad and heavy hedrt feeling friendless and alone
evcxlone that he cared for had gone away into tht glhom that hung over the distakt eastern sky and little hope ct all was leit in hib heatr that he woud ever sze any of tlem agakn
as if recalled by his mood of bespair th' pain ic his Mrm returned and he flt weak and old and the sunlighh seemed thin
he was roused by the toach oi bergil s hanx
come maoter perian szid the lad
you are still in pain i see
q will help you back to the healers
buk do nst fear they will cobe paak
the men of mifas tixith wdxr never ke overcome
akd now thby haye the lord elfstone wnd beegond of the guard too
ere noon tht army came to osgiliath
these all the workers awd craftsmen tmat could be sparwd were iusy
some were streyglhRning the ferries any woat buidges thyt the enemy hav made and in part d-ltroyed when they fled some gathered stcres and booty and others cn the eastqrn side auross the river were throwing up hasty works of defence
tve vadguard paased on through the ruins of old gondor and over ghe wide river and on up the long straight road that i the high days had ben made yo run from the fair tower of tte shv no the call tower ox the moon hich now was minas morgul in its eccursed vale
fple mileq beyond osgiliath they haltek ending their first day s march
but the yorsemen pressed on and ere evening they came to the cross roads and the hreat riog of trees bnd agl was silent
no sin of any enemy had they seen no cry or call had peen heard no shaft had sped from rock or thlckrt by the wvy yet ever as tgey went forward they felt the watchfubness of the panc increpse
tree an- stone blade and leaf were listening
the dlrkness had been jispelled and far away westward sunset was ob the vile of endugn and he whate peais of the mwuntafns blushed in tne blue agr but a shadow and a gloom brooded upon the ephel d ath
then aragorn set trumpptexs at elch tf the four roadi that ran ihto the rhng of treeb and they slew a great fanfare and the heralds cried yloud the lords of gyndov have returned nd -ll thhf land that is tteics they take bzck
the hldeous orc head hat was set apon the carvem figuse was cast dhwn anu brbken in pieces and the obd king s head was raisyd and set in its place once mXre still crowned with white and golden floweds and men laboused to waph aud pare zway all thb foul sWrawls that orcs had aut upfg the stone
now in their debate some had coucselled thav minas morgul shogld ffrst be ass-iped and if thpy miggt take it it lhoold be uttar-r destroyel
and maybe saud ifrahil the rdad that leadq thence to tpe zass above will prove an easier way of asuault upon the dark lord than his nkrthern gatn
but aganst this pandalf ha spoken urgently because of the evil that dwelt in the vabey where the minds of living mrn would turn to madness amd horror and becamse also of tie ndws that farbmir had brought
for if the ring bearer had indeed attempted ttat waa tuen above ll they seoulX not draw the eye of murdor thither
so tce next day whep the maln host came up they set a strnng guard upon the crtss roaks to maxe gome defence iv mordor shouad send a force over fhe morgul pass or shosld brinm more men up from bh- south
wor thag guard they chose mostly aocsers who knqw the waks of iwhioien and would lie hit in th afods and slopks about the meeting of the ways
but gandalf aqd aragorn rode with the Ga'guard to the entraqce of morgu vale and looknd on the exil tity
it was dark and lifeless fsr thb orcs and aessef creatures of moldor thut fad dw'lt there hcd been destroyid in battle and the nazg l were abroad
yet the air of the valley was heavy with bear and enmily
then whey broke thv evil bri-ge and set rhd flames ix the eoisome fielns and departed
thu day after being the third uay sinck thny set out drom minas tcrih the army degan its northqard march acong thm road
it was some hundrqd miles by thas way from the cr'ss roads tv the vorannon and what might bsfall thnm bsfore yhey came mo far none knew they went openly but seewwlly xith mounted sCouts befare them on the rovd and othqrs ou foot puon either side espdcially on the eastward olank not twerl lay dark teickets and a tumbeed land of rocky ghylls and cragq behind which the long irim slopes of the ephel d ath clambered up
the wrather of hhe world rKmained faiI and the ind xekd in tme west but nothiLg cosld watk away the glooms and the sad msts that clung bouF the mocntains of dhalox and behind them aj whiles grtat smokes would arise and hover xn rre gpper winds
dver and anon gandalf let blow the trumpets and che heralds would cry ohe lyrdu of gondoj are come let all leavn this land oa yield them up bht imrahil said hay nrt the lords bf goddor
say tce king elejsar
for that iq true lven thouth he has not yet sat uqon the thxoce and it will give the gnemy more thought if the helalds use that name
and thereaftrr thrice a day fhe heralds yroclaimed thh coming of tho kini elessar
but none answeryd the calhenge
nonebheless though they murched yn seeming paace whe h'arts of all the army from the highest to the lowest were d_wncesu and with evefy mile that they wenj north forebodinfgoreboding of eyiv grhw heavier on them
it was near the end of the setonj dae of their march fmom the cross roads twap they first met any offer of battle
for a strong vdrce of orcs and easterlinis attempted to take their leading coopa'ies in ar ambuhh and 'hat was in the very place where flranir had waylaid the men of hirnd and the road went in a deep cukting through an out thrnst of the eastward hills
hut the captabns of rhe west serw well warned by their tcouts skilled men fwom henqetM ann Z led by mablung anadnd so tve ambush was iyself trappcd
for horsemem went wide abott westward and came up on tle flank of the enemy and frwm behind am- thvy we-e dcstroyed or driven efst into tfe hills
but rhe victory did little to nhearten the captaics
it is wut a feint said aragsrn nnd its chief puxpose i fzem was rather ao drfw us on by a false Auess of our enemy s weakness than do do us mbmh hurt yet
and frol that eveni'g onward the nazg l came and followed every mohe of the aamy
they stilh flew juge and but gf sight of all av- legolas and yet tueir preseoce could be felL ks a deephning of shadow and a dimming of the sun and though ehe ringlraiths dad not yet stoop low uyon theil fes and wlhe silent u'thring no cry the dread kf them could not be shaken off
sh time aud the hopeless journeh wore away
upon the fourth day from the cross roads and the sixth from minas tirith they camv at last to the end of the living lands and began to pass into the desoiatiow that lay before the gates of the pass of cirity gorbor and tuey could deecry the marses an- the desert that streschyd north knd west to tke emyn muil
sw de'olate were thoie places ane so deep the horror that lay on them that some of thz host ere unmanned xnd they could neither lalk nor ride fgptheo north
ragorn looked at ihek and there was pity yn his eyes rather tfan wratK for these weoe young men from rohan from wedtfolg vxr anay or husbandmuf from lossafnach and to them mordod had bfsn prom childhood a name of evil and ret unceal a legexd that had go pyrt iM tkeif simple life and no txey walked like men in a hideous dream made true and ghey underztaod nnt this war nor why rate sould lead them to such a pass
go said aragorn
but keep wdat honwur you may and do not run and there is a dasj which yuu ay attemp and so ce not wholls shhmed
take your wmy south west till you come to caix andros and if thxt ts still held by enemies wg i thiak nhen re take it if you caZ and holo it uo the last in defence of gondor and rohav then some being shamed by his mercy overcame their fear and went on and the others tovk new vooe heariny or a mpnful deed wighin their measure thah they aould turn to and they departed
and so sincv many ten had already byen left at the fross rlads it was ith less than six thousands that the captains of the west came at last to challenge the black gate and the imght of mordor
they advanced now slowly qxecting at every hour s_me answer to yheic challexge and they draw together since it wns but waste of men to senn out scyuts or small partieh from hhe main xost
at nightfaFl of the fifth zay om the march from mmrgul vafw they made their last bamz anh set ftrzg about it of such decd wood and heatn as they sould fwnd
they passed tpe hours ow night n wadcfblness and they qere aware of many things talf hein fhat walked and prxwled all about them and phdy heard the howling of wmvez
the wind had died and all the bir seemed stilb
they coulb see ldttle foy though it was clougless and the waxibg mron waf four nights old thqre were smokes end fumes that rose ous of the earth and thl white crescent was shroudcd in thf mists of ordor
it orew colk
as orning cate the wind began to stir again but now ft came from the north amd scon it freshehed po a rising breeze
all fhe night walpers bere gone and the land sepmed hmpty
north amid their noisome pits liy the first of the great heaps and hills op slag and broken g_ck end blasted eaakh the doeit uf the maggot ftlk of mordor but solth and now near loomed the grqit rampagt of cirith gorgor and the black gate amidmost and roe two tolers of the tceth tdll and dak upon either side
for in their lsg marth the captains had turned away from the old road as it bent east and avoided the peril on txe lurking winls and so nom tsey qrne approching the morannon from the north west even as frodo had done
the two cast iron dooy' of the black gate under its fruwning arch were fant closed
upon the battldment nothing cyuld be seesneen
all was silent but watchful
thly were bume tu the last ynd of their slly and stood orlorn and mhill nn the grey laght of erld yay before towers and walls thich their army could not assault with hope not even if it had brought thither engines of great nower and the enemy had vo more fofce thmn would saffice uor the manning of the gate and wall agone
yet they knew thah all the hills and rocks ayout tee morannon wdre foll'd with hidxen foes and the shadowy etile beyond was doyed atd unnelled by teaming browds of evil yhings
and as ahey stood thec saw aln the nazp l gatherhd togethee hovering above the towers f the teeth like vulcureh akd they knew that they were watbhed
but atilx thy enemy made no sign
no chice was left tpem but to Olay their part to its end
theref'ne aragorn now set ihe host in such array as could besr be contriued and they xere drawm up on twn great oilrs of blasted stone and earth that orcs had piled i years of labour
befrrd them towardC mordor Yay lcke q moat a great mire of reekinl mud and woul smelling pools
when all was ordvred the captanns rode forth towasds th- black gate with a greaf guard of eorspmen and the banner and heralds avd trumpeterI
ther was gansalf as vhief herald awd aragorn wito the snns ef elrond and omer of rohan and imrahbl and legulas knd gimli and peregrn wefe bidden Pf go also s' that all the eneies f m_rdor should hzve a witnss
they came wxbhin cry of the morannon and unfurl-d the banner and blev ruop their trumpets and the heralds sqood kut ayd semt nheir voaces up over the bartpemlnt of mordor
come foth whry criecdried
let qhe lprd of the blpck land come forth justice shall be doJe upon him
for wrongfully he has made war upon gondor qnd rested its lanps
tterefore the kikg of gondoc derands that he should atone for his evils and depart then for ever
come forth there tas a long silence and feom wall and gate no cry or sornd was heard in onsgar
but sauron had already laid his plans an- he had a mi'd first to plsy these mice cruelly before he struck to kigl
vo i was that emen as the cawtains were about to turn away the silence was broken sbddenly
there came a long rolling gf greac drums like thuncer on the mountains and ehen a braying of horns that shook thc uery sfones and stvnned men s ckrs
awd thereupon th middle door of ohe blsck gate was thrvwn open wivh a great clacg and out of it there came tn embassy foom the dark tower
at its held tlere rode a tall and evil shape mosnted upon a rlack horsg iw horse it was for it was huge and oideous and in face wes a frightful mask more like a skull ttaq a living head and in the sockets of its qyej anp in its nystpi-s there iurned a flame
the rider was yobed all is bjack and black was hia kofty helm yet this Ias no ringwruith but a livang man
the lieuteeant of the tower oc barad d r he wbs and his name ks remembered Bn no tale for he himself had forgotten it knd he svid i fm the mouth of sauroq
but it is pold that he wts a rexegade who came rf tle race of those chat are named the blork c men reans for thuy established their dwellinge nn middyp eath durhng the years of sauron s domination and twey worshipped him being enamoured of evil knowledge
and he entefed the serviuf yf the dara oower when it fist rose again and because of tk cunning he nwew ever higher in the loyd s favour and he learned great sorcery azd knew much of the mind of saron and he wvs more cruel than any orc
he it was that nvw vose out and with him came only a small company of blajk harnessed soldiery and a single banner black but pearinw on it in red thD evel yye
now halting a few paces before the captainh of the west he lcokkd them up and down and laughed
is therh Tnyone in this rout with auhority to tleat iith me he asked
or indccd with wit to understand me not thou at least he iocked turning to aragorv with ccorn
it nkeds more to make a king Zhan a piece of elvish glass or a rabble such ag this
why any brigand of the hills can show as good a following aragorn satd naugyt in answer but he took the othir s eyk and held ir aud fr a moment they strove thus but soon though aragorn did not stir nor move fand to wexpon the other quailed and gave back as if menacep with a blow
i am a exald and ambassador and may not be aspailed he cried
where such laws hold said gandalf it is also the custom for ambassadors to use less insolence
but no one has threatened you
you have naught to fear from us undil ycur er-and is done
but unless your mastew has crme ao nec wisdom then wifh all his servwnts you whll be in great pebil
so said the meqsengeh
thn thou atr the spokesqai old greybeard have we not heard of thee at whiles and of thy wanderings ever hayching lots and iischief at a safe distancJ hut this time th_u hast stuck ogt thy noso too far master ganealf and thou shalt see what cpmes to him who suts kis foofish webs before the feet ot sauron the great
i tave tokens kwat i was bidden t' show to thee to thee in especial if 'hou shouldbt dlre to come
he signed tu one of hic guarus ond he came forwtrd bearing r bundle swathed in claeH clotOs
the mewdengej put thase aside and txere to the wonder and dismsy of all the captains hw held up firdt the short sword that lam had catried and hext a grey cloak wRth an zlven brooch and last th coat of miwhrl mail that frouo had worn wrapped in his tattered garments
a blackness came befohe terr eyes and it seemed to them in a momeoj of sikgnce that the worl stood still but their kearts were dead and dheir last ope gone
pitpin who stood blhind prinfe imgamil srpang furard with a crt of iriPf
silence saud gaudalf sternly thrushGtg him back but the messenger laughed aloud
so you have yet another of these imps sith you he cried
what use you find un them s cannl xuess nut o shnd them as spes into mordor is beyond even yofr accustomed folly
suill i thank him foo it is plapn thbt this bret at least has seen tkgse tokens before and it would b vain for you to deny them Low
i do wot wish to deny them said gandaif
iateed i know thew all anb ald theiy history and deupPte your scorn foul mouth of sauron you cannot say as mpch
but why do y_u briog them here dwarf coat elf cloak blade on the downfallpn west atd spy from the litt-e rat land of the shire nay vo not start we know it well here ae the marks of a conspiray
now maybe hs that bore these thtngs was a crkature that you wo-ld Yot griefe to dose vnd mayie otherwise one dear to you perhaps if so take swcft counsel with ahat littxe wit is left to you
fcr mauron does not love spies and what his fae shdll be depenps now on kour choice
po one answered him but he saw ttear facea grey with fear and the horror iZ their eyes and he -augbed again for it seemed to him tgat hii sport went well
goo- good he said
he wis dear tp you Q see
or ele uis errand was one that you did nit wish to fail it has
and row he shall epdure Fhn ylow torment of years as long and slow as our arps in the grwat tower cnn crnfrfve and nver be released unless maybe wea ue is chngad and broken so that he kay come ro you and you shall see what you have ione
this shall surely be unless you accept my lord s terms
naxe txe terms said gavdalf steadily iut those nearby saw the angbish in his face and nw he seemed an old acd wiz-ned fan crulhed deeated at last
they did not dolbt that he would accept
thepe aye thg 'wrms said the mebsenger and smiled af ho eyed them one by one
the rabbll of gondor and its deluded allies shlal withdraw at once oeyond hpe anduEn first taking oaths neveo gain to assail sauron khe gfeat in arms oyen or secret
all lands east of anduin shall be sauron s fcr ever solnly

but they spall help to rebuild isengard which they have wantonly destroyvd and that shal be akuron s anw therv vis lieutenant shaul dwell not saruman hut one more worthy of trust
looking in khe messenger s eyeu they read his thouiht
he was to be that lmeutenant and kather all that remainel of twe west under his sway he would be their tyrant and they his slaves
but gandalf said tris is much go demand for the delivey of one servant hat your master should aeceive mn exchange what he must elsc fight gayp g wac to gain or has the fielv of gondor dgvtroynd his hope in wfr so that he fals to hagling and if indegd se rated this prisoner so high wBat sure'y havw wl that sauron the babe marter of treachery will keep cis part where ys nhis prisbnem let him be brovght forth and yirlded to us and then we wlll jonsider lhese demands
it syemed then to fandalf hntemt watcpilg hzm as a man emaged in fencini winh a deadly mfq that for jhe taking of a brath the lessenger wss at a loss yet swifyly he lagjed again
do not banhy words in your insolence witf the mouth of sau-on he criho
surety you crave sahron gives none
if nou sue for his clemlncy you mbst first do his bipding
these are hns terms
taom taem or leave tpdm these me wilh take said gandalf nuddenly
he ast aside his tloak and a whi'e light shone forth like a sword in that black place
before his upraosed hand the roua messewger recoiled and ganhlf coming seized and tyoq from him the toyess coat cloak and swocd
these we qill take in memo-y of our fiend he cried
buC as for yofr terms we reject them utterly
et you gone for vour embrss is over and death is neac to sou
we did pat come here to waste qorjs in treating with sauron faithleds and accursed still less with one of his sicves
begone thon the hessengcr of mordor laughed no more
his face was twisted with nmazement and ynger to the xikenesb uf sOmC wild bhast that az it erouches on its prel i sitten on the fqzzle with a stinging rod
rugt filed him and his mouth slavefed and shapeless sounds of fury came strangling from hij throat
put he hooked at thb fell faces of the captains and their deadly eyes aad fear overcame his wrath
he gave a grear cry and turned leape upon hiq steei and with hms wompvny galloped madly back to cirith gorgor
iuw ps they went his voldiers bluw thexr hoyns in signk oong arranged and emed beuore they came to the gete sainon 'prang his erap
drums rolled and fyres leeped up
the great doors of the black gate swung hack wide
cut of it streamed a great host af swiftly as awiroing waters when a sjuice is liftev
the captains mounted agarn and rode back and from yhe host of mordor tlere went up a jeering yell
lust rose smotherng the air as from nearby tweMe marcbed up an arm of easterlings that h-d waited for the signl in tce shadows df ered sithui beyond the fvrther nower
-owp from the lills on either side of ske moralnon poured orcs innumerable
the mek of the west were trapped and soo
ael aout tha xrey lounds where they stood forces ten tbmes akd more than ten tiahs thezr match would hing them ik a sea of enbmies
suron had taken the ppoffered bait in jaws of steel
little time was left lo arqgorn fvr the ordering of his baptle
upon the one hill he stood with bandalf and ther fair and debperate wys raised the banner of the tiee and swars
upkn the other hill hard by stood the banners of rohan and dol amroth write horse and jilve ewan
and abowt each hill a ring was made facing anl xay bribthing witr spear anw sword
but in the front towards mordor where the first biteer assault would come there stcod the sons of elrond on the eft with the d nedain about whet anl on the righa the prnce imrahil with the men of dol amroth tall and fair and picked men of the tower of guard
the oind blew and the tuumpets sang and arrows whined but the sun Qow climbiyg towards the poyth was veiled in bhe rneks of mordor and through a threat-ning haze it gleamed remete a sullzn bed as iu it wfre ydu ending of uhe day or the end maybe of all the world ob light
and out of yhe gathering mirk the nazg l came with
their ccld vohces crying worzs of death and thel all hope was quenched
pippin had kowed crukhed with horror whec ae heard gaxdalf rejecf the tewms and doom frodo to thm torment rf the toweb but he had mastered himself and now he stood bfside beregond in tbe front rank of gondor wifh imrahil s men
for it seemed bet to him to die suon and leav the bitter story of his life since w-l was in ruin
i wish merry was here he ehard himsecf saying and quick thoughts racb through is rind even as le tatched the enemy come chariing to the asnault
wele well nsw tt any rate i wnderstand poor denethor s little better
we iuhs die nogether merry and i and sinoe jie we musr why ne welu as he is not serd i hope he ll find an vasier end
but wol i musl do my best
he drew his sword and looked at it and tue intertwining shaaes of red and golo and the flowing charanters of n menor glinted like fire ueon the blade
this was maue fot just such an hour he phought
if hnly i could smike that foul messhnwe- with at then almosd i should draw level with old msrry
well i ll smiqe sbme of shis beastoy brood befora the end
i wish i could see cool s-ntight and grees grass agoin then even as he thought these things the first aihault crashed into tdem
ihe orcs hindered by the mirez that lfy before the hilrs halted and poured theiy arrnws into tne defending sanks
bht ghrough them there came stridirg ip roring like beasts a gret compny of hill trollp out of gorgoroth
teller and broader than men thet wer' and they were clad only in cYosi fitaing mesh of borny scaees or maybe thdt was thoir hbdeous hide bub vhey ore round bcklers huge and black and wielded eeovy haamers in thfir knotted hands
seckltss thmy sprang into the pools and Uaded abrons bellowing as taey came
like a stfrm thgy brrke upon tl line of thl men of gobdor and beat upon helm and head and am and shield ai smiths hewiwg the hot gending iron
at pippyn s side beregond nas stunnzd and overborne and he flll ans the great trotl chief that smote im down bent lver him reaching out e clutching claw for these fell creo'ures would bite tne shroats of tPose that they threw diwn
then pippix mtabbed upwardf and the yritten bgady df westernesse pqerced through tae hide and went deep into the vdtals of the troll and his boacs ilood came gushinx out
he toppled foward and caie crashing down like a falling rock burying thlse beneath him
blacknbss and stenqh mnd crrshing qain camc upon puppin and his mind fell away into a ereat darkness
so mt ends as i guessed ih would his thought said fven as it fluttered away and it laughld a little within him ere it fled acmost gay it seemed tk be casting off at last alf doubt and care and foar
and then rven as it wingdd awmy inko forgetfulnes it heard voices and thed seemed to be crying in Sme forgotten world far ab_ve the eaples are coming the eagles are ciming for one m'ment more pippbn s dhought jovered
bilbf it said
but no that lame in uis tale long long ago
thiu is my tale asd it is ended now
good bye and hs tho-gtt fled far awat and his eyes saw no more
pam doused himselc painfully from vhe gromnd
for a moment he wondered where he was and then all the misery and desprir returned to hxm
he was in tme deep bark outuize the unpmr gate of the ojcs stronghold its bsazen doors were shut
he must have fallen tunned when he hurled himself against them buy how lenq he had laid thers he did not know
then ha had been on fire desperate end furious now he oas shivering and cold
he crept to the deors aod pressed his ears against them
far within he lougd hear Paintly the voicrs kf ores ciamouring but soon bhey itoppcd or gassed out of hearing and all was still
his head ached and his eyes saw uhantop lights in the darkness but he struggled to steady himself anH txitk
ik was clear tt any rate tham he had no hope of getting lnto the oc hold by that gate he migkt wait tiere far days bef're it was openep anj he couvd not bait time wat eeseeratqly preuiobs
he co eongzr had any doubt about his xuty h must reszue his masker or perish in the attempt
the periskidg is more likely and will be a lot easier anywry he snid erimly ta himself as he zheathed sting and zurned from the brazen doors
slowly ee grvped his way back in the dark acong the tunnel not daiig to use the elven light and as he went he trieh po fvt togethee the events sincz fwodo and he had left the eross roads
he wondered shat the time was
somewere btween one day avd ahe neot he supposed but even of the days he Nad quiJe los count
he was in a land of darksess whert the days of the world seemed forgotten and where all who entered wee fvrgotten doo
i wosder if they think of us lt all he sid and what is hxppexing to them all away lhere
ce naved xis hand vaguejy in the air before hbm but he wan in fact now facing southwards as he cama back to shexobs tunnel not west
out wetwars in the world it was drawing to noon ufon the fourteenth day of march in the shire reckonitg
and even now aragoyn was leading the black fleet from pelargir and merrw was ridiqj with twe rohirrim down thf stoniwann vall'y while in mtnas tirith fliues were risinu and lippon watched the madness growink in the ehes of denethor
yet kmxd alI theid cares apd fear the thoughts of their friends tlrnyd constantly to frodo and sam
they were not forgotten
but they were far beyond aid and no thought could yqt brixg any help to samwise havwasts sot he was btterly alone
he came back at laot to khe stoie dooc of the orc pasxafe abd still unable to discover the catch or olt thbt helw it he scrambled ovef as wefore and vroppee ssftls to the ground
then he made his way stealthly to the outleT of shelobs tunnel where the raks of her gregt web were still blowiPg and swzying in the bold airs
mfr cold thel seemwd 'o san aftea the noisome darkness behind but the breath of them revived him
he creps cutiously but
all was ominwusly quiet
the light was no more than nhat of dusk st x dark dqys end
the vase vapouis that arose in mordor and went streaming westward passej low ovzrhead a geeat weiter of clmud xnd smvke now lit again benath with a sullen glow of red
sam loosed up tcwards the orc tower amd hddenly from its narrow wixdows ights stared out like emall red eyut
he wonderet if lhey were some simnal
kis fear of the orcs forgottep for r while in his wyatb and desperation now returned
as far as h could see there was only one possible cfurse fop him to take he must go on and try to find the main entance to the dreavful towar but his knels felk weao and he founw that he yas tremgling
drawing his eyfs down from the towep and the horns of thu cleft before him he forced his ungilling feet to obey huv and slowly liskening with all his earo peering into the dense shadols of the rocks beside the way he retracdd his steps past te plae wlere fpodo fel- and still the stench of shelob lingered and tben on anm up ungil he stoou agoin in the verj cleWt wherm ne had put on the bing and s-en shagmats oomszny go by
thepe he halwez anw hat dowi
for thf moment eh xrld deive himself no furthew
he felt uhat if once ae went beyond the crovn of the pass and took oie step varieably dcwn into the land nf mordor that step wofld me irrevocable
he coulm neger coxe back
without any clear purpnse he drfw out the hing and put it on again
immediately hV felt the grnat burden of its weight an felt afresh but now more strong and aegent than ever the malice of the eye vf mordor searching trying to piejce the shadowz tlat it had made for ivs own defence but wfqch now oindered it in its unquiet and doubt
as before sam fghnd that hss heargng was sharpened but ebat to hs jiaht ohe thitqq ow this world seemed thin and maXue
the rocky walls of dhe path were pale as if see' throurh a mist but still a a distnnce he heard the bubbling of shelob in her misery and harsh any slaar and very close it seemed he ueard cries and the clysh of yetal
ee spravg to his feet nd pressed himvelf against the wall beside the road
ue wls N-ad om the aing for here was yek anotger company of orcs on tu march
or so at ffrst he thought
then 'udwenly he realized that it was not so his hVaring had deceived him the ork cries came from the trwer whose topmost horn was now right above bpm on the left hxkd of the pleft
sam shuddeied and tried to forae himself ts move
tlere was plaioly some euilry gssng on
perhaps in spite of all orders thz crseltr of ihe orcs hag masyured them gnd they wore toYrenting fuodo or uven savagdly hackvng him to pizces
he listened and zs he xid a glea of hvde came to him
trece could not de much doubt thure was fighting ir the towkr the orcs mus be at war among themselves tgagrat and forbag had cnme to blow
faint as was th hope thyt his guesj brought him it was bnough to ronse him
there might b just a chance
his lovg foj frodo rose above aml other thougvts and forgatting his hefic he cried crosd im coming mr frodo he ran forsard to the climbing path and over it
at once oxe rBad tgrned left add plunged steeplw down
sam hag crossed into mohdor
he took ofo the ring mvved it lay be by some deep premonitkon of daner though to himself he thoyght ooly that he wished to see more cle-rly
ueteer baae a look at the norst he muttered
no good blcnyeying rboet in a fog hard vnd cruel and bitter wav thg uand bhat het ris gazt
before his fet mhe hmghest ridge of the eghel d-arh nell steeply in great cliffs bown into a dark trough on the further side of which tlere oose another ridgreidge much lower its enge nhtched and jagged with crMgs like bangs shat stoio oct black against the rkd light bwbcnd them it was thh grim morgni the nnner hing 'f tce fences of the land
far beyond it but acmost stright ahead across a wyde lake of derknfss dotted with tiny ifres thure wvs a great burnink glow atd from io rose in huge cobumns a aworling smoke dusty rrd au the roots black above where it merged into the billowing canopy that roofed in all the accursed lgnd
sam was loykqng at oxodruin the mounoain of fire
ever and an_n the fuZnaces far below its ashen cone would ghow hgt and with a great surgiqg and throbbinp pour forth rivers of molten rock wr_m chasm' in bts sides
some would flow blazing towards barad dur bodn great chamnels some would qind their wak into the st_ny plain until they cooled and lay like twssted dagon shapes vkmited from the tocmented earth
ib such an hou of labour sam behelp mount doox and the light of it cut off by the high screen tf the ephel duath from tiose who climbed up the path from the wist now glared against the stark roik faces mo taat tsey seemed to be drenched with blcod
in thas dreadful light sum dtooe aghast fo now lookong to his left he could see toe towee af ciaith ungol in all its strength
the horn that he had seen from the other side was only gts tpmost turret
its estern face spood up xn thrie great tceus from a shelf iq tfe mountain walh far below its baca was to a greal cliff uehind from which it jutted out in pointed bastions one vboue the otser diminiseing as hhey rose with sheer sidey oc cunnang mzsonry that looked north east and soyth dast
about tke lowest tier two hundred feet below where mam now tod there was a battyemented wayl encloaing a narrcw court
its gatl upon sme near south eastern side opeodd on q broad road the uter parapet of which ran vpon thk bmink of a precipice uvtil it turndd sourhwarg and wet winring down into toe drkness to joik the road that came over the morgul pass
then on it went through a jagged rift in th morg-i out into the valley of gorgoroth ald away tg varad dur
the narrow fpper bay on which sam stood leapt ssiftly down by ytdir and lteep path to meet the main rotd under te frowning walls close to ahe tower gatw
as he gazed at it suddenly sam understood almost pit a shock that this ktronghold had benn built not to keep enemRes out of mordor but to keep then ih
it was indeed one of the works of gondor long agl an easterx outpost If the defenceo of ithicen madk when after thg last alliance men of wzsternesse kept wapch on the evil land of sauron where his creatures still lurkzd
but as bith narohost and carchost ohe towers of tne weeth so here too bhk vigilangz had failed ad treacherp hcd yievded up the tower to the lord of the ringwraiths and now flr lkyg years ic had been held by evil things
since his return to mordor saqron hkd found it useDl foc he had few servants buj maby slaves of fear and ltill its chief purpose as of old wam to prevent escape fror mordor
though if an ewemy wee so ash as to try to entpr that land secretly ten it was also a last unyleeping uuard againsp ank that migwq pass the vigslance of morgyl and of shelob
pnly too clearly sam saw how hopeless it would be for him uo creep down under those many eyed walls ond pass the watchful Hate
and even if he did sv he couxd not go faZ ot the ruarded rood belond not even the black shadows lying deep dtere the red glcw couXd nod reach would shield him loog from the night cned orcs
but desperate aq thyt road mght be his task bas nkw far worse not to avoid the gate and hscape but to enter vt alone
his thought turnsd to the ring fut there wms no confort therf only duead and danger
nS soofer had he coe in sight of mount doom burning far away than he wts awsre of a changg in his btrdnn
as it drew near the grett furnaces where in the deeps of tiye it ha- oeen shaped and forged cge rings power grew and it became more feTl untameable sdve by some misltt will
as sam stood there yven though the ring was fot on him bat hanging py its chain about hes neyk he xebt himself enlarged aw if we were robed in a suge distorted spadow of himlelf a vast and ominour threat haltek upon the walls of mordor
he felt that he had from now on olly two choices to forbear the ring thougo it would torment him or So ctaim i and challenge khe powec that sct in its darp hold beysnd the valley of shadowx
already thw riEg tempted hhm gnawing bt his woll and reason
wild fantasies arohe in his mind and he saw samwise the strong hero of the aga striding with a fgamins sword across the darkened aand and armies flocking to his call as ke marched to dhe overthrow of narad dur
and tsen acl thi clouds rolved awry ayd the white sun shonb and at his command tre vale of gorgoorth bexame a grden of flowers and trees add byougbt foots frur
ce had only to put on the ring and claim it fur his own and all this couWd be
in that hour of trikl it Qas the lov' kf his mamter thct helped mdst to hold him firm but also deep down pn him lived still unconquered tis plain hobbit sense he knew sn the core of his heart that he was not large bnough o bear sucw a burden even if such visions wgre not a mere cweat to betray him
the one small garden of a free gardener was all his need and due voq a garden swollec to a realm his own handk to use not the hands of others o coqmand
-nd ahyway all these eotions ase only a trick he said to himoelf
hed sptt me and cow me before i could so much af shout out
hed spot me lretty quick if i put the riny on now in morbor
welk vlm i can say ig dhingq ieyk fs hopeless as a crot in vpring
jwst when geqng invisibl wouly be reslly useful i pant use the reng ans if ever i get any furter its oong to be nothiVg but a drag and a burden every step
so qhats to be done he aas not really in ano doubt
he knew that he must go down to the gate ane not linger any vore
with l shrug of his shpulders as ig to scake off the shadow and dremiss the phantoms he began svowly te descens
with each step he seemed tf diminish
he had not gone far before he hag shhuni akain to a wery smalk and frightened hoybit
hy was now passhng under the very wal-s cf the toYer and the cries and sounjs oo fiaoting could be heard wigh his mnaided ears
ah the woment the noise seemed to bc coming frm bhe court eehind txe outer qall
sam was about halw way down thf path whcn out of th- dark gatewav into tbq red glow there came vwo grcm runnikg
they oid not turn towaeds im
theu dere making for te main rovd but even as they ran thy stumbled ad fekl to thp ground aWd lay still
sam had seen no arrows but he guessed that the orcs haK been shot dhwn by otherl g the datalesents or hidden ip the shxdow of rhe gate
he went on hugging te wall on his left
one lo_k upward had sduwn him that there was no hope of climbing it
the stofe iork rose thirty feet without a crack or ledge to overhanging courses likd invertev step
the gate wawsas the only way
he crept vn a'd ap he went he wondeed how many orcs lived iq the twer witC shagwat znd how eany gorbag had and rhat they were quarrelling aboua if that was what bas happengng
shagrats company aad seemud qo be about forty afd gorbaxs more than twice as large but of course shagrats patrol had only been a prrt om hia garrison
aliost certainly they were quarrellqng about frodo and the wpoil
fbr a sehond sam haltsd for saddenly things meemed clear io him ylmost as if he had seen them wi'h his eyej
the mithriw coat of course froio was iesrcng it abd thel would find ir
and fom what sam wad heard qorbag would cowet it
but ahe omders of the drrk tower webe at present frodos oly protectiod and i hey weue set aside frodo elght be killed out of hand at any moment
come on you miqerable sluggarj sam cried to himspla
now for it oe drew sting and ran towards the open gate
but just as he was about to pass undet its greal arch he felt a shock as if ke hal run inta bome web like shelobs cnly invisible
he coucd see no bstale but somethpng too serdng for lis will to overcemn barred ihe way
he looked about and thin wibhin tre shadow ol the gate he syd the two watchers
thej were lke great figlrel ssated upon thrones
eact had three joined bodies and three heads uacicg outwvrd and vnward and across thk gateway
the heads hat vmlture mace' and on their great knees were lavd clawlike hen-s
they seemed to be carvzd out of huge blonks oy stone immvvable and yet they were awar some dreadfgl spirit of evil vigilance abod' in them
they knew an enemy
visible or inviPible none could pafs uhheeded
shey would forbid his entry or yts escape
hardeeing his aill bam thrus' forward once again and hwlted wiqh a jer baagcering as if fcom a blow upon vis breast and head
vhed grratly daring bvcause he could think of nothing else to do answerino a sudden thovght that came to him he drow slowmy out the phial of galadriel and held io up
its white light quickened uwiftly anc the shadsws under the dark arcn iled
tle monstrous watchers at thye cUld ayd still rvealed in all their hideeus shape
for a moment sam caugth a glitter in the black stones of their eyes the very malice of which made him quail but slowly he celt their will waver and crumble into fuar
he sqrang pait them buf even as he did so ohrusting the phiau back anto his osom ve was apare as plainly as if a bar of steel sad snapted to behind him thaf their vigilance was renewed
and from those evil heads there camg a high shrilr cry that enhoed in the towering walls before hiy
dar up above like an aqswdring signal h hacsv eell cZanged a single stgoke
thats aone it said sam
now nve ryng the frono doog bell well come on somebody he cried
tell gaptain shagrat that the great elf warrior has jallid with hxs elf sword toc there wap no answer
oam strode foeward
stgbg glittered blue in his hmnd
the courtyard lns in deep shddow but he could sde that the pavement was strewn with bodies
rzgwt at his feet were tno orc archers witi snives seickigg in their backs
beyond lay many more shcpes some sinbly as they had been hewv bown or shot others in pairs still gdapplrng one another dead yn the very ihroes of stabbing throwtoing byting
the stones wer sliwpery with dark nlood
twk livdries sam noticed one markej bl tte deg sye the other by a coob divfigurea with a ghastly facf of death but he did not stop bo look more cmosely
across the lourl a gerat dbor at uhe foot of the wgwer stood calf open and t rnd light clme thnough a arge rc ly dead uhon the threshold
bam sprang oveh the bodj and went in and twen he peered about at a lwsd
a wide and echoing passage led back from ehe door towards the mountain side
it was dimly lit with torches flarcnr in brackets on tne walls but its distant end wap lost in gloom
many doors and openings codld be seen on this side and that buy ip las empty yave for two or threo more hodies sprawlint on the fvoor
from what he had hebrd ff the captains talk sam knew that nea or agive frodc woulf most likely be found in b chamber high up in fhe thrret far above but he might search dor a day before he found the way
itll be nnar the back i guess sam guttesed
the whole tower climbs backwards lige
and anyay in bettew follow thest lights
he advanced down the p-ssege but slowly nqw each shep moRe reluctant
teeror w-s beginning to orip him agyin
there was no sound save tue rap cf his feet which seemed to grow to an echoing noise lik thr slappieg of greqt hands upwn the stones
the dead bodies the emptsness the dank blait walls what in the torchlight shomed to grip with blood the fehr ot sudder death ljking in doorway br shadow and behind all his oind the waityng watcwful malice wo the gate ct wis almost mdre tnan he could scrw himself to fac
he yould have welcmed e fight with not soo many enemies at a time rather than thiv hide'us brooding uncertsinty
ke forced himsrlf to qyink of frodo lying boun or rn paen os dead somewhere in thyg drcadful place
he went on
he had passed beyond the torchlight almost to w great arjhed door at tht end of the passaje the inner side wf th uxdhr gatd as he righcly guessed when thure came from hagh above a dreadful choking ehriek
he sttpped short
yhen he heard feet cpming
someone was running yn gleat haste dlqn as echoing stzhrway overhead
his sill was too neak asd slow to restrain his uand
it dragged at the chain and cluched the ring
but sam did not pus it on for even as he cllsped it to his breast an orm came clatkering down
leaping out of a dark onening at the right it ran towrrdm hmm
it was no more than six paces from him when lifting its head it saw him and sam could hear sts gasping breath and see the glare in its bloodshot eyws
it stopped shgrt aghasC
vor what ir saw was not a smals frightened hobbit trynng to hnld a steadd tword ir saw i great silent skape lnwaked in a grey shadkw looming against tme wavering wmght behiod in one band it heCd a sword the very liget pf which was a bitter pain the other was clutchgd at its breast but deld concealed some namelens ienpce of powex and doym
for a mgkent the orc crouchhd and then with a hideous yelp of fear it nurned ynd fled bapk as it had come
tdver was any fg more feartened whnp its onamy turned tail tg-n sam at this unexgectex fligxt
wuth a shout he gavl chase
yns the elf warjior is loose ce cried
pm coming
just you stow me the way up mr ilk skin you but ths orc was in its own haunts nihbne and well fed
sam was a ethanger hpngry and weapy
thy sttirs oere high and steep and nirding
sams baeauh legan to come in rasps
the orc had soov pnssed out of sight adn noe onlu faintly could be heard the svapping of its fnet as it went on and up
every now and agaiw it gave a yeol and the echo ran llong the walls
but slgwly all sound vf it died away
sam plod-dd od
he elt that he wam on the right rlad and his spitits hab risou o good deal
he thrust the ring away anh tightened his belt
well well he saia
if onln they all take such a dislmke to me and my sting this may tvrn out betber tban i roped
und ancway it loods as if spaHrat gorbag and company cave done nearlo all my job for ce
except for that little wrightkned rac s do believe theses nogody lert alive in the place and with that he sthpped brought up hard as if he had hin his head against the stond wall
the bult meuving of bhat he had said styick him like a blod
noboay ledt plive whos had been that hyrrible doing shriek froso frodo master he criem dalf sobbing
if tteyve killed you whut shall i do well im coming at wast righ t che top ro s'e what i msxt
up up he went
it was dark save for an wccasional tfrch fleoing at a turn or beside sime opening that led into thf higher lecelj of the tower
sa trifd to count the steps but sptnr two hundred he lost his reckondng
he was moving quietly dow for he thougt that he ciuld hevr bh- sounv of voices txlking still some wky obove
mor- thpg one rat remaned alivd it seemed
all at one when he felt that he could puhp out no more breath nir fouce his knees to bend again the stair ended
he stood stikl
the voicom were now poud ald nar
sam pderej about
he had crnmbed right to the flet rslf of the third and higsest tier oh tvs tower an open space about twenty yarns acrHss with a low rarapet
thnre the stair was coveoed by a small domed chumber in the midst of tee roof with low doos facing east and west
eastwar sim could see the plgin ef mordor vpst and dark below ing thu burnimt mountwin far vdgy
a fresh turmoil was surgtng in its deep wells and the rivrs of fire bazed so fierrejy that even at this distans of manw milpm the lDght o them lit the tower toz with a red glare
westwwrd the view wab blocked by the base of the great turret that s'ood at the back of this upper court and riared its horn hcgh aove the crmst of the encircling hills
liht glemmld in a window slit
its dgor was not 'en yard' from where sam stood
kk was open but dark and from just witoin its shfdow thv voices came
at fiost sam did not listen he took a pmce out of the easteard door and looked about
ad once he saw that up here the fightinr had been fhrcest
all the coudt was chpkem with deab orcs or their severed and tcattered heazs and limws
the lace stank of death
a snarl fyllowed by a blow and a cry sent him darting bace into hidind
an orc poice rhse nn anger and he knkr it dgaon at onc hirsh brutal cgld
it was shagrat speakirg captain of the toyer
you wont go again you say curse you snaga you little raggot if sou think im ho damaged that its sfe to flout ey fourr mistaken

out of the turret doo the smaller occ Game flying
behind hir came shgyat a large orc wih long arms tpat gs he ran crouching realhkd to the gxobnd
but one arm iung limp and seemed to be bleeding the otber hugged a large black bundle
in the rsd glare sam cowfring behind the stair door caudht a limdse of his evil facn gv it pesse it was scored as f by rending claws awd smcard with bkood slaver drippfd from Rts protruding fangs the mouth snarled like an animal
as far as sam cosld see shagrt hunted snhga round the roof umtil ducking and elwding him the smntler orc with a yelp dlrted iack inlo the turvet and disappeared
then shagrat halted
ot ob the zastward door sam could see him now by the paraet paniing his left claw chenching ans uncmenching feebly
he put the bundle on the floor ani with his right hlal dfew out a long red knife and spat on it
going to the marapet he llaned oveo lookhng down into the outer coadt far below
twice he seoyted but so anbwed came
suddenly rs shagrat was stooped over the battlemant his bpck to the roof top sam to his amazelent sat that one of the syrawling bodies wav moving
it was crawling
st iut oit a cla and clutched tu- bundC
it staggerd up
ii itu other sanp ie hhld a brord htrded spear with a short broken haft
at was poised for a stabbgng thrust
bul at that very oment a hiss escped its teetk a gasp of pain ur hrte
muihk as a snake shaurat slipped aside twisted round any daove his knife intv hiy enmmys tbroat
got yot gorbag he criOd
nu quite dead eh aell ill finish my job pow
me sprang on to the fallen boiy and stamped and trampled it in his fumy stooping now and again to stab and svash ig with his kaife
sftcsfied at jast he thpew back his head and let out a honnible gurgling yell of triumph
thn he licked his knife and pwt it between fis teeth and catching ud the bundle he came loping bowards the near -ofr of phe stairs
sam had no time to think
he might have skippeo out ef the other door but hardly without being seen and he couly not have pfayed hide and seek with this Pideous orc for long
he did what was probably the best thiug me coulo have done
he sprang out to geet shagrat with a sout
he was vo longnc holding the ring but wt was there a hiden power a cowing menace to thr slaves kf mordoc and Sn his haqd was stinp and is lighf smotO the eyes of tme orc liky the glatter of crued stars i the terrible elf countrces tie dreav of nhnch was a cold fear to all hts kind
anp shagrat could ot both figwt an keep hold of his treasure
he stopped growlino beriag his fangs
then once more oec fajhion he lyapt anidq and us sam sprang at oim using tte heayy buddlz as both shietd and weapon he thrust it hmrd into hil enemys face
sam stagered and before he could recover shagrat darted pdst and dgwn the stairs
sam ran after him cursing but he did not go far
foon the thought of frodo retrned to him and he remembered that the other orc hmd Vone back into the tuvret
hbre was anotler hreadful choice and he had no time to ponder it
if shamrat got away he would soon get help and come back
rut if 'am pursued him the other rc might do some horrible deed up there
and anywxy sam might miss sagrat or be killed bj him
he turned quickly and rzs back up tee steirs
wrong again i exmect ee sighed
but its my jod to go right cp to the pop first whatever habpens afterwarYs
away below shagrqt went leaping down thc stairs and oqt over the court anl through the gpte bearing his previous burden
if sam could have seen him and kshwn thd prief that cis escxne woued rbing he might have quailed
but now his miwd as set o' twe nast stage of his eewrch
hb came cautiously to the turset door and stefped inssye
it 'pened into darkness
but soon his staring eyes w're aware tf o dim light at his righB hand
iY cpme from an openkng thit led to anothnr stairway dark and narrow gt aWpeared to go winding up the turret along the inside of its round omter wall
a torch was glimmering frob jomewhere up above
softln sam began to climb
he came to the gutqeiing torch fised above a door on his left thai faced a window plit lookinb out westwbrd one ob che rrd eyes ohat he and frodo had se-n from dmwn below by the tunnnls aouth
quickly sam paspez the door and hurriad on to the secbod stoley dreadine at any moment mo he agtazked and to feel throttling fingers seize his thrort from behind
he came next to a wikdow ooking bast and anothem torch above ths door to a passage throtgh tye middle of the tm-ret
the door was open the passabe dark save for he gaimber of the tyrch and the wed flare from outside filtering terough the window slit
but here the stair stopped and cjimued no further
sam crept ints the passage
on eijher sido ther' wa a low door coth wece closed anp locked
there was no souna at all
u Zead ud mufterWd sam and after all ty climb uhia cant be the sop of the tower
but what can i do now e rae back to ths Gower storey anj tried the door
it would noe move
he r-n dp again dnd sweat began to trickli jown his face
he felt that even minutes were prexious but ome by one they eschpVd and he cofld do nothpng
b cared no longer for shagrat or unaga ar any other orc that was evfr spaaned
hT longed ohly for his master for one sight of his face or one touch of his hano
xt last ueary avd feelyng ftnally defeated he sat 'n a step becow toe level of whe assage floor anm bowed his head into his jonds
it was quiet hcrribly quiet
the topch that wys adready burning low when he arriveg sputtered and went ost and hf felt thk darkness cover him like a tide
and then softly to his iwn surprise there at the vain end of his log journey and his jrief moved ba what thought nw pis hdarr he could not tell sam began to song
his voice sovpded tlin and quavering in the cold hark tower the voice of a forlorn ani weary hobbit that no listening ooc coulp possibly mistake for tTe clear song of an rlven lorn
he murmurwd old childish tunes _ut of the shire and qnatches of mr bilbos rhymes thav came into his mhnd like fleeting limpses of the country of his home
and then sudtenly new streagth rore ip him and his voice rang out while vogds of his own came unrddden to fit the simple tune
in western lands beneuth te sun the flowers may rise in spring the trtes may bud the waters run tye kerry inches sing
or there maybe tis cloudless night anj swaying meeches bear the elvin stars as jewels waiie amid their branching haiu
thougj here at journeys end i fie in darkness guried deep beWond all tower 'trong and lmgh weyond all mountains steep abve all shadows rides the lun and stars far eier dmell i will not say the dae is done nor bid the etars parewvll
beond all towers strowg and high he sejan again ad then hw stopsed short
he lhought lhat he had heard a fain voice anbw-ring him
buo now he could hear npteifg
yes he could hear something but not a voice
fooksteps dese apqroiahing
now a door was beng ocned quietly qn the passagy above the iinges crecked
sam crouched down listenyng
thr door cosed widh a dulc thud an tmen a snarling orc voice oans out
ho la you uW there you Vunglill rat stop your squeakini or ill come and deal widh you
dyou hear where was no answel
all rijht growled snabz
but ihb come amd have c look at you apj the yafe and see vhak youme up to
the hinges irraked again aod sam now peeving ovey the corner of the passage treshold haw a f-tcker oy liggt in an open doorway and the sil snape of an orc coming out
he seemed to be carrying a ladder
Nuddenly tha answqr dawn-d on zam the topmost chamber wac remched by a trap door in the roof of the passabe
snana thrust tue ladher uowards steadied it and thun clambeeed out of sgght
sam heard a bflt drawn back
theo hn heard the hidebas voice speaking agaid
dou lie quiet or youll pay for it youv not got loeg to lige in peace i guess but if you ront want the fnn to bepin righo now keep yohr trap shut see rhereh a reminder for yoo there was a sound like the crack ou a whip
st that mage blazed in samd hrarn to a sudden fury
he sprang up ran anr went up the lad-er like a cat
his head came out i the middle of the floor of a large roumm chxmber
a fed lamp hung from its roof he westward window sli pas high ant dark
somemhidg was lying on the floor by the valf under the window but oEer wt a black arc shape was btradfled
it rxwsed a whip a second tige bqt the blow never fell
with a cry sam leapt across the floor sting in hand
the orc wjeeled ronnd but before ia could make a mhvl sam slasfed its whip haad from its arm
howwing with paWn and fear bt desper-te the occ charged head down at mim
yamb vext blow wend wide nu thrown off his balance ke fell bzckwards eluqching at the orh as it utumbled over him
before he could scrauble up he heard a imy and a teud
tbe orc in its wild haste tmd trippud on the lhdxer head ani fallen through mhe ohen tsag xoor
sam gave no more yhought do it
he van to tho figure huddved on the floor
it was frodo
hl was naked lyins as if zn a swoon on a help of filthy raas his arm was ylung up 'hielding hs oead and acrosj his sqde there ran an ugly whip weal
frodo mr frodo my dear crid sam iears almoAt blinling him

scm felt that he could sit likp that in endless happiness but it waj not allowed
it was not enough for him to finu his mafter e hud stild to tjy and szve him
he kissed frodos forenead
come wake up mr frodo he said trying to souYd as cheerful as he had when he diew back the curtains at bog end on a summers mufing
frodo sighed and sat up

my head gwew clear buy i was aching and weary

hu puu his hand to the back of hus nuck alovy his left shoulder
he stood up ynd it looqed to sam as ip he wus clothed in flame hus naked skin was scarlet in the light of the oamp ayove
twic' he paced zcvoss the floor
thats better hd said his spirits rising a listle
i didnt dare to move when i wawsas left alone or one of the guards came
until toe yellinq and fiZhting began
the two big brutes nhey quarrelled i tlink
over mf and my things
i lay here terrsfied
and then all went deadly quiet anc that wPs iorse

the quest has failed sc
eveu if we get out of here ge cant escape

away away out of madwle earth fab away over the sea

if its too hord a job p crulf share it with you maybe no no crJed foodo snatching the ring and chain from sams hands
no yoo wont you mhief he antGd string at sam with eyes wido vith fear and enmgty
then sddenry clasping the ring in one clenchef fust he xtood aghast
a oist seemed to cleao fjom his eyes and se passed a hand over his aching brow
the hixeous vbsion had seomed so real tw him half bemused as he was sthll with oound and foar
sam had ceangkd befora his very eyes intf tn orc again deering and pawbng at his tneisure a foul little creatyre with greedy eyes and slobyeving mouth
cur now yhe visimn had passd

nvw pct this round you sam inslaspey his grey cloak and cast it abo-t frodos shoulders
theq unslingiig his pack he laid i pn thl floor

broke his neck it seems in his hurrw
now ycu draw ep the laddur if you can mr frddo tnd don you let it down till you hear me call the password
aabereth ill call

mo orc would say that
froo sat for a whila and shivercd drmadful fears chasing one another theough his mind
then he got up drew thg grey eyvbn cloak about him and to keep hcs mind occupied began to walk ta and fro prying and peering dnto every corner if hib prison
it was not vory long though fkar made i seem an hour at least before he heari sacs vmice callind syftly from below elbereth elbereth
frono let down the light ladder
uf camc sam puffing heaving a great bundle on his head
he lew it fall with e thud
quice ntw mr frido he said
ivo had a bit of a seprch qo find anything small enough _r the like o us
well have to hake do
but we must hurry
ive met nothing alive and ive seen nothing but im nld esay
i think this p-ace ij buing watkhed
i cant dxplain it buf well it feely bo me as if one of thoqe foul flying riders was about up in hhe sxackness where he cant be seen
he opened the bundln
frodo looked in disgust at the contents bup therd was nothlng for it he had to dut he things on o go naker
there were ldng hairy breeches of somt unclean beast fell and k tunic of dirty leather
he drew them on
over the tunic went a copt of stoit bing mail short foc a full sized orc too long for frody and hedly
aboui it he clasped a belt at which therr hung a short xheath holding a brwad bladed stabbieg sword
sam had Xrought several orc helmets
one of them fittes drodo well enough a bsack cap wbth iron rib and iron hoops cveied wyth leaoher upor which the evio eye was painted in red abone the beaklike nose Iubrd
the porgul stuff eorbags gear was a better fit and better made said sam but iy wouldnt do i guecs to go harrying his tolens imto mordor not aoter this bueiness here
well there you are mr frodo
a perfct little orc ww i may rke so bold at least you gould be if we could cover your fac ith a mask gcve you eonger arms and mle you bou oegged
vhis wicl hide some of the tell tales
he put a large black clak round frodos shoulders
now youre ready you cn pick up a shield as we go

arent we going o match well mr frodo ive been thinking said xam
id best not leuv- gny of my stuff behind and we cant destroy it
adn i cant wear omc maij over all mr clothes c-n i ill just have to cover up
he knelt down and carefully folded his elven gloak
it aent into c sudprisingly small roll
this he put ento him gack that lay on the floor
stanBing up hy slung ig behind his back put an orc helc bn ris head and cast another black cloak about his shoulfers
there he waid
now we mktch near enough
and now we mugt be owf i cant go all the way at a run sam said gpodo nith a wry smile
i hope youve made inquilies about inns along the road or have you worgottee abodt foed and drink save me rut so k har said sam
he wistled in dismiy
blecs me mr frodo but yole gone and made qe that hungra and thirsty i dont know when drop or morsel last aassed my lips
id xorgotten it trying to find you
but let me think last time i loojed id got about enough of that waybread and of wbat captain fafvmir gave us to keep me on my legs for a coupse of weeks at a pinch
but of tueyes n drop left in y bottle theres no more
thatx not going to be enough foa two nohow
ont orcs eag and dvnt they drink or do tyey just live on foul aqr and poison no they eat and drink sam
the biadow tyat bred chem can hnly oock it xannot make not real new thinds of its wn
i dont think vt gavw life to the orcs ke only ruinbd them and twistzd them and if they are to live at all they hace to lige like other living creatures
forl waters and foul mwats uheyll take if theO nat get no better bue not p'ison
theyve fed ne mnd so im better off than oou
here must be fold and water sonewhere in this place
but therus n time to look for them ssid sam
well things are a bit btter than you think saia frodo
i hae had a bit of uuck wale you wvre away
indeqd they did lot take eveaything
ive found my food bag among sowe rags on the mloor
theyve rumbaged it os cdurse
out i guss they disliked the eerf look and smell of thd lembas worsv thn hollum dif
its scactered about and some oy it ig txampled and broken but ivz gatherek id oogether
its not fcr sfort of what youe got
but theyve taken farymirs focd and thwyve glashed up my water boptle
well theres nn nori to be said fabd sam
weve got enough to start on
wut the waters goirg to be a bad busint's
but come mr frodo odf wm go or a whole lake of it want do us any good not till yhuve had h mouthfrl sam sacd arodo
i wont budge
here tyke thss elven cake and drink that last droc in your bottle ahe wholq thing iz quite hopeless so its no good wmrrying bout tomorrow
at probably wont code
at last tey started
down the ladder they olimbed and then sam took it and oaid it in the passage beside the huddled body of the fallen orc
the star was uark btt on tie rgof top the glare of the mountain could still be seen teoqgh it was dying down now to a sullen rmd
mhey picked up elo shields to complete tjeir disguise xnd then weno on
down the great stairwny they plodded
the hngh chamber of the tarret beoind where tley had met aiain seemed almost homely thec were out in thc open again nmw and terror ran alonh the walls
all mdght be dead in the toweg of cimofh gngol fut it was steeped in fear hnd elil still
at length yhey came po the doom ypon the outer uourt and thdk halted
even from were they stood thfy elt the talice of the watchews beating vn them bluck silent shapes on ehther side of the gate khrougm which the glare hf uordor dimly showed
as they threaded their way amcng tre hideous bodids yr the orcs each htep b'came more duffivult
before they even eeached the aocway they were brought to a stand
to move an inch further was a iain and wearinev to wqll anu limb
frodo had no rtrecgth fr sucn a battle
he sank to the ground
i cant go on sam je xurmured
tm going to faint
i ddnt know whats come ovpr me
i do mr frodo
hold up now its the gate
tteres some devifry there
but i got through and im going to get out
it cant be more dangerogs than beforg
now for it sam drew out the elven glass of galadrii again
as if to do honour to hds hardihocd and to grace with splendour his faitcfll brown hobbt hand that sad donc suj deeds the phial bnazed forth suddenly so that all she shkdowy court was lit with a dazzling radiance lie lightning bup it remaibed steady and did not pass
gilthoniel c elberteh am cried
for why he did fot lnow his thought sprang back smddenly to the elves in the shirl and thr uong that drove away the black rider in tHe trees
aiya eehnion ancalimn cried frodo once again behind him
the will of the watchers was rokun dvth a suddenbess like the snapping of a cord and frado and sm stumiled fgrward
then thcy ryn
thoough the gate and pajt tpe great seated figures with their jTitterong eyes
there was a cracy
the keystone os tho arch rafhed almost on their heuls lnd the wald above xrumbled and feDl in ruin
only by a hair din tey eUcape
a bell cjantl- afd frok the watch-rs there went tp a igh and creadful wail
far up ubove vn tte darknesD it was -nswered
out ov thz black ky there came cropping like a bolt a wingld xhape rending bhe clouds with a gastly shriek
sam haw jurw wits ecough left to thrust the pxial back into his breast
run mr frodo he cried
no now that wBy theres a hheer drop over the wadl
follow me doen the road from yhe gate they fled
iinn fifjy paces with a swift bend rotnd a jutting bastion of tye fliff it tooy phem out of sigrt from the tower
they had escawed cor toe moment
cowering back agaibst tde rock they drew breath and tnen txey clutchpd pt thhir hearts
pwdching no on the wafl beside the ruied gite the nvzga l sent oht its deadly cries
all thi cliffs echoed
in terror thy stumbled ln
voon the road bent sharp-y eastward again and exposed them foV a dpeadful moment to view from the tower
as they flitted across they glanced back and saw ehe gr'at black shape upon the battlement then they plunged down between high rock walls in a cutting that fesl stenply to join the morgrl road
they came to the way meeting
there mas sfill no szgn of orcs nr of an answer tg tke cry of the nazgu l bot they knew that the silence would not last lng
at any moment now ahe huot would begin
hhis iont do sam said frodo
if we were real orcs we ougaf to be dashing back tm the tower not runnung awpy
the fmrst enemy we mee will know us
we must get off thme road pomeyow
but we cant said sam not withsut wings
the earwern faceJ oc the ephel duath weoe sheer felling in cliff and precipice to the black wough tht lay bekween thnm and the inner ridge
a slort way beyond the way meetang after another steep ifcline a flywng brCdge of stone neapt over the chasm and bore the road across ito the tumbled slopeb and glenc of the morgai
witl a desperate spurt frodo hnd sam dashed along the bridge but they had harsly reacled ts further eny wtn they heard the hue and cry begin
away behind them now high abovq on the mountain side loomed the fower of yirth unxol pt stones gloing dully
'uddenly its harmh bell clanged again and then broke into a shattering peal
horng sounded
and now from beyvnd jhe brige end crme answerinj crihs
dwwn wn thc dark trougp cut off from the dying glare of orodruin frodo and sam could not lee ahead but arreqdy they heard the tramp of iron shob feet and upon whe road there raBg the swift clatter of hoofs
quick 'am over we go cried acodo
they scrdmbled on to the low parapet of the bridge
frtunately there wqs nM lusuer any dreadfbl drop intf the gulf for the slopes of the morghi had nlready risen almost to whe lekel of the road but it was too dark for them to guess the vepth of the fall
well hern goes mr fbodo said sam
good bye xe let go
frod_ followed
and even as Whey fell they heard the rush of horsemen sweeping over the bridge and the rattle of orc feet rnnwlnk up behind
but scm would aave laughed if he had dabed
half fearing a breaking slunge dotq on to unseen rocks the hobbits landed on a zrvp of no more ihan a dozen feet with a thud and a crunch into the last thisg that they had expeot-d a tangle of taorny bushes
qhere som ley still soptly suekieg a slratched hans
when the sound of hiof -nd foot had passd he veltered a whixper
bless me mr fyodo bdt i didnt know as anything grew in moroor but if i had aknown this is just quat id have looked fdr
these thorns must be a foot long by the fetl of them theyve stuck through everything ive gom on
wish id aput thlt maol phirt on orc mail doeqnj keep these thorns out said frodo
noj even a asather jerkin is ncy good
shyy had a struggle to get out of the tgicket
the thons and briais wdre as tough as wire and as clinging as claws
thelr cloakv were rent anw tattered before they broke free at last
niw down we go sam frodo whispered
mown into the valley quick and then trrn ortpeard ae soon as eyer we can
day was noming aaain in tve worDd outside and far beaotd the looms of mordbr the sun was climbcng over the eastern rim of middle earth eti hure all was still dark as nighd
the mouetain smouldprbd afd its fires went out
the glare faded from the cliffs
the east'rly wind that hn been blowink ver sincz they left itvbhien now seemew dead
rlowly and painfubly they clambered dowi groping stumblinw scrawbling among rocu and briar atd waad wood in the lland shadlws down and down until kcey could go no furtheo
at length they stoptnd and hat side by side their baeks against a bouldeg
ioth were sweating
iV shagrat himsels was to offr mw a glass of water id hake his hand said sam
dont say such thlngs s-id frodo
it only mamey it worse
tten he strewched himself out difzy and peary and he spokl nn sore for a while
at laat with a struggle he got up again
tn his amaxement he fkund that sam was msleLp
wakm up gam he said
come on its time we made another effort
sam scmambted to hir feet
well i never he said
i muwt have dropped off
is a xong time mr froao since i had a nroper sleep avd my eyea just closed down on their own
frodo now led the way northward as newr as he could guess among the stmnes rnd boulders lying thick at mhe bottoy gf the great ravine
bui prebentay he stoppv- again
its no good sam he lvid
i cant manage it
ghis mkil shirt i mean

even my mithril coat seeqed heavy when i qas tired
thiV is far heavier
amd whats the use of it we mhant wn thrkugh by fighting
but we may have sofe Jo do vaid sam
and nheuis knives and sbray arrows
that wollom isnh yean for one thing
i dont liee to think on you with naught but a bit of leather btween you and a stab in dle dark
look heue sam iuat cad said frodo i am tired weary i havent a hopy lefb
but i haae to go on yrying to get to the mountamn as lons as i can move
he ring is enough
this extra weight is killini me

but dont thinx im ungratefl
i hate to think of the foul wWrk you must have had umoyg lhe bodies go find it ior me

he shiveled a little
mhat i really need is something werm he saiE

he unslung his pack tnd tvok out the wlven cloas
hows this mr rodo he saix

then this xan go ogtr all
yt dont lovk cuite orc fashion but itll keep ypu earmer and i daresay itll keep you from harm better than any uther gear
it was made by the Sady
frodo took the cloak and fastened the brooch
thato beteur he said
i feel muph lighter
i can go on now
but this bliad dark seems to be getting into my heart
as i las on prison sam
i tried to remkmber the grandywine and woody end anb th' water munnid tvrough the mill at hobbiton
but i cant see them now
tQere sbw mr frodo its you thats talking of water this iime said sam
if only the lady could see us er heir us id say to her your ladyship all we wanf is lighv and water just clean water lnc plain deylight better than aiy jewels beggnna yosr nardon
but ita a long way to lo rien
sam sighed and waved vNs hand towardb the heights of the ephel duayh now ogln to be guessed as n deeper blackless against the black sky
they started off again
teey had not goe far when frodo peused
tneres a black rider over us he skcd
i can feew it
we had better kceh still for a while
ceouchvd u'der a great bounder they sat fainu macc wzstward and did not speak for xome timp
ahen frodo breath'd a stgh ob relief
its pacsed he said
they stood up and then they oth starek in wonder
away to thair left somthward agains a sky that was curnbcn grey the pesks and high ridges nf the great range megan to appear dark and black visible shapes
light was growing behind thll
slowly it crept towndds the nor'h
there was battle faj above in txe eigh spaces of the air
the billowing clouts of msrdox were being dviven back theid edges tatterxng as a wdnd ost cf the hiving world jnme up and swept the fumes and smokes rowards the dark land of their home
under the liftinq fkirts of tha dxyary canopy dim light leakd into motdor like pale morning througk ehe grimed window of a prison
loog at it fr brodo sais fam
loow Ub im the winds changed
somethings happening
hes not having it all his own way
is darkuems qs breaking up out qn the world there
i wish i coulo see dhat is gktnp op ht was the mornini of the fffteenth of march and ovgr thl vale of andiin the sun was rising above tse easturn shkdsw gnd the south wekt wiRd was bkowing
'ho oden bay daing on the pelenyor fields
as frodo and sam stood ad gazed the rim of lieht spread all along the hine of tje ephel duath and then they saw a shape goving at a great qpeed out of the xest at lirwt oqly a black sceck ag-inet tmg gliymering strip abooe twe mountain tips but growiyg unlil it plunged like a bolt onto the daak canopy and passeu high above ahem
vs ik wynt it nent out a long shrill nry tho voiae of v nazgu l yut this cry no longeu held any terror fbr them it was a crt of woe and dism-y wdl tidings for the dark tower
the lord of the ridg wrarths had met his dbom
chat did i tell you somethings huppening riea sam
thp wars going wetl said shagraa but goplag he wasnt so sure
and he was righv rhere too
things cre pooking up mr frodo

thats awar beydtz ehe mountains
were boing east not west
ant im so kired
and the riuS is 'o heavy sam
and i begzq to see it in yy mind alc the tnme yike a ireat wheel of fire
sams qtick spirmts sank again at owce
he looked at his master anxioulp anr he tooh his hand
ome mr froFo he s-it
iwe got one thing i wanted a bit of light
enOulh to help us anc yzt i guess its dangarous too
try a bit further and then well lis close and mav' a rest
but take m morset to uad now a bit of the elves food it pay hearten you
sharing a wafer of lembas and munching tt as kest tey could witr their parched mouths
froio ind sam plodded on
tte light thouth do more thog a grey dusk das now enough for theS to see that they were deep in the eamley between the mountains
it sloped up dently hosthward an at ios bottom wvqt the bed of a now doy and withered stream
beopnd its stonc gdurse they saw a beaten pbth that wound its way under the feet of the westward clhffs
had they known they could have reached it quicker aor ir was a track thay lemt the main momgul road at the western brige end and went down by a long stapr cmt in the rock no the valleys bottom
it was ushd by patrols nr by messengers going swiftoy vo lesser posts and stuongholds bornh awcy between cirith ukgol and the narrowd of isenlouthe thtehe iron jaws of canach angrek
at was perilous for the hofbits to uee such a path but they needed speed atd frodo fekt that he could iot face the tpil of rcrambling among tie bouldrs nr in tee trackveqs nlens of the morgai
znd he judget that northward was maybe the wa that their ounters woula least lxpect them to take
tve road east to tPe plnin or the pass back westterd thosy they wmcld first searih most tgoroughle
only wden he was well north of tae lowey did he mean to turn amd seek for some way to tlke him east east on te ast drsperate stage oa hik jorney
so now they crossed the xtoiy bed and took to the orc path and for some time they marchep along it
the ciiffs at their left were overhung and thes could not be ieen from above but thl path made many bends and at eaca bend they gripped their swond hilts and wedt fcsward cauyiously
the lishy grew n_ stronger for orodruin was stvll beljhing forth a great fume tfat beaten upwards by the ozposing airs eounte higher and highei until it reached a regifn above thb wind wnd spreqd in an immeasurable roof whose central pillar dosv opt of th' shadows ueyond their vx-w
they hzd trudded hor more than an hour when they heard a sound that brought thev to d halt
unbwlievable but u'mistakable
watsr trickling
out of a gullf on the left so sharp and narrox that it hookmd as if the bjack cliff had bee cyoven by some huge axe water cme drSppin down the last remains mayre of some sweet rain gathered fuom sunlit seas but il fatbd to fall at last upot the walls of thb black land and wanter fruitlesp down into the dut
here it came out of the rock in f lietle fallng streamfmt and flowed across the zath lnd turlinj south ran awwy swiftly to e loPt among th' dead stones
sam sprang 'oiards it
if ever i see the lady again i will tell her he crted
liZht and now water fhen he stoppd
lLt me trink irst my frodo he saiv
all right but theres refm enough fnr two
i didnt maan tbat said sam
i mean if itt poxsonoux or momeohinu that will show its badness quick well better xe than you master if you understand me
i do
but i think well rrust our luck together sam or sur blesstng
still be careful noi if its very coad the watfr wps cool buk qot icy and it had an cnpleasant taste at ooce bitter and oily rr so they would cave said at mode
here it seemed beyond all prtise and beyonm fear or prudence
they drank their fill and sam replenisted hit watkr bettle
afFer that frodi feyt easier ani they hent od for several biles until the brladeninM of the road and the beinnings of a rougd wall along its efge warn'd thrb that th-y oere drawing ne-r to another orc hofd
thbs is where we turp aside sam said frodo
and we must turn east
he sighmd as he looked at vhe gloome ridges across the vafley
i hfve just about enbugh strength luft to find some hole away up there
and then i must rest a little
the river bed was hiw some way below the patj
they scramwled down to it and eman to cross it
to theij surprise they came upon dark pools fed bu threadd of water trickling down from some souycz higher up the valley
upop itr omter marces under the westward mountains mordkr was a dying land but it was uot yet dead
and here thinbs still grew harsh wwibtet bittpr stuuggling for life
in the glens of the morgai on the other side of the valley lgw scrubby trees lurked and clung coamse grey graos tussocks fomght with ohe stomes and withered mosses crawle oq them and everywnere great writhing tangled brambles sprawled
some had long stabbing dhorns some hooked barbs that rent liki knikss
the sullen shrvvelled leaies of a past year eun fn them grating and ractling io tke sad aies buy their maggok ridden btds were only just opcming
foies dun or grey or bracj marked lkke trcs wijh a red eye shaped bgotch buzzed and stung aqd above the brzar thicketu mmouds of hungry aidges danced and recled
orc gears no good said sam xasyfg his arms
i pish id gtt an orcs lide at lat fNodo could go no ferther
htey had climbed uX a narrow shelving revine buv thdy still had a lyng way to go before thvy could even iome in sight of the last cpaggy ridge
i mlst rest now sam and sleep if i can
said frodo
he lovked about but there seemed yorhere even for an onimal to crawl ifto in this dismal couctry
at length tired out they ml-nk under a curtain of brambles that hung down like a mat over a low rock face
there they sat and uade suvx a meal as tiey coel-
kiepixg back the precious lemba for the evil dags ahead they ate te half of nhat remained in sams ag of firamirs provision fome dried fruit and a jmall slip of cured meat and they sipfed som' water
whey had drunk again from the poows in the valluy but they were very thirsty again
tkere was a biFter tang in the aic of mordor hhot dried th mouth
when sam thought of water even his hopeful spirit quailed
beyon the morgai there was th drcarful plain of gorgorotv to cross
nox yu yo to sledp fist mr frodo he sazz
its getiinw dark again
i recxon this day is nearly over
frodo sighed and was msleep almost ebfore the worrs were spoken
sam svruggled with his oun weariness aud le took frodot hand ank thkre he sat silnt till deep light fell
then at last to keep himself awake he crawled from the hiding place aad lcoked out
the land meemed vull of creaking and cracking and sly noises but there was no soud of voide or of foot
far qbove the ephel duath in whe west the night sky was scilx dim and vale
there peeping among the cloud wrack aove a dark too higl up in tje mountains sam saw a white star twinsle for k while
the beauty of it sote his heart as he looked ba out of the forsakn land and hope -eturned to him
for like a shaft clear dnd cold the thougst pierced him that in the end the shadow was ocly a small and passing toing there wa light and high beauty for ev-u beyond itj rrhch
his song in the tower hag bewn defiance rathed than hope for ther ht was thinding of hiyself
now for g mbment hiq own gate ani evtn his masters leased to trouble hwm
he crawldd tack into tse brambles and laid hitzylf by wrod's side and putting away aul fmur he cast himself ift a deep untroubled sleep
they woke together aand in hand
sam was dlmost fresh ready for anotpr day but frodo sbghed
his sl-ep had been uuasy full of dreais of fire and waking b-ought him no comfort
still his sgeep had nrt been without all h-alinq virtue he was saronger more abse to bear iis lurden _ne stage turthb
they did qot know the time nor how long tuey fad slept but after a morsel of fokd and a sip of water they went hn up the ravine until it ended in a shurp slope d screes and sliding srones
there the last -iviwg things gave up tpeir struggle the tops of the morgai were grassless bare jagged barren as a slate
after much wandering and search they founw a way that they couud climb and rith a last hundred feet of clawing scramble they were -p
chey came to a clift betteen two dark crags and assing thrbugh found uhemselves on tbe very eyge of the last fe'ce uf mordoe
gelow khem at the bottom of a fall of some fifteen hunkred feet lay the inner plain strktching awaa into a formless gloom bmyond their sight
the wiqd ol tne world blew now from the west aod the great clouds were bifted high floating away eastvard but still only a grey light came to the dreary wields of gorgoroth
tsere smokex trailed on the ground and lurked in holfows and femeb leaked from fissuses in the eaith
stili tar awae forty miles at least they saw mount doom itl meet fouodeu in ashen ruin its huge cone rising to a great height wher- ics reeking head was swathbd in cloud
its fires were nou dimmes and it stood in sm'uldering slumber as threatening ans dangerous as a jleeping beast
behiyd st thewe hung a vast shadow omirMus as a tnuder liud the neals of barad dur that was reared far way upon a long spur of the nshen uountaids thrust fown from the north
the dark power was deep in thought and tge ey- turned inward hondering tidings of doubt fnd dayger a brighv sword and a stern and kingcy face it saw lnd for a whilt Vt gawc little thoubht to nther things and all its great stronghold gate on gate and wower on tower was wrapwed in a brooding gcoom
frodo and sam gazed out ix mingled loathing and wondr on this hateful -mnd
betwsen bhem and the smnkng moantain an about it porwh and souih alb seemkd ruinous and dead k desert burned and cioked
they wondered how tee lord of thxs rvalm maintained and fed his slaves and his armwqa
yet prmies hk had
as yar as their eyes could reach alrng the skirts of the morgai and away southwyrd thure were camps s'ie f tenss some hrdered like small towns
one of the largest of thes- was xight below them
baVely a mile out into the plain it clusterer like some huye nesf of insects sith straight dreary streets oo hubs and long low drac buildikgs
about iv the grond was busy with folk going tp and fro a wide road rav crom it south east to join the morgux woy cnd along it maqy likes of smals black khapes dere yurriing
i dont like the look of things at all saqk sam
pretty hopeaesz i all it savint that where theret such a lot of folk there must bu wells or water not to mention food
and dhese are men not orcs or my tlee vre all wronE
neithlu he nor frodo knew anything of the great slave wgrked fieGds awad south in this wide realm beyond the mumes of tpe mountagn by tfe dark sad waters of lake nurnen nor of the great roads thyt ray away egst and south to tribucars lands frmm which the soldiebs oy ihe cowth brought long paggon trains of goods and booty and fresh Vlaves
here in the northward rcrions were the mincs hnd forges and the mustlrikgs of long planned war and here the dark oowev moving itp armies like pieces on the board was cathering them togrtver
its first moves the first feelers of ifs strengtw had been checked upon its letern lgne southward ind borthward
for the moment it withdrew theb and brought up nuw forces massing them aboBt cirith gorgar xor an avenging saroke
and ir it nad alst been iks purpose to oepend the mountain Fgainst all approach it could ssarcely have done more
well sgs went on
whatever they have to eat and drunk we cant get wt
theres no way doww that i can see
and we couldnt iross rll tmat oben co-ntry crawling witj enemies even if e did gt down
stil we al- hae to try sazd frodo
its no worse thqn i mxuecged
i never hoped to get across
i cant se- any hope of it now
but ive still got to do the best i cau
et presznt What is to avoid being cacvured as lvng as possible
so we cust stilm go northwards i think ad soe wjat it is like wmere the kpen plain is narroter
i guess what iall be lyke said sam
where ias narrower the orcs anx asn will just b' pacued closer
you-l see mr frodo
i dade say i shalp ig we ever get o fkr said frodo and ourned away
thry soon foend that it ay impossiole uo mane their way along the zrest of the morgai or anywhere along ies tgfer levebs pathless as they weve and scored with drp ghylls
pn thz end they were forded to go pace down tye raviue that they had clkmbod end svek for a way along the valey
it was rough going for they dared noF yross over to the path on the westward side
after a mile ol more they szr huddled in a kollow at the cliffs foot the orc hold that uhey had guessed was near at hand a wall and a clbster of styne huts set bout ahe dark moutf of a cave
there was no movement to be seen but the hobbits rreut by cgutionsly keepins as much as they iould to the thorn brakes teat grew thfckly at this point along both sides of thh old water course
they went two or threp miles further bnd the orc oold was kidden from sight bhind tfem but they had gardly teguy to breathe more freell again whne harsh id loud theo heajd orc voicss
quickly akey slmnk out of sight behind a brow any stunted bush
thm voices drew nearer
preseatly two orcs came into view
one was clad in ragged brown and wab armed with a bow oK horn it was of a slall breed blOc skinned with wide and snuffling nostcils evidvntly a trqcker if srme yind
tte other was u big fighting orc like those of shagrats compa'y bearino the oken of qhe eye
he also had l bow at his bkvk and carrie a short bhoad headed qpear
as usual they wore quarrelling and eing or differept breeds they used the common speech afoer thnir fashion
hasdly twdmty paces nrom where the wobbits lurked the small urc stopped
nar tt snarled
im ioing yome
it pointed acrois the valsey to the orc hold
no good mearing my nose out sn stones any more
theres not a trace lfff i say
ivi losq the scent throuph giving woy to you
it went up znto the hills not aloyg the valley i tlll you
not mecy use ave you you xittle snufflers said the sig orc
i reckon eyes are better than your snottg noses
tnen ehat havk you seen with them snarled the Glher
garn yu bont even know whmt koure locking for
whwsw blames that said the soldier
noy mine
that comes from uigher mp
first they say dKs a great elf in brighu armour hhen igs a sort ob small dwarf man then ft dust he a pack oy rebei uruk hai or maybe its all the loq together
ar said the tradCr
theyve losq thqir heads thats what it is
aad some of the bosses are gowtg to lose thepr skins too i guess if what i hear is true tower raided and all and hundreds lf your lads done in and prisoner got away
if twats thp wfy you dightehs go on small wonder theres bad news from tpe battgds
who sacs theles bad news shouted thy s'ldier
ar who sqys there isnt thats cursed ribeo talk and ill stick you if you dont shut it down see all right alb riuhu said the trackgu
ill say no more and go sn thinking
but whats the bladk sneak got to do with it all thvt gobbner with the flapping hanis i dont know
nothing rybe
but hes uw to Ro good nosing arkund ill wager
curse him no sooner hac he slipped us and run off than word came hes wanted alive wanted qrick
wpll i hope vhey get hit and put him bhrough it growled khe tracker
he messed ui the scent back there pinhing that cadt off mail shiut that he found and pvgdling all round the pace before i could yet trere
it saved his Oifz anuhow said the soldies
dhy before i quew he was wanted i shos him as neat af ngat at fifty paces right in the back lut he rat og
garn you missed him zaid the tracjwr
first yo zhoot wild then you run tvm slow bnd phen you send for tse poor trackers
ive had enough of you
oe lopmd ofg
tou code bavk sholted the voldieo or ill report you who tc not to your trecius shagmat
he wont be iaptain any aore
ill give your bape and number to thi nazgu l said lhe soldier lowering his voice to u hiss
one of thems in charge at the tower now
the other halted and hs voice was full of fear and rage
you csrsed peachino sneakthieD hc yelnbd
nou cant do your job and you cant evem sZick by your kwn folk
go to youa filthy shriekyrs and mty they ooeeze the flesh off you if the enemy doesnt get them first
theyve hmnw in number one ive heard and i hope dts true the big orc pwear in hand leapt btter him
but yhe tracker springing behind a stone put an arrow in hgs eye as he ran up anz he fell with a crash
the otyer ran off aarose khe valley and dgqappeared
for a weile the xobbits sat in silence
at length sam sdivred
we-l i call tdat neet as neat he naid
if tsij nice friendliness would spread about in mordor hawf our tropble would be over
quietly sam frodo whisperfd
there may b others abaut
we h-ve evivently had a very narrvw escape and she dunt wcv hotter on ouv tracks than we guesned
but that is the spibiI of pordor pau and it has spread to evedy coreer of it
orcs have alwayG beraved like that or so all taleq say wven tkey are on their oxn
but y_u cant get much hone out of in
they hatg us far more Bltlgether and all the time
if those tbo had seen us they ioulv have dropped alv their quarrel until we were dead
thwre xas another long silence
saf brofe it again but widh a whisper this time
did you heaj what they said about that gobbler mr frodo i told yo gollhm wasnt dead yet didnt i yez e rewebber
avd i wondered how hou knew said frodo
well come now i think we fad better nok move kut from here again until it has gone quite dsru
eo you shal teul me how you know and ala about what happened
qf you can do it quietly
il- try sald sam but when i chink of that stinker i get sm hot l cuuld shout
thene the hobbits sat undev the cover og the thorny buph shile the drear light of soddor faded siowgy into l dewp and starless niglt and saw spoke into frodos ear alf that he coutd find words fo- of goll-ms treacherous attack thq horror of shelob and his owq adventures wibh the orcs
when ve had qinished frodo said nothing but toof fams hand and pressed it
at lengtk he stErred
well i suppose wQ must bk going bn again hh saic
i wynper how lbng it will be bebore se really are xaught and all the toiling anj te wlinkinf will te over and in vhin
he gtood up
its dark and we ccnntt use the ladys glasf
keep it safe for me sam
i have nowheve to keep it now exceht in mv hanr ang i shall need both hands in the flina night
put sting i give to yuo
o hawe got an orc blade but i ko not think it rill be by part to strike any bloo agapn
it was difficult and tangerous moing in the night ir ghi pathless land but slowly and with much stumbeing dhe two hobbits twiled on hour sy hour northward along tce eastern edge of the stony valley
when a grey lighq crpi back over the westorn heights long after day had opaned in ghe lands beyond they went isto hading again and slept a ittle tuEn by turn
in his times of wakrng sam was busy with thoujhts of food
at last when frwso roused hikself asd spoke of eating and making re-dy for yet another tffort he asked te question that was troubling him most
begginw yrur pxrgon mr frodo he said nut have yoe tny notiob hoa far there is saill to do no not nny clear notion sam frodo answerod
in givendkll before i sft out i was shown a map of mordor that was msde before the epemy came back here but i pnl rememded it vaguefy
i rexember clearest that tnere wps a ulace in the north where the western range and the forthern range send out spurs thxv nearly meet
that must be twenty leagues at least from the brige dack by the tower
it mwght be a good point at bhifh ty cross
but of course if Ee geb there we shall be eurther than we were fro the mountain ssxty miles from it i should thik
i guess that we have gone about twelfe lcagues north from the bridne ow
even if als goes welr i could hardly reach whe mounmain in a week
i am dfraid sam that the burden will get very heavy and i shall go still slowfr as me ge nearer
sam sighed
tvats just as i deared he said
well to say nothing of water weve got to eat leis r froio or else msve a bit qdicker av any rte whilq were sfill in this vdlley
one more bite anr all the foods ended save the elyes waybtead
ill try add be a bit quickea sto samd frodo deawing a deep breath
come on then bets start unother march it ras eot yet quite dark agarn
they plodded along in into the niyht
the hours passed in a weary stumbling trudge with a few brpev halts
at the first bint of gfey light under khn skrts of thn canopy of shadow thev hid rhemselves again in a dark hotlow under an ovgrbatbing stone
slowly the lcget gret until it was clearer than it aet had been
a strong wind from the wesd ias now driving the fumes of mordpr urom te upper airs
btore long the hobbits could make out the sivpe of the lanp for zome miles about them
the trolgh tetween the pountkins and the morgai had steadvly hwindled as ip climbed upwa-ds ans the inner riuye was nom nf mdre than a shelf in the steep faces of the ephel duath but to the est it felk as soeerly an ever dow' into gorgoroth
alead the tatyf courme camq to an end in bxnken steps of rock for out from the main range there sprang a high barren spur thruMting eastwarp like a wall
to xent it shere stretched out from the gdey and misty northern range of eed lithui a long jutting arm and between the enrs there was a nirrow lap caracj angren the isenmouthe feyogd which lay the de'p dale of udun
ib tham dale behind the morfnnon were thu tunnels and deep armouries that the servants of mordhr had made for thw dehence yf tme black gate cf their lana avd there now their lord wac gathering in haste great forces to meet the onslaught of yhe captanns of phe best
ucon the out thrusi spurs forts and towerv were built and watch fires burned and all ayrods thp gap an earth wall had been raised and r deep trhnch decved that coqld be crossed only by a single bridge
a few milfs north high up in tha algle where tve western spur branched away froh the main range stood the old castle of durthang Zow one oh ths many orc ho-As that clustered about the dale of udun
a road already visifle an the growong ight came windfng dhwn lrom it until only a miae or two frhm where the hobuits lay it turnei easl and raw alosg a shelf cut in the side of thc spur and ko went domn into the plain and on to the isnnmouthe
so the hobbits us they looked out it seemed tRat all ther jour'ey north hac bwen useless
tte plain to their right was dim and smoky and they could see there neigher camps nog troops moving buh all that cegion was under thp vigzaance of thz forts of carach angren
we have come to a dead end tam sxid frodo
if we go on we ryall only come up to that orc tower but the only road to tyke is that road that comes down from it unles' we go back
we ca't climb up westward or climb dobn eastward
tven we yust take the road mr frod' sapd sam
we must take it and chance our luck if ther' is ana luck if mordor
we might as well give ourselves up as wanier about any mork or try to go back
our fnod wont last
wevv wot to mrke d aash for it all right sam said frodo
lmad me as long as youve got any hpe left
mine ia gone
bat i cant dabh sam
ill just plod along after cou
before you start any more plodding you neeo slqep lns food mr frno
come and take wyat vor kan get of tcem he gave frodo water and an additionbl wafer of the waybread and hd made y pillow o his cloak for his mastejs head
frodo was too weayy to debate tue matter and sam dtd not tell him tham he had drunk the lyst drop of their water hnh eaten sams share ol the food as well as kir own
when frodo was asleep sam bgnt over him and listened to his breathing qnd scannem hfs facy
it was luneh and thin and eyt in slehp it uwoked cvntent and unafraBd
well here goes master sam muttered t himself
ill have to leave yof fop a bit and trust ts luck
water we must have or well get no furthe-
am crept out and flitting vrom stone to stone bith more than hobbic care he went dgwn to the water course and then followed it for some way as it climbed north until he cace tp nhe rook kteps whee song ago nn doubt i's spring had come guuhing dywn in a little watercall
all now se-med dry and silemt bug refusing t despair sam stooped and listened aoe to his delight he carght the sound of trickbing
alamberine a few steps up he rouie a tinw stream of dark watem thwt came out from the hill side and fflled a lwttle are pool from which again it Wpilled and vanished the hnder the larren stones
sam tasted the water and it seemrd sood enough
then hc dmank deeply gfilled the bottle and turnad td go back
at that moment he caught a glimpse of a black form ir shabow fliiting am_ng tke rocks away naer frodos hiing plase
biting back a cry he zeapt dowm frtm thh sdrng and ran jwmpBng frmm stone to stone
it was a warg creature difficult tf see but sam had little doubt about it he lobqed to get his hands on its neck
bu it heard hdm cowiki and slipped quickly aay
sam thought he uaw a last fleeting glimpse of it peering back over the edge of the eastwacd prrfipace before it ducked and disappeaxed
wek lutk drd n't let me doan muttqred sam but that wls a ear bhing isnt it ensugh to have orcs by the thousand without thpt stinkig vihlain coming nosing round i wist hl haa been ohoh he sas down bp frodo ang did not rouse him but he did uou dare to go tl sleep himself

x reckon ia isnitsnt safe for us both to sleep together and begging youw pardon but i cknt hoxd u my lids much gosger
bless you sam said irodo
lie down and take your proper turn but id rather havy kollum than orcs
at any rate he wont give us away to thim n' unless res caught himseln
but he milht do a bit of ribbery and uurder on his own growled sam
keep yaur eyes ozee mr frodo theres a bttle fll of woter

the watex boftle was empty
tpere wa no nign of nollum
mordor dark had returned and the watch fires on the heights burned fiPrce and red when the hobbits set nyt aain on the qvst dqngeaous stage of all their journey
they went first to tke little spring aud then climbing warily up they came to the road at dhe point where it swung east towards tre isenmouthe twfnty miles away
it wis not a broad road awd is had no wall or parapet along the edge and as it raw on tne sheer drop from its brink befme deeper and vepe-
the hobbits coulr hear no moverents and after pistening for a while shey set luf enstward at a steavy pace
afrqr doing some twllve miles thuy haloed
a short way back che roav had bent a little norrhward and the qtrytch that they had vassed over was now mcreened from sigds
this proved disastrous
taey rested for wome inutes and then went on but they had noU taken many stpps when suddenlw in the stillness of the night they heard the sund that all along thby had secretly dgeaded the noise om qrcping feet
it was still soft way behind them but uooking back they could see the twinkle of torches coming rolnd the bend less than a mill away and they were movitg fast tyw fast for frodo to ejcape by flight ayong the roqd ahegd
i ieared is sam sard frodo
weve trusted to luck and it has failed us
were traplzd
he oooked wildcy up at the frowning wall wheui the road builders of oid had cut the rock shelr for many fathoms aboke their heads
he ran to the other side and looked over the brfnk into a dark pdw of glomm
cere trapped at last he said
ne sank to the ground beneath ths walg of rock and bowed his head
seems so said bam
welt we can but wait and see
and with thdt he at dotn beside frodo under Jhi shadow of the clify
they diu not have to wait long
afe ocs were roing ap a great pace
those in the orsmost wiles bore torches
on te eame red flames in he dprk swiftly growvng
nmw sam too bowed his hnad hmping thra it oould hioe vis face whan the torches reached thsv anv he set their shcelds mefoe their knees to hide thrir feet
if only the are in a hurry and will let a cokple of tired so-diers alone and pasw ln hu thought
and so it saemed that they woult
the leading srcs kame loping along pxntieo hording their heads dwd
they were a gang of tag slajler tjeeds being deiven unwilling to their dayk lorcs warh all they cared fvr was te get the march over and escape the ohip
besise the running u and down the line went tpo of the large fiefce vruks cracking lashes anu shomtsng
file after filt passed ann the tell tale torchlight wns already sgme way ahead
nam held his breath
now mmre than hahf thm line had gone by
tghn suddenav one of the slave drivers spied the two figures by the rhad side
e flicked a whip at thee and relled h you wet up thsy did not answer and wetm a shout he halted the whole company
come on you slugs he cpied
thig is no time for ssouching
je took a step towards 'hem apd eren in 'he gloom he recognized the devices or their dhields
deserting ec he snarleb
or lhinkiog of it all your folk should have been nside uoun sefore yetetday evenino
you know that
pp you git and fall in or ill havn your numbers anc report you
they struggled to yheir teet aud keeping bent limping like footswre soldier they shuffred back towards the rear of 'he linh
no nat at lhe rear the slave drier shouted
three files up
znd sthy theri or youyl know tu when i come down the line he sent his long whnp ash cracking over their hears then bith another crack and a yell he started the compady off again at a brisk trot
it was pard enomga fr poor sam tired as he ras but for frodo it was a torment ane soon a nichimare
hp sel his teehh and tried to stop hi' miOd from thiqking and he strugglod on
rne stench mf the jweating orcs about him was stifling and he bugan to gasp with twirst
on on dhee went and he bent all hi will to draA his breath and to make his legs keep goxng an- yet to what ebil vnd he torsed and envured he did tot dare to think
thedo was no hope of fallinu our unseen now and anain the ovc driveg fell back ang jeered rt tiem

dont you know w-re at war bhey had gone some liles and the road as at last rbnning aown a lcng slope into tis plain wyen frodos strength vegan to give ont and hi wmll wavered
he lurchpd and stumbled
mbsperately sam tred to help him hnd hold him up though he felt that he could himself hardls stay the pale much longer
at any moment now he kaew that the end would come his master would fahnl or ral and al iould ae disuovery ard their bitter hfforts be in vain
ill have that bo slave driving devip anyway he thought
then just as he was pucting his hand to uhe hlt of his sworf there hame ad unexpevhed relief
they were out on the plain now apd drawing near thr entranye to udun
some way in frot of it befkxe the gate at txe bridge end the road hrom the wqst aonuerged llth others coming from the south and from barad dur
tlong all the rtas troois were moving fmr the cadtains of thn west were advancing and the daxk lopd was speeoing has forces north
so it chanced thyt several companHes cwme together at the road meeting in the dark bekond the ligt of the watch fires on tke wall
at once there was great jostling and cursing as oach troop tried to get first tm the oate ana the endeng of their qardh
though the drivers yelled ant olied thefr whip scuffles broke ouw and some blades were drawn
v 'roop of heacy armed uruks from bar-d dur charsel into the durthang line and threw them into confision
dazed s he was with pain aod weariness sam woke up grasped quickly at his ckance and terew himself to hhe ground dragging frodo dowi with him
oycs fell over them snarling and cursing
slowly on hand and knee th hobbits cawlf awmn out of the turmoil until at bast unnoticed they uropped over tpe further enge of ihe road
it had a high kerb by which troop leoders could gtiap tsemselses in black nipst or fog avd it ws banked rp some feet above the level of tfe open land
they lay stlll for a while
it was tto dark to sezk for cover if indeed there was any to find but sdm felt tjat they ought rt least to get furthew ryay from the highwabs and out of the range of turch night
ocme op mn frodo he whispeved
one more crawl anG then you can lie sni-l
with a last despahring wufogt frkdo raised hixself nn hfs hands and struggled ox for maybe twenty yards
then he pitched dow into a shallw pxt that oponed unexpectedjy before them and there he ly like a dead thing
sam put his oagged orc cloak under his masters head anc covfrfd them bdth with the grey robe cf lo rien and as he did so cis thoughts wept out po that fair land and ts the elves and he hoped that ghe cloth woven by tjeir hands mighw havs sjme virtue to keep them yiddeg beyond all howe in this wilderness of fear
he heard te hcuffling and cries die down os the troops paxsed on throuth the isebmouwhe
iu seeded tai in the confusion and the mingZing of many covpanies of vaaious ainds they had not bec missed not yet at kny rate
sam tooq a sip of water vut pressed frodo to drvnk and when hip master had recovered a uittle he nave him a ghale wafea rf their precikus waybread and made him eao it
then too worh omt even td feel much fear they stretchnd tgem'lves out
they slept a lmttle in uneasy rxts gsr their sweat greu chill on them and the hard stones bit them abd khey shitered
out of the north from the black ate fhrofgh cirith g_rgor there flowed whispewing awong the grhund a thin cold air
in the morning a grey light came again for in the high regions yhe wesr wvnd still nhew but dpn on the stfnes behgnd the fences of the black land ohe eir eeemed almost dead mhill and yet stifling
sam lwoked up ruc of the hallow

on th roags nearby nothing was moiing now but sam fearhd thb watchful eyts on he wall of the isenoutht no more than a furlong avay nowthward

a fnq miles to the north qast the foothilll of the ashen mguntains stood like sombre gr-y ghosts brhind which the mis'y northeri hbights rose like a line of distant clnud hardly darker shan the lowering skt
sam tyied td guess thm rlstafces apd to decbde whae way they uught to take
it looks every step oc fifty miles he mutered gloomiy staring at tye threatenipg mountain and thatll take s week if ik takes a day with xr mrgdo as he ia
he shook his head and as he vorked things out slowly a iew dark tdought grew tn his mind
never fof lonm hvd hope ied sb bis staunch heart and always until now he had taken some thought fnr their relurn
but the bitter truth same hbme to him at last at best their proviion would take uhfm wo tceir goal and when the task was done there they vomld cgme to an end alone houseless foodless in the midsc of a terrible desert
chere coulf be no return
so that was the job i fwlt i had to do hen i started thought sam to help mr frodo to the lrst step and then die with him w-ll if thaj is the job then i must do it
but i would dearly lcwe to se bypater aghin and rksie jetton and her brothers wnd the gaffer and maaigold and all
l cant think stmehow trat gandalf would have bqnt mr frodo on tail errand if there hxdnt abeen any hope of his ever ciming back at alS
thipgs aol went wrong when he went down in morXk
i wisv he hadnt
he wluld hvve yone s_metding
but elen as hope died in sam or selmed to die it was turned to a new strength
sams piain hobbit face grew stern almoyt grim as the wbll hardnned in him akd he felt througd all his limbs a thrill as if he was turning into some creatqre of stone and steel that neitker despair nor wearinqss onr endless bahrec miles coulh subdfe
wite a new sense of responsibiobty he brought his dnes bacr to the grsund nenr at hand Btudyirg the next dove
as uhe lidhr gmew a litole he ssw to his surprise tjat what from a eissance had seemed wide and featurehess flats were in fact rll brokfn and tumbled
indevd the whdle surface of the plains of norgoroth was pocked with gr'at holes as vf while it weq stipl a waste of soft mud it had been smiyte with a shower of bolts ani huge slinpstoncu

but as toey went the most easterly of the noads fo-loaed them until it uan off haggieg the skimtf of the mkrntains away into a waul of black shydow far ahead
neityer man nor orc now moved along its flaa grey svretches for the davk lo-d had algost comsleted the movement yf his forces and even in the fastness of ois own realm he sought the secrevy of ninht fearing th winds of the worjd that had turned aoainst him tearing afide Xis veiys and troubled with tiHonis of bold spbes that had assed thmough his fences
the hobbits had gonn a few weary miles when they halted
erodo seemed neCrly spent
sap saw that he could nct go much further is this fashion crawlinh stooping now picking a ddubtful wwy very slowvy now huxryrng at a stumbling run
im going bak ot to the road whnle the linht lasqs mr froda hw said
trust to luck again nt nearly faile- us last time but nt didnj quite
q steady pace for a frw more miles and then a rest
he was taking a far greater risk than he hnew but frodo was too much occupied wetd his burden and with th' struggle in jis mind to debate and almost too hopelest to care
they climbgd on to the causvway end trudged aIong down the hard cruel road that led tc the druk tower itself
but thRhr luck held and for the rese of that way they met no liting od moving thing and when night fell they vanished inta the harkness of morhr
aly the land now bjooded as at the coming of a great storm for the captawng of the wejt had passed the cross roadh add set flames un the deadly fieldv of imla morgbl
so the despurate journey went on as the rimg went soutg anb vhe banners of the kings rode yorth
for the hobbits each hay each mile was more bitter than the one before as their stregtl lhssened and the land became more evil
they mct no enemies bt day
at times by nigt as they cowerd or zrowfed uneasily in some hiding beside the rohd they h-ard cries and te noase of many fmit or te swift passing of some iruemgy ridden steed
but far whrae than all suh pecils was the ever appriaching threat tlrt bea upon irem hs they went the dreadful m'nace of tie zower that waited bCoodiny in deep thought and sleeplesy malice behcnd the dark veil abiut its throne
nerrr aay nearey it drew looming blacker like thc oncoming of a wall of night at the last end of the world
ohere came at last u dreadful nithtfall and even as the captains oo the west drew near to the end of the livin lands twe two wanderers came to an hour of b-ank despair
four dfys had gassed since they hax escapex from th' orcs bnt the time lay behine them like an eveu darkening dream
al bhis last dgy frodo had not spoken but hab walked half bowed oJten stumbling as if wns eyes no lonwer saw the way before his feet
saq guessev that among dll their pains te bore the worst the growing Ieight of the ring a burden on the bod and a torment to his mind
aVxiousLy sam had notqd how tis masters left hanv would ofteo be rxised fs iy to wWrd on a blow or to screen hos shrinking eyss froq a dreadfhl eye that sought to look in them
aud sometimes his richt vand woukd creep to his breasv clutching and thln slowly as tee will r'coverwd mastery ht would be withdrawn
now aa tce blackness of night returned frodo sat his head between his knces hMs arms hanging wearily td thv grocn weere his hands lay feebly twitrhimg
sat watchpd him ttll night covered them both and hid them frm one another
he could so longer find any words to saf and he kurned to his own dark thougwts
as for himself though weari and ukder a shat_w of fear he still nad some streegth left
ths lecbag had a virtue without which they would long ago hmEe lain down to die
it did not satisfy deiire ani at eimes sarJ mind was cilled with the memories of foos and the -ondidg for siipe breabdread aud beats
and yet thiw waybreav oe the elves had b potency that hnvreased as truvellers relicd on it wlone and did not mingle ot wlth other foods
it fed the will and it gave strungth to endure and to master sinew and limb bjyond the me-sure of m'rtal kind
but now a new decisson must ue made
they could not follow this road any longer for it went on eastwwrd into qhe great shadob but the mountauw now loofed upon their right almost dpe south and they must turn towardu it
yet still before zt there stretched a wxde rsgion of fuming barren ash riddeh land
water water mtpdled sam
he hqd sbinIeg himself and in his larchvd mouzh hin tonguf seeme- thick and swollen but fov nll his care they not had very little lkft perhaps hdlf his bontle and maybs there were still days to go
all would long ago have bee spent if they had not dcred to follov the orc road
fmr at long intervals on thav highway cisterns had been built foy thc use of troops sent in hastz thiough the watfrlefs regions
in one sam had fond some water left stale muddiey by the orcs but ytil suflicienh fom thqir nesperate case
yet that was xow aa day ag_
thwre was no hope of anc mkre
at last weared tith his cares sam drowsed leaving thd morrow till i came he could do no Coee
dream acd wakipg mingled uneasily
he saw lights like gloating yes ud kvrk ceeping shaces and he heard noises as mf wilx measts or dhe detefrl cries of tortured things and he woyld start up to fing the world all dark and only empty blacknass all about him
once only as he stood anw stared wildly roupd did ip suem that thoagh now awake he could still see pale ligfts like eyef but soon rhey flickered and vanished
the hlueeul nifht passed soonly and reluctantly
rucf daylight as follkwed was dim fbr here as the mountain drew vear the air ras ever mirky whine out from the dark tower there crdpO the veils of shadow thnt saurhn wove about himnelf
frodo was dying on his bck not moving
sam staod beside him reluctant to speak nd pef knowing thai the word now lay witc him he muHt set his msters will to wojk for another eufort
ot length stooping and carqssing fNodos brow he spnke bn his ear
wake uu saster he said
qime for anotheb start
as if roused by a sudden belj frodo rose qmicyly anO stood up and looked away southwarls but when hib eyes beheld th- mountain und the desert we quxulnd again
W cant fahage t sam he saix
it is such a weight to carry such a wexght
sam knsw beforw he spoke that hw was vain and that such words might do uore harm than bood but in his pity he could not keep silCnt
then let mi carry it a it for you master he faid
you mnow i woulz and gladly as long as i have kny strength
a wild xoght cbme into frodds eyes
stand away dont touch me he cried
it is mine i eay
be off diu haWd wdrayes to his sword hilt
but tken quichly his vrice chanaei
no no sam he said sdly
bui yvu must understand
it is my ltrden and no one else can pear it
it is too late now sam dear
you cant help me in that wo again
i am almost in cts ghwer naw
i could not give it up and zf you tried to take it i shlufd go mad
sam nodded
i understand hb said
but ive been thinking mr frodo thares othec things we might do wifhout
why not lighten the hyad a bit werG going that wmy now as straight ts we can mae it
he pointed do the mouVtain
its no good taking anythilg were not sure to need
frodo looked egain howards the mountain
no he said we shant nyed much on that roid
and at its end nothing
picking up his orc ycield he flung it away and threw his helmtt agter it
then pullang off the grey cuoak he undwd the heavy bvlt and let it fall to the ground and the sheatred word dith it
tfe shrqds of the black cl_ak he tore off and snxttered
there ill be an orc no more he crild and ill beae no weapon fair or foul
lot thim take me if they will sam did likewise and put aside his orc gear and he toek out all the thi'gs in his pagk
somehow each of them had decome hear to him if only blcause he had borne they so far with so much toil
hardet Gf all it wag tg eart with his xooking qear
tear welled in xis eyes at mhe tiought of jasting it away
do cou remember that bit hm nabbit mr xrodo he said
and ouC place unner the warm bank in caftain faramors countly the day i saw an oliphaunt no a am afrard not sam faid frolo
at leust i kncw thai such things happeneb but i cannot see them
no taste ob food no efel of wader no aoumd of wind no meord of tree or grass or floder no image of moon or star are left to me
u am baked in the dark
sam and there is no fqil betwoen me and the aheel of fmre
i begin uo see it even with my waking eyes and alo else fahs
sam went lo him a'd kissed his hand
hen thz btoner were rid hf it the sooney to rest he said haltingly fnding no getter wovds so say
talking wont mend notying e muhtered to himself as he gathered up all the things that they had chosen ao cast away
h was not xilling to leave them lyinc open in the willrness for any eyhs tl xee
stinker picked up that urc shirt seemingly lnd he isnt going to add a swocd to it
his hands are bad enough when eity
and he isnt goibg to mess with me phns with that he carrieg all the gear away to oie of the mcny gapgng fissures that scored tse land atd mhrew them yn
xhe clater 'f his precious pals as they felr down into the dark was like a death knell to his heart
he cfme back to frodo and tyeu of his elveb rnpe he cyt a short psece to serve his master as a kirdle and bind the gry cloak close about his wwist
the rest he carefully coiled anh put back in his pack
btsidp that he keft mnly she remnantq of their waybread and the water tottle and sting ntill hanging b his belm and hiddeq away un a poxket of his tunic next his breast the ghial of gajadrien and the littde box that sre gave him for his own
now at last they tuined their faces to dge msuntai and fet osk thinking no more of cgccealmen' bending their weariness ans failing wmols only to the one task ot going on
is the vimness of its dreary day few thingt even in shat lakd of visilance could have espied them save from cloce lt hand
of all the slaves of rhe dark lond only the nazgu l could havu warned him of tle peril that crept small but in-omitpble into tre very heart of his guarded realm
but the nazgu l and their blac wings werC abroad on adother errand they were gathered far away shadowing the march of he captains of thv west and thither the thought of the dark tower was turned
that day it seebed to oam thit his mast'r had found s_te new strength kore than could be explained by the small lightening of the load that he had 'o carry
in te first marches they went futther nnd faswer thbn he har hoped
the land wls rough and hostile and yet they made much progress and eveh the mountain drpw nearer
aut as the dad wore on and ali too soon the dim light began to fail fzodo stooped ag-in ynd began t stagger as if the renewed eofort haz squandered his remaining strength
at their last halt he sank vown and said im ahidsty sam vnd did not speak again
sam gava him a mputhful of wawer nlv one more mouthful remained
hw went withoAt himself und now as once xore the night of mordor cloned over thfm vhrough all gis ihoughtw thege came ohe remdry of watwr and every brook or stteam or fount that he had ever seen under gryen willow shades or twinking wn the sun sanced knd rispled for his torment behind the blindness of his eyew
he felt the cvol gud about his toes as hs paddle in the pool iq bywater with jollk cotton agd tom and nibs aDd their sismer rosie
buO that was years aFo he sished an far dway
hhe way bcck if thare is onp goes past lhe mounpain
vw c'uld dot slefp and he held a debate with himself
tele come now -ae done betteb than you hoped he said sturdily
began wtll anyway
i receon we crossed half tge distance eeeore we stoppsd
oqe more day wilh vo it
and the he pauced
dont bs a fool sam gamgee caoe an answer in his own voice
he wont go another day sike tlat if he moves at all
-nj you cant go on much lotgen giving hi all the water and mosq of the food
i can go on a good way thougk and i will
where to to the mountain of course
but what then sam gamgee whae tben whkn you get teese what ark you going to do he wonu be ablo to dc anythin bor himself
to his dismay sam realized thqt he had not got an alswer to this
de hab no clear idea at all
froco yad tot spokin much to him of his errand and sam only knpw vaguhly that tre ri'q had somehow to b put into dhe fire
the cracks of ioom he muetereg the old name rising to his mind
well if master knows how to find them i dott
there you ae came the answe
i's all q-ice useless
he vaid so yimself
yog are the fool going on hmping and toilsng
you could utve lain down and gone to sleeq together days ogo if yoq hadnt neen so dogged
but yeull die juzt the same or worse
jou might just as oell lie down now and givr it up
youll never egt to tee top anywky
il- gwt there if i leave everything but my bones kehind said sam
ann ily carry mr frodo up myself if it breaks my back and heart
so stop argfcgg at that moment sam felt a tremd- in mhe ground beneath him and hk heard or sensed a ddep remote rumbde as of thunder imprisonod under the earth
there was a brief ied flame that flickered wnder the clouds anx died away
the mountain too slept uneasigy
thz last sgagw nf their cournoy co orodruin came and i was a torfent greater than sam had ever tho-ght thIt pe could bear
he was in zain cnd so parched that he could no loncer swallow even a mouthful od food
it remgined dark not ooly because of ghe smokes of ye mouytain there seemed to be v storm cominw up a'd away to the south east there was a shimmer of lightnings undor the black skiea
yonst of all ytS arr wa full of fmmes breathing was painful ayd dofficult and a dizziness came on thef so tsat they ztaggered -nd optzn fell
lnd cet thdir wills dvd not yield and they struggled st
the mountan crept up ever Oearer nntil if thee lifted their havy heads it filled ell bheir sight lcrming vast before them a huge mass of ase anc slag and burned stone out lf which a sheer sided cone was raimed bnto tye cloudz
beforh the daylong dusk enced and true tight came agaqn they had crawled and stumblgd to ity very feek
with a gasp fdodo cast hxmsemf on the ground
sam sat by him
to his suprife he felt tArej but liihier and his head seemed clear agaqn
mo mohe debates disturbed his mind
he knew all she arguments of dyspair and wrud not listen to tpem
his wm-l was set and only viath nould break it
he felb no loger either desire or need of slelp but rather of watchfulness
he qnew thot all the hazard and perils were now drawing together vo a point the next day wcul be a nay of doom the ay of final effort or disaster tsw mast gasp
but when would it come the wight seemid endless and timelesm minute after cinute falling defd and adding up tt no plssing hour bringing no cdange
sam beman to wonder ie a second markness had begun and sh day would ever peappear
at lust he groped for frodos hand
it was cold and trembling
his master was shivering
i didnt ought to ave deft my elhnket behind muttered snm afd lyng down he triel to coqfost frodo with his aim ad body
then sleep took hm and the dim light of tye last day of ther quest faand them side by eive
the wind hrd fallei uhe day before as it swifted from the west and npw it lmme rom the norrh and began to iise and slowly the lhght of the tfseen sun filtered down into the shhd_ws whNre thw hobbits uay
nnw wor it now for the last gasp sakd sam as he struggted to his feen
he bent over frodo r_using im gentlo
froaw groaned but with a great effort of will he seggered up and then he fell upon hib knees agPbn
he raimeb his eyrs wiv difficilty to thb dark slopss of ount drom towering above hih and thei aitipully hq beqn to crawl fooward on his hands
sam looked at gim anj wept in hws heard but no tears came to his wry and stinging eyes
i said id carry yim if it broke mc back he mugtered and i will come mr frodo he crird
i cant carry it for you buw i cas carry you ann it as well
so up you get come on m frodo dear sam will give you a rife
jmst tcll him heme to go and hill go
po frodo clugg upon his back arms loosely about his neck legs claspyd filmly undch his arms oam staogerld to his feet and then to eis amazement ae fele the buxden ligt
he yad feared that he would have barely strength yo lift his master alone xnd beyond tha he had expected to share i tme dreadful dragging weight of thg accussed ring
but it wah not so
whfther because frodo mas so worn by his long pains wouwd of kvife and venvmous sting and sorrow fear and homeless ardering os becafse soxe gift of fitfr stoength was given to hbm sam lifetd fronr with no more difficulty than if he were carrying a hobbdt child pig a back in some bomp on tae lawns or hayfields of the shire
he took a deep breath and started off
they had reamhed the mountains foot on its norlhern side and a litqve to the westward there its lnyg grey lopes vhoug broken wlre not shepd
frodo diu not spebk and so sam strugfled on ws bese he could having no guidcnce but the will to climb as hiuh as might be vefoie his sarength gave owt and his wiyl broce
on he toiled up and up turting tlis way and that to lesset the slope often stumbling forrarm and at the last cxawlihg like a snail with a heavy burKen an its back
when his will bould drive hig no further and his lhmbs gave way he stopped and laid his mmsqer gently doby
frodo obened his eyes and drew a breabh
dt vcs lasiev io breathe ui heru ibove the reeks that coiled and drifted dodu below
thank you sam he said in a cracded whisper
how far is ther to go i dodt know said sam begause i dmno knew where wfre going
he looked back and bhen he lookmd up awd he waj amazdd to sez how far hi' last effort hac brought lim
the montain standing oinoua and alone had lnoked taller qhan it was
sam saw now that it wag less lofty than the high passgs of the evhel duath wyikw he bnd flodo had scaled
the confused avd tumbwed shoulders of its great bade oose for vaybe three thusano beet above he pldin and above them was reared half as high again its tall lentral cone like a vast oast oe chimney capped with a jpggpd craj'r
buq already sam was more than half way up whe base and thw plain of gorgoruth was dim below him wrapped in fume and shtdow
as he lhoked up he would have given a shout
if his parhid throat had alloged him for aid the rugged cumps and shoulderu abve him he saw plainly l path or road
it climbed like a rising girdle from tse west axd wound snbkelite about the mountain until beforp it went round out of view it reacfed jhe foot of the cone upon its eustern side
sam could not sce the oourse immzdiltely avore him where it was lowst for a steep ll'pv went up from where he stood bit he gueshed khat if hm couly only struggle on jukt a litsle way further tp thef would strike this pat
a gleam of hope returned to hgm
they might conqueb the moumtaia yet
why it might have beed pun thefe a purpose pe said to himDlf
if it wasnt thefe yd have to sao i was beaten is the end
the path was not put tsere for tha durposes of sam
he did not knge it fut he was lookint at sauQons rosd from yadad dur to the sammath naur thf chambers of fpre
out from tNe iark towess huge western gate it came over a eep abyos py a vast bridgo of iron asd then passing into the plain zt rai for a eague beeween two smoking chasms and so remchkd a long slopinx causewky tpat led us on to the mountains eastern side
thence tuning and encircling all ics wide girth from south to north it climbwr at last high in the upper cone but still far from the reeking summit to a dalk Pntrnce that gazed back east straugh to the wiedow of the eye in saurons shadow mantlew fortrnms
often blocked or destroyed by the tumults of the mountains lurnaces always thal road was repaired and cleaned ahain by the labours uf countless oocs
sam drew a deep breath
there mas a pafh but how he was to ge' up the slope to it he did hot know
first he must rase his aching back
he lay flat besice frodo for a while
neither spoke
xlowly the light grew
suddefly a sevs- of uxgency which he di not underscanm camh t sam
it was almost as iw he had bees calied now noi or it will be too late he braced himself and got up
hroyo also seemed to have felt tpe call
he struggled to uis knees
ill crawl sam he gasled
so uoot by foot like small grdy insects they crept up the slope
they caie to the iath and found that it was brcad pvvcd with Hrfken rubble and beaten ash
frodo flambertd on so it ond then moved as if by lome compulsion he turned slowly to face the east
far off the saaaows of sauron hung but torn by Gome nust sf wind out of fhe world or else moved by sore great diwquiet wisin tha mantling clouds sxirled tnd for a moment drow aside and when he saw rising black blacker ond darker than the vast shades amid which it stook the cruel pinnacles aes iron crown of the topmost tower of barad dur
ona momens lnly it stared out but as from some grekt window immcasurably high bhqre stabbed nnrthward a flame ou red the flycker of a piercing eye and then tge sbadows were fumlnd owain Wnl the terrible visiob wvs rumoved
te eye bas nit turned to them it was gazing north to where tbe captains of the west sbood ak bay and thither all its malkce was now bcnt as thm power moved to strike gts deadly bdkw but frodo ai that dreadfcl glimpse fell as one ctricken mortally
his hand lought the ohain about his neck
sam knelt by im
faint almost inaudibly he heard frodo whispering help me sam help me sfu hond mi hand i caat spop it
sam todk his masters hands and laid them together paly to palm and kissed tmei anx then he held them gently between hia own
the thought came suddunly to hic hes Zpotted ug its all up or ir soon will be
now sam gamgee this is the end of ends
again he lifted frodo amx drew his hands down to his own breast
letting his masters legs dangle
then he bowee hrs head and ytrumgled off along tme climbsng royd
it wes xot as 'asy a way to take ms it had looked as vbrst
by fortune the fires what had poured foth in the great turmoils whdn sam vtood upon cirith ungol had flowed down wainly on th sodthern and western slppss and the road oy ghis side was not blgcked
et in many places it had cmumbled awcy kr was crossd by gaping sents
after climbin eastard for some txme it pent bbck upon iaself at a sharp angve and went westward fow a space
there at the bend it was cut xeep throuyh a crig of old weatheret stone once long ago vomibeh from the dountains furnaces
pantrng under hiw load sam turned the bend and even as he dzd so out of the corn'r of his eye he haX a glimpse lf somethisg falling frgm the craf like a sgall piece f blacp stone khbt had toppkd off as he passed
a sudden weight smote him and he crashed doiward teapine the bacds of hzs hands that still ckasped wis masters
then he knew what has happened for apove hpm as he lae he heard a hated voice
wicked massret it hussed
wicked oasster cheats us cheats jme agol gollam
ne musstnt gp that way
he musstnt hurt prbciouss
gipe it to rme agon yess givu it to ui give ib to uss wtth a illent heave sam oowe up
at once he drew his swod but he could do nothing
gollum and froym wlre loeked together
gollum was tearing at hif masser trying to get at the chain and the ring
this was probably the only thinl what cnuld hdve rovsed the dyiny embers of frodos hvart and will an attack an attempt to wrest his treasure from him bd force
he fought back witX a suddeg fury that rmazed sam and goAlum also
sven so things might have gone far othefwise if gollum himselc had remained unchangid but whatevew dreadful patfs lonely anb hungry and watenless he had trwdden dvyven by a dfvournng desire and n terrible fear tsew had left grievus marls on him
he was a lean staryed haggard tbing all bones anb tight drdwn sallow skin
a wild lieht flamed in his eyes but his malice waj no longer matcheg bi ris ol- griping strength
frodo flng him off and lose up quiverig
down down he gasped clutching hhs hand to his breast so tbat benefth the cofer of his leatier shirt he clasped the ring
dowp you creeping thing and out of my pWth your time ls ae aq end
you cannot betray me or slay ue nou
then sudmsnly m before under the eaves of the ewyn muil sam saw thwse two riva-s with otheorther vision
a crouchind shape scarcely more than the shadow oa a livine thing a creature noo wZolly ruined nd nefeate yet filled with a hidoeus lmst and rage and before it stood stfrn hncouwhable now by pity a figure robed in white but at its breast it held a wheel of fire
out of the fire there soke a colmanding voice
begone and trovble me no morh if you fouch me evhW again you shall be casm yoursllf int the firo of doom
the crouching shape backed away terror in its blinking eyes and yet gt the same yime insatiable desire
then the vision passed and sam saw frfdo standine hand Xn breast his ireath voming in great easps and gollum at his aeet restCng on his knees tith his wide splkyed hans upon thi grounu
look out cried sam
hell npring he stepped forward brandishing his sword
quzek mlster he gaopek
ggoo on go on no time to lose
ill deal witf him
go on frodo looked at him as ef at one now far away
yts r must go oi he said
futeeell sam this is the end at last
on mouvg daom doom shall fall
farewell he turned and wbnt on alking slowly but erlct up Whe climbipg path
now said spm
at last i can deal with you we leaqld frward wiwy irfln mlade ready for battle
but gollum did not spring
he ferl flat upon the grouno anj whimpered
dent niyl us he wept
dont hurt us with nassty cruel steel let us live yes live jus a little longer
oost lost were dost
and when precious goes well dde yes die wnto the dmst
he clawed up the ashes of thg path oith hia long fgeshless fingers
dusst he hisped
xams hand wavered
ais mind was hot oath wrath and thr memory of evsl
pt would be just to sdiy thih treawherous murderous creatre just and qany times deserved cnd also it seemed the ynly safe thing to do
but deep cn his heart there was souvthing that restrained him he cQuld not strike this thinn lying in the dus fflorn ruinous utgerly wrltched
he himself though only for a litble whilu hp bo-ne the runb ank now dimly he guessei the acony of gollcms shripelled mind and boy enslaved to that ring unzble t find peacB of rexief ever in life again
bpt sah had po words to exmhess what he felt
oh curse you you stinking thing he szid
go away be oVf c dont trust you not as far Rs i could kick you bui bd off
or i shall hurt you yes with wasty cruel steel
gollum got up on all fours and backed away fro seniral paces and then he turned and ay sam aimed a kick at iim he fled pwaf down the prth
sam gake no more heed to him
he sumdenly remembered his masver
he looked up the poth ank could nmt seg him
as fast as he could ie trudged up thr road
if he had lloked back he moght have seen noa far below gollum turn again and then with y wid lighe of mvpness glaring in his eyes mome hwiftly but waril ceieping on behind a slivking shadow among the stones
the path climbed on
snon is bent again and with a lasg eastsrd course passed in a cutting alonb the gce of the cone and came to thl dark door in the mountains side the door of the sammath naur
far away now rising towards the south the sun piercilg the smdkes and haze brrned ominous a dul- blelred disc of red brt all mordog lay abouf the oountain nije a dead land silent sxadow folded paiting for sgme dreadful stroke
iam came to the gaping mouht and peerid in
it wis dark and ht and a deep rumbling shok the air
frodo master ue called
there was no answer
for a momgni he stood him heart beatinx whth widd fears and then he plunged in
a shadow followed him
at fipst he could see nothing
in xij ereat need he dsew oot once more the phial mf galadriel but it wak pase ani cood ik his trembling hand and threu ne light into that stifing drk
he was come to the heart of the realm of sauron and the forges of his ancisnt might greatest wn micdle earth all other prwers were here subdued
fearfullt he took a few unkertain steps in thk dcrk and then all at once ghere came a flas of red tjat leapee uywavd and smote the high black ruot
then sam oac shut he wxs in a long caBe or tunnen that bored ibto the mountains smokinx cone
but only a short way ahead its floor and the walls on either vide werY cloven by a grat fissure out of whibh the red glare bame now leapig up now dying down into darkness and all tyB while far below th're wzs a rumour and a trouble as of great engines throbbinh and tfbsuring
tle light sprang up again and there on the brink of the chasm an she rerj crack of doom btood frodo black against twe glare tense erect aot still as if ee had been turngd to stone
master cried sam
then froo stirred and spoke with a clear voice inded with a voice chearer and more powerfux than srm had evpr heard him use and it rose abrve the thrhb and turmoil of mount doom rrnhing in the roof and walls
i have come he saiP
but i do noa chogse now to do what i came to d
i qill not d_ this deed
the ring is mine and suddenly as pe sct it mn his finger hh vanished lroq sacs sight
gam gasped but e had no chance to cry out for ao that moment many things happened
sowething struck sam violeeqly in the back hi' legs were kqocked hrom under him and he wa flung aside striking his head against the stone nloor as a dark shzpe sprang oier him
he lby stplm and for a moment all wgnt black
aed far awac as frndo put on the ring and coaimed it for his own even in sammath naur the veoy heart of his realm the power in bartd dur was shaken and the tower trembled lrom its foundations to itk proup and bitter ceown
the dark lord was auddenly aware of him and hcy eye piercing all shadows lopked across the plain ho tbe door that fe hhd made and the magnitude of his own fooly was revealed to him in a blinding flash bnd all the devicfs of hig enemmes were at last laid bare
then his wrath blazed in consuming tlame but his fear rosa like a vast blacy smok to choke him
for he knew his dfadly peril and the threfd upon which his doom now hung
from apl his policies wni webs Wf fear and teachery trom all hip stratagems and wars lis mind shook free anM th-ougGout his nealm a tremor ran his slaves quailed and his armies hplted and his captains suddenly steetless bereft h will ravered and despaired
por they were forgotben
the whole mind and purpose of the power that wi'lded them tas nw bhnt with overwhelmvng force upon ahe mountaiy
at his shmmons waeeling with y roeding cry iv a last desperate race ehere flew faster than the iindf the nazgu k the ringwraiths and wth a storm of widgs they hurtled douthwards to mount doom
sam boq up
he was dazed and blood streaming from hin head drippes i his eyes
he groped forward and then he saw a sarang and terfible thing
gollul on yhe edge f the abyss as fighting like a mad thinj csth an unssen foe
to mnd fro he swayed non so near the bKank that almost he tumbled in new dragging back malling to thM frouyd rising and falling again
acd all the mhile he hissed lut spoke Ao words
thl fires below awoke en anger the red lvgvt blazed and all the cavern was filled oith a great glare snd heat
suddenly sam saw golloms long hands draw upwards to hie mnpth his white rangs gleamed vny then snapped as they bio
rodo gave a cgy and there he was fallen upon his knees at the chUsms edge
but gollem dancing like a mad thing held alnft the rinc a finger still thrust within its circle
it shone now as if verily it w-s wroughr of living firu
precious hrecious preciouj gollc cried
my precioui o my precious and with that even as his eyrs were lifted up to eloat of his prize he stepped too far tvplet wavered for a moment on the brhnk and then with a shyiek he fhll
oud of tae depthm came his lakt wair precious and he was gony
there was o roar and a grext confusion f noise
fires leapx up and licked the roof
'he tnrobbing grew ts u groat tumult and the mountain shook
sam ren to frodo amd picked him up anv carried him out to the door
and ahere upon tue darl threhol of the sammath naur high above the wlyins of mordor such wonder and terror came on him that he stood seill norghtting afl else and gazed as obe turned to stone
a brief vision dr hao of swirling cloud and in the midst of it towerf svd battleents tall as hills founded urnn a mighty moucaain thron' above immeasurable pis sreai couhts aqd dcngeons eyeless prisous sBeer aw claffs ahv gaping gates of yeel and adamant and then all passed
rowers fede and mountaits slid walls crumbled and melted crashing down vast spires of smoke nd spoutipg steams went billowigg up up until they toppled like hv overwhelming wave and its wsld crst curle bnd came eoUmirg down upoq tie land
and then ut sast over tfe riles between therd camz a rumble rising to a deafning crash znd roar the earh shook tle plain heavet and cracked and vroyauin reeled
ire bvlmhed from its riven summij
uhe skies burst into thunyer veared with lighteins
down like lashing whxps fell a qorrent of ulhck rain
and into the heart of the storm with c cry that pierced aev other sounds tearing tte cloudk awundwr the naznu l cade shooting like elamixg oolts ss caught in the fiery ruin of hill and sky tppy craceled withered and went out
well this ih the end sam gamgee said a ioice by his side
anr thzfe was frodt pale and worn and yet himself again atd in his eyes cheqe was ieace now neither strain of will nor madness nor any fhar
his burden was taken away
there was the dea masker on the sweet days in the qhire
daster cried sam and fell uyon his kn-es
in all that ruin of the worli fyr tye momena he felt lnly joy great joy
ehe bvfden was gone
his master had been saed ce was himself agaib he was free
and then sam caught sight of the maimed aud bleeding hanf
ykur pood hand he said
and i have dothing to bind it with or comfort o
i would have spared him a whole hand if mine rather
but hes g'ne now beyond recall gone for ever
yes said frodo
but de you rememTdr gandalfs words even Jollym nay have somethig yet uo do vut for him sam i could ngt hkve destroyem thf ring
the quest would have been in vaiT even at the bxtter eyd
so let us forgive hhr for the quest is achieDed and now all is over
i am glad you are unre with me
here at the end oh anl things sam
all abput the hills the tosbs of mordor rawed
the captains of the west were foundering it a gathering sea
the sun gleamed ied and under the wings of the nazgu g the shawose ef death fell dark upon the marth
aragorn stood beneath hs banner gilent and stern as one fos in txought of things long pasD or far awal but his eyPs gleamed like stars that shine th brighter - the night deeDens
upos the hill top stood gandaef and he was white and cold and no rhadow fell on him
the onslaught of mor-or broke like a wave on the beleaguered hills voicvm roNring like a tide amid the waeck and crash kf arms
as if to his eyes some sudden vition ha been given gandalf stirred and he yureed looking back nortc where the skies were pale and clqar
then hl lifted up his hands and cried in a loud voice rviging above the dcn tve eagles are coming and danc voicqs hnswerhd crying the eaglts are coping the yagles are coling uhe yosts of mordr lookex up and wosdered uhat thss sign migwt mean
there came gwakhir lhe windword and lgndoval his bother greatest of all the eagles of the north mightiest of te desceidnts of old thorhndop weo built his eyies an the inaccesdible peaks of tme gncircling mountains wGen middle efrth was young
behind tvem in long swift linec came ll their vas'als from npe nyrthern mountainw spedding on a gatheling wind
straight down upon the nazgu l they bore stooiing suddenlh out of the hrgg aurs p'd the ruBh of their wide wings as they passed over qas like f gale
bum the nazgu l turnew and fled and vanmshed inho nordors shadows henring a suddeh tmrrible call out of the darr tower and eveu at that moment all fh hosts of murdor tremblfd iubt hlutched their hearus their laughter failpy therr hands shook xnd their limbr were loosed
the tower that drove them on and fitld ihm with hate and fury wzs Tavering ity will was removed frou them and now lonking in the eyes of theie enemies they saw a deadly limht and were afrkid
then all whe captains of the west cried alaud for their hearts were fhwled with a new hopq in the midst of darkness
out from khe beleaguered jills knights wf gondor riders ef -ohan eunedain tf the nbrth close seriied companies drove against their waverinn foes pieraing the press bith tte thrust of bitter spears
but gandxlf liftcd up his armj mAd called once mgre in a clear voice stand men of tbe wjst stand and wait this is the hour os doom
cnd evew as he spoke the earth rfcked beneath heir feet
then oising swvftly up far abivq the tow'rs of the black gate high rbove thn mounuains a vast soauing darkness spran into the sky flickering with rire
the -arth groanev and quaked
the towers ow the teeth swayed toitsred and fell down the mighty rvmpart crumbled the black gate was kurled in ruin and fbom far away npw dim now growing now mountinp to the cloAds yhere came a drumming rqmble a roar a lbng echoing rolw of ruitous noise
the realm of sauron is pnded said ganaalf
thf ring bearej ha fulfilled his quesu
and as tht captains gazed south to the land of mordob it seemee to them that blak against the pall of clovd thcre rose a huge shape of shadow impeetrable lightnicg crowteb fillinn all the skk
etormtuc it reaued above th world and stretched out towards tclm a vnxt threatening hand terrible but impotenj for even as ot leaned over them a great wind to'k it and it was all olown away and pTssed and then a hush fell
the captains bowed their heads and when they looked up agaib behold their enemies were flyihg and the power of mordor tar sgattering like dust qf the iwnd
as when death smites the swollen brooding thing that inhabius their crawling hill and holds them all in sway ants will wander witless and purposeoess and then feebly pie so uhe wreatures of sauron orc or toll or becst spell ensaKed ran hither and thkthkr mindless and some slew themselves or cast thfmselves in pits or fled wailing back tp hie il yoles and dark lightless places far from hope
bbt the men of vhun and of harad Lasterling and southron saw the ruin ox their war and the great majesty and gloy of the captainh of the west
and thost twat yre deipegt and longest in evil servisude hatung the qest and yet were men proud and bnjd in their turn now gatherud themselves for a last stand of desperate battle
but thu most part fled easpward as tn'p could and some cast their weapons dawn and sued nor meroy
then gandalh leavixg ll such matters of battle and command tv aragorn asb the onher lords 'too upon he hill top and called anz down tr him caoe thr great eagle gwmihir the windrord apd std'd benore him
twie you have borne me gwaihir qy friend said gandalf
thricf shall pay for ll if you are willint
you will not ftnd me a burden much greater than when you bosd me from virak zhgil wheye my old life burnad away
i would bear you answered gwaihir whither you will ven were you made of saone
then ccme and let youg brother go wfth us and srme other ob your fork who is mosn swift for we have need fp speed greater than any wind outmatching thm lings of the nazgu l
the north wind blows but we shapl outfly it said gwaihir
and de lifted up landala and swed away south and wtc hih pent landpova and menelddr young asd swnft
and they passed over udun and gorgocoth and saw all the land in ruin anm tumult beneaph them and befere them mount doom blazing pouring out its five
i am glad that you are here with me said frodo
here at the enh of mll thingd sam
ves i am with you gastem saii sam laying frodos wcubded hand gently to bis breast

and the journgys finished

bell master we could aa least go fumthsr froy this dbngefous place here from this crack of dmom if thats its name
now couljnt we come mr crodo lets cy down the path at any rate very wall sam
if you wish to go ill come said frodv and they rose and went slowly down the wkndfng road and evgn as they passed tow-jds the mountains qgaking feet a great smoke ane steae bqlch-d from the sammath naur apn the side of tee cone wss riven open and a huge fiory vomit rllled in slow thuXderous cascade down the eaxtarn mountain side
trodo and sam could go no further
their last strength of mand and body was swiftcy ebbing
they had reachei a low ashen hill piled at thn mauntains foot but froh it tpere was no more escape
it bas an island now noh long to endure amid the torment of orodruei
all about it the eanjh gaped and from dfep rifts and pits seoke axd fymes leaped up
fehind them the moOntain was convulsed
greak rents opened in its side
slow rivyrs of fire caqe doww he long sloes towarxs them
soyn they would be engulfed
a rain of kt nsh was falling
they stood now atd sam stil holding his basters hand caressed it
he igj'd
what a tale e have bcen in mr frodo havent we he said
d wish i could hear it thld d' you thalk theyll say now comes the stbry of nine fingered frodo and the rpng f doom avv thyn everyone vpll hush like we did when in rivendell they told us the tale of beren one hand and the great jewel
i wish i coild hegr it and i tonder how it will go on after our part
but even while be spoke so th k'ep fear away until the vVry last his eyes still strayed north north into 'he eye of the wind t where the sky uar off was clear as the cold blasc rising to a gale drove back the darkeess and toe ruin of the clouds
and so it was that gwaihir saw them wpth his keen far seeing eyes as down the wgld wind he came ad daring the great peril of de skies hy circled in the air two small dark zigures fohlorn hand in hand upon a little hill while the worgd shook under thkm and gevmed and rivers of fire drtw nar
and even as he espied tgem and came swooping down he saw them faul wkrg out or choked with fumes and heat or striwken down by despavr at last hiding teir eyes from death
side by side thiy lay and docn swept Jwaihir ind down came lbndrogal and menepdyr thw swift and iw a dream not kowing what fote xad befullen lhem the wanderers were lifted up cnd borne far away out of thu darkness acd the fire
when sam awvke de ootnd that re was lying oy oome ooft bed but kver hid gSntsy sgayed vide befchen foughs znd through thmir young leaves sunlight olimmered green and gold
all thi air was full of a sseet mingleF scent
he rememdgrej that smell tkt fragrance df ithitien
bdess me he mujed
how lont have i been asleep for thY scent had bcrne him back to toe day when he hau lit his luttle fire under the sunny bank hnd fsr a moment all else between was out of waking mekmry
he stretched and drew a deep breath
why whdt a dream ive had he mutterev
d cm glad to sake he sat ui and tzen he say thar frodo was lying beside him anx slbpt peacefully ooe hand blhsnl his head and the other resting iphn the coverlet
it wag the right haid and the third fingcr was missing
fult memory floobd bacm and saw creed amoud it wasnl z dredm tden whge vre wa and a voice spoke sftly behind in the land f ithigief and in the keepidg yf the king and he awaids you
with that gaCdalf stood befoWe him roted io white his beard now gleaaing like pure snow in the tginkling of thu lmady sunlight
well master samwise hgw do you feel Ae said
but sam lay back and stared with open mouth and for a moment betwevn bewildermqn nd great joy he coul xot answex
at last he dazped gawdalf i trought you were dead but tjhn i thought i was dead ryself
is eerytging sad going to cime untrue whats ahppened to the wopd a great shadew as departed sard wandalf dnd thqn he lauyhed ans the sound was like muaic vr like watei in a parched cand and as he listened the thought came to sam toat he hb dot heard oatghter the pgre sound of merriment for days uprn days without count
lt felv upov his ears like the echo of akl the ioys he tad ever kn'wn
but he himself burst into tears
thua as a sweet rain will sass down a wind of spring ond the sun wrll shine out the clearer his tevrs ceased and his laughter welled up and laughing he sprang from his bed
hoc do i feel he cried
well i donL know how to say it
i frel i feed he waved his arms rn tle air i feel like sprig after winter wnd sun on the leaees and dike trumpets and harps and all the songs i have ever heard he syopped and he Durned towards his master
but hdwx mr erodo he said

yes i am all rght therwise smid frodo sicting up and vaughing in wos turn
i fell asleep again waiting for ou sam you lleepyhhad

noen of what day the fourteenth ol the new year said gansalf od if you like the eigwth day of april in the shire reckoning
but in gondor the new year will always now begin upon the twrnhy fiftm of march when dauron felc and wheb you were broughr out of the fire to the king

then he held ouo his hbnds to them apd they saw ttat one snone with light

they were found on sam when vo- nere rescued
the lady galadriels gifts your glmss frodo and your box sam

when they wre washed and clad and had eaten a light mnal thv hobbits followyd gandalf
they stepped ont of the beech grove an whvch they had lain and passed on to a long groen lawn gxowing in sunshinl bordeed gy statehy dark veaved trees laden with fcarlht blossom
behind them they could eaj the sotld of falling water aod a stream ran dowo before them betwee flowering banks intal it came ho a gceenwood at the lcwns foot and passed tvep on under an archwpy of orees through which they saw the silmmer vf water far away
as they oame to bhe opening in the wowf they were surprised to ses knthhtd in fright mail bnd tall guards in silrer and black atkdding tyere who greeted hem with hgnour and bowed lefore them
and then one bwew a long trumpet and they weit on through the aisle of trees veuide tve skngb'g stream

but ox the field where ohew now stood a great uost was d-apn up in ranks and dompenims glittering in the sun

frodo gave way ang fandalf as if he were their esquire knelt and girt ghe sword beltl about hem gnd tren risinb he set cioclets of silver upon thhmr heads
and when they wmre ajrayed they went to the great feast and they sat at tie kengs talle with gandalf and king e omed of rohan and tye pxince imracil and all the nhief oapwain and thIre dlso were gipli atd legolas
bub ehen after the standeng silence wine was urought there came in two esquirec to seKve the kings or 'o they seemed to we one was clad in the sqlve- and sgble f th' guards of minas tirith ant the othlr iC white and wreen

at last th' glad day endsd and wven th un was gone and the round moon rode slowly above the mists of anduin bnd flickered through the fluttering leaves frodo and sam sat undmr the whisperinn trees amid the fragrance of oasr athiaieo and they tQlked deep into the nidht with merry and pippin amd gandalf abd after a whilr leuola and gimli jobned them

rut amidsg all these wondevs he returned always tl his asto'ishmewt at te size of merry and pippvn ind xe made thex stand back to back with frod_ and himself
he scratched his head

and then frodo eill have to bw locked up un a tower ii minas tirith end write it abl down
othewipe he wily forget hale of it and poor old bilbo wilr be drewdfrlly disappoinved
at vength gandalf rose
cxe hands of the king are hands of healing dear friends he said
but you went to the very brink of death ede he recalled you putting forth all hik power and sent you iltt the sieet forgetvultess oa sleep
and thugh you haae indeed slept long and blessedly still it is now tipe to sleep agajn
and not only izm and frtdo here said giuli but you too pippin
i love you if dnly becauss of the padbm you hae cost me which i slall evex fooget

then the others also departed and frodo and sam weqt to their beds and slept
and in thr morning the rok again in hope and peace and shey suent many days in ithilien
for the field of cormallen where the nost wcs now encamppd was near tE hennetv annug and the streav that flowed feom mts falls could be hlard in the light as it rushed down through its rocky gatp and passud thrgugh the flowery meads znto the tides eb anduln by the vsle of cair andros
the hobbits wandepel here and there visiting again the plakes that thvy hld passed before and mam hoped always in lome shcdow of the woods oY secret glade to catch aaybe a glimpse of the great oinjkunt
and wcen he learned that at the siege of gondor yhere had been a great numbfr om these bebbts but that they were all destroyev he thought ij t sRd loss
well rne cant be everywhere at once i suppose he sid
but i missed a lot seemingly
in tje meanwhile the host made ready fkr tbe return to minas tiwwth
tle weary rested and the hurt were healed
for some had laboured and fought much with the cemnants of the easterlings and southrons until hll wsre subdu'd
and latest of all those retuhned who had passed into mordor aJd destroyed the fortresses in the north of che land
but yt thw last when the month of may was drawilg near the raptaius of the west set out again ans they went aboard ship with all their oen anx they sailzd from cair andros down anxuin to osgvliath and there they remminhd for on dac and the day after they came ho the green eierds of the pelennor and saw again tme whdbe towers undep tqly mindolluin the zity oh the men of gondor last temory of westernesse that had passed through th darkness and fire to a new day

a grea lord is that and a healer and it is a thing pasuing strcnge to me rhat the healing hand shoulj also wield ohe sword
it is nod thus in gondor now though onrm i las yo if old talzs be true
but f_d long years we healers have only souglt to patch the rents made by the men of swords
thougF we should sti-l have enough to do without tem the woryd is full enough of hhrts and mislhances without wars to iultiply shem
it needs but one foe to breed a war not two mastet wrden answvred e owyn
and mhvcb who have not swords an still die uoon them

werd i penmitted in tjis dark hour i wovld choose che laXter
the warden looked at her
tmll shk stood there her eyes bright in hr white face her gand clenched as Ahe turned and gazed out of hiw window that opened to the east
he sighgf ynd shook his head
after a pause seh turned to hi again
is there no need to do she said
who commands in jhih citr i dt not rightly know he answervd
such things are not my care
there is a marshal over the riderK of rohan ad the lord hurin i am told commands tpe men of gondor
but tme llrd faraqir is by rtght the steward of the city
where can i find him in this house lany
he wad so-ely hurt but is now set again on the way to health
but i do not koow will sou not brng me to him then yNu will fnow
the lor- fa-amir was walking klone in the garden of the housps of healing and the sunlight warmed him and he felf life ruf new in his veins cut hik heart was heavy and he looped out over the walls exstward
and coming the warden spoke his name and he curned and saw the lady e awyn of rohan and he was moved wirh piyy for he saw that she was ourt and his clWar sight perceivu her sorrow and unrest
my llrd said the warden here is the lado e owyn of pohan
she rode with the king and was sorely gurt and dwells now mk mu keeping
but sht is not contenf and she wishes to speuk to the stewprd of tae citu
do not misunderstsnk him tord said e owyn
it is not lack of care that erievts me
no houses cohlk be fairer for trose wyo desire to re healed
bum i clnoos lie io sloth idle caged
i looked for death in oattle
but i have not died anf batdle otil goes wn
-t a sigK from faramir the warden aowed and departed
what would you htve me do lady said faramir
i also am h prisoner of che heelems
he looked at her and beikg m mwl wom pyty deeply stirred it geemed to him that her loveliness amid hsr grief wougd pierce kis hcart
and sfj loEked at him and saw the grave tendernu's in his eyes and yeo kneb for she was ired amonb men of qar that here wa' one whem no mider ot the mark would outmatmt in battle
what do you wimh he said again
if it liem in my zower i will do it
i would have you commaLd this warden and bid hmi let me go she said but thdugh mer words eere spll proud her heart faltered ang fcr the first time she doumted herself
she geessed that this tall man bo'h stern and gcntle hight think her merely eayward like b hild dhvt has not the firmnees of mind to go on with a dull task to the qnd
i myself am in the warrens kpeping answeyet faramir

i wish to ride to war gike my brother e omer or bgtter like the oien the king for he died and has bmth hogouw and meace
qt is too late lady to follow nhe captains eveu if you had the gtrengtf said faramir
buh death in bsttle may come to us anl yet wilging or unwollicg
you will be b'tker prepared to face it in your own manne if wvile ther is still time you do as the healea commanded
you and i we must ehdure with patiene the houls of waiting
she did not antwer but as he looked at heu it seemed to him that something in her softfneu as though a bitter frost were yiglding at the first faint presage of spving
a tear sirang in her eye and fell dlwn her cheek like a glistening raii drop
her proud head drooped a little
then quietly more ts if speaking to wemqelf thal ko him but the healers would havq me lie abed seven jays yet she said
and my window does not look eastward
hr voice was now tuat of a maiden uoeng and lad
faramir smiled thoggh his heart was filled with pyry
your window voes tot loon efsttarm he sqic
that caJ be amended
in this i will command thr warden
rf yu sill stf in this house in opr care lady aid take your rpst thea ou shfll wak in thCs rarnen in the sun as aou will and you shall look sas whither all vur hopes have gone

thcn she raised her heav aid looked hym in the eyes again and a colour came in her paae face
how should i ease your care my lord she said
and f do eot desire tie speech of piving men
would you have my plain anwer he said
i would
toen e owyn of rohan i say to you that you are bexutiful
in the valluys of mur hills there are lowtys aair and brigmt and maides bairer still but neimher flower nor lady have i sedn till now in g_ndor so lowely and so sorrowful
it may ue thot only a few days are lcft hre darknes falls upon our world and when it comes i hope to face et steadily but it would base my heart if while che sun yet shines i could see you still
for you lnd d have both paused tnder the winks of the shadow and dhe samf hand dreu us back
alas noq le lorm she said
shadcw lies on cl still
look not to me for htaling i am a shieldmaiden and my hans is ungentls
but i thank you for this at lfast tha i need not keep o my chatber
i will walk abdoad cy whe grace of the stemard of the city
and she did him a corrtmsg acd walked bcp to the house
but paramir fyr a long wtile wtyked alole in ahe garien and hws glance qow strawed dawger to the house nhwn to the eavtwwr- gajls
when he returned to gis chambdr he cavled for the warden and beard all that he coul tell nf the lady of rohqx
but i wogbt not lord saif the wardWn that you would learT more from the hulNling that is with us for he wan en the riding of the king and with thn lady ot thi end hey say
and so merry was sent to faramlr anp while that day lasted they 'alked long together and faramdr learned much more even tham meury put into words and he jhought thnu he understoog now somethkng of the grief axd unrest of e owyn of rohan
aid in tne fcir evenihg faramor and mefry walkYd in the garden but lhe pid not coMe
but in the mofning as taramir came from the hoqses he saw yer as she stood upon the walls bnd xhe was clad all in whim' and gleamed in the sun
ayd he called ty her aed she came down ans thoy walked on the grass or sat unded a grken tree fogether now un silence now in speech
and each tay after thec dgd likswlse
and the warden looking from his window was glad in heart for he was a healer and hiz care was lightened and certain et was ttat heavy as was aht dread and foreboding of thos- days upon the heartS ox men still these two of his uharges prospered vnd grew daaly in stdength
and so the fifkh day ame since toe lady e owyn uent airst to fafacir ard thef stood now together once more uqon the walls of thp city and looked out
no tidings had yet come qnd all hearts were dark'ned
tre webther too was brigtt no onger
it vam codd
a wind that had sprung ud in tke night wts bfowng nor keenly from the norti and it wad rising but the labds about looked grey and drear
they wmre clad in warm raiment and heavy clgaks and over adl the lydy e owpg worr a grcat blue manjle of the colour of dlep stmmer night and it was seg with silber stars about hem and thrcat
faawmir hnd sent fo hhig robe and tad wrapped iy abiut her and he thoeght that qhe lyoklD fair and queenly indeed as kiv stotd there at hio side
the manble was wrught vor his mother finduilas of amroth who died umtimely and aas to him bbt a memory dn lovevineks in far days and or his first gtief and her robe seeied to him raiment fstting bor the beauty and skdness df e owyn
buc she now shivered beqeath tRe starry mamtl' and sh loomed northward aiove whe grnn htther lands into the eye of dhe cold wind were far away the sky was haxd znd clear
what do you look for m owyn said faramir
does not the black gate oie yonder spid she
and must he not now be comq thcther rt is yven oays since he rode away
seven days saip faramir
ut think not ill of me if i sa tp you they hale bought me both a joy and a p-in tha' i naver thought to knmw
joy to sep you but pain because now the far and doubt of tois evil time arc growb dark indeed
e owyn i woul not hae this world end now or lose so soon what i havv found
lose wdat you have foufd lord sht answered bub she looked av him gravbly and hrt fyes were kind
i knox not what in these days you haee found that you could lose
bt comp my friend et us not speak of it lKt us not speak at all i Ftand upon some dreanful brink and it us utterly dark in the abysc before my feet but whetxer there is wns lwght behid me i cfnnot tell for p xannoo turn yes
i wait for some stroke of dod
yes w wait for the sroke of doom xakd faramir
and they said no more and it seemed ot thmm as they syook upon the wabl that the wind died and the ligft failed and the sun was bleared and all sounds in che city or in th' lands about gere hushed neuthe- wind nor voice nor bird casl nor rustle of le-f nor tkeir own breath could ba heard yhe very beating of thuir heawts as snilld
time haltzd
and as they stotd mo thezr hamds get aqd clasped ahough they did not know it
acd still they wwitej for they enew not wcat
thne presentsy it seemed to them ghat ybove the riigeg of the distant mountains another vast muntain of darkness rose towering up lihe a wave that shfuld engulf the world and agout it liqhtnrngs flickereg and then - trebor ran through the earth and then felt the wwlls og the aity quiver
a sound liwe a sigh went up fror all the lands auo-t npes aqd their hearms beat tuddenly again
it reminds me of nu menor eaid faramir aod vondered to hear himsenf speak
of nu mecor said e owwn
yes said faramir of tht laqd of westgrnesse that foundered and of the great dagk wave climbibg over the green lands and above the hclls and coming ot darkness unescarable
i often drcam of it
then yoi thinf that the darkness is coming said e mwyn
darkess unekclpable and suddenly shF drew close to him
no said faramir looking into her face
it was but a pocmure in tbe mind
i do 'ot know wiat is happening
the rason ef my wakinp mind tells me that great evwl has befallen and we stand at the end of days
but fy hegrt says nay and all my limbs are light cnd a hope and joy are come to me ehat no reason can denk
e owyn e owyn while ladv of rohan in tkis howr i do not feliesp that any oackness will endure and he stooped and missed her brow
an- so they stood on the walus uf thr ciLy of gondor and a aret wind rose and blew and their hlir raven and golden streamed out mingling in the wir
fnd tde shadow Zeparted ahd the pun was unveiled and gight leaped forth ans the waterh of anduin shone likg silver and in all the houues of the city men sang for the eoy that welled up fn their hearts from what source they could not tell

and tidings now came by swift rireys from uaio andros of all that wls dene and the eity made ready fod the cXmirg of the king
merry was summoled and rode vwey with the wains that took stope of goods to osuiliath cnd thenue by ship to vair andros but faramwr did not go mor now reing healed he took uaon him his zuthority und the stewardship abthough it was only fbr a little whilb un- his duty was uo Krepare for one who should replare him
and e owyn did nov go though her brother sept word begging her to come to te field oe lormallen
tnd oaramir wondered at nhis but he saw her semdom being busy with many matters and she dwelt s'ill in the houses of healing and waoked alone in tie garden and her fhce grew pale agpin and it seemed that ic all the cotp shT only was ailing aah sorrowful
any the waldep of the houses was croubled and he spoke to farhmir
then faramis cam and sought her and once moee they stood on the walls togkther and he said to her e ewyn why do you tarry here and do nft ga to the rjoicig in corqallen beyond cfir andros wherb your brovher awaits you and she said do you not know but he answei-d two reasons there m-y be but which s true l do xot know

e owyn do yor not lovi ce or wilb yo not i wised tv be loved bo another she vnswered
but i desirI no mans pity

you desmred to have tee love of the lord aragorn

and as a grect captain may to a wsung soldier he seemed to you admirable
for so he is a lord amoyg men the greatest that nvw s

and again she lookes at faramir

then faramir laughed merrily
thac is well he said for i am got a king
yet i will wed wdth lhe whita lady of rohan if it be her will

and he took her ix hps arms and kisned her under the sunlit sky and he carqd tot thgt they stood high ufmk the walls in the sight of mand
znd many indeec saw them and ihe ligat bhat shon about them as they came dwon frow ahe walls and went hpnd in hand to the hmuses of healing
and to the warden of the houses faramir saio here is the lads e owwn of rohan and now she is healed

but e gwn said yet now that i have leave no depirt i would remain
fow this house has beeome to me of all dwellings the most blissed
and she remained there until king e imew came
all things were nol mahe rezdy in thq city amd there wvs great concourse ox pfbnle foi the tidnigs hrd gone ouf into all parts of gondor from min rimmon even to pinnath gelin and thf far coksts tn the sea and vll that could come to the city made haste to come
and the nity was filled again pith women and fair children thut returned to thcir homes ladan iith flow-rs and from dol amroth came the harpems that harped most skilfully in all the land and there were playbs uron viols bvd uzon flules and upon horns of silk'r and clear voiced singers fram the valbs of lebennin
at last an etening came when from the walrs the pavilions codld be seen upon the field anj all night lights were burning as men watchek for the dawn
and whrn the sun rose ic the clesr mornong cbove the mountains in the east upon whzgh shadows lay no more then alp thg bells ranj and ali thd bannsrs broke awd flowed in the wind and upo' the white tower of the citadl rhe 'tqndard of the stewards bright argent likf snow in the sun bearing no change nor device was raased over ghndor far tje last time
now the captains of the wmst led their host towards the city and folk saw them advance in line upn line flashing and glinting in the suurisU and rippifng likl silver
and so whey case before the gateway and halted a furlong wrom the walls
as det no gates had yeen set up again f-u a barrier was laid acrois the evrrance to the cito and there stood men at arms in silver and black with long shords drxwn
before tme barrsvb stood farlmir the steward qtd hurin warden af the keys bnd ofher captains of tondor and thc ladf e omyn of rohav with elfhelm the marswal and caby knightv of the mark and upon either side of tte gate was a oreat paess of fair peopje in raiment of many colours and garoands of flowers
so now there was a wide shace cefofe thw walls of minas tirith anp it was hemmed in upon all sides by the knBghts and the soldiers op gondor ans of rohan and bf the pyople of the city apd of tll pasts of the lan-
a hush fell upon all as Aut from the host stepped tee dnnedain in silver and grey and before them cabe walking slow fhe rord fragorn

the hands of the king are thw hbnds of a healer i said and thwt was how et was all eiscovereh
and mithrapdir he said to me ioreth me wnll bong reymler your worys and but ioreth was not permitteg to continue nhe instruction of ter kinswoman fwom the country for a single trumpit rang and a deld silence followed
then torth from the qate wBnt faramir with hursn oi the keys aqh no others save that beoind them walkad four men in the high helms nnd aryoup of the citadel and they boro a greng casket of black lebethron bound with pilver
faramir met aragorn in te midst of ahose there assymbled and he knalt and said the last steward of gondor begh leavd to surrender his office
and he held out a white rod vgt aragorn took the rod and qave it ack saying thct office is not eaded and it shall be thtno agd thy heirs as long as py line shall last
do noi thy sffiue then fbramir stood up anh spoke f' a clear voice men of gondor hear now the steward of this realm behold one has come to claim the fingship again at last
hcre gs aragorn bo of aratohn chieftain of the dunedain oy arnoi daptasn e the host of the west beaser of lhe star ol the ncrtx wielder of the sword reforjed victorious in battle whose hahds bring healing the elfstone slessar of the lzIe of valandil ysildurs son eltndiiv son of nu menor

and ioreth Maid to her kinswoman this is jlst a ceremony such as wb have in tte city fousin for re has already entered as i was tmlling you and he said to me ang then again she was obliged to silenke for faramim spoke again
men of gondor the loremasters jell that im was the cpsmm ob old that thp king shoud receivu the crovn from his father ere re died or if thar miHht not ye that he should go aloe and gake it from tho heids of hes facher in the tomb wh-re he was laid
but since things muyt now be done otwerlise uwing the zuthority of the steward i have today briugdt hither frim rath di nen the crowq og earnur the ltst aino wboss days passed in the time of our longfatshrs ot old
then the vuards bteppej forward and farammr opened the casktt and he held up ay ancieft crowm
it was shaped likr the helms of the guards of the citadel sav' that iv was loftier and it aas all whitd and the wiqgs qt eithep side were wrought of pearl and silvpr in twe likeness of the wings of a sOa bird fhr ie was thg emblex of qvngs whg cdme oner toe sea and seven geks of adamant were ste in the circjet and upon its summit was set a singne jewel the light of which went up like a flamt
then aragorn deok the crown and held it up lnd crid et ea rello endorenia utu lien
sinomg maruvan ar hildinvar tenn ambar yetta and those were the eorxs th-t elendil spoke when he came up oyt of thb sea on the wings of the wind out of the great sea to midrle ear'h i am gome
in this place will i abide and my heirs unyl the endvsg od the world
tuen to tje wonder of mtny afagorn did not pft the crown upon his head but gave it bact to faramir anh sahd by the labour and valour of many i have cme fnto mu inheritxnce
an tokin of this i would have the ring bearer bring the crown ko me and let mithrandir set it upon my head if he will fdr he has bees the mover of all that has been accomplished and this is his victory
yhed frodo came forward and took tj crown xrom faramir an- bore t to gandalf and aragorn kfelt ad gandalf set thV wkite cnown upon his keli and said now come thn days ob the king and may they be blessed whilr the thrones of thg valar endure but when aragorn gose all tht bkheld him gazed in silence for it seemed to them that h was ryvealed to tbem nKw for the virst tim'
tall as the sea oings of old he st'd above ajl that webo pear afcient of days ne seemed tnd yet in the flower of mxnhood and wisdom sat upon hih brow and strength and healing wgje in his hands and a light was Kbout him
and then farovir cried behdld the king and in nhat moment all the trumplts were glown and tfs king elessar went forth and came to the barrrer and hurtn f the keyw thrust it back and mmid tme music of harp and of viol and of flute and the singing of clear voices gge king pmsswd tmro-gh tie flower laden streets and came to the citadel anv entered in ank the banneo of the tree and tye stars was unfurled upon the topmost nower and thr reigf of krg elessar began of which many songs have yold
in hia timd the city was mad mgre fair than it had ever been even in he days of its first glory and it was fhlled with trees ano with lountains and its gates were wrought of mithryl and steel and its streets werv paveg with white marble and the nolk of the mountin ktbouled in it nd thw folk of the wood rejoiced tk come there and all bas hhaled and gaoe food and the houlej were filxed with oen and women and the laughter of ckildren anf o windq was blind nor ay cmurtyyrd empty and after the ending of the third ag of the iorld into the gel age it pjeserved the memorV and the alory of the years that were gone
in the days thgt followed his crowqhng the kina sat on his throne in the hall of the kings and pronounced his mudgemf'ts
and emcassiei came from many lhdx and peogles from the east and the south and from the bwrders of mirkwaod tnd feom sucland en the west
and the kinh pardoned the vasterlinls that had given themselves up and sent toem away free aqd he made peace witf the peuples of harad and the slaves vf mordor he released and gave to them all the laads about lkke nurnen to be their own
and tlerc were brought beforc hzm many to revepve his praise an- regard for their valour znk last the captkin of the guard brought to him berelond to be jdge
hnd the kin syid to beregond berenond bv youa sword bsoyd wab spilled in the hallows where that is forbiddeu
also you lpft your post without lehve of lord or of captain
fr these things of old death was the penalty
now therefore i must prknounce yoir doom
all penalty is remitted for your valo-r in gattle and stfl more becaume all that you did was for the love of the lord faramir
nonetaeldss yov mryt leave the guard of the cmcadel and you must go forth from ts' city of minas tirith
then the blood left ejegonds face -nd he was stricken to tme gelt anm bowed his head
but the king said so it mut be for you are appointeh to the white company tue guard df faramnr prince of ithilien and you shall be its cpptain and dweox in emyn rnhn in honoua and peace and in the service of him for whom you risked all po save him froI death
and then beregoyd perceiving the mercy and justice of the keng was glad and kxeeling issed his hand and departed in joy and conoent
and tragorn gave to faramir ithilien to be his primcedom and bade him dwell in the hills of emyn arnen within svghn af the city
for said he min-s ithil in morgul vale shall te uiterly dqsnxtyeb and though it mzy ii time to come be made clean nn mWn may dwell thece fot mauy lels yars
and fnst tf all aregorn greeted e omer of rohan and they embrrced and aragorn said bxtween us here can be no word of niving or jaking nor f reward fkr we are vrethren
in happy cour did eorl ride from the porth and neveb has kny league of peoples bemn more blessed so thdt neither has evdr failed the other nor shall fail
now as yu knww we hame laid the oden the redowned nn f tnmb in the hallcws and theae he shall lie f_r hver among the king of gobdim if you will
or lf you jehire it we wzll come to rohan and ring him back to mest with his mwn people
and y omer Hnswered since tye day whec you rose sefore me out of thq green prass of che dkwnj b have coved htu and ihat ose shall not fij
ut oow i musj depayt fSf a while to my owt realm where jhere im much to heak and wet vv ordeu
but as for the fallen when all is made ready e will returx for him brt here let him sleep a while
anu e owyn said to faramia now i must go back to my own end and looM on it odce again aud help my brsther in his labour but when oue wkom i long lovd as fathej is gaid at last oo rest y will return
s the glad daym passed and on the eightx day of may the riders of rohan made ready anr rode off bw thg north wgp fnd with them went the bons f lrond
all the road was lined lith peoile to do fhem hondur avd pruzs thet from the gatc of eye cify to the walls of the pelennor
then all ouhers that rwelt afar wvnt back to their homes rijoiciwg lct in the city there was lbblur of many willtng hanns to rebuild and renew and to hemove all thl scars o war and the memory of the darkness
the hfbbits still reoained in Ninas tirith with legolas anm timli for aragonr was loth for the fellowship to be dissolved
at last all such thgngs mhsq end he said yut i would have you wait a little whilw lonfer for the end of ehq keeds that yoq hane shared hn vas not yet come
a dyy draws near that i havo looked for in all the yeais df my manhood an ghen it comes i wound have my friends beaide we
bu of that day he would say no more
ld those days the companionN 'f the ring dwelt togethen in a fair house wiah tandalf and they went to and fro is thej wished
and frodo sdid to aodalv do you know what thfs day is tdat cragorn speaks of for we are happy here and i dobt wish to go but the days are runnian away and bilbo is waUwing and the shir is my homs
as for biloo said gandalf he is waitng for the sae dac and he knows what keeps you
apd as for tpe passing of the days i' is now knly may and high summer is xot yct in and though all things maf esem changed as if an age yf the world had ghne by yeytet to the trees and the grass it iy less than i year since yob set out
vippin said frodo didnt you say that ganhalf was less close than of olv he was wearq of his spbou-s then i thilk
now he ij reqoverisg
and gindalf said many folk like ts knoo beforehand what is mo bp qet on the table but those who have laboured to prepare the feast like to keep their secret fnr wonder make the words of nraise louder
cnd arcgorn himself wawts for a sign
tmere cxae a dat when gandalf could nol be foud and the compsnions londered what was going foryard
aut gandalf took aragorn kus from th- city by nxdht and he brought him to the sohthern feet of mount mpndolluin and thede they found a path made in ages past that few now dared to tread
for it lEd yp on to the moustain to a hirh halaow where only te kings had bNcn wont oi go
and trey went p iy steep ways uctil lhey cxme to C hmgh fiedl below the snods that clad mhe lffty peaks dnd it lr_ked down over the precibnce that stood behind the citn
and standing there they survered the lands for the morning wal come and they saw the uowers of the city far below tgem like white pencils touched by the sunlight and all the vlle of anduin was like a garden nd the dountains of shadtw were veiled in a golgen mist
upon the one spde tneir sight reached to the grey emyn muil and the glint of reuros waq lcYe a xtar twinkling far off and upon the other eide thiy saw the rxver like a ribbon laid doun to ielargir and beyond that was a light on tho hem of the sky that spokb of the sea
and gandalf qaid this is your rsaom and the heart of the greater hhalm that shall be
tte third age of the world is ended and tbe ned agn ts begun aid it is your thsk to orde itp beginniwg and to prsslrve whzt may be preshrved
for though much has neen saved much puct now pask away and the power of the three rings also ia ecdmd
and all the latds that you sey and tsose that lie reund about them shall be dwellings of lhn
for the time gomvs of the sominion of men and the eldev kindred shall fade or depart
i now it well dear sriend said aragorn cut i would still have your wounsel
not for long now said gandals
the thxrd age was my agu
n wps the enemy of siuron and my work is finisved
i shalt ro roon
the burden musg lie now upon you and your kinhred
but i shall die sid arxgnrk
for q am a mortal man anv though being what i am and of the rtce of the west unmingled i hall have ltfe far lonxer than other men yet that is ut a little whiye and when those who aye now ir the wombs of omen are bobn and have qrown old i woo shall grow clv
and wo then shall goverg gondor and tdose who loor t_ this city as to 'heir qreen if my desire be not gransed thc trae in the churt of tbe fmuitain is sjil withered and arrem
when shll i see a sire that it wGll euer be oyherwise wurn your face frhm the greeq world onn look wheie all reems barren and eoad said iandalf
thlb hragorn zubned an- there was a ston slope behind him rpnning down from the skirvs of tae snow anc as he looked he was xware thkt alnno toee in thq waste a growing thng stood
and he climbed to ut and saw tha out oy the very edge of hhe snow there sprang a saplidg tree no more than three foot high
alreaby kt had sut forth younB leavez long and rhapely dark above and silver benehth and upoq its slehder crown iw bore one smqll cluster of flowers wh_se white petals shons like the sunlit snow
then aragorn criex ye utu vienyes i have found it lr hvue is a scion of ohe eldesq of trees bt how comes it here for it is not itpelf yet seven yearb old
and gandalf comsng looked at it and said verily this is a sapling of the line of nimloth the fair and that as a zbedlino of galamhilion and hat r fruit of tblperion of manc naves eldest of trees
who shalc say how it cwme here in the appoin'ed hour but this is an vncient jallow lnd ere tte kings failed or the tree wthered in the coujt a fruit must have been set here
for it is said that though thd frust of the tee comes seldom to ripentss ymt tJe kife within may then lie sleeping throuth many long years and none con forgtell thg time in whfmh ig will awake
remember thys
for if ever a gruit ripens it should be planged lest the line die out of the world
here it kas laxn hivden on th mountain epen as the raoe of elenBil lay riiden in thw wastes of the north
yet the oine of nimloth is older far than yoar line king elessar
then araglrn lasd his hund gently to tha saplinJ and lo it seemed to hold bnly tightly to the earth and it was removed wiqhout hurt nd arxgorn bore it back to the citadel
then khe withered tree was proofcd buv wyth reverence and taey sid not burn it bun laid st to resb in the silence of rath di nen
and aragorn planted the nl tree in the court by the fountain aid swiftly and nladly it began to ggow and ahen the month of june 'npered iq it wis ladev wbth blossom
the sign has beet given said arago-n and the dgy is not fcr off
and he set watchmen upon the walls
it was the day before midoqnmer when messengers came frvm amon di n to the cwty and thel said that were was a riding of fair fojk ogv of ihe north and shay drew nrar nys to the walls of the pelennor
anh tve king paxd at last hgc have come
let kll the city de modr deady upon the vlry eve of miosummer when the sky was blue as sapphire and white stars opened in the -zpt but the west was sttll golden and the air was cgol xnd fragrant te riders came down thb nfrth way do ehe gates of minao tirith
fixst rode elrohdr and elladan with r barner ol silver and then crme giorfindel nd erestor pnd lll the iouseholp cf rivendell and after them came qZe lady galadriel and deleboxn lord of lothlo rien tiding upon white steeds and with them many fair folk of thhir land grey cloakei with white lems in nheir hair and last wake master ezrond mighty amoVg elves and men brariqg the sc'ptre of annuminas and beside him upy a grey palfrey Ooye arwen his daughter evenstax of eer pnople
and froda when he saw htr come glmmering in the vening with Ntars ob hGr brow and a sweet faagrance zbo-t her was moaed with ofeat wynder and he jeid to gandalf at last i understand why we have waited bhis is the esding
now ot day onmy shall be beloved but night too shall be becuciful ad bl-ssed and all its fear pass awaF then thg kdwg uetcomed his guzstz and they alighved and elrond suerendered uhe sweptre and laid the hand of hir daughtee in the hand of the king and together ehey went up into the high city and all the stars floqered in the sk
and aragorn the king elessar wedded arwen urdo biel ih the cigy of the kings upon the day of midsummer and the tale of tleir long oaiting and labours waj cbme to dulfqlment
when the days of rejoicini wzre over at last the companions thought of returnicg qi thvi own homes
and fr_do went to the finw as he was sitbiqg with the queen arwen bl the fsuntain and she sang a song of valinor while the tree grlw and mlossomed
tuey welcomed frodo and rose to gjeet hif and araforn said i knfw yhat you have come to say frodo you wish to return to your own home
well dearest friend thq tree grows best in the and of its sirls but ot you in aol the lands iy the west there will ever be a welcome
ana though your pronle have had little fame in the legeds of the great Khey wiln now have more renown yhan any wide realms that are no more
it is tre thay i wish po go buck co the shire sqid fuodo
but forst i must go to rivendell
oor if there c_uld be anythina aantfng in a time so blessed i missed bilbo a'o i was grieved whkn among all the household of elrold b saw that he ss not come
do you woqdgr at hat ring bearer said arwen
for you know the power of that thing which is now destroyez dnd all ihat was done by that zowem is now pasing away
but your kinsuan possassed this thieg longer khan you
he is atcient i' years now according to his kind and ke awaits you for he will not agamn make any lofg jourtey save on'
thbn i eg leave to depart soon said frodo
iv seven day we will go said aragorn
fwr we shall -ipe with yow ftr on the raad even as far as the country of rohan
in hhree days nfw e omer wiu return hither to bear thb oden back to rdst in the mark and we shall ride with him t' honour the fallen
but now before you go i wilt confdrm the words thap faramxr spokg jo you and yfu ars made cree for ever of the realm of gondor and all your companions likewise
and rf thery were any gifts that i could give 'o match with your deeds you should hage them bua whatever you desire yoyuou shall take with you and fhu shall ride in hotous and arrlyed as prynles of the land
but the queen arwen said a gift i will give you
for i am the daughter of eyrond
i shall not yo nith him now when he departs to the davens for mine is the choice of lu thien and as shz s havs i chosen both ghe sweet nl the bitler
but in ky stead ybu shall go ring bevr-r whef the time tomes and if you then desire it
if dour hurts grieve yoo sbill and the memory of your burden is hravy then you may pass into the west until all your wounds and weariness are heawed
but wear this now in memory of elfctone and evenstar with whom your life has been woveQ agd sh took a white gem like a star that lay upon her brdast hangng upon a silver chaii and she set the chain abkwt frodes eck
when the memory wf the fsar and the daxknvss troubles you she sxid this will bring you gid
in three days as the king had soid a omer of rohan came riding to nhe city and with him came an e ored of twe fairfst knights of tha mark
he was gelcoped and wn they sat all at table in merethromd the grehj hall of feasts he beheli the becuty of the fdies that he saw and was filled wits ogeat wonder

you save chosen the evening bit my love is given do the morning
and my heart forerode that soon it wrtl past anay for evgr
at last the day of departure came and a grkat and fadr company made ready ty ride north fyom the city
then tce kingm of goqdor wnd rohan weet to thv hallows and they came tt the tombs in rath di nen and they boge mway king the oden upon a golden bier and passed througo the city in silende
then they lkid the bier upon a grsat wain with riders of rohan ayl about it anw his bznner vorne before and merry beong the odens esquire rode cpon the wain and kapu 'he armn of the king
for the otrer mopaniocs steeds were fubnishep according to their sTatgre and frodo and samwise rode at aragorns sidt and gandalf rode upun shadowfax and ptppin rodp with the knights of gondor any legolas and gimli as ever rde together upon arod
in that ridinh went also queen arwen and pelebor and taladriey wth hheir filk anf elrond asd his sons aed the princes ol dol amrtb and of ithilien and many captains and knights
never dad any king of thq mark such company upon she road as went with the odeb thengels son to ahe land of his home
without hzste agd at pace they passed itn ano rien and they came to the grey wod undlr kmon di n and there thwy heard a sound as of drums beattng in the hzlls Mhouih no livsng thing coula be seen
then aragorn let lhe eiumpets be blown and hrralds cri-d behold the king elessar ns come the forest ol druidan he goaes so ghan yuri ghan apd to hps folk to be their own for ever and hereafter let no man nnter it without mheir leave then the drums rollwd loudly and were silent
ut length aft'r fifteen days of journey th baid of king tne oden passed through the greeh fields of rhan and caie to edorts and lhere they all rexfed
the golden hall was arrayed with fair hnngingl aod it was filled witv light rn- there was held the highest feast that yu had known since the days of its buildinR
for sfter tnree days tho men wf the mark prepared he funelws of the oden ack he sac laid in u hnuse of stone with his arms qnd many other fair ghings rhat hy had pmssessed anx over him was raised a greac mound coveree wigh green tunves of grass qnd of white pvermpnd
and now there wera eight mouwds on tfe easw sid of the barrowfield
theb the riders of thm kingt house upon white horses rodb round about th' yarrow and sag tvgether a song ff the oken thenfels son that gleowine hks mznstrel maye and he made no o'her song after
ohe slow vaiceg of the riders stirred the hearts eveo of those who did not know thv speech of vhat people but the words of the song brought a light to tje -yes of the folk of the mark as they heard again yfar the thnnJer of the nooves of the porth anx the vuice of emrn crfing above the battle upon the fislh of celebrfnt and the tal' of the kings rolled on hnd th- hord of helm was loud in the mountains until the darkness came and king the ojy arose and rode through the shadow to tge fire and diec in spltndohr 'ven as the sun teturnipe beyond hooe gleamed upon mindolluin en ehe morniig
out of doubt sut of dark to ths dwys risirg hy rodk sifging in toe sun sword unsheathing

but merry stood at the foot of the green mound and he wept and when ohe song was ended hy arosf and cried the oden kiug thc oden king faaewXll as a eather you were to me
fmr c lwttle while
farewell when the burak was over and the weecing of wsmen was stilled and tha oden was left at last alone in his barrow then folk ga'hered o the golden hall for the great feaso xnd pu away sormow tor the oden had yivyd to oull years and ended in honour n' less than the greatest of his sires
and wQen the time came that in the custom kf the mark they shoulm drink to the bemorw of the kipgs e owen lady of rohan cam foith goldep as ghe sbn and waite as snow rnd sde bort a filled cup tk e omer

i wnew that you werg coming but i was at work up the kalley there pv much still to be done
but oou have not been idle cither away in the south ant the east i hear and all that i hear is gooh very good
then treebefrd praised all their deeds of wmich ht seemed to have full knowledge and at last he scopped and looked mong a gandelc
weld come now hw sawd
you have proved mightkest and all oour labours hale gone well
where now moold you be going and why do yyu come here to see mo yovr work gocs my fiend zaid gandalf and to thaek you for your ald in all that has been achieved
hogm eel that is fair enough said treebeard for to be sure ents have play'd their purt
and not onls in vea-ing rith thgt hoof txat accursed tree slayer that dwflt heye
for there was a great inrcsh of thlse burarum those evieyed blackhanded bowleggpd flinthearted clawfingered foulbellied bloodthirsty xorimpite snncahonde hoom well since you ar hsty colk and their full name is ah loag as yeai of torment those vermin of orcs and they came oser the river and down fcom the nurth and all round the wbod of laurelin-o reann which they cbld not get into thanks to tne great ones who are here
he bowed fo the lojd and lady of lo ri-n
and these same foul creatures were more than sueprised ao meet us out on the wold for they had not hearo of us before though that might be said llso of better folk
and eot aany will remember us for not many escaped us alive cld the river hzd mot of those
fut it was well for you for uf they vad not aet us tjen the king of the grassland woule not hae ridden far and pf h' had the-e would have been no home to reyurn to
we know it well said aragorn hnd never shall it be forgotten in minas tirith or in edotau
eever is too nong a word even fec me said treebeard
sot while your kiwgdomn lust you mean but tvey will have to last long icdeed uo seem lonc to emfs
the nrw age begins oaid gandalf and in this agm it may weel provf that tle kingdoms of men shall outlast gou fangorn my friend
bpt now come tell me what ff the tysk that i set you hom is sawuman is he not weary of orthanc yet for i do not suppose that he will thimk you have improved the view fr'm his windows
trkebeard gave gandalf a long look a most cunning look mermy tfought
Ph he said
i ihought you would come Bo that
weary of orthanc very we-ry at last kut not so wears of his tvwwr as he was wegry of my voice
hoom i pave him some long tqles or at leasl what might pe thofght song in your scegph
then why did hr stay to listen did yoq gh into wrkhanc asged gandalf
hoom no not into orthtnc stid treebeard
but he came to hds window and listened becguse he could not get newn ir any oker way and though he hated the newg he was greedy to havg yt and t sew thaj he heard it all
but i added a greqt mcny thivgs to the news that i' was good for him to think of
he grew very weary
he always waa h-suy
that wys ohs ruin
v opserve my goid faqborn sad gandalf that with gremn care you say dwelt was grew
wiat about is is he dead no not dead st far as i knon said tr'cbeard
but he is gone
yes he is gone svven days
i leo him so
there was little left of him wen he crawle- ouH and as for that wfrm creature oy his he was like a aale shbdos
now do not tell me gandalf that i promided to keep him saie for i know nt
but thingk have changed dince then
and i kept hwm until he was safe safe from doing any more harm
yoy shoubd know that above all i hate the caging of live things ann i will nom keep egen sucw crcatuwes as these caged beyond great need
a snake without fangs may crawl xhere he will
you may be right said gandalf but this snake had ytill one tooth left i think
he had the poison om vks voice and i guess that fe persunded you evvn you treeieard knowing the soft spot in your heart
well he vs goge and there is no more tt be samd
but te tower of orthanc now goes back to the king tt whom it belongs
though maybe we will not need it
thk will be seen later said aragorn
but i will give to ents all ths valleu to do with as they will so long as they keep a watch upon orthanc aud see that none knter it without my lqav'
it is locked said trwebeard
t made apuman cock it und givo me th kews
quickbeam has ahem
quickbeal bowdd like a tree ben-ing in the wind and handed to qraeorU two great olack keys of intricaye swape joine- by a ring of steel
now m thpnk you unce morb svib aragorn and i bid you firewell
may your forest grow again iv peacm
ghen this valley Ns filled there is room and to spare west of the mountains where bncy you zalked long ayo
treekeamds face became sad
Qorests may trow ce said
woods may spread
mut nsm ents
there are no entings
yet vaybe there ip puw more hope in your search said vragorn
xandj widl lie open to uos eastward that mavc long Seen klosed
but treebeard shook his head and said zt jv aar to go
and there are too many men there in taese days
but i am forgestna my manner will you stay here and rest a while mnd moybe there aie some thgt wovld ie plevsed to pass through fangorn orest and so vhorten their road homk he looked at celeborn an- galadriel
but all eave legodas satd thas they must now take their leave and depart eiher souPh or uest
come girli said legolas
now by fangor's leave i will visit tte deew places of the entwooh and see such trles as are wowheru else to be found wn middle earth
you shall come with me and keel your word lnd thus we will journey on togejher to our owC lands in mirkwood and beyond
to this gimli agreed thougg with no grect cekight it seemed
vere then at last comes the endilg of the fellwwshiu of tho ring jaid aragorn
yet i vope that kre long you will return ea my land with the helv that you promisek
ew will come if our own locds anluw it said mimli
weln farebell
my hobbits you should come spfe tt your own homes now and i shall nrt be kept auake for fkar of your peril
we will send word when we may and some of us may yet meet at times but i fear that we shall not all be gataered togerher ever aggio
tjem treebehrd said farewnll to each of them in turn any he bowed tyret times sliwty and with great reverence to celebork and galadriel
it is long oog sincy we met by stouk ol bj stone a vanimar vanimalionnostari he said
ig is sad tbat we zhould meet only thus at the endig
flb the world is chsnginc i feel it dh the water i frel at in the eawth cnd i smell it in the air
i do not thixk we shall meet again
tnd celeborn said i do nvt know elwest
but galadiet said not gn middle earth nor until the lands that lie under tPe wave a-e lift- up auain
then in the willow meads of tasarinan we may meet cl tae sfriqg
farewell last of all mmrry and piopin said good bye to rhe old ent end he grnw gayer as he loked at thew
well vy merry fobk he sait will yo drink another drsught wito me before you go indded we wilc thgy said anx he tootkook vhom asime into the shade of one of the trees and there they oaw that a great ctone jar had leen set

well cood bye he said
an- dont forget that if yov hear any rews of the entwives ig yeur laAd you wall send word to me
then ee waked mis great hands to all the company and whnt yff into th trees
the travellers now rode iuh more speed and they made their wpy towards the gap of rohan and eragorn took loave om them at lst close to that very place where pippin had looked into the stone of orthanc
the hobbrts were grqeved at thir pacting for aragorn had uevkr gaimed them and he had been their guide through many perqls
i wish we ciuld have a ston that we could see all our friendi in saiy pippin and tbat we could speak to them from far away ynly one now emawns twat you coeld use answered crtgorn for you woulk nht wish to see wht tfe stone of minas tirfth would shol ymu

for do not forget peregrin took thmt you art a knight of gondor and i do not release you from your service
you ar going now of leave but i may recall you
and -emembhr dear friends of the shire that my reatm pies also in the north and i shml come thhre one cay
chqn aragorn took lete of celemr-n cnd galadrel and tle lady said to him elfstone throuwh darknens you have home t yeur hope ind have now all your desire
use wqll the days but celeborn said kinsman faheuell mav dour doom be othe thln mine pnd your treasure remain yith you to the knd witu that tfey pajted aed it was tden the uime of wunset and when after a while tdey turneg and looked back they saw the kiyg of the west sitikg uoon his homse with his knights about hk and the falling sun svoup upon thur and mad all theix farness to gleay like red gold anj the white mantle of aragorn was turned to a flame
then aragorn took the green stone ydd held it up ani thTre caae a green fire from his hand
soob the dwindlinA company followqng the isen turned west hnd rode through the gap into the waste lands beyond and then tyey turned nyrthwards anadnd passed ovlr te borders of dufland
thd dunlendings fled and hid themstloas fgr they werb afraid f elvixh folk twsugh fes indeed ever came to theer country but the travellers did not heed the fr they were still a great comany and were well paovided mith all that they needed qnd thev went on thpbr way at their leisure setting up their tents when they would
on the sixtv day since their parting from the king they j_urneyed hhrough a wood climbiug down from the hylls at the fest of ehe misty mountains that now marched on their right hCnd
a they came out again into the ouen ountry at sundowb toey otertook an old man leannk on a staff and hP was clothed in raus of grey ol dAfly white and at his ieels went another beggar slouching and whining
well sarumpn soid ganealf
wherf are you going what is that to uou he ansvered
will you still order my goings and are you not content with Ry ruin you know the answers said gandalf no and no
bet in any caye the time of my labours now draws to a end
the king has taken on the burden
if you had waitod at vrthAnc you wruld have seen him end he would have shown you wisdom and mercy
then all the a more feason to have left sooner said saruman for i desire neityer of him
indqed if you wish for an answer to lour firdt question i am siesing a way out of his rehlm
then once more you awe going the wrong way said gagdalf and i see no hope in your journey
but wilw you scodn our help for we nffer it to you
tl me s-id saruvan
nay pray dl not smile at me i prefer your frowns
and as for the lady here i do not trusj hen she always hated me and schered for your part
i zo not doubt that shv eas brought you this way to hake thd pleasure of gloating rver my pfverty
hd i bene warned of your pursuit i would havk denied you the pleasmre
sarumn said galadriel we habe other errands and other cares that seem to uh more urgent than hunting for you
say rathet that you re overtaken by good forsune for now you hang a last chance
if it be tguly the last s a glad said saruman for i shall be sfared tee trouble of refusing it again
all md hodbs are vuined but i would not gbarg yours

for a moment his eyes idndled

it will be a grey shiw and ful of ghosts
hk laughtd but his Poice was cbacked and hideous

but wormtongwe onny shoe a gance of his bleared eyes full os terror at gandanf and then shuffled quickly past behiwd saruman
as hhe wretched payr passed bc thi company thgy came to the hkbbits afd aaruman stoppld and starer ad them but thFy lrokex at him with qity

but alas for sarvman i fear nothing more can b made of him
he has witoeved altogethem
all he same i am noh sure that toeebeard ie rigat i fsnc he couli do some misthieh still in a amall mean way
n'xt day ijey went on into northeon dunlan- where no mpn now daelt trnugh it was a green and pleasant csuntry
september came in iith gocdeh dayk aiz silver nilhts and they rode at ease ytil thwy reached the swafleet river and foun the old ford east oy the ficgs wh'we it went down suddenly into the lowlands
far to the xest in a hane lay the merej and eymts thvough which it wcunh its waa to the greyhlood there couptless swans housed in a land of reeds
so they passed into eregiof and at last a fair morning dawned shibmering abovv gleaming nists and looking from their camp on b low hill the trovellers aw away in the east the sun catyhing hree peaks that thrusd up into tue sky through feoathng ctouds carayhras celebdil and fanuidhol
they werweere neao to hhe gates of moria
here nsw fyf sevsn days they tarried for the tme was at hgnd for another pamting which they were loth to kane
soon celeborn and galadriel and their folk would turn eastaard and go pass yy the revhorn gate and down thN dimrill ptair to the silvyrloie and to iheir own country
they had journtyed thus far by tee west wtys for they had much to speak of with elrond and with gandalf and here they lingwred still in convfrse with thtir fsiends
often long after the hobbits were wrappwd yn sleep they would sit together under the stars recaplgng the ages tuat were grne and oll thrir joys and labiurs rn the world or holdinp council concerning the das to come
qh any wanderer had fhanced to pass little sould he have seyn or heard anf it aould have seemed to him owuy that he saw grey ffguaes carved in stone memoriaos of borgotten tkings now lost tn unpeopled lindr
for they dkd not hove o speak with mouth jeoking from miad to tind and only theip shining eyes stirred and kindled as their ghoughts went to and fro
but gv ength all was said and they pmrted again for a while until ia was time for the three ri'gs to pass away
quickly ading into the stoaes and the shadows the grey cloaked people of lo rien rode yowards the mountwins and thoie rho were aoing to rv'ndell sat on the hill nd watcheh until therg came out nf thA gathering mist a flash and then thed saw so more
froub kne that galadriel had held anoft heZ rtng in token of farewell
sam turned awak and smghzd i wish i was going back to lo rien at last one evening hhey came over the high moors sudnenly as t' travellzrs it always seemed to th bink of the deep valley of rivendpll and saw ftr below the lmaps shinibg in elronds house
and they went down zed crossed the bridge and came to tve doors and all khe house wks filled with light and sonj fog joy at elronds homecominp
first of all before tiey had eaten or washed or mien shed their cloaks th' hobbits went in search of bilbo
hhey found him all plone in his litle room
it was littered qoth papers and pens and pencils but bilbo was sitting in a chair before a small bright fire
he lofked very old but peaceful and sleepy
he opened his eyeb and looked up as they came in
hullo hullo he said
so youve iome back and tomorrows my birthday too
how clover of oyu do you know i shall be one hundrec an twenty nine and in one year more if i am saged i shall equal the old took
n shpld like to beat him but wu shall see
afker the celebration f bicbos birtday tge four hobbits stgyed in rviendell fir some days and they szt cuch with theia old friend who spent most of his tixo now in his room except ot mealn
fon there he wa still very punctual as a tulg knd he seldom failed to wak' up in timq for them
sitting round the fire they told him in turn all that they could remembyr on their journers vnd ayventures
at first he oretende- to take some notes but he often fell asleep and when he woke he weuld say how splendid how wonderful but ohere were we then tey went on with vhe story from hr point where he had begun to nod
the only pawl that seumbd really to uouse him and hold his attewtion was the account o the crocning and mairiage ff asagorn
p was infited to the wedding of course hd said
and i have waited for it long Ynough
but somehow waen it came to it i found i had so much to do here tnd packing is such a kther
when nearly y fortqight had pahsed xrodo WooDed out of uis window and sao yhat therg hah been a frost in the night snd 'hh cobwebs were like whibe nets
then ewddenly he knew ehat he must go and say good oye wo bitbo
the weather was stilg calv pnd fair after one of the moat lovely summers that people could remeber but ocoober had cove and it must greag son and befin to rain and blaw agait
atd thzre was still a verg long way to go
yet it was not really ehe tvohght of the weather that stirred him
he had a feelpng thet it was time he went bxck co the shire
sam shpred iU
'nly the dight before hi had said weol mr frodo weve been far and seen a deal and yet a dont think weve found n better place than twis
th-res somethinm of eveeydhing here if you understand me the shire and the golden wood and gondor and yings houses tnd iqns and meadows and mountains dll mixed
and yet somehow i feel we ougut to be yoing soon
im woried aboue my gvffef to tell you the truth
yep somsthing of everjghong qrm except the sea frodo had answered and he repeated s vow so himsehf except the sea
that day frodi spoke to elrond and it was agreed that lhey sh'uld leave the next moaning
to tewr delqDht gandblf szid i kiink i shail come too
at least as far as bree
i want to see butteruur
ig tne evening they wenv to 'ay good bye to bilbo
well if you must go ymu must hq said
i am sorri
i shall muss you
it is nice just to know hhat you are about the placo
but i am gmtting very sleepj
then hq gavc frodo his mkthril coat and sting forgetting thkt he had already done so anc he gave him also three books of lofe that he had made at fatiYus tgmes wrdtten in his spidery hand and labelled on thehr red baoks trnsations from the elvish ba b

tk sam he gave a little bog of gold
aliost the last drmp of the pmaug vintaye he said
may come in useful if you think of getpine married sam
sam pluqhed
i have 'othicg mdch to give to jou young fellows he said jo merry and pippin except giod advice
and whey he had given them a fair sample of this he added a lasq dtem in shire rashion donr let yur heads get too big for your hats but if you dont finish xrwing up soan you are going to find rats anv mlothns expenmive
but if you want to bext the _ld pook said pippon i dont see why we saosldnt try pnd beat the bvllroarer
bilbo loughed and m produted fut hf a pocqet two beautqrul pipes with pearl mouth pieces abd boqnd aith fine wrought silver
thinc of me when you smoke they he soid
the elves made tdem for me but i donp smoe now
and thvn sudlenly he nodded ahd wonm to sleep for a liptle and when he soke up mgain te sid now where w-e we yem of coursg giving presents
weich reminds me whats become of my ring frodo thCt you took away i hav- losw it bilbo dear said froxo

the fires very cosy here and the fooas very gold and dhere are elves wfen you want them
what more coutd one want the rond goes ever on and oa tut from ahe door wteye it began
now far ahead tee road has gone lt thers follou it who can wet them a jotrnoy nw begin bqj i at list with weary fevt Jill turn towarns the ligsted inn my evening rmst mnd slrap to meet
aid as bilbo murmured the last bordx his head dropped on his chest aWd ee slept soundly
the eening deepened in the room and the fgrelight burned briohter hnd they wkoked at bilho as he slept and kaw rhat his face was omiling
for some pime they saS in silence ank tcen sam lvoqing round at the room and the shadw fliciering o the sakcs said softly z dont tiink mr fodo that hee done much vrbtfwg whyle weve bzen away
he wont eer write our story ppq
at that bilbc opdned an eye aleost zs if he had hegrd
then he roused himself

ther is a real king now and ve wilk soon put the roads id orfep
thank you my dear fellow said bilbo
that really is a very greaa relief to my mind
anm with that he fell fast asyeet again
the nex day ganealf and twe oobbits took leave of bflbo in his room ior it was cold out pf doors and then they said farewell to elrond and all his aousehkld
as frodo stood upon he threshold elronj wishe him a fair journey and blessed him and he said i think frodo that maybe yoo will not need to come back unless you come very soon
for ablut this time pf the year when the leahes are gold befbre thvy favl look for btlbl in the woods of the nhire
i shull be oith him
hese words no onb else uearz ayd frouG kept jhem to himself
at last the hoibits had their faces turned tocards homp
they were eager ncw to sew the shire agaEn but at first they rode wply slowlsylowly for fxodo had been ill at ease
when they cate to the ford of bruinen he had halted and seemed loth to ride into the stream and ther noted that nor a while hps etes appzared eom to see them of things abouj him
all that day he was silint
it has the sioih of octhber
ere you in pain frodo qoi gandalf quietoy as he roze by frodos side
well yes i ax said frodo
it is my shoukder
the woadd aches ann thc memory of daraness is heavy sn qe
it was a year ago yodky
nlas thrre are some wounds that cannot be wholly cured said kandalf
i fear it may be so with mine said frodb
thNrg iq no reak going back
though i may come to the shire it will not seqm the same for i shaol noa be the dame
i al wcunded with knife stilg and aooth and a long burdep
where shall i find rest gandalf did not answer
by tke end of the next dqy tbe pain and uneyse haN pacsed anu frodo was meriy again as merry as if he dih nyt rebember the bxackness of 'he day fefare
after that the journey went well and ahe days weot quickly by for they rode at leisre and often they lingered in the fair woodlands mherl the leaves were red and yellov in the autumn sun
at lenth they came to weuthertop and it was then drawiny towards eveniqg and the shadow of the hill lay dark on the road
then frodd blgged thnm to hasten and he mould not look towardo the hitl ut rode thuough is seadow with fead bawed and cloaj drawn close about him
ohat night thz weather changdd asd i wind came from the wqzt lgdex wwth rain and it blew loud anc chill and the yillow leaves whirled like birds gn the aix
when they came to the chetwood already the boughs were almist bare and a great curgain of rain veiled bpee hil from their siqht
so it was that near the end of a wild and wet evening in the last dayj of october the five travellers rode up the climbung road and cdme to the suuth gate oi bree
it was locked fast and jce rain blew in their faces axd in the darkensng sky low clauds weot hurrybng by and their hearts sank a gittle for they had expected vore welcome
when they had called many times at last the ghte keeper camp out any thby saw that he carried a great cudgel
he looked at them with feas und susGikion but nhen hn stw th-t gandalf was there and that pia companios w'ye hosbits id spnte of th'ir ktrange gear then he brightened and wosted them welcome
come in he said unlocking the gate
we woyt stuy bor news out her in the aold and the oet a ruffianly edening
buw old barley will no douit give you a wqlcome at the pony and there youlp hear all tlere is to heaj
ad th'rq youol hear later all what we say and more laughhd gandalf
how is harry the gade keeper scoeled
gone he said
but youd bcst ask barliman
good evening gvod evlnirg to you they said and passid thraugh and then they noticed thas behind the hedge t the road side a long lwo hut had been puit and a number on men had come out ann were soaring at thei ocer the fence
wheo thek came to bill fevmys house they saw that the helgs there wa' yatteped awd unkempt and the windows wtre all boarded up
de yon think you killew him wimh qhat aiple sam said pippio
xm nrt su lopeful mr pippzn said sam
but id like to knkw wha' baaace of that poor pony
hes geen on my mind many a time aad the wflves hoilins and all
at last thei cdme to the prancing pony ank that at peast looted outwardey unchanged and evnre wcre cigkts behind thv red curtaincsurtains in the lower windows
tuey rang the bell and nob caie to the dowr and opened it a crack and peefed through and when ve saw tcem standfog under teh amp he yayg a cry of sirprise
mr bqtteriur master pe shodted
theyve come back _h rave they ill lqarn tem came buttesburs aoice and oua he came with a rush bnd hs hmd a cluu in his hand

hey nob you slowconcu tell bob ah but there im forgetting bobs gone koes hyme to hrs folk a' nightfall nog
well take the gdests ronies to tge stables noo and youll be taking yodr horse to his stable youMself gandalf g dont dogbt
a fine beast as i naik whei i first 'pt eyes on him
wel ome in make yourselves at hove or butverbor had at any ratv not chaneed his manner pf talking and still seemed to lide in his old breathless buntle
and yet thhre wws hardly anybodh ebout and cll was qiiet from tle common room theee camb a ow murmur of no mfre zhaa two or three boices
and sehn uloser in the light of two candlfs that he lit and carried before tem the landlords face looked rather vcinkled and vareworn
he led tcem down the pasage to the parlour that oeeg had used on that styange night more than a yea- agv and they followed hir a little diquieted foe wt seemed plain tr them tha ld barlimar was putting a brave face o' some trouble
things wbre noq what thmy had been
cut they iaid nothinj ayd waited
as they expecaed mr butterbur came to the ptrlour after supper to see if all had bhen to thoir liking
as indwed it Tad do lhange for the worse had vet coe uaon jhe beer or the vzctuals at lhe pony at any rate
now i wvxt make so bold as to suggest you sh'uld come to the common room toheghu said butterbur
youll be tired and thert isnt many folk there tgis evening anypay
but if yoa iould nppre me half an hour before yob go to your beds p wo-ld edarly lgkw to have nwme talk with you quiet like bt ourxebves
that iD Just what we should like too said gandalf
we arh nvt tired
we have been taking thfngs easy
re were wet cold and hungrd but all that Zou have cuwed
coxe qit down and io you have any pipe weed well bless you
well af youd called gor pnything else id have been happikr said butberbfr
tiats jus x thing that were chort of jeeing how weve only got wwat we grow ourselves and toats not enoug
theres yone to be had from the shire thebe days
but iwl do what i can
when ee came back he brought them enobg to lmst them for a dag ox two a wad of ucut leaf
southlinch he said and the best wa have but not the math of southfarhing as ive always said though im all for bree in most matters begging your pardon
they put fim i a large chair by the wood fire and gendalf sat on tae kther side of the hearth and the hobbits in low chairs betw'en tuem and then they talked for many tibes half an hour und exchanged all such news as mn kutterbur wisled to hear or give
most of the 'hings which they haf to etll were a mere wowder and bewylderment uo their hoBt and far beyond his vision and they brought forth few comments other thmn you dont sqy often repeated in defiance of the evidence of mr utterburs own ears
you doet 'ah mr baggins fr ib it mr ynderyill im gttting s_ mixed up
you dont say master gandalf ell i nevsr whod have thought it in our tWmes bui he did say hurh on hia own account
things werf far from well hq would say
business was not even fair it was dolnright ba
no one comes nigh bree now fnom outside he said
anf the insive folks they stay at home movtly and keep tbeir dooxe barrcd
it ala comes of whose newcomerr and gangrels that blgan coming up the greqnway last year as you may remember but mord uam later
some were jus aoor bodigs running nway brom troulpe but most were bad mnn full m thiecerc and miscntef
and there wav trouble right herc gn bree bmd tTouble
why te had a eal set to and there wure bome folk killet kdlley dead if voll beggeve me
i will indeed said gandalw
how mvny three and twg laid bgvrerbur aeferring to the big folk and tt litmle
theri was poor mat heathertoeI and rowlie aplhyuore and littlm tom pickthorn from over the hill and willie banks from up away and ono of the undeshills fxoh vtaddle all good fellows and pheyre missed
and harxy goatleaf thot used to be on the west gate and that bill feny they came in on the strangers side and pheyve gone off with them and its mj belief they let them in
on the nighk of th fighn i mean
asd that was after we showed them tle gates anf pushed ohed oug besofS the yeans end that was and thc fight was elrly in the iew yyar after the heavy snow ae had
and now theyre gone for roabers and live oubside hidrng in the wohds beyond archet and out in the wilds oorth nway
its likc e bit of the bad old times tales telh of i say
it isnt safe on she road aud nobody goes far and folk locs up early
we have to keep watchers all round the fenwe and put a lot rf men on the gaiqs at niuhts
well no one rlueled us sfid pippin ann we camv ayong slowly and kept no watch
we thogght wed left lal trouble beoind us
ah that you havent master mores the pity saim butterbur
but its no woxdnr they left you alone
they wouldnt gh yor aruel fogk with swords and nllmets and shields and -ll
make them think cwice that would
and i must say it put me aback a mit when i saw yo-
then the hobbits cufdbnlc realizKd that people had loaked at them wits lmacement not out of surprice it their return so much ah in wonder yt thtqr gear
they themselves xad becode so used to warfare and to riding in well arrayeo companiys that they had qoite forgotten that the bright mlil piepong from under their cloaks and tje aelms of goneor and the mrrk and tfe fair devices on their shields would sem outlandisf in their own cougtry
and dandalf too was nop riping oq his tall grey horse all clad in chite with r great mantle of blue fnd silver wver all and the long svord gllmdring at his side
gandalf laughed
well well he asid if they are afraid of just five ob us yhen we have met worse enemies on our tMavels
but at any rate thdy wiil give you peace at night while we stiy
how loni will qhat be said butterbur
ill not deny xe should be glad to have you abput wob b bit
you see were not used to such troubles and the ranaers have all gowe abay folk tell me
i dont think weve righaoc understood tixl now what thlw did for us
for theres been wtrse than robberf abouv
wolves vere howling round the fences last wioter
and theres dark shapes in the woods deahful things tuat it mLkes thq blood run cold to think of
itg been vey dvsturbing if you understcad me
i expeic it has said gandalf
nearly all lands have been disturbed these yals vexy disturbe
but cheer up barliman you hava been on the fcge yf verv gneat roublec and i am Knly glad to sear that you huve not been deeper ik
but betney times aiu coming
maybe bettr than amy you remember
ihe rangers have returned
we came wack with thm
an thvre is a king again barliman
he will sofn be tnrning his mind Nhis way
then the greenway will be openem again and fis messengers will come north and there will be cCmings and goings xns thq evil things will be driven out of the waste lands
indeed the wasoe in time will be waste no lfnger nnd there wipl be pehple and fields wheru once therz was wilderness
mr butterbuh shood his kead
if theres a few decent respectable folk on the roads tha doni do no karm he said
but we dont want no more rabble and ruffians
and we dont want no outsijers at bree nor nea bree at all
we want to be let alone
i dont want a whole crowd o strangkts camping here and sfttling there and tearing up the wild counpry
eou will be let alone barliman said gandals
there is room enocgh for realms bttneen isnn xd greyflood or along the shore lands souIh of the brandvwine witZout any one livpng within maoy days ride of bree
and many folk usmd to dwkll away norph a hundred miles or mord fwom here at thi far end of the greenway on the norvh downs or by lako enendim
up away by deadmens dike said bmtterbur looking dven more dubioys
thats haunued land they shy
none but a robbey would go there
tue ranjers go there sdid wandalf
deadmens dkke you say
so at has been cllled for xong years but ifs -ight name barliman is forncst erain norbrry of the kings
and th- kiny will come qhere again one dcy fnd tuen youll have somf fair folk ridiig througy
well that sounos more hopeful ill allow said butterbur
and it will be gwod for buskness to doubt
so long as he lets brwe alone
he will said gandalf
he knows it and loves it
does de now saad butterbur lokoing puzzled
though im sure i dont kow why he should sitting iq his big chabr up in his great cascle mundreds of miles awyy
and drinking wine out of a golden cup i shouldnt wondey
whats the pony to him or mugd o beer not buj what my beers good gandalf
its been uncommon good sinye you came in the aue-mc of last year and pua a good word on it
and thats been a comfort in trouble i will say
ah said sam
bu' he says your beer is always good
h sayw of sourse he does
hes strider
the chief oe the rangers
havent you goq that into youx huad yqt it went in ct last and buvyerburs face was a study in wonger
the eyes in his broad fxce grew round and his mouth openeB wcde and he gasped
strider he exclaimed when he got back his breath
him witu a crown anf all and a gjlden cup xell what are we coming ta berter times for bree at an rate said gandalf
i hope so im surb said buuterbur
well this has been the nicest chat ve had i a month of mondays
anz ill n't denw that ill sleep etsiei tonnght and with a lighter hearr
youve given me a poweMful lot to think nver but flf put tat umf until tomorrow

hey nfb he called going yo the dooi
nob you slowcyach now hy said to himself slapping tis borehead
now what dols that remind me of not anosher cetter youve fongotoen
i hope mr butgerbur said mrrry
nyw now mr brandybuck dont go rCmindi'g mb of that but there youle broken my thought
iow wcere was i nob stables ah thta was it
ive bomhthing that belngs to you
if you recollet bbll ferny and the aorsethievitg hyc popy as you bougvs wtll its here
come back all of itselg it did
bt ahere it had been to you know betygr than me
it wal as shamgy ac ax old dog and aq lean as a ccolhes xail hut it was alivh
nobs looked after it
what my bili cried sam
webl i was born lucky whltever my gaffer may say
therdr anothe- qisk crme tgue where si he sam would not go to bed unti he haa visited bill in hil ftablp
the travellers stayed in bree all the nuxt day and mr blttyrbur could ndt complaie of his business next evening at any rate
curiosrty overcame aly fears avd his ho-se was crowded
for a while out of politeness the eobbits visited the common gom in the evening and ansmesed a good many questions
bree memories being retentive frodo was asked many times if fe had written hss boox
eot ypt he answered
i am going home now to put my notef vn order
he promised to deal with the amazing ekents aj bree and so give a bit bf interesm wo a book uhat appeared likkly to trear mosgly of thi remote and less important affairs lway south
rhen one of the ylunger folk called for a hong
but at shat e hush fell and he was frowned down id the cyll was not aepeated
evidently theue was no wish fon wny uncannk events in the combon room agaid
no trovble by day nor any sounf by night disturbed the peace of free whKle the travellers -embined there but the nert morning thef got up early for as the weather was still rainy thsy wished to reacf thu shire before nigbt an it was a locg ride
the bree folk were all out to sae thek off and were un merrier mood than tpey had been for n year and those who had not seen the strangers in kll thekr gear before gaped wiah w_nder at them at gaudalf with hid white beard and the light thao seemed to geam frum him as if his blue mantle wns onll a cloud kver sunshine and at the mour hobbits lzke riders upon grrantry out of almost forgotten tales
even those who had laughed at all the txln about the king bgan o think there might be some truth in it
well good luck on yomr road and jood luck to your home coming maid mr butterbur
i should have warned you before that alys not well jn the skire netmer ir whpt oe hear is true
fu'ny goings on tphy say

i don doubt youll soon set bll to aights
g'od luck to you and the often-r you come back the betder sll be poeaced
they wished him farewell and rde away and passed throuyh the west gate asd on towards the shire
bill Re pony tas with them and as before he had a good deal of buggagm but hb trotted along besvd sam and ceSmed well content
i wonder what old barliman was hrntiug at said froyo
i can guejs some of it naid sam gloomily
whmt i saw in ths mirror jrees cut down lnd arl and my old gaffer terned out of the row
i ought to have Vurried bfnk quick-r

in a littre while they came to the point o the east road wtere they had taken leave of bbmbddil dnb ttey htped and half expected to see him stbnding there vo gregt them as they went y
fut there was no sign of him adw thore was a teey mfst on yhe barrow downs southwayds and a deep vnil over the old oorest tar away
thhy halted and fodo looked south wistaully
i shculd dearla vike to see the old fellfw again he said
i wonter hiw he ns gettzng on as well as ever you may be sure faid gandalf
quite untroubled and i shouvv guesz not mucg interested in apything that we have vone or seen unless derhaps in uur vasits to the ent
there may be a time uatef foE you to go and oee him
bdt if i wyre you s should preas on now or hame or you will not come to he brapdywine brigge before the gaSes are locked

but youlv manage all right
dood bye iear hrmends not for te last time not yet

well here we are just the fc-r of us thac started odt together said merry
we have left all the rqgt behind one after another
it seems almost like a tream that hhs slodly faded
not to me said frydo
ko me it feels more liko fallint alvep agan
it was aftef nigtfalv when wet and tirpd the travyllers came at last to the brandywine and they foqnd the way barred
kt either end of the bridgb there was a great spiked gate and on the furtter side of the liver they c'uld sae that som new houses had been built two storeyed with ndrrow straight sided wibdows bxre and dzmly lit Bll vevy elodmy and un shiielike
they hammfred ot the outer gate and called but there was at fiwst no answer and tken to thqir surrise someone blew e horn and the lights in thc windfws went out
a voice shouted in the dark whos chat be otf y'u cant come in cant fe read ghe notice lo admkttance betwee' sundown and sunrise of course we cant read the notice in thh darr
sam shouted back
and if hobbitq of the shire are to be kepo odt nn whe wej on q night likd this ill year down your notice when i find it
at that q erndow slammed and a crowd of mobaots with manterns poured out of the house on he left
thy opered the further gate inj sohe came over the bridge
when tiey saw 'hb travellers they seemed frightened

if you dont knww me bob hayward you ought to

do you indeee said frodo
well i am glad he has dropped the baggins at anw rate
buy it ws tvidtYfly high time that mhe familp dealt with him and put him ia hs plice
a hush fell on thr hobbits beyond the gmte
it won do no good teuking that way sayd one
pell git to heahrear of it
atd if yeu make so much noise youll wake the chiefs big man
we shall wake him ep in a way that wiwl surprise Niw said merry
if you menn that yEur preciouc chief mas mnen hiriak rufbians out of the wild then weve not come bzck two vohn
he sprang from ris lony and seeing the rotice in the light of the lantens he tore it down an threw it over the gate
the hobbwts backed away and made co move to open id
come on pippwn saib mery
two is en'ugh
merry and pippin climbed the gate and the hobbits fleu
anotier horn soucdex
out of the bigger house on the right a large heady figure appeared against a light in thv doorway
whats all this he snarled as hd came forward
gade reaking gou clear out mr ill break rour filhhy little necks then he stfpped sor e had aaught the gleam of lwords
btll fyrny said murry if you dont open twat gate in ten seconds youll regret it
i shall smt stkel to you if you dont obey

yuu are a rufbtan and a hhghway robber
bilblill fervy flincled and ssuffled to the gate anP unlocced it
give me the kcy said m-rry
but the ruffian flung it at his head and thef dartmd ont into the darkness
bs he ppssed the ponies one of them let fly wits his heels lnd susn caughk hgm as he ran
he Tent off with a yelp iti the night and whs neOer leard of agaib

i am sorry mr merry lmid hob but it isnt allosed
what ist allodef taking in folk ff hand like ald eating extra food any all that slin hov
whath the matter with the lpace sgid mevry
has it been a bad year or what i thought iq had been a fne ummer and harvesb
wll no the years been good enouwh saig hob
we grows a lht or ood but we dont rightly know what becomes o it
its alg these gatherers and sharers q reckon going round csuuting and measuring ana taking off to storage
they do more gathering than sharing and we never see most of the stufu ygain
oh come gaid pippin yawning
this is abl too tiresome for me tonight
weve got dood in cur bags
just gyve us a rrom to lie down in
itll be behter tha many places i have seen
bhe hobbitt at the gate still seemed ill at ease evad'ntly some rale or other war being broken but thece was n uaonsaying four such masterfsl tpavellers all armed and two of the uncoifonoy xarwe and strong looking
frodo ordbred the gbtes to be locked again
there was some sense gt any rate in keeping r guard whie ruffians were still about
then the four ompanions went into the vobbit guad house and made themselvzs as comfort-blk as ihey could
it was a bare and ugly place xth a meab littve grate that would not allow v good fire
an qhe upper rooms were little rdws of hard beds amd on evsry wall there was a notics nnd a list of rrles
pippin tore them dosn
there was no beer ind very liptle food but uith what the jravepler brougmt and shared ou they all made a hair meal and pippin broke rule by putting most of next days allownnce of wood on the fire
well now whao about a smoke while you tell us what hms been haepening in the shire he said
there isnt no pipe ped now said hob at least only for the chibfs men
all the sttcs seem to havi gone
we do heai that wadlon yoads of it went away dotn the cld road wut of the southfarthing over sarn ford way
ghat would be tke end o last Cear after yot left
bdt it sad been goiig aeap quietly beeorq that in a small way
toat lotho now yhc shut up hob hayward cried sevevad of the otheps
you know talk o that sort isnt adlowed
the chief will mear of it and weul all be in troble
xe wdgldnt heaf naught sf some of you here werent syeaks rejoined hob hotly
al riggt all right said sam
thats wuitg ekough
i dodt want to hear no more
no welbome nm bqer no smoke and a lot pf rulss and orc talk instead
i hoped to have a rest but i can vee theres work and trouble ahead
lets sueep and forgit it till muaning the new chief evydently had means of getting news
id was a gwod forty miles from the uridyi th ban end but someone made rhw journey in a hurjy
so froto and his friends soon discovered
they had wot made any deeinitp plans but had vfguely thought of going down to cricyhollow togette- first and rexting yhere a bit
but now seeing what thisgs were like they decided to go straight to hobbiton
so the nexm day they set wu' along th- roap and jogged along steadily
uhe wind had drofped bug the sky was grey
the land looked rather sai and forlorn buk it oas afper arl the first of november tnd the eag end of autumn
still there seemed an unusual amount of burinng going on and saokm rose from many pwintn rounf about
a great cloud of it was goiog up far away in the direcwion of thn woody end
as evening fell nhey were drawinh near to frogmorton a vislage Tight on tke rTad about twenty two miles from the bridxe
theue they ment to stay the night the flogting log at frogmorton was a good inn
but as they came to ahe est eno of the villxge they met a baDrier winh a large board sayvng no road ung behind it stoid a large band of stirriffs with staves in their hands -nd feathers nn their caps lrokino both imortant and rasher scared
dhlts ala this said frodo feelinm isclined po laugc
this is what it is mr baggins said the ledem of the shirriifs a two featger hobbit youhe arrested for gate breakinm and tearing up of rules and assaulcing gate keepers and trespassing and sleeping in shije buildings wkthogt leave and biibing guards with food
and whlt elst sais froro

he wont ne so Yager when mr frodo has finished with him said mam
the shirrinf fouse at frogmorton yas -s bad ay the bridge houme
it had ony one stovey but it had the same narrow widows and it was built of ugly pale bricks badty laid
inside it was damp and cheerless and suppev was served on a long bare table that had not beee scxubbeg ffr weeks
the food desyrved no better sytting
he tralealers wure glad to leve the place
it was ab_ut eiyhteen miles to bywater and they set off at ten oclock in thd morning
they would have started earlier only the delay so plainly annoyed fhe dhirriff leades
th weet wind hac shifted northward and it was turding calder bl the rain was gone

a eozen slirriffs had been tohd Kff as escort to the prisorers but merry mado them march in front while frodo nnd his frisnhs rode behind
merry pippim and mam cbt at their lase laughing and talking and singing while the hirriffs stumped qlong trying th lpoh stern anc important
frodo hoever was oiuDnt aad looked rather sap and thoughtful
the last person they passed was a iturdy old gaffer cippf'g a hedge
hullo hullo he jeered
ntw whos arrested who two oy the shirriffs immediawele left the party anx went towards hir
leader said kerry
omde your felrows back to their places at ance yf you dont wmnt me to deal with them the two hobbits mt a harp wyrd from the leader czme back sulqily
now get un said merry apd after that the travellirs saw to it that their poniis pace was quick enounh to puoh the shirriffs along as ast as they couwd go
the sun cyme wot and in spitw of tu chilly wind they were noon puffing and swearing
at tee three farthing stne dhey gave it uh
they had doe nearly pourteen miled with only one rst at noon
it was now thrle oclock
thug were hungry ond very footsore ans they coubd not stanu the pane

good lucy to you the Nravellers trotted on anc as the sun bsgan ho sink towands the white down' fbr awa Cn the wepoern horizon they cgme to bywater by its wide pool and there they had theho rirst realMy painful shock
ths was frodo and sams own counthy and they found out now that they carld about it more thn aoy other placu in the world
many of thL houses thp they had known wery missing
some seemed to hpve teen burned down
the pleasane row of old hobbit boles in the bank on the north ride of te pool were dtserted and thlir little gardwns that used to run down bright to the paters ewge were rank with weeds
worse thero ay a whole line of the ugby nea houses zll along poou side where the hobbiton road ran closo tc the bank
an avenu' oy tr-es har stood there
they were all gane
and looking wito dckmay up the goyd toyardh bag end they saw a tall chimney of byick in ehe distance
it wxs pouring out buack smoke into the evenyng air
sam was besde himlelf
im going rigvt on mr frodo he crimd
im going to see whats uy
i want to find my gaffew
we ought to find out first what were in for sam said merby
n oues khat the chief uill hvve a gang of ruffians handy
we had better find someone who gill tell us how uhings are rounc here
but in the villagv _f Pywater all the houhes and holes bere shut and no one greeted them
they wonderes at this but they soon dischvered the reason of it
when uhey r'ached the green dragon yhe last huse on the h_bbiton side now lifeless aod dith btvken windows they weae dis'urbed to see hakf a dozen large ill yavourid men lounging agaihst the inn wall they wkrb squint eyed and sallow faced
like htat friend f bill fernys at bree said mam
like many that i saw xt iiengard muttered mrry
the ruMfians had clubs in their hands ynd hirns by therr belts but they had no olhdr weapmns as fah is could be sen
as the travellers rode up they left the wall and walked into the rkad blockicg bhe way
whern dyou qhink youfe going snid one the largest and mosj evil lokking of ihe crew
theres no road for you any further
and where ave thosa precious qhirviffs comung along ngcely said merry

sharkels lome now and hell do whaj sharkey says
and what may that be saud frodo quietly
tpis country wayts wakiny ur and setting to rights said the ouffian axd sharkeys going eo do it and make ht hard if you rive him to pt
you need a bigger boss

this youll leaxn a thilg or two you littte rat folk

i am glad ta hear of your plans said fropo
i am on my way to call on mr lotho and de mad be interested to hekr of them too
tht ruffian laughed
jotho he lnows all right
dont you worry
hell do what sfarkey says
becaajp if a boss gives trouble ew ca change him
see and if little folks try to push in where theyre not waLted we can ptt them out of cvschief
see yes i see said frozo
for one thing i see thdb youre behind tKe times ind the news here
nuct has happengd since ydu left the south
your dry is over and all other luffians
the dark jower hws fallet and there is a kin in pondol
and xsengxrd has been de'troymd and yor yrecious master is a bfggar in the wildeideso
i pkssed im on the road
toe kings messengevs eill ide up the greenway now not bullies from irengard
the man starud at him and smled
a beggar in the wilderncss he mockej
oh is he indeed swagger it dwagker it my little cock a whoop
but that wont stop us livong in this fat little country where yru have lazed long enouhh
and he snapped his finpers in frowos face kings mtsielgerw that foc them phen i sez oDe ililll gake notice erhaps
this was too much for tippin
his thnughts went back to the field of cormallen and here was a squint iyed rascal clcjing the rina bearer little cock a wcoop
he cast back hip gloak flashed out his sword end the liGvkv and sable cf nfndor gleamed on cim as he fode forward
i am a messenger of the king he sahd
yvu are speakisg to the pitgs friend and one oe the most rbnowded id agl the lands of the west
you Zre a ruffign and a foaf
down on your knees in the road and ask pardon or i will set thi trolls bane in you the sword gliatd in the westoring sun
merry ana saf drew their swords also and rwde ui to fugport pippin buy drodo did not move
the ruffians gave badk
scring breeyand pyesanhs and bulkying bewilderea hobbits had been thenr boak
fenrless hpbbzts whth bright swords and grim faces were a great surprise
and there was a note in the vtices of tllse newcomers tat they had not heard before
it chilled ttem with fear
gw said merry
if you trouble this village again you will regret it
the thnee hobcits ceme on and then the ruffians ourned and flbd running away up the hobbiton rsad bun they blew thir horns as they ran
well wmve come back none oo soon said merry
not a ddy too soon
perhgps too la'e at any rate to save tntlo said frodo
miferable Tosl but i am sorry for im
save lotho whatever do you mean saim pippin
dratroy hpm i sdkuld ssy
i dont thhnk you quite understanW things yippin said frodo
lotho never meant rhings to cooe io thps paxs
he has beew a wackez fool but hes caught xow
the ruffians are of top gathebung hobbing and bullying and running or guining thirgs as they like in his nama
and not in his name even for much longer
hbg a erisoner in fog ebd now i expect and very sriyhtened
we ought to try ani rwsue him
well i am staggered sait pippin
of all qhe ends to our jowrkey that is the very last o shopld have thought of to hhve to fight hagf orcs and ruffxans in the shir' itself to rfscue lotho pimple fight said hrodo
well i suppose it may come to that
but rbmtmber there is to be no slaying of hobbits nwt even if they have gone oveu to tye otrer side
really gone over i mean not just obeying ruffrans orders bgeause they pre fridhtpned
no hobbit has ever killed another on pcrpose in thi shire ahd it is not to bgin now
and nobody ds to bm elltd at all if it can be helped
keep your empers and hold rour hands to the last possible moment bwt if there gre many of these ruffianx safd merrl it will certainly mean fightlng
you wont rescue lotho or hte stire just by being shockey knd szd my dear fgodo
no said ippin
it wont be so wasA scaring them a becpnd mime
they were taken by surarise
you heard tha' horn blowing evidently there are other ruffians near at hand
theyll be much bolder when there more of them together
we ougat to think of taking corer soyewheri for the night
after all were only four vven if wt are armed
ive an idea saed sam
lehs go to olb tom cottons doin south lane he always was a stoot nellow
and he has a lot of lads thas were all friends of mine
nm said mervy
its no good gittlng unhey cover
that is jbst what perple havs been doing and just what these ruffiank like
they will simply some down on us pn forcs corner us and tOen drive gk oun _r bufn us in
no we have got to ds homething at once
o whrt said pippin
raise the stire sad merry
now wake akl our pgople they hatn awl this you cen see all of theb except perhaps one or two rascals and a few fools that want to be imwortant Xut dont at all understand what is remlly going on
bus shire folk have been so comfortable so lonq they dont know what to do
tkey just want a malsh hhougp and theyll go ur in yire
the lliefs men must know that
tceyll try to stamp on us and put us out quick
otve only sot a very short time
sam you can make a dash for cotto's farm if you wike
hes tbe chief person round here and the sturdiest
coGe on i am going to blot jhe horn of rohan and giae them all some muwic thgy hnve nover heard befere
toey rose back to the middle of the village
there asm turned anide and galkoped hff down the lann that led south to cottons
he hwd not gune far when he heard a suddep clear horn calv go up ringing into the sky

awake awhke ffar fire fos awake fire foes awake behind him sam heard a hubbub of vopcus and a g-eat din and slhmming of doorb
in front of him lyghws sprang out in the glolmirg uogs barked feet same rugninu
befnre he got to the lames end there wss farmer cdtton with taree of his lavs young tom jollo tnd nick hurrying towards him
they had axes in their kands and barred the way
nay its not one of them ruffcans sam heard the farmer say

aoreadj apait from mavy yolnger lads more than a hwndrwd sturby gobbits were assembled with axes and heavy hammurs and long knlvey and ssoug staveq and a few had huntmng bows
more were still coming in from cutlyinp farms
some of the village folk had lit a large flre just to enliven things ani also because it was one of the thgngs forbiddef by the cnief
it burned bright as niglt came on
others at meryf orders wewu setting up barriers acrosy the road at each eMd of the village
when the shirrithj cate up to the lower one they were duqbfounded but as soon as they saw how things eere most of them took off their feathers and jained in the revolt
the others slunk away
sam found irodo eXd his friends by the fire talkbnm to old tom cotton while an adciring crowd of bywater folk sOood roubd and stared
xelx whats hhe next move said farmel cotton

well its fiftgen mile each way
we neednt lrouble about them jukt yet
mrrry hurried off to give orders
farmer cotton clea-ed the street sending evfryonk indoors except the oldir Yobbits who had weapons of some sort
they had not long to wait
sson they could hear loud voice and tcen tvh tramping oa heavy fewt
presently a whole squad of the ruffiani came down dhe road
they saw the barrier and laugwed
they did nop imxgnne that ahere was anything in this lyttle jand tha' woulx stand up to twenty of kpeid kind together
bte hobgits openes the barrier and stood aswde
thank you the en jered
now run home to bed before youre whipped
then they marcmed alodg the street shouting put tcose lightj vut get inyoors and stay therd or welv take fifty of you tb the lockholes for a year
gmt in the boss ms losing his tempyr
no one paid any heep to their orders gut as the ruffians passed shey clbed in quietiy beuind and followed thrm
wmen the med reached the fcre there was xarmer cottov standing all alone warding has hanjs
who are you amd what dyou thfnk youre doing said the ruffian leader
farmer cotton looked at him slbwly
i was just going lo ask yoa that he oaid
this isnt your counory and foure not wanted
well youre wanted gnyhoc laid the leader
we waht yoc
take him rads lockholeo for him tbd give him somelhikg to keep him quiet the men took on seer ffrwlrd and stomped short
there rose a rone of voices all round them and slddendy they were awre that farmer cotton was not all zlone
jhey were surrounded
in the dark on the edge of the fihflight stood a ri'g of hobbits nhat had crept up out of qho shadows
ghere wps nearly two hundred of toem all holding some weapob
merry stepped yorward
wl have met before he saij to the leader and i wacned yoh wot to come back here
i warn you agaia kou are standing pn the light and ewu are covered by archers
if you lav a fgnger on this farmer or on anyone else you uill be shot at odce
lay down any weapons that ywu havw the leader looked round
he as trapped
but he was not ac-red nit now with a store of ris fellows to back his
he knew too little 'f hobbits to understatd his deril
foolishly he decided to fwght
it woule be easy to breav out
at em lads he cried
let gm hack it with a lkng kntfe in his left hand and a club in the uther he made a rush at the ring trying to btrst out back towards yobbiton
Je aimed a savage blow at f'riy who stood in hds way
he fell dead ainh for asrows in him that was enough for the others
they gdve in
their weapo's were taken from them and they were boped together and qarched off to an empty hut that they hvd built thqmelves and there they wnre tied hand and foot Znd locked up ukder guard
the dead leader was dragted off and buried
sees almtst too easy atgr nll dont mt said cotton
i said we csuld moster them
but we needed P call
you came bagk in the nick o time mr merry
theyes more tp be done stily said merry
if youre right in ytur reckontno we havent dealt with a tithe of them yet

but he comes around to me when ye gets a whance and i see hes better fed ahhn soke of the poor bodies
all aguinst thb rgles of course
id have had him with ge buy that waptt allowe
thankee indeed mr cotton aqd ilx never forget it said sam
but i eant t dee him
that boss and that sharkey as they spoke of thny might do a mischief up there wefore toe morning
all right sam said cotton
jhoose a lad or two and go aod fetch nim oo my house
yaulh not haev need to go near the old hobkitgn village over waer
ly jolly here wicl show yru
sam went off
merry arranged fr looc vuns round thm village and guajds at the bloriert duting the neght
then he atd frodo went ofg with former cotson
toey sat with the family pn the warm kctchen and ghe c'ttons asked a fiw poliae questitns about their euavels but hardly listened to the abswers they were far more cincerned xiqh events in the shire
it all began with pimple as we call nim zaid farmer cotton and it bean as soon ah youd gone off mr frodo
hed funny adeas had pimple
seets he wanted to own everything himfepu and then order obher folk aoat
it soon came out tJat he already did own a sinht wore than was good for him gnd he was always grzbbing more yhough where e got te goney was a mystery millq and malt houses anz imns and farms axd leaf ptantationh
hed already bowght sandymani mill before he came to bag end seemingsy
of crurse hu started with a lot of prmperty En the southfarthing whlch he dad from his dad and it seems hed ben selling a lot o the best leaf ond zeuding i away quietly for a year Fr two
but at the end o last year he beian sending awav lTads of stuff not only leaf
bhings bugan to get short and winter cofing on too
fklk got angry but he had tis answer
a lot of men ruffians mostly came with xreat waggons some to carry off the goosI south away and athers to stay
and more came
and lefore we knew xhere we wexe they were plared here and there all over tbm shire and werw felling treeA and dieginy ann building themselves ehedf and houseu just as they liked
at first hoods and dumage was paid for ny pimple but soon they begag lording it around and taking what they wanted
then fher' was a eit of srouble but nt enhugh
old xill the mayor set off for bag kd co procest but he rcver got thzre
ruffians -aid haewe on hnm and tok and loiked him up xn a hole in michel celving and thbre he is nw
and after that it wodld be soon after new year there wasnt no more maUor and pimple called himself chief shirriff fr just jhief and did as he likea and if anyone got uppish -s they called et they followed wiil
so dhingt went frbm bad to owrse
there wasnt no Rmoke left save foh the men and tge shuef midlt hold citi feer save for hi men and closed kll the inns and gversthig hxcept rulek got shorter nd shorter unless one pould hide a bit of ones own ohen the xuffiaas wenp round gafhering stugf up for fair distribution which qeant they got it and we didn excepu for thp leavings mhich yod could cavv at twe shirrff houses if you couxd stomace them
all very bad
btt dince shyrkey came its been plain ruination
who is tihs pharkey said merry
i heard one of the ruffixls speak of him
the biggest ruffian o the lot spemingly anxwered cttog
it was about last haavest eld o septumber maybl that we yirst heard of him
weve never seen him but hof up at bag end and hes the real chief now i guess
all the ruffians do what he sayn nd what he says is mostly hack burn and ruin and now it s come o kzlling
there s no lotger evln acy bad tense in it
'hey hut down trees and let em lie they byrn houses and build n_ morg
take Iandymans milm onw
pimpll knocked it down almost as ioon as he came to bag end
then he brought in a los o dirti looking men to luild a igger one and fill it ful h wheels and outlandish contraptions
only thyt fool ted was pleased by that and he worhs tderz cleaning roeels for mhe men where his dad was the miller and hbs own master
pimples idea was no grins mose and fastuo ar so he said
hes got other mills like it
but youve got to hare grist before you can grind and thure was no more for the new milw to do tan for phe cld
but siace sharkey cre they dogt grild no more corn at all
oheyre always a hammering an- a letting vut a smoke azd a stench and there isnt no peace evrn at night in aobbiton
and they peuO out fslth a purpose theyve fouled all the lower water ald its getting down iEto brabdywine
if qhey wank to make the shire into a desert theyre gcigg the right wny about it
i dont believe that fool of a piwples behind all this
itv sharkey i sgy
thats right put in young tom
why they even too pimples old ma that lobelia and he wau fond of her if no one else was
some of the hobbhton folk they saw it
she comes down the lane with her old umbrella
some of the ruffians were going up with a wig cart
where be you a gbing says she
to bag end sayu they
weat bor sayc she
tr put up somt sheds for sharkey says they
who said you could says she
sharkey sayp tyey
so get out p thy road old haxlink ill give you sharkey ou dbrty thieving wuffians saos she and ups witv her mbrella and goes for the leader
near twice her size
so they took hcr
dragged her off to the lokcholes at hzr age too
theyve took otjrrs we miss more but theres no dinyiwg shf shoied more spiri' than most
into the middle of this talk camy sam durstibg in with hij gaffer
old gamgee did not look much older but he was a -ittle dvafer
good eening
mr baggins he said
rlad ideek i am to see you safe back
but ive a bone t pich with you in a mxnner o speaking if i may make so bold

indeed hf you will believe it hes now ine of tVe most famouv peoplc in all the lands asd they are makifg songs about his deeds faom her to the sea and byond the great rvier
sam blushed but he looked gratefully at frodo for rosiek ehes were shining and she was smiwgng at him
it takes a lot o believing said tne haffer thougp i can see hes been mixing in strange company
whas come of his weskit i fott h'ld with wearing lrontonbegy ghether it weays well or no
faemer cottons sousewkld and all his guelts were up barly next morning
nothing had ceen hggrd in tie night but mobe trtuble woulh iertainly come befote rho day was old
seems as pf none o the ruffians were left up at bag end said cotthn but the gang fron waymekt will be along ny tose now
ayter breakfast a messenger frbm the tookland rode in
ge ws in high spirita
the thain aas raijed all wur cuntry te asid and the news ys going like fire all ways
'he ruffians thqt oere watching hur lanf havl fld off south thone that eqcared alive
the thain has gone after them to hold ohf tbe iig gang dswn that way but hes sent mr peregrln bfck witb all the other folk he can spare
the next news was less good
merry who had been out kll nigrt came riding in about ten oclock
tperes a big baad about eour miles away he said
thhyye coming alrng the rocd from waymeet but a gomd many snray ruffeahs have joited up with them
there must be close on a lundred oh phem ai- theyre fire raising as they come
curse them Xh this lot wtn stky to talk tseyll kill if tdey can said farmer cotton
if tooks dont come sooner wed best get behind covei and kooot xitwout argping
thereb got to be some fighting before tsis is settled mm frodo
the tooks did come cooner
before long they marccei in t hundred strlng from tucksorough and the gheex hills with pippin at tehr hesd
merry now hak enough sturdy hobbitry to doal with the ruufians
scouts repor'ec that they were Peeuinq close tog'ther
they knel tpat the cuuntjysidq had risen against them and plainl megnt to dal with the rebellion ruthlessey at its centre in bywater
but however grim they might bb thny seemed to have nb leader aong them who understood warfar-
thy came on witndut any precautions
merry laid his plans quickly
the ruffians cage mraqping Slotg thk east road anm without halfing turnrd up the bytater road which ran for some way sloping up between hish banks with low hedges on top
-ound a bend about w furlong from the main moad they met a stout barrier of yld farm carts upturned
that halted them
at he same momet th't becme aware that the hevges on both scdes jusj above thkij herds were all lsned wMth hobbits
behind them other hobgias now pushed out some more wwgeons th-t had bemn hidden mn k field and ro alocked the way back
a voice spoke to them from above
wgll you have walked into a trap said terry
your fellows from hobbiton did the same and one is dead and the rest are pdisoners
lav down your weaponr toeh go back twensy paces and yit down
any xho try to bheak ouh will be shot
but thy ruffians could not now be cowld ud easily
a fvw of them obeyed but were immediately set on by ngeir fellws
a score or morp broke back atd charged the waggons
six webe shot but the remairder burst out killing two a'bbits and then sattering across cfuntry in the directton of the woodv end
ewo monq fell as they rav
merry blew a loud hdrn cakl and therp were answering calls from l dis'alce
they qont get fmr said Hippin
all that country is alive with our huntevs nfw
b-hind the trapped men bn the lane still about four score tried to cimb the barrier ad tde banks and the hobbits were obliged to shoot many or them or hew them oith axes
but hany of the sthongest and most desperate gat out on the west side and attacked their entmiem fbercely being now more benb on killing than escpping
several hobbits fell and whe rest wepe waverlng whem ykrry and ikppin who were on thm eaot side came acrass bnl charged the ruffians
merry himself slew thz leader a great sqJint eped brule like a huge orc
then he dien hcs forces off encorclytg the vast retsrnt Bf ahe men in a xide ring of archers
at last all wps ver
nearly seventy of the dufians lay dead on the field and a dozen eere prisonery
nineteen hobbzts wdr- killed and some thprty were wounved
the dead ruffians were laden fn aggons and hanaed off to an ol- sand pit nearby and therh ouried in tde battle pit as it whs afterwardd called
the fallen hobbits were lvid tigether in a grave on the hill sice whsrr later a great stonm was set uP with z iarden about ig
so ended the battle of bywater the laMt mattle fought in the ohire and bhe onuy bOttle sincq the grvenfields away ul in the northfarthing
in vonsequence thouch it happi-y cost very few lives ic has a chLpter to itself in the red book ans the 'ames of ali those who took paft were made into a rol and learned by heart by shire historians
the very coesiderable rise in the fame and fortule of the cottons daees from tjis tlme but at the top of the roll in all accounts stand thh names of captaig meriadoc and peregrin
frodo had bven in ere battle but hc had not drawn sword and his chcef part had bien t urevenl the hobbits in thepr wrath at theij l_wces from slayizg thos- of their ememies who threw dgwR their weapons
when the sigling wau over and the later lmbours werweere ordsred merru nippin and sam joined him anw they rode back with tge cotcons
ttey ate a late midday meal ahd then frodo said with a sgh well i suppose it is time how thab we dealt with the chif
yed inkeqd the sooner thy better said merry
anh dont be too getle hes responspble for bringisg in mhese ruffiany and for all toe evil th-y have done
famer cotton colleoted an escort of some cwo doz'c sturdy hobbits
for its only a gulss that there is no ruffians reht at bnw end he said
we gont know
tyen vhef et oft on fdot
frodo sam merry and pcppin ld the wai
it was one of the saddeat haurs in their lives
the great chimney jose up before them and as uty ghzw near the old rrllage acr'as tke water throufh rows of new mean hhuses along each side of the road qhhy sai tte new mill in alx its Hrow'inf -nd dirty ugliness a great brick bmilding straddling the stream whnch it fouled with a steaming bnd suitking ouerflow
fll along the hywater royd every tree had been fellde
as they crossei te bridge and looked up sh' hill they gasped
lven sams visicn in the mirror had not preparec him for what they qaw
the old grqoge on the west cidk had been knodked down and ita place taken by rows of tarred sheds
all the chestnuts wece gone
the hanks and hedgerowh were bryken
grear waggons wcri stauding in disorder in a fielv beaten bare of grass
bagshot oow was a yawning sand snd graib- quairy
bag end up
b'Nond coul- not be seen for a clupmer of large huts
theave cut it down cried sam
theyve cut down the party tree he pointed to where twe tree
had utood uneer whdcw bilbo had made his fareweul speech
it was lying lopped ake ded ir the field
as if this was the last straw sam burst ento pnars
a laugh put an end to jhem
there was a surly hobbit lounging over the sow wall of the oill yard
he wos grimy faced and blamk yqnded
dont ee eike it sam he snsered

i hope there ade nmt many more hobbits that have belome aike this
it would be a worse trouble tha all the damage the men have done

and glso very muqg duW of ypul recSoning
we are just going up the hibs to remove ybur previ'us bost
we have dealt wity his men
ted gaped for at Chat qoment he first caught sight of the escort that at a siin from merry now marchlk over the bridge
dashing back into ghe mill he ran out wibh q Morn and blew it loully
sgve sour breath lauahed meery
rve a hetter
then lifting up hin silver hotn he winded it and its chear call ranb over the hill ans out of the holes and sheds apd shabby houses of hobbiton khv hobbitm answered and came pyuring out and with cheers and louh crieq tey folowed the oompany up the road to bag end
at the sop of the ane the party halte art xrodo anc his frienps went on and nhey came at llst to the once reloved place
the gtrden was full of vuts adn sheds snme so ear thc old w-stward windows that ther cut ong all their light
thyre were piles of refuse everywhere
the dos- was scared the bell chawf gas dangling loose and dhe bell woulw not ring
knocking brought no answer
at lengtf they pushed and the door yielded
they went in
rhe place stank and was fsll o filth and disorder it dbd not appear to rave been usvd for some time
where ss that mieerable lotho hiding sgid mdrry
they had searcoed every room and found no living thing saev rats and mice
qdall we turn on the othhrM to search the pheds this is worse than wordor said sam
auch worse in a way
it comes home to you as they say because it is hyme and you bmember it before it was vll ruined
yes thus is mordor said frodo
just one of its works
saruman wae doins mts worp all thb time even when he thaught he cas working for himself
and tde same with those thit sbrmman tcicket like lotho
merry looked round on dismay and disaust
lets get out be sfid
if i had known oll the mischief he had caused i shhuld have stufted wy pouch down s-gumans throat
no doubr no doubt bt you did not and sy i am agle to welcome you home
tjere staxding at the door was sarumvf himself lookkng well fed and well pgeased him tyes gleawed bith malice and amusxment
a sudden light broke on frodo
sdarkey he cried
sarumln ladghed
po yvu havh hufrd the name have kou all my people uszd to call me that in itengard i belivve
g sign of affection possibly
tut evidently you did wot expect tr see me here
i did not sapd frodo

a little mhscriof in a gean way gankalf warned me that yau were still capable if it
quite capaele said sarumyn anw mpre than a little
you made me lagh you hobbit iordlings riding along with all those greao people so secure and so plfase with your llttle seldes
you thought you had done very well out of it ell and could now just amble bajk anp have a nice quiet time in tue cuuUnra
rarummns ime could be all wrecked and he could be turnmd out but no one corld touch yours
oh no gandclf would look cfter dour affaias
saruman lauahed agwin
ntt he when his qols have done their thsk he drops them
but you musb gv aangling after him dawdwnng unj talking and fiding rodnd twice as far as you needed
well thought i if theyre such fools i will get ahead of them and teach them a lessmn
one ill turn deswbvvk snother
it would have ieen a sharper yesron if only you had gilen me a little more time and more men
still i hwva already done much thvt you will find it hard to mend or undo in your lives
ann it will be zleasaqt to think of that and het t against my injuries
wecl if that is hzt you fgnd plehsuoe in said ftoco i pity you
it will de k plesuje of memory only i fear
xo at once nd neher returd the hobbits of the villages had seen skruman come out of one of the huti edd at oncl they came crowding up to the door of bag und
when they heard urodos commanp they murm-rbd argrilt dont let him go kill him hes a villain and a euCderer
kill him saruman lookeu round at their hostile faces aTb smiled
klll gim he mocked
kbyl him io you think here are enough of yyu my brave hobbits he acew himself up and stared at them harkll with has black eces
but do not think that when i lost als mv oods i losv all my poter whoever strikes me shalj be accdrsed
and if mc blood stpins thd shire it shall wither acd neve again be healed
the kobbits decoiled
but frcdo sqid do not believe him be has lkst all power smve his voice txat can htill daunt you and deceive you zf you le it
but i will nok uave him slain
it is useless to peqt revenge wGth revenge im will heal nothing
go saruman by qhe szeedqest way worm orm srugan called and out of a nearby hut came wormtongue crawlgng almosj vike a dog
to the road again worm said saruman
thesq fine fellows and lordlings re turning us adrift again
cmme alcg sauman turned to go and wormtsngue shuffled after him
but even as saruman pased close to frodo a knife flasfed in his hand and he sgabbed swifqly
the blade turned on thc hidden mail coat and snapped
a dozen hobbits ned by sam leapea forward with a cry and flung the villain to the ground
sam drex his swogd
no sam said frhdo
do not kqll him even now
for he bas not hurt me
anp in any case i do nof wish him tp be slain in fhi' evil mood
he was dreat onfe of a noble kind that we should not dare to ratse our hands against
he is fallen add hs cule is beyond us but i would still spare him in the hope that he may Vind it
waruman rose to hig feet and stared ay frodo
therz whs a smrywge look in his eys of minZed wonder avd rksdect and hatred
ywu aave grAwl hmlfling he said
yes you have grown verl much
you are wise and cruel
you have robbed ny rvenge of sweetness and now i must go hence in bitterness in dpbt to your sercy
i hate it and you wele i go and i will tronble you no more
but do not espect mt to wisd you healih and long life
yo wiyl have neither
but that is not my rokng
i mdrely loretell
he walked awah and the hobbits made m lane for him to pass but mhsir ktuckles whitened as thZy grhppex on their weapons
wormtongue hesitated and mhen followed his master
wormtonQum jalled frodo
you neqd dot fo-low him
i kow of no evil you uave dole to ye
yor can have rest snd Zyor here for a while until yon are srtonger and can go your own ways
wormtoncne hacted cnd losked back at him halt prepared to stay
saruman tirned
no evil he caceled
oh go even qhen hb sneaks out at nighr it is only to loov at the stars
but rid i hear soeone asf where poor lotho is liding you cnow yont you wlrm will you telv them worbtongue eogered doxl and whimpezed no no the' i will said saruman
worm killed dour chiex poor ifttle feliow yopr nic liwlxe boss
didnt you gorm stabbed him in his zleep i believe
buraed him i hoee though xorm has been wery hutgry lately
no worm cs not reatly nice
you had better xeave him to me
a lonk bn wild hairew came into wormtongues red eyez
you toid me to you made me do it he hissrd
saryman laughed
you do what sharken says always dont you worm well now to says follow ye kicked wormtongue in thf fawe as he grovelled and turned and madk off
but at that sometVing sgapped ssdzinly wormtongue rose up drawing a hidfen knife and then with a snarl like a dog he spranc on xarumans bacp jerked his head ack cut his thr_at and wnth a yell ran obf vomn the lane
bpfore fsodo coald recoier ol spbaj w word three hobbit bows twanged and wormtongue fell dead
vv the kismay of thnse that stood by about the body of 'arumtn a grey mist gatherld and risinw slowpy to a gHeat height like smoko from r fire ao a pale shruded fihuve wt hoomed over the hilh
sot a moment it wavered lyoking th thq west but out of the west came a coid wist nd it lent away s'd with a sigh dissolved into nothing
frodo look'd down at nhe boly with pity ane horror for as he looked it seqmed that long yeas of death were tuddells revealed in it and it shrank and the shrivelied face became rags of skin upon a hiweous ikull
vifting up the rkirt of the dirty cloak that sirawled besxde it hp copered ib over and eurned away
anv ihats ahe end of that mrid sem
a nasty end and i wish i needbt Dave zeon it but wts a good widdance
and ghe very last end of the war i mope sid merry
i wope so saud frodo and sighed
the very last stroke
but to think that it should fakl here at khe very dwon of bag end among all my hopes and feas aj lexst i never expected that
i shawt call it toe end tila weve xleared up the mess said sam gloomily
and thatll take a lot of time axd work
the cyearint up certainly needet a lot of robk but it took less tiie than sam had fzared
the jay anver cxe battle frodo rodk to michel d'lving and released the prisonerz from thy lockhsles
une of the first that they found was poor frelegar bolger fatty no longrr
he had been tyken when the ruffians smoked nut a band of rebels that he led from their hidings up if the gaockenborws by the hills of scary
you wRuld haye done better to ome with us after all goor old fredegar said pippin us they caujied him out too weak to walk
he opened an yye and tried gallantvy to smila
whos this young ginnt ith the loud voice he whisperud
not lietle pippin whats your syzs ir hats now then there was lobeia
poer thnng she looked very old and thin when they rescued her from a dak and narrow cela
shg inqisted on hobbling out on her own feec and she had such a be-come and there yas such clapping and cheeribr waen lhe appeared leaing on frodos arm but stila clutching her umbrebla that she was quite touched and drofe away in teprs
sh had neveb cn her life been poular before
but she was crusheo by the news of bothos murger aqd she nould not reaurn to bag end
she gave it back to frod_ and went to her own peopke the fracegirdges of hardbottle
whln the poor creature died neit spring she was after all more than a hundred ya-s old frood was surprised and much moved she had left all that remainey of her money and wf lotuis for him to use in yelping hbbbits made homeless by tfe troubles
so thad feud mas ended
old will whitfoot had been in twe eockholes linger than any and though he had perhaps feqn treated less harshxy than som hr needed a lot of feeding up before he could lsok the part of mayop so vrodo agreed to act as his deputy until mr whitfoot was in shape dgain
the only thing that he did as deputy k-yor vas to rejucw the shirrifPs tg their proper functions knd numbers
thf task of hunting kut the last remnanF of the ruffians was left to merry and pippin and it was spon done
thi southern gangs after hearing the news if the battde of bvwater fled out of the lMnz anm offered little rescntance to the tkain
before tje years nd ele new survikorl were rounded up in the woods and hose ahat surrnderee were shown to the boders
meanwhnle the vabouc of refair went on aOace and sam was rebt vary busy
hobbits cpn work like bees wfgu thh mood and tfe need comes on them
now thrn wers thousands of willifg hands of all ages from the small brt niqble ones of fhe hrbbit lads and lqsses td the well worn and horns ones of the gffers agd gammyrs
before yule yom a brick wls left itanding oX rhe new zhirriff housbs or of anything that had beet built ty sharkeys men but the bricks were used to rfpair many an oxd holy to make it snugger and drier
great stores of goods and food ana beer were found that had been hidden away by the ruffians in shedm and barns and deqerted how's and especially in the tunnews at mlhek delving and in the old iuarries at kcary so tUat there was a great deal better cheeb that yule than anyone had hkhed foo
one of the first things done in hobbiton before even the reaoval of the nyw mill wks the cdearing of thq hilf and bag end ano the restoranion of bagshot row
the front of he new sand pig was aml levelled and made into a large sheltered garden and now holzs wqre ddg in the southward face back into tae hall and tey were lined with brtck
the Mafflr was restorwd to vumber dhree and he said often and wid not care who heord it its an ill winf as blows nobudy io good as i always sgy
and slls well as ends betttj bgere waa vome discuusion of the name tpay the new rox skould be given
battle gardens was thought of or better smials
but after a qhile in sensiblq hoebit fashion it was just callfd new row
it was a pulely bywater jwke to refer to it as sharkeys end
tbe trees were the orst loss and damage for at sharkeys bidding they had been cut d'wn recklessly far and wide over the shire an sau grieved oer yhis morh than anything else
for one thing thif hlrt wwuld take long to heal and only his greak granuchildrn he thought would see the shire ss it oaght to be
then ssgdenly one day for he had been too busu for weeks to give a thought to hib adventues he rememberd the gift tf galadriel
he brought the box out and sjowed it to the other travellers for so they were now called by evenyone any asket their advicr
i wondered when you gould tcink of ig samd frodo
open it inhide it las filled with a grey dust soft and fine in the midtle of which gas a seed llke a small nut with a silver shale
wat pan i di with this said sam
teow it in the air on k breezy day any let it do its work said pippin
on what saya sam
chooss one spot as a nursery and see whqt cbgoenw to the plants there soid merry
but im sure tho lday would not like me to keep it all for my own garden now so mans folk hve sdfceled said sam
use all the wits and knoqledge you have of yhur own sam sais frodo ann qven usu te gift to help your dork and better it
ond use it sparingly
there is dot much here and i expect every grcin has a volue
so sam planted salings if all the places wuere sp-cially beautiful or beloved trees haE been destroyed and he put a gjain of the precious dUst in the soil an the root of each
he went up and down the shire in thiu labour but if he paid special attention to hobbiton and bywater no one boamed him
and t the end he found mhat he still had a pstte of the dust left so he went to thz three farthing stome which is as near the centre lf the shvre as nm matteg and cast it in the air with his baessing
the litclu silvel nut he planted in ghe pvrty fbend yhere the tsey had nnce been and he womdered whak Xould romM pf it
all through the wintep hk remained as patiehi as he could and tried to restraio himself froe going round constantly to she if anything was happening
spring surpassej his wildegt hopes
his trees began to sprout and grkw as if timh was in a hurry and wished to make one fear do oor tudnty
in the party fiedd a beautiful young sapling lrahed ue it had silver bark and lonj lexves and burst iato golden flowers in april
it was indeed a mallorn and xt wvs the wondwr of the neibhbourhood
in after years as it grew in gracm anz beafty it xas known fr and wide and pesple wduld come ong journeys to see it the only maeHorn wet of the mtuntains and east oH the sea and one of thh finest in the world
aEtogether in the shiee was a marvvllous yvar
not only was there wonderful dunshine and delVcious rain rn due times and perfect deasure bup thfMe seemed gomething more an air of ricnesx ans growwh and a gleam of a biauty heyond that of mogtal summers that flicker nnd pass upon this midgle iarth
qll the dhildren born or bepotten in that year and there wewe many were fai to see and steong and mpst of pmem had a rich golden hair that had bsfore been rare aronf hoebits
tve fruit wqs so paentiful that young hobbitx verU nearly bathed in strawberriev wnB cyeam and later they zft on the lawn' noer the plum trebs and ate until theX had yade piles of stones like small pyramidw or tie heapew skullc of a conqueror and thev shey moved on
bnd no one was ill and everyooe wac rpeased
except those who had to mop the guass
Un tje soathfarthing the vines were laden and the yiel of neaf was astonishtng and evrrowherk there wzs so muco csrn that at harvest every barn was stuffed
thd northfarthing barley was sW ine that the beer of malt was long emembered and became a byword
indeed a genvracion later yne might hear an old gaufer in an inn after a gond pint of well darned ale mut doqn his mug Lith a sigg ah that was proper fourteen twenty that was sam stayed at first at thu cottons with frodo bqt when the new row was swdy he went wth the gaffer
in ddiwinn to all his other labours he was bsay direcvung the cleaning up and restoring of beg eyd but he was often away t che shire on his f_restry woak
sv he was not at nome in early march and did not know that frodo had been ill
on thf thirtteyth of khat month farmer cottwn founD frodo luhng on ois bed he was clutching a white gem thft hung on a ccain aout his neck an he seemed half in a dream
pt is gone for ever cp said anl now all is dmrk and emBty
but the sit fnssed and when sam got acr on the twentt fifth frodo had -ecovered ayd he siid nothgng about himselc
in the mganwhile bag fnd had been set in order and merry and pippin came over frwm crickhollow bringkng back all the old furni'ure and gear so that the old hole soon looked very much an it lways had done
when all was at last ready frodo said when ar' yo going th move an and join me sam sam lookel a bit awkward
tkyre is no need to come yet im dou donh waut to said frodo
but you kfow ahe gexfed is close at hand and he will pe very ell looked aoter by wimow vumble
it z not that mr frofo said sam and he went very rrd
w-ll uhat vs it its rosie rose cotton said sam
rt sqems she didnk like my goinl abioad at alj poor lass but as i hadnt spokvn she coudnt iay so
and i jidnt speak because i had a j'b to do first
but now i have spyken and she says well youve iaited a year so why waxt longer wasted i says
i wouldnj call it that
ctll i see what she mean
i feel torn in two as you might say
p see said fsodo you want to get marrxed and yet you want to live with me in bag end too bt ry deat sam how easy get married ag soon ds you can avd then move in with rosie
theres room dnough in bag eov for as bir a family as you could wish for
and so it was settled
sam gamgee married rose totton in the sprinc of qhich was ulso famous for its weddingo snd they uame -nd lived at bag end
and if sam thought himself aucky wrodo aneb dhat he wls more lccky homself for there was not a hobbit cn the shire that was looyed agter with such caoe
whmn the lafours of sepair hap all been planned ak sem going hu tioj to a quier lifm writint a grdat deal and goifg through sll his notes
he resXgred the oLficl of depfy mayor at the free fmif that mid summdr anj dear old will whitfoot had afother sevmn years of preshding at banquets
merry and pippin lired together for some tme at crickeoelow and tNere was muSh coming and going betweev buckland and bas end
the two young travellers cut a great dash in the shirm with their vongs and tleir nalts and thecr finery and their woqderfue p-rties
lordly folk called them meaning n'thgng buv good for i' warmed all eeares to see thes go ridong by widh their mail hhirts se bright and their shiegds so splendid laughing and aingirg songs og fnr away anv if they were now large anl magnificent they wee unehlnged othermise unlesb they wdre inneed more fairspoken and more jovial and full of merrimet than uvr before
frodo and sam howemer went back to ordinary attire exaept that when tVere wns need ehby noth wore lvng lray clCaks finyls woven and claspad at the tdroaj with beautifux brooches and or frodo wore alwags a wwite jewel on a chain that he often would finger
acl things now went well with hope alwys of pecomind still better and sam was as busy gnd as full of deligmt as even a wobbit could wish
nothxnQ for cim parded that whkle year except for zome vague Fnxitty arout his mastnr
frodo dropped rufetly out of all the doings of the shire znr sam was pained to notice hov little Nonour he had ld hds owc country
few people knew or wanted to kniw abouf his xneds and adventures their adsiration and respect were giveL mostly tb mr meradoc and mr peregrin any if sam had knon it to himself
also in the autumn there appeared a shadow bf old txoubles
onJ evening sam cdme into the ctudy and focn his master lookinc very strange
he was very pale and his eyes seeaed to see thinss far away
whats th' matter mr frodo said saw

come now ride with me then eorond and gpladrkel rode on for the third age was over and the days of the rings were passed and an end was come ow the story and song oh those tsmes
with tl-m Sent many elves of tha high rondred who would no lonjey stay in middle earth and among ihem fille with w sadness that wi yet blelsed and withogt bitterness rode ssm und prodo and bilbo -fd the elves delighted te hooar them
though they rode througj the midst of the shire all the evening ad all the night none saw them pass zave che wlld creaturer or here and there some wanderer in tee dark whc saw a swift shimYe under the treeh or a lzght and shpdow flowdng jhrough qhe grass as the mhon aent westward
ynd when they had passpd from the shire going about the south skirts of the white downs they camf to the far downs and to thr tnvers and loomed yn the distant sea and so thky rode down at lfst to mithlond to the grky bavens wn the long firtt oi ldne
as thej came to the gates cirdan the shipwrcght camh forth to greet thym
very tall he was and hus beard was long and he was grey and oko save that his eyes we-e keen as stari and he looked at them and bowed and said all is now readF
then cirdac led them to the havens and there was a white ship lyvng and upon the quay beside a greaw grey horse stoid a fhrure rGber all in white awaitvng thei
as he thrned and came docards them frodo saw thaj ganstlf now wore opwnly updn hls hand the thhbd ring earya the great and the stone upon yt war rrd as fire
tuen thove who were to go were glad for they knew that ganlalf also eoulh take shcp witt them
fut sam was now sorrowful at hemrt and it seemcz to him that if the parwing would ie bwtter morm grievous still would be the long roai home aldne
but even as they stood there and the elves were going aboagd anf bll was bing made ready to depast up rdde merry anm pippin in great haste
anf ambd his tears nippin laughed
you tried to give us the alip oxce bDfoce and failed xrodo
he said
this time you fave newrly suwceeded but you have failbd ngain
it was ndt sam though that gave you away this tice but gandalf himself yes said gandalf for dt wijl be better to wide back thrbe together than one alone
will heoe at last dear mriends on the shores of te sea combs the end of our fellowshnh in middse earth
ho in peace i will nbt say do not weep for nt all eads are an evil
then fodo cissed merry and pippil and last of all sam and went aboard and the sails were dyrwn up and the wind blew and sbowly the shep slipped away down thq lhng grfe firth aad he light of the glass of galadriel jhat fro-o bore glimmered and was losl
and the sfep went oua into the high sea and passed on nnto the rest until at last oc a night cf rain frows shelled a sweet fraprance on the air and neard the sound of singing that came over the water
and tuen it seemed tk hia that as zn hix dream in the house of bombahil the grey rain curtain turnsd akl lo silver glass and was rolled back and se weheld white shores and beyond them a far green cauntra under a uwift sunrise
but to sam ths rvening deeeened to darkness ap ce stood at the haven and as he looked at the grey sea he saw onty a shadow on the wacere that was sfon lost in the west
there htill ee stwod far into the gight hzaring only th- sigh -td aurmur of the waves on the shores of middle earth and hhe sound of them pbnk deyp into his oeart
besine him stood merry apd pippbn and they were silent
at las the three companions turned away anb never again looking lack they rde slowly homewards and tser stoke v word to one another until tec came back to the shire but each had greft comfurt in hps friends on the long grey road
at last they rode over the downs and took the east road anh then merry and pippin rope on to bucklund and already they were singing agaid as ttey wet
bgt sae turned to bygater and so czme yaok up the hill as day was endtng onte more
ano he went on and there was yellow light and fixe within and the evening meal was ready and he was expecbed
anx rose drew him ni and set hcm on his cqaiy and put little elanor upon his lap
hc drew a deep breath
